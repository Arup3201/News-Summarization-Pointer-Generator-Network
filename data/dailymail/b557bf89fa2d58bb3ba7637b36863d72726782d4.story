Raheem Sterling has admitted that he would prefer if Liverpool teammate Luis Suarez was not playing when England meet Uruguay in their decisive Group D clash on Thursday.

The 19-year-old was a revelation after being selected to start against Italy in England's opening 1-0 defeat in Manaus, where Roy Hodgson's gamble paid off handsomely with an electrifying display from the Liverpool forward.

Reflecting on the game, Sterling said: 'I wanted to show the world what I can do. I was a bit nervous at first.'

Take a bow: Raheem Sterling revealed he wanted to 'show the world what I could do' against Italy

Red hot! Raheem Sterling was a revelation in England's opening 1-0 defeat to Italy in Manaus 

Sterling was central to most of England's attacking moves and briefly had the nation celebrating when he appeared to score in the first-half before the realisation that his effort had hit the side netting.

The youngster has staked his claim to start against Uruguay where he could line up against his club teammate and current Premier League Player of the Year Luis Suarez.

While Sterling would prefer if the Uruguay striker wasn't playing, he insists that England should not concentrate all of their energies on trying to stop Suarez.

'I'd rather not see him on the pitch. We know he can score some spectacular goals.'

'But, we can't just think about Luis Suarez, they have other players. He is a great player and most of our defenders have played against him before.' 

Meanwhile, Frank Lampard has admitted that, despite their encouraging start, failing to get a result was not good enough from the squad.

'Steven (Gerrard) and I spoke to the squad, the moment we are happy with losing but playing well is not good enough. It is do or die, just like it was in 2010.'

We go again! Frank Lampard has labelled England's game against Uruguay as 'do-or-die'
