From choosing the perfect party beverage for babies to picking the ideal double-barrelled baby name, new book When One Is Expecting: A Posh Person's Guide To Pregnancy And Parenting has the answers.

Written by the creator of the @pippatips Twitter account, the hilarious tome is packed with wonderfully inane Pippa Middleton style advice.

Included are such gems as 'toxic things are more harmful during pregnancy so it may be best to avoid any of your more gossipy friends' and 'if something makes you feel faint during pregnancy, DO NOT do that thing!'

Pippa tips: The new pregnancy books features lots of inane gems that could have been penned by Pippa herself

Like Pippa's much-maligned effort Celebrate!, the book also includes plenty of gorgeous illustrations, although unlike the real Pippa's work, none feature the anonymous author.

The creator of @pippatips did, however, hint at a possible unveiling during an exclusive interview with MailOnline, saying: 'I’m sure my ghostwriters will want some attention at some point.'

Talking about the tips, the author also explained why the book was written and revealed which of the many tips was his or her favourite.

'A publisher made a pleasing financial offer so after a few moments of 
hard thought the idea for When One Is Expecting just popped into my 
head,' @pippatips revealed.

'Baby Reign in the 3.25 at Chepstow [is my favourite]… But seriously there are so many tips to 
choose from, it's hard to pick one that's best although the tips for naming your child 
will prove an invaluable resource for those who are struggling to name 
their child.'

The author also revealed more about her research methods, saying: 'It may surprise you but most of the tips were thoroughly researched.

'For
 instance, a friend didn't put a nappy on her child and the cream 
Axminster got awfully messy after a little while.'

Fan? Will the Duchess of Cambridge read the book? @pippatips thinks her butler will read it to her

Asked where she sourced her facts, the author replied: 'Well it transpires that there’s all sorts of useful information you can 
get off the Internet by using the Google website.

'Though here’s a 
Pippa Tip for you: Safesearch can ensure you never have to try and unsee 
some of the images I have seen whilst researching this tome.'

The author also had some useful advice for the real Pippa as she carves out a new career as a Vanity Fair contributing editor.

'If she can find compelling things to write about, and do so using words 
that entertain and delight Vanity Fair’s readers, I think she could be 
onto a winner.

'I have [also] advised Pippa to stay away from tongue-in-cheek - no one wants a bitten glossus.'

While the new book from @pippatips is full of advice for non-royal mothers, the question everyone is asking is whether or not the Duchess of Cambridge will make use of its words of wisdom as she looks forward to the birth of her first child next month.

@pippatips is confident she will. 'The Duchess is now a member of the Royal Family. I'm fairly sure she has a butler or maid who will read it to her.'
