Big Brother star Josie Gibson was in court to support her grandmother, who is facing jail for drug offences.

The reality TV personality joined other members of her family at Bristol Crown Court yesterday to see Diane Gibson, 72, sentenced.

The grandmother had been on the run for over 12 years, having been convicted in 2000 at Bristol Crown Court of possessing cocaine with intent to supply.

Big Brother star Josie Gibson arrives at Bristol Crown Court for the case of her grandmother Diane Gibson, who is set to sentenced on drug charges after 12 years on the run

Diane Gibson disappeared in 2000 after she was found guilty of possessing with intent to supply 3kg of cocaine worth £240,000

She fled after being caught with 3kg of the drug worth £240,000.

Detectives feared the woman - dubbed 'Britain's most wanted grandmother' - may have changed her appearance and fled to Spain.

But police finally caught up with her and she was arrested last month at the home of a relative in Yate, south Gloucestershire.

Yesterday she returned to court to be sentenced.

Gibson waved to family members in the public gallery, including the Big Brother star, as she was brought up from the cells.

The case was adjourned at the request of Gibson’s barrister Giles Nelson for five weeks to allow medical reports to be compiled, which may affect sentencing.

He told Judge Michael Longman that Gibson suffers from heart problems and is seeing specialists at hospitals in Bristol.

'The upshot is that she is using a wheelchair because of heart problems and blood pressure which has affected her mobility,' Mr Nelson said.

Mr Nelson said that Gibson was still maintaining her innocence and an earlier appeal had been rejected.

Josie Gibson defended her grandmother on Twitter, saying people didn't know the truth and that she was 'heavily against drugs'

Adjourning the case until next month and
remanding the pensioner in custody, the judge told her: 'I am 
adjourning until June 10 so that those defending you can find out 
further information that may assist you.'

Gibson, from Yate in south Gloucestershire, replied: 'Yes sir, I am not guilty anyway.'

Last month reality TV star Miss Gibson, 28, from Bristol, defended her grandmother.

She
wrote on Twitter: 'A few articles about my Nan just to clear up people 
don’t know the truth. I lived with her and my aunty and she is heavily 
against drugs!'

Josie Gibson became well known when she won Big Brother 11 three years ago. Since then she has lost a remarkable 6st, launched a fashion line and made a fitness DVD.
