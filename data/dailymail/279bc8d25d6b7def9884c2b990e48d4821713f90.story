The children of Nelson Mandela have launched a court case against several business associates of the former president in a dispute over the control of two companies, a South African newspaper said.

The Star says the case was filed Monday in the Johannesburg High Court by Mandela's daughters, Makaziwe and Zenani.

It was supported by the grandchildren of the anti-apartheid leader, who recently left a hospital after treatment for pneumonia.

The court papers reportedly say lawyers George Bizos and Bally Chuene, and businessman Tokyo Sexwale, have no right to remain as directors of companies whose main purpose was to channel funds from the sale of 94-year-old Nelson Mandela's handprints.

The newspaper quoted Bizos as saying the Mandela daughters are 'trying to get their hands on the money', estimated to be more than Â£1.1million.

The two daughters claim that Bizos, Sexwale and Chuene were never appointed by Mandela as major shareholders or directors. Bizos claims the allegations are completely false.

'There is no basis to the allegations. We are not hijackers. We don't hijack things.

'We are confident we were regularly appointed at the wish of Mr Mandela five years ago.'

The South African presidency announced 
the 94-year-old had been cleared to leave the Pretoria hospital 
following 'a sustained and gradual improvement in his general 
condition.'

Nelson Mandela was discharged from hospital on Sunday following a nine-day stay for treatment of pneumonia.

It was the third hospital visit for 
the former anti-apartheid leader since December when he underwent 
treatment for gallstones and a lung infection.

Makaziwe
was from Mandela's first marriage to Evelyn Ntoko Mase, which collapsed 
in divorce in 1957 and Zenani is from his second marriage to Winnie 
Madikizela-Mandela, who he was also separated from.

Mandela
remarried to Graca Machel, widow of Samora Machel, the former 
Mozambican president and ANC ally who was killed in an air crash 12 
years earlier, on his 80th birthday in 1998.
