Teachers should not tell teenagers to stop watching porn, according to government-backed guidelines.

Pupils must instead be taught the difference between real-life relationships and the distorted world of X-rated films.

This could involve playing card games in class to decide whether various sexual scenarios belong on ‘Planet Earth’ or ‘Planet Porn’.

Children should be taught about porn to help them protect themselves, charities say in new guidance (file image)

Porn-addicted secondary school pupils should also be advised to seek help from a ‘trusted, non-judgmental adult’.

Schools
 should give lessons on pornography to teach pupils that it shows a 
'distorted image' of sex and relationships, according to new guidance.

Youngsters
 need to learn that pornography does not reflect real life, often 
showing 'perfect' bodies and exaggerated sexual prowess', it says.

The
 document - which has been criticised by an education campaigner for 
'taking children's childhoods away from them' - also calls for students 
to be told about the dangers of 'sexting' - sending explicit text 
messages - and sharing sexual photos and images.

The
 new guidance has been drawn up by sexual health charity Brook, the PSHE
 Association and the Sex Education Forum in a bid to give schools advice
 on how to teach pupils about the topic.

It comes in the wake of a report published by Ofsted last year which found that sex and relationships education (SRE) needs to be improved in more than a third of schools.

The guidance comes weeks after teachers said children were accessing porn on their phones at break (file image)

It
 called for secondary school pupils to learn more about issues such as 
porn, relationships, sexuality and staying safe, rather than just the 
'mechanics' of reproduction.

Teachers
 have also spoken out about the issue, with one survey suggesting that 
schoolchildren are increasingly having sexually explicit conversations 
with each other after being exposed to pornography.

The
 new advice, which has been welcomed by ministers, says schools should 
teach about the impact of pornography, arguing that there is widespread 
support from parents for this.

'Teaching
 should emphasise that pornography is not the best way to learn about 
sex because it does not reflect real life, and can therefore be 
worrying, confusing and frightening for young people,' it says.

But education campaigner Chris McGovern, of the Campaign for Real Education, criticised the report's suggestions

He
 told MailOnline: 'Internet pornography is a serious issue but schools 
need to consult with, and reach agreement with, parents before teaching 
about it.

 

'Many parents do not wish to see their children having their childhood taken away from them - blanket solutions just will not work'

  - Chris McGovern, Campaign for Real Education

'Many parents do 
not wish to see their children having their childhood taken from them - 
they would prefer infants to learn about Thomas the Tank Engine rather 
than how to handle porn.

'With regard to this matter 'blanket solutions' just will not work.'

The report also says: 'Pupils should understand that 
pornography shows a distorted image of sex and relationships, including 
'perfect' bodies and exaggerated sexual prowess.

'SRE
 provides opportunities to discuss body image and understand how 
pornographic pictures and videos are routinely edited and 
'photoshopped'.'

The
 document goes on to say that young people are growing up in a culture 
where technology and social media are important and there are more 
opportunities for sharing personal information.

'SRE should encourage pupils to think about what they want others to know and see about them - whether on or offline.'

It
 adds: 'Research shows that sexting is of most concern to young people 
in their early teens, schools should address privacy and boundaries from
 a very early age in the context of personal safety and abuse.

'Specific work about 'sexting' should be addressed in SRE as soon as it is identified as a potential issue.'

The advice also warns schools that SRE should be inclusive and that teachers should not assume that all relationships are between opposite sexes.

It suggests that sexual health information should include lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in case studies, scenarios and role-plays, with pupils exploring topics from different points of view.

Brook chief executive Simon Blake, said: 'Young people have been telling us for years that SRE is not relevant to their lives and they want better.'

The Government already publishes statutory guidance for schools on SRE and the new document, which was welcomed by Schools Minister Lord Nash, is supplementary advice.
