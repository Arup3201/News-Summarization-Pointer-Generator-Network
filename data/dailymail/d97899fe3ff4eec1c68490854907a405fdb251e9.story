BBC World Cup pundit Robbie Savage came within minutes of missing his flight to Brazil after taking his wife's passport to the airport.

The former Wales international, who will line up alongside the likes of Gary Lineker and Rio Ferdinand on screen this summer, only realised his mistake when he arrived at Heathrow.

Fortunately somebody was on hand to deliver Savage's correct ID and he was rushed through security in order to make his flight to South America.

The ex-Blackburn midfielder tweeted: 'Wow thank you @britishairways great staff for rushing me through as I turned up with my wife's passport just got mine in nick of time'

Savage later posted: '2nd time it's happened I'm going to have to tell my wife to get her haircut', before tweeting a picture of himself and his wife with the message: 'Nearly passed for her to be fair!'

The 39-year-old will fly a total of 25,000 miles and visit five cities during his month in Brazil.

Wise words: Savage will work for the BBC during the month-long World Cup in Brazil
