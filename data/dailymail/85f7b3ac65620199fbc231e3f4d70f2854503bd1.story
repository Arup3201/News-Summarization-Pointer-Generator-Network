You perhaps wouldn’t expect the brash TV presenter Johnny Vaughan to live in a such an elegant house, with calm neutral shades throughout and beautifully co-ordinating fittings. But Johnny and his wife Antonia’s home in Wandsworth is exactly that: a tranquil oasis in a busy part of London.

With a secluded walled garden at the back, their property has given them both privacy and a great space for entertaining for 14 years.

But now Johnny – whose new series of Mud Men, which sees him digging around in River Thames mud unearthing relics from the past, will be shown on the History Channel next month – is ready to move on.

Absolute gem: TV presenter Johnny Vaughan is selling his £3.5million Victorian home in London's Wandsworth

He and Antonia have already found a bigger house nearby that better suits them and their two children – Tabitha, 12, and Rafferty, nine. Their current home is on the market for £3.5 million.

Houses in their street were built as show homes for the Great Exhibition of 1851, which drew hordes of people to London from around the UK.

At that time, much of the area was still fields, while Clapham Junction station – now the busiest in the country – hadn’t even opened.

The road forms part of a conservation area, with Wandsworth Common close by. Most houses are semi-detached, though some, like the Vaughans’, are detached.

Time to go: Johnny Vaughan and Antonia are leaving their home after 14 years

Almost all the architectural styles of Victorian London are here – Gothic gables, classical designs, Italian Renaissance – and they also feature bay windows.

Johnny, 46, can thank Antonia for the tasteful renovation of their four-storey gem.

The lower-ground floor has a family room and a large kitchen/dining room with limestone steps leading to the garden.

On the upper-ground floor, the  main sitting room has two sets of French windows opening on to a balcony, again with steps to the garden, and a second reception room.

There’s plenty of space for four bedrooms on the two top floors, although the Vaughans use the first floor for a master bedroom suite with a large dressing room, and the top floor for the children’s bedrooms and a bathroom.

Antonia, 42, used the skills she learned on a course with interior designer Kelly Hoppen to complete the project, and clearly no expense was spared.

Her favourite room, the kitchen, was redesigned to make the most of the link with the garden. The back wall was replaced with glass folding doors, and a limestone terrace for al fresco dining leads to steps up to the garden.

The clean lines of the contemporary kitchen, with its smooth Corian worktops and large central island, were chosen by Antonia, as were the bespoke wooden shutters on all the other floors.

The house is a hymn to harmony, with polished wood floors, limestone fireplaces and Lefroy Brooks bathroom fittings.

Underfloor heating, Lutron lighting with multiple settings and surround-sound systems on three floors add to the high-spec finish.

The Vaughans knew they were 
stretching their budget when they bought the house for £900,000 in 1999,
but Antonia wanted it more than any of the others they saw.

Wandsworth
has since moved dramatically upmarket, with demand from the so-called 
Nappy Valley set – families searching for good-sized houses, decent 
schools and green spaces.

Space to breathe: The airy front room has a view of the secluded back garden

Property website Zoopla says a detached home in Wandsworth averages £1.6 million, but estate agent Savills gives the Vaughans’ a top-end guide price of £3.5 million due to its position and high standard of the interior.

The house – the childhood home of broadcaster Louis Theroux – is painted in neutral shades for good reason, says Antonia.

‘You need somewhere calm if you live with my husband,’ she laughs. ‘I like things to be simple but of really good quality. I loved the course with Kelly because it made sense of everything I’d always been drawn to – smooth shapes, symmetry and neutral shades.’

So be warned, Johnny: don’t spoil the look by trampling that Thames mud indoors.
