A pub landlord got so upset during a phone call to his local council that police rushed to his home to check he wasn't suicidal.

Hari Johnston, 49, rang Swale Borough Council to complain about having his plans to convert his pub in Teynham, Kent into a home rejected, and expressed his desperation to have the problem resolved.

Within 10 minutes of Mr Johnston sarcastically asking a council worker if she wanted him to kill himself if he could no longer feed his wife and children, police arrived at his front door to ensure he wasn't a suicide risk.

Concern: Hari Johnston rang Swale Borough Council to complain about having his plans to convert his pub into a home rejected. Within 10 minutes of the call, police arrived to ensure he wasn't a suicide risk

Mr Johnston said he had been certain he would get permission after submitting plans to convert The Railway Tavern in Teynham into a house.

But he was left furious when planning officers at Swale Borough Council rejected the application.

Last week he rang the council to complain about the rejected plans and ended up expressing his frustration to a female member of staff.

Describing the call, Mr Johnston said: 'When I spoke to the lady I said to her ‘I have to feed my children and my wife. What do you want me to do hang myself or jump under a train?'

'Within 10 minutes of hanging up the police were here looking for me. They told me they were taking me to hospital because I was unwell,' he added.

'I was surprised and shocked. I explained to them what had happened and that I’d turned my anger to the lady on the phone,' Mr Johnston said.

'I said "I don’t need to got hospital. I’m absolutely perfect but I’m so angry about Swale council’s position",' he went on.

'I’m not making any money. Last Thursday I had one customer and took just £9.60. If I lose the pub I’ll also lose the shop because the finances are linked to the two businesses... I plan to appeal against the decision,' Mr Johnston added.

Anger: Hari Johnston had been certain he would be allowed to convert The Railway Tavern in Teynham into a large house. He was left furious when Swale Borough Council rejected the application

Mr Johnston bought The Railway Tavern in a bid to save it from closure in August 2009, but the pub is now open for just 21 hours a week after support from villagers dwindled.

Mr Johnston wants to transform the premises into a home for his family because he claims it is 'no longer commercially viable'.

A council spokesman said: 'Our planning department was contacted last week by an applicant who was disappointed with the outcome of a planning application.

'During conversation, the gentleman became agitated and upset, and made comments which raised serious concern for his welfare. The member of staff took advice and contacted Kent Police.'

'Safeguarding of children and adults is a priority for everyone at Swale council, and we make no apologies for ensuring the safe welfare of our community.'

The spokesman also claimed Mr Johnston’s development was turned down because it contributed to 'community facilities in the village'.

He added: 'The proposal fails to demonstrate, by suitable means of market testing, that there is insufficient demand to justify the retention for business and community use.'
