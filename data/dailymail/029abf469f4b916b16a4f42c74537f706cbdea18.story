An 11-year-old boy with muscular dystrophy committed suicide by suffocating himself months after being bullied and robbed of an iPhone.

Mitchell Wilson, of Pickering in Ontario, Canada, was out walking when his face and teeth were smashed into the pavement by a boy from his school.

A 12-year-old was arrested and removed from the school, but Mitchell’s father said his disabled boy was ‘never the same’ after the attack.

Acquitted: A teen accused of beating up and stealing from 11-year-old Mitchell Wilson (pictured) leading to his suicide in 2011, was acquitted from his charges today

Changed: Mitchell's father said his son 'lost that spark you see in a kid's eye' after the robbery

Mitchell was attacked last November for the Apple iPhone he had borrowed from his father Craig Wilson, reported the Huffington Post.

He was scared of bullies who picked on him because of his disability and the attack made him even more stressed and anxious, Mr Wilson said.

'Subsequent to the beating that he took, he just lost that spark you see in a kid's eye,' Mr Wilson told CTV Canada AM.

'He had huge anxiety attacks about going outside and going for his walks and going to school by himself.'

Evidence: Written and oral testimony by Mitchell prior to his suicide was found not reliable enough by the court though the boy's father Craig Wilson says he is keeping his son's side of the story as the truth

Disappointment: Family of Mitchell expressed disappointment after the verdict today while his grandmother Pam Wilson earlier said they 'don't want to be a lynch squad' but hope the alleged attacker is helped for a better life

Conclusion: Concluding the trial, the court's judge said she hopes one day the boy's attackers will one day come forward and take responsibility for their crime

Mitchell lost his mother three years ago to skin cancer - and he was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy last year, reported the National Post.

Doctors had told Mitchell his muscular dystrophy could be helped by walking outside, but he was scared of doing this after the attack.

Phoebe Prince - January 2010The 15-year-old Irish immigrant was racially taunted for three months by classmates in Massachusetts after she dated a popular boy. She was found by her sister hanging in the stairwell of her home.

Tyler Clementi - September 2010The Rutgers University freshman's roommate used secret cameras to record the 18-year-old kissing another man and stream it over the internet. He jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge.

Jamey Rodemeyer - September 2011The gay 14-year-old thanked Lady Gaga in a YouTube video in which he talked about suffering incessant homophobic bullying. He was found dead outside his Buffalo home.

Mitchell committed suicide and was found dead in his bedroom earlier this month on the day he was due to start a new school year.

It was also one day after he received a 
subpoena to testify against his alleged attacker, who cannot be 
identified for legal reasons.

Mr Wilson said his son was embarrassed and apologised to him because he could not stop the attacker beating him up.

The 12-year-old was due to appear in court on Wednesday, but prosecutors said it was too soon after the suicide.

Now there appears to be nobody to testify at the trial and the charge of assault could be dropped. A new trial date has been set for November 21.

Mitchell's grandmother Pam Wilson said his family 'don't want to be a lynch squad' and are only trying to help the attacker have a better life.

The 11-year-old's death is the latest in a string of suicides which came after accusations of bullying.

Just last week gay 14-year-old Jamey Rodemeyer killed himself after being subjected to vile treatment over his homosexuality.

Ann Haas, senior project specialist at 
the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, cautioned against a 
phenomenon known as contagion, in which suicides among people in similar
 circumstances can increase after a very public death.

'Suicide is not a heroic act or something to be emulated or admired,' she said.

'If we portray it as something that is admirable and very sympathetic, vulnerable youth may hear that as, "Look at the attention this case is getting and everyone is feeling sorry and praising this individual," and it can form a narrative that can be compelling.'
