Rory McIlroy revealed he is paying the price for an indulgent Christmas by sharing a picture of his rather sweaty gym t-shirt following a first workout of the new year.

The world No 1 had plenty of reason to celebrate over the festive period having won both The Open and the US PGA Championship during a glorious year on the course in 2014.

But, like everyone else who enjoyed a few too many mince pies in December, McIlroy is now facing up to shedding that holiday weight. 

Rory McIlroy shared this picture of his sweat-soaked t-shirt, and revealed 'my body hates me!'

'First workout of 2015 in the books.... My body officially hates me after Christmas!' said the 25-year-old Northern Irishman on Twitter, alongside a picture of his used gym clothing.

The t-shirt also bore the suggestive message 'F this' (thanks to a clever bit of colour contrasting) - but thankfully the sweat stains covering most of the shirt proves that McIlroy's attitude towards training is an awful lot better than his clothing suggests.

McIlroy has recently been enjoying a spell back at home in Northern Ireland during golf's off-season. The Holywood-born superstar was spotted watching his favouite rugby team, Ulster, in action during the holiday period.

But McIlroy also shared a picture of his clubs on a sunny open-air driving range, proving his time back in Britain has come to an end.

'First range session of 2015 done... First couple of swings after four weeks without touching a club were interesting!' he said.

McIlroy is gearing up for his return to action in 2015. His first tournament will be the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship, which begins in the Emirate on January 15.

The planet's best golfer he may be, but McIlroy will have to be at his best to win the first big-money event on the European Tour's 2015 schedule.

World No 2 Henrik Stenson, No 5 Justin Rose and three-time champion Martin Kaymer will be among the 126-man field challenging for the title, which will be defended by Ryder Cup hero Jamie Donaldson.

American star Rickie Fowler will also make his debut in the Middle East alongside more veterans of the duel at Gleneagles, Victor Dubuisson, Thomas Bjorn and Stephen Gallacher.
