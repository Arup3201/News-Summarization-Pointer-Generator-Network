British jewellery designer Sandra D’Auriol suffered extreme postoperative delirium

When British jewellery designer Sandra D’Auriol came round from the general anaesthetic she’d been given for facelift surgery in January, it rapidly became clear something was wrong.

The married mother-of-three, a wealthy socialite, awoke gripped by panic, fought with a nurse, then fled from a security guard and climbed to the top of the hospital block. 

There, the 53-year-old stripped naked and leapt to her death.

In April this year, a coroner’s inquiry in Los Angeles ruled that D’Auriol’s death in Beverly Hills was accidental and ‘linked to her suffering a postoperative neurobehavioral disturbance’.

In Britain, the condition is commonly known as postoperative delirium.

D’Auriol’s death appears to have been an extreme case. 

But according to the NHS treatment watchdog NICE (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence), the condition in its milder forms can affect up to half of patients who undergo surgery in Britain.

Too often, the symptoms go entirely unrecognised and unreported, says NICE.

It is believed to be a specific problem with general anaesthetics but not local, arising because of the time spent in a deep state of unconsciousness.

Research shows that patients with acute forms may not recognise even close family. 

They may become paranoid, developing an extreme and irrational fear or distrust of people.

Other symptoms may include restless behaviour, sleepiness or physical changes such as difficulty in walking, swallowing or speaking.

For many the symptoms are mild and last only hours or days. 

But one in 20 who develops the condition suffers symptoms for a month or more, according to the NHS. 

In extreme cases the condition may cause changes in personality, such as easygoing people becoming aggressive — and it may leave them mentally debilitated for life, with memory and attention problems.

Doctors have known about postoperative delirium since the Fifties, though debate continues about its exact causes.

Until recently, anaesthesis was thought unlikely to be responsible. 

Surgeons pointed to alternative causes, including the theory that the stress of surgery may exacerbate existing brain problems such as depression or early-stage dementias.

But in recent years, evidence has emerged that the risk of postoperative delirium rises when patients are given substantial doses of anaesthetics that put them into deep states of unconsciousness, rather than lighter doses that induce ‘regional anaesthesia’ to block sensations from specific areas of nerves, as happens in epidurals.

In a study at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, in Baltimore, U.S., researchers compared 57 elderly hip surgery patients given low doses of the drug propofol as a regional anaesthetic with 57 patients given large doses of the same drug as a general anaesthetic. 

Eleven of the patients given local anaesthetic became delirious after the operation, compared with 23 of the general anaesthetic patients.

However, other theories suggest that some people’s brains are more vulnerable to harm caused by anaesthetic drugs than others. 

This may be especially true of older people.

Anaesthetics are believed to work by targeting proteins on the surface of neurons (nerve cells) that are essential for controlling functions such as sleep, attention, learning and memory. 

Ageing brains tend to have fewer proteins on these neurons, so anaesthetics may somehow overpower the neurons and cause lasting damage.

Anaesthetics are also thought to work by disrupting communications between regions of the brain, and this may also induce unconsciousness.

In some people, the brain is thought to have more trouble re-establishing communications after the patient has come round.

A University of Massachusetts Medical School study followed 225 patients aged 60 and over, for a year after heart surgery.

In tests of memory and attention, those who did not develop delirium generally took less than a month to recover mentally. 

But those who had suffered post-op delirium for more than three days after surgery had still not regained their mental powers a year later, suffering problems similar to those found in the early stages of dementia.

Such studies have prompted experts to suggest that the anaesthetics cause problems with ageing brain cells’ ability to communicate with each other, which may affect people from their mid-40s onwards.

Children’s growing brains can also be seriously disrupted by surgery — a condition called paediatric anaesthesia emergence delirium.

In May, a study by experts at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children found that up to one child in five may show behavioural problems a week after going under general anaesthetic to have teeth taken out.

Now, new research from the same hospital suggests children may be spared the worst effects of post-op delirium by giving them a sedative called an a2-adrenergic agonist while they are under the anaesthetic. 

Amelia Pickard, who led the analysis, says this may reduce their risk of emerging from surgery in a state of traumatised delirium.

This class of drug has been found to protect brain cells from damage when the brain is anaesthetised.

In April’s edition of the British Journal of Anaesthesia, Dr Pickard adds that previous studies indicate that the drug may slow children’s recovery slightly, though she doesn’t believe this delay will cause problems.

Dr Valerie Page, a consultant in intensive care at Watford General Hospital, maintains that the NHS can do much more to prevent postoperative delirium. 

She is currently researching whether a statin drug may relieve symptoms — Simvastatin may help by reducing inflammation in the brain, she says.

Such inflammation can cause nerve damage. But it is not yet certain what causes it — the trauma of surgery, the anaesthetic or a combination of both.

Meanwhile, Dr Page says, simple steps such as ensuring patients drink enough water can make a huge difference. Good hydration helps to improve blood flow to the brain. 

Getting patients out of bed can help them regain their sense of orientation, while sleeping well helps them regain their bearings.

In the case of postoperative delirium, such straightforward care can make the difference between a healthy recovery and long-term mental problems — or even fatal tragedy.
