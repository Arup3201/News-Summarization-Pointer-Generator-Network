A man who claims to have captured and killed Bigfoot after luring it with pork ribs now says he is planning to take the corpse on an international tour.

Rick Dyer, who describes himself as 'best Bigfoot tracker in the world' and claims to have shot the beast near San Antonio in Texas in September 2012, says the world tour will begin on February 6 in Flagstaff, Arizona, with further locations to be revealed over the coming weeks.

Although he also released a second photograph supposedly showing the dead Bigfoot, there is a great deal of scepticism over their authenticity, not least because Dyer was previously involved in a Bigfoot hoax in 2008 when a 'corpse' he put on public display turned out to be a rubber suit.

Mr Dyer claims that he lured the beast by nailing pork ribs he had bought from Walmart to a tree in San Antonio, Texas in September 2012.

He initially released a grainy close up photograph supposedly showing the creature's face, but has now released a second photograph of it lying dead on the floor of his tent.

Speaking about inevitable doubts over the authenticity of his supposed kill, 36-year-old Dyer told New York Daily News that he doesn't regret his 2008 hoax, as it put him in contact with people who now fund his full-time Bigfoot operations ever since.

He claims that without the previous publicity stunt, he would never have been able to 'really' capture a Bigfoot.

Speaking of killing the animal, he said: 'I nailed... pork ribs from the Walmart down the street to the side of the tree, and lo and behold, he came and started eating the pork ribs off the tree.'

Mr Dyer claims to have filmed the creature as he was enjoying his last meal before going to get his gun and 'with tears in my eyes' shooting it dead.

The excitement surrounding Mr Dyer's claims is tempered somewhat by the fact that he was involved in a Bigfoot hoax back in 2008. Back then, as now, he claimed he had the body of Bigfoot. But The National Geographic reported that, once the frozen body began to thaw, the body turned out to be nothing more than a rubber ape suit.

This time Mr Dyer is adamant that his Bigfoot is 'for real'.

He said: 'From DNA tests to 3D optical scans to body scans. It is the real deal. It's Bigfoot and Bigfoot's here, and I shot it and now I'm proving it to the world.'

Mr Dyer has yet to produce the results of the DNA tests and optical scans, but he says he will be holding a press conference soon to answer any questions.

Bigfoot sightings have been reported in forested areas all over the world, but physical evidence - such as a partial or complete body of the creature - has so far proven elusive.
