One of the world’s most tattooed men served as the guest of honour at the International Convention of Tattooists - but at least one person wasn't happy to see him.

A baby was brought to tears as people were given the opportunity to pose for photographs with the American who earned the nickname 'Chess Man' due to the chequerboard pattern covering his head and face.

Matt Gone, originally from Portland, Oregon, didn't appear to be too bothered as the child bawled as she was held by her mother at the event in Bogota, Colombia on Sunday.

Mr Gone, who attends conventions around the world, has over 95 per cent of his body covered in ink, including his eyeballs, tongue and genitals. 

He claims to have begun tattooing his body 24 years ago to disguise physical deformities.

In 2010, he took his obsession to a new level when he injected ink into the whites of his eyes to make them permanently coloured - one blue, the other green.

He carried out the risky operation by himself.

Nearly 50 of the world's best tattoo artists competed in nine categories, including best tattoo and best new artist, during the three-day event.

Winners were chosen by an expert jury and awarded the chance to showcase their work at similar conventions in Venezuela, Brazil, Mexico and Germany.
