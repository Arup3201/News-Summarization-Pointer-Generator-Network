League Two high-flyers Luton Town will rename their home ground the Prostate Cancer UK Stadium for one match to raise awareness of the disease, the club said on Wednesday.

The former top-flight club, now playing in the fourth tier, said the 10,000 capacity of their 110-year-old Kenilworth Road ground represented the amount of men who die of prostate cancer each year in Britain.

The name change will take effect for the match against Wycombe Wanderers on Tuesday.

Luton are chasing promotion from League Two and currently sit sixth in the table

'We are extremely proud to be the first club to partner with a charity such as Prostate Cancer UK by renaming our stadium, albeit temporarily,' chief executive Gary Sweet told Luton's website.

'We felt sure that once the full story emerged about our supporting Prostate Cancer UK, our supporters would understand and fully support the move.

'This is a first for Luton Town and a first in football and we are delighted to be teaming up with a charity which has supported the game, in particular supporters and players past and present, so well.'

It is the first time an English stadium has been named after a charity.

Prostate cancer claims the same number of men's lives a year as the capacity of Luton's home ground

Luton are in the promotion playoff places, occupying sixth position in the table, 12 points behind leaders Burton Albion.

Prostate Cancer UK director of fundraising Mark Bishop, said: 'The power of sport - and in this case football - has helped us reach out to men and their friends and families.

'We thank the club's players, staff and supporters on behalf of the 300,000 men living with prostate cancer in the UK.'
