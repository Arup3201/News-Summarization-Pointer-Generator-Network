There are few experiences more tedious than being stuck in an airport during a long layover.

At least, that's how it's been in the past.

Now, it seems that airports are wising up - offering weary travellers a wide range of activities from the wonderfully extravagant to the straight-up strange.

At Signapore's Changi Airport, weary travellers can visit the airport's indoor butterfly garden between flights

Flyers can also head to the airport's rooftop pool for a refreshing swim - day or night!

Pittsburgh International Airport will soon be announcing winners of an annual lottery meant to control wildlife on airport property.

The winners will gain access to the deer on the airport's designated bow-hunting area - over 800 acres - for the duration of hunting season.

No word yet on how the winners will transport the bucks to their destinations. 

While Pittsburgh may have one of the strangest airport activities on offer, it is by no means the first to feature off-beat amenities and services to flyers.

In Texas, at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, stressed out travellers can relax and stretch between flights at the airport's yoga studio.

Best of all, there's no need to bring your own mat - the studio is fully equipped.

Not a yogi? No problem!

At Hong Kong International Airport, avid golfers can get their between-flights fix at the SkyCity Nine Eagles Golf Course.

It's situated on an island in the middle of an artificial lake and offers services such as equipment rental, baggage storage and a club house restaurant.  

Not to be outdone, Singapore's Changi Airport boasts a Balinese-themed rooftop pool, four-story slide, movie theatre, and even a butterfly garden.

For a culturally-enriching experience, look no further than Incheon International Airport in South Korea - they have their very own museum of Korean culture.

The museum's collection of relics cover a 5,000-year timeline and include early Korean written works and traditional instruments.

At the Sao Paulo - Guarulhos International Airport in Brazil, travellers can take time in between flights to get their teeth cleaned.

The dental clinic is open Monday through Friday and offers cleaning, whitening services, and X-rays for about $40-$60 (£24-£37).

In Japan, combat jet-lag and rejuvenate yourself between flights at Narita Airport's Juko oxygen lounge.

Exotically-flavoured oxygen - think eucalyptus and cinnamon - is pumped into your lungs via self-service tanks. 

A ten-minute session will cost about $6 (£4) while a 20-minute service will run $12.50 (or approximately £8).
