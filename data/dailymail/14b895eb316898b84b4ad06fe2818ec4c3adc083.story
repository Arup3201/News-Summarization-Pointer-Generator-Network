Killer: Frank Hayward Jr, pictured, murdered his wife, two-year-old daughter and attempted to kill his 12-year-old son before shooting himself in a horrific murder-suicide

A Maryland father-of-two murdered his wife, his two-year-old daughter and attempted to kill his 12-year-old son before shooting himself in a horrific murder-suicide on Tuesday.

Steelworker Frank Hayward Jr, 32, his wife, Cynthia, 32, and their little girl, Natalee, were found dead at the family's affluent multistory home in Owings around 8.30am after an anonymous caller reported a domestic dispute to police.

The couple's son, Frank Hayward III, survived the attack but suffered severe burns and cuts to his neck and was rushed to hospital in Washington D.C where he is fighting for his life.

Another woman, believed to be Ms Hayward's great-aunt, was at home but escaped uninjured, according to The Washington Post.

'We are deeply saddened by this tragic event,' Calvert Sheriff Mike Evans said during a news conference.

Mr Hayward had barricaded himself inside the home when police arrived and was making threats before taking his own life.

He had also lit a fire in a bedroom and several others around the house, police said.

Tragic: Natalee, 2, was murdered by her father in the attack on Tuesday

Injuries: Frank III, pictured holding his younger sister, is fighting for his life in a Washington D.C. hospital

Authorities found a handgun in the property and believe the man shot his wife and toddler.

The
individual causes of death remain a mystery however as police said not 
everyone inside the home died as a result of gunshot wounds but wouldn't
elaborate further. Reports suggest the mother and child may have been 
burned to death in the fire.

According to The Post, Anne Arundel County court records reveal the Haywards' 13-year marriage had been a troubled one.

After marrying as teens in 1999, two 
weeks before their son was born, Ms Hayward filed for divorce in summer 
2007 and sought a protective order that September, telling the court 
'there has been a lot of mental and physical abuse over the last nine 
years and threats.'

She wrote that the previous night Mr 
Hayward, a big man with three tattoos on his arms: barbed wire, a 
bulldog and Cindy’s name, had come into her room and put a phone to her 
ear with his girlfriend on the line.

'She
told me she was going to pull me out of work and beat me up,' Ms 
Hayward, who was employed at Anne Arundel Diagnostics, wrote.

In the complaint, she cataloged the domestic abuse she'd suffered at the hands of her husband, who worked at Stephens Pipe & Steel in Bladensburg.

Between June and September, he had hit 
her in the jaw, struck her with pool cue, thrown a bottle of liquid on 
her, and hidden her home telephone and broken her cellphone so that she 
couldn’t call for help, according to the newspaper.

'I want to return home. Right now at mother’s,' she wrote.

But the protective order wasn't finalised.

Critical: Mr Hayward killed himself after murdering his wife and baby but his 12-year-old son Frank III was rushed to hospital and is fighting for his life

According to records, police were called to the Hayward residence in May to conduct a welfare check but found Ms Hayward and her children were not in any immediate danger.

Jacob Cwiek, a neighbourhood friend of Frank Hayward III's told ABC 7 that the boy 'used to have problems with his family.'

'His dad would be rough on him.,' he told the TV station.

Neighbour Patrick Davis, 41, told The Post the Haywards had moved to the exclusive neighbourhood a few years ago.

He said the 12-year-old, or 'Little Frank' as he was known, was a friendly child who often played with other children.

'You never fathom that this would happen in your own neighborhood,' Mr Davis said.
