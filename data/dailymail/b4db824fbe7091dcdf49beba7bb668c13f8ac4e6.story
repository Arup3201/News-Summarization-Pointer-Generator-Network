I cruised through my 20s with a lean physique and - at the very least - a four-pack. But a combination of age, a busy work schedule, a lack of exercise and a new-found love of cheesecake left me staring at 30 with blossoming love handles and an unseemly gut.

To make matters worse, my wedding was fast approaching, and the last thing I wanted to do was to let my fiancee down by looking like a slob in front of all our friends and family.

I was desperate to turn things around, get back in shape and look my best for our big day. Trainer Rich Phillipps, director of Embody Fitness, was there to offer a solution - but it wouldn’t be easy.

Shaping up: Men's Fitness deputy editor Ben Ince, 29, went from fat to flat in eight weeks and dropped from 18 per cent body fat to 7 per cent, as well as reducing his waistline by 4 inches. Here, he is pictured (L-R) at weeks 1, 3, 5, 7 and 8

For starters, I always thought my diet was pretty clean - I was wrong.

For the first two weeks, Phillipps put me on a high-protein, no-carb diet consisting of a kilo of meat and fish a day, with only green veg, nuts and water to accompany it.

This involved planning my food shops and batch-cooking my meals with military precision, and it wasn’t cheap. But once I got used to the idea of food being purely a fuel source, I settled into a manageable - if boring - routine.

After the initial no-carb shock, Phillipps began reintroducing them to help me build muscle, allowing binge days of ‘clean’ carbs on the weekends. Formerly plain-seeming foods such as brown rice suddenly became the highlight of my culinary week.

It wasn't easy! By tinkering with the workouts and adding brutal upgrades - such as wearing a 20kg chain around his neck during farmer's walks to strengthen his upper back - Phillipps forced Ben's muscles to grow

The big day: Ben's fiance - who had been amazingly supportive throughout - was thrilled with the results

Meanwhile, I was making progress in the gym. After two weeks of full-body conditioning workouts - designed to improve technique and kick-start my metabolism - I moved on to three-way body part splits, training chest, back and triceps in one session, then shoulders, biceps and legs in another.

The workouts combined big compound moves such as the deadlift and bench press with strongman exercises such as sled drags and Viking presses, finishing off with isolation moves including curls and flyes (when you lie on a bench use the pectoral and deltoid muscles to lift the weights inwards).

By the end of the eight weeks, my body fat had plummeted from 18.5 per cent to 7.1 per cent, while my abs and obliques were completely shredded, holding just 6mm and 6.2mm of fat.

I’d put on upper-body muscle too, as well as improving my posture by counteracting an imbalance around my scapula that had been giving me grief for years.

What’s more, the diet had worked wonders for my digestive system and reminded me of how much fun weekends are without a crushing hangover.

My fiance - who had been amazingly supportive throughout - was thrilled with the results. I hadn’t looked even remotely this good since the early days of our relationship, and while she wasn’t a fan of the obligatory photoshoot chest wax, my newly rediscovered abs more than made up for it.

The only unexpected drawback was that none of my clothes fitted anymore, but thankfully I’d been planning to go suit shopping at the last minute anyway due to my best man being out of the country.

When my wedding day finally arrived I looked and felt better than I had at any point in my entire adult life. And if I can do it, there’s no reason why you can’t too.
