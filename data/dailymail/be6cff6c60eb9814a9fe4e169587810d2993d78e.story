Miranda Kerr, Victoria Beckham and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley have more in common than wealth, beauty, style and success.

The A-list trio all share a deep passion for wholesome living - and they credit their daily meditation, powerful chakras and positive affirmations for keeping them sane in an industry prone to self-destruction.

Thanks to the glossy stars, mindfulness and clean living, which were once perceived as reserved for 'hippy' and 'bohemian' types, have become synonyms with success, fortune and, quite frankly, all things cool.

The A-list way: A new retreat at Champneys teaches mindfulness, mediation, and yoga loved by Miranda Kerr, left, and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley 

Miranda Kerr is the postergirl for positive living - she has even penned two self-help books, Treasure Yourself and Empower Yourself, packed with uplifting affirmations, while Victoria Beckham keeps her crystals on hand at all times when preparing for fashion shows.

And it's not just supermodels and fashionistas at it. Arianna Huffington, who established the hugely successful Huffington Post, credits daily mindfulness and meditation for changing her life.

Meanwhile, Jordan Belfort puts his success, in part, down to positive affirmations and visualisation.

But can mere mortals incorporate these beliefs and practises into their daily life and create a living as alluring, lucrative and, seemingly, as fulfilling as the world's most powerful?

Sandi Clark and Mike Mayes, who have launched a programme at Champneys based around these principles, think so and believe that if we all acted a little more like Miranda, the world would be a better place. 

Retreat: Sandi Clark and Mike Mayes are running a course, which is called Bring Yourself Back Into Your Life, and aims to help people discover how to put yourself in control of your life, at luxury health retreat Champneys

Sandi and Mike are hosting weekend retreats within the luxurious grounds of Champneys Health Spa with the intent of helping people find themselves and put themselves back into their lives using the techniques and practises that the most successful of A-listers employ on a daily basis.

'Our retreats aim to help you facilitate your ongoing transformation, growth and empowerment. We will work with you on your energy levels of awareness, self-assessment and self-healing and teach you energy management using meditation giving you the skills to take control of your life and your future,' the couple from Devon say.

Sandi and Mike's course, which is called Bring Yourself Back Into Your Life, aims to help people discover how to put yourself in control of your life, learn who you are, how to create a positive reality and be aware of the negative influences in your life. 

The duo aim to help guests find inner peace - that quiet place so rarely experienced in today’s stressful world - via mindfulness and meditation. 

And what better place to host it than at Champneys, which was the vision of Stanley Lief, who over 85 years ago pioneered the concept of holistic wellbeing, creating a place where people could escape the world’s cares and re-emerge revitalised.

Sleep, meditation and mindfulness are vital skills taught on the course and three things that entrepreneur Arianna Huffington, who describes herself as a 'sleep evangelist', swears by.

Having trouble switching off or need a little 'me time' in the middle of a hectic day? Sandi and Mike believe meditation and mindfulness are essential. 

'We don't call it meditation, but rather "sitting"', says Mike. 

So how do you do it without getting distracted by thoughts of what to have for dinner? 

'Sit comfortably, close your eyes and focus on your breath,' advises Mike. 

'Meditation teaches you to manage your energy: to know how to respond spontaneously to any situation, when to allow your emotions to flow, when to suppress them, and to know the condition of your body. Above all, it enables you to take time out from the relentless activity of your mind, and shows you how to reach a place of peace whenever and wherever you choose. 

'However little you can fit into your day is useful, pop to the toilet for five minutes twice a day and sit quietly. If distracting thoughts pop into your head, acknowledge them and let them pass. There are some great apps for guided meditation out there if you find it hard to do it alone. Next time you can't get to sleep, meditate for thirty minutes instead of reading a book or watching TV; you'll really notice the benefits.'

Visualisation, also known as Mental Imagery, is a technique that has been proven to be extraordinarily successful in producing a specific outcome and is another key skill taught on the course.

Make like Miranda: Sleep, meditation and mindfulness are vital skills taught on the course and there's daily yoga sessions on offer too

'The next time you achieve something you're really proud of, make a note of what it feels like and conjure up that exact feeling when you need a little boost of confidence. It will get you in to the right mindset,' says Mike. 

Want proof that it works? Just ask Jordan Belfort (a.k.a the real Wolf of Wall Street who was a multi-millionaire by the age of 26 and was played by Leonardo Di Caprio in this year's most talked-about movie). He used visualisation before every important business meeting throughout his career.

Sandi and Mike also teach guests the power of their Chakras - or spinning 'wheels' of energy located at seven points in the body.

'Chakras help to maintain your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual balance. Associated crystal gems, colours and scents are often used in Chakra Healing,' said Mike. 

While some find the notion of this a little far-fetched, Victoria Beckham recently revealed her ‘weird’ ritual of using crystals backstage at her fashion shows, specifically Pink Quartz and Black Tourmaline, to balance her chakras.

Well, if it works for her! Victoria Beckham recently revealed her 'weird' ritual of using crystals backstage at her fashion shows, specifically Pink Quartz and Black Tourmaline

See it to believe it: Jordan Belfort (a.k.a the real Wolf of Wall Street who was a multi-millionaire by the age of 26 and was played by Leonardo Di Caprio in this year's most talked-about movie) used visualisation before every important business meeting throughout his career - it sure worked

Revealing the rituals she credits for her success, the former Spice Girl said: ‘If I told you my backstage rituals, and was honest you would think I was a little weird. I carry my crystals with me which some people might think as odd but it works for us.’ 

The rocks are popular among many celebrities including Madonna and Angelina Jolie who believe they have healing powers, although there is no basis in science. 

In between the hourly sessions, guests are treated to all the usual luxuries that Champneys offers, including a Thallasotherapy pool session, which claims to help beat cellulite, and indulgent massages and facials using the super luxe Decleor and Carita ranges.

There are also plenty of exercise classes on offer from high intensity spin to relaxing hatha yoga, and enough surrounding gardens to while away an afternoon if crashing out is more appealing than working out.

While the property is currently undergoing major refurbishment (some of the changing facilities could use some work and a good scrub), the newly revamped bedrooms have unrivalled views of rolling green hills (170 acres worth to be precise) and the spa, which is packed with 60 treatment rooms, is top notch.

Health kick: Food wise, eating like a supermodel is a prerequisite here. The day starts with a green shot (a potent concoction of cucumber, spinach, lime and pear) - and ends with flaxseed pizzas

Food wise, eating like a supermodel is a prerequisite here. 

The day starts with a green shot (a potent concoction of cucumber, spinach, lime and pear) - and ends with flaxseed pizzas. Portion sizes are, however, generous and if it's going to give you skin to rival Rosie Huntington-Whiteley - who credits her daily 'delicious green juice' for leaving her bright eyed and bushy tailed - then hold your nose, knock it back, and let it work its magic.

Several green juices down and armed with the 'tools' loved by Miranda and her glossy pals, you'll feel ready to take on the world, one meditation session at a time. Namaste.

The weekend, which includes two nights' accommodation, costs from £349.00 per person at Tring and Forest Mere.
