He's spent weeks surviving on nothing more than cow's blood and milk, faced down great white sharks and lived for months in the Amazon jungle.

But despite his dark good looks - and impressive survival skills - TV explorer Hazen Audel, 40, says none of it is anywhere near as difficult as finding lasting love, even if he does admit that his constant travels don't always help.

'A great white has the ability to tear your arms off,' chuckles Hazen, who is currently starring in National Geographic's Survive the Tribe. 'But I understand sharks a lot more than women!'

Shark hunt: During his trip to the Solomon Islands, Hazen hunted Great White sharks in a flimsy canoe

Nevertheless, he says he is ready to find someone new - even if things haven't always gone to plan in the past.

'I’ve been giving this love stuff a 
pretty good shot - my last relationship lasted for six years,' explains Hazen.

'And I loved 
being crazy in love. The problem was, it was crazy - it had an uncanny 
resemblance to Fatal Attraction!

'I barely came out of that alive and I was lucky my cat didn’t get boiled! At least I
 know where never to venture again.'

While boiling cats is a definite no-no, Hazen, a regular consumer of gruesome foods, says cooking is a sure way to his heart, although you don't have to be good at it. 

Don't hurt my cat! Hazen says he likes a girl who can cook, although he'd prefer that his cat doesn't get boiled

Tough guy: Hazen spends much of his time travelling, in this case in the Kalahari with the Ju/'hoansi San people

'I rarely complain about the cook’s abilities,' he explains. 'Being able to cook is a major turn on but she doesn’t have to a good one.'

Being able to put up with a night in a tent and a penchant for travel to off-the-beaten track destinations also help, as does being able to shin up a tree - a favourite first date test of Hazen's.

'I have been known to assess a date on whether they climbed a tree with me or not,' he confesses. 'But the best dates I have had are 
the ones where there are sparkles by the end and that just 
plain doesn’t happen that often.'

Part of the reason for that, of course, is Hazen's passion for travelling. Filming Survive the Tribe took him to six different countries and he's currently in Costa Rica working on his other career as a biologist.

Survival skills: Hazen says he likes a girl who doesn't mind roughing it in a tent in the wilderness occasionally

Holiday trip: Hazen says he would take a girl to the Solomon Islands - definitely not Canada's chilly wilderness

Nevertheless,
 he says he would eventually like someone to come home to - and in 
return, would occasionally swap remote wildernesses for 'sand and palm 
trees type places' for the right girl.

'Of course I enjoy travel but if I know it wouldn't be the sort of trip that would be a recipe for 
disaster, then I'd love to share my experiences with the girl of my dreams. 

'For this type of travel I prefer beaches with palm trees, white sand 
and tropical fish. Even better would be with a hut in the village I filmed in the Solomon Islands. Regardless of the sharks, I’d like 
to go back there, hopefully with a lovely girlfriend.'

So what else does it take to impress the intrepid explorer? According to Hazen, looking good and smelling nice are important, although you don't necessarily need to brave tribal living.

'I need a woman that is certainly strong 
enough to rough it camping and loves getting dirty,' he adds. 'But a girl who is 
feminine and smells really nice - yeah! I like that!'

British beauty: Hazen admits to a fondness for 'smart and feminine' British women - ideally from Bristol

British 
women get the thumbs up too, although it's to the West Country rather 
than London that Hazen is looking to for a British love.

'Some of those British women have stolen 
my heart,' he chortles. 'One of the main things that impresses me about British
 women is that they embrace being smart.

'They celebrate being intellectual 
and are not afraid of having educated original thoughts and 
conversation but they also have a refined femininity which I like.

'The problem is, I don’t know many well enough
 to know if they like getting dirty and embracing the rugged. I think I
 need more experience to give a better assessment.

'London
 is amazing,' he continues, 'but in all honesty, it’s too big and crazy for me.  I love it when I visit but I love the smaller towns and countryside too.

Comfort zone: While he is happy to be in remote Mongolia, he says he can only handle small doses of London

Tough guy: Hazen's travels have included a stint with Kenya's blood-drinking Samburu people

'As 
far as cities go, I'm in love with Bristol. I can't wait to get 
back to the UK and I'm hoping to get back as soon as possible.'

In
 the meantime, smart British girls looking for a rugged adventurer will 
have to content themselves with watching Survive the Tribe for Hazen is,
 for now, deep in the Costa Rican jungle.

'I

 help lead trips over there whenever possible,' he explains. 'This time,
 I'm on a two-week adventure with biology teachers from all over the 
world to teach them about the 
tropical rainforest and to discuss new ways of teaching 
science. 

'It’s like camp for a bunch of adventurous, science-obsessed, nerdy, adults - we all have quite a blast.'

When he returns, he says it might be time to start his search for love in earnest, although he adds that he has no intention of putting up with a girl with plans to play games.

'I’m not interested in 
playing games,' he sniffs. 'I am impressed by a woman that does what she says she is
 going to do and knows how to be a good person for herself and others.

'Those are the only kind of women that know a good man when they see it.' Presumably, you imagine, one like Hazen himself.
