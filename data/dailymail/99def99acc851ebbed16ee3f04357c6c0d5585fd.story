Two callous thieves who snatched floral wreaths from a crematorium so they could use them for free at a family funeral have been fined £35 each.

Police caught Richard Boyd, 55, and 41-year old Alan Mayor with seven tributes - left just hours earlier by grieving families - hidden in their car following a tip-off.

When an officer asked them what they were doing, Boyd said: ‘I was just moving the wreaths - I didn’t think I had done anything wrong.’

Mayor then butted in sarcastically saying to his partner: ‘Another one of your plans? Thanks!’

The pair claimed they had ordered flowers for the funeral of Mayor’s father the following day, but instead decided to steal the wreaths from Burnley Crematorium in Burnley, Lancashire, on June 17, after turning up late for the florists and finding it shut.

Boyd, who was brought to and from court 
in a wheelchair and Mayor, formerly of Burnley, but now living in 
Blackburn, admitted theft by finding.

They were each fined £35, with a £15 victim surcharge and Boyd was ordered to pay £50 costs at Burnley Magistrates Court.

Sentencing, chairman of the bench, Irene Divine told the couple the case was aggravated by the number of wreaths taken.

She said it seemed ’rather odd’ several were taken if they were going to use them elsewhere.

Mrs Divine added: ‘I find it quite offensive that you felt that you could go in a crematorium and remove flowers that had been left there for people who had been cremated that day.

‘I wonder how either of you would have felt if the reverse had happened and somebody had done that at the funeral in Lancaster.

‘Your actions could potentially have caused distress to mourners. Whether the wreaths are on a grave or not, to me, is irrelevant.’

The court heard the pair stole the wreaths from Burnley Crematorium, pictured, after arriving late at the florist where they had ordered flowers for Mayor's father's funeral

Andrew Robinson, prosecuting told the court the wreaths had been left outside the crematorium after funeral services held that day.

The wreaths were all returned to the place where they had been left. Mr Robinson added the value of the flowers was not known, but added: ‘I know funeral wreaths can be very expensive.’

Defending lawyer Graeme Parkinson said the flowers were not placed on a grave and would have ‘withered away’.

He said they had all been recovered and put back, adding: ‘As a consequence of that, has anybody actually been upset and distressed by the offence? Probably not. There was potential for causing some distress.’

After being caught driving out of Burnley Crematorium, pictured, Boyd told a police officer: 'I was just moving the wreaths - I didn't think I had done anything wrong.'

Mayor’s father had died, there was a funeral the day after in Lancaster and the two of them had ordered flowers which they were due to pick up that evening. They had got stuck in traffic and missed the closing time at the florist.

Mr Parkinson said they came up with the ‘brainless’ idea to take the wreaths. They accepted it was stupid.

The solicitor continued: ‘Mr Mayor obviously wasn’t thinking straight because of the death of his father and Mr Boyd went along with it, but between the two of them, they should have thought better.

‘Alan Mayor, per se, is not dishonest. Maybe he wasn’t thinking straight, maybe he went along with a harebrained plan.’

Mr Parkinson said Boyd was in very poor health and had signed himself out of hospital against medical advice to attend court.

The solicitor continued: ‘They do both apologise. They do both appreciate the seriousness of this offence and they wish to apologise profusely for their actions on that day.’
