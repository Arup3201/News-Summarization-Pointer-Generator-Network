The identities of a two-year-old boy and his six-year-old sister who died in a horrific apartment fire while their pregnant mother was in hospital giving birth to her third child have been revealed.

Joey Suarez and his sibling Candra Leetch were found unconscious huddled together behind the living room couch following the blaze in San Bernardino, southern California, on Thursday morning.

Five firefighters attempted to revive the youngsters, before they were rushed to hospital with severe burns and smoke inhalation. But despite medics' best efforts, they were declared dead on arrival. 

The children's father, Saul Leetch, was taken to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center with second and third degree burns to most of his body after being found lying on the floor of the property.

It is believed he was trying to rescue his children when he succumbed to the smoke. He remains in a critical condition  and is barely recognizable due to his injuries, Victor Valley News reported. 

The victims' mother, Angelica Suarez, who had been taken to Saint Bernardine Medical Center in labor before the fire broke out at around 3am, gave birth to her second daughter later that day.

She was not told about the tragedy until after her baby's birth, San Bernardino Fire Department Battalion Chief, Michael Bilheimer, said. Her newborn daughter is now in protective custody. 

Speaking on Thursday morning, Ernie Nunez, a family friend, said: 'She's bringing one into this world and she lost two of them, so it's just really bad for them. Just feels really bad for the family.'

Blackened window: Mr Leetch could be heard screaming inside the burning home, which is one of three units in a foreclosed, two-story building. 'He was yelling for help: "Help my kids",' Mr Nunez told KCAL-TV

The blaze was reported shortly after 3am after a neighbor walking a dog spotted smoke spewing from the unit, which is built over a garage and has no smoke detector, Mr Bilheimer said.

Mr Leetch could be heard screaming inside the burning home, which is one of three units in a foreclosed, two-story building. 'He was yelling for help: "Help my kids",' Mr Nunez told KCAL-TV.

Engineer Rodd Mascis told CBS Los Angeles: 'First-in companies arrived on scene and they could hear an adult male inside screaming for help.'

He added that Mr Leetch's 'children were unconscious and not breathing when our firefighter paramedics located them inside the burning apartment'. 

Firefighters managed to get the blaze - which is believed to have originated in the apartment's kitchen - under control within 20 minutes. No personnel were injured.

On Saturday, neighbor Arlene Gonzalez described Mr Leetch and Ms Suarez as lovely people with 'very happy kids... fun, loving.' She added: 'They would break your heart, they were so nice.'

Meanwhile, Kevin Goodly, the principal of Lincoln Elementary School, where Candra was a student, said the youngster lit up a classroom, telling NBC: 'She was a bright little girl...Great smile.' 

Police are investigating the cause of the fire; however, it is not believed to have been deliberate.

The family had been living illegally at the property in the 200 block of West 14th Street and were kicked out at least once before returning, fire officials said.

Wrecked: Police are investigating the cause of the blaze, but it is not believed to have been deliberate. The apartment had blocked exits and was illegally obtaining its electricity, gas and water, according to police

Tearful: Speaking to KCAL9, Mr Leetch's nephew, Josh Suarez, wept: 'Any parent would find a roof for their children. That’s what my uncle did, he found a roof for his kids.' He later wailed: 'Whhhhyyyyyy?'

The apartment had blocked exits and was illegally obtaining its electricity, gas and water from other units, police and fire officials said at a Thursday afternoon news conference.

The city had issued more than $100,000 in fines because of code violations at the home since 2009, authorities said. 'This property should not have been occupied,' City Attorney Gary Saenz said.

But Mr Leetch's nephew, Josh Suarez, said: 'Any parent would find a roof for their children. That’s what my uncle did, he found a roof for his kids.'

He  later wailed: 'Whhhhyyyyyy?'

In memory: The city had issued more than $100,000 in fines because of code violations at the home since 2009, authorities said. Above, tributes for Candra and Joey are left outside the property following the deadly blaze

Ms Suarez's family are currently working on gaining temporary custody of her newborn daughter, according to Victor Valley News.

They are also raising money to cover the Joey and Candra's funeral expenses, as well as legal costs, via a GoFundMe page named 'RIP Candra Leetch and Joey Suarez'. 

The family has been told that Ms Suarez and Mr Leetch may face murder charges for their children's deaths, according to reports.
