Amy Childs has evolved from permatanned, vajazzle-loving TOWIE star to bona fide fashion designer in just a few short years. And there's just no stopping her.

The budding entrepreneur has been busy in the design room working on her party dress capsule collection and now she's ready to showcase the results.

FEMAIL caught up with Amy at her collection’s three year birthday party, where we chatted all things fashion, beauty and Victoria Beckham.

It's party time! Amy Childs, who found fame on The Only Way Is Essex, has been busy designing her new range of partywear just in time for the festive season

Speaking about her new range, which she models to perfection in the new campaign shots, Amy said: 'I’m so proud of my collection. I started it in 2011 with a line of dresses and now I’ve got my AW14 pieces, party dress capsule range, nightwear and casualwear. 

'It’s such a dream - I love every second of it and can’t wait to show you my SS15 collection next year.' 

The star, who shot to fame on The Only Way Is Essex, explained that she's put a lot of thought into this collection.

She said: 'This season I’ve really sat down, looked at all the catwalk and high street trends and come up with pieces that aren’t just my style and suit all trends and women.

'This party capsule was definitely fun to do - I love a bit of sparkle. It wouldn’t be my range without a bit of sparkle.'

Pensive: The star explained that she's put a lot of thought into this collection and that there's something to suit everyone of all shapes, ages and sizes

Citing her style icon as 'elegant' Cheryl Fernandez Versini, Amy says her own personal style has progressed since she was in TOWIE. 

'I love sophisticated style now, definitely, but I still love a fun flirty number or a day dress,' she said.

Amy's collection of tailored dresses has been compared to Victoria Beckham's in the past, but the reality TV star says they couldn't be more different.

'I think my collection is totally different to Victoria’s,' she said. 'I like to think there is something for all ages and all sizes in my range - I have even expanded up to size 18 now as so many curvy women love my range.

'My aim is to give good quality on trend dresses for sensible prices; I’ve even added 14 days interest free credit to my website so everyone can buy a dress they love even before payday. I also really try and think about occasions that you could wear my dresses to for this season as there are so many work parties, new year’s eve dos and obviously Christmas day.

'I try and keep my pieces seasonal with warm colours and flattering fits. Perfect for when you’re tucking in to the choccy on Christmas day.'

Different: Amy, who is a big fan of Victoria Beckham's designs and was recently seen popping into her new shop, said of the comparisons: 'I think my collection is totally different to Victoria's. I like to think there is something for all ages and all sizes in my range'. Amy's dresses cost around £60 and Victoria's around £800

Amy doesn't need to be worried about overindulging this Christmas thanks to her favourite new beauty treatment.

'I am a recent convert to fat freezing. It sounds scary but it’s not I promise! I recently tried a few sessions with a company called 3D lipo and I lost a dresssize - it just melts your fat off and tightens the skin. It’s great for hard to shift areas you’re not happy with and for tightening skin. 

'I definitely would say that’s the new wacky treatment to do right now. I’ve already got some of my friends trying it.'

As well as designing her latest range, the self-proclaimed 'workaholic' has just finished filming Celebrity Dinner Date and is already putting the finishing touches on her SS15 collection, as well as expanding her businesses and  beauty range. 

'This year has already been so hectic - but I love the buzz and I always say I’m a true workaholic,' she said.

The star has big plans for brand Amy. 'I would love to have an Amy Childs Boutique on every high-street one day - definitely one in Liverpool or Manchester - they are so nice up there and love my dresses.

'In five years’ time I would love to have expanded my businesses and be able to bring more of my collection to other areas of the country. 

'I might even have settled down! I’m focused on business right now but I would love to have kids in the future. I’d probably spoil them rotten.'
