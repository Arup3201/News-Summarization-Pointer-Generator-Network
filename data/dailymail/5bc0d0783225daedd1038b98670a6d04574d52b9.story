Brendan Rodgers refuses to give himself the week off when there is a Premier League to be won, despite the majority of his players being away on international duty.

The Liverpool manager was snapped going for a run and taking charge of a training session on Friday with their match against Aston Villa at Anfield still more than a week away.

Mario Balotelli was among those being put through his paces on Merseyside, while his 41-year-old gaffer had a well-earned rest in the background.

Balotelli was absent from the Italy side that secured their first win under new manager Antonio Conte, beating Holland 2-0 with a third-minute strike from Ciro Immobile and a Daniele De Rossi penalty.

Rodgers will be glad his new striker was kept out of harm's way, though, as Liverpool look to nab their third win of the still-young Premier League season.

Balotelli was handed a place in the starting XI alongside Daniel Sturridge up front in the comfortable 3-0 win over Tottenham at White Hart Lane last Sunday.

And he will look to keep his spot and supplement Sturridge and Raheem Sterling in Liverpool's attack.
