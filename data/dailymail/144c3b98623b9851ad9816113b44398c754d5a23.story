A mother's photographs of her five-year-old daughter have become an incredibly touching portrayal of her child's journey through cancer treatment.

Zofeya Dorgu, from Dunstable, Bedfordshire, was diagnosed with medulloblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, last July, and her mother has been charting her progress through treatment with photographs in a blog.

A professional photographer, Noemi Dorgu made the brave decision to catalogue her daughter's experience of treatment as a way making sense of the shattering news, turning what was originally a way to keep friends and family informed into a lifeline for herself and others.

Noemi decided to record her experience of Zofeya's treatment through daily photographs and a blog

Zofeya has begun to show an interest in her mother's photography, and Noemi feels they help her make sense of what has happened

Zofeya's symptoms were mainly a loss of balance, and the family never dreamed she could have a brain tumour

Zofeya underwent surgery 10 days after diagnosis to remove the tumour, and has been undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy

'It started as a way to keep everyone updated at the beginning. Everyone texts, and of course they mean well, but you don't know how to reply, so we started a site to keep people up-to-date.

'But then it became a way of helping me work things out, to make sense of the situation.

‘You find yourself catapulted into this whole new world where even the terminology is alien. You have no control, you feel powerless.

'Being in the hospital all day with Zofeya, writing the blog was the only time I could sit alone and reflect on the day and what was happening in our lives.'

Zofeya has had several rounds of chemotherapy, and is due to continue until September this year

Noemi says she takes the photographs because 'there are some things you just can't put into words'

Zofeya, Noemi, her husband Matthew Dorgu and their son Malacai, eight, have been provided with emotional and practical support from CLIC Sargent Social Worker Rachel Hall

Noemi says that she hopes one day the photos will help Zofeya understand the decisions they made for her

She added: 'I decided to be really honest in it. We are such a normal family that this happened to. If Zofeya or I have a bad day, I write about it.'

A professional photographer who has now given up work to be Zofeya’s full-time carer, Noemi began to accompany the blog with pictures of Zofeya through treatment.

‘With the photos, for me, there are some things you just can’t put into words.

‘Some were hard to take, seeing your own child like that, especially after the operation when she was so very sick.

‘But the response has been amazing. It has shown me that when things get tough people show their very best side. It has really restored my faith in humanity.

'The support we have received from friends, family and strangers has been incredible.

'If our story helps anyone else in a similar situation, especially at the beginning, I’ll be overjoyed,' Noemi said.

Zofeya
 was diagnosed with medulloblastoma in July 2013, when she was four, 
after her parents noticed she was becoming clumsy, tripping over and 
bumping into things.

They took her for a check-up with her GP and booked 
her in for eyesight tests, presuming her problems stemmed from 
poor vision. 

It didn't
 occur to her parents that she may have a brain tumour as she showed no 
other symptoms; she suffered her first headache only the day before 
diagnosis.

A
 scan revealed a walnut-sized tumour in Zofeya’s brain and she was taken
 straight to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, a specialist unit for 
child oncology.

She underwent surgery 10 days later to remove the tumour, and has been undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy since.

So far she’s had several rounds of chemotherapy, which is due to continue until September this year.

Before
 her treatment, Zofeya had beautiful dark curly hair, which all began to 
fall out when she started her chemo.

So, in effort to support and normalise what her daughter was going through, Noemi decided to shave off her own hair; she 
didn’t think it fair she should have long hair when her 
daughter couldn’t.

Noemi says the support of friends, family, and strangers to the blog has been overwhelming

Zofeya is used to her mother, a passionate photographer, taking pictures of her

Noemi said that as her treatment continues, Zofeya has become more interested in her mother’s photography.

‘I became a professional photographer just weeks before Zofeya was diagnosed, but I've always loved photography and have taken loads of pictures, so she was very used to it.

‘At first I was careful not to show her any pictures from when she was really sick, but now she shows an interest in them.

‘They seem to help her make sense of what has happened to her. She sits and looks at one and will say “remember when that or this happened to me”.

‘I hope one day these pictures will help her understand the decisions we had to make as her parents about her treatment.'

Zofeya, who turned five last Saturday and spent the day with her family - which Noemi documented on her blog - has responded well to treatment, though she remains on the journey to recovery.

Zofeya, Noemi, her husband Matthew Dorgu and their son Malacai, eight, who live in Dunstable, in Bedfordshire, have been provided with emotional and practical support from CLIC Sargent Social Worker Rachel Hall who offers them advice and information on treatment.

Zofeya is responding well to treatment, but still has a way to go on her journey to recovery

Noemi said: 'Rachel came to us really early on and she was just there whenever we needed her, when we needed answers. She gave us advice about the medical processes and practical help and financial advice as well.

'Everything’s a bit overwhelming, and we were feeling overloaded with information which we didn’t fully understand; she was great at explaining things to us and letting us know how the whole process worked and what to expect.

‘The information that CLIC Sargent provided to us was brilliant. There’s a leaflet called Mary Has a Brain Tumour which we read to Malacai so he could understand what was happening to his sister.

'It’s a story about a little girl who has a brain tumour, and who’s going through the same thing as Zofeya, so it’s also been fantastic for helping her understand what’s happening as well.'
