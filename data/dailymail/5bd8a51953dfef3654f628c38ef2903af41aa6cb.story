A mother-of-two says she owes her life to her partner nagging her about seeing a doctor.

Claire Norman, 41, was diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer after her partner, Francis, 51, nagged her repeatedly to see her GP.

Ms Norman, from Plymouth, believes she would not be here now if it had not been for him.

Claire Norman, 41, was diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer after her partner, Francis, nagged her to see her GP when her nipple became inverted

She told MailOnline: ‘If I hadn’t gone to that appointment I wouldn’t be here now.

‘I nag all the time, about everything, but Francis never nags – it was out of character.’

‘I wouldn’t have gone to the GP for a while and by then I would have been very poorly. I really believe he saved my life.’

In April 2011 Ms Norman, a funeral arranger, noticed her right nipple had become inverted.

She said: ‘I wasn’t too worried. I didn’t think it would be cancer – I didn’t think it would happen to me at that age. I was only 38.’

While Ms Norman wasn't too concerned, Francis felt differently and for three weeks he nagged her to go to the doctor.

She said: ‘He wanted me to get it checked out for the sake of peace of mind.

Ms Norman (pictured before her illness) says that she was not particularly worried about the changes to her breast so she would not have gone to the doctor straight away

‘I told him to stop going on about it but eventually I went for an easy life.’

Ms Norman’s GP examined her and found a lump under her nipple.

She referred her to Derriford Hospital, in Plymouth, where she had a mammogram and a biopsy before being diagnosed with ER positive breast cancer and being found to have a large tumour.

Ms Norman, who has two daughters – Jodie, 18, and Nicole, 16 - said: ‘I was devastated when I was diagnosed.

Ms Norman (pictured with her daughters, Jodie, right, and Nicole, left) had to have nine months of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy after she was diagnosed with breast cancer

‘I was worried about losing my hair as it was really long.’

She had a mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy during nine months of intensive treatment.

She said: ‘It was horrible. It was really horrible. I caught lots of infections and spent time in and out of hospital.

‘When I was diagnosed I was worried about telling my daughters and about the impact it would have on them.’

She added: ‘I was happy Francis had made me go to the doctor. Neither of us expected that to be the result. Even when I was told, it didn’t sink in.

Ms Norman finished her treatment in January 2012 and had reconstructive surgery in October 2012.

Before she was diagnosed, Ms Norman and Francis had become engaged and they are now planning to get married next year.

She explained that since she has had her reconstructive surgery she feels confident enough to enjoy choosing a wedding dress.

Ms Norman has just had her second post-treatment check-up and was told there are currently no signs of cancer in her body.

She will have to continue going for check-ups for another five years.

She said: ‘I am looking forward to moving on now. It feels like the chapter is closed.’

She added: ‘If I had to give one piece of advice to other women it would be – if in doubt, get it checked out.

‘Don’t ever feel you are wasting the doctor’s time – it could save your life.’

Ms Norman is concerned about the risk of her daughter’s developing breast cancer, especially as her mother also suffered from the disease.

However, Jodie has decided she currently does not want to undergo genetic testing and Nicole is too young.

Ms Norman says she understands the reasons behind Jodie’s decision and that she gets some peace of mind from knowing her daughters will be screened for the disease from an early age because of their family history.

Breast Cancer Campaign has released a report called Help Us Find The Cures which explains how the charity’s research will help people like Claire living with a family history of breast cancer.

The report is supported by Asda’s Tickled Pink campaign, which raises money for Breast Cancer Campaign and Breast Cancer Care.
