Witchmarks carved into a room in a historic house in preparation for a visit by King James I have been discovered by archaeologists.

The superstitious carvings were made in the 17th century to protect the monarch from evil spirits and demons, which were thought to be rife following the Gunpowder Plot.

The marks have been hidden for centuries in Knole House in Kent, and have only come to light as part of the National Trust’s work to conserve the building, which is one of Britain’s most important historic properties.

The witchmarks are scratched into beams and joists below the floorboards and fireplace surrounds in the Upper King’s Room of the palatial house. They comprise a collection of lines that act as a net to catch demons.

Archaeologists from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola) dated the marks to early 1606 and the reign of King James I.

A few months before the marks were engraved, the infamous Gunpowder Plot of 1605 had caused mass hysteria to sweep across the county and accusations of demonic forces and witches at work were rife.

Experts believe that craftsmen working for then owner of Knole, Thomas Sackville, carved the marks in anticipation of a visit from King James I with the intention of protecting him from evil spirits.

The witchmarks were carved in the wake of the Gunpowder Plot in a bid to protect King James I from evil spirits and demons.

Also known as apotropaic marks, the carved intersecting lines and symbols found in the Upper King’s Room were thought to form a ‘demon trap’ warding off evil spirits and preventing demonic possessions.

Apotropaic magic is a type of magic intended to 'turn away' harm and evil influences. The symbol fo the evil eye is an example.

It is often practiced out of vague superstition or out of tradition.

Also known as apotropaic marks, the carved intersecting lines and symbols found in the Upper King’s Room were thought to form a ‘demon trap’ warding off evil spirits and preventing demonic possessions.

‘King James I had a keen interest in witchcraft and passed a witchcraft law, making it an offence punishable by death and even wrote a book on the topic entitled Daemonologie,’ James Wright, a Mola buildings archaeologist explained.

‘These marks illustrate how fear governed the everyday lives of people living through the tumultuous years of the early 17th century.

‘To have precisely dated these apotropaic marks so closely to the time of the Gunpowder Plot, with the anticipated visit from the King, makes this a rare if not unique discovery.

‘Using archaeology to better understand the latent fears of the common man that were heightened by the Plot is extremely exciting and adds huge significance to our research about Knole and what was happening at that time,’ he added.

Nathalie Cohen, National Trust archaeologist, said: ‘It’s wonderful to be able to piece together the forgotten stories of those who lived and worked at Knole and to share them with our visitors.

‘This is that once-in-a-lifetime chance to unravel the history of one of the largest houses in the country, from the rafters to the floorboards.’

Investigative work to learn more about the building and its past inhabitants will continue throughout the house until 2018.

A series of behind the scenes tours are available on November 20 and 21 so that visitors can discover the witchmarks for themselves. 

People lived in fear of a Catholic rebellion and ghoulish goings on in the aftermath of Guy Fawkes' Gunpowder Plot.

King James I had a reputation as an avid witch hunter and wrote a book called Demonology.

Professor Ronald Hutton of the University of Bristol, told the BBC: 'It was a mandate for the British to fight witches.'

People mused witchmarks and relied on other superstitions to protect them at the tumultuous time.

In his book, James l wrote: 'Children, women and liars can be witnesses over high treason against God,' and this influenced the justice system when dealing with people accused of witchcraft.

A nine-year-old beggar called Jennet Device helped convict 10 people of witchcraft in the 1612 Pendle witch trial in Lancashire, which led to their execution.

She even denounced her mother as a witch, who had hosted a party on Good Friday when she should have been in Church. Her sister was accused of killing a pedlar after she cursed him and he collapsed.

As a result of a family feud, most of the family were found guilty of causing death or harm by witchcraft and were hanged at Gallows Hill.

The influence of the ambitious local magistrate, Roger Nowell, who passed the sentence, extended as far as the US, after the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, penned a best seller about the case, which was used as a reference handbook for magistrates.

The book suggested seeking the testimony of children in trials of witchcraft, and at the notorious Salem witch trials in 1692, most of the evidence was given by children, leading to 19 people being hanged.
