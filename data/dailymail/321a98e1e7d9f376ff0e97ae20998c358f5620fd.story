Air travel was once the last bastion of uncontactability in an increasingly connected world.

But plane passengers are now embracing in-flight mobile phone technology more than ever before, according to new statistics.

AeroMobile – the first mobile service ever to operate on a commercial flight – has revealed that more than 19 million passengers have successfully connected to the AeroMobile network since the service was introduced in 2008.

In those six years, more than 22 million text messages have been made and received on the AeroMobile network.

The facility is now used on 260 aircraft across 13 airlines, meaning the service is available on more than 500 flights everyday. 

Figures are expected to rise heavily in the coming months with holidaymakers increasingly wanting to stay connected to friends and family while flying at 30,000ft.

The AeroMobile service also allows passengers to send and upload messages and pictures to their social network accounts such as Twitter and Instagram, while travellers are now also able to send emails and post Whatsapp messages.

‘Many people don’t know that they can use their phones to send texts, make calls and connect to the internet inflight,’ said Kevin Rogers, CEO of AeroMobile.

‘The AeroMobile service allows passengers to use their phone inflight with the same level of connectivity they experience on the ground.

‘Inflight mobile usage is becoming more and more popular – we are working with many airline partners including BA, Virgin Atlantic, Aer Lingus, Emirates, Lufthansa and Etihad – and more passengers than ever are using their mobile phones inflight,’ Rogers continued.

In July 2014 the AeroMobile network was on-board more than 13,000 flights and available to 4.6 million passengers.

The company say that a total of more than 500,000 MB of data has been transferred by passengers using its service since March 2008 – a huge amount when considering that an hour of video chatting on FaceTime uses 204MB.

Passengers using flights where the AeroMobile facility is available are automatically be connected to the network if they turn their phone on during the flight.

Charges appear on mobile phone bills, just as they would when roaming abroad, so passengers are not required to on-board payments.

Receiving a text message is free of charge.

The 13 airlines currently offering inflight connectivity through AeroMobile are Emirates, Etihad Airways, KLM, Air France, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways, Transaero, SAS, Singapore Airlines, EVA Air, Virgin Atlantic, British Airways and Aer Lingus, as well as VIP Carriers Comlux, Dubai Air Wing and Presidential Flight.

The AeroMobile service also allows passengers to send and upload messages and pictures to their social network accounts such as Twitter and Instagram, while travellers are now also able to send emails

It was in 2008 that mobile phones were first able to be used, with the system being unveiled on a flight from Dubai to London Heathrow.

The Emirates Boeing 777 was equipped with the AeroMobile system, with one in five passengers on-board taking advantage of the facility.

Costs are typically about £1.50 a minute.

Phone calls in the air had previously been banned because of the fear that mobiles trying to connect with masts on the ground can interfere with the plane's controls.

But the AeroMobile system used by planes lets phones connect to a minimast on the aircraft.

Budget airline Ryanair trialled a similar service in 2009, but scrapped it later that year.
