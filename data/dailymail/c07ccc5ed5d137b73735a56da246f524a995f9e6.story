A UN adviser today compared the eviction of residents at Europe's largest illegal travellers' site to the plight of millions in Zimbabwe as he accused a council of  'violating international law'.

In an extraordinary visit to Dale Farm, in Essex, Professor Yves Cabannes claimed Basildon Council had broken human rights legislation in three ways.

Speaking outside one of the traveller's homes, with the UN flag hoisted behind him, the UN adviser for forced evictions also drew parallels with China and Nigeria - both notorious for human rights abuses.

He
also said that it was the council, not the Dale Farm residents, who 
were 'abusing the law', despite the presence of 400 people on illegal 
plots at the site.

Those 
living at the site illegally are due to be evicted from Monday, but 
despite claims this will leave them homeless it was revealed today that 
one of the Dale Farm travellers is masterminding a multi-million-pound 
property development in Ireland.

Professor Cabannes said: 'A study which I led on forced eviction found that at Dale Farm, and the UK in general, the Government is violating international human rights law on three points.

'These are the right to adequate housing, the right to be defended from forced eviction and discrimination.'

Prof Cabannes argued that Basildon Council had failed to provide the pitches it should make available to travellers.

He added: 'The people who are abusing the law are the council, not the travellers. The council is not fulfilling its duties.

'There are many Dale Farms which face these issues every day and there needs to be a co-ordinated approach across the country.

'We
are used to see millions of people losing their homes in Zimbabwe, 
China and Nigeria - how is one country unable to solve the problem of 51
pitches?'

His visit came as there were signs of travellers beginning to leave the site voluntarily. At least five caravans are believed to have left last night.

The eviction is due to start on Monday and follows a decade-long row over illegal plots.

Prepared: A large police operation is planned for the eviction on Monday to ensure it passes off peacefully

Moving on: Reports have emerged that several Dale Farm families have already started to leave the site

Although half of the site is legal, an estimated 400 people are said to be living on 51 unauthorised plots.

Travellers and supporters say they will resist the eviction peacefully but police are preparing a major operation to ensure the Basildon Council-led operation passes off peacefully.

Council leader Tony Ball said: 'For 
10 years we have sought a peaceful and humanitarian solution to Dale 
Farm, but it must be one that involves upholding the law of our country.

'The
current site has been illegally developed. After 10 years, when we have
exhausted the judicial process and every effort to negotiate, we have 
no option but to resort to direct action to clear the site.

'The
travellers can find a culturally appropriate answer to their housing 
problem but it must involve a site with the proper planning permission.

'The
UN "representative" may not be aware that Basildon provides more 
approved traveller sites than any other local authority area in Essex 
and among the greatest number on any area in the country. We have a very
strong record of working with travellers within the law.

'The
UN refers to the rights of the families involved. Basildon Council 
respects those along with the rights of the vast majority of its 
residents who want this illegal camp moved after 10 years of stalling 
tactics by the travellers.'

Protest: A traveller family demonstrates against the eviction during Prof Chabannes' visit to Dale Farm

A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: 'The British courts have found that the developments at Dale Farm are in breach of planning law and Basildon District Council is within its rights to evict travellers from the site.

'It has taken 10 years of failed negotiations and legal process to reach this point, and the unprecedented level of unauthorised development on green belt land has severely damaged community relations.'

Prof
Cabannes' accusation comes on the day when it was revealed that a Dale 
Farm traveller controls a large development in Ireland.

Planning records show that Michael Quilligan, the son of a traveller worth £24million,
is the mastermind behind a multi-million-pound development in the town 
of Rathkeale, the spiritual home of travellers in the west of Ireland.

The
large detached and semi-detached houses - worth up to £400,000 - are 
close to completion and are near to the local equivalent of 
millionaires' row, where other substantial gated properties can be 
found.

Defiant: Travellers living at the Dale Farm site in Essex have vowed to remain there

Mr Quilligan is thought to have sold some of the properties to other travellers.

It
is unclear whether Dale Farm residents are among the buyers but one 
local report yesterday claimed that a dozen of the families facing 
eviction have bought homes in Rathkeale.

Members of Basildon Council, which is responsible for clearing the Dale Farm site, are calling for an urgent investigation.

This latest twist in the saga blows apart the travellers’ claims that there is nowhere ‘culturally sensitive’ for them to go if they are evicted.

Their links with Rathkeale – where around half of the town’s properties are owned by travellers – suggest they have a perfect retreat in their native land.

Evictions: The 10-year battle to remain at Dale Farm was lost earlier this month

It also emerged yesterday that Basildon Borough Council had paid housing benefits for some of the Dale Farm travellers directly to a landlord based in Rathkeale.

John Flynn, 55, bought the former scrapyard at Dale Farm for £120,000 ten years ago and owns about five caravan pitches on the site.

The council admitted it paid money directly to Mr Flynn at an address in Rathkeale to cover the rent of his tenants, who were allowed to claim housing benefits, despite living on an illegal site.

Many of the homes in Rathkeale remain boarded up apart from a few months a year and at Christmas when a cavalcade of UK-registered Range Rovers, Mercedes, BMWs and Porsches roll into the town, pulling caravans behind them.

Extravagant traveller weddings and christenings in the local Roman Catholic church add to the carnival atmosphere over the Christmas period.

Time to move: The illegal site at Dale Farm covers 51 plots and houses around 400 people

Mr Quilligan, a father of four, runs a business called Michael Quilligan Building Contractor and is the son of Rathkeale’s wealthiest traveller, Simon ‘Sammy Buckshot’ Quilligan, an antiques dealer.

John Dornan, a Tory councillor in Essex, said: ‘I have long called for an inquiry into the funding of the site.

‘This new information needs to be looked at by the council to compare it with any homeless applications and housing benefits claims.

‘I do not want to prejudice any investigation, but if any of the same people are involved, it would have huge implications.’

Dale Farm, built on green belt land near Basildon, came to the attention of planners around ten years ago when illegal plots started springing up around a smaller approved site.

Since then it has grown into a 400-strong community of travellers who have built roads and connections to electricity.

Bailiffs and police are planning to start removing travellers on the illegal camp from Monday after the council won a High Court battle to evict them.

The travellers and supporters 
revealed today they have collected a 7,000-strong petition supporting calls to
halt the eviction until suitable alternatives are explored in full.

They also presented a letter from Sir 
Richard Jolly, a former UN official, expressing concerns that the 
clearance may contravene the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Campaigner Grattan Puxon said: 'It is not to late for us to stop this. We have three planning applications lodged and will be returning to the High Court tomorrow to try to stop the eviction.'
