This is the moment a Florida police officer was left seriously injured after being struck down in a hit-and-run - only for his teenage daughter to pull over to help and discover the victim was her father.

Sergeant Kerstan Tatro, of Gulf Breeze Police Department, was captured on video pulling over Amy Giorgio, 30, after allegedly spotting her speeding near the south end of the Pensacola Bay Bridge.

But as he leaned through the window to speak to her, she suddenly restarted her car engine and accelerated, dragging him along the road, footage shows. He was then thrown off the vehicle.

While Giorgio reportedly sped off, Mr Tatro's 16-year-old daughter Faith - who happened to be driving by at the time after visiting Cordova Mall - stopped to help the fallen officer.

Speaking to the Pensacola News Journal, Faith said: 'I didn't know what happened. I saw the other car speed off and him on the ground. When I saw him, I freaked out, and I just started crying.'

Her father, who suffered a serious arm injury and a wounded foot, added: 'She was screaming, 'My dad, that's my dad''... This was killing her and she shouldn't have had to witness that.'

The shocking video, which was captured via Mr Tatro's dashcam, shows him approaching Giorgio after allegedly noticing her driving erratically at 65mph in a 30mph zone, Fox 10 reported.

He then asks the driver to step out of her car for a sobriety test. But instead of exiting the vehicle, Giorgio apparently starts her engine, puts the car in gear and hits the accelerator.

Mr Tatro, who has five children and a wife, Natalie, can be heard yelling: 'Don't f***ing do this' as he is dragged alongside Giorgio's car for several feet, before being thrown off to the side of the road.

As he writhes on the ground in pain, multiple bystanders can be seen rushing to help the injured officer, whose foot was reportedly run over by Giorgio in the incident. 

Then, his daughter, Faith, suddenly jumps out of a red car and dashes over to help. 

Speaking from his hospital bed, Mr Tatro said: 'I was thinking, what is she doing here?' You go to work every night and they say be careful, and I say, 'I promise. I'll be careful, I'll be home'.
