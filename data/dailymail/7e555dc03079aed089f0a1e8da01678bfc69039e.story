The water level in a key Southern California aquifer has hit a historic low as drought continues to ravage the state - leaving local leaders scrambling for ways to convince Californians to cut back on their water use.

The San Bernardino Basin is down by more than 163billion gallons - about 500,000 acre-feet, from its maximum level, Douglas Headrick, the manager for the San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District, told the Los Angeles Times.

It's the lowest level ever recorded - lower than the previous record set in 1964, which came after 20 years of drought.

Diamond Valley Lake, the giant regional reservoir in Riverside County, has been dramatically drained by the massive drought that is afflicting nearly all of California

The aquifer is a key source of water for much of the Inland Empire, a sprawling metropolitan region with 4.2million people.

'This isnâ€™t just an issue for San Bernardino, but many other cities depend on this basin for much of their water supply, including Redlands, Highland, Loma Linda, Rialto, Colton and Riverside,' water resource manager Bob Tincher told the Times.

Exacerbating the problem is that communities that normally sell the Inland Empire excess water are cutting back deliveries as they are squeezed by drought, as well.

Despite the crisis - more than 80percent of California is in extreme drought and more than a third of the state is experiencing expectational drought' (the worst classification) - many Californians don't seem to be terribly conscious of where their water comes from.

More than 80percent of California is in extreme drought and more than a third is suffering 'exceptional drought' - the worst classification

A new survey shows that less than five percent of residents of the Inland Empire know that nearly a third of the water they consume is imported from other areas.

Earlier this month, officials were shocked to find that after announcing water conservation measures, many Southern California areas reported an increase in water usage.

In the nearby Temacula Valley in Riverside County, officials announced they could begin to limit the amount of water being pumped out of the aquifer there over concern that it could be sucked so dry that it would never recover when the rains finally return.
