David Cameron last night pledged to scrap ‘once and for all’ Labour’s controversial Human Rights Act – and replace it with a British Bill of Rights.

The Prime Minister launched a scathing attack on European human rights judges and defended the right of Parliament to make its own laws.

He said the country that wrote Magna Carta did not need to take human rights lessons from judges in Strasbourg. The policy is a repeat of the commitment made in the 2010 manifesto – which was then scrapped during coalition negotiations with the Liberal Democrats.

More details of human rights reforms are expected to follow in the coming days – including giving more sway to the British Supreme Court.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is also considering a so-called ‘Parliamentary override’ which would allow MPs to veto contentious Strasbourg rulings, such as those on giving prisoners the vote.

Mr Cameron also insisted he would secure greater powers over immigration from within the European Union.

The Government had succeeded in capping non-EU migrant numbers, he said, but admitted the ‘bigger issue today’ is EU migrants and their ‘immediate access to our welfare system’.

More power: Mr Cameron told his audience he would get 'what Britain needs' and would 'not take no for an answer', pointing to success in cutting the European Budget and pulling out of EU bailout schemes

He said: ‘Britain, I know you want this sorted so I will go to Brussels, I will not take no for an answer and, when it comes to free movement, I will get what Britain needs.

‘Anyone who thinks I can’t or won’t deliver this – judge me by my record,’ he said, pointing to success in cutting the European Budget and pulling out of EU bailout schemes.

There was a murmur of agreement from Tory supporters in the Birmingham Symphony Hall when Mr Cameron said it was ‘not just the EU that needs sorting out – it’s the European Court of Human Rights.’

Praise: Mr Cameron praised Home Secretary Theresa May for capping migrant numbers from outside the EU and shutting down 700 bogus colleges 'that were basically visa factories'

He condemned human rights rulings that blocked the deportation of terror suspects and applied even on battlefields.

He said: ‘This is the country that wrote Magna Carta, the country that time and again has stood up for human rights, whether liberating Europe from fascism or leading the charge today against sexual violence in war.

‘We do not require instruction on this from judges in Strasbourg. So with a Conservative Government after the election, this country will have a new British Bill of Rights, passed in our Parliament, rooted in our values. And as for Labour’s Human Rights Act? We will scrap it, once and for all.’

Mr Cameron praised Home Secretary Theresa May for capping migrant numbers from outside the EU and shutting down 700 bogus colleges ‘that were basically visa factories’.

÷ In the biggest group action to date, more than 1,000 UK prisoners – including 74 serving life – are to go to the ECHR to demand compensation for being barred from voting.
