West Ham have been fined £30,000 by the Football Association for failing to control their players in the recent draw at Southampton.

The incident in question occurred after referee Craig Pawson sent off Hammers goalkeeper Adrian just after the hour mark for handling the ball outside of his penalty area.

Although the Spaniard's red card was later overturned on appeal, the FA has announced the club have been punished for the players' reaction.

'Following an independent regulatory commission hearing, West Ham United have been fined £30,000 after the club admitted an FA charge of failing to ensure its players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion,' a statement on the FA's official website read.

'The charge was in relation to an incident which occurred in or around the 61st minute of the game against Southampton on 11 February 2015.'

Adrian's dismissal saw West Ham play with 10 men for the remaining half an hour at St Mary's - with Sam Allardyce's side able to hold on for a 0-0 stalemate.

Allardyce confirmed immediately after the game that they would appeal the red card and, whilst that proved to be successful, the club have now been hit with a fine for the separate charge.

It is the second time this season the Hammers have been punished for failure to control their players following an incident in a 2-1 defeat at Everton which saw both clubs handed the same charge.

With a derby against local rivals Tottenham on Sunday, West Ham co-chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold have issued a letter to fans asking for their behaviour to remain exemplary at White Hart Lane.

Previous matches between the two sides have been tarnished by anti-Semitic chants from a minority of West Ham supporters, with Gold and Sullivan calling for travelling fans to be at their best this weekend.

West Ham players show their disbelief at the red card decision which consequently cost the club £30,000

'Sam and the team have been working hard on the training pitch this week to put last week's wrongs right and Sunday's game offers an exciting opportunity for us to bounce back (from defeat at West Brom),' they said in a statement on West Ham's website.

'We would also like to remind all fans attending the match at White Hart Lane that they will be acting as ambassadors for West Ham United and their behaviour should reflect the values and standards of our club.

'Working with the Metropolitan Police, the Club will continue to adopt a zero tolerance policy towards any form of discriminatory behaviour and any fan found to be acting inappropriately - including racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic behaviour - will be punished to the full extent of the law and banned from attending matches.

'We are rightly proud of our world-famous support home and away and we look forward to the famous 'claret and blue army' once again getting behind the team with all their heart and showing the world that following the Hammers means supporting with pride, passion and respect.'

Sam Allardyce and his side will be hoping that the fans will be on their best behaviour against Tottenham
