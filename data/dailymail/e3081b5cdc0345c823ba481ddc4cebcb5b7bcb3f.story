It captured the imagination of a generation of children.

And for decades, there were fears it might have been lost forever after falling into unscrupulous hands.

Now those who searched for the elusive golden hare from the 1970s Masquerade mystery will finally be able to see it up close – when it goes on public display for the very first time.

The amulet, created by artist Kit Williams, is to be shown at the Victoria and Albert museum as part of a new design exhibition.

Mystery: Those who searched for the elusive golden hare from the 1970s Masquerade mystery will finally be able to see it up close - when it goes on public display for the very first time

Popular: Williams's children's story Masquerade was a publishing sensation, selling almost a million copies when it appeared in 1979

He sparked a nationwide treasure hunt when he buried the jewel three decades ago – with clues as to its whereabouts published in a children’s storybook.

But to the disappointment of hundreds of thousands of enthusiasts, the amulet was eventually unearthed by a fraudster who cheated his way into the discovery.

Even more alarmingly, it was then sold off to a mystery buyer in the Far East – and lost for 20 years.

But in an extraordinary twist of fate, the current owner came forward in 2009 after learning of its significance to the UK and has now put it on temporary loan to the museum.

In a rare interview, its publicity-shy creator said he was glad his fans would finally have the chance to see it.

Williams said: ‘The idea was to bury 
something in the cold wet earth. It was the romance of it, that whatever
 people were doing, that jewel was waiting for them.

‘It
 hasn’t been seen by the British public before, as it was taken out of 
the ground by a rather dubious man who didn’t want to show it.

‘The
 amulet looks the same as when I made it, although some of the green 
stones have turned black after being preserved in wax while underground.

‘The current owner is very nice, I have met her and I’m glad she’s got it. She didn’t realise it had this other life.

‘She’s delighted that it’s going on display in Britain.’

Williams’s children’s story Masquerade was a publishing sensation, selling almost a million copies when it appeared in 1979.

Among the illustrations and story, he inserted clues to locate a golden hare amulet – which he buried in a field himself.

But though two physics teachers cracked the puzzle in 1982, they were beaten to the treasure by another searcher.

This man, who has never been identified, appeared to have found the hiding place through his connection with Williams’ girlfriend.

She had known of the rough position in Ampthill Park, Bedfordshire, and the exact spot was narrowed down using metal detectors.

The hare was eventually auctioned in December 1988, and sold for £31,900 to an unknown buyer. Williams had hoped to buy it back but dropped out of the bidding at £6,000.

Sotheby’s contacted Williams to verify the authenticity since the stones appeared to be a different colour -  but the auctioneer was unable to tell him who the eventual buyer was.

The current owner came forward by chance in 2009 after her grandaughter happened to be in London and hear about it on the radio.

The woman, who lives in the far east, prefers to be anonymous because she holds an ‘important position’ in her country – but was moved to hear of the story of Masquerade and wanted to get involved.

Williams added: ‘It’s become a family heirloom. A member of her family wears it to Christmas dinner every year.

‘I
 don’t know what will happen to it, but my hopes are irrelevant. It’s 
like a child, it’s grown up and its got its own life now.

‘I’m
 glad that I created Masquerade, but I wouldn’t do it again. I wasn’t 
prepared for how big it would get. I had people knocking on my door in 
the middle of the night asking for clues.’

The
 jewel is to form part of an exhibition of the best British designs of 
the 20th and 21st centuries at the Victoria and Albert Museum starting 
on Saturday March 31.

Ghislaine
 Wood, who curated the exhibition, said: ‘Visitors who owned the book, 
or who remember the excitement it generated at the time, will be 
thrilled to see the hare.

‘This
 is the first time it has been on public display since it was found, and
 hopefully it will evoke strong memories for many. A new generation of 
visitors may also be inspired to go back and discover the book for 
themselves.’

Williams, now 65, lives in Gloucestershire with his wife, Eleyne, and paints for a living.
