With the tax return deadline looming, many Americans are scrambling to ensure that everything is in order.

With the economic situation still precarious, tax collectors are looking for ever more weird and wonderful ways to raise revenue.

Such is the diversity of products and lifestyles across the 50 states that federal financial planners are hoping to take advantage of the specific portfolio of products on offer in their area.

Below is a list of some of the more interesting and inventive solutions federal leaders have come up with to try and balance the books.

Drug tax: In many U.S. states anyone possessing cannabis or other illegal drugs is legally obliged to buy and affix state-issued stamps onto the contraband material

The Marijuana Tax

In many U.S. states anyone possessing cannabis is legally obliged to buy and affix state-issued stamps onto the contraband material.

The total cost of the tax is generally determined by the quantity of the marijuana possessed.

Unlike typical criminal statutes prohibiting the possession and sale of controlled substances, drug tax stamp laws primarily assess financial penalties on the offender for noncompliance.

The Blueberry Tax:  Maine produces all but 1 percent of the wild blueberries sold nationally.

Anyone growing, handling, processing, selling or
 purchasing blueberries pays a tax of a penny-and-a-half per pound.

Berry taxing: Anyone growing, handling, processing, selling or purchasing blueberries in Maine pays a tax of a penny-and-a-half per pound

Jock Tax:Many cities and states levy a 'jock tax' on any income earned by entertainers and athletes while working in that city. Therefore, athletes have to pay taxes on a portion of their income in any place they play.

Tax prize money: Many cities and states levy a 'jock tax' on any income 
earned by entertainers and athletes, such as Tiger Woods, while working 
in that city

Nudity:Â  Those responsible for raising funds in Utah levy a tax on
 services provided by those who make their money in the non-clothed manner.

Any business employing 'nude or partially nude' workers, must pay a
 tax of 10 percent on services sold to patrons.

Naked truth: Any business employing 'nude or partially nude' workers in Utah must pay a tax of 10 percent on services sold to patrons

Fur: Minnesota, imposes a tax of 
6.5 percent on the sale of fur apparel.

A garment must contain at least three times as much fur as 
it does of the next-most-valuable material that went into its creation.

The same tax applies to the shipping of fur items and to 
any finance charges that may have been incurred.

Tattoos: Arkansas taxes tattoos at a rate of 6 percent for every sale, and it also applies the same tax to body piercings and 
electrolysis, so getting a tattoo, body piercing and some electrolysis will set you back a tidy sum.

Tatt's a lot: If David Beckham (pictured) lived in Arkansas he would 
have had to pay 6 percent to get this tattoo of his wife Victoria

Pets:  In Durham, North Carolina, anyone who
 owns a cat or dog must pay tax, since the state considers pets to be 
personal property no different from, a computer or a bike. However the tax is less for spayed or neutered pets at a rate of only $10 per animal.

But for pets who still have their vital reproducing equipment, it is $75. This 
is in contrast to New York's bagel tax, where an eight per cent 
charge is added to bagels that have been 'altered' but not to ones which have been uncut.

Pet power: In North Carolina the tax is less for spayed or neutered pets. Pictured, Yoda who took part in the World's Ugliest Dog Contest in California last year

Balloon Rides: Kansas distinguishes between 
tethered balloons and balloons set free.

Unattached balloons are considered a form of air transportation to take a ride in whereas a balloon which is still connected to the ground is considered a form of amusement and taxed accordingly.
