Tottenham have rejected Brentford’s attempt to turn Alex Pritchard’s loan deal into a permanent transfer next month.

Pritchard has impressed in the Championship this season, making a valuable contribution as Mark Warburton’s team have mounted a surprise bid for promotion.

Brentford were keen to sign the 21-year-old attacking midfielder on a permanent basis but Spurs believe he can still have a first-team future at White Hart Lane.

But Tottenham believe the experience gained from the loan will help Pritchard, 21, integrate into the first team

They have been encouraged by the development of academy players such as Andros Townsend, Harry Kane and Ryan Mason.

The trio have all made the step to the Barclays Premier League after a series of loan spells.

Kane has been a revelation this season with 14 goals and Mason, who was on loan at Swindon in League One with Pritchard last season, has proved the value of patience, by making the step into Mauricio Pochettino’s team at the age of 23.
