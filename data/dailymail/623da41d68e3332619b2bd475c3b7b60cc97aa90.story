Former Newcastle manager Graeme Souness is not surprised the pressure on current boss Alan Pardew is intensifying.

Pardew's future has become the subject of heavy speculation after a dismal start to the season.

Supporters vented their frustration as the Magpies, without a win in the Barclays Premier League, slumped to a 4-0 loss at Southampton on Saturday.

Newcastle's form prolongs a poor run which saw the side lose 14 of their last 20 league matches last season.

Souness, in charge at St James' Park from 2004-06, says Pardew will know he must deliver.

The Scot said on Pardew: 'Results are everything in football.

'If you are not winning football matches then it used to be you got half a season, or usually a season, now you get six games. If you are in a job you know that is the case.

'Newcastle are a big football club, (with a) very passionate football crowd, and a very frustrated crowd at times. They are not slow to show their emotions.

'But that is the price on the ticket of being a manager at Newcastle.

'You know that if it does go wrong your head will be on the block, and be on the block pretty quickly. That is where he finds himself, unfortunately.

'It is part of the deal. You have to deal with it. You have to be thick-skinned, you have to have the support of the people around you and you hope the players are still with you.

'If that is in place and the board are sensible, then he might get through it.'

Pardew, who took charge in 2010, signed an eight-year contract just two years ago.

Despite that, Saturday's clash with Hull is being billed as vital for Pardew's future in some quarters.

Former midfielder Lee Bowyer believes Pardew needs more time to integrate summer signings.

Bowyer said: 'We are only three or four games in and there is a very, very long way to go.

'I thought he did well last year with the squad he had and I think he will do it again this season.

'Don't judge him yet. It takes about six games to start getting into it and he has had a few players come in, so it will take time to gel.'
