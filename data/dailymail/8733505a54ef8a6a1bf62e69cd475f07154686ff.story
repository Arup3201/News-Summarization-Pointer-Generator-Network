A woman has told how she went under the knife and had her cup size enhanced after being teased over her padded underwear.

Chelsey Dunn, 26, was mortified when her partner compared her underwear to that of cross-dressing nanny Mrs Doubtfire.

She had long considered a breast augmentation and says the unflattering comparison was the final straw.

Months after the remark, she was boosted from a 34A to a 34DD at a cost of £5,500 and is now delighted to have been able to throw away her old underwear. 

Miss Dunn, who is now engaged to marry her partner after he proposed following her surgery said: ‘It was just a joke to make me laugh but I had to admit it was true.

'I wanted to be able to wear nice lingerie and backless clothes but I couldn’t because I felt out of proportion without my padded bra on.'

She underwent the operation in January last year and was boosted to a 34DD

Miss Dunn, from Rhyl, South Wales, had been teased over her lack of curves at school and was unkindly nicknamed the ‘ironing board.’

She says she longed for her bust to grow and hoped she was just a late developer, but by her early twenties she was used to concealing her bust.

She said: ‘I would buy the thickest padded bras I could find. My friends all joked that they looked like mattress padding.

'For some reason thick padded bras are always beige. They are the most unattractive garments but without them I felt self-conscious.'

Months after her operation, her boyfriend proposed in the Disney Princess Castle while the couple were holidaying in Florida and Miss Dunn accepted

It meant she was limited to clothing that she could wear to conceal the bras.

She said: ‘Holidays were tricky because I couldn’t wear my padded bra under bikinis and longed to wear strapless and backless dresses like my friends but it was impossible.

It was when she was undressing in front of her boyfriend that he teasingly asked her if Mrs Doubtfire wanted her bra back soon that she decided it was time to do something about it.

She said: 'It was really funny because I was the first to admit my padded bras were not sexy in the slightest. But it did also make me think enough was enough. My chest had always bothered me why not do something about it?’

She booked a consultation with Transform and her surgeon agreed to boost her from an A to a DD cup.

She underwent the operation in January last year and could not wait to ditch the padded bras. She said: ‘My surgeon  answered all my questions and put me at ease. I was really happy with the care and thought my new breasts looked very natural and in keeping with my frame, which is just what I asked for.’

Months later her boyfriend, delivery driver Ross Stephens, 29, proposed in the Disney Princess Castle while the couple were holidaying in Florida and Miss Dunn accepted. 

She said: ‘I would never have been able to wear a dress like it before and I cannot wait.’
