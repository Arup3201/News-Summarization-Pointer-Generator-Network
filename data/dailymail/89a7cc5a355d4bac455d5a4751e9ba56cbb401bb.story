Petrol prices could fall to £1 a litre for the first time in five years if a slump in the market continues, one of Britain's leading drivers' lobbyists has claimed.

Professor Stephen Glaister, head of the RAC Foundation, said although the 'tantalising' prospect was still distant it had been made thinkable by plunging crude oil prices.

The cost of a barrel has fallen from more than $90 a barrel six weeks ago to a three-year low of $78, prompting a new push by politicians for supermarkets to slash pump prices.

The call by Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander intensified competition between Tesco, Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s - all of which cut petrol prices by around 1p on Wednesday.

Across the country pump prices already stand at their lowest level in around four years. 

Prof Glaister told The Sunday Telegraph: 'When oil was last at $60 a barrel in spring 2009, the price of petrol stood at just under £1 a litre.

'Rising VAT and fuel duty rates need to be factored in, along with changes to the exchange rate, but a continued fall in crude prices raises the tantalising – though distant – prospect of getting change from a quid for every litre you buy.' 

Crude oil prices shot to record levels of $140 a barrel in summer 2008, months before the collapse of the bank Lehman Brothers gave the first signs of a global financial crisis.

Petrol prices have already fallen sharply in recent weeks, but ministers believe they should drop further

Just a year later oil prices dipped below $45 a barrel, prompting motorists to call on sellers to slash prices in return.

Since then oil prices have gradually risen and hovered around $100 for the last few years until they dropped below $80 a barrel again this month.

The fall in prices prompted a war of words this week between politicians - who urged petrol retailers to drop prices - and the retailers themselves, who said fuel duty should be slashed.

Asda petrol fell to 119.7p a litre and diesel to 123.7p, the first time its petrol had dipped under 120p in four years.

Shell insisted it was ‘doing its bit’ to keep pump prices low but added: 'Crude oil costs account only for about one third of the price at the pump – tax and duty on fuel account for almost two thirds.'

Brian Madderson, of the Petrol Retailers’ Association, said it had tried for weeks to discuss the issue with the Treasury adding that ‘to criticise the industry without speaking to us is grossly unfair’. 

But Mr Alexander warned: ‘When the price of oil falls, the public have a right to expect pump prices to fall like a stone, not a feather’.

Luke Bosdet of the AA said that while supermarkets were leading the price cuts, ‘fuel prices … are not moving fast enough’.
