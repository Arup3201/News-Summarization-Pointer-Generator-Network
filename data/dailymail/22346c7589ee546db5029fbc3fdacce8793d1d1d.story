A Gary Glitter fan has been condemned by child abuse campaigners for selling 2015 calendars signed by the paedophile singer.

Claire Shephard, who is selling 45 of the 'limited edition' calendars on Facebook for £20 each, had five of them signed by the shamed rocker.

Child protection groups have slammed the 'distasteful' memorabilia and warned the calendars could have a devastating impact on abuse survivors by triggering flashbacks.

Glitter - real name Paul Gadd - provided two exclusive photos of himself at home in his apartment for the 'through the years' calendars, which he is said to have described as 'brilliant'.

In 1999, Glitter served half of a four-month sentence in Britain for possessing 4,000 child pornography images.

He was jailed for three years in 2006, this time in Vietnam, for molesting two girls aged 10 and 11, but was released early.

The paedophile returned to Britain in August 2008 after 19 other countries refused to let him in and his music has largely been banned by radio stations.

Ms Shephard, the 50-year-old widow of Glitter Band guitarist, singer and composer Gerry Shephard, posted an advert on Facebook which said: 'GG Calendar 2015 It's Christmas!!!

'This is a limited edition run and only 45 are available. I know everyone was pleased with the one which was available two years ago so decided it was time for another.'

Five of the 45 2015 calendars were signed personally by Glitter, who was jailed in Vietnam for three years for molesting two girls aged 10 and 11

After having the calendars made, Ms Shephard, from Coleford, Gloucestershire, added:  'I was so excited I could barely dare open the package!

'I have to admit it does look super. I am sure anyone who receives one will most definitely not be disappointed.

'I already have a list of you good folk who have already contacted me reserving one.

'I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for sharing their uploaded photos (which has made this fabulous calendar possible), your continuing support of Gary and all of his related pages on Facebook (and those who work tirelessly at being the admin for them), your love and enthusiasm for the music he created and which we still enjoy just as much today as ever.'

Earlier this week she revealed to other fans of the Glitter that the convicted paedophile had given the calendars his seal of approval.

She wrote: 'I have managed to get five copies of the 2015 Calendar SIGNED!!! I should have them by the weekend.

'I was very pleased to hear that Gary thought the calendar was "brilliant".'

Child protection groups warned simply seeing pictures of Glitter could be enough to trigger painful memories for abuse victims.

Kidscape said any profits from the calendar should go to victims of sexual abuse.

'Exciting news': Ms Shephard posted an advert for the calendars on her Facebook page

Ms Shephard, the widow of Glitter Band guitarist, singer and composer Gerry Shephard, angered child abuse campaigners who said the calendar could bring back painful memories for victims

A spokesman said: 'Gary Glitter fans are of course entitled to their allegiances, but many people would question whether it is acceptable for a convicted sex offender to be enshrined in calendar form.

'Any profits from this merchandise should be directed to benefit victims of sexual abuse.

'Indeed the people behind this calendar should consider its potential impact on abuse victims. At the very least this product engenders distasteful associations.'

John Bird, operations manager for National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said the calendar was 'absolutely awful'. 

He said: 'The one thing we say is it is the truth that it important.

'When people present themselves in a rose-tinted way, it's one thing if they have been found guilty of some sort of tax fraud, but it is different for people who have sexually abused children.

'It doesn't matter what music career he ever had - it's completely irrelevant.

'If the photographs had "child abuser" written in big letters across them, I'd be happy.

'[The calendar] could put someone who has been sexually abused in a flash back. For survivors of child sexual abuse that image could put them right back in that same emotional experience, reliving it.'

Glitter is due to face 10 child sex charges involving three underage girls on January 12. 

The 70-year-old is currently on bail accused of the crimes in the 1970s and early 1980s and will appear at Southwark Crown Court.
