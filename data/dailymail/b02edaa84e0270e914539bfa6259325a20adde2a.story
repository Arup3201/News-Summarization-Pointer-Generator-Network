Francis Matthews, the voice of the iconic 1960s sci-fi hero Captain Scarlet, has died at the age of 86 following a short illness.

Anderson Entertainment, the company behind the extra-terrestrial puppet show, said it was 'sad' to announce the passing of the actor, who brought the Mysteron-battling character to life in Gerry Anderson’s production between 1967 and 1968.

Matthews’ voice for the Spectrum agent was based on the Transatlantic accent of Hollywood star Cary Grant, and became well known to generations of children thanks to countless re-runs over the years.

Matthews also became known for playing Francis Durbridge’s amateur detective, Paul Temple, in the BBC TV drama series and appeared in several Hammer Horror films.

In a statement on www.gerryanderson.co.uk, the company said: 'We are very sorry to report that Francis Matthews, best known to Gerry Anderson fans as the voice of the indestructible puppet hero Captain Scarlet, has died aged 86.

'Having previously had a policy of using American accents in their shows to aid sales to America, Gerry and Sylvia relaxed their casting requirements for Captain Scarlet as it was felt that British accents were now more acceptable Stateside than had previously been the case.

'After hearing Matthews’ uncanny impression of Cary Grant, a voice that would have been familiar to all on both sides of the Atlantic, he was cast in 1966.'

Matthews’s wife, the actress Angela Browne, died in 2001, Anderson Entertainment said. He is survived by his sons Damien, Paul and Dominic.

He also appeared alongside Morecambe and Wise in the films The Intelligence Men (1965) and That Riviera Touch (1966), leading to a close friendship with Eric Morecambe.

He also appeared throughout the 1960s and 1970s in a variety of TV comedy roles, including Eric & Ernie's Christmas Show, 1977.

The show was set in the year 2068, and began with an attack on a city in Mars by the human race.

The red planet was, at the time, inhabited by aliens known as the Mysterons, who had set up a colony there 3,500 years ago.

In response, the martians declared a 'war or nerves' on Earth, targeting world leaders and military installations in a bid to take over the planet.

They controlled the battle from space and used clones of humans they had killed to carry out terrorist attacks and threaten the globe's population.

Their first act of revenge however was to execute the World President.

The initial part of their plan was to kill Captain Scarlet, Spectrum's foremost weapon.

He is involved in a car accident, orchestrated by the Mysterons, and is quickly replaced in the organisation by an evil clone. 

However, the duplicate is shot dead by one of Scarlet's comrades, Captain Blue, and comes back to life free from alien control and virtually indestructible.

The trait, known as retro-metabolism, means when he was killed or injured, he was restored almost immediately to full health.

As a result, he went on painstaking suicide missions in the face of the enemy, knowing he would return without any physical damage.

Throughout the 1960s series, the martians carried on making terrorist threats and tried to follow through with their ability to create hoards of obedient clones.

Together with partners, Captain Blue, Lieutenant Green and The Angels, the immortal Captain Scarlet continued to thwart the extra-terrestrial threats.

He became Spectrum's most lethal agent and the key figure in defending the world, developing an ability to sense if a Mysteron was nearby.

The martians stepped up their effort by building another complex on the Moon, but Spectrum countered it by developing state-of-the-art weapons known as the Mysteron Gun and Mysteron Detector.

The show was first broadcast on ATV Midlands in September 1967 and lasted until May 1968.

Since then, the programme has been transmitted in more than 40 other countries, including the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.

The BBC then purchased the programme in 1993 and the episodes have since been re-run a number of times, making Francis Matthews and the puppet an integral part of children's television.
