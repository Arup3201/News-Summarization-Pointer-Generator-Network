As soldiers marched in formation, missiles and jetfighters were on display, and troops showed off their range of camouflage suit, the president of Iran saw the opportunity to emphasize his moderate policies.

President Hassan Rouhani spoke of his outreach to the West in the negotiations between Iran and the world powers over Tehran's controversial nuclear program, saying Iran is ‘not after war, but after logic and talks’.

Speaking ahead of the annual military parade on National Army Day, President Rouhani said Iran has shown it has no hostile intentions toward anyone in the world, including the United States, which has long been considered an enemy.

‘During
 the talks, we announced to the world and we say so again: we are not 
after war, we are after logic, we are after talks,’ Rouhani said.

He
 touted Iran's diplomatic outreach and said the backing of the military 
and the nation was crucial. ‘Support by the armed forces and support by 
our brave people have empowered the officials in charge of the talks on 
the diplomatic front.’

The 
Iranian president made no mention of archfoe Israel but said Iran ‘will 
not invade any country,’ although it would ‘resist any invasion.’

Rouhani
 also assured neighboring countries that Iran seeks better ties with 
them, saying that ‘neighbors should know that our army supports peace 
and stability.’

The remarks were a stark contrast to Rouhani's belligerent predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Since
 he was elected last June, Rouhani has pledged to resolve the nuclear 
dispute with the West and end painful economic sanctions imposed over 
Tehran's controversial nuclear program, which the West fears could 
result in the making of a nuclear weapon.

Tehran
 denies the charge, saying its nuclear activities - mainly those 
surrounding its uranium enrichment, which is a possible pathway to 
nuclear arms - are meant for peaceful purposes only, such as power 
generation and cancer treatment. Iran also asserts it has a right to 
enrich uranium under international law.

Iran
 and six world powers - the five permanent members of the U.N. Security 
Council plus Germany - reached an interim deal in November that put 
limits on Tehran's enrichment levels in exchange for an easing of some 
sanctions.

Talks are 
ongoing for a final deal that would remove all possibilities that the 
Islamic Republic could use its capabilities to build a nuclear weapon.

In
 Friday's parade, Iran showcased its air defense systems, including the 
S-200 Russian-made, medium to high altitude surface-to-air missile 
system designed primarily to track, target, and destroy aircraft and 
cruise missiles.

On display
 were also fighter jets such as U.S.-made F-4 and F-14, Russian-made 
MIG-29 and Sukhoi-24, as well as Iran's indigenous fighter plane, 
Saegheh. The parade also showed off a newer version of the short range, 
surface-to-surface Fajr-5, Nazeat and Zelzal missiles.

Iran has tried to achieve military self-sufficiency since 1992 and has also produced light submarines and torpedoes.
