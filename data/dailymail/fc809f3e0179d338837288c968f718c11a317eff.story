One of Mitt Romney's high school classmates says that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee was 'evil' in his younger years, and acted like he was a schoolboy gone mad 'like Lord Of The Flies'.

The Romney camp was reeling after the revelations that he forcibly shaved the head of a high school classmate who was regularly taunted for being gay.

The former governor of Massachusetts grabbed tearful John Lauber and hacked away with a pair of scissors because he thought his bleached blond hair was ‘wrong’.

Mr Romney also supposedly mocked another student who was a closeted gay by shouting ‘Atta girl!’ when he tried to speak in class.

Now, in damage control mode, Mr Romney's campaign staff have contacted a number of the candidate's former classmates to try to get them to speak out publicly on his behalf.

That plight isn't going so well, as a number of those contacted have been thinking the choice over.

Stu White, a friend of Mr Romney's who
 attended Cranbrook School with the candidate, said that he is 'still 
debating' if he will help the campaign after he received a call from Mr 
Romney's older brother Scott.

'It's been a long time since we've been pals,' Mr White told ABC News.

Though they may not have spoken for 
some time, Mr White's name does come up on the Romney campaign trail as 
he was the one who threw the party where Mr Romney met his wife Ann.

Mr White, who says he is not the only 
classmate to have been contacted by the campaign, was quoted in the 
explosive Washington Post article as saying that he has 'long been 
bothered' by the hair-cutting incident.

Phillip Maxwell, an old friend of Mr Romney's, called the incident 'bullying supreme'.

'I grew up with him.  We were best friends in elementary school.  We always remained friends.  Mitt is wonderful, very bright, an enormously energetic human being…   a friend all my life, but this was a side of him that I hadn’t seen,' Mr Maxwell said.

ABC News cites an unidentified 
classmate as saying that 'a lot of guys' who attended Cranbrook School 
have 'really negative memories' of Mr Romney's behavior.

Apparently those classmates are hesitant to come forward because of Mr Romney's denials when the incidents have been discussed.

The incident supposedly happened in the 
summer term in 1965 when Mr Lauber, who was a year below Mr Romney, came
 back from Spring Break with his hair dyed blond and styled so it was 
draped over one eye.

According to the Washington Post,
 Mr Romney would not let it go and told his friend Matthew Friedemann: 
‘He can’t look like that. That’s wrong. Just look at him!’

A
 few days later Mr Romney assembled a posse which found Mr Lauber, 
tackled him to the floor and held him down whilst the future governor of
 Massachusetts snipped away.

When it was completed, the crowd cheered Romney as he walked out of the room.

The
 incident was recalled by five former Cranbrook pupils including Thomas 
Buford, a retired prosecutor, who helped hold Mr Lauber down.

He said: ‘It happened very quickly, and to this day it troubles me. What a senseless, stupid, idiotic thing to do.’

Phillip Maxwell, who is now a lawyer, added: ‘It was a hack job. It was vicious.’

Mr Friedemann, a dentist, also felt bad for not stopping it happening and admitted Mr Lauber was ‘easy pickins’.

'It makes these fellows (who have told
 the stories) very remorseful. For (Mr Romney) not to remember it? It 
doesn't ring true. How could the fellow with the scissors forget it?' 
the man told ABC.

Mr Romney was quick to arrange a radio
 interview on Wednesday so that he could make an apology, though that 
does not seem sufficient to trump the symbolism of the story coming out 
the day after President Barack Obama publicly announced his support of 
same sex marriage.

'I participated in a lot of hijinks 
and pranks during high school and some may have gone too far. And for 
that I apologize,' Mr Romney said.

He continued to try to distance the 
incident from the debate over same-sex marriage by denying that the 
perceived homosexuality of the victims had nothing to do with the 
pranks.

'(Homosexuality) was the furthest 
thing from our minds back in the 1960s, so that was not the case,' he 
said, adding that the students involved 'didn't come out of the closet 
until years later.'

He said: ‘Back in high school, you 
know, I did some dumb things. If anyone was hurt by that or offended by 
that, obviously I apologize.

‘But overall, high school years were a long time ago'.

Interviews
 with Mr Romney’s former classmates at the $54,000 a year Cranbrook 
School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, reveal he was fond of jokes that 
were mostly good-natured by sometimes had a hard edge.

After
 the shaving incident Mr Lauber ‘seemed to disappear’ from life in 
school and was later expelled for smoking and died in 2004 of liver 
cancer.

Decades after it happened he ran into 
one of Romney’s friends who helped hold him down and told him: ‘It was 
horrible. It’s something I have thought about a lot since then.’

Friends recalled how he and his friends would be up all night larking around, the sound of his laughter filling the corridors at 2am.

In English class however things took a more sinister twist - Mr Romney had a habit of interrupting fellow pupil Gary Hummel, a closeted gay at the time, by shouting: ‘Atta girl!’

According to the Washington Post he also behaved in a ‘sour’ fashion towards scholarship student Lou Vierling when he found he he was from a poor area of Detroit.

Mr Romney’s wife Ann has claimed that contrary to his public image as a ‘tin man’, as one friend has claimed, he is actually a ‘wild and crazy man’.

It was a hack job. It was vicious.

And details about his pranks have 
come to light before, notably in the biography, ‘The Real Romney’,  by 
Boston Globe investigative reporters Michael Kranish and Scott Helman

The problem with the latest revelations however is that they suggest a cruelty which voters might find hard to stomach.

Romney’s
 most famous such incident is also his most controversial - when he 
strapped his dog to the top of his car whilst on a 12-hour drive from 
Massachusetts to Canada in 1983.

Seamus the Irish Setter was put in a crate on top of the vehicle because there wasn’t room inside.

Among
 the claims in ‘The Real Romney’, is that Mr Romney once shouted: ‘Oh 
yeah!’ and gave an impromptu rendition of the Michael Jackson hit 
‘Billie Jean’ at a meeting with other Mormons - whilst doing the 
Moonwalk.

While at Stanford University he 
dressed up as an anti-Vietnam protester to infiltrate what he thought 
was a plot to embarrass the college.

At
 Cranbrook he also once staged an ‘elaborate formal dinner’ in a busy 
corridor and another time impersonated a cop to scare two girls who were
 being driven around by two friends.

When Mr Romney flagged them down he discovered some beer in the trunk as they had agreed would happen - but left the women terrified they were about to get into trouble.

Mr Romney’s spokeswoman Andrea Saul said: ‘Anyone who knows Mitt Romney knows that he doesn’t have a mean-spirited bone in his body.’

Obama's dramatic change of heart on the issue of gay marriage yesterday sent shockwaves through the political world.

But while gay rights advocates applauded Obama's announcement on Wednesday, Republicans accused the commander-in-chief of pulling off a cynical political manoeuvre.

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus accused Obama of placating voters.

Priebus said in a statement: 'While President Obama has played politics on this issue, the Republican Party and our presumptive nominee Mitt Romney have been clear.'

Obama's announcement also opened up the first major battleground in this year's election campaign.

Romney himself did not swipe at Obama directly, but affirmed his own views on same-sex unions during an Oklahoma campaign stop, saying: 'I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman.'
