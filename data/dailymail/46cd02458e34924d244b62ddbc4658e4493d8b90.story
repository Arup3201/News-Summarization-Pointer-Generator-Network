She was the girl with the voice of an angel who swiftly fell to earth after a damaging series of revelations about her drinking binges and her rocky relationship with Welsh rugby star, Gavin Henson.

But Charlotte Church is back and this time she's got a bright blonde new 'do and a new-found feminist fervour, although according to the singer, feminism isn't something she's ever lacked.

I'd been a raving feminist all my life. I just hadn't realised it until reasonably recently. Until I had a little girl really.

Feminist: Church says she has been a raving feminist all her life but didn't realise until 'reasonably recently'

'And then everything started to annoy me - the way women are placed in the world really p***ed me off. The more you understand the way the world works, the clearer you are about certain issues.

'Mainly it was down to having kids. And having split with Gavin. Those things did massively inform me about life!'

It's no surprise that Church is protective of her daughter, particularly as growing up in the spotlight herself, she was forced to endure a succession of tabloid headlines criticising her developing body in the most embarrassing of ways.

'CHEST SWELL' read one headline, while her fledgling relationships and social life were pounced on.

As a result, she's wary about media focus on female celebrities and their children, telling The Telegraph's Stella Magazine: 'It makes me feel nauseous that it still happens [negative attention].

Tough: Church became famous at a very early age and was dogged by the media during her adolescence

'Today, going shopping in town, I thought I'd get the kids a couple of bits and bobs and the boy's toys are awesome - loads of cool things!

'But for girls, it's just image-obsessed crap. You've got all these ridiculous dolls, or you can paint your nails or do your make-up... It's all based around image.'

'I want to instill in Ruby [her six-year-old daughter by Henson] the idea that who gives a damn about what you look like? And hopefully I lead by example with that - 'cause I don't.'
