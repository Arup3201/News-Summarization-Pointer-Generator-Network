Green-fingered: Prince Charles has allowed the clippings from yew hedges at his Highgrove Estate to be turned into cancer-fighting drugs

He is well known for his love of homeopathy and natural health cures.

Now Prince Charles is allowing the clippings from yew hedges in his beloved gardens at Highgrove to be turned into cancer-fighting drugs.

This year 820lbs of cuttings from the common European yews that line large parts of his Gloucestershire estate are being turned into treatments for breast, ovarian, lung and Aids-related cancers.

The innovative scheme is the brainchild of a small Chichester-based company, Limehurst, which has been harvesting hedge clippings for use in cancer treatments for more than 20 years.

Over 4,000 public and private gardens take part in the scheme – and now Highgrove has been added to the list, with some cuttings made by the gardening prince’s own fair hand.

According to one royal aide, the prince loves order and structure in his gardens and has planted dozens of yews in the world-famous grounds of his private country home, particularly in the Sundial and Cottage Garden areas.

Many of these have been made in topiaries, leading to a lot of waste which is normally made into compost.

This year, however, Charles has given permission for the clippings from the hedges to be used in the treatment of cancer.

Certain species of yews – including those at Highgrove - contain cancer fighting molecules known as taxanes in the tips of their branches.

These molecules work as what is known as an ‘anti-mitotic’ and prevents cells from multiplying, halting the growth of those infected with cancer. They also effectively prevent blood vessels supporting cancer cell growth.

The clippings can only be harvested at a certain time each year – from June to September – when yews are producing their new year growth.

Outside of this period, the vital chemical extracts found within yew hedges are significantly reduced as the stems become too ‘woody’.

Once collected, the clippings are stabilised through drying at the Limehurt’s barn in West Sussex before being sent to Europe, where they are ground by drugs companies into powder and extraction of the compound takes place.

A ‘carrier fluid’ is used to dilute the dosage to enable intravenous delivery for cancer patients.

The molecules are incorporated into a number of well-known drugs used to treat both NHS patients and sufferers around the world.

As yew hedge clippings are not easily compostable, contain toxins and are not environmentally friendly to burn, the ‘recycling’ of them into anti-cancer drugs is also considered an eco-friendly method to make use of an otherwise unpleasant garden waste.

Limehurst, the company used by the heir to throne, pays for the clippings and Charles has donated the ‘few hundred pounds’ he has received from them to a local hospice, sources confirmed.

Since it started the initiative, the firm has recycled 5,500 tonnes of yew clippings. It also donates unwanted fees to the cancer charity CLIC Sargent.

A Clarence House spokesman told the Mail this week: ‘Using the yew hedge clippings is something we have done in the past and, after a break, we are starting to do it again.

‘The clipping are bought from the estate and the Prince of Wales has donated the money he has received to a local hospice. It is clearly a very worthwhile initiative.’

Britain’s oldest tree, an ancient pagan symbol of life and longevity, has long been known for its ‘life-saving’ properties.

Yew is from the Taxaceae family and it’s botanical name taxus baccata.

It is reasonably hardy and grows on any soil, although it prefers chalk and limestone.

Yew was the preferred wood for making medieval longbows because of its flexibility. It was also one of the seven sacred trees in Celtic tradition and was used by the Druids for prophecy.

It is widely believed that early Christians adopted ancient sacred sites for their churches, hence the proliferation of yew trees in churchyards.

Its toxic properties were also believed to ward off sheep from the graveyards.

In Japan it has been used to treat diabetes and induce abortions.

Native Indians in the USA also used a yew brew to treat rheumatism, fever and arthritis.

Now these molecules are being harvested by modern scientists in the fight against breast and ovarian cancer, with generally excellent results.
