Reigning world champions Laura Trott, Katie Archibald, Elinor Barker, and Joanna Rowsell headline the 15-strong Great Britain team for the European Track Championships in Guadeloupe later this month.

The quartet are all in the women's endurance team along with Ciara Horne, the 25-year-old who has stepped in after Dani King's announcement last week that she intends to focus on the road for next season.

With frontline sprinters like Jason Kenny, Phil Hindes, and Kian Emadi among those sitting out, there is a place for four-time national champion Callum Skinner in the men's sprint team.

Men's Sprint: Matt Crampton, Lewis Oliva, Callum Skinner

Women's Sprint: Rosie Blount, Katy Marchant

Men's Endurance: Mark Christian, Ed Clancy, Jon Dibben, Owain Doull, Andy Tennant

Women's Endurance: Katie Archibald, Elinor Barker, Ciara Horne, Joanna Rowsell, Laura Trott

As expected, Sir Bradley Wiggins is not in the squad, with his place in the men's endurance team taken by Mark Christian.

Shane Sutton, British Cycling's technical director, said: 'This European Championships marks the first opportunity for us to score Olympic qualification points for Rio and as such the squad as a whole is prepared and looking forward to this season's racing.

'It's good to see some new faces in the team with Ciara Horne, who joined the Academy programme last month, making selection as well as Mark Christian who returns to the track team as a guest rider following his strong performance at the Commonwealth Games.'

The championships take place from October 16-19. 

There is no place in the team for Olympic champion and former Tour de France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins
