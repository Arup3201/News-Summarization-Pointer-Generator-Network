A Washington man has been charged with second-degree murder for beating his infant daughter to death with an X-Box controller, police say.

Authorities say Ahmed Ibrahim, 26, of Burien, smashed his 8-month-old daughter's skull on Monday and then tried to convince police that his two-year-old daughter was the one who killed the infant. 

King County sheriff's deputies responded to the home Monday morning after receiving a call from the child's mother saying her baby wasn't breathing, KOMO News reports.

Deputies arrived to find the 8-month-old visibly battered with trauma to her head and her face distorted. The child was pronounced dead at the scene.

An autopsy found the infant had multiple skull fractures and died from severe, blunt force trauma to her head and torso. 

The medical examiner's office said it is 'highly unlikely' that a two-year-old caused such damage, according to The Seattle Times.

Seattle PI reports that Cecelia Gregson, senior deputy prosecutor, described the child's murder as 'brutal and sadistic' saying that Ibrahim 'viciously beat' the child.

The child's mother told authorities that she had left the infant and her two other children -- girls aged four and two -- in the care of her husband at 12.30am. She returned home from work at 10.30am and found Ibrahim lounging in a chair with the infant resting on his chest, Seattle PI reports.

She changed her clothes then went to pick up her baby only to find the child's face distorted and her body cold to the touch. She then rushed to a nearby relative's home for help.

After obtaining a search warrant, investigators arrested Ibrahim and described him as being 'on something' saying his speech was slurred and he repeatedly nodded off.  

Ibrahim described the infant as an 'aggressive child' and blamed the deceased 8-month-old for picking a fight with his two-year-old daughter who, he said, caused the infant's injuries by kicking and hitting her, KOMO News reports.

Investigators believe that the infant died shortly after Ibrahim beat her with an X-Box controller. Ibrahim denied drinking alcohol to police, but bottles of liquor were found in the home, Seattle PI reports. Ibrahim also denied abusing his children. 

However, the child's mother confessed that Ibrahim has a history of beating both her and their three children, KOMO reports. He reportedly beat the children with cords and hangers often, and even forcefully squeezes their lips shut when they cry.

Ibrahim was arrested Monday and charged Thursday with second-degree murder. He is being held at the Norm Maleng Regional Justice Center in Kent with bail set at $1 million.
