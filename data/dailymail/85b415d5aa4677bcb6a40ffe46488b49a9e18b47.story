The chief prosecutor in the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius today asked the court to place the double-amputee athlete under psychiatric observation after an expert said he had an anxiety disorder.

Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said he had no 
other option but to ask for a study of Pistorius' mental health 
following testimony by a psychiatrist, who said the Olympic runner's 
anxiety could have shaped the way he responded to perceived threats.

Judge Thokozile Masipa has not yet ruled on the request.

It came after psychiatrist Dr. Merryll Vorster said 
events during Pistorius' life, including the amputation of his lower 
legs as a baby and his late mother's habit of sleeping with a gun under 
her pillow, contributed to his 'increasing stress.'

'Traumatic assault': Pistorius was born without fibulas in his lower legs, leading to amputation at the age of 11 months

'No option': Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said he had no other option but to ask for a study of Pistorius' mental health following testimony by a psychiatrist, who said the Olympic runner's anxiety could have shaped the way he responded to perceived threats

'Overall, Mr. Pistorius appears to be a mistrustful and guarded person,' Vorster told the court.

Testifying
 for the defence about his 
mental state, Dr Vorster said that because Pistorius had his legs 
amputated at such a young age, it would have been impossible to 
reason with the baby, making the pyschological scars much deeper.

Pistorius was born without fibulas in his lower legs, leading to amputation at the age of 11 months.

'He was too young to understand why,' 
Vorster told the court. 'His mother could not have comforted him because
 he was pre-language phase. It would been perceived as traumatic 
assault.

Tragic: Pistorius is on trial for murder after shooting and killing his girlfriend, 29-year-old law graduate and model, Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year

Pistorius has said
 he killed girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp by mistake last year, fearing that
 there was an intruder in his home when he fired through a closed toilet
 door in the early hours of Feb. 14, 2013. The prosecution says he 
killed her intentionally after an argument.

But
 Dr Vorster said the Olympic athlete displayed 'escalating levels of 
anxiety' through his life when she interviewed him this month. She said 
she also spoke to members of Pistorius' family, some of his friends and 
his agent.

Pistorius' 
defense said at the outset of its case that it would show his feelings 
of 'vulnerability' and his disability contributed to him shooting 
Steenkamp. Pistorius is charged with premeditated murder and faces 25 
years to life in prison if convicted.

Vorster's
 testimony also dealt with what she said was Pistorius' fear of crime 
and how, because he was a double amputee, he reacted to perceived 
threats in a different way to other people. She noted Pistorius' mother,
 who died when he was a teenager, slept with a gun in her bed and also 
had a fear of being attacked in her home.

Insecurity: The psychiatrist also said his parents' divorce when he was a child would have added to the 27-year-old's general feelings of anxiety and insecurity

Cross-examining
 Vorster at the start of the eighth week of the trial, prosecutor Nel 
asked if she was saying Pistorius had a mental illness and should 
undergo a 30-day period of observation, and if he was changing his 
defense to one of 'diminished responsibility.'

Nel
 also asked the psychiatrist if someone who was suffering from an 
anxiety order of the kind that she had diagnosed in Pistorius, and also 
had access to guns, would be a danger to society. Vorster said the 
person would, indeed, be a danger.

Talking
 specifically about the shooting of Steenkamp, Vorster said Pistorius 
was more likely to try and 'fight' what he thought was an intruder than 
run away, because his disability meant it was harder for him to flee. 
Pistorius was on his stumps when he fired four times through the toilet 
stall door with his licensed 9mm pistol, killing Steenkamp.

Vorster
 also said his parents' divorce when he was a child would have added to 
the 27-year-old's general feelings of anxiety and insecurity.

After
 his parents split, Pistorius was brought up by his mother, who died of 
cancer when he was aged 15. Pistorius has frequently spoken of his love 
for his mother and the difficulty her death caused him.

Pistorius competed against able-bodied spinters on carbon-fibre prosthetics, becoming one of the most recognised names in athletics. Besides a clutch of Paralympic medals, he reached the semi-finals of the 400m at the London 2012 Olympics.
