A man accused of beheading a grandmother with a machete in her back garden has refused to appear via video link at the Old Bailey.

Nicholas Salvadore, 25, is alleged to have killed Palmira Silva, 82, in the garden of her home in Edmonton, north London, last Thursday.

Today he declined to appear at a first Crown Court hearing via video link from Belmarsh prison in south east London.

Defence lawyer Bernard Richmond, QC, told the court: 'I am instructed that he does not wish to come into the video link room even with his legal team. He wants to be present in court.

‘He wants to be present - that’s the position.’

Unemployed Salvadore, of Enfield, north London, is charged with murdering Mrs Silva and assaulting a police officer, PC Bernie Hamilton. He has not yet entered pleas to either of the charges.

No application was made for bail and Judge Brian Barker QC, the Recorder of London, remanded Salvadore in custody until a plea and case management hearing on November 25.

He added: ‘I hope he will co-operate with the defence team in the future.'

Mrs Silva reportedly moved to London from her native Italy with her husband Domenico six decades ago. They married and had a daughter, Celestina, and a son, Rino.

Prosecutor Jonathan Rees, QC, said Mrs Silva was ‘subjected to a brutal assault, struck repeatedly to the back of the head with a wooden pole, causing it to break.'

He added: ‘She was stabbed with a machete to her torso. At this point she effectively collapsed to the floor, partially inside her back door.’

An array of floral tributes were left outside the family's restaurant, Silva's Cafe, in Church Street, near Edmonton Green station, after last week's attack.

The first 999 call was made at 1.07pm on Thursday afternoon and Salvadore was arrested at 1.45pm, the court heard.

Salvadore, who is a former pupil at Nightingale Academy secondary school, is then accused of assaulting PC Hamilton during his arrest.

The former labourer was shot with a Taser by armed police who arrested him that afternoon close to the scene of the attack.

He was treated in hospital prior to being charged the following day.
