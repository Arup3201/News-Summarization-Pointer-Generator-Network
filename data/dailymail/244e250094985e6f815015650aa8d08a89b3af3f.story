Once, being a WAG took short skirts, fake tan and plenty of make-up. Now, it seems it requires quite the opposite.

The new WAGs are not the Wives and Girlfriends of footballers, but the Women Ageing Gracefully – and without a false eyelash in sight.

The best examples of this elegant breed include Helen Mirren and Joanna Lumley, according to a poll.

Age gracefully: Women think that it's time to start aging gracefully at Cyndi Lauper's age of 59 and voted Helen Mirren the most gracefully aged

It found that, for most women, 59 is the age when they have a radical rethink about their style.

But many also believe that some things
 should be ditched decades earlier.

The  survey of 2,000 women over 45 
found that most believe heavy make-up, mini-skirts and glitter become 
unacceptable once a woman hits 40.

A third said that women of that age should avoid false eyelashes, and 40 per cent said that lots of blusher was not a good look.

Doing it well: Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley were also in the top five women who age gracefully

Leather trousers and mini-skirts 
should be binned at the age of  41, the respondents insisted, while 43 
is apparently the time to  ditch the heavy eyeliner and set aside the 
fake tan.

More than half of those polled said women over 50 could not 
get away with tattoos.

Bleached hair is also not flattering for the 
over-50s, according to a third of those questioned, while 45 is the age 
to put away those tight tops.

In fact, the only product which stood 
the test of time was red lipstick, which the participants agreed was a 
timeless classic that can be worn at any age.

Ungraceful: Madonna and Anne Robinson were at the bottom of the poll when it came to who aged the most gracefully

Time to give it up: Jennifer Lopez, 43, and Christie Brinkley, 58, have passed the age when women believe it's acceptable to wear leather trousers and mini skirts

1.    Helen Mirren

2.    Judi Dench

3.    Joanna Lumley

4.    Twiggy

5.    Nigella Lawson

6.    Lorraine Kelly

7.    Honour Blackman

8.    Lulu

9.    Fern Britton

10.  The Duchess of Cornwall

The poll found that women believed 
dressing appropriately was the best way of growing old gracefully – but 
they weren’t the only ones.

A resounding three-quarters of men also said
 that certain looks were ageing on women and confessed that they were 
put off by those who try too hard.

Alongside Miss Mirren, 67, and Miss 
Lumley, 66, Dame Judi Dench, 78, and Twiggy, 63, topped the list of 
celebrity women who embrace their age with style, while Madonna, 54, and
 Anne Robinson, 68, were named as examples of those who are failing to 
grow old gracefully.

Nearly a third of the women polled 
feared ending up in the same position, confessing that they worried that
 they were too old to wear certain items in their wardrobe.

However, 74 per cent said they would 
avoid cosmetic surgery in favour of a more natural regime. The poll 
found that most women believe a good diet and a strict skincare regime 
were key to looking youthful.

And a confident 59 per cent said they 
think they look younger than they actually are and don’t need the latest
 trends in fashion and make-up to look good.

A spokesman for Nurture Replenish 
Skincare, which commissioned the survey, said: ‘Many women will be able 
to relate to these findings. It’s true that as you get older you may 
have to adapt your look but every woman will face this stage at 
different times in her life.

‘What’s important to remember is to be yourself and don’t be forced to look a certain way because you feel you have to.’
