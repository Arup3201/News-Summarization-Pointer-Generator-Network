Australian Midfielder Tim Cahill has revealed the moment a Chilean opponent openly admitted to being a cheat during the Socceroos 3-1 defeat to the South Americans.

Cahill, at a post-match press conference, told reporters that he directly called Jara a 'cheat' to his face following a heated scuffle in which the pair jostled for the ball. The Australian midfielder made the remark because he felt unfairly yellow carded, and blamed the referee's wrong decision on Jara who Cahill said fouled him first. It left the Australian midfield with a bitter taste in his mouth post match where he told reporters it was remarks like this that undermined sportsmanship in the game.

Cahill said the Chilean intentionally fouled him first when he 'kicked-out' at the Socceroo: 'The left back (Jara) kicked out at me when I was trying to run past him for a cross and I pushed him away - and I got the yellow card.' In the heat of the moment, Cahill said he called Gonzalo a 'cheat', leaving the Australian midfielder in disbelief when Jara allegedly replied 'yes, I'm a cheat, so what?'

The Socceroo said Jara's blatant admission is the kind of behaviour Cahill wants stamped out of the sport, particularly when it comes to such a high-profile tournament like the World Cup. 'That is not gamesmanship ... this needs to be out of the game."

Cahill's, and the Socceroos only goal in the 3-1 defeat to Chile, now mean's the Australian has scored more goals in World Cups than both Argentinian Lionel Messi,  Portugal's Christiano Ronaldo and England's Wayne Rooney combined. Cahill's goalscoring tally of four, is three more than Messi who has just one goal=and double Ronaldo's tally of two. Rooney is yet to score a goal in 594 minutes of World Cup soccer.

Passionate fans in Brazil and Australia got right behind the Socceroos as they watched the team's 2014 World Cup  opening match against Chile at Arena Pantanal in Cuiaba.

Despite facing stiff competition from the South American nation in the Group B opener, fans were hopeful as they cheered on the squad, captained by Mile Jedinak.

With Chile scoring two early goals in the first 15 minutes a of play within two minutes to lead 2-0, a goal by Tim Cahill in the 35th saw Australian fans rejoice, with the side's chances of winning given a major boost. Chahill scored the goal on the end of a cross from Mathew Leckie.

But Australia's star goal scorer was awarded a yellow card in the 44th, casting doubts of over the rest Cahill's tournament.

Minutes into the second half, it looked as if Australia had equalised, with Cahill again scoring a 'goal' headed from a cross by Leckie. But the linesman raised his flag, with Cahill offside and to the goal disallowed.

But Australia's hopes appeared to be dashed, with Chile scoring to take their lead to 3-1 in the 92nd minute.

Goalkeeper Mathew Ryan's grandmother Margaret Weir was watching the game from Mt Druitt netball courts in Emerton in Sydney's west.

'Australia played quite well, but he (Ryan) will be cranky about that last goal that went through in through in the extra time,' Mrs Weir told MailOnline. 'It's hard to believe a Mt Druitt boy is out there playing in the World Cup for Australia.'

Mrs Weir said she was 'over the moon' for the grandson and that he had the support of the entire family and the Mt Druitt community. 'He's worked really really hard for it,' she said.

'We've been staying in touch on Viber. He's very focused and trying to keep his emotions in control and not think about some of the players that he will be out there playing against like  Robin van Persie (of the Netherlands squad).'

Mrs Weir said his family in Australia was watching all his games, while Ryan's mother and sister were in Brazil to cheer him on from the sidelines.

Ryan, who plays for Club Brugge KV in Belgium, was named in the Socceroos squad in May, and returned to Australia to go into camp, before flying out for the world cup.

His naming in the Australian squad capped off a stellar end to the end of the Belgian competition, which saw Ryan's club play its last game of the season on May 18, and him be named the Belgian Pro League's goalkeeper of the year.

Excited fans in Sydney watched the game live at The Star in Pyrmont, and while most were covered in green and gold, there was also support for Chile.

Socceroos supporter Stephenie Hager, of Killara, was at the screening and said it was the next best thing to watching the match live in Brazil. 'It was great - the atmosphere was just amazing,' she told MailOnline. 'Everyone was really getting into it, even the Chile fans, we were all getting in.'

Despite Australia's loss, the 22-year-old fan said she was not discount the team yet and was hopeful they could come back to beat the Netherlands in their next game.

'I definitely think they can beat them after how they lifted their performance in the second half, maybe they just needed to play their first game,' she said. Ms Hager added that Chile out performed Australia in passing the ball directly and accuracy.

With  defense which saw Australia stop a goal by Chile a highlight, Ms Hager said the hardest part of the game to watch was Chile's goal in the last four minutes of the game.

She also said Cahill's goal was a standout moment. 'When Cahill scored, I was getting the feeling he was about to do something amazing,' she said
