All eyes should have been on Andy Murray as he continues his successful Australian Open campaign in Melbourne at the first grand slam of the year.

But as his stylish girlfriend Kim Sears arrived courtside, all swishy hair and doll-like features, it must have been hard for the Oz tennis fans not to be distracted for a moment.

Kim looked ladylike and demure despite the heat, choosing a £109 painterly floral pencil skirt by Ted Baker and blush shift top to support her victorious partner at the second-round match.

Carrying her trusty Mulberry Willow bag -
 which is still for sale at £1,350 - the 25-year-old artist took her seat at 
the Rod Laver Arena.

Her make-up was dewy and natural while her glossy hair looked freshly blowdried.

She is supporting her boyfriend of eight years as he hopes to claim the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup for the first time.

Murray made a stunning start at Melbourne Park on Tuesday as he raced past Go Soeda of Japan in just 87 minutes.

Kim wore Ted Baker then too, opting to show off toned, tanned legs in a pair of the designer's
 shorts as she cheered her partner on in his men's singles match.

Loyal
 Kim was all smiles as she sat with Andy's second biggest fan, his 
mother Judy. The duo are fiercely supportive of Andy, who is partaking in his second competitive
tournament following his back surgery in October.

Andy and Kim were last pictured in public when the tennis ace became an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in October.

While
 the couple are yet to tie the knot, the Scots tennis star recently 
revealed he is thinking about having children with Kim, with whom he shares a house with in Oxshott, Surrey.

Australian Opens

Murray,
26, reckons he is probably more than halfway through his career and is 
now beginning to contemplate what to do with his life when he hangs up 
his racket and quits the pro circuit. 

He
said: ‘I can see myself having a family one day. It is something that 
I’m starting to think about because Kim and I have been together for 
eight years.’ 

In his new 
book reflecting on his life and career so far, the Wimbledon champion is
effusive about his girlfriend, who he first met at the U.S. Open in 2005.

Writing
in the book, he said:
‘You’re in these huge cities meeting new people all the time and it 
would be easy to get your head turned.

Eye spy! Judy Murray, who famously supports her son at every match, was also in the stands donning a floral cap

Is that my seat? Kim mixed up her fashion with high-street shorts from a few seasons ago and a £1,350 Mulberry Willow Tote

All smiles: Kim chats to James Ward, British no.3 behind Andy Murray, and Dan Evans, as they watch the match

‘But
Kim’s always been there for me. She really cares about me and helps 
with so many things. She always has. That’s why we have such a great 
relationship.’ 

The 
Wimbledon winner admitted the experience of looking after their two dogs
- Border terriers Maggie May and Rusty - would stand them in good stead
if he and Miss Sears were to start a family.

He said: ‘It’s not the same as having kids - or at least I don’t think it is - but that’s sometimes what it feels like.’

As well as bonding over their love of dogs, he said they also share a passion for travel and don’t get homesick.

Perfect match: Murray first met Miss Sears when 
she was on holiday with her father, who was coaching Daniela Hantuchova 
on the Women's Tennis Association Tour

Murray
also praised Miss Sears’s ability to gauge when he needs company and 
when he wants to be alone as ‘fundamental’ to their relationship.

He said: ‘Kim sees all of the emotions when I win or lose a match, she can tell how I’m really feeling.’

After banking nearly £20million in 
prize money, Murray admits to feeling ‘vulnerable’ when bombarded by 
people wanting to do deals, so he relies on ‘savvy’ Miss Sears to spot 
those trying to leech on to him.

Murray
 is playing well in Melbourne so far and could take on Auckland winner 
John Isner in the fourth round, Roger Federer or Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in 
the quarter-finals and the world number one Nadal in the last four.

girlfriend Kim Sears, who looked sophisticated and regal, were last pictured together at 
Buckingham Palace, where he became an Officer of the 
Order of the British Empire (OBE)

Earlier this year, Kim wore an £85 blouse from 
Whistles, left, and then a £150 dress from the same store, right, with 
her Topshop blazer to watch Andy play tennis
