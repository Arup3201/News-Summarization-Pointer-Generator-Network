A team of firefighters had to free a trapped toddler and her cat from a scratching post after the four-year-old followed her moggie inside.

Amelie Kuester had been playing with her pet moggy Janko when he ran inside the 32-inch hollow post at their home in the city of Graz, in south-eastern Austria.

But when little Amelie tried to crawl in after him she got her head wedged in the entrance and could not get out again.

Firemen were called to a home in Austria where four-year-old Amelie Kuester had got her head and her cat trapped inside a cat scratching post

Firefighters called to the home had to lure the cat out before sawing the post in two.

Mum Leah, 32, said: 'I was in the kitchen making Amelie lunch when I heard her start crying.

'Worried that she had fallen over or something I rushed in to the living room and found her lying on the floor with her head inside Janko's scratcher.

'I tried to get it off but her head was well and truly stuck and no amount of twisting or pulling was going to get it off.'

'Meanwhile, Janko was still inside and obviously thought this was part of the game and was playing with her hair.'

Unable to free the youngster, desperate Leah decided to call the fire brigade.

Three firefighters were pictured attempting to force the post from Amelie's head after she followed her cat inside and became trapped

Three firefighters lured the cat out and then sawed the post in two before freeing the girl's head using hand soap. 

A fire brigade spokesman said: 'When we arrived the little girl was very upset and clinging onto her favourite Elmo toy.

'The first thing we had to do was get the cat out, otherwise he might have been sawn in half.

'After luring him out with a piece of string, we then set about freeing the girl by sawing the tube in half and then using loads of hand soap to reduce the friction as we twisted it off her head.

'She was a bit red and dazed afterwards but otherwise fine.'

Grateful mum Leah said: 'I felt very embarrassed because firemen have far more important things to do than cut up scratching posts, but they were very kind and helpful.'
