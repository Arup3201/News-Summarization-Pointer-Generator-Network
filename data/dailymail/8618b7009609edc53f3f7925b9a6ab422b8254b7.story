Former Scotland football captain Colin Hendry has been given a harassment warning after allegedly pestering his ex-girlfriend.

The 49-year-old former defender began seeing beautician Sarah Kinder after his wife Denise died aged 42 in 2009 following surgery to correct botched liposuction.

The warning does not count as a criminal record, but runs for a year to stop a person's conduct in the future causing distress.

According to The Sun and the BBC the warning refers to Ms Kinder, who Hendry began dating in 2010 and who helped him rebuild his life after his wife's death.

A spokesman for Lancashire Police said: 'A 49-year-old man from Lytham has been given an harassment warning.'

Hendry, who lives in Lytham, Lancashire, is due in court in Blackpool on March 4 charged with drink-driving over a separate incident.

The former defender played for Manchester City, Blackburn Rovers and Rangers and captained Scotland in the 1998 World Cup, which saw the team knocked out in the group stage.

Since his career, which also involved playing for Bolton Wanderers and Blackpool and being named player of the year in 1989-90, he has turned coach and managed Blackpool and Clyde.

His personal life prompted headlines and widespread sympathy in 2009 when he lost his wife Denise to a hospital infection, which caused meningitis in her brain which killed her.

She fell ill following a routine operation to correct liposuction which had gone badly wrong seven years earlier, puncturing her bowel and leaving her in regular pain.

Speaking to the Scottish Express in 2010, Hendry said meeting Ms Kinder had helped him and his children pick up the pieces of their lives.

'With all the troubles I’ve got in my life and am battling through... as a family we are just trying to take our lives forward,' he said.

'Life will never be the same for us again... The majority of people who know what has happened in my life will be sympathetic to any good news I have.'
