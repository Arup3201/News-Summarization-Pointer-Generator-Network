James Packer has branded his personal life a 'disaster' just months after being romantically linked to Miranda Kerr.

The billionaire businessman, 46, split from his wife Erica in September and three months later was rumoured to be dating the former Victoria's Secret model following the end of her marriage to Orlando Bloom. (Neither commented on the claims.)

In a new interview with Forbes magazine, he says: 'Business is good right now, but now my personal life is a disaster.'

'I had a marriage breakdown last year,' he continued. 'The last thing I think I am is perfect. I’m just trying to do the best job I can. I’m trying to be the best father I can to my kids. I’m trying to do the best job I can running my business.'

Packer - who is increasing his billion-pound fortune by buying casinos - and former wife Erica were long-term friends with Kerr, 30, and Bloom.

The newly-separated pair were rumoured to be spending time together late last year following their respective break-ups just 45 days apart.

Packer, who has three children with ex-wife Erica, has known Kerr for years - with the billionaire thought to have given the former Victoria's Secret model business advice when she launched her range of beauty products, Kora, several years ago.

The two have also holidayed together in the past with their families, spending time in Bora Bora in May 2012. Kerr and ex-husband Orlando Bloom, along with their baby Flynn, also enjoyed the Packers' largesse during a seaside sojourn with the hosts and two of their three children, Indigo and Jackson.

Kerr's mother Therese told The Australian Women's Weekly this month that she took the rumours about her daughter dating Packer 'with a grain of salt'.

'There are so many untruths,' she said.

'We take it with a grain of salt. If you were to take everything that's written as truth, you would get upset. We choose to ignore it.'

When asked if there was any truth to the 'Kerr-acker' rumours that were circulating, she said: 'If there was, Miranda is not going to tell me.

'When the story broke, I said "What's the go?" She said "Mum, don't believe everything you read. So, who knows?'

It is understood Packer, 46, and Kerr, 30, met through their ex-partners.Erica was living and working in the UK over a decade ago when she first befriended Bloom.

Bloom and the three-month pregnant model made their relationship official with a private wedding in 2010 - but they confirmed their separation last October after three years of marriage.Kerr has been linked to a number of high-profile men during the past year. She was linked with actor Leonardo DiCaprio in December 2012 and earlier this year similar rumours surfaced regarding actor Gerard Butler.

Mr Packer has for years been associated with shapely brunettes, including model Jennifer Flavin, his former fiancee Kate Fischer and his first wife, bikini model Jodhi Meares.
