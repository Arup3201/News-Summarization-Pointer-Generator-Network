Activists in Turkey have called for protestors to be released and police chiefs to be removed from office in a list of demands to the government after almost a week of demonstrations.

They said if the demands are met it could end days of anti-government protests that have engulfed the country, as trade unions joined the outpouring of anger and called on the prime minister to resign.

The activist group denounced Recep Tayyip Erdogan's 'vexing' style and urged the government to halt Taksim Square 
redevelopment plans and lift restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly.

In a meeting with the deputy prime minister Bulent Arinç, they also called for the government to ban the use of tear gas by police and demanded that officials responsible for the violent crackdown be removed from office.

The demonstrations were sparked on Friday by the heavy-handed police response to a protest against trees being uprooted in Istanbul's landmark Taksim Square.

It snowballed into nationwide protests against what demonstrators see as Erdogan's increasingly authoritarian rule.

Police have deployed water cannons and tear gas has clouded the country's city centres. The Ankara-based Human Rights Association says close to 1,000 people have been injured and more than 3,300 people have been detained over five days of protests.

The protests appear to have developed spontaneously and remain leaderless. It was not at all certain that the tens of thousands of protesters would heed any call by the group to cease.

The group of academics, architects and environmentalists, known as the Taksim Solidarity Platform, was formed to try to keep Taksim Square from redevelopment, including the rebuilding of an Ottoman army barracks and a shopping centre.

Among the demands presented to the deputy prime minister were calls for police to stop using tear gas

Protesters have also demanded restrictions on freedom of expression be lifted by the government

The protests were sparked by fury over a  pre-dawn police raid on Friday to roust activists camping out in an attempt to stop the plans.

Protests appeared calmer today, even as thousands of trade union members on a two-day strike marched to Taksim and into central Ankara.

 In Ankara, protesters sarcastically called themselves 'looters', a reference to the name Erdogan's used for the demonstrators last week.

There were scattered violent clashes overnight on roads leading to Erdogan's offices in Ankara and Istanbul, as well as in the city of Antakya, near the Syrian border, where a protester was killed by an apparent blow to the head.

Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc, who is standing in for Erdogan while he is on a trip to Northern Africa, has offered an olive branch to protesters, apologising for what he said was a 'wrong and unjust' crackdown on the sit-in.

Erdogan had inflamed protesters, calling them an extremist fringe, and refusing to back away from plans to revamp Taksim.

'The steps the government takes from now on will define the course of society's reaction,' Eyup Muhcu, the head of a chamber of architects, said after meeting with Arinc.

U.S .Secretary of State John Kerry said earlier this week that it was troubled by reports of excessive force by the police. He also said Washington is 'deeply concerned' by the large number of people who have been injured.

The comments angered Turkey, with its state-run news agency reporting that Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu accused the U.S. of treating it 'as a second-class democracy.'

He also complained that Washington did not react to similar protests in other countries, the Anadolu Agency said.

Kerry has maintained that his comments were not intended as interference in Turkey's internal affairs, but an honest expression of the importance the United States places on such values in all countries.

In Turkey's third largest city, Izmir, police detained 25 people for 'spreading untrue information' on social media and allegedly inciting people to join the protests, Anadolu reported.

They were detained late on Tuesday, the agency said. Police were looking for 13 others, it added.

The people were wanted for allegedly 'inciting enmity and hatred', the agency said. A lawyer for the suspects denied that claim.

'I have look at (their) files and examined the tweets,' the Radikal newspaper quoted lawyer Sevda Erdan Kilic as saying.

'There is nothing there to provoke the people (into rioting). They are sentiments that we all share.'

It was not immediately clear what the Twitter comments were.

Turkey's main broadcast media have been criticized for shunning the coverage of police brutality at the protest onset. Many people turned to social media to keep up to date.

Erdogan has referred to social media as 'the worst menace to society'.
