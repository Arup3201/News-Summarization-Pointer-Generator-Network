The once graceful bird’s agonised wheezing heard by rescuers as he struggled to keep afloat could so easily have been a tragic swansong.

But somehow, despite being shot in the skull and through the windpipe with a crossbow by mindless thugs leaving him barely able to breath, the traumatised swan was still clinging to life when the RSPCA officers arrived.

Incredibly, after undergoing an emergency operation and making a miracle recovery in just three weeks, he was then declared fit enough to be reunited with his mate.

In a poignant illustration of swans’ fabled habit of mating for life, she had refused to leave the stretch of canal where the horrific attack happened - and was there waiting faithfully for him as his saviours fought back tears at their reunion.

RSPCA veterinary officer Beverley Panto, who cared for the cob or male swan at the charity’s Stapeley Grange Wildlife Hospital, in Nantwich, Cheshire, said: ‘It was a day we thought would never come.

'His injuries were absolutely horrendous and it was touch and go if he’d survive.’ 

A walker alerted the RSPCA to the swan’s plight after spotting him on the canal at Penketh on June 18. 

One of the steel crossbow bolts had pierced his skull, missing his brain by millimetres. The other went into his neck, through his windpipe and out the other side.

Both were still lodged in the swan, but he was still just about swimming on the water when the rescuers got to him. They managed to get the traumatised animal to the bank with the aid of a swan hook, a specialist tool similar to a shepherd’s crook.

From there he was rushed to vet Alan Humphreys who carried out an emergency operation to remove the bolts and insert a tube into the side of the swan’s body.

This meant he could breathe via the air sac system which forms part of birds’ respiratory system. After a night under close observation at the Liverpool vet’s, he was transferred to the RSPCA hospital. 

Miss Panto said: ‘He was still in a lot of pain and distress and struggling to breathe when he came into us. He was at this point breathing through a tube in his side so we were really lucky that birds have an air sac system – these sort of balloons that are extensions of their lungs – so he could breathe while bypassing his injuries and the windpipe.

‘We gave him pain relief, anti-biotics and fluids. We weren’t sure if he was going to make it and there were a few worrying times when he lost weight and we were worried about swelling in his brain. 

'But he rallied and pulled through. It’s incredible that he’s still with us.’ An endoscopy last week showed his windpipe was healing. The tube was removed from his side and to everyone’s relief he could breather normally again.

After a few days interacting with other swans on a pond at the hospital, it was decided he was ready to be returned to the wild. Staff took him to the site in a carry cage before releasing him there on Tuesday.

Lee Stewart, the hospital’s manager, said: ‘Swans are difficult to relocate and as his mate was waiting for him we decided it was best to put him back where he came from. 

‘We didn’t want to split the pair up and we couldn’t move his mate somewhere else as we need veterinary grounds to lift any animal and there were none for her as she was uninjured.’ 

Locals have nicknamed the male swan Sidney and, along with members of an angling club, are helping to keep an eye on the pair and make sure there are no further attacks.

Mr Stewart said: ‘When he was released, his mate was very excited and was displaying by arching her wings. He swam past her at first, like he was playing hard to get. Then he turned back and went to her. It was a beautiful moment.’ 

Police are still seeking the swan’s attackers. Swans are a protected species and, according to ancient law, all owned by the Queen. 

Killing or injuring them used to be classed as treason, but now those who do so face maximum sentences of a fine of up to £20,000 or six months jail under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.

Mr Stewart said: ‘This is one of the worst cases I’ve ever seen. I cannot understand the mentality of whoever did this to an innocent bird. It’s really sick and whoever did it needs help.’
