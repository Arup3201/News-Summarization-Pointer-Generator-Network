Seven children ranging in age from 20 to just three years old have been left orphaned after their parents were killed in a tragic car accident in Omaha at the weekend.

Frank, 41, and Yvonne Pivonka, 40, were returning from a concert in the early hours of Sunday morning when their SUV overturned near West Point.

Investigators say the driver lost control, causing the vehicle to crash into a ditch and roll several times.

According to the sheriff’s department, both victims were thrown from the vehicle and pronounced dead at the scene.

Authorities have not said who was driving, but a local man found a dead deer on the highway and it is believed the couple may have swerved to avoid hitting it, reports Omaha.com.

Police used the Pivonka’s cellphones to locate their whereabouts and their bodies were discovered at 5:20 a.m. on Monday.

The couple were big music fans and regularly traveled to listen to friend's bands.

On Saturday they had paid a visit to the Roadhouse Lounge in West Point, to see a local cover band called John Doe.

Frank Pivonka also sang lead vocals for local cover bands The Grind, Sidecar 69, DoubleZero and Headspace.

‘They were just great people, great supporters of the music scene,' said Jason McClain, John Doe’s drummer. 'When they came out to see us Saturday, they were just so happy.'

Wife Yvonne would join her husband's bands at practice when she wasn’t busy taking the couple’s seven kids to and from school.

The Pivonkas’ two oldest daughters, 19-year-old Sabrina and 20-year-old Angel, had already left home, but son Frankie, 17, together with Abigail, 3, Sophia, 7, Isabelle, 13, and Jasmine, 15, will now live with Yvonne’s sister Cathy Cattlett.

Frank and Yvonne Pivonka had started dating when they were in high school, although they went to different schools

'They were all about their kids, they loved their kids,' she told WOWT. Cattlett already has a husband and two sons of her own.

As well as being a jobbing musician, Frank Pivonka also worked as a mechanic.

'He was a good father - he loved his children,' Brenda Lessner, one of his sisters told Omaha.com. 'He wanted everything for them, no matter how hard they struggled; he did everything for them.'

The couple had started dating when they were in high school, although they went to different schools.

The family is currently trying to find a venue large enough to support the 500 to 600 people who want to attend the funeral.

A Gofundme page had already raised more than $14,000 and the site says the goal is to raise $40,000. Fundraising concerts are also planned for this weekend.
