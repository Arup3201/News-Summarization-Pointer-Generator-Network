Caretaker Keith Millen admits the new Crystal Palace manager could quickly opt to dismantle the team built by former boss Tony Pulis.

The Eagles were stunned on Thursday night by the abrupt exit of the man who had guided them to Premier League safety last season, with Pulis reportedly unhappy with the way the south London club had done their transfer business in the summer.

Millen took temporary charge against Arsenal, just as he had done when Ian Holloway left last year, but could not gain a positive result as Palace were beaten 2-1 at the Emirates Stadium by a stoppage-time goal from Aaron Ramsey.

Palace co-chairman Steve Parish indicated the board are looking for someone with experience of the English top flight, with former Cardiff boss Malky Mackay and ex-Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood thought to be the leading candidates.

Millen will hold further talks with the board on Monday, but understands all too well what a complete change in football philosophy could bring.

He said: 'This is the problem with changing managers. You bring in players to suit the system you play and if you are bringing in a different manager with different philosophies, then maybe they won't suit that.

'With the window shutting at the end of this month, the appointment is important so they have a little bit of time to bring in new players.'

Whatever happens, Millen believes a quick resolution is needed for everyone to look forwards.

'The players will want to know on Monday which direction the club is going. There is a good group there, but they do need leadership,' he said.

'Whoever comes in, it needs to be pretty quick. The longer you leave it then it can start drifting.

'We don't want to be like that and get off to a poor start like last season.'

Millen, who served his apprenticeship as a young player at Palace in the 1980s, hopes he will be considered for the job full-time.

'The circumstances are different now. I felt then (last season) that the situation wasn't right for me,' the 47-year-old former Bristol City boss said.

'I know I can manage - I have done it before. I want to speak to the chairman and see which direction he wants to go in.

'If he has got belief in me, I will speak to him where we want to go with it.

'If he says to me that he's definitely bringing someone else in you get on with it. Hopefully I will be a part of it, so we will just have to wait and see.'
