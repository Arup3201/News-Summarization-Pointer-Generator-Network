The last meal of a new species of marine reptile that lived in the seas during the time of the dinosaurs has been found preserved in a forgotten fossil stored at a museum.

A palaeontologist discovered the 189-million-year-old ichthyosaur while looking through the collections at Doncaster Museum and Art Gallery.

The five foot (1.5 metres) long fossil, which was thought to be a plaster copy, had been kept in storage for nearly 30 years and had been largely overlooked.

The fossilised, which has been named Ichthyosaurus anningae, had lain forgotten about in Doncaster Museum for nearly 30 years. The dark mass between the ribs are the remains of the animals last meal

However, Dean Lomax, a visting scientist at the University of Manchester, noticed some unusual structures in the bone structure while browsing the museum's collection.

Skin pigments preserved in fossils - including an extinct creature that swam the oceans almost 200 million years ago - have been revealed using X-rays.

Scans of the beautifully-preserved marine organisms help paint a picture of the appearance of animals that died out millions of years ago.

Dark traces on fossilised skin from three reptiles - a 55 million-year-old leatherback turtle, an 86-million-year-old mosasaur and a 190 to 196-million-year-old ichthyosaur dating back up to 196 million years - were found to contain melanin.

This pigment is found in many animals and serves various roles, from camouflage to regulation of body temperature.

It suggests the ichthyosaurs had dark skins much like some species of modern dolphin. 

Dr Johan Lindgren and colleagues at Lund University, in Sweden, who conducted the study said evidence of it in these creatures reflects the important evolutionary role melanin played.

They said the pigment was crucial in determining whether such animals were able to live in the colder parts of the world. 

Trapped within the fossilised bones of the ancient reptile, which had a similar shape to modern day dolphins, were also the remains of its last meal - squid.

The finding has shed new light on the diets that these ocean dwelling reptiles lived on and gives new insight into their behaviour.

Squid spend most of their time in the cold, dark depths of the ocean and most modern species that feed on them tend to dive down hundreds of metres to reach them.

According to scientists this suggests that ichthyosaurs may have also been capable of withstanding high pressure and cold temperatures to reach their food.

Working with palaeontologists at the State University of New York, Mr Lomax has now identified the fossil as a new species that was previously unknown to science.

It has been named Ichthyosaurus anningae in honor of the British fossil collector Mary Anning, who first collected ichtyosaurs in the early 1800s.

Mr Lomax said: 'It has taken us seven years of comparing this fossil with other ichthyosaur specimens from around the world to establish that it is a new species.

'Finding the contents of the stomach inside were an added bonus. Most fossils of ichthyosaurs have had their gut contents removed, if there were there, when they were excavated in the early 1800s to make them more aesthetically pleasing.

'In this fossil, however, there is a mass of thousands of tiny hooks - the ends of squid tentacles. We also found a fish scale close to the gut mass too, which could also have been the remains of a meal, although it may have just ended up inside the fossil by accident.'

The fossil was found between Black Ven, near Lyme Regis, and Sea Town on the Dorset Coast in the 1980s

The fossil is the first new species of ichthyosaur to be discovered in around 130 years and is one of the most complete specimens of its age.

It was originally found among the rocks somewhere between Black Ven, near Lyme Regis, and Seatown on the Jurassic Coast of Dorset during the 1980s and bought by Doncaster Museum in 1983.

However, after some staff changes at the museum it was later mistakenly labelled as a plaster cast copy and left to languish in the museums collections.

However, in 2008 Mr Lomax noticed that some of the fin bones appeared to be different from other species of ichthyosaurs he had seen.

Working with Professor Judy Massare from the State University of New York, they compared the fossilised bones with around 1,000 other ichthyosaur remains.

Their findings are published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. 

In their paper they describe the fossil as a new species and say it  lived in the oceans between 189 and 182 million years ago during the early Jurassic period.

The scientists discovered tiny hooks from the end of squid tenticles fossilised in the remains of the reptile

During their search they discovered three other specimens in museums elsewhere in the world that they believe are also of the same species as the fossil in Doncaster.

They were also able to determine that the fossil in Doncaster, which is almost complete apart from the end of its tail, belonged to an adult male. 

The other specimens are thought to be a subadult and two juveniles. 

Mr Lomax said he thought it was the first time it had been possible to determine the sex of fossilised ichthyosaurs.

Ichthyosaurs are an ancient species of marine reptile that are distantly related to turtles as shown above

He said: 'There appears to have been some sexual dimorphism as the humerus bones appear to be different. We examined dimorphism in other reptiles and found this often differs significantly.

'We were able to say the fossil in Doncaster is probably a male adult.'

Ichthyosaurs were once common in the world's oceans and had sharped teeth with which they are thought to have used to snatch fish as they hunted.

Some fossils have been found with the remains of fish preserved inside them.

It is hoped the discovery will encourage other museums to look back through their collections as there could be other new species hidden there.

Dr Silvia Danise from Plymouth University told the BBC: 'Collections are treasures that show their value each time we're able to look at them with a different perspective, and by asking new scientific questions.'
