What's in a name? Not much, it seems, as far as Eurovision chiefs are concerned: they have invited Australia to take part in this year's notionally pan-European singing contest.

Organisers said they are inviting an act from Down Under to be fast-tracked to the final this May in Vienna, in a special move to mark the 60th anniversary of the competition.

Broadcasters hailed the 'historic' move and said it would elevate the show to a 'new global level'.

Eurovision... and beyond: The organisers of the Eurovision Song Contest are to allow Australia to compete in a shock move to mark the 60th anniversary of the notionally pan-European music competition

Jon Ola Sand, executive supervisor of the contest at the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), said: 'It's a daring and at the same time incredibly exciting move. It is our way of saying "let's celebrate this party together".'

Australia has until March 16 to decide who will represent them at the show, which has previously accepted entries from outside Europe but none from so far away.

Although the country's entry will pass straight through to the competition's grand final, Australia will still be allowed to vote in both semi-finals as well.

The country will convene a panel of judges, but organisers are considering a phone in to allow the Australian public to help decide 50 per cent of the votes dished out to other countries.

But there is no chance of the Antipodean entrant will wrest this most-European of institutions to the other side of the world; organisers promise that even if Australia does win it will not host next year's show, as tradition dictates of regular entrants.

Australia's participation is being touted as a one-off initiative to mark the show's anniversary. However, if they do clinch the title they will be allowed to defend their crown.

It is not the first time a country from outside Europe has taken part in Eurovision. Israel, Cyprus and Armenia, in Western Asia, have competed since 1973, 1981 and 2006 respectively; and Morocco, in North Africa, in the 1980 competition alone

Several transcontinental countries with only part of their territory in Europe have also competed: Turkey, since 1975; Russia, since 1994; Georgia, since 2007; and Azerbaijan, which made its first appearance in the 2008 edition.

Lebanon in Western Asia, Tunisia in North Africa and even Qatar, in the heart of the Middle East, have all previously tried to enter Eurovision but ended up not competing after complications.

Michael Ebeid, managing director of broadcaster SBS, which airs the show in Australia, said: 'We are very excited to have secured this historic opportunity for Australia to be represented on the world's biggest stage at the 60th anniversary of the Eurovision Song Contest and are honoured that the European Broadcasting Union has supported us to achieve this ambition.

'SBS has been broadcasting Eurovision for over 30 years and we have seen how Australians' love of the song contest has grown during those years.'

Alexander Wrabetz, director general of host broadcasters ORF, said: 'The song contest has developed in its history to become the biggest TV entertainment event in the world.

'With the participation of Australia, together with our partners at the EBU and SBS, we have succeeded to lift it to a new global level and to build another bridge for the 60th anniversary - a bridge that spans the globe, starting from the heart of Europe.'

Twitter was tonight abuzz with comment on the surprise addition to the Eurovision roster.

'Australia in the Eurovision Song Contest? Anglosphere is just trolling Europe now. Pure humiliation,' wrote Factoria Forex, an account which usually posts investment news in Spanish.

Other users questioned Eurovision chiefs' grip of geography. 'Erm...australia are to compete in the 2015 eurovision song contest?? Seriously...what?? did they confuse it with austria??' wrote one tweeting under the pseudonym No.

Another using the name Ron Jeremy said: 'So Australia are gonna be in the Eurovision song contest, but they're in ummmm okay, yeah f*** it whatever #logic.'

Sam West echoed the notion, saying: 'I can kinda understand how Morocco & Israel have been in the Eurovision Song Contest. But Australia being in it. That is a different story.'

Australians using the microblogging platform seemed pleased with the development. David Moutou gushed: 'Our dream has come true! Australia to compete in #Eurovision this year!'

But others were more guarded. Mike Ticher posted a pictured of Conchita Wurst, the bearded drag queen from Austria, with the comment: 'Australia enters Eurovision. Hope we don't make embarrassingly kitsch spectacle of ourselves.'

Other tweets called for the further extension of Eurovision. Charlie Skelton wrote: 'Australia invited to join #Eurovision? Israel already competes. Time, surely, for Palestine to get the green light.'
