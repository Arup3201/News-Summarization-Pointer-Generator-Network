The BBC's new multi-million pound television news studio has been built to be bomb proof to protect journalists from suicide attacks.

The news room sits in a bunker under the main reception at the £1billion New Broadcasting House.

Staff have been assured they would be protected from a blast should a suicide bomber walk through the front door at the central London facility.

Bunker: The BBC's news room at New Broadcasting House is bomb proof to protect staff from suicide attacks

A BBC source told The Sunday Express: 'It's directly underneath so if a suicide bomber came in the front door they would be right over it. We've been assured it's bomb proof.'

The BBC refused to comment on the claim however, saying: 'We never discuss security issues.'

The news room, described as one of the largest in the world, will go live in March, broadcasting the BBC's three main daily bulletins at 1pm, 6pm and 10pm. The bulletins will undergo a makeover but the source said the changes will be subtle.

But despite licence fee money being spent on the overhaul, there has reportedly been problems with getting the graphics to work, which could delay the launch.

The source said bulletins may have to continue to be broadcast from Television Centre in White City while the glitches are ironed out, and added: 'It will obviously cost money to run two control rooms'.

However, the BBC has denied this claim and said everything is 'running on schedule'.

A spokesperson for the Corporation also said it 'never discusses security issues'.

The news room, which includes a large LCD display screen dubbed a 'graphics halo' will be in view of the cameras behind a glass partion and journalists have been warned to be on their best behaviour.

The insider added: 'They must keep their desks clear, no jackets on chairs and no eating.'

New Broadcasting House has been funded by a 30-year bond deal and the Corporation says it will deliver savings of £750 million over the same period.

It will open for public tours in April, having been more than 10 years in the making, and will be home to around 5,000 staff.

It has included the refurbishment of the original Broadcasting House, which has been the home of BBC radio since 1932.

BBC Spokesperson: 'New Broadcasting House provides new studios, new operating systems and new technology.

'New TV studios give us the opportunity to refresh the look and feel of our news programmes including updating captions and graphics, but the titles and overall BBC News brand that viewers have come to recognise and love including the globe and BBC News logos are not changing'.
