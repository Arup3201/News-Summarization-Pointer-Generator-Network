Jesse Zorski, who works as a tailor in the fashion industry, was struck on the left leg by a NYPD patrol car on the night of April 12.

The impact sent Zorski flying into the side-view mirror, then onto the ground, where he landed on his wrist.

He wasn’t badly hurt, but after brief treatment at New York Downtown Hospital, faced medical expenses of $1,200.

Insult and injury: Jesse Zorski was hospitalized by a police car and then expected to pay for it

His family paid up but then pursued legal claims against the city to reclaim the money.

As reported in the New York Daily News,
Zorski maintains that he had a green light for the crosswalk on Centre 
Street and White Street in Lower Manhattan when he was hit by the police
car.

He states that 
he had drank two beers that evening and uses a hearing aid after a 
childhood illness, but neither of these factors had any part to play in 
the incident.

‘I was perfectly coherent. I was shocked, certainly, but not inebriated,’ Zorski said.

But the NYPD also claim that their 
vehicle had the right of way.

And, shortly after the Zorski family began
proceedings, Jesse received a nasty surprise in the mail.

A letter from a legal firm hired by the police department claimed 
$1,028.08 for damages to the patrol car.

The missive also threatened that failure 
to address the matter would result in the filing of a lawsuit.

The Zorski family are convinced that this letter was in response to their own legal challenge.

After the story was highlighted by the Daily News, New York police have admitted that the bill was sent in error.

Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne stated: ‘The letter should not have 
been sent. We’re examining safeguards to make sure similar letters are 
not sent in the future.’

Yet this is not the first time the NYPD 
have added insult to (sometimes fatal) injury in 2012 alone. In September, the
same law firm sent a demand for $710, to be paid within ten days, to a 
man who was killed in a police chase.

As the New York Times
reported at the time, this bill was opened by a grieving mother, who 
was ‘humiliated’ that her son was sent a letter ‘for the car that killed
him’.
