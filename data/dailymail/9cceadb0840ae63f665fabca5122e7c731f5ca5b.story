A speeding teenage driver who killed his best friend after crashing his high-powered hatchback a month after passing his test has been jailed for three years.

Michael Lock, 19, of Colchester, Essex, had been driving at an estimated 55mph, almost twice the 30mph speed limit, when he lost control of his Citroen Saxo VTR.

His friend Josh Irvine, 18, who had been a passenger in the car, died instantly when the car collided into a road-sweeper in Bromley Road, Colchester.

Lock had passed his test a month before the incident after taking an intensive learning course, the court heard.

He was told he would serve at least 18 
months in a young offenders' institution after he admitted causing death
 by dangerous driving.

Josh's parents, Patrick and Tracey Irvine, last night said that not even a 100-year jail sentence would bring back their only child.

Mr Irvine also branded 'hot hatchbacks' as loaded guns ready to go off.

Lock and Josh Irvine had been friends since they met at secondary school at the age of 11 and worked together at Lock’s family business, run by his father, Chelmsford Crown Court heard.

Lock suffered serious injuries in the incident, on November 8, 2012, and had to spend more than six weeks in hospital as he was treated for multiple fractures, including his jaw, collarbone, eye socket and cheekbone.

Sentencing Lock, Judge John Dodd, QC, said: 'The circumstances are tragic.

'You were seen by a number of people in 
the moments before the fatal impact and the common perception is that 
you were travelling far in excess of the limit, and one or two of those were indeed fearful there would be a dreadful incident.

'You chose to drive far too fast in a vehicle which for you was too powerful. You have expressed profound remorse and I accept you are a decent hard-working young man.

'You never intended any harm to befall Josh that fateful day.'

He added: 'You have been traumatised at the realisation that for the sake of a few moments of excitement you have destroyed Josh’s life and changed forever the life of his family and friends.

'That is a heavy burden for you to bear and that is punishment itself. I am acutely conscious no sentence I can pass can begin to ease the pain of this on those who have suffered and will continue to.

'I hope this terrible incident will cause other young people, other inexperienced drivers, to act with care in the future.'

The teenager, of Colchester Essex, had been driving at an estimated 55mph, almost twice the 30mph speed limit, when he lost control of the Citroen Saxo VTR in Bromley Road, Colchester

Lock was also banned from driving for six years and must pass an extended test before he is allowed back behind the wheel.

A victim impact statement from Mr and Mrs Irvine read to the court hailed Josh as 'a very special young man, kind, caring, sensitive, generous and thoughtful who touched everyone he met and made a lasting impression'.

Judge Dodd added: 'He was plainly a fine young man of whom they were rightly very proud.'

Speaking after the hearing, Mr Irvine, of
 Colchester, said: 'Even if the judge had passed a 100-year sentence I 
would not be happy.

'You have been traumatised at the 
realisation that for the sake of a few moments of excitement you have 
destroyed Josh’s life and changed forever the life of his family and 
friends'

- Judge John Dodd, QC

'Our lives ended that day. We’re just getting through day by day and today was a long time in coming - 588 days since the crash.

'Someone getting into a "hot hatchback" is like a bullet in the chamber ready to go off.'

Mrs Irvine said: 'We would much rather our son be with us, and to new drivers I would say "You are not invincible".'

Det Sgt Damon Bainbridge, of Essex Police, said: 'We hope that Michael Lock uses the opportunity he has now given behind bars to contemplate his actions and learn from his mistake.

'Lock underwent an intensive driving lesson course and after only a matter of days sat and passed his driving test.

'The young man’s parents then bought him a sporty car at some expense. This was foolish and we urge parents to consider the make, model and power of car they buy their children.

'These newly-qualified drivers should only be behind the wheel of vehicles which they can easily control. They have limited experience of being on the road and are in charge of what is a potentially lethal weapon.'
