A senior columnist at the New York Times has openly questioned whether former BBC boss Mark Thompson is fit for his new post running America’s most prestigious newspaper in the wake of the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal.

Mr Thompson has denied knowledge of a BBC cover-up and vowed to take up his role in New York as planned next month.

But in a column, Joe Nocera questioned his explanation of his role in the affair: ‘Thompson winds up appearing wilfully ignorant, and it makes you wonder what kind of an organisation the BBC was when he was running it. It also makes you wonder what kind of chief executive he’d be at the Times.’

‘Thompson winds up appearing willfully ignorant, and it makes you wonder what kind of an organization the BBC was when Thompson was running it — and what kind of leader he was. It also makes you wonder what kind of chief executive he’d be at The Times,’ wrote Mr Nocera.

It comes as day after it was alleged that Mr Thompson's office was twice alerted to claims that Savile was a child abuser.

In May and again in September, his aides were told of allegations that the late television presenter had molested youngsters on BBC premises.

But on both occasions, a spokesman for the ex-director general insisted, the claims were not passed on to him.

Mr Nocera, a business and finance columnist writing for the flagship paper’s Op-Ed page, said Mr Thompson’s nameplate is already on his office door.

‘Yet since early October,’ he added, ‘all anybody has asked about Thompson are those two most damning of questions: what did he know, and when did he know it?’

Mr Nocera said the BBC ‘plainly’ did cover up Savile’s wrongdoing.

‘What is far less certain is how high the cover-up went,’ he continued. ‘Thompson first said that he never heard the rumors about Savile, and that he didn’t learn about the “Newsnight” programme until after it was cancelled. Given the byzantine nature of the BBC bureaucracy, these are plausible denials.

‘Here is where it gets a little less plausible. Thompson now says that at a cocktail party last December, a BBC reporter said to him, “You must be worried about the ‘Newsnight’ investigation into Jimmy Savile.”

Soon thereafter, Thompson asked his underlings about the investigation and was told that it had been killed — for journalistic reasons. He claims to have inquired no further, not even to ask what the investigation was about.

‘A few months later, the news broke in the British press that the BBC had, as The Daily Mail put it in a headline, “shelved Jimmy Savile sex abuse investigation ‘to protect its own reputation.’ ”

‘Given the seriousness of sexual abuse allegations — look at what it did to Penn State — you would think that Thompson and his underlings would immediately want to get to the bottom of it. But, again, they did nothing.’

Mr Thompson, 55, has made it clear he has the full support of his new bosses.

‘I do not believe there is anything that I've done in relation to this matter which should in anyway impinge on my abilities to fully discharge the responsibilities I'll have at the New York Times,’ he insisted in an interview last week.

But the columnist claimed that New York Times chairman and publisher Arthur Sulzberger is ‘in a difficult spot.’

‘He believes strongly that he’s got the executive he needs to lead The Times to the promised land of healthy profits again,’ he wrote.

‘Although he declined to be interviewed for this column, he appears to have accepted Thompson’s insistence that he knew nothing about the explosive allegations that became public literally 50 days after he accepted the Times job. Sulzberger is backing his man unreservedly.

‘For the sake of Times employees — not to mention the readers who want to see a vibrant New York Times Company — let’s hope his faith in Thompson is warranted.

‘Otherwise, the BBC won’t be the only organization being asked tough questions about its judgment.’
