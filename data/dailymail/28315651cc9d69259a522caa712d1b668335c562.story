For a manager with a reputation for caution, it seemed a very odd decision to leave out Ashley Cole and plump for a teenager with one cap.

Even as Roy Hodgson tried to explain his reasons he did not seem convinced, and yet nobody will have paid more attention to these two left backs set on radically different trajectories.

Luke Shaw, at 18, is rising at a breathtaking rate, a seemingly unstoppable force scouted by every top club in Europe. Cole is fading.

Changing of the guard: Luke Shaw will go to the World Cup ahead of long-time left back Cole

In public, Jose Mourinho has been ultra-supportive of a man who has served him loyally. The Chelsea manager has tried his best to credit Cesar Azpilicueta rather than find fault with Cole, but the Cole of old is not replaced at left back by a right back. No more than the Cole of old is replaced at international level by Leighton Baines. No more than the Cole of old spends half an hour struggling to contain Cardiff’s Mats Daehli.

Cole’s form has slipped from its very high standards. It is a trend that started last year and continued into this, amplified by the damaged confidence which comes from losing your aura of invincibility. Mourinho and Hodgson have agreed on this.

That does not mean he is a spent force. Cole remains a fine player and an attractive free transfer, but Chelsea’s defenders have all been impressive within Mourinho’s strong unit. If he had played left back at Everton this season, the physical limitations of a  33-year-old with delicate ankles would have been more severely tested.

Mourinho wants his full backs to defend, not bomb on, and protects them with midfield enforcers in Ramires and Nemanja Matic. Hodgson will want more from his left back, but tactical deliberations are beside the point. Cole has lost his World Cup place because he was not good enough to keep his Chelsea place. By the time he returned in late April, the England manager’s mind was made up.

Where next? Ashley Cole is resigned to leaving Chelsea this summer as his contract ends

During Cole’s absence, Hodgson studied Shaw and became convinced he was ready for international football.

His emergence also fits into a broader philosophy which can serve England well.

Hodgson wants to do well at the World Cup but expectations are low and he can start to extend his vision, because failing to reach Euro 2016 in France looks almost impossible given England’s group.

Here is a rare luxury. Hodgson can start by enveloping the best of the young players into the framework and giving them time to train together and play together.

At the same time, Shaw and Baines are exciting players. They are quite capable of rewarding the England manager for discarding his cloak of caution.
