The shipwrecked Costa Concordia cruise liner made its final journey yesterday arriving in the northern Italian city of Genoa where it will be scrapped.

Pulled by tugboats for 200 miles and nudged by winds, the ship was eased into the port.

It took five days for the liner to reach the headquarters of ship owner Costa Crociere Spa where the luxury vessel first set sail after construction in 2005.

Thirty-two people were killed when the ship ran aground in the seas near the Tuscan island of Giglio in 2012, making it the worst maritime disaster since the Second World War.

Meanwhile, the captain has provoked anger as pictures emerged of him reportedly 'celebrating' a book deal at a publisher's exclusive VIP party on the holiday island of Ischia.

Transported: The Italian cruise liner Costa Concordia sits today inside Genoa's Voltri Port, Italy. Thirty-two people died onboard when the ship ran aground in 2012

Docked: The wreckage of the Costa Concordia liner arrived near the northern Italian city of Genoa following a 200-mile towing operation

At port in Genoa: The Costa Concordia dismantling operations are predicted to last two years

It's here: The cruise liner was made floating again on July 14, 30 months after the cruise ship hit a reef and partly capsized off the island of Giglio in January 2012

The salvage operation for the ship - pictured as it is towed to Genoa today - is expected to be a long and expensive process that will take two years and cost 1.5billion euros

The ship's
 captain Francesco Schettino has been a figure of ridicule and contempt 
since the accident, and local media suggested he was celebrating a book 
deal at the party.

He
 is currently on trial for manslaughter, with it alleged he performed a 
'salute' to the island as he tried to impress his Moldovan lover - a 
former dancer who worked as a hostess on the ship.

Local newspaper Il Golfo
 published the images, showing a tanned and happy-looking Schettino 
socialising at Italian publisher Pietro Graus's annual 'White Party'.

The Sunday Telegraph reported Mr Graus defended inviting Schettino to his party.

'The commander was invited to the event that I organise every year for my publishing house,' he said.

The Costa Concordia, a huge floating hotel as long as three football pitches laid end to end, with 13 passenger decks, was carrying some 4,000 passengers and crew when it went down shortly after the start of a Mediterranean cruise

As much of the country watched on as the wreckage of the ship, where 32 people died, was towed north, Capt Schettino was attending a VIP party in Ischia

Four tugboats and several escort ships were lined up to tow the 114,000-tonne vessel to Genoa after the most daunting salvage operation ever attempted

'I have a 
duty to transfer all the pain, the anger of a man who has always had 
before him the silent and endless horizons of the sea.'

Twitter users were quick express their condemnation of the captain.

One wrote: 'The party organized by the editor @GrausEditore who wanted #Schettino as guest star. Pure disgust.'

Even
 former tennis professional Angelo Mangiante weighed in on the debate, 
tweeting: '32 dead, 110 injured. And he, still #Schettino on vacation 
guest of honor among the VIPs of Ischia. I am ashamed of this Italy.'

The
 wreckage of the 114,500-tonne Costa Concordia was lifted off the rocks 
and re-floated last week in preparation for its trip north where it will
 be salvaged for scrap.

Prime 
Minister Matteo Renzi is expected in Genoa later today to hail the 
completion of the operation which restored some pride to Italy after a 
disaster that was widely interpreted as a national humiliation as well 
as a human tragedy.

In
 contrast to the calamitous night of Jan. 13, 2012, when the Concordia 
came too close to shore during a display sometimes performed by cruise 
ships known as a 'salute', the salvage operation has been a resounding 
technical success.

'This
 is not a celebration. We have to think of the victims, but it has to be
 said that keeping the Concordia in Italy is a great occasion for our 
country,' Environment Minister Gian Luca Galletti told reporters at the 
port.

'We have excellent technology and we are capable of undertaking great things,' he said.

The
 overall salvage effort is expected to cost Carnival Corp, owner of the 
ship's operator, Costa Cruises and its insurers more than 1.5billion 
euros.

The captain of the ship is currently on trial for manslaughter - which he denies - after it is alleged he attempted a manoeuvre to show off to his mistress who was aboard the boat

Environmentalists were concerned the ship could split as it left port or during the four day voyage north, however it appears to have reached its destination intact

The arrival of the stricken luxury cruise liner created a stir in Genoa, with dozens heading down to the beaches, or their balconies, to catch a glimpse of it
