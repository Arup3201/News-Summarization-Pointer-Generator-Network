Domestic violence charges against NBA player Jared Sullinger have been dropped because his girlfriend refused to testify against him.

The Boston Celtics big man was arrested after allegedly pinning Deann Smith to the bed before throwing her to the floor of their townhouse on August 31. He also allegedly smashed her phone so she couldn't call police.

But the charges were dismissed in court today after Smith invoked her Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination.

According to the Boston Globe, Sullinger’s attorney, Charles Rankin, asked Waltham District Court to drop the charges due to a lack of evidence.

Rankin wrote that Smith, through her attorney, notified Middlesex District Attorney Marian T. Ryan’s office that she would invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if called as a prosecution witness.

'Moreover, discovery in the case has revealed there are not excited utterances nor any other admissible evidence to support the charges,' Rankin wrote.

In domestic violence cases, prosecutors can cite what a victim tells first responders - 'excited utterances' - when they refuse to testify against their alleged abusers.

Asked after the outcome how he was feeling, Sullinger said, 'Ready to play.'

In September, Sullinger pleaded not guilty to assault and battery, destruction of property and witness intimidation.

But SB Nation reported prosecutors pushed to convict Sullinger, even though the victim wanted the charges dropped.

Sullinger described his arrest as 'humbling and embarrassing' in a statement released by the Celtics.

'I
know that this situation has brought both sorrow and embarrassment to 
my girlfriend, my family, the Boston Celtics organization, my teammates,
and my fans,' he said. 'To all of you, I apologize from the bottom of 
my heart.'
