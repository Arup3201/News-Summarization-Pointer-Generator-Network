Jamelia Humphreys was found guilty of head-butting a 10 year old girl who was able to identify her attacker after seeing her on the programme

A tearaway star of Channel 4 documentary ‘Skint’ headbutted a ten-year-old girl - but was caught because her victim recognised her from the telly.

Jobless Jamelia Humphreys - a teenage mother who had her own baby taken from her by social services - attacked the child whilst she was appearing every week on television.

Foul-mouthed Humphreys, 18, was asked to curb her language several times by security guards at court, also pleaded guilty to stealing £7 worth of condoms from a pharmacy, in her hometown of Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire.

Humphreys, who was 16 when Skint was filmed, is now barred from entering Scunthorpe town centre.

Wayward Humphreys, who is waiting to be sentenced for these offences and also for assaulting a woman police officer, said outside court: 'I wish I’d never appeared on Skint now, it’s like everyone knows my business and who I am.

'It’s like I’m the Queen’s daughter or something, but I’m not no [sic] princess.'

Humphreys, who turned 18 just three weeks ago, was before magistrates frequently as a juvenile.

Humphreys arrived at North Lincolnshire Magistrates’ Court 1hr 40min late for her 2pm hearing because she had lost her phone the previous day, and said: 'I just forgot I had to be at court, I mean, I can’t be expected to remember everything.'

She had fled the court at an earlier trial where she was found guilty of head-butting the ten-year-old girl on 31 May. A warrant was issued for her arrest and she was re-bailed for Thursday’s appearance.

On that occasion magistrates’ heard from the victim, who was forced to come to court to give evidence on her 11th birthday.

Wayward Humphreys, who is waiting to be sentence, appeared on the programme when she was only 16 

Outlining the case, prosecutor Marie Harpin said the incident took place in Scunthorpe.

She
said: 'The complainant was stood with her friend when the defendant got
out of a car and asked one girl whether she was being bullied.

'The defendant turned on the group and became abusive before accusing the complainant of smirking.

'She then headbutted her on the right side of her forehead.

'She began to cry and then ran home.'

The headbutt left the girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, with red marks on her forehead and a lump.

The controversial programme was screened in May and June of this year. 

Dubbed the real-life version of Shameless, in which Frank Gallagher fiddles his benefits and spends all his money on drugs and alcohol – Skint shocked viewers with its examination of a housing estate.

Skint was a controversial documentary charting life on the Westcliffe estate, where crime, drugs and poverty are rife, promised social insight shot through with coarse humour.

But there was nothing funny about the portrait of badly broken Britain.

The youngsters talking to the cameras saw life as vicious, joyless and funded by state handouts.

Those who are often maligned for their lifestyle offered their own story and show the real impact of unemployment.

The police interview with the 10-year-old victim was played out in court.

She said: 'I was walking home with my friends and this girl called Jamelia off the TV came out of a car and asked another girl (in a different group) if we were bullying her and she said "yes".

'Then Jamelia said to all of us that ‘I am going to slap every single one of you’.

'Then Jamelia said to my friend that if she touched this girl then she is going to come to me (Jamelia) and I am going to touch you all to see how you like it.

'She thought I was laughing and asked me how I would like it if she hit me so she stood up and went like that.'

The girl indicated to the officer that Humphreys headbutted her.

She said that her attacker issued further threats to her.

Asked how she felt after the incident, the complainant said: 'I was very upset.

'It made me feel really scared and not want to go out on the street again. I am really sad when I think about it and it makes me upset.

'When she sees me again face-to-face I think that she might hurt me.'

She said on a scale of one to 10, the pain she felt was a nine.

Chris Dickens, representing Humphreys said the defence case was that his client was not present at the scene and did not assault the girl.

Scunthorpe Magistrates' Court heard how the teenager's victim felt scared and not want to go out on the street again after the attack

Mr Dickens said to the young girl: 'I have been told by Jamelia that she said she was not there on that day. Could you be confused?'

The girl replied: 'No.'

Mr Dickens added: 'You knew her from the TV programme Skint?'

She again replied: 'Yes.'

The court heard Humphreys had previous convictions for battery - twice in 2009, in 2010 and in 2012.

In 2009 the court heard she argued with a female before punching her in the face.

Later in year, she grabbed the complainant by the hair, pulled her back before kicking her in the head several times.

In 2010 she had a further conviction for battery in which she hit the complainant several times.

Then in 2012 she had another offence of battery when she kicked, punched and stamped on another person.

At Thursday’s hearing Humphreys pleaded guilty to the theft of condoms, worth £7, from Weldrake Pharmacy on 27 May.

On 25 July she also attacked a WPC as she executed her duties.

Magistrates adjourned sentencing for the preparation of a probation report, and granted Humphreys bail on the conditions that she does not contact her ten-year-old victim or another named child and does not enter the town centre.

She will be sentenced on September 13.
