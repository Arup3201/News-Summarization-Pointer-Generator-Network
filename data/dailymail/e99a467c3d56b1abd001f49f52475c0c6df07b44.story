Parents and independent schools should stop being ‘sniffy’ about vocational qualifications and assuming university is the automatic route after A-levels, a leading headteacher has said.

Hilary French, the headmistress of Central Newcastle High School, said employers were increasingly demanding skills that were of genuine use in the work place.

The cost of taking a degree and the introduction of low-cost online higher education courses added to the need to consider ‘alternative avenues’.

The comments will surprise many parents who can spend tens of thousands a year sending their children to private schools in the hope they will go on to win a place at a top university.

But Mrs French, the president of the Girls’ Schools Association, told delegates at the organisation’s annual conference: ‘I predict that we’re going to see the focus shift away from university as the automatic first choice next step for those who are in the fortunate position of being able to weigh up the pros and cons of alternative pathways after sixth form and a move instead to employment skills and training while working.’

She added: ‘Increasingly, we - teachers, parents and girls - will need to be open-minded about what further and higher education looks like.

‘I believe and hope that the link between schools and employers will strengthen over the coming years and that there will be an increasing focus on developing employment skills.

Hands on: Hilary French said that independent schools must embrace alternative routes to employment - such as apprenticeships (library image)

‘I’d like to challenge independent schools heads to embrace these alternative avenues. Parents too.

‘There is a huge potential in employer training courses and the new types of apprenticeships which are emerging. We must not be sniffy about them.’

The number of higher apprenticeships - designed for people with good A-level or equivalent qualifications - has soared, going up 147 per cent between 2009 and 2012.

At the same time the proportion of school leavers entering higher education has gone up, to a record 49 per cent in 2011-2012.

Business Secretary Vince Cable last week criticised the ‘qualification inflation’ that meant degrees had become a minimum entry requirement in many jobs, including nursing and accountancy.

The government was trying to persuade professional associations to ‘relax their qualifications’, he said.

Mrs French also used her speech in Newcastle-upon-Tyne yesterday to attack successive governments’ obsession with curriculum and exam reforms in state schools, saying they were not the way to bring about social change.

Schools were being turned into ‘exam factories’, she warned, leaving children ‘dehumanised’.

‘Soft skills’ such as resilience, leadership, integrity, compassion and adaptability also needed to be taught, as well as the ability to ‘filter ideas’ as children are now ‘bombarded’ with so much information and data.

In a further attack on the maintained system, she said healthy pursuits such as outdoor play, school allotments and taking part in the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award scheme were seen as ‘extra-curricular’ activities that had become ‘largely the preserve of independent schools’.

‘Many students graduate without any integrated sense of the unity of things,’ Mrs French said.

‘Independent schools, however, have the advantage of being just that - independent - and have always been good at educating what they call “the whole person”.’
