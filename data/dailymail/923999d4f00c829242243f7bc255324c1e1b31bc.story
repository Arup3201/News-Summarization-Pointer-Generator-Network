Drunk: Simon Stansfield (pictured) was responsible for telling the driver when it was safe to depart

A train conductor who was so drunk he got out of the carriage and was left stranded on a station platform has avoided jail.

The train that Simon Stansfield was responsible for made it 15 miles - from Dundee to Carnoustie - before the driver was alerted to his absence.

The packed Inverurie-bound train then had to return to Dundee from the Angus town to pick up the guard - who was three times the legal alcohol limit and was still on the platform.

Dundee Sheriff Court was told by fiscal depute Ross Cargill that Stansfield was responsible for telling the driver when it was safe to depart.

He was also in charge of passenger safety and for operating the system to lock the doors and deactivate the braking system, the court heard.

Mr Cargill said Stansfield was working on the ScotRail 4.38pm service on November 19 when the 
driver thought he heard a buzzer sounding indicating it was safe to 
leave and heard the braking system being released before moving the 
train forward.

The prosecutor added: 'As the train departed, the accused was left on the station platform.

'Mr Cox, the station supervisor, was approached by Mr Stansfield and 
told what had happened. The driver was contacted and stopped the train.

'While speaking to Mr Stansfield, Mr Cox smelled alcohol on his breath and contacted the controller.

'The British Transport Police were contacted and Mr Stansfield was breathalysed.

'He said he had last had a drink at 10am that morning.'

Mr Cargill said 
the breathalyser showed a preliminary reading of 110 mics of alcohol.

Stansfield was taken to police HQ in Dundee where a blood test revealed a level of 120 mics.

Stansfield, 45, Dundee, pleaded guilty to a charge 
that, being a person who works on a transport system and who controlled 
the movement of a vehicle, he worked with excess alcohol in his system.

The court heard he had 120 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres breath - more than three times the limit of 35.

Alan Lyle, defending, said Stansfield had no idea how the doors of the 
train had managed to lock with him still standing on the platform.

He said: 'He pressed two buttons to close the doors except the one where he would get on.

'He was looking along the train to ensure the hazard lights were off and
as he was about to get back on the train the doors closed.

'It is his position that he did nothing to make them close and doesn't know why they started to.

'He started to walk along to see the driver and at that the train started to pull away, leaving him on the platform.

'He has resigned from his position and has seen his GP to address his alcohol problem.

'He's very ashamed of the position that he finds himself in.'

Sheriff 
Richard Davidson said a drunk conductor was 'not a novel situation for 
Scotrail' - referring to the 2008 case of Thomas Gracie, who was found 
slumped in the cab of the train after passengers were unable to alight 
at Edinburgh Waverley station.

Sheriff Davidson fined Stansfield Â£1,000 and said: 'The public have
to be confident that they can get on a train and it will operate 
safely.

'The way Scotrail operate is that there is a driver and a conductor who are to be compos mentis.

'On that day you were in such a bad way for drink that you could not possibly carry out the requirements of your office.

'As such to some extent the public were placed at risk by your state and that's completely unacceptable.'
