Roy Hodgson believes future generations of England players could benefit from pursuing their club careers abroad.

Chelsea's Josh McEachran agreed a season-long loan with Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem this week and Hodgson is convinced it is in the interests of more young stars to consider a future on the continent.

Hodgson told thefa.com: 'We are going to have to accept that some young players - who I think are good enough and can win games for England - will not always be first choice for their teams in England.

'It wouldn't hurt them at all to go abroad. Most of our players, although they don't all play regularly - play at very good clubs at a very high level.'

He added: 'If you are asking me would it be better for some of our players to be playing in good teams abroad rather than warming the bench, then of course as a national team manager I would like to see that.'

The then Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster was the only member of England's final 23-man squad for the 2014 World Cup to be based outside the Premier League.

Previously, David Beckham and Owen Hargreaves - who were based at Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively - were picked for the 2006 squad from abroad.

But Hodgson is hopeful that the move by England Under-21 midfielder McEachran could be the start of a trend which sees young prospects pick regular first team football abroad over often bit-part roles at home.

Hodgson added: 'It is not my job to tell players what to do but I would think that, if the opening was there for players to go abroad, then a lot of them would take it.

'Chelsea have a lot of young players and they send them to Vitesse Arnhem. Manchester City have a lot of farm clubs.'

But Hodgson appeared to concede that the introduction of some kind of quota system which restricts the number of foreign players available to each top-flight club is likely to be a non-starter.

Hodgson added: 'National team managers would welcome anything that would protect their players from foreign player invasion but whether the Premier League or the Bundesliga will bring in rules that restrict foreigners then I'm not sure.'
