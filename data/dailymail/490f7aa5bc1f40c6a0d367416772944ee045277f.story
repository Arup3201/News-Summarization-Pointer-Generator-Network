They were a species of early human thought to have roamed Europe and Asia for up to 300,000 years before finally dying out.

Now scientists believe they have ruled out one of the major theories for what triggered the extinction of the Neanderthals.

They have found that an enormous volcanic eruption in Italy 40,000 years ago had little impact on the species' demise.

Neanderthals, shown above from the TV series Walking with Neanderthals, were already on the decline by the time of the Campanian Ignimbrite eruption in Italy 40,000 years ago caused widespread climate cooling

Although the Campanian Ignimbrite eruption was one of the largest volcanic explosions in Europe, scientists say the cooling and increased levels of acid rain that resulted from the explosive eruption would have had little impact in the areas where Neanderthals were living.

They argue that Neanderthal populations had already started to decline by the time the volcano erupted and it was insufficient to trigger their extinction.

Neanderthals may have created and worn the world's first jewellery 130,000 years ago, according to scientists.

Researchers examining eight talons taken from a white-tailed eagle found at Krapina in Croatia say they were used to create necklace or bracelet.

The claws bear multiple cut marks, notches and signs that they had been polishing by the Neanderthals that once inhabited the site where they were found.

Anthropologists at the University Kansas say the talons appear to have been made into symbolic jewellery 80,000 years before modern humans arrived in Europe.

The findings add to mounting evidence that Neanderthals were not the slow-witted and primitive creatures they are often portrayed as. 

Instead they say that it was likely to be competition with modern humans that led to the demise of the Neanderthals.

Dr Benjamin Black, from the department of earth sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, who led the research, said: 'Radiocarbon dating has shown that at the time of the Campanian Ignimbrite eruption, anatomically modern humans had already arrived in Europe, and the range of Neanderthals had steadily diminished. 'Work at five sites in the Mediterranean indicates that anatomically modern humans were established in these locations by then as well.'

Anthropologists have for decades debated the possible causes for the extinction of Neanderthals around 40,000 years ago.

The species first appeared around 400,000 years ago and spread throughout much of Europe and Asia.

Some scientists have suggested that the species were killed off by modern humans - Homo sapiens - as they moved out of Africa or were unable to cope changes to the climate.

However, others have proposed that the explosive eruption of a volcano close to what is now modern day Naples threw millions of tonnes of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere that could have led to the final extinction of the Neanderthals.

Recent research by scientists at the ANO Laboratory of Prehistory in St. Petersburg, Russia has helped support this view.

Mount Vesuvius, which is part of the Campi Flegrei super volcano, still overshadows the city of Naples (above)

The huge crater left by this super-volcano, known as Campi Flegrei, can still be seen on the coastline of Italy on the opposite side of Naples to Mount Vesuvius.

However, Dr Black and his colleagues, whose work is published in the journal Geology, used computer modelling to simulate the impact this enormous eruption would have had on the area at the time.

More than 150 cubic kilometers of magma was thrown out by the eruption.

The sulphur dioxide would have acted like an aerosol, blanketing the area with a layer in the atmosphere that reflected sunlight back into space.

They were big, brutish and probably not particularly good-looking. Now it seems that Neanderthals had to contend with an ailment that affected their appearance too - psoriasis.

Genetic research on Neanderthal remains has shown that these now extinct ancient cousins of modern humans may have suffered from psoriasis.

The research has also revealed that they may have suffered from other modern medical disorders such as Crohn's disease, a condition that affects the digestive system.

Neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred, meaning Europeans now have roughly two per cent Neanderthal DNA.

These 'legacy' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history.

However, some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases.

Scientists have found that part of our HLA system, which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body, could have come from Neanderthals.

Other researchers have suggested that humans outside Africa are more vulnerable to Type 2 Diabetes because they interbred with Neanderthals.

Researchers from Oxford and Plymouth universities have also found that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer were present in the Neanderthal genome.

A gene that can cause diabetes in Latin Americans is also thought to have come from Neanderthals, long before their ancestors colonised the New World.

The researchers found that the largest temperature decreases would have occurred in eastern Europe and Asia, avoiding the areas where the last Neanderthals populations were surviving in western Europe.

They say that the eruption was 'probably insufficient' to trigger the Neanderthal extinction.

However, they say that the cold weather that followed the eruption would still have impacted the day-to day life of Neanderthals and early humans in Europe.

they estimate that temperatures in western Europe fell by an average of two to four degrees C in the year following the eruption.

Dr Black and his colleagues said: 'Significant volcanic cooling during the years immediately following the eruption could have impacted the viability of already precarious populations and influenced many aspects of daily life for Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans.'

Huge volcanic eruption has been blamed for the demise of Neanderthals 

@highlight

Scientists at University of California Berkeley modeled the eruption impact 

@highlight

They found the eruption in Italy cooled Europe's climate by 2-4 degrees C

@highlight

However, researchers say there was less cooling where Neanderthals lived

@highlight

This suggests the eruption did not play a role in the demise of the species

Competition with modern humans was most likely candidate, say scientists
