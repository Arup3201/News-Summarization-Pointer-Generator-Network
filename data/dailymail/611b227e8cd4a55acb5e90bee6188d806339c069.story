James Mathison, host of soon-to-be axed Channel 10 breakfast show, Wake Up, is the first of those hit by the sweeping cuts to Channel 10 to respond publicly. His message: I need a drink.

'Scotch anyone? Scotchy, scotch, scotch, down in my belly,' tweeted Mathison who would have been in need of a stiff drink after the day he has had.

Channel Ten announced sweeping cuts to the network, including  axing its breakfast show Wake Up, early, morning and late news bulletins, resulting in the loss of up to 150 jobs.

Dismal ratings: Ten's breakfast show Wake Up has been cancelled after it suffered its worst week of ratings since it launched in November

Wake Up was launched in November 2013, in a bid to compete with Channel Seven's Sunrise and Channel Nine's Today and rumours have been circulating for weeks that the struggling show might be about to get the chop.

Channel 10 staff were informed of the cuts today, though the extent of the redundancies are not yet known.

Ten CEO Hamish McLennan informed his staff of the cuts in an email this morning.

'It is a tough period for Ten and we need to take some painful, but necessary, measures to restructure the business,' the email to staff said.

'Unfortunately, it is proposed that Wake Up and the Early, Morning and Late News will cease production on Friday, May 23, 2014. Studio 10 is performing well and will continue as a vital part of our daytime schedule, which ranks number one.'

He concluded the email saying: 'The next few weeks will be a difficult and sad period, as colleagues leave the business.'

Channel 10 CEO Hamish McLennan informed staff today that the breakfast show Wake Up and some news bulletins will be axed. It is rumoured that up to 150 jobs will be cut

As well as Wake Up, the struggling network will also cut its 5.30am, 11am, and 10.30pm news bulletins, though it will continue to produce the 5pm news bulletin.

A source at Channel 10 told MailOnline that seven journalists had been fired already, and only five camera-people were to be kept on to cover news in Sydney.

'Bureaus in LA and London have gone,' she added.

The source also confirmed that the morning news bulletin, which runs during the Studio 10 program, would remain in some form, though there was confusion as to who would be responsible for its production.

'We don't have our Studio 10 news bulletin in that news won't be doing it, but it's still up in the air how it will work, so we might just have to be self sufficient with it,' she said.

The Sydney Morning Herald reported there was confusion among Channel 10 employees about how the cuts would affect local news bulletins.

From Friday, 23 May, there will be no more Wake Up breakfast show on Channel 10.

The Early, 5.30am, Morning, 11am and Late, 10.30pm, news bulletins will also not exist.

The 5pm bulletin will remain on air and will be produced locally in each state.

The morning talk show Studio 10 will also continue to be produced

There will be 150 job losses at Channel 10.

There is speculation that seven journalists have reportedly been fired already, and only five camera-people are to be kept on to cover news in Sydney.

It is thought news bureaus in London and Los Angeles have also been shut down.

And it is rumoured that Wake Up might be replaced by a revamped version of Good Morning Australia, with Kerri-Anne Kennerley named as a possible host.

They reported that one source said Channel 10 would keep state-based newsreaders but the news content would be national, but another source denied this saying there was no point to state-based newsreaders if you don’t have state-based news.

The cuts have occurred as the network has struggled with ratings and advertising.

'Revenue is down the toilet and the ratings are less than auspicious,' Peter Meakin, Network Ten news and current affairs director told the Australian Financial Review this morning.

'Whether I disagree with the cuts is purely academic. I'm not briefed to run the company and have very little financial experience.

'Clearly the board has had a look at it and this is the decision they’ve made and I guess we have to live it,' said Mr Meakin.

Wake Up was the brainchild of Sunrise mastermind Adam Boland, and was launched in November 2013, with three hosts, Natasha Exelby, James Mathison, and Natarsha Belling. Just 16-days later, Ms Exelby was cut from the panel, after it was decided the show's chemistry was not working.

It has struggled to attract viewers, averaging 30-40,000 per day, around a tenth of the viewers tuning in to Channels Nine and Seven.

In his email to staff, Mr McLennan stated: 'Wake Up has not resonated with enough viewers to make it a viable program.'

Channel Ten' Wake Up presenter Natarsha Belling appeared upset as she left the show's Manly studios this morning as other staff hugged and supported each other amid reports the show is about to be canned due to low ratings.

Mr McLennan told staff this morning: 'Let me assure you the changes are not being undertaken lightly.

'No one is happy about them, but unfortunately they are necessary.'

The last episode of the program will be aired this Friday.

Adam Boland, who had a breakdown three days after the show launched and left it in January 2014 to take care of his health, tweeted his support for his former colleagues.

'I feel very sad for all my friends at Ten. Very good people, let down by many things, including my early exit. Thinking of them all today,' he wrote.

'Some brilliant Ch10 staff are gonna be looking for work. An astute employer would snap em up quick smart,' wrote Dave Hughes, comedian and former co-host of Channel 10's The Project.

Studio 10 host Joe Hildebrand also took to Twitter to express his sadness at the decision, writing: 'Taking on titans like Sunrise and Today is the toughest job in TV and our mates at @WakeUp did it with heart and guts. Farewell friends.'

Sarah Harris and Jessica Rowe, Studio 10 co-hosts, also took to Twitter in support of their colleagues.

'Big hugs to my friends at Wake Up, Early/Morning News and Late News,' said Sarah.

Jessica wrote: 'Thinking of my friends and colleagues at Wake Up, morning and late news... Xxxx'

Studio 10 will continue to be produced.

It is rumoured that Wake Up might be replaced by a revamped version of Good Morning Australia, with Kerri-Anne Kennerley named as a possible host.
