A former treasurer and head of tax for Morrisons has been charged with insider dealing over Ocado share trades, according to the City regulator.

Paul Gerard Coyle, 50, has been charged by the Financial Conduct Authority with two counts of insider dealing related to shares in the online grocery delivery service between February and May 2013.

He was  reportedly arrested in Harrogate in December last year in a dawn raid by the FCA and Yorkshire police and suspended by Morrisons in January.

The FCA was able to prosecute under the Criminal Justice Act 1993.

A £200million partnership between the two companies was announced in May, which sent Ocado shares surging. 

The budget supermarket signed a 25-year deal with Ocado to acquire its distribution centre in Dordon, Warwickshire, and use its technology.

Morrisons has used Ocado's technological know-how to make its belated debut in internet deliveries, which finally began in January this year. 

Ocado's share price lifted by more than 500 per cent in 2013 following the £200million deal with Morrisons 

In 2013 Ocado's share price lifted by more than 500 per cent.

Those convicted of insider trading can face up to 20 years in prison and significant fines.

Morrisons shares are currently trading down by 2 per cent at 167.40p.

In a statement, Morrisons said the FCA's insider dealing investigation 'did not concern Wm Morrison Supermarkets plc nor any other Morrisons' employee'.

The supermarket said: 'Morrisons is satisfied with its governance and procedures concerning the handling of market sensitive data in this case and found that the company's procedures had been properly followed.

'These accusations, if proven, would be the result of an individual acting alone.'
