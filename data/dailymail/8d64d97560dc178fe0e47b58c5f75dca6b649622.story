Southampton will have to pay £5 million if they want to sign Feyenoord midfielder Tonny Vilhena, with the Dutch club reluctant to sell him for anything less. 

Feyenoord playing hard ball means that Saints boss Ronald Koeman and head of football development Les Reed face a tough decision as to whether to push the move through now or wait until the summer. 

Vilhena played regularly in Koeman's Feyeoord team last season when the Dutchman was in charge at De Kuip.

However, the 20-year-old has not enjoyed the same success under Koeman's replacement, Fred Rutten, and is keen to link up with his former boss at Southampton. 

But the south-coast club will have to meet Feyenoord's valuation with Vilhena having been a star of the Dutch Under-17 teams and is considered one of the country's brightest young talents.

Koeman and Reed will decide on Sunday whether Southampton should up their bid to £5m, following the £3m departure of Jack Cork to Southampton.
