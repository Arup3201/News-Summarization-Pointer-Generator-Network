Bernard Hopkins has launched a withering attack on Carl Froch by branding the English Super Middleweight boxer a 'coward' for avoiding a potential world title showdown.

Hopkins has hit back at Froch after the Nottingham fighter suggested a title bout against the 50-year-old American would be a 'lose-lose situation'.

Froch was hoping to face Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in Las Vegas but he had to scupper plans of a mega fight against the Mexican due to an elbow injury.

Bernard Hopkins has responded to Carl Froch's recent comments regarding a potential fight

The postponement led to talk of a potential fight against Hopkins until Froch ruled out the possibility.

Hopkins, speaking to Sky Sports, said: 'You should put all the pressure on that coward that calls himself one of the greatest European fighters of all time.

'That is not true, that’s an insult to Joe Calzaghe, and let me tell you something - that's an insult to any great fighter that has come out of the UK from the past and the present.

'To hear a guy make excuses for a legitimate force that he knows he will lose against and possibly lose his career, like many other fighters did when they stepped in the ring with "The Alien". '

Hopkins added he was happy for Froch to dictate where the potential fight would take place.

He said: 'If he wants to fight before he retires as he was quoted: "I want to fight in Vegas".

'Well, I haven’t fought in Vegas in multiple years. We can do it in Vegas, let's get our people together and talk. Or we can fight in the UK. He thought that was going to be something that was going to be a snag.

'Where a square ring is at, is my home. I've been all over fighting. I've never ducked where I fight.'
