A man-made party island set to rival Ibiza is being planned to attract revellers to the Arabian Gulf. 

Dream Island will be able to host around 20,000 partygoers with two 'mega clubs', four beach clubs, five hotels and 100 restaurants.

The island will be in Ras Al Khaimah, which is only a 40-minute drive from Dubai, once construction is completed.

But unlike Dubai where a personal licence is needed to drink alcohol, booze will flow freely on the island.

Sales and marketing director George Saad said: 'We're trying to make it the new Ibiza - a mini Ibiza dedicated solely to partying.

'People will be able to come here, stay in the hotel party at clubs on the beach, anything in the world you can do.

'And we are trying to attract festivals to come here - like Burning Man.'

Plans: The initial designs for Al Marjan including 'Dream Island' which developers hope will rival Ibiza and attract revellers to the Arabian Gulf

Expanding: The plans for the party island are on show alongside other building projects planned across the region at the Dubai Property show

The developers of the third of four islands that make up Al Marjan are looking to attract £3.2billion of investment.

The party town is on show and seeking British investors at the Dubai Property Show, in Kensington Olympia, this weekend.

The show was launched on Friday by UAE royalty Sheikh Mohmmed bin Maktoum Al Maktoum.

The 4 million square foot island will feature no homes and will only be open to visitors and residents of the neighbouring islands.

The island was built in 2013 and development to make it into a clubber's paradise is expect to be finished by 2018.

The four islands of Al Marjan stretch nearly three miles out into the sea and cover an area of 2.7 million square metres.
