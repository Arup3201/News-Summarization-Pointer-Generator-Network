Ivan Rakitic is the subject of a three-way tussle between Barcelona, Real Madrid and city rivals Atletco.

The Croatian star was instrumental in Sevilla’s Europa League triumph last season and La Liga’s giants want to snatch the 26-year-old playmaker.

Rakitic’s father confirmed the interest from Spain’s three biggest sides but also said Sevilla were trying to keep their star midfielder.

‘Right now his brother Dejan, who looks after his career, has offers from Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid,’ Luka Rakitic told Croatian daily Jutarnji.

‘But in any case, nothing will be decided until after the World Cup.

‘However the conditions offered so far are no better than those submitted by Sevilla, where Ivan is a god.’

Rakitic has one year left on his contract at the Andalusian club.

His release fee clause is €40million (£32.5m) but because of Rakitic’s contract situation the clubs are looking to purchase him for between £20-25m.

Of the three challengers for his signature, Atletico Madrid are closest to making a deal.

Barcelona’s new manager Luis Enrique is an admirer of Rakitic too and the Catalan club are striving to bring him to the Nou Camp.

While Real Madrid would also like to secure his signature it is unclear where he would feature in the side and it is possible that their interest is designed to be a disruptive influence to hamper their rivals.

The Champions League winners finished third in La Liga last season and will likely be active in the transfer market this summer to improve domestically.

Rakitic is aware of his status at Sevilla and his popularity among supporters. His wife is from Andalucia and it will take a considerable offer to uproot him.

Sevilla president Jose Castro will attempt to extract as much of the £32.5m clause as he can if Rakitic is sold.
