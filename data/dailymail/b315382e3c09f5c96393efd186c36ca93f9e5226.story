One man from Louisiana discovered a 2.89 carat white diamond at the Arkansas' Crater of Diamonds State Park in Murfreesboro about a week ago.

Brandan Kalenda of Louisiana found the giant rock on March 6 after searching for only 20 minutes in the Fugits Bank area of the park's search area.

Not only does Kalenda plan to keep his sparkly prize, he has also named it 'The Jax Diamond' after his baby son Jaxson.

Fox News spoke with park Interpreter Margi Jenks who said that the diamond is the 47th to be found and registered by park visitors this year.

It's also the fourth found since mid-February that weighs over a carat.

The Mail Online contacted the Crater of 
Diamonds State park and spoke with Waymon Cox who said that the park is 
not certified to assign monetary value to any of the stones. Also, the variety of stones make pricing one rather different.

'No two diamonds in the rough are alike,' said Jenks to Fox.

Jenks describes The Jax Diamond as being triangular with a metallic appearance. It's about the size of an English pea.

'We encourage park visitors to look for pockets or layers on the surface of gravel and search there,' said Jenks.

Kalenda decided to visit the park after the cast of TLC's '19 Kids and Counting' made a visit to the Crater of Diamonds Sate Park.

Jenks told Fox that now is the perfect time for diamond hunting because the recent rainfall and plowed fields make the diamonds easier to find.

'Diamonds are a bit heavy for their size, and they lack static electricity, so rainfall slides the dirt off diamonds that are on the surface of the search field leaving them exposed,' she said.

'When the sun comes out, theyâ€™ll shine and be noticeable.'

Cox told the Mail Online that the park is very crowded now during spring break, especially after newsof the recent discovery.

'A lot of people have come out,' he said.
