Sprinter Sacre will take a significant step towards a return to action when he takes part in a schooling session with jockey Barry Geraghty before racing at Newbury on Monday.

It will be the first time the 2013 Champion Chaser has been seen on a racecourse since being pulled up in the Desert Orchid Chase at Kempton on December 27 last year suffering from a fibrillating heart.

Trainer Nicky Henderson ruled out a comeback in that race earlier this month, saying it came too soon in Sprinter Sacre’s rehabilitation.

But amid increasingly positive reports that the eight-year-old is showing signs of his old sparkle, it is now hoped he could be ready to race again in the Clarence House Chase at Ascot on January 17.

Henderson said: ‘All being well he'll be at Newbury on Monday. I haven't worked out exactly what we're going to do yet. I'll have a word with Barry and then make a plan.

‘He won't be galloping round for two miles, but he'll have a spin out and jump a few fences and it just fits in nicely with the race at Ascot. The plan is to go to Ascot if everything goes well in the meantime. Timing-wise taking him to Newbury is perfect.’

Trainer Nicky Henderson is hopeful that Sprinter Sacre will make his return at Ascot in January

Henderson will attempt to simulate a race scenario by making Sprinter Sacre walk around the parade ring before setting foot on the track.

The seven-time grade one winner is 4-1 joint favourite with Coral for this season’s Champion Chase at Cheltenham in March.

Bracketed with him is reigning champion Sire De Grugy, himself on the comeback trail from injury but pencilled in for the Game Spirit Chase at Newbury in February.
