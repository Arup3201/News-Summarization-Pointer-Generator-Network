England face the ultimate test in rugby on Saturday afternoon as the All Blacks visit HQ looking for a fifth consecutive victory over the Red Rose.

New Zealand boast an astonishing 759 caps in their starting XV - while England have less than half that number with 358.

Richie McCaw is the All Blacks' most experienced player with 134 caps, but England's? Well, that is their often controversial hooker, Northampton's Dylan Hartley.

The 28-year-old has the most caps in Stuart Lancaster's side - 57 - and, as well as being one of the key figures in England's on-field 'leadership team', he is the de facto vice-captain.

For England to put so much responsibility on the shoulders of a man born in the heart of the country he faces on Saturday, in Rotorua on New Zealand's North Island, it is strange enough anyway.

He is, without a shadow of a doubt, a magnificent front-row forward. His lineout throwing is exemplary, he carries the ball well and he offers England much-needed go-forward ball. He also captained Northampton to the 2014 Premiership title. There is no doubt that he deserves to be in England's starting XV.

Yet when you add in Hartley's at-best shady career disciplinary record, it becomes an even more curious situation that he has such a prominent position in the team. Lesser players would surely have been cast aside by now.

In total, Hartley's on-field indiscretions have led to  a combined 48 weeks' worth of suspensions.

He has been suspended four times, including once in an England shirt.

While playing for the Red Rose in the 2012 Six Nations, Hartley bit Ireland flanker Stephen Ferris and was given an eight-week ban.

Perhaps his most infamous suspension, however, came while in a Northampton shirt. During the 2013 Aviva Premiership final at Twickenham - the venue of Saturday's contest with the All Blacks - Hartley was sent off for verbally abusing a match official.

He allegedly turned to referee Wayne Barnes before half-time of the match against Leicester and said: 'You f****** cheat.'

This indiscretion was punished with a further 13-week suspension and cost him a place on the victorious 2013 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia.

Add to that the 26-week ban he received for eye gouging Wasps forwards James Haskell and Jonny O'Connor in April 2007 and the two weeks he was given for punching Ulster hooker Rory Best during a Heineken Cup encounter and the total time period adds up to almost a year out for indiscretions.

Hartley must prove his worth to England by delivering when it matters most. They are less than 12 months away from a World Cup on home soil and they need to make a point to the All Blacks.

It is time for Hartley to stand up and be counted.
