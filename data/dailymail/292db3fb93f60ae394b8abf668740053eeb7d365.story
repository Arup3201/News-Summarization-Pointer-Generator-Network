A Romanian lorry driver who crushed a widow's arm with his 40-ton truck as she walked to put flowers on her husband's grave, has been fined just £73.

Rose Lethbridge, 77, was struck by Marcel Georgescue's  lorry as she crossed a side road in Southend, Essex.

The pensioner suffered catastrophic injuries after the lorry crushed her and had to have her arm amputated.

But Georgescue, 43, was handed just 
six points on his driving licence after he admitted careless driving, a 
charge which cannot lead to a jail sentence.

He was also ordered to hand Mrs Lethbridge a 'victim payment' of just £20, handed a fine of £73 and told to pay court costs of just £85.

Mrs Lethbridge remains in the Royal London Hospital after the accident nine days ago, where she is described as being in a stable condition.

Southend
 Magistrates' ' Court was told that Georgescu was turning right from a 
main road into a side road when the accident happened.

Prosecutor Simon Bravery told the court: 'Mr Georgescu failed to see her and knocked her to the ground as he was turning.

'She
 remained under the lorry for some while, but he didn't stop the lorry. 
He reversed and she was taken to the Royal London Hospital by air 
ambulance.

'She suffered serious injuries, but has been released from intensive care and her condition is described as stable.'

Georgescu's
 solicitor Jay Kallagher told the court his client had been married 19 
years with a 17-year-old son, had worked as a lorry driver since he was 
19 and had no previous convictions.

She
 said: 'He made full admission at the police station and the officer on 
the case noted he showed genuine remorse throughout the interview.

'He
 wants to make it known to the court today that he understands the 
tragic consequences of his driving on this day and told me he could not 
express in words how remorseful he is.'

However, her neighbours fear the widow - whose husband, Glyn, died three years ago - may never be able to come home again due to the nature of her injuries.

One lady said: 'She goes up to the cemetery regularly, that's where she was going and those flowers were from her garden.

'She was going to lay flowers on the grave. She goes up there every week. She's not only my neighbour, but we are friends to each other and we look after each other.' She called the sentence 'disgusting'.

The elderly woman, who asked not to be named, added: 'Rose won't be back home, she is very, very ill.

'She's been critically ill but there's a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel.

'Please God she will come home because her garden is her life. She does the communal garden all herself, it's immaculate.

'How she will cope with one hand. I dread to think.

'She is out there in her garden from morning until night, especially since her husband passed away.'

Mrs Lethbridge, who is now off life-support, is believed to be estranged from her children.

Barry Newman, manager of the Southend branch of Formula One Autocentres, witnessed the horror crash.

He said there was a lot of anger about the sentence handed down at Southend Magistrates' Court.

He said: 'If you had an industrial accident with those kind of injuries, you would get tens of thousands of pounds.

'It was horrific. We watched as the air ambulance came and the poor lady spent a long time under that lorry before she could be freed.'

His colleague, Michael Hart, was on a break and saw the impact.

He said: 'It was like it happened in slow motion in front of me. It was horrible and not something I'd ever like to see again.

'From the force of the impact, it didn't look good and she was under there for quite a while as medics treated her.'

Rachel Weller, a courier driver for Motex, also witnessed the crash and remained with Mrs Lethbridge while she was treated.

She said: 'To put it politely, the sentence is totally unfair given her injuries.'

Mrs Lethbridge also suffered a fractured collarbone, seven fractured ribs and had a collapsed left lung.
