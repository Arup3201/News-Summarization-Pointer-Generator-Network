Rangers have taken out a crisis loan to avoid being wound up by HM Revenue and Customs, it is understood.

It is believed the Scottish Championship club were handed a seven-day notice letter at the end of December relating to non-payment of National Insurance.

On Monday morning, the troubled Ibrox outfit announced shareholder and football board chairman Sandy Easdale has handed over a loan of £500,000 for 'general working capital purposes over the next few days'.

In 2012, Rangers were placed in administration then liquidated amid crippling debts, including unpaid tax. Newco Rangers subsequently took a place on the bottom rung of Scottish football and have since reached the second tier.

This latest loan – after previous cash injections from Newcastle United owner and Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley - has been secured against the £800,000 fee received from the transfer this month of 20-year-old Scotland international midfielder Lewis Macleod to Brentford.

Rangers also confirmed on Monday morning it has received an £18million takeover approach from American businessman Robert Sarver.

The owner of the Phoenix Suns basketball team, Sarver has until February 2 to make a firm offer for the Glasgow club.

But separate moves recently by the Three Bears consortium led by Douglas Park and by former Rangers director Dave King to make share purchases in the club mean the US tycoon is unlikely to succeed in his takeover – at least as originally planned. But the US financier may be prepared to back King and The Three Bears in their bid to seize control of the club.

Announcing the latest crisis loan to the Stock Exchange, a Rangers statement said: 'The facility is being provided by Alexander Easdale, a shareholder in the company and director of The Rangers Football Club Limited, the wholly owned subsidiary of RIFC.

'The facility will be used by the company for general working capital purposes over the next few days.

Alexander Easdale will make available to the company up to £500,000 on a fee and interest free basis and it will be secured against the income from the sale of player announced on 2 January 2015.

'The directors of Rangers, having taken advice from their nominated adviser, WH Ireland plc, believe that the terms of the facility are fair and reasonable as far as shareholders are concerned.'

Rangers have promised a further announcement in relation to Sarver's interest in the club.

'There can be no certainty that an offer will be made, nor as to the terms on which an offer may be made,' said a statement.

It also pointed out that should he make bid, he 'will be required to clarify his intentions (by February 2).'

A spokesman for Sandy and brother James Easdale, who has a seat on the plc board, declared the latest loan had been the only option for Rangers.

Jack Irvine, an Easdale family adviser, said: 'Once again Sandy has stepped up to the plate with this half million pound loan from his own pocket. Whilst we welcomed the recent share purchases by Dave King and Douglas Park and his consortium, this unfortunately did not put any funds into the club.

'Sandy was the only option for this cash injection at such short notice. The Easdale family remain totally committed to achieving a satisfactory financial future for Rangers and they hope all parties can work together in the future with that common goal.'
