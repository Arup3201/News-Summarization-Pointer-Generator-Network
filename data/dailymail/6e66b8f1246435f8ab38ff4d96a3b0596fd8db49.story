This is the moment a man is finally liberated of his crippling 132lbs scrotum, thanks to a kind-hearted doctor who agreed to carry out the surgery for free.

Wesley Warren Jr, 49, from Las Vegas, suffered from the rare medical condition scrotal lymphedema which saw his scrotum swell to gigantic proportions and left him feeling little more than a freak.

His ordeal began when he woke up one 
morning five years ago with a shooting pain in his groin, which grew 
steadily worse and his scrotum steadily bigger over the next nine 
months.

A team of four physicians begin the procedure to remove Las Vegas man Wesley Warren's 132lbs scrotum

Mr Warren was left barely able to walk and was often subjected to ridicule and abuse when he appeared in public.

His 
penis was buried so deeply in the abnormal growth that he was forced to 
urinate on himself and he was forced to turning hooded sweatshirts upside down and using them as pants.

At
 one stage he became so desperate he considered selling his testicles on eBay to
 pay for an operation to remove them.

Mr Warren's scrotum is taken away on a trolley for disposal. At one point he was so desperate he considered selling it on ebay to raise money for an operation

Fortunately, California doctor Dr Joel Gelman  took 
pity on Mr Warren and agreed to carry out the 13-hour operation to
 remove it for free.

The procedure, which was carried out on April 8, saw Dr Gelman and three other 
physicians cut away simultaneously on the grossly enlarged protective 
sack of skin and muscles that contained Warren's testicles and penis, 
according to the Las Vegas Review Journal.

The
 massive swelling was caused by fluid building up in his scrotum. Doctors
 had to remove the excess tissue and then completely rebuild his 
scrotum.

Struggle: Mr Warren uses a wheelchair to cart his vast appendage along a hospital corridor prior to the operation

Despite finally being  relieved of his burden, Mr Warren was initially unhappy claiming the surgery made his life a
 misery because it left him with a one-inch penis. He said he would 
never be able to have a relationship with a woman.

But finally, Warren is feeling optimistic about the future ahead of more surgery later this month and has now revealed how he would one day like to host his own talk show.

He told the Huffington Post: 'Talk radio is a longtime love," he says. "And the past few years has given me an awful lot of practice.

'If my life is proof of one thing, it's that anything's possible.'

'It was the worst pain I ever felt in my life,' he told the New York Post. 'It got so bad one day that I stood in 
my living room and cried. There was a fresh breakage of skin...and it stung to no end.

'I was expecting to be stared at — if you look like a freak you expect people to look at you like you’re a freak,' he said. 

Before: Wesley Warren spent the past five years of his life with a freakishly huge scrotum - the result of a rare medical condition called scrotal lymphedema

Home help: His ordeal began when he woke up one morning five years ago with a shooting pain in his groin, which grew steadily worse and his scrotum steadily bigger over the next nine months

'I would only get upset when, every 
once-in-a-while, some person with no manners would stare at me and start
 laughing and give me that "freak passing by" look.

'That caused me
 in the past to say a "word" or two with regards to rudeness. 'Besides, I was OK with the stares. That’s what I was 
expecting.'

Though he initially complained that he was 'still disfigured', he has since become more optimistic about his future.

'I can see a light at the end of the 
tunnel, but I’m still in the tunnel.'

The
 extremely rare condition is much more common in Africa and Southeast 
Asia, where it is caused by parasites, than it is in the western world.

Discomfort: Warren could not urinate like a normal man and wore a hoodie for pants to conceal his enormous genitals

Talking about his life before the 
operation he describes himself as a prisoner to his testicles and that 
the growth ruled his life.

'I could only walk in baby steps – I had to stop every 30 seconds,' he said.

'It
 was just horrible. I couldn’t get in and out of a vehicle and even then
 I fell down on to the pavement and it took four grown men to try and 
lift me up.

Fear: Warren was also afraid of dying on the operating table or losing his penis and his testicles if the complex procedure went wrong
