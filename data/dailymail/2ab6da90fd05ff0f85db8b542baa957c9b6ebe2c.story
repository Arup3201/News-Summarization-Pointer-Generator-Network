Stephen Gallacher believes golf’s persistent slow play ‘cheats’ should be banned from tournaments – even if it means missing a major.

The Scot pounced on Rory McIlroy’s recent plea for the game to be speeded up, recommending automatic one-shot penalties for anyone going over the clock. 'Everything's so instant now and everyone doesn't have as much time as they used to,' the world No 1 told the BBC. 'So you maybe try some way of speeding the game up.'

And Gallacher believes the game should follow the lead of cricket, pointing to England captain Alastair Cook’s recent one-game suspension for his team’s slow over rate as an example.

‘I think certain forms of slow play is cheating,’ said the Gallacher. ‘I think guys who are slow, who know they are slow and get fined all the time but don’t do anything about it are putting people off. They are certainly putting viewers off. The bit I think is cheating is they’ve got two paces, speeding up once they’ve been put on the clock.

‘We are on at the kids in our foundation all the time to speed up. Apparently all the committee guys say every week that’s what they talk about - but nothing happens.

‘I think on the pro tour you have to make it ruthless and say that’s it a shot penalty. You can’t have a monetary thing.

‘In cricket, if he doesn’t meet his over rate he’s out. You could do that. Two-shot penalties and you are suspended the next week - and it might be The Open.

Gallacher and McIlroy both say it is time to address the issue of pace of play in golf

The Scot has enjoyed his best year as a professional, which included winning the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles

‘Guys are never ready. The guy who plays third can slow everything up. By the time he gets to play, he’s not even got his glove on yet. As you get older you learn. I go out with my mates and go round in two and a half hours. We are always ready, with the glove out.

‘Guys on Tour playing third still have to get the glove on and get the yardage book out and you think: “Are you kidding?” Look at putting. Everybody looks at the putt from one side but the third guy hasn’t looked, and he ends up looking at it from four different sides.’

Gallacher, aware that often some of the worst offenders are young players fresh to the professional ranks, believes the key lies in education – and reviving the old ‘Apollo week’, named after an equipment manufacturer, that the European Tour used to run for rookies.

‘You need an Apollo week,’ he said, adding: ‘Get some ex-Tour pros in to show them what to do. Not many of us have bad times, the older generation.

‘You’ll p*** someone off. It has to be a uniformed approach. You go to the Challenge Tour and you only have three referees. How do you police that? The players have to do it themselves.

‘When I was first came on tour we had Apollo weeks. The new guys need something like that just to reiterate what happens on tour. They have to know what goes on. We had media training, we had TV training, you met the travel guys. It was like a big boot camp for a week and it was all laid out. That’s the way forward.’
