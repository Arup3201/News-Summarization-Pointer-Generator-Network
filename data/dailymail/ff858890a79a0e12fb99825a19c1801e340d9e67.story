A devastated mother has described the moment she smothered her son who was suffering from a terminal genetic disease.

Heather Pratten's son Nigel Goodman had Huntington's disease - a condition which had also killed his father Kenneth.

While his brother Philip also suffered with the condition, Nigel had never come to terms with his diagnosis, Heather said.

Heather Pratten's son Nigel Goodman had advanced Huntington's disease. She helped him take his own life by smothering him after he took a heroin overdose

Speaking on ITV's This Morning, she explained how on his 42nd birthday, Nigel had tried to take his life with a massive heroin overdose.

Lying next to him and seeing him struggling to breathe as the drug took hold, she took a pillow and suffocated him to relieve his suffering.

She told hosts Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield: 'I thought "this has to end". I couldn't take it any longer. I put a pillow over his face. When I took it away, he was gone.'

Although she was arrested and charged, an autopsy concluded her actions would not have changed Nigel's fate.

She was initially charged with murder, but eventually pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting suicide.A judge later ruled during her hearing in October 2000 that the case was an 'exceptional circumstance' and she was given a conditional discharge.

Nigel had never come to terms with his diagnosis, his mother said. On his 47th birthday he tried to take his own life

Heather has campaigned for a change in the
 law ever since Nigel's death in March 2000.

Her story features 
in an emotive new book: Assisted Dying: Who Makes The Final Decision?, published tomorrow.

Huntington's disease is an incurable disease caused by an inherited faulty gene. This gene produces a protein called Huntingtin.

It's not known how, but the gene causes widespread damage to the nerve cells in the brain, causing a range of symptoms.

Sufferers can exhibit emotional and mental changes such as mood swings, clumsiness, lack of motivation, aggression and depression which, in the early stages, can often be written off as simple personality traits.

Later, they develop physical problems such as the shakes or nervous tics, then weight loss and muscle weakness which leaves the patient unable to swallow, speak or move. Every sufferer has a different rate of deterioration, but it is a fatal condition.

Heather, who had five children, says she knew to be aware of the disease because her husband Kenneth had also suffered from it.

The couple had married in 1955 and had five ­children – Nigel, Philip, Stephen, Tina and Deborah – and raised them in Hornchurch, East London.

Then in his thirties, Kenneth became absent minded, would leave taps on and cigarettes lit in strange places, recalls Heather.

'It turned out his father had also had Huntington's, but his mother had never told him. We were told he had died of a nervous breakdown.'

Kenneth died at the age of 44 of a heart attack - and Heather began to worry if the devastating disease would present itself in any of her children.

A judge later ruled during Heather's hearing that the case was an exceptional circumstance and she was given a conditional discharge

'I told them not to have children in case they passed it on and to make the best of their lives.'

Her son Philip was diagnosed in his 30s and was accepting of the condition, she says.

'He was never very independently minded and we found him a place in one of the best care homes in the country for Huntington's - he really settled there.' Philip later died, aged 48, having been confined to a wheelchair.

But for his brother Nigel, things were very different - and Heather says she clearly remembers the day she realised he too had the disease.

Huntington's
 is an incurable disease caused by an inherited faulty gene, which produces a protein called Huntingtin.

It's not known how, but the gene 
causes widespread damage to the nerve cells in the brain, causing a 
range of symptoms.

Sufferers can exhibit emotional and mental 
changes such as mood swings, clumsiness, lack of motivation, aggression 
and depression which, in the early stages, can often be written off as 
simple personality traits.

Later, they develop physical problems 
such as the shakes or nervous tics, then weight loss and muscle weakness
 which leaves the patient unable to swallow, speak or move.

Every 
sufferer has a different rate of deterioration, but it is a fatal 
condition.

Huntingdon's is estimated to affect around 8,000 people in the 
UK.

In adults the symptoms usually appear between 35 and 50, although 
until a blood test was introduced around 20 years ago, it was very 
difficult to diagnose it at an early stage.

She told This Morning: 'Nigel loved to draw cards and I would always receive a hand-drawn birthday and Christmas card.

'Then one day he got me a shop-bought card - and I just knew. He couldn't draw any more. He had Huntington's.'

Unlike Philip, Nigel wanted to shut himself off from the world, preferring to stay in his flat.

'He then said he wouldn't live with the disease, he was going away to Scotland and not to contact him.

'I was very worried as I knew he was having difficulty getting on trains.

'I kept phoning and phoning him and finally he picked up and just said, "help me, I'm scared".

'I went to see him and he'd been trying to starve himself and had bought vodka to try and keep himself unconscious.

'He wanted me to buy him more vodka. Instead, I called an ambulance - he was furious.'

Then on Nigel's 42nd birthday, Heather went to his flat to take him out.

'We went out, but then he said he wanted to go back to the flat. I saw no reason not to.'

Back home, Nigel turned to his mother and said: 'My friends have got me what I needed.'

He left the room and came back holding a small pack of heroin and a syringe.

'It was the day he had chosen to die,' says Heather.

'He said he'd already tried to take his life twice in front of a train, but could only think of the driver.

'He'd also thought of hanging himself.

'I saw the heroin and thought "that is the best way for him to go". 

The pair then lay down, Nigel took the drug and they lay there chatting, she recalls.

Despair: Heather told hosts Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield she couldn't take Nigel's suffering any more. 'I put a pillow over his face. When I took it away, he was gone'

'Then we fell asleep and when I woke up, I could tell he was nearly gone. His face was white, his lips were blue and he was barely breathing.

'I thought "this has to end". I couldn't take it any longer. I put a pillow over his face. When I took it away, he was gone.'

Heather spent half an hour with Nigel before calling the police and explaining everything that had happened.

'It's not something I could keep inside,' she told Holly and Philip.

'I knew I could get 14 years but at that point, I was just worried about my family.'

Strong: Heather has campaigned for a change in the law ever since Nigel's death. Her story features in an emotive new book

She was conditionally discharged for a year. Judge Graham Boal told her: 'Your story is one that would move the hardest of hearts.'

Since then, Heather has campaigned for dignity in dying and a chance to the law.

She told This Morning: 'There must be safeguards in place for terminally ill, mentally competent people.

'We are really lacking in compassion for people who are suffering.'
