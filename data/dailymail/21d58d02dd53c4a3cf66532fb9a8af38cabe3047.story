As the world's most famous supermodel, Kate Moss has worked with countless acclaimed photographers, designers and celebrities and now, the notoriously tight-lipped model has revealed exactly what goes on behind the closed doors of fashion.

Speaking in a rare interview with photographer Nick Knight, SHOWstudio founder and long-time friend, Kate opens up about her figure, body image and enduring appeal as a model.

When Knight asks her about her time as the
 unwitting poster girl for 'heroin chic' - a mid-1990s look characterised by extreme slimness, pallor, dark eyes and angular bone structure - she reveals: 'I think I was just really young and 
thin, I mean my daughter's tiny…

'I was working in fashion, back in the 
day they didn't feed you. The jobs I was doing they didn't have 
catering.'

Opening up: Kate Moss, who is usually extremely elusive and swears by the mantra 'never complain, never explain', has opened up about the industry that sky-rocketed her to fame in a candid interview

We adore Saint Laurent!

This super model is not scared of anything! No matter what red carpet she is on, Kate is willing to try something risky, and this time it's her striped sheer shirt by Saint Laurent.

Kate has shown off her more masculine, androgynous style of late, opting for tuxedo jackets and trousers, usually teamed with a fitted shirt underneath, and this one, from Saint Laurent's Resort 2014 collection, is the most luxe one we've seen her in.

Even though this is head-to-toe black, the stripes on Kate's sheer shirt draw your eye in. She's a clever lady too, just about covering up enough body to be acceptable on a red carpet.

Since taking over the French fashion house last year, Hedi Slimane has steered it's direction into uber cool, rock chick territory, which is where Kate comes in.

This is iconic Kate at her tailored best.

Kate, now 40, also opens up about the topless photograph by Corinne Day that featured on the cover of The Face in 1990 and catapulted her to fame at the age of 15.

'It was funny, but at the same time I was really embarrassed about my body,' she said. 'Very, very self-conscious. I was 14 or 15, still at school.'

Despite fronting some of the most high-profile campaigns of the last 25 years, Kate is still mystified by her appeal.

The mother, who has appeared on the cover of fashion bible Vogue 35 times, admits she has no idea why her appearance on the glossy cover causes magazine sales to sky-rocket.

'I know it's weird though, innit? 'Cause I don't understand, I mean…let's not question it!,' she said.

Having just hit the big 4-0, Mossy is busier than ever.

Last week she unveiled her hotly anticipated collection for Topshop and has been quietly creating a new beauty range for Rimmel London, too.

The
blonde was also recently unveiled as the face of Alexander 
McQueen's SS14 campaign, and also is a contributing editor for Vogue.

At
 the end of last year, she was announced as the face of St. Tropez and 
even designed a range of smartphone accessories for Carphone Warehouse.

And her hard work is certainly paying off. After twenty stellar years in the industry, Kate saw her earnings triple in 2012.

Her
 total earnings as of October 2012 for the preceding year totalled 
£11.72 million - that's nearly three times the amount she earned in 
2011.

Bigger than ever: At the age of 40, Kate is 
still going strong and one of her most popular campaigns was with St. 
Tropez last year

Maria Malone, Senior Lecturer and fashion expert at Manchester Metropolitan University, said: 'When
 Kate Moss first appeared in magazines, she was a quirky antidote to the
 long-legged, perfect in every way type models that consumers 
were previously bombarded with.

'Kate is unique and distinct in appearance, preventing look-a-likes and making her stand out. 

'She
 has a natural "imperfect" yet unmistakable beauty which makes women 
relate to her and men believe her to be a more approachable "girl next 
door" than the unobtainable supermodels of old.

'The shelf-life of a model is short but Kate Moss is more than a model: she is a brand, a British brand.'
