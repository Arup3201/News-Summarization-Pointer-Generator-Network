The number of chickens contaminated with a potentially lethal food poisoning bug could be far higher than originally feared, sources have claimed.

A study published earlier this year by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) found that six in ten roasting birds were carrying the bug campylobacter.

But industry sources believe that research due to be released today will show that levels were even worse in chickens purchased over the summer. One told the industry website FoodManufacture.co.uk that as many as nine in ten chickens in some samples tested positive for the bug.

Campylobacter is associated with 280,000 food poisoning cases a year and as many as 100 deaths, making it Britain's biggest food poisoning threawt

Ministers, supermarkets and producers have known about the problem of campylobacter for more than a decade, but promises to reduce its levels in chicken have so far failed to deliver any improvement.

The bug is associated with 280,000 food poisoning cases a year and as many as 100 deaths, making it Britain’s biggest food poisoning threat.

The survey results published today will for the first time list contamination levels in chicken sold by Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, the Co-op, Waitrose and Marks & Spencer.

Andrew Large, the chief executive of the British Poultry Council, said there are good reasons to believe that the latest study will reveal a rise in the number of contaminated birds. This is because the results will include chickens which were reared in large barns over the summer months when any infections or bugs in the flocks are likely to spread more rapidly.

He said: ‘It would be fair to say that campylobacter has a seasonal effect. There is a historical trend of it peaking in the summer. There is no reason to believe this latest survey won’t reflect that trend.’

But Mr Large defended the industry’s failure to deliver a reduction in rates, saying producers have struggled to identify how the bug is being introduced to flocks. While it is found in the wider environment and countryside, most of the 800million chickens raised for food in the UK each year spend their entire lives inside.

Supermarkets and their trade body the British Retail Consortium (BRC) have been involved in a fierce lobbying campaign designed to prevent stores selling so-called ‘dirty chicken’ being named.

It is believed that they asked the ministers in food and farming department DEFRA and the Prime Minister to keep today’s survey results secret. Initially, these attempts appeared to be successful – however the FSA decided to go public after the Daily Mail lifted the lid on the attempted cover-up this summer.

Research published today by consumer group Which? has revealed that 55 per cent of shoppers think they have been kept in the dark about the problem.

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘Our research clearly shows that the majority of people are concerned about high levels of this potentially deadly bug in their supermarket chicken.

‘By releasing information about which supermarkets are most affected, the FSA will at once put more public pressure on the poor performers to improve and give consumers better information about campylobacter levels.’

The BRC pointed out that some stores are helping by introducing ‘roast in the bag’ packs so people do not have to touch the raw chicken at all. However a spokesman for the trade body attempted to shift responsibility for tackling campylobacter to shoppers, saying they should protect themselves by handling chicken carefully and cooking it thoroughly.

They added: ‘At the moment the only way to be sure it is safe to eat is by cooking it properly and observing good kitchen hygiene.’
