Following back-to-back sunshine breaks in Puerto Rico and Miami Topshop heiress Chloe Green was back to work on Thursday launching her latest shoe collection in London.

The 22-year-old has hit the headlines this year thanks to a high profile romance with J-Lo's ex Marc Anthony, but he was nowhere to be seen as the tycoon's daughter and her mother Tina threw an exclusive event in Notting Hill to unveil her new designs to the fashion press.

The first two collections, designed by Chloe and her team and stocked in Selfridges as well as Topshop (of course) as well as on Chloe's website, defied critics to become a commercial success and the businesswoman is hoping the latest shoe and accessory line will follow suit.

Chloe said: 'I have learned a lot 
since my first collection. Instead of just creating shoes that I would like I'm learning about designing for my market, which includes a lot of tall people that I hadn't expected, clubbers, 
people on holiday and girls out for dinner, As well as my mum.

'I get brilliant feedback from 
customers who like what I'm doing and now my biggest challenge is to 
keep bringing them back each season by reworking their favourites as 
well as giving them something new.

'Even
in the Christian Louboutin or Giuseppe Zanotti world of shoes the classic styles
are available season after season, they are just revamped with new 
detail.'

The first two collections defied critics to become a commercial success and the label is now stocked at Selfridges as well as Topshop and on Chloe's own site

The new collection includes stacked platforms and mega wedges, all featuring Chloe's signature green sole

As a petite girl growing up in the world of fashion very high heels were an early necessity for Philip Green's only daughter.

She said: ''What do you do when you are a short 14-year-old and your friends all start growing taller and leaving you behind? You find the highest pair of heels your mother owns and start trying to walk in them.

'I spent a lot of my early teenage years practising walking in my mum's shoes, and now she is one of my biggest fans... she wears my shoes more than I do.'

Talking about the collection which this season includes skyscraper wedges,
stacked platforms and studded sandals as well as hi-top trainers all 
with a distinctive jade green sole, Chloe said: 'They are fast fashion 
shoes but they are also a bit exclusive - it's nice that you won't see 
many people in the same style as you on a night out.

'We have bought the styles on, but 
you have to always be proud of what you design and be able to stand by 
it and I am proud of the shoes in all three of my collections because 
they are all very me.'

Chloe said: ''My biggest challenge is to keep bringing my customers back each season by reworking their favourites as well as giving them something new.'

Chloe's relationship with boyfriend Marc Anthony has raised eyebrows due to the 22 year age gap, but the tycoon's daughter admitted that she doesn't let him being twice her age stop her telling him what to wear.

She told Grazia Daily: 'I get the odd question of 'Do you like what I'm wearing?' and I'm like, 'No not really'. Then he says, 'How would you wear it?'. I'll then say, 'Make it a bit cooler - wear it with some trainers and a T-shirt.' He's then, 'Okay, I'm not sure, but if you like it, I like it.'

Beau Marc is obviously a fan of her work, but he's not her only celebrity supporter.

She said: 'Nicole Scherzinger has been great. She saw my collection and loved it and wanted to wear my shoes. Nicole Richie has been really supportive.

'If people don't like it they are going to say something about it so it's just so amazing to have had such great feedback. Like Demi Lovato told me she likes my shoes and I was like, 'You don't just have to say that.' But she said she loved them because they are so comfortable.'

A lot 
of moisturiser will make them easier to get on. Baby powder and a 
platform will make them more comfortable, but my absolute tip is not to 
take them off.

Shoes can be as high as you like as long as they are 
comfortable (and believe it or not we work hard to make even the 
highest of the CSG heels comfortable).

The collection includes rocky accessories and pretty printed scarves
