A Ukrainian anti-government activist who fled the country after being abducted said he was tortured and forced to admit he was an American spy.

Dmytro Bulatov, 35, a member of Automaiden - a group of car owners that has taken part in protests against President Viktor Yanukovyvh - went missing on January 22.

He said he was kidnapped, crucified and had part of his ear cut off as his captors forced him to say on camera that he had accepted money from the US Embassy, to organise anti-government protests in the country.

He was discovered outside Kiev yesterday and told rescuers that his kidnappers kept him in the dark for more than a week, beat him severely, nailed him to a cross and sliced off a piece of ear, before eventually dumping him in a forest.

'I was telling them lies just to stop the torture... At one point I asked them to kill me because I couldn't stand it any more,' said the 35-year-old, speaking at the Vilnius University Emergency Hospital in Lithuania where he is being treated after leaving Ukraine on Sunday.

He said unidentified assailants had driven nails through his hands in a 'crucifixion' and had beaten him during a week in captivity.

'They crucified me, they nailed down my hands. They cut off my ear, they cut my face. There isn't a spot on my body that hasn't been beaten...Thank God I am alive,' Bulatov told Ukraine's Channel 5.

Footage shows his face and clothes covered in blood and his swollen hands showing nail marks.

EU leaders offered to help the activist after Ukrainian police said they wanted to charge him with taking part in 'mass disorder' related to protests consisting of convoys of sometimes hundreds of cars driving up to the homes of allies of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.

Bulatov described his kidnap as 'the worst experience I've ever had'. He still suffered severe headaches and dizziness.

Video of his bloodied face has been replayed repeatedly on opposition television channels in Ukraine, fuelling anger among protesters occupying main streets and public buildings across the country.

Bulatov said he would not return to Ukraine unless he got guarantees that he will not be prosecuted.

'I want my government to give guarantees to the international community that I will not be politically prosecuted,' he said.

'The government should close all criminal cases against activists, including me, who have taken part in the protests.'

Yanukovich sparked the protests in 
November when he spurned a trade pact with the 28-nation EU and turned 
instead to Ukraine's old master Moscow for financial support. 

Opposition leader Petro Poroshenko rushed to the hospital where Bulatov was taken last night.

'Dmytro
 asked to pass his greetings to everyone and to say that he has not been
 broken and will not be broken,' Poroshenko told Channel 5.

'That he is full of energy and despite the fact that he body was been beaten, Dmitry's spirit is strong.'

Police said they have opened an investigation and said the car he was driving when he disappeared had been found.

Bulatov is among three activists whose disappearances have shocked the country, especially after one of them was found dead.

He went missing one day after Igor Lutsenko, another prominent opposition activist, who was discovered after being taken to the woods and beaten severely by unknown attackers. 

Lutsenko was kidnapped from a hospital, where he had brought a fellow protester, Yuri Verbitsky, to be treated for an eye injury. Verbitsky was also beaten severely and was later discovered dead. 

The disappearances prompted an outcry from protesters, who accused the government of intimidating the opposition. 

The protests started after Yanukovych 
backed out of an agreement to deepen ties with the European Union in 
November, but quickly came to encompass an array of discontent over 
corruption, heavy-handed police and dubious courts.

Negotiations between the authorities and the opposition on finding a way out of the crisis appeared to have stalled yesterday, after Yanukovych took an unexpected sick leave and told opposition leaders that it was now up to them to make concessions. 

This week Yanukovych accepted the resignation of his Prime Minister Mykola Azarov and the parliament, which he controls, rescinded harsh anti-protest legislation that sparked last week's violence.

But a bill passed by Yanukovych's allies in parliament offered to grant amnesty to protesters only after they vacate scores of government-buildings they have seized across the country, a demand rejected by the opposition.
