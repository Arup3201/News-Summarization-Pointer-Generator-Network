Barcelona right back Dani Alves has taken to Instagram to reveal his peaceful side by posting a picture of himself reading a book on Brazilian volleyball.

The image, which portrays Alves as an extremely tranquil character, comes just days after the Brazilian international publicly ranted about the apparent unfair criticism former manager Tata Martino received during his time at the club.

Martino, who left Barcelona in the summer after just one season at the Nou Camp, was blamed for the Catalan giants' poor form during the 2013/14 campaign.

However Alves has leaped to the defence of the recently-appointed Argentina boss and also blasted the Spanish press for suggesting Luis Enrique was keen on selling the experienced defender.

‘I have two years left and I deserve respect for what I’ve achieved here,’ blasted Alves.

‘If we’re playing in a collective sport, the blame is ours, for good and bad.

'So people can forget writing stories like it was Tata’s fault because he had a different idea. No, for f***’s sake!

'Tata had the same idea as all our other trainers, but of course, we didn’t do our job well, and it’s Tata’s fault!'
