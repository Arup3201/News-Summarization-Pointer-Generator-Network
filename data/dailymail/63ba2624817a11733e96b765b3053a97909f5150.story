American skier Lindsey Vonn was back on the slopes after a long injury lay-off as she turns her attention to regaining her Olympic title.

Vonn, 29, missed out on the Sochi Olympics after rupturing her knee ligaments, after returning too quickly from a previous operation.

But the former World and Olympic champion believes she can still compete in Pyeongchang in four years, by which point she will be 33.
