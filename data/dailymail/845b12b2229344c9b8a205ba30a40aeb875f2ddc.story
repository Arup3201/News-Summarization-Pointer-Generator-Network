THE last time we endured a blistering hot summer it buckled railway lines, melted roads and had millions of us wilting.

It might be worth warming up to the idea – because extreme heat will become the norm in the UK within 30 years, say forecasters.

A Met Office report says heatwaves like that of 2003 – when temperatures soared to a record 101F (38.5C) – will happen every other year by the 2040s.

Heatwave: The beatch in Margate, Kent, on August 6, 2003. Scientists expect powerful heatwaves such as the one that hit in 2003 to be commonplace by the 2040s.

Although it will pile pressure on the 
health service, water supplies and farming, experts said it may also 
mean a boom in products such as English wine as conditions improve for 
heat-loving plants.

Winters are also expected to become generally milder – with the occasional very cold one, as occurred in 2010.

Professor
 Stephen Belcher, head of the Met Office’s Hadley Centre, said: ‘At the 
moment, we’re able to say that by the 2040s we can expect events like 
2003 to be normal.’

In fact by the end of the century, 2003 could even 
be viewed as a cold summer if trends continue, he said.

But
 along with hotter summer months we could be heading for more frequent 
heavy winter downpours.

‘Heavy rain is becoming heavier and that’s 
consistent with our picture of a warming world and warming atmosphere,’ 
said Professor Belcher.

Freezing: People will still have to plan for the occasional very cold winter, as occurred in 2011. The Angel of the North naer Gateshead is seen in December of that year

The report points to a combination of natural 
processes and human influences on Britain’s changing climate.

It blamed a
 series of recent wet summers on natural climate variation, but said man
 could be partly responsible for the blisteringly hot 2003.

The report concluded: ‘The UK has seasonal weather that varies hugely from year to year due to natural processes.

‘Nevertheless,
 human influence has been detected in the hot temperatures experienced 
in Europe during the summer of 2003, and there are signs that the 
character of rainfall has shifted in the last 50 years with slightly 
more heavy rainfall events, consistent with a warmer atmosphere holding 
more water.

Flooding: Heavy downpours are becoming more frequent in the UK - a pattern likely to be linked to climate change. Moorland in Somerset is seen last month

'Other seasons, such as the cold winter of 2010/11 and the 
wet summer of 2012 appear to be associated with natural fluctuations in 
the UK’s varied climate.’

Professor
 Andrew Challinor, from the University of Leeds, said warmer 
temperatures could cause wheat yields to drop by up to ten per cent.

But
 there would also be more ‘opportunities’ for British farmers – who 
would be able to grow new crops such as grapes and maize, he added.

More
 than 2,000 people are thought to have died of heat-related causes in 
the UK in 2003, and 20,000 in the rest of Europe.

Alongside traffic 
chaos, hosepipe bans were imposed and rising demand for air conditioning
 caused electricity ‘brownouts’.
