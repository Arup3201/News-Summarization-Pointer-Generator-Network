Police officers discovered a 15in knife yesterday while on the lookout for a gang of youths smoking cannabis.

Authorities were called to Perronet House in Elephant and Castle yesterday evening by a resident who said youths were smoking drugs in his stairwell.

When they arrived at around 8pm the gang ran away, but left behind the blade which was seized by Sergeant David Hunt and his team.

Police found this 15in knife while looking for youths smoking cannabis. The gang fled but dropped the blade

Tweeting the picture, he said: 'Just seized this knife maybe saved another life? Unfortunately didn't catch the youth carrying it. The worrying thing is why did they have it in the first place?'

Mr Hunt received a flurry of messages from stunned Twitter users who saw his picture.

A fellow Met police sergeant, Chris Molnar, wrote: 'Great work. I think you've just topped Crocodile Dundee there #ThatsNotAKnife.'

Immediately after the knife was found, Sgt Hunt tweeted the pictures and received messages of support from the public and other officers

Tube driver Andy Ross commented: 'Excellent job by the team getting that off the streets. My blood ran cold just looking at it!'

Ellen Griffin posted 'Good on you! Horrible to think what may have been done with it,' while Christina Gill added: 'That could take out quite a few lives. Let's get rid of stuff like this in the neighbourhood.'
