Petrolheads can admire their car while eating their dinner in a new apartment block with an 'en-suite' garage in the sky.

This Singapore skyscraper not only houses wealthy people in comfort, it makes sure they can be within touching distance of their prized supercars by installing a see-through lift.

Costing from S$15,000, or more than £7,500, a month to rent, it is one of the most exclusive addresses in Singapore.

Residents, worn out from a day of driving their Ferraris or Lamborghinis around the streets of southeast Asia can just drive their car into the garage where it will be lifted to their floor.

After making sure the car lines up within the bay, drivers can get out and hit a few buttons on the keypad to start the lift in motion.

While the driver gets in the ordinary lift, the car is moved into one of its own which is glazed on three sides.

The fully-automated system aims to get your car to your floor in the same time it takes to get in your front door and there is even a colour-changing light on the bottom of the car platform.
