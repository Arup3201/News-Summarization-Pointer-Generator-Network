It’s a decision that every seasoned traveller has wrestled with when a hotel doorman calls a taxi or a guide wraps up a tour – who should you tip during your travels and how generous should you be?

While tipping is customary in most Western nations, many tourists are making big mistakes when it’s time to show their appreciation for good or exceptional service, largely because they don’t know how much to give and they are unaware of local customs.

It can lead to awkward or uncomfortable situations, especially when the amount doesn’t reflect the quality of the service provided or no tip is given at all to someone who is expecting one or may be relying on gratuity to pay their bills.

Tipping is not expected in China, but it has been catching on at businesses frequented by Western tourists

In a small number of countries, holidaymakers must tread carefully to avoid offending employees in the service industry. In Japan, for example, tipping is considered an insult.

As for how much, it depends on the type of service provided, quality and geographic location as the rules vary by country. If the service is extremely poor, it’s OK to leave nothing at all.

Etiquette expert William Hanson, author of The Bluffer’s Guide to Etiquette, said: ‘If the service or standards are sloppy then do not tip as the staff will only think that they are being rewarded and will get complacent and standards will not improve.’

Paul Fidgeon, associate professor of tourism at the University of West London’s School of Hospitality and Tourism, said tipping can be an ethical minefield, but the 10 per cent rule is a good one to follow.

He said: ‘There are clearly issues here around who should you tip, how much should you tip, and should you tip at all, and there are big differences between countries and cultures.

The standard tip for hotel bell staff is £1 to £5 per bag (or $1 to $5) when it is delivered to the room

‘My advice here would be, in order to prevent problems, is do your research before you travel and try and find out about tipping culture and customs in that country prior to leaving home.

‘If in doubt, a small gratuity is taken a sign of appreciation.’

Oonagh Shiel, travel expert at Cheapflights.co.uk, added: ‘For those who are prepared to put a dent in their travel spend to cough up the cash needed for service charges, the rules surrounding tipping around the world are far from finite.

‘Whether you’re paying in euros, Indian rupees or US dollars the tipping system can come with a myriad of country-specific guidelines, leaving many tourists suitably perplexed.’

Despite the naysayers, it can lead to better service.

Mr Hanson said he once over-tipped by about 100 per cent following an evening drink in the bar at a Washington, DC, hotel.

He added: ‘Needless to say at breakfast the next day and for every breakfast there after I got incredible service and staff were falling over themselves to accommodate my every need.

‘I had fresh pastries “on the house” brought over, even though I didn’t want them, and everyone seemed to know my name suddenly.’

MailOnline Travel spoke to travel insiders to learn more about who should receive a tip – and how much – in countries where it is accepted.

If a service charge isn't included, the standard tip at a restaurant is 10 to 15 per cent 

Restaurant wait staff

These days, restaurants tend to include a service charge on the bill, and it is usually noted near the bottom.

In the UK, the standard service charge is 12.5 per cent of the bill.

If a service charge isn't included, the standard tip ranges from 10 to 15 per cent worldwide or up to 20 per cent for exceptional service in countries where it is common.

Mr Hanson said: ‘The standard used to be 10 per cent - a nice easy percentage for people to work out but in the last ten years restaurants have sneakily pushed this up to 12.5 per cent, which is a pain for everyone concerned, but 10 per cent is still a good guide.’

The same rule of thumb typically applies for room service or a bartender.

Marriott places envelopes in guest rooms at 1,000 of its hotels to encourage tipping for housekeeping staff

The American Hotel & Lodging Association published a gratuity guide which offers the following advice for guests:

Housekeeping staff: Leave a tip of $1 to $5 in a marked envelope or with a note.

Concierge: Tip $5 to $10 depending on the service provided.

Hotel shuttle driver: Give $1 to $2 or $4 to $5 per party.

Valet/parking attendant: Hand over a tip of $1 to $5 when the car is delivered.

Bell staff/porters: $1-$5 per bag, especially if the luggage is heavy or the staff member explains the room and its features.

Door staff: Tip $1-$2 if they hail a cab.

Delivery of special items (an extra blanket, for example): $2 for one item, $1 for more

Room service: If there is no service charge, tip 15 to 20 per cent.

Restaurant: Leave a tip amounting to 15 per cent of the total bill or 20 per cent for exceptional service.

Bartender: 15 to 20 per cent of the tab.

Housekeeping staff

These hotel employees tend to be the forgotten ones because they tend to do their work when guests are not around.

But some hotels are starting to remind their customers of the work that they do.

Marriott places envelopes in guest rooms at nearly 1,000 of its hotels to encourage tipping for its cleaners.

The American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA) published a gratuity guide, which said guests should leave a tip of $1 to $5 in a marked envelope or with a note.

Housekeeping staff in better hotels should expect £5 to £10 at the end of a week’s stay, said Mr Hanson.

Concierge

Tips for concierges depend on the nature of the service provided.

Did they book a table at a trendy restaurant? A few pounds or dollars should do.

If they managed to score hard-to-get tickets to a concert or sporting event, a tip of at least $10 (approximately $6.50) is warranted, the AHLA said.

Another option is leaving a lump sum upon departure.

It is not uncommon to tip hotel door staff £1 to £2 for hailing a cab, and £1 to £5 per bag for bell staff

Porters and door staff

The standard tip for hotel bell staff is £1 to £5 per bag ($1 to $5 or the equivalent in local currency) when it is delivered to the room.

It should be on the higher end of the scale if the bags are heavy or if the employee takes time to show you how to operate the TV or explain the room’s features.

Guests who request bell service when they check out should provide another tip.

It is not uncommon to tip door staff £1 to £2 for hailing a cab.

Taxi drivers are usually tipped 10 per cent of the fare, although in some countries it is common to round up

Transportation

For valet service, tip £1 to £5 (or $1 to $5) to the employee when the car is delivered.

Those who are driven to and from their hotel by shuttle should give £1 to £2 or £4 to £5 per party.

Taxi drivers are usually tipped 10 per cent of the fare, although in some countries it is common to simply round up to the nearest whole number.

In Africa, holidaymakers should budget a tip of at least $10 per day (in a shared vehicle) for game rangers

Tour guides

This is another situation where the 10 per cent rule tends to apply.

Experts said the standard tip for a tour guide is 10 to 20 per cent for a job well done on a day tour.

For multi-day group tours, about £5 a day in local currency should be enough.  

Before travelling abroad holidaymakers should take some time to research local tipping customs to avoid an embarrassing situation.

Saskia Welman of Holidaylettings.co.uk said: ‘If you haven’t managed to research acceptable tipping advice for your destination, keep an eye out on what other tourists around you are tipping.

‘Never ask whether you should tip someone or not as this can be embarrassing for the service person or you could end up being ripped off.’

Here are a few customs to take note of:

Tipping is considered an insult in Japan

Africa: Ten to 15 per cent is the norm at restaurants, but the bill may include a service charge. For game rangers, holidaymakers should budget a tip of $10 per day (approximately £6.50) in a shared vehicle, or at least double that amount if they are travelling in a private vehicle, said Oonagh Shiel, travel expert at Cheapflights.co.uk.

Australia: There is no tipping culture in Australia or New Zealand, so it is not a requirement. For those who receive exemplary service, a small tip is a good way to show appreciation, said Ms Shiel.

Caribbean: Many all-inclusive resorts discourage tipping as it is typically included in the cost of the room. Guests who are unsure should check with the concierge to find out if tips are permitted.

China: Tipping is not required or expected, but it is common at hotels and restaurants frequented by Western tourists. High-end hotels or restaurants may add a service charge to the bill. Tipping is very common in Hong Kong and Macau.

Egypt: Expect to pay a further five to ten per cent on top of the five to ten per cent service charge.

France: ‘Service compris’ means that a service charge is included on the bill, but customers can leave extra if they were satisfied with the service.

Germany: Don't leave a tip on the table at a restaurant. Hand it to the waiter or waitress. 

Japan: Tipping is considered an insult in Japan, so don’t bother offering a little extra to your cab driver or waiter.

Spain: A tip of between seven and 13 per cent is commonplace in restaurants, according to the level of service received, though travellers are unlikely to get a rap on the wrist if no tip is given, said Ms Shiel.

Thailand: Tipping is not a requirement, but 20 baht is acceptable in many situations.
