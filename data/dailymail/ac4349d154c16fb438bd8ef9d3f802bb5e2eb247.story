A police officer was awarded £16,610 in 
compensation after he fell over a pile of blankets while chasing a suspect, it has emerged.

Shocking figures released under the Freedom of Information Act reveal how police forces across the country have paid out hundred of thousands of pounds to resolve compensation claims.

Nottinghamshire Police has paid out almost £450,000 over the last five years while Humberside Police has paid £63,189 to 
officers and staff who have been hurt as well as an additional £136,747 
in other costs, including legal fees, in the past three years.

Nottinghamshire Police faced 43 successful claims for bizarre work injuries by officers and civilian staff between 2007 and 2012.

One member of staff was handed £18,400 for
injuring their back after falling off a chair, while one employee received 
£8,130 after falling over photocopying paper.

Another worker was awarded £10,615 after 
they were burnt by boiling water and another got £4,450 for slipping on 
an empty bottle in a car park.

There have also been six payouts for officers who have by bitten by the force's own dogs.

One policeman received £17,826 for being
bitten by a police dog, while another got £8,050 and two other 
officers pocketed almost £3,500.

But the biggest payout was a staggering £43,000 for an employee who slipped on ice in a loading bay and injured their back.

In Humberside, the highest amount went to a police 
officer who suffered a wrist sprain after tripping on a bag, which had 
been left in a corridor. They received £11,450.

Another police officer is suing the 
force after spraining their left foot when their heel became caught in a
gate as they left a car park. The claim has not been settled.

Other compensation claims to be settled, which have been criticised by the Taxpayers' Alliance, include:

Mark Spencer, Conservative MP for 
Sherwood, Nottinghamshire, said the figures were evidence that a 'compensation 
culture' has spread to the force.

He said: 'We have lost the plot in terms of what we think it is acceptable to claim for.

'We are inundated with ambulance-chasing adverts on TV for no-win no-fee services.

'If you slip on ice while you are at home you are a dozy twit - if you do it at work all of a sudden it's someone else's fault.'

Retired policeman Ray Egan, 75, 
yesterday criticised the payouts and said he was 'surprised' officers
had become part of a compensation culture 'sweeping the nation'.

Mr Egan, who served with West 
Midlands Police from 1967 to 1993, said: 'It's all to do with this claim
culture, it's like a disease and people are jumping on the bandwagon. I don't know where it is going end.

'I'm surprised the blame culture has 
spread to the police force. But everybody else is jumping on board, so 
it's just human nature.

'It's costing the country a lot of money, it could be spent on policing and put to much better use.

'It's crazy really. What we need back is the man on the beat, it's become an endangered species.

'They can't stop people claiming, it's just going to go on and on. I'm just glad I'm retired and out of it.'

In total £446,999 has been paid out by the Nottinghamshire Police to injured officers and civilian staff.

Paddy Tipping, Police and Crime Commissioner for Nottinghamshire, added: 'The force need to take a firm but fair line on this.

'Police officers when they join know 
they are taking on a demanding and dangerous role and know getting 
injured is a real possibility.

'But at the same time if the force has been negligent we need to satisfy that and pay a fair degree of compensation.'

But Phil Matthews, chairman of 
the Nottinghamshire branch of the Police Federation, defended the right 
of officers to make claims.

He said: 'You do not get thousands of 
pounds because you have tripped over something - you get it because you 
have suffered a serious injury.

'If you went to any other organisation 
that employed about 4,000 people over a number of sites and asked them 
how many claims had they had, I think we could fair quite well.

'This information does not give the details of what can be nasty, life-changing injuries. Our members should have the same rights as anyone in any other organisation.'

Meanwhile figures reveal the Humberside Police has received 44 compensation claims from officers and staff between January 2010 and March this year.

Of those, 16 claims have been successful
and ten were rejected. The others are still ongoing.

Although most 
claims had been brought by officers, some had been made by civilian 
members of staff.

John Blanchard, chair of the Humberside 
Police Federation, added most officers are reasonable and will not claim 
for compensation unless it is necessary.

He said: 'Officers are entitled to the same protection as any other member of the public when it comes to injury.

'If compensation is due, compensation is due. By the same token, I expect a level of common sense and reason.

'There is absolutely an element of risk 
in policing. The vast majority of officers will have had bumps, knocks, 
scrapes and all kinds of injuries and it won't have crossed their minds 
to claim.

'It is part of the rough and tumble of the job.'

Most officers will seek advice from the Police Federation, which runs its own claim line for officers.

Mr Blanchard said all cases are reviewed and evaluated by an independent solicitor to assess whether they will be successful.

He said: 'The force's insurers are very thorough and don't pay out unless there is some fault there.

'We will have people come to us and, if we don't think they will be successful, we will give them a reality check.

'At the end of the day, it is our members' money and taxpayers' money that will be paid out.'

Statistics: Humberside Police has received 44 compensation claims from staff between January 2010 and March this year - with 16 claims successful, 10 rejected and the rest ongoing

However, Mr Blanchard said such claims can improve safety for other officers.

He continued: 'If officers have been injured, money doesn't make it all better. It is about providing some comfort, or 
medical appliances that are needed, and it is also about demonstrating 
to the force that the right health and safety measures were not in place
and they can correct them.'

Malcolm Turner, deputy head of Nottinghamshire Police 
legal services, said the force reviewed outstanding claims every month -
with checks made by the Deputy Chief Constable.

He said: 'While some incidents may 
apparently seem to be trivial, the consequences which might flow from 
them can, on occasion, be very significant.

'Claims are handled in-house and all are
carefully scrutinised to ensure compensation is only paid in cases 
where that is appropriate and the amounts paid are in line with the 
guidance issued by the Judicial College.'

The figures have been criticised by the Taxpayers' Alliance, which argued it included 'trivial claims', such as an officer receiving £1,200 for sprains after a strap broke on some portable equipment.

Andrew Allison, spokesman for the Taxpayers' Alliance in East Yorkshire, said: 'There appears to be no doubt that the compensation culture in Britain is out of hand.

'Police officers should not be pursuing trivial claims such as when a strap breaks on equipment.

'Accidents like these happen every day. They should be leading by example and remember that taxpayers are picking up the bill.'

The details of the compensation claims were revealed following a request by The Hull Daily Mail under the Freedom of Information Act.

The response does not reveal whether the injuries were sustained while officers were responding to call-outs or whether they were on force property.
