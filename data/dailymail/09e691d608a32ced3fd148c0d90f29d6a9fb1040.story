Manny Pacquiao has branded Chris Algieri an 'okay' fighter ahead of his bout against the unbeaten American.

The PacMan will put his WBO welterweight title on the line against Algieri on November 22 but the Filipino doesn't seem to be too worried about emerging the winner in Macau.

Pacquiao, posing for photographs with his opponent in the Chinese region on Monday, said: 'He can box. I'm not saying he's really good but he's not bad. He's okay.'

'Not bad': Manny Pacquiao branded Chris Algieri  'okay' ahead of his bout against the unbeaten American

Height: Pacquiao will put his WBO welterweight title on the line against Algieri on November 23 in Macau

Ready? Pacquiao posed for photographs with his opponent in Macau on Monday and labelled him 'not bad'

Algieri will be quick to remind the confident Pacquiao of his major upset in June, as Russian Ruslan Provodnikov lost by a split decision. Pacquiao, however, watched the fight and remains unmoved.

'I saw his fight with Ruslan,'  said the 35-year-old. 'He took a lot of bad punches from Ruslan but he's tough. He can box. I'm not saying he's really good but he's not bad. He's okay.'

Algieri, at 5ft 10in, has the height advantage  over his 5ft 6.5in counterpart, which PacMan recognises. 'The biggest challenge for me is to fight another tall guy. I have to use my speed and footwork for this fight.'

Algieri started slow against Provodnikov before coming out on top - a mistake he knows he cannot afford to make against the punishing Pacquiao. 

'First round I made a mistake,' said Algieri. 'Paid for it for the next 11-and-a-half rounds. Got a little too aggressive too early against a very dangerous guy.'

'Okay': Pacquiao saw his upcoming opponent beat Russian Ruslan Provodnikov and recognises he is 'tough'

 Provodnikov and Pacquiao's trainer, Freddie Roach, remains respectful of the towering American.

'It surprised me because I actually think Ruslan won that fight. (Algieri) got beat up a little bit,' he said. 'Algieri has a good reach advantage and we're going to have to get past that and his jab. That will be our biggest problem. We have ways to do that.'

One of Roach's latest endeavours is to help Pacquiao manage his role as player-coach of the Philippines basketball team.

'We came to an agreement that four weeks before a fight he will stop playing (basketball) because of injuries. We negotiated that deal a long time ago,' he said.

'He's always busy. I don't think it's a problem.'
