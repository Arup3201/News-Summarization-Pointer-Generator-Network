Everyone knows to hold off going to the bathroom for as long as possible after a few drinks because once that seal is broken the urge to take a trip to the toilet then regularly interrupts your evening.

However, no one seems to question why our bladders fills up so quickly - particularly when consuming booze is so dehydrating.

Dr Karl Kruszelnicki has decided to explain the science behind why 'breaking the seal' is inevitable when you get stuck into a few tipples - and he also dispels the myth that balancing loads of water with alcohol will make you less dehydrated. 

Breaking the seal: The brain produces anti-diuretic hormone, ADH, to stop you from urinating - however when drinking alcohol your brain doesn't make as much ADH as is ideally needed 

Dr Karl Kruszelnicki explains why we need the toilet more often when we drink alcohol

Dr Karl says there is no 'magical' seal that holds the urine at bay inside the bladder other than the 'normal urinary sphincter'. 

In fact, it is the alcohol that interferes with the amount of hydration required for the body to produce as the the brain and kidneys work together on a 'minute-by-minute basis' to keep the bodily fluids flowing.

The brain produces anti-diuretic hormone, ADH, to stop you from urinating - however when drinking alcohol your brain doesn't make as much ADH as is ideally needed.

He said the body holds up well until the third drink.

It's at about this point when the kidneys kick in to start making a lot of urine - hence the endless toilet stops as the elbow continues to bend throughout the hours.

Dr Karl was then quick to point out that dehydration should not be taken lightly.

'Dehydration is quite serious — you can die of it,' he warns in his regular ABC science column.

He then compares the bladder to a dried-out sponge that you drip water onto until it eventually becomes drenched. 

'Add just one more drop of water on top of the sponge and now a single drop of water will form on the bottom of the sponge and begin to form a continuous trickle,' he said.

This is when the kidneys kick in to start making a lot of urine - hence the endless toilet stops as the elbow continues to bend throughout the hours 

And as logic has it - volume is also a factor as a social outing often involves consuming more alcohol than water.

'Of course, by the time you get up to a litre of beer you're getting a little bit dehydrated and your kidneys will cut back a little,' he said.

'But overall the volume of urine you generate is still greater than the volume of water contained in the beer, so you get slightly dehydrated.'

Dr Karl is the first to admit it's 'weird' that although your body is dehydrated - it produces more fluid when consuming alcohol than if you were drinking water.  

'But, because you are voluntarily taking a powerful drug called alcohol, your protective systems get out of whack,' he explains.

And he quashes the theory that if you have lots of water in combination with alcohol you won't be as dehydrated because the body will only absorb about 30 - 50 per cent of the excess water. 

'The rest just goes down the toilet bowl. You end up better off than not having drunk the extra water, but you'll still be dehydrated.'

Dr Karl's final words of wisdom about consuming copious amounts of booze? 

'You don't buy beer, you only rent it.'

Drinking lots of water in combination with alcohol won't help you be less dehydrated because the body will only absorb about 30 - 50 per cent of the excess water

Volume also factors as social events often involve more alcohol than water

Though getting dehydrated you urinate more as body is 'out of whack'
