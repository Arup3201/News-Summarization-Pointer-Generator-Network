With gale-force winds, crashing waves and an iron grey sky, the coastal town of Southsea is a bleak reminder of our dismal summer.

Yesterday the seaside resort in Hampshire was hit by choppy conditions and winds of up to 35mph.

The weekend saw unseasonal weather across the UK with temperatures dropping to 16C (61F) - five degrees lower than the average for this time of year.

Wimbledon is set to serve up a dry 
start to the championships today but, in typically British fashion, rain
had fans and players running for cover on Sunday.

Spectators awaiting the 
start of the two-week tournament ducked back into their tents as black 
clouds loomed over the All England Tennis Club.

Britain's
Andy Murray, his coach Ivan Lendl and world number three Maria 
Sharapova were seen dashing from a practice court to the locker rooms as
showers interrupted play at SW19 - and the rest of the country.

Rainy conditions left the Champions 
Trophy cricket final between England and India at Edgbaston in 
Birmingham delayed by four hours. But forecasters predict that the 
weather will improve as Wimbledon gets under way today.

Tennis fans hoping for show court tickets have pitched their tents outside the All England club in the famed Wimbledon queue

Met office forecaster Byron Chalcraft 
said: ‘The weather over the next few days will be better than we saw at 
the weekend, but there could still be some showers around.

‘It will be less windy but temperatures will still be on the low side and it will feel slightly chilly.’

However, the drizzle did not deter tennis fans
from pitching their tents outside the All England Club in the hope of 
securing coveted show court tickets.

The
Wimbledon queue attracts hundreds of people every day of the fortnight,
with people camping overnight to be first in line for some of the best 
seats.

Officials keep 500 tickets aside for each show court - Centre, Court 1 and Court 2 - each day.

The
number of people camped out on Sunday has already exceeded the number of 
tickets available for Centre Court and Court 1 tomorrow, a Wimbledon 
spokesman said.

The lucky few with tickets will enjoy
a dry and bright day on Monday, while the likes of reigning champion 
Roger Federer, Sharapova, Murray and Rafa Nadal will surely be pleased to play in 
temperatures of about 18C.

Spectators watching the tournament will be hoping not to see the court covers too many times over the fortnight

It will feel less humid than in recent days, with light winds and clouds.

Met Office forecaster David Jackson 
said: 'After weekend showers, Wimbledon is due a better start with good 
bright spells and only the slight chance of a showers until Thursday, 
although with temperatures staying on the cool side of average.

The first three days of the 
championship will be dry and bright but more unsettled as the 
competition heads into the third and fourth rounds.

Mr Jackson said: 'Thursday sees a band of rain weaken
as it moves south and Friday, the weekend and second week sees a 
greater chance of rain with changeable weather bringing more prolonged 
rain to the North and showers to the South.'

Most of Britain was hit by showers 
and cool temperatures today, with gusts of wind whipping the Blackpool 
beachfront at 46mph this morning.

Elsewhere around the country, Blackpool's sea front took a battering during high winds

The Met Office predicted showers for most of Britain tomorrow, with the south of England escaping downpours.

The rest of the week looks mostly dry
and bright with occasional showers. In Scotland, Aberdeen, Edinburgh 
and Glasgow can look forward to mid-week sunshine and temperatures of 
about 14C to 17C.

Next weekend is to see the country 
heat up again, with most places set to enjoy temperatures in the low 
twenties for a weekend of sport at Wimbledon and the British Grand Prix 
at Silverstone.

Scottish cities should enjoy temperatures of 21C to 23C, while Cardiff is expecting 24C and sunshine.

Despite the heat, the rain will return, with scattered showers and cloudy skies stretching across Britain.

Gates open for the start of 
Glastonbury on Wednesday, but the 135,000 festivalgoers will have some 
rain to contend with in between the sunshine.

Met Officer forecaster Alexander Burkill said: 'It should stay dry for the start of Glastonbury on Wednesday.

'Thursday will start off great, but it will cloud over from the west.

'On Friday there will be a few spits and spats of rain around, but it will be generally drier in the south and wetter up north.

'Temperatures should reach 21C or 22C around London later in the week which is around, if not slightly above, the June average.'
