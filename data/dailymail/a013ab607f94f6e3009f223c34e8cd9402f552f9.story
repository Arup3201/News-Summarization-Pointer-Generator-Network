He and his wife Coleen have just welcomed their second son Klay into the world, but maybe football star Wayne Rooney should set aside any hopes of retiring and becoming a stay-at-home father for a little while longer.

Just two years after spending £15,000 on hair transplant to hide his thinning locks, the England striker needs a second booster operation to conceal bald patches forming on the top of his head, according to a hair-loss expert.

The Manchester United player's follicular flaws were clear to see as he left Liverpool Women's Hospital after Coleen gave birth to Kai's brother Klay this week. And now Asim Shahmalak, hair transplant surgeon on Channel 4's Embarrassing Bodies, said the 27-year-old star would need further work to cover his new bald spots.

Rooney spent £15,000 on his first 
transplant at a London clinic two years ago. Hair was taken from the 
back of his head in individual follicles and replanted at the front

Dr Shahmalak from the Crown Clinic in Manchester said: 'It's very clear from the pictures that Wayne has kept hold of the hair from his first transplant at the front of his head.

'But he has continued to lose his hair further back on his head and on his crown. It has given him two noticeable bald patches.The best way to remedy this is with a second hair transplant.

'He also needs to start using the drug Propecia, which footballers can take quite legally without failing any drug tests. This won't help him to grow any new hair but should stop him from losing any more natural hair.'

Dr Shahmalak said that the Manchester United star inspired thousands of men to seek help with their hair - and bookings at the Crown Clinic shot up by 25 per cent.

He said: 'Wayne was really brave in being so open about his transplant. He happily tweeted pictures and told the world that he'd had it done.

'Before Wayne, men could be a bit embarrassed about admitting they'd had a transplant - but he showed there was nothing to be ashamed of.

'Wayne was very young when he had his first transplant. There is always a risk if you have a transplant before a firm pattern of baldness has been established.

'Any transplanted hair will stay for life, but you will continue to lose your natural hair - creating some inconsistencies on the scalp. It can be easily remedied with a second transplant.'

Dr Shahmalak recently carried out a second £5,500 transplant on Dr Christian Jessen, star of the medical show Embarrassing Bodies.

Dr Jessen had his first transplant in 2009 but continued to lose his natural hair because hair loss is a continual process.

Previously, he had faced Twitter taunts about his hairstyle with wounding comments such as: 'Great body, shame about the hair.'

Dr Jessen said: 'I am very pleased I had it done for a second time - it has been empowering for me.'

Wayne Rooney wrote about his hair loss in his autobiography. He admitted staring at himself in the mirror and thinking: 'Bloody hell, you're going bald and you're only a young lad.'

Coleen
tweeted after his first transplant: 'Yes waynes (sic) had his hair 
done! His own decision not me asking him, like a lot are saying!! 
Pleased for him and it will look great x.'
