Former CIA Director General Michael Hayden has acknowledged the 'human toll' taken on by CIA interrogators who participated in the use of so-called 'enhanced interrogation techniques' in the years following 9/11.

Speaking on ABC News,Hayden said he would be 'very, very disappointed if it did not take a human toll on CIA interrogators.'

Hayden said that no matter the task at hand, the people who were doing the interrogators also had feelings.

'Because after all, although that person across the table from you was a terrorist, he's also a human being,' Hayden told ABC News. 'I would not want people in the room doing this who were not affected by this.' 

In something of a split within the agency, Hayden said that he was not sure he would have approved the use of waterboarding if he had authority over its use shortly after the 9/11 attacks.

Hayden said use of the controversial tactic would have been a tough call. 

'I don't know… It depends on the totality of circumstances at the time,' he stated.

'There are certain things that are clearly permissible and then there are a bunch of things in the middle, and I would admit that waterboarding is near the edge of that window,' he said. 

'I would admit that are gray and would demand very compelling circumstances for anyone to picture themselves doing.'

Last week, Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee released a lengthy and detailed report about the use of controversial interrogation techniques, including waterboarding.

At one point, Hayden defended the controversial method of feeding detained enemy combatants through rectal tubes.

'These were medical procedures,' he said during an interview on CNN's 'The Lead with Jake Tapper,' arguing that re-hydrating uncooperative detainees this way was safer than administering intravenous fluids.

'I'm not a doctor,' he said. 'What I am told is that this is one of the ways that the body is re-hydrated.'

Hayden acknowledged that CIA interrogators might have suffered psychological traumas by using harsh tactics. 

The techniques were adopted by the CIA in the years following the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, D.C. in 2001.

Hayden still maintains that what CIA officers carried out was not torture - and that it was legal and approved by the White House, the Attorney General and select members of Congress who were briefed on the matter. 

Nearly all of the horrific behavior detailed in the Senate torture report happened before Hayden was CIA Director - though he served as head of the National Security Agency from 1999 until 2005 and then Deputy Director of National Intelligence from 2005 until his 2006 appointment as the head of the CIA.

Hayden, who led the CIA from 2006 to 2009, told ABC's Martha Raddatz he thought the use of EIT's was successful.

'They were successful. That's historical fact,' Hayden said. 'Do I support them? With regard to waterboarding, I've made it very clear that I thank God I didn't have to make that decision. I had easier circumstances when I was director.'
