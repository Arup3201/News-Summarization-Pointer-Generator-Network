He's considered one of the MLB's most promising prospects, but Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Daniel Norris has chosen to escape the hype surrounding his baseball career by living out of a 1978 Volkswagon van outside a Wal-Mart.

Predictably earning himself the nickname 'Van Man', the 21-year-old - who received a $2 million signing bonus -  has currently parked the camper outside one of the mega-stores in the suburbs of Florida, saying it brings him peace of mind.

He works out in the carpark, cooks his meals - mostly eggs and stir fries - on a portable stove and likes to go surfing during the day.

'It's like a yin-and-yang thing for me,' he told ESPN in a new interview.

'It's like a yin-and-yang thing for me': Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Daniel Norris has chosen to escape the hype surrounding his baseball career by living out of 1978 Volkswagon camper he bought for $10,000

'I'm not going to change who I am just because people think it's weird. 

'The only way I'm going to have a great season is by starting out happy and balanced and continuing to be me. 

'It might be unconventional, but to feel good about life I need to have some adventure.'

Norris paid $10,000 for the van in 2011 - straight after high school.

He refers to it as 'Shaggy'.

Norris doesn't spend all his time outside Wal-Mart.

While there, he likes to read Jack Kerouac at night using a torch, but he also goes on trips through the mountains of Tennessee and to surfing destinations along the Carolina coast.

Alternative: Beyond his quirks, Norris maintains his head is always in the game

Life on the road: With a love of the outdoors running in his family, the left-handed pitcher from Johnson City, Tennessee spends his the off-season camping in mountains and driving on the open road

He then drives to spring training in Florida.

Norris hit the major league last year and hopes to make the Jays rotation this year.  

While he has become much more well-known for his alternative lifestyle, Norris maintains his focus is and always has been the game.

'Baseball's been my No. 1 passion my whole life,' Norris told Baseball America. 

"All the stuff with the van is cool and (a good story) and that's fine, but baseball is my main focus. 

'That's my main passion and what I think about the most.'

Fan club: Daniel Norris is seen here in a photo from his Twitter page. He says he has gotten used to 'people staring' at how he camps out in carparks

Toronto Sun baseball columnist Bob Elliot recently said that, beyond his quirks, Norris has the sporting goods to back it up.

'To Blue Jays decision-makers and Blue Jays fans, it matters only if he can get people out, Elliot wrote.

'Well, so far ... so good.

'In his first start of the spring, as he tries to win a starting rotation spot, Norris worked a scoreless 1.2 'innings on Thursday night at Ed Smith Stadium, allowing two base-runners, while facing basically the Baltimore Orioles’ opening day lineup.'
