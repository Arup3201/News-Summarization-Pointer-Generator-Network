Unbeaten German Derby winner Sea The Moon has what will be his final start before the Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe when he lines up in Saturday’s Grosser Preis Von Baden.

The son of Sea The Stars is 4-1 favourite for the Arc at Longchamp on October 5 on the back of his spectacular 11-length German Derby win in July.

Christophe Soumillon rode Sea The Moon that day but with him required in France by the Aga Khan, Cristian Demuro has been called up for the ride by trainer Markus Klug.

Nearly: Sea The Moon has his final start on Saturday before he takes to the Prix de L'Arc de Triomphe

Sea The Moon, who has run four times, faces 10 rivals at Baden-Baden racecourse, the most threatening of which could be Lucky Lion.

He is the German 2,000 Guineas winner who beat Lady Cecil’s Noble Mission in a group one race last time out.

However, he left trailing by Sea The Moon in the German Derby.

Klug said: ‘He (Sea The Moon) is in good form. He is not quite 100 per cent, but we want him to be 100 per cent in October, not now.’

Back in 2011, German-trained Danedream won the Grosser Preis Von Baden before landing the Arc.
