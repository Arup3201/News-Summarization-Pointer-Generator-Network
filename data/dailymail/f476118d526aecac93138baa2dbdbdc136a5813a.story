The body of a man who drowned in the Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri on Saturday afternoon has been recovered.

Brandon Ellingson, 20, of Clive, Iowa, was being transported on a police boat on Saturday afternoon for boating while intoxicated when he stood up, walked to the edge of the boat and 'either fell or jumped overboard.'

The incident occurred at about 5:30pm on Saturday on the 3.5-mile marker of the Gravois Arm where the water was about 80-feet deep.

According to Lake News Online, Ellingson was handcuffed and wearing a life jacket when he went overboard, but according to Sergeant Paul Reinsch of Missouri State Partrol, the life jacket somehow came loose.

Reinsch told the Des Moines Register that Ellingson and the officer transporting him were the only people aboard the boat when the incident happened.

Second tragedy: Ellingson's death was the second drowning at the Lake of the Ozarks this weekend

He was studying business at Arizona State University and planned to join a family business after graduation, his grandmother told the Register.

'You know what, he was perfect. He was handsome, he was very very smart,' Gloria Ellingson said.

'He could joke with you. He could be on any level. There wasn't anybody like him.'

Ellingson's death was the second tragedy to occur in the lake this weekend.

On Friday, Adam K. Pedego, 28, drowned trying to save someone who fell off a pontoon boat in McCoy Branch Cove.
