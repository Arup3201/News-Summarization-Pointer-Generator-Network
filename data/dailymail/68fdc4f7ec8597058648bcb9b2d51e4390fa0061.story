They're the canine cuties and furry felines who have captivated television audiences all across Britain. And their antics are set to earn them – and their owners – a fortune.

The bar has been set by Grumpy Cat, the American pet whose unique sulky expression has attracted a £300,000-a-year deal advertising Friskies cat food and making personal appearances galore.

Now, with their winsome looks and quirky skills, a host of cats and dogs in this country have joined the growing number of high-earning pets. ‘The sky is the limit for these animals if they’ve got what it takes,’ predicts one animal agent. ‘Within a year those with star quality will easily be earning six-figures.’

They’ve even got their own TV show – Star Paws: The Rise Of Superstar Pets, on Channel 4 on Wednesday at 9pm.

Here, we take a look at the leaders of the pack…

Bronte the cat refuses to get out of bed in the morning for anything less that £1,000 according to her owner

Spud the dog may seem very familiar, but it is his uncle Cedric, who retired in 2007 was the Dulux dog 

Ivor the dog is a veteran of both TV and advertising whose main trick is the ability to go to the toilet on demand

Life as an Andrex puppy is particularly lucrative as they receive £750-a-day, but are too old at eight weeks 

Dodger the dog had ruff start in life as a rescue dog, but now he makes £400-a-day working on Doc Martin
