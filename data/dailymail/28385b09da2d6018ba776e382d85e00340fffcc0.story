Children should be limited to spending no more than an hour and a half playing computer games, Nick Clegg declared today.

The Deputy Prime Minister said he ‘rationed’ the time his three sons had with their games consoles and parents face a ‘heavy duty on our shoulders’ to prevent children suffering harm.

And he warned of the ‘corrosive effect’ on players’ personalities when they spend hours ‘hunkered down in front of their computer’.

Mr Clegg was challenged about the impact of computer games after yobs mugged a fan who had become one of the first to the new Grand Theft Auto V — battering him over the head with a brick and knifing him in the back.

The Lib Dem leader said his three sons Antonio, 11, Alberto eight and Miguel four played tennis and football games and not the 18-rated Grand Theft Auto.

But he warned: ‘Even for very small kids they just get very wound up with these games so you have to try and ration them a bit.

Clearly these games can have an incredibly powerful, and I suspect in some cases corrosive, effect on someone’s behaviour, someone’s outlook. 

‘They get shut off, they don’t talk to other people, they just stay in their living room, their bedroom, hunkered down in front of their computer. 

‘They occupy a sort of hermetically sealed world really of their own, and that can have a very detrimental effect.’

He said many parents struggled in a ‘frightening unknown world’, and age restrictions were not enough.

‘But
in a free country what do you do, do you start saying to people they 
can’t use it for more than x number of hours, no you can’t do that. 

‘All
parents, we’ve got a heavy duty on our shoulders, a heavy 
responsibility on our shoulders, particularly for those of us who didn’t
grow up with these games.’

Mr Clegg said he sits alongside his sons to watch what they are playing before calling time on the games.

Asked how many hours is suitable on a Saturday night, he replied: ‘Not much, about an hour and a half on a Saturday night.’

The Association of Teachers and Lecturers has carried out research suggesting video games are  increasing violence among primary school-aged children.

Alison Sherratt, president of the ATL said she was worried about the impact on children: ‘Until now, we’ve been warning of the dangers of children seeing these games, but saying it’s the parents responsibility to keep children away from them.

'We’ve had children crashing into others in toy cars in the playground. When asked about it they say they’ve been watching Grand Theft Auto. They are quite open about it — children of nine and ten.’
