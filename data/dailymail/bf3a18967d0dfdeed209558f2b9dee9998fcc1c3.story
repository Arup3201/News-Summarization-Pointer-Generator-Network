The cousin of a man accused of keeping three women as sex slaves for a decade has apologised to their families and said 'we feel your pain'.

Maria Castro-Montes is a cousin of Ariel Castro, who owned the house in Seymour Avenue, Cleveland, where Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight were imprisoned.

She said her family are 'horribly sorry' for the years of torture and abuse the three women endured.

Maria Castro-Montes, cousin of Ariel Castro and his two brothers, has apologised to the three women he allegedly held captive at his home for 10 years and told their families: 'We feel your pain'

She said the Castro family have been left devastated by the revelations about 'normal man' Ariel Castro, center, pictured with his brothers Onil, left, and Pedro Castro, right

Ms Castro-Montes told local news website Cleveland.com: 'As a family we will move past this and get through this but our greatest fear is for those three girls.'

In a direct message to the families of the three women, Ms Castro-Montes fought back tears as she said: 'From one family to another, we feel your pain. I feel horrible that these families lost their daughters for so many years.'

However, Ms Castro-Montes said no one in the family had any idea that the women had been kidnapped and held captive at the house.

She said, although she had not been in his home for years, none of her relatives ever reported seeing or hearing anything strange.

She denied that had they known, anyone in the Castro family - well known in the area - would have protected Ariel Castro.

The three women escaped the house after a decade of captivity on Monday when Amanda Berry screamed for help and kicked down the front door alongside her six-year-old daughter Jocelyn.

Police recovered Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus from the second floor and later confirmed that the women had been kept in chains and ropes for most of their captivity.

In 10 years, the women were only allowed outside twice.

Ariel Castro has been charged with four 
counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape. Two of his brothers were 
also arrested on Monday, but have not been charged in connection to the 
case.

Police announced the charges on Wednesday - two days after Castro and his two brothers Pedro and Onil were arrested.

Maria Castro-Montes said no one noticed anything unusual at Castro's home, pictured, and said no family member would have helped protect his secret

Ms Castro-Montes paid tribute to the Berry and DeJesus families for keeping their daughter's memories alive within the community.

However, she said the alleged actions of her cousins do not 'define' her family, their community or 'a race'.

She said her aunt, the mother of Ariel and his brothers, and their sister had been left 'devastated' by the revelations.

She told Cleveland.com: 'His own mother is devastated.

'His sister is devastated. He has children and grandchildren. All these people are trying to come to grips with how a man that they loved, that they cherished, that they kiss and hug and shared their lives with... and they can't fathom how this has happened.'
