'Chilling' evidence pointing to the manslaughter of Chloe Valentine has led prosecutors to appeal for her killers' to serve longer sentences, a court has been told.

The four-year-old died from massive head injuries after being forced to ride a motorbike that repeatedly crashed over a three-day period in her Adelaide backyard in January 2012.

The mother, Ashlee Polkinghorne, was jailed for at least four years and nine months while the 22-year-old's then-partner, Benjamin McPartland, 28, received four years and two months.

Chloe Valentine died at the age of four after being forced to ride a motorbike, by her parents, that repeatedly crashed over a three-day period in her Adelaide backyard in January 2012

They both pleaded guilty to manslaughter through criminal neglect.

Director of Public Prosecutions Adam Kimber SC on Thursday urged the Court of Criminal Appeal to find the sentences were 'manifestly inadequate' and 'shocked the public conscience'.

The terrified 17kg girl was repeatedly placed on a 50kg motorbike in the backyard, which fell on top of her as she crashed into a shed and pot plants several times and eventually smashed into a lemon tree.

She consequently suffered 39 injuries.

The injured child sustained black and swollen eyes, a cut to her head and bruises all over her body when ambulance officers arrived on the scene, the court heard.

However the couple waited more than eight hours before calling an ambulance, during which they smoked cannabis and went on the internet seeking information about what to do when someone was unconscious.

Mr Kimber said the sentences needed to deter both prisoners, who in future may have children or be involved with people who have them.

The sentences also needed to deter other child minders from not getting help when something went wrong.

'The child was but an infant, unable to resist getting onto the bike, unable to get herself medical care, unable to call an ambulance,' Mr Kimber said.

Anthony Allen, for McPartland, said the non-parole period of 50 months in jail was 'hardly insignificant' and the sentence sat 'squarely' within the appropriate range.

Polkinghorne was absent for the sentence appeal hearing and cited 'trauma' for not being in court, reported the ABC.

Brian Deegan, for Polkinghorne, asked what greater deterrence could his client have than to lose her only child in tragic circumstances.

'It will be trite to suggest she will not have learnt personally an enormous lesson from this incident,' he said.

'There is no greater punishment than to lose her child.'

He said no malice was involved in putting Chloe on the bike, adding 'this was supposed to be a happy episode'.

McPartland received a maximum term of seven years while Polkinghorne received eight years.

The three judges reserved their decision.
