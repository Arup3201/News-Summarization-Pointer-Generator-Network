From his seat just behind the dug-out, Teddy Sheringham saluted West Ham’s goalscorers one by one. All three had the seal of approval from the club’s new striker coach.

Their finishes were straight out of the Sheringham locker, taking English football back to a time when he had the calmest finish in the game. He could make it look so easy.

So did West Ham, strolling to victory at Selhurst Park with goals from Mauro Zarate, Stewart Downing and Carlton Cole. They were ruthless.

Off to a bad start: Mauro Zarate made matters worse for manager-less Crystal Palace by giving West Ham the lead after 34 minutes

Celebration: Zarate got West Ham going at Crystal Palace on Saturday with the opening goal before Stewart Downing added a second three minutes later

Daylight between: Downing celebrates making it 2-0 just three minutes after West Ham took the lead at Selhurst Park against Crystal Palace

‘Knowing Teddy he will probably take all the credit,’ chuckled Sam Allardyce after his side registered their first Barclays Premier League win of the season.

At times West Ham’s football was a sight to behold, with Mark Noble and the outstanding Cheikhou Kouyate zipping the ball into the feet of West Ham’s front line. It was irresistible to watch.

Sheringham has been brought into provide some invention, that little bit of craft and guile to open up teams such as Crystal Palace.

He was that type of player himself, always one step ahead of the game during a stellar career with some of the top teams in English football.

Zarate’s opener was a beaut, picking a clearance out of the sky to volley West Ham ahead in the 34th minute. It was a special goal.

So was Downing’s as he drifted in from the right, gliding past Palace’s defence and waited for the moment to bend an effort beyond Julian Speroni. They are goals worth watching again and again.

‘Teddy can do little things in groups and he has definitely added something,’ admitted Allardyce.

‘The only problem we have is the sports scientists saying he is out there too long with them: “Don’t get an injury or the muscles will tighten up...”

‘But I don’t mind him taking all the credit for it if we continue to show the quality of finishes we did against Palace.’ 

West Ham were ruthless. In a short space of time Sheringham has added another dimension to Allardyce’s attack, drawing on the creative juices of Downing, Zarate and Ricardo Vaz Te.

They needed it after last season, when the fans were on Allardyce’s back for 38 games and wanted him out of Upton Park.

But West Ham had something about them yesterday, purring when they were in possession and always threatening around the edges of the penalty area. 

Making his point: Teddy Sheringham watched on as his strikers put Crystal Palace to the sword in the comfortable win at Selhurst Park 

Decisions: Crystal Palace co-owner Steve Parish must choose his new manager after Tony Pulis's departure and caretaker manager Keith Millen (right) is in the running

This was poor from Palace, a world away from the team that Tony Pulis built and took to 11th place in the Premier League last season.

The worry for interim manager Keith Millen is that West Ham didn’t have to work too hard for this. ‘We were lacklustre,’ he admitted. Yet he deserved better than this from his players. Sure they are lacking direction and leadership while the club continue their search for a new manager, but losing Pulis is no longer an excuse. It is time to move on.

‘It has been a tough week for the club because we lost Tony in the circumstances we did and then everything happened with Malky [Mackay],’ Millen added.

Millen still wants the job full-time and he is due to speak with co-chairman Steve Parish today. Whatever happens, he will take the team to Walsall for Tuesday’s Capital One Cup tie.

He was encouraged, in part, by Palace’s start to the second half, but all the effort and commitment was shortlived.

With those Palace fanatics in the Holmesdale Road demanding more, Marouane Chamakh unexpectedly dragged them back into it with a smart goal.

Barry Bannan, who had a decent game in Palace’s midfield, sent the ball down the line for Mile Jedinak to steer in the direction of Chamakh. When it arrived the Moroccan took a touch before drilling an effort that evaded the outstretched hand of West Ham keeper Adrian. 

Given hope: Striker Marouane Chamakh got Palace back in the running with a second-half strike that made it 2-1 to the visitors

In: Chamakh of Palace scores during the Premier League match against West Ham at Selhurst Park to give caretaker manager Millen hope of nicking a point

Back in it: Palace edged their way back into the game to make it 2-1 with more than 40 minutes left to play but could not inspire a full comeback

It is a shame then that Palace sat back, inviting pressure and giving West Ham the chance to finish it off. They accepted, gratefully.

Cole had done well against Palace’s defence and his 62nd-minute goal from close range was a reward for his endeavours.

This time it was route one, a free-kick launched from West Ham’s half that Palace defender Damien Delaney failed to adequately clear. Cole reacted first to beat Speroni with an emphatic strike.

‘Everything is going against us at the moment, but this just wasn’t good enough,’ admitted Millen.

‘Until you come to matchday, you never quite know what kind of reaction you will get from your players.’

On Saturday, in his second game in charge since Pulis left, it was nowhere near good enough.

Settling it: Carlton Cole makes it 3-1 to West Ham against a Palace side whose manager left less than 48 hours before the Premier League season started

That'll do it: Cole slots past Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni to make it 3-1 on Saturday afternoon at Selhurst Park
