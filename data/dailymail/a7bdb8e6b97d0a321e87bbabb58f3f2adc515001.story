Shocking video has emerged showing the decapitated bodies of three men who were executed by a rival gang - inside a Brazilian prison.

The footage, which is too gruesome to publish, shows the inmates slumped on the floor with two heads resting on one of the corpses.

Their bodies are peppered with dozens of wounds, suggesting they suffered horrific torture before being killed.

Shock and gore: A still from video footage which shows the decapitated bodies of three inmates who were executed by a rival gang at Pedrinhas jail in north-eastern Brazil

Horrific: Their bodies are peppered with dozens of wounds, suggesting they suffered horrific torture

Brazilian newspaper the Folha de Sao Paulo, which released the footage, described how 'other prisoners posed with the bodies, showing them off like trophies'.

The video was handed to the publication by a union of jail workers to highlight the horrendous conditions which have long blighted the country's prison population.

This latest display of brutality, recorded on December 17, took place at Pedrinhas jail in the north-eastern state of Maranhao where 62 inmates were killed in 2013 alone.

The source of the problem lies in a long-running feud between rival factions from the state's capital and those elsewhere.

Just days after the beheadings, a 
judge visited the prison to demand the government seize back control of 
the site, according to CNN.

Douglas
 Martins also highlighted the extreme violence meted out on women, in 
particular female visitors who were forced to have sex with leaders of 
the gangland prisoners.

But overcrowding - Pedrinhas has 2,196 inmates but was designed for only 1,770 - is also a major issue all over the country.

According to the state-run Agencia Brasil news agency reported this week that the federal government has reached agreement to transfer the leaders of these gangs to other prisons.

In October, a violent uprising at Pedrinhas Penitentiary Complex left 10 dead and 30 injured after wardens discovered that 60 prisoners were digging an escape tunnel.

In April 2011, inmates were involved in 
one of the largest and bloodiest rebellions that lasted about 30 hours 
in the São Luis penal complex.

The revolt left 18 dead, three of them by beheading. Five prison guards were held hostage.

At one point police attempting to break into the site were held back by the convicts who threw two severed heads over the wall.

The criminals had gone on the rampage demanding better treatment saying the food wasn’t fit for human consumption and the water was polluted and rank.

Brazil is due to host next year's World 
Cup.

Maranhao is nearly 1,000km away from Fortaleza, one of the closest 
host cities, which is on Brazil's north east coastline.
