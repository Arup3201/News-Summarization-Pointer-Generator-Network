Bali Nine drug smugglers Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan could be executed within days after Australian embassy staff were called to meet with Indonesian diplomats on Monday.

A spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop has confirmed the meeting, saying other officials with nationals facing execution have also been summoned. 

This comes as family and friends say their final goodbyes to the Australians, including Sukumaran's mentor and artist Ben Quilty.

Chan and Sukumaran are expected to be moved to Nusa Kambangan - a prison island off central Java - where prisoners on death row are executed.

They will be given 72 hours notice of their execution by firing squad.

The pair were leaders of the so-called Bali Nine, who were found guilty of attempting to smuggle more than 8 kg of heroin valued at about $4 million from Indonesia to Australia in 2005.

'The Australian Embassy in Jakarta, along with a number of other diplomatic missions, has been invited to a meeting with the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday,' a spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia.

It is not yet known whether officials attending the meeting will be notified when the executions will take place.

Those who are on death row are believed to be delaying the execution date as they have to be transported from prisons across Indonesia, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. 

In previous a case, embassies were informed just 24 hours before Attorney-General H.M. Prasetyo held a media conference to announce when five prisoners on similar charges would face the firing squad.

They were executed on January 18 - three days after Mr Prasetyo spoke to the press, the Sydney Morning Herald further reports.

The Attorney-General said on Friday a date is yet to be set for the imminent executions and gave no indication to when the 72 hour notice period will commence.

Chan and Sukumaran have been disturbed by the evident preparation for their execution as prison guards broke open the lock to their jail cells to conduct a search.

During a charity event on Saturday, Prime Minister Tony Abbott made another appeal to Indonesian authorities.

'I should also just observe today that millions of Australians are feeling very, very upset about what may soon happen to two Australians in Indonesia and my plea even at this late stage is for Indonesia to be as responsive to us as it expects other countries to be to them when they plead for the lives of their citizens on death row overseas,' he said.

Artist Ben Quilty says Sukumaran is no longer sleeping as he waits with dread for a final knock on his door to take him to his execution by firing squad.

Quilty said goodbye the 33-year-old to at Kerobokan prison in Bali for the last time on Thursday.

'He knows someone will knock on his door in the middle of the night. I offered to bring him valium but he said "no". He is completely free from drugs and won't even take sleeping pills,' Quilty told ABC radio.

The Australian artist, who in 2011 won the Archibald Prize, has been Sukumaran's mentor since 2012, helping him develop a talent for painting.

The Australians who are facing execution were arrested at Bali's Denpasar airport and their case has taken on enormous resonance as a domestic political issue in Australia.

Sukumaran has begun what may well be his final painting after finding a photo of the Indonesian island where he will likely be shot and killed.

'He's found an image of the island where his execution will take place and wants to make a painting. I hope it's not the last he makes but it's the beginnings of a great painting,' Quilty said.

Sukumaran has been on death row for almost ten years but Quilty, who has been leading the Mercy Campaign for the Bali Nine pair, said on Thursday his spirits were high after Ms Bishop and Deputy Labor leader Tanya Plibersek pleaded for their lives to be spared in parliament.

But later in the day, events took a turn for the worse and their moods plummeted when it was confirmed permission had been granted to move them from Kerobokan prison, setting the wheels in motion for their death.

'By the afternoon things had gone dark, it was very bleak leaving them there,' Quilty said.

'We thought he'd be fine. I said one day we'd be sat on a veranda out in the bush smoking a pipe and drinking vodka together, now that looks like it will never happen.'

Quilty explained yesterday was the first time Sukumaran let out a tear when he said goodbye to his friend.

'The inevitability of it is brutal. He handled it better than I did.' 

A meeting on Thursday granted permission to move the Bali Nine drug smugglers on a date which will be determined on Friday.

Australia's efforts to stop the executions have so far failed, along with desperate legal bids.

Officials have been granted permission to transfer the two men from Kerobokan jail in Bali

Indonesia's Attorney-General HM Prasetyo, who hasn't shied away from commenting on the men's cases before the courts, says he won't delay with his execution plans.

Chan and Sukumaran are expected to be moved to Nusakambangan, a prison island off central Java known as 'Indonesia's Alcatraz'.

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that it understood officials have been speaking to airport authorities and Garuda - the national carrier - which has apparently agreed to fly the men to the place where the executions will take place. 

They will be given 72 hours notice of their execution by firing squad.

Their Sydney families are in Bali, where they have spent the past three weeks paying daily visits to the men in Kerobokan jail.

Over the past decade they've been imprisoned there, Chan and Sukumaran have transformed into model inmates, who have helped scores of others rehabilitate and get drug-free.
