Louis van Gaal insists that the star-studded reputation of his Manchester United’s galacticos counts for nothing and his players have to prove themselves at home to QPR.

The United boss has spent £160million in the transfer window adding the likes of Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria to a formidable attack of Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Adnan Januzaj.

But Van Gaal insists that he is not impressed by their pedigree — he is only interested in what they can now deliver for a United side without a win.

Radamel Falcao and Daley Blind both arrived at Old Trafford on transfer deadline day this month

He said: ‘What do I have to say about Falcao? What do I have to say about Van Persie? What do I have to say about Rooney?

‘They are great players, they have great records but they have to do it in the game, on Sunday. You have to show it.

‘All the Man United players have to show themselves in a team.’
