These shocking pictures show the terrible state of a six-month-old puppy, passed off as a stray by his callous owner in order to avoid paying vets’ fees, a court heard.

The calculating 44-year-old wrapped pooch
 Rory in a blood-stained sheet and told the vet she had stumbled across 
an abandoned pet.

The bedraggled dog was so seriously ill 
with mange - a skin condition caused by a parasitic mite - he was 
bleeding from numerous open sores, barely able to stand and clumps of 
fur had fallen out.

Cruel: Wendy Bowley, of Redhill, Hereford, subjected her puppy to appalling abuse, then tried to pretend he was a stray so she would not have to pay the vet's bill, the court heard

Suffering: Rory was bleeding from numerous open wounds when finally taken to the vet

Hereford Magistrates Court heard 
Bowley pretended she was a Good Samaritan in crude attempt to dodge 
paying the £600 bill for the medical treatment he so desperately needed.

She pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to an animal by failing to seek treatment and mistreating a dog.

The court heard Rory had suffered the 
painful skin condition of mange for at least three months - half of his 
young life - before Bowley, of Redhill, Hereford, finally took him to 
the vets.

On March 15, this year, she took him to Laurels Veterinary Surgery in Hereford, where she claimed he was a stray.

Chris Reed, defending, said Bowley was ‘in an incredibly difficult position’ because she simply could not afford a £600 vet bill.

He said: ‘It’s easy when you look back in hindsight and say what she should have done and could have done.

‘Mrs Bowley followed the advice she was given by a vet and sought treatment.

‘She is pleading guilty on the basis that perhaps she could have sought treatment earlier than he did.’

Bowley will be sentenced next month.
