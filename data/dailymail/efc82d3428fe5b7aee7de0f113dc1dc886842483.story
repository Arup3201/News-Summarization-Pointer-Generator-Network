Police said they have interviewed more than 100 people in connection with the murder of a popular North Carolina school counselor but refused to give any details about a suspicious neighbor the victim and her friends had tweeted about.

Newton Police Department said Tuesday they've eliminated several suspects in the case of Discovery High School counselor Maggie Daniels, whose body was discovered in her apartment on June 28.

Detectives have asked the public for any information about who she had contact with in the days leading up to her death, and have been scouring the 31-year-old's social media accounts for any clues.

According to WSOC TV, a friend tweeted to Daniels about a suspicious neighbor in August.

'Be
 careful with your neighbor you mentioned, I would really encourage you 
to take a self-defense class,' the tweet read. But police refused to 
shed any light on the tweet.

On July 8,
 Newton police released a picture showing Daniels leaving a Walmart in 
nearby Conover the day before she died, hoping to jolt people's 
memories.

Her cause of death was initially listed as undetermined, but after an autopsy, investigators ruled it was a homicide.

Last Wednesday, a memorial service was held for Daniels in the lobby of Newton-Conover High School's gymnasium.

Students
 and friends hugged each other and cried as they remembered the 
counselor. They also wrote notes for Daniels to be collected and given 
to her family.

Authorities
 immediately launched a manhunt for the killer after Daniels was found 
dead in her apartment. Her body was found around 10:30 a.m. Saturday 
June 28 in her Windsor Apartments home on West 17th Street.

On July 1,
 Newton Police Department said autopsy results suggested she'd been 
murdered though they have not released any information about cause of 
death or suspects or other leads in the case.

'The
 evidence obtained from the autopsy led us to a homicide investigation,'
 Newton Police Chief Donald Brown said at a press conference that day.

Officers arrived at Daniels' apartment complex around 9 a.m. Saturday responding to a call about property damage.

When
 they were there, neighbors alerted them to Daniels' body. Someone had 
reportedly tried to phone the teacher and went to check on her when she 
didn't respond.

A friend of Daniels' called 911 to express concern for her.

'One of my friends is in her apartment, and I think she's been in there for like a day,' the friend says in the recording.

'She was in there laying down. I didn't even want to touch her... it shook me up when I seen her.'

She reportedly had no visible injuries, but there was a broken mirror nearby.

The
 janitor at the apartment complex, Joe McCorkle, said he last saw 
Daniels around 11 a.m. Friday and was there when police discovered her 
body.

'It just 
tore me up to pieces,' he told the Charlotte Observer, adding that the 
woman he referred to as 'the schoolteacher' was 'real nice' any time he 
waved hello.

'She was a good girl.'

Daniels moved into the apartment a year ago, he said.

He said she often left her door unlocked, which was unusual for the complex, and had a boyfriend who visited one or twice a month from South Carolina.

Investigators said they interviewed several people, and also checked video from surveillance cameras around downtown Newton to try and pinpoint when Daniels was last seen alive. They were also searching social media for leads, Fox 5 reported.

The Daniels' family said in a statement Monday night that they are in shock at the tragic news. 

'We are deeply saddened by the terrible news surrounding the death of our loved one, Maggie Daniels,' the statement reads. 'Words cannot describe the grief that we are going through right now. We, as a family, have decided not to comment while there is an ongoing investigation.'

The Discovery school community also expressed their devastation as word of the popular staff member's death spread.

'Our 
hearts are definitely broken,' Aron Gabriel, the assistant 
superintendent of the Newton-Conover City Schools district, told the 
Observer.

He said she was well-respected and loved as her school's only counselor.

In 2011, Daniels was named teacher of the year by the school district.

The Notre Dame College graduate moved from the Cleveland area to North Carolina in 2005 to teach English at Newton-Conover High School and also coached the school's basketball team.

She left N-CHS to pursue a master’s degree in counseling from Appalachian State University and in 2013, she began counseling students at Discovery High School.

'It just seemed very natural to her,' Gabriel told the newspaper. 'I think she really was like a hand in a glove.'

Gabriel and his colleagues held a memorial the day after Daniels was found so the community could grieve and around 300 people attended.

'People realized they're part of a community,' he said. 'They're not by themselves.'
