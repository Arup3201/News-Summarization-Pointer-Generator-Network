Unseen home video footage of the 1986 Challenger shuttle disaster has surfaced and dramatically shows what the tragedy was like for Florida residents living right beneath the explosion.

Frances and Michael VanKulick lived in Melbourne, not at all far from Kennedy Space Center. They used a home video camera to document their thrilling experience and Frances can even be heard counting down as the take-off is about to begin.

But shortly after, something went terribly wrong and it became clear this wasn't a shuttle launch like all the others.

Scroll down for video...

How it looked to them: An eerie quiet surrounded the Florida home of Michael and Frances VanKulick as they waited to watch from their own yard the ill fated 1986 Challenger launch at nearby Kennedy Space Center

Like an average fireworks display or a military air show, the VanKluick's watched from their home as the feat of human ingenuity took place in their own back yard

'Wow, is that a bright one,' Frances exclaimed after liftoff as her husband filmed. It turned out to be far too bright

Frances lent the footage after all these years to the Huffington Post, where it's been seen by America today for the first time on Tuesday, the 28th anniversary of the disaster.

The whimsical jangling of wind chimes in the background of the video quickly becomes foreboding as it slowly dawns on the VanKulick that something isn't right.

'What the heck is that? What is that? What happened,' Frances wondered after what was at first a single rocket smoke trail becomes two--something she hadn't witnessed before

Terror: Just over their neighbor's roof, the smoke trails twisted and turned. Things went silent in the home video as the couple waited to learn what was going on

Just over their neighbor's roof, the smoke trails twisted and turned.

The VanKulicks had to wait for the television to confirm what already seems clear.

'A major problem,' Frances shouted.

'It stays with you,' Frances said nearly 30 years later. 'It's something you never forget'

'Oh God,' Michael said.

Frances told Huffington Post that the experience still stands out in her mind.

'It was just a shock,' she said from her home in Florida. Mr. VanKulick died two years ago.

'It stays with you,' she said. 'It's something you never forget.'

The cause of the accident was a faulty seal in one of the shuttle's rockets which compromised the fuel tanks.

The shuttle had no escape system for the astronauts, but it became known later that at least several of those on board survived the initial explosion.

Then-president Ronald Regan ordered a probe into the Challenger catastrophe, where it was found that poor management and a disregard of safety advice were said to have played a role in the accident.

It resulted in a nearly three-year lapse in NASA's shuttle program, with the next shuttle, Discovery, taking off on September 29, 1988.

NASA ended the shuttle program for good last year, retiring the remaining vessels and instead opting for multimillion-dollar rides on Russian Soyuz capsules to get U.S. astronauts to the International Space Station.

Private U.S. companies hope to help fill the gap, beginning with space station cargo and then, hopefully, astronauts.

Challenger was one of NASA's greatest successes - but also one of its darkest legacies.

It was initially built between 1975 and 1978 to be a test vehicle, but was later converted into a fully fledged spacecraft.

In its heyday, it completed nine milestone missions - from launching the first female astronaut into space to taking part in the first repair of a satellite by an astronaut.

But it was also the vehicle that very nearly ended the space program when a probe into the 1986 disaster found that the shuttle was doomed before it had even taken off.

Roger Boisjoly, a NASA contractor at rocket-builder Morton Thiokol Inc, warned in 1985 that seals on the booster rocket joints could fail in freezing temperatures.

'The result would be a catastrophe of the highest order â€” loss of human life,' he wrote in a memo.

On the eve of the ill-fated flight, Boisjoly and several colleagues reiterated their concerns and argued against launching because of predicted cold weather at the Kennedy Space Center.

But they were overruled by Morton Thiokol managers, who gave NASA the green light.

After the accident, Boisjoly testified to a presidential commission investigating the Challenger accident.

The group determined that hot gases leaked through a joint in one of the booster rockets shortly after blastoff that ended with the explosion of the shuttle's hydrogen fuel.

Boisjoly died in 2012 aged 73.

The launches were a common sight, but the one on January 28, 1986 was strange from the start
