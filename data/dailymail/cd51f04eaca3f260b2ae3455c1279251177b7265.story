This is the horrific moment an Australian teenage surfer's body was carried away from a beach after he was bitten in two in a shark attack.

Zach Young, 19, from the NSW coastal town of Port Macquarie, is believed to have lost both legs when the creature attacked off the coast of New South Wales.

He died of cardiac arrest after being pulled onto Campbell's Beach, near the town of Coffs Harbour, yesterday.

Horrific: This is the moment Zac Young's body was carried away from an Australian beach after a shark attack

It is the second fatal shark attack within a week off the Australian coast.

Police said Mr Young had been sitting astride his body board when the creature attacked.

'It has taken a bit of time to get him to shore and he lost a fair amount of blood on the way,' police inspector Joanne Reid told Sky News.

Commending his shocked friends who brought him to shore, she added: 'It is just a tragic, tragic incident. '

Swimmers brought the boy to the beach and began CPR until ambulance crews arrived but he died at the scene.

'Sadly he could not be revived,' said an ambulance service spokesman.

As news of the tragedy spread, Zach's friends took to Facebook with their memories of him.

Ros Ralph wrote: 'Miss you Zach. You made the world a better place. Your presence lit up the room when you entered. Your smile made a difference, and your words were uplifting.'

Brandon Erga, wrote:' Love you brother. I know youâ€™re surfing the sickest barrels in Heaven right now.'

Surf Life Saving NSW Lifesaving manager Andy Kent said this was an awful tragedy.

'The hearts of all surf lifesavers go out to the family of this young victim,' he said.

Just one week earlier, father-of-two 
Chris Boyd was killed by what is believed to have been a great white 
shark while surfing on the other side of the continent, off Gracetown, 
Western Australia.

It is not
 known what shark attacked the teenage boy off Campbell's Beach but 
local people suggested it could have been a bull shark, a particularly 
aggressive member of the species.

Local surfers have suggested that the attack was by a 'rogue' shark that would not normally be in the area.

Greg Hackfath, a team leader with the Coffs Harbour Council lifeguards, said the area where the attack occurred, known as Riecks Point, was popular with body-boarders.

'Shark attacks are rare in the area,' he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

'I can only recall, in the 35 years I've been here, two shark attacks and both of those were only little.

'It is very, very unusual.

'We don't know details of what type of shark it is yet but it could be a rogue shark that has just been travelling through the area.

'The young man could have just been in the wrong place at the wrong time. We will probably never know that.'

Police carrying body-boards were later seen escorting two young men, believed to be friends of the teenager, away from the beach.
