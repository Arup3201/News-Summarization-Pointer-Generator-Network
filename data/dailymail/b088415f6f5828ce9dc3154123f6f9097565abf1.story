The wait is almost over. And to celebrate Sam Fisher's imminent arrival, Ubisoft have released a brand new Blacklist gameplay trailer.

The video shows off the different approaches Fisher can use during missions. Ghost focuses on stealth, with the aim of completing objectives without being seen.

Panther style allows Sam to stalk his enemies and unleash fatal finishing moves. While Assault ditches the silenced weapons and focuses on an all-out attack. In this latter approach, expect the modified mark and execute mechanic - Killing In Motion - to play a central role.

He's nearly here! It's felt like years but Sam Fisher is closing in on what could be his last outing on current gen

Blacklist follows on from the events of Conviction. The President shuts down the corrupt Third Echelon, replacing it with Fourth Echelon - led by Fisher. The team is then tasked with stopping a group of terrorist calledÂ  'The Engineers' attacking the United States.

It's powered by a heavily modified version of the Unreal 2.5 engine - the same one used in Conviction. However, although its visuals didn't stand out at this year's E3, they are noticeably smoother than in its predecessor, with animation - in particular - much improved.

Not surprisingly, the PC version was the strongest - with Nvidia's latest 700 series cards making short work of the dated engine.

Xbox 360 owners can opt for Kinect functionality - with players able to make a noise to distract guards or control Sam with body movements rather than a controller.

The Wii U version uses the touchscreen as an inventory and OPSAT (Fisher's arm-mounted computer) as well as presenting thermal vision and motion tracking intel.
