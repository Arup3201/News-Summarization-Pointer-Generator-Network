The threat of a global pandemic remains one of the most serious threats to the future of the human race, but now scientists have developed a breakthrough system for predicting how rapidly an outbreak might spread and where.

Where once disease typically spread by people traveling distances on foot or by horse, modern pandemics are spread through a complex network of global flight patterns and busy aviation hubs.

By using data from the 2003 SARS outbreak and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, theoretical physicist Dirk Brockmann and his colleagues have devised a new model for predicting the arrival times of the next global pandemic in different parts of the world.

The stills illustrate a simulated global epidemic that spreads on the worldwide air-transportation network with an initial outbreak location in Atlanta, Georgia

Initially the virus spreads within the U.S., the The left panel depicts the simulation from the perspective of the outbreak location (Atlanta) and the radial distance is an effective distance compute from traffic flows in the underlying network

Now the virus has spread throughout more of the U.S. and also into Europe and Latin America: note the pattern on the left is regular, concentric and can be understood in terms of simple reaction-diffusion equations, while the pattern on the right gets more complex

The model relies on the concept of ‘effective distance,’ and the belief that contagion now travels much more quickly and effectively between busy airports in different countries than between cities and more rural areas in the same country.

‘In the modern world that’s so connected, old school, conventional geographic distance is not so meaningful anymore.’ Brockmann told Fast Company.

He and his colleagues have spent the past decade testing how ‘effective distance’ might work by building theoretical pandemics and models that predict their theoretical spread.

Three-years-worth of airline data was analyzed to see how these distances interact with the aim of developing a universal equation that would account for the arrival times of any disease across the globe.

As the outbreak continues to impact different parts of the world the pattern on the left remains regular - similar to waves created by dropping a stone in water

Dirk Brockmann have found that contagion now travels much more quickly and effectively between busy airports in different countries rather than between cities and more rural areas in the same country

Brockmann has discovered that the jumbled, erratic spread of disease, right, can be reduced to simple, constant wave patterns, left, riding on effective distances, rather than geographic ones, through a 'global mobility network'

Brockmann and his co-author Dirk Hebling published a paper in Science today, which shows that the jumbled, erratic spread of disease can be reduced to simple, constant wave patterns, riding on effective distances, rather than geographic ones, through a ‘global mobility network.’

When Brockmann plotted the SARS and H1N1 epidemics’ actual arrival times in different cities against their effective distances, he found strong positive correlations.

‘So we don’t need to know anything about the disease,’ Brockmann explained.

‘If you throw a rock into the water, you’ll see a concentric wave. If you throw a big rock into the water, you will also see a concentric wave. If you throw a rock into honey, or some different liquid, you will see a wave that is propagating slower, but it will still be a concentric wave.’

Regardless of the transmission method, Brockmann contends that his global mobility network represents the wave pattern, while the rock and the liquid show the launch and spread of the disease.

Using the global mobility network, we can see how a disease launched in one city might spread to the rest of the world. Brockmann developed visualizations of this phenomenon in Mexico City, Chicago, and London.

Unfortunately, they also show how difficult it would be to contain or quarantine an outbreak in a global city. Although now that researchers understand how the underlying process works, it could be used to help cut off critical links in transmission.
