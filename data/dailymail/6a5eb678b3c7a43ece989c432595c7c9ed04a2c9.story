Fitting exercise in to a busy daily routine can often be tricky - especially when all you want to do is slump in front of the TV.

Now, an American company has come up with a novel idea - the arm chair that gives you a full body workout - if you've got £687 ($1,095) to spare.

Called the ChairMaster, it is a comfy recliner that doubles up as a gym.

Cascade Health and Fitness created the ChairMaster to help people workout in their living rooms

It features a built-in set of pedals to allow for a low impact cycling workout, and also has resistance bands which allow for a wide variety of exercises to help increase strength, flexibility and aerobic conditioning.

The creators say the ChairMaster allows the users to do 50 different exercises and allows for lower and upper body workouts as well as for stretching exercises.

The exercises it facilitates include bicep curls, leg lifts, squats and chest presses.

The Washington-based company, Cascade Health and Fitness, believes the ChairMaster might be the healthiest available addition to the living room.

The chair comes with instructions containing information on how to use the chair to perform exercises that are aid to be particularly beneficial for people with diabetes or arthritis

It even claims to help carry out exercises that help with golfing and gardening.

Company director, John Post, said: 
‘Our goal was to create an attractive exercise product that lets 
individual's workout more often.

‘We
also wanted to give people a new way to take some of the time they 
spend sitting and doing a favourite past time, like watching television,
and turn it into a better way to exercise.’

While it might seem like an impractical way to workout, the ChairMaster’s creators say it is perfect for senior citizens or those who have limited mobility as users can exercise without putting additional stress on joints.

Candace Peters, a personal trainer at
GenCare retirement homes, said: ‘The ChairMaster is very comfortable 
for our residents, it feels like a recliner.

‘Even
getting into it from a wheelchair, they find they can put their hand 
down, pivot, and sit down. The ChairMaster is not scary to them, like 
other pieces of equipment.’
