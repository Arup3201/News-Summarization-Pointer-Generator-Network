Jamiroquai's Jay Kay was robbed of thousands of dollars during a break-in in Ibiza

Pop star Jay Kay had thousands of pounds and a Rolex watch stolen from his villa in Ibiza just hours after flying to the party island.

A gang broke into the rented mountain-top home while he was out clubbing on the first night of a ten- day break.

The Jamiroquai frontman returned from the Spice nightclub to find that the villa had been broken into.

But the thieves spurned the eccentric star’s designer gear and instead took the Rolex, which belonged to his security man, and the cash.

Police were called to the holiday villa near the upmarket resort of Cala Carbo on the west coast but  the singer opted against making a formal complaint.

He later discovered the £12,000-a-week property had already been burgled three times before.

Detectives confirmed last night they were investigating three other recent thefts at the same property – and that the suspects were still  at large.

Last night a spokesman for the singer told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Jay had a pretty unpleasant experience. When we booked the villa they didn’t tell us that they had previously been robbed. We wish they had, as Jay would have been more vigilant.

‘He had literally arrived at the villa and gone straight out. When he returned the villa had been robbed so the thieves must have seen them arriving.

Jay felt very violated but he didn’t want a full-scale police investigation – he didn’t want the hassle or the publicity.

‘Jay stayed at the villa for the  rest of the trip because they upped the security.’

Break-in: The villa, west of Ibiza town on the party island, was broken in to and the thieves got away with cash and a security guard's Rolex

The rich and famous who flock to Ibiza have been put on guard following a string of break-ins at other luxury properties.

The four-bedroom home Kay stayed at – known officially as Puig Pelat but popularly as Villa Eclipse – sits on a mountain-top between the upmarket resorts of Cala Carbo and Cala Vadella, a 30-minute drive west of Ibiza Town. It lies at the end of a dirt track and offers spectacular views of the Mediterranean.

Online luxury travel agency Paradizo, the agency Kay booked through, failed to respond to an enquiry about the earlier thefts.

One local, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Criminals of all sorts make a beeline for Ibiza every summer because they know there are rich pickings to be had.

‘There are always problems with break-ins at luxury villas but this year we’re hearing it’s been particularly bad.’
