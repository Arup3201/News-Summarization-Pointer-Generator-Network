Though sported Frank Sinatra, button down shirts can draw frowns of disapproval and some even suggest it can dash a chap’s career prospects

At last there’s an answer to the raging style debate that has male fashionistas hot under the collar: just when you can wear a button-down shirt?

Though sported by Cary Grant, Frank Sinatra and even 007, in some circles it’s a look that draws frowns of disapproval. Some even suggest it can dash a chap’s career prospects.

Now menswear store Burton has laid out the rules in a style guide. 

Its advice is: ‘DO wear a button-down for a smart/casual look – open-necked or with a thin knitted tie, with dark denim or more formal trousers.’

And holding up the ultimate male style role model as an example, the guide adds: ‘Button-downs can also be worn with a blazer – like Roger Moore did as James Bond.’

It is also permitted to wear the style with a sports coat ‘and with brogues if wearing chinos or even desert boots with a soft-shouldered suit and silk knitted tie’. 

However, wearing a button-down is not recommended for black tie events or weddings – unless dress is specified as smart-casual – and City workers and aspiring lawyers are advised they might risk their future by wearing such a garment.

The guide concludes: ‘Unless you know you can get away with it 100 per cent, don’t take chances.’

The debate may not completely be over yet though. Style guru Peter York, author of The Official Sloane Ranger Handbook, said yesterday that wearing a button-down shirt with a tie in a casual outfit was ‘classic’, adding: ‘It’s a preppy US-look.’

Robert Johnston, style director at GQ magazine disagreed, saying that it made men appear like ‘they have been dressed for school by mother’.

‘If you turned up to work wearing one then you should be sacked.’

He joked: ‘Frank Sinatra could get away with it, but he would look good in a bodybag.’
