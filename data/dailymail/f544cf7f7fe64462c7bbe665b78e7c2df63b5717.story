A burglar stabbed to death after an attempted break-in was on police bail for another burglary, it has emerged.

Earlier this month, John Leonard Bennell, 27, from Hyde, Greater Manchester was arrested in Tamworth, by Staffordshire police on suspicion of burglary.

The development comes after Peter Flanagan, 59, was arrested on suspicion of murder yesterday following the incident in Ethel Avenue, Salford. He remains in police custody this morning.

Evidence: Police surround a tent that covers the spot where the man who was stabbed was found

Two other people were also arrested, Neil Flanagan, 27, son of Peter Flanagan, and a woman, 21, but both have been released without charge today.

Mr Bennell died from a stab wound to the chest following a 'disturbance' at the house.

Four
men, wearing dark clothing and balaclavas, apparently tried to smash their way 
through the back door of the terraced house just before midnight on Wednesday.

The 21-year-old woman made a frantic 999 call for police to come to the property.

The victim was then carried away by accomplices as they fled, it is believed.

A
second call alerted officers to the victim a short distance from the 
property and he was taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Police have made an appeal to the public to try to trace his three accomplices.

The incident comes after David Cameron promised stronger support for people protecting their property from burglars.

We
will put beyond doubt that homeowners and small shopkeepers who use 
reasonable force to defend themselves or their properties will not be 
prosecuted,' the Prime Minister said.

Sylvia
Sharp-Cadigan, Mr Flanagan's next-door neighbour, said: 'I went to bed 
at 10 o'clock and about 12 heard all this commotion, all voices.

'There were four police cars outside.

'I came down and said to the police 'What's going on?'.

'He said 'There's been a break-in'.

'I said 'Is anybody hurt?' and he said 'I can't say any more'.'

Mrs Sharp-Cadigan, 67, said Mr Flanagan senior lived at the house with his son.

Investigation: The house, which has been sealed off, backs on to scrubland. It is believed that the dead man was among a balaclava-clad gang trying to break in

Neighbour Sylvia Sharp-Cadiga revealed she was woken up by the 'commotion'

She
described Mr Flanagan as a 'worker' who left early in the mornings and 
his son as a 'lad' who had a lot of visitors to the house.

She
added: 'We are all upset because it is a quiet little street, we never 
have any bother. You don't like it on your own doorstep.'

Mr Flanagan’s wife Valerie, who moved out of the home in 2000, was not at the property at the time.

She said: ‘It’s such a terrible  
incident. How anything like this  can happen to anyone I don’t know. My 
husband is a great man and a great father – it’s such a shock.’

Mr Flanagan helped Neil run a construction company in Manchester until it was dissolved in 2007.

One
neighbour said: ‘They’re just a normal family and I would never have 
expected in a million years that they would have been caught up in 
anything like this.

‘I’ve known the young lad Neil since he was born and I’ve known the family for years.'

Another neighbour said: ‘We’re such a close community around here.

'It’s just so upsetting. Everyone is really surprised and shocked. We all try to support each other.

'Neil is my mate and he’s a hard-working normal young guy. His dad is an honest bloke that has lived in the area all his life.'

The
house, part of a cul-de-sac, is next to an open area of scrubland close
to a council recycling centre in the Pendlebury area of Salford.

A large area around the house was cordoned off by police tape as detectives continued their investigation.

Forensic officers in white boiler suits could be seen entering the property and taking scene-of-crime photographs.

Chief
Superintendent Kevin Mulligan, Salford divisional commander for Greater
Manchester Police, said yesterday: 'Clearly this is a shocking incident
and a man has lost his life.

'However,
I can reassure the community that we will thoroughly investigate what 
happened last night and do not believe that members of the public are at
risk.

'I would urge anyone
who knows something to speak to officers from the major incident team 
and anyone else who has other concerns can speak to my officers, who 
will be providing an increased presence to provide the community with 
reassurance.'

Asked whether
the case raised issues over how far residents can go to protect 
themselves, he said: 'We are investigating this matter within the legal 
framework as it stands and I don't want to speculate on political 
matters at this stage.

'If 
somebody was confronted by a burglar tonight, I would tell them to ring 
the police and use reasonable force to protect themselves.'

Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil 
rights group Liberty, said: ‘This is a problem not of law but the public
understanding of it.

‘Of course people facing intruders can use reasonable force to defend themselves.

‘But
saying that “burglars leave their rights at the threshold” is a recipe 
for vigilante execution and mistaken killings of family members 
returning home after dark.’
