A dog owner recorded his heartbroken pet's reaction when he left the house - and the result might make you never want to leave your pooch home alone again.

The video, recorded on a GoPro camera attached to the animal's collar, shows the dog's owner saying goodbye to his pet and then leaving his house in Springfield, Missouri.  

The dog, named Guinness, follows his owner to the front door then whimpers and rushes to the window when it realizes its owner has gone.

The edited footage then shows the stressed out pup whining and scampering over to the front door.

Letting out sad little yelps, the loyal pooch repeatedly rushes between the rooms, before standing on its owner's bed and howling.

Guinness appears to have made himself comfortable among the covers but he still lets out long yearning howls as he gazes around the room.

The heartbreaking video, which was posted by Mike The Intern on YouTube just a week ago, has already received more than two million views. 

On his Facebook page, Mike the Intern describes the video as 'the saddest thing I've ever seen.'

He wrote: 'Literally goes straight to my bed....and cries. I've had him for six years and have never heard him howl or cry, ever. I can't leave him again.'
