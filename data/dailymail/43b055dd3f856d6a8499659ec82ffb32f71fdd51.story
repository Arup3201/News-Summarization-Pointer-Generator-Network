Philadelphia Eagles star wide receiver DeSean Jackson has been cut from the team over alleged ties to the notorious Crips street gang members implicated in multiple murders, according to a new report.

Jackson, 27, was due more than $10million for the upcoming season, but a report citing unnamed sources says the move was hardly a salary cap dump, and more a preemptive strike for a team looking to avoid the next Aaron Hernandez.

The shock announcement came Friday less than an hour after the report linked the wideout to known gang-bangers Theron Shakir and Marques Binnes, as well as explaining how even the name of his record label aligns with Crips culture.

The Los Angeles native set career highs with 83 receptions for 1,332 yards and nine touchdowns en route to his third Pro Bowl, but the team reportedly became weary of him flashing gang signs both on the field during games and in social media posts.

‘They are concerned about having him around the younger players,’ a team source told the paper.

Jackson and his agent have denied any ties to the murderous gang despite the Star-Ledger report.

The six year veteran was the subject of rampant trade rumors for the past several weeks, but the Eagles decided to instead give him his outright release, according to a team statement.

‘After careful consideration this off-season, Eagles decide to part ways with DeSean Jackson. The team informed him of his release today.’

The team was aware of Jackson’s association with the two men, implicated in multiple murders since 2010, according to the report.

But the details revealed Friday by the paper likely forced its hand – especially with NFL teams weary of ex-Patriot Aaron Hernandez suspected in as many as three murders, as well as drug and arms trafficking and gang activity.

Shakir and Binns were charged in the Dec 29, 2010 execution of a 14-year-old boy who flashed a rival gang sign at them while riding his bike through crime-ridden South Los Angeles.

The two men were accused by police of shooting the young boy multiple times, but Jackson stood by him and even posted pictures of them together while he was detained, the Star-Ledger noted.

Shakir is signed to Jackson-owned Jaccpot Records under the name ‘T-Ron.’

Jackson was not ever named a suspect in the killing, but was questioned by police. An LAPD spokesperson told the paper the player was ‘cooperative at the time,’ and in no way even suspected of having anything to do with the killing.

Charges against Shakir were eventually dropped after he sat in prison for one year awaiting trial.

Jackson, Shakir and two other men were seen in a photo posted to Instagram soon after his release. Shakir still had on his LA County Jail shirt while Jackson’s arm was around him. Shakir was still wearing a prison-issued t-shirt.

Binns was convicted of murder and sentenced to 15 years to life in prison, records showed.

Those posts and the police questioning didn’t deter the Eagles from signing the star player to a five-year, $48.5million contract extension.

About a year after this incident, another troubling gang-affiliated murder occurred in a building owned or leased by a Jackson relative, police told the Star-Ledger.

Documents including a gun permit and a car title were found in the building where the killing occurred, but Jackson was not tied to the crime.

The Jaccpot record label, at which Shakir is a signed artist, is said to be spelled in Crips-style – spelling it as Jackpot would be against gang rules since ‘ck’ in any use stands for Crip Killer, an expert told the paper.

Jackson has publicly defended the name of the label by saying the ‘jackpot.com’ domain was previously taken.

'Rolling 60's': Jackson has been photographed many times flashing the contorted C signal used by members of a local Crips gang from the Crenshaw neighborhood he grew up in - he even flashed the supposed gang sign at Washington Redskins player DeAngelo Hall on national television last season

Snoop Dogg, a hip hop artist long-known to make references to the Crips in his music, released a song on Jaccpot with Jackson in a music video flashing hand signals similar to the gang signs flashed by the Rolling 60’s neighborhood Crips, a gang expert told Larry Brown Sports.

Jackson also flashed the same ‘contorted c’ hand signal at the Washington Redskins’ DeAngelo Hall after making a big catch during a game early last season – on national television.

‘You don't want to see anybody throwing up gang signs like he did in the Redskins game last year,’ an LAPD gang expert told the Star-Ledger. 

‘Those were neighborhood Crip gang signs and he flashed them during a game,’ the expert continued. ‘He may not be affiliated with the gang, but they don't [ordinarily] take kindly to those not in the gang throwing up those gang signs.’

The boisterous receiver then wrote ‘10mode 1-0 to start .. Keep Rollin,’ in an Instagram post after the game.

‘DeSean Jackson is not a gang member,’ EAG Management CEO and founder Denise White, Jackson’s agent, told the paper. ‘He’s far, far from it.’

Jackson was not made available for comment, but did offer the following statement posted to Facebook by ESPN reporter Adam Shefter.

‘I would like to make it very clear that I am not and never have been part of any gang,’ said the embattled footballer. ‘I am not a gang member and to speculate and assume that I am involved in such activity off the field is reckless and irresponsible.’

Players have had mostly negative reaction to both the report and the release.

‘Something isn't right with this DeSean/Eagles situation. Doubt it had anything to do with gang stuff,’ tweeted New York Giants linebacker Spencer Paysinger.

‘It's hard to believe some people are trying to draw a connection between [Jackson] and Aaron Hernandez,’ former Eagles running back Brian Westbrook tweeted.

Jackson’s former coach at Crenshaw High School also defended him, saying there was never any inclination of gang activity and even chalked his rowdy behaviour up to wanting to play up a tough image for the music label.

Jackson has never been convicted of any crime outside of a guilty plea in April 2010 to a charge of disturbing the peace.
