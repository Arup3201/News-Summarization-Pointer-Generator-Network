Beach goers swimming in areas concealed by shark nets may not be as safe as they think they are, according to a report that claims many of the nets ‘have huge holes easily big enough for a shark to pass through’.

Many of the nets which partially cover NSW beaches are ‘tattered and twisted’ Channel 7 revealed, during a report which showed marine life such as Eagle Rays and Shortfin Mako Sharks stuck in the ineffective barriers.

In the shocking underwater footage various sealife are seen dead and decaying in the nets as one Ray was set free by the Channel’s cameraman.

The broadcast named Bondi Beach in Sydney, one of Australia’s most popular beaches, as boasting the most ineffective shark nets.

‘The nets at Bondi are in the worst condition by far, with tangles and tears — and they only cover one fifth of the beach,’ Channel 7 reporter Matthew Snelson said.

The report follows a number of beach closures in recent weeks due to shark sightings, including fears of shark attacks at Newcastle, Manly, Port Kembla and Windang near Wollongong.

According to the NSW Department of Primary Industries, a total of 51 ocean beaches from Wollongong to Newcastle are currently netted between 1 September and 30 April each year.

The nets are ‘sunk nets’ set below the surface in about 10 to 12 metres of water, within 500 metres of the shore and are fitted with acoustic warning devices to alert dolphins and whales.

The Department’s website warns: ‘While shark attacks are exceptionally rare events, there is a risk inherent in swimming in any waterway. The only way that you can 100 per cent guarantee you will not have a shark encounter is not to go into the water.’

Although shark nets are in place at many beaches in NSW and Queensland, the most common type of net is not actually designed to act as a shark barrier.

'The program protects around two million people who swim at these beaches each year,' a Department spokesperson said.

'The nets do not stretch from one end of a beach to the other. They are not designed to create a total barrier between bathers and sharks. They are designed to deter sharks from establishing territories, thereby reducing the odds of a shark encounter,' they added.

However, great white sharks are a protected species and must by law be released if found alive in shark nets or on drumlines.

In November, two great white sharks were found dead in nets just 400m off the coast of Bondi on separate occasions.

The spearfisherman who spotted the shark said: 'It's not so great when they're dead and laying on the bottom in a net'

Ian Puckeridge, who works as a spear fisherman, spotted one shark lying dead in the net, Channel Seven reports. 'It's quite awesome to see them in the water when they're alive, not so great when they're dead and laying on the bottom in a net,’ Puckeridge told Seven.

The other shark was picked up by a contractor boat on behalf of the Fisheries department and taken from Bondi to the Fisheries wharf in Sydney harbour where it was unloaded into a container to be taken for testing and an autopsy.

Photos taken by a witness on a nearby boat show the shark, hung from its mouth, being winched in the air by men in hard hats and high-vis jackets at the wharf.

Witness Nick Wenham told Daily Mail Australia: 'It was definitely from Bondi Beach. It's a 2.5-3m great white that needed to be taken to the Fisheries for testing because it's a protected species.' 

'It was dead with its tail removed. We followed the boat from Bradley's head in the harbour up to the fisheries where I took the pictures.

'The shark went into the container behind and they shut the doors as soon as it was in,' Mr Wenham added.

'The tail was on the back deck,' he pointed out.

The Humane Society of Australia is one organisation that is campaigning against shark nets, which they label ‘indiscriminate killers’.

‘In late 2013 in NSW a humpback whale calf and a dolphin were both caught and drowned in the shark nets. In 2010 reports indicated more than 4000 animals had been killed in NSW.

‘In November 2009 in NSW alone two threatened species, a great white shark and a dugong were trapped and killed in the nets. In Queensland 16 dolphins, 6 whales, 1 dugong and 30 turtles were caught in shark nets in 2009,’ the Society claims.

Michael Kennedy, director of the Humane Society International Australia, told Daily Mail Australia shark nets 'are old fashioned and cruel and should be to be taken out'. 'In theory if it is alive they are supposed to release them but if it died it should be used for research so it didn't die in vain,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'Groups like ours are totally opposed to shark nets … research recognises that they are a key threat to a whole range of species… but they are scared of what would happen if they are remove the nets,' Mr Kennedy said.

'Even people whose sons and parents have been killed in the surf don't want revenge killings … I think that is the attitude today in Australia.'

In some parts of Australia, such as selected Sydney Harbour beaches, a different type of barrier made from smaller mesh and/or vertical steel bars is in place. This type of net is thought to act as a more effective and less harmful barrier.

Aerial patrols are also in place at many popular beaches to search for sharks that are near the shoreline, with a siren issuing warnings to swimmers to exit the water.

Sharnie Connell, the founder of campaign group No NSW Shark Cull, told Daily Mail Australia that there are ‘lots of alternatives to shark nets already on trial all around the world.’

In South Africa, electromagnetic rods are being tested as a way to deter sharks. They are also trialling a different type of net that doesn’t entangle marine life.

The Bondi Beach shark nets are situated around 400 metres from the shore 

‘The nets are deployed each day and removed and monitored each day,’ Connell said. 

‘In South Africa they have a shark spotter’s programme, they have volunteers… and have a series of flags they put up if one is sighted,’ she explained.

Another system that has already been trialled at Sydney Aquarium uses sonar to detect sharks in the area and sends message to lifeguards to tell people to get out of the water.

‘I just want to see them not killing marine life... we'd like to see them trial a few different kinds of methods.

‘Some methods will be suitable for different beaches ... make them safe for people and marine animals,’ she added.

‘The fact is that the ocean is a shark’s territory. Sharks are a natural and important part of the ocean environment, and when we enter open waters we are entering their domain – not a swimming pool.

‘No program or combinations of programs can ever totally eliminate the risk of a shark attack,’ the NSW Department of Primary Industries website informs.

Concerned swimmers are advised to stay between the flags when swimming at the beach, where the area is patrolled by lifesavers and lifeguards.
