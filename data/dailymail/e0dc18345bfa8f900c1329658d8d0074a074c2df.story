Ahead of his landmark 100th England appearance, Wayne Rooney has been given commemorative boots with '100' printed on them to mark a special century.

The striker, who should join the 100 club on Saturday in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia, posted the picture of him holding the boots on Instagram, and had a special message to supporters.

Rooney said: 'Never prouder than representing my country. Looking forward to my 100th cap on Saturday. Thanks to @nikefootball for the new boots #hypervenom'.

As we lead up to the landmark appearance, Rooney's team-mates past and present have paid tribute to the skipper.

Rio Ferdinand, Manchester United defender between 2002 and 2014, said Rooney was a better player than Cristiano Ronaldo. 

Speaking in an exclusive with The Sun, Ferdinand says: 'It's hard to explain just how much excitement there was at Old Trafford when he [Rooney] joined us.

'He signed a year after Cristiano Ronaldo but Rooney was the better all-round player.

Meanwhile, England team-mate Leighton Baines said the pressure placed on Rooney’s shoulders is greater than any of his international team-mates and that he frequently provided the goods.

'Sometimes it’s not until later on that people get the credit they deserve,’ said Baines. 'If Wayne can keep fit, keep playing, he’s going to break more records.

Rooney is just six shy of England's record goalscorer Sir Bobby Charlton and his total of 49
