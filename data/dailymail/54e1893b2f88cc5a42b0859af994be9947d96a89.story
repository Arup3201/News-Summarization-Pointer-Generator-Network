The New York train that crashed yesterday, killing four, as it whipped round a bend flew off the tracks because of 'human error', it was claimed today.

Three of the dead were flung from a carriage as the suburban service ploughed down an embankment towards the Hudson River in the city's Bronx at 7.20am. Sixty three people were injured, 11 of them critically.

The driver of the train is believed to have survived the horror as investigations into its cause began.

'It’s definitely human error,' a source told The New York Daily News. 'The speed was excessive.'

Passengers on board backed the claim, saying the train was speeding as it approached the curve in the tracks moments before the tragedy unfolded.

'The guy was going real fast around the turns and I just didn't know why because we were making good time,' Frank Tatulli told The Sun.

Dianne Jackson backed his claim, saying: 'The driver was going around the curve really fast. Next thing you know we we're in the middle of a wreckage.'

Joel Zaritzky described the moment the train was derailed.

'I was asleep and I woke up when the car started rolling several times.

'then I saw the gravel coming at me, and I heard people screaming. There was smoke everywhere and debris. People were thrown to the other side of the train.'

It comes as the engineer of the Metro-North train from Poughkeepsie to Grand Central Station told police detectives that 
he tried to apply the breaks before the accident - but they did not 
work.

William 
Rockefeller Jr, 46, a 20-year veteran engineer in good standing with the transportation 
agency, was among the nearly 70 people injured in the crash, which left 
four passengers dead.

Speaking
 to detectives, Mr Rockefeller reportedly insisted that faulty equipment
 aboard the train was to blame for the derailment because he was unable 
to slow down before a dangerous curve.

William Rockefeller Sr. defended his son to the New York Post, saying 'he’s one of the better engineers, the most dependable. And he really does like trains.'

The engineer's uncle, Jan Timothy Rockefeller, sounded a similar note in an interview with the New York Daily News, telling the paper that his nephew has always been very safety-conscious.  

'If he said the brakes failed, the brakes failed. He doesn’t lie,' Jan Rockefeller said.

Meanwhile, the
 death toll in the New York Metro-North train crash could rise - with 
investigators looking for more bodies trapped under the wreckage.

The violent derailment sent people flying through the train cars - some were even ejected from them - as windows smashed open, dirt and gravel shot inside them and the seven car train was left scattered around the tracks like a toy set.

'One woman seemed like she had lost most of her head,' a survivor told the Post. 'The side of the car was just covered in her blood.'

'[The dead woman] was flung out of the car,' she recalled. 'I used my yoga mat to cover her body. I’m probably still not processing it.'

'It was just a bloodbath,' an FDNY rescuer told the New York Post. 'This is the worse accident scene I’ve ever worked, there was blood everywhere.'

This evening, information slowly began to trickle out about the four deceased victims - two men and two women.

One
 of the victims has been identified as 58-year-old Jim Lovell, the 
husband of Philipstown Deputy Supervisor Nancy Montgomery and a father 
of four.

Lovell and his wife lived in Cold Spring with their four children.

Philipstown.info described Mr Lovell as a professional writer who was active in the Democratic Party.

The other three victims have been 
identified tonight as James Ferrari, 59, of Montrose; Donna Smith, 54, 
of Newburgh, and 35-year-old Ahn Kisook, of Queens.

NTSB
 spokesperson Earl Weener said investigators expect to be on the scene 
'a week to 10 days' investigating the cause of the deadly crash.
