Barcelona kicked off the biggest week of their season in style by beating Eibar 2-0 thanks to a Lionel Messi double that took him past Cristiano Ronaldo as La Liga’s top scorer this season.

Barca play Manchestser City on Wednesday, just four days before the decisive Clasico against Real Madrid at the Camp Nou next Sunday, and Messi led them to victory with his 31st and 32nd goals of the season. 

He even scored a goal he had never scored before in La Liga – a header direct from a corner.

The Barca star scored his 16th and 17th La Liga goals of 2015 as his side strolled to victory

At the start of the year Ronaldo collected the Balon d’Or and sent an ‘I’m coming for you’ message to Messi who has one more World Player award than the Portuguese. But instead it has been Messi pursuing, catching and over-taking Ronaldo in scoring stakes in Spain.

The Real Madrid striker was 12 goals clear of Messi but the Barça number 10 has scored 17 goals in 10 games since the turn of the year and is now in top spot like his team.

This was the first time Eibar had played Barcelona in Spain’s top flight – it is with the Catalan club that the contrasts are most stark. They have 5,250 supporters crammed into the league’s smallest ground while Barça’s 99,000 capacity Camp Nou is La Liga’s largest.

Barcelona’s budget runs to €540m euros, Eibar’s is €16m; Barça make €140m from their television deal, Eibar make €14m; Barça’s sponsor Qatar Airways pays them €35m a year while the minnows are paid €130,000 by a local steel company.

On the pitch there are massive differences too. And the home team came into the game having scored 34 goals – six fewer than Messi. Although it was the Argentine who got the opening goal Barça had to suffer for the breakthrough.

They almost scored with their first attack when first Messi and then Ivan Rakitic went close after Luis Suarez and Adriano had combined down the left. But with a relatively inexperienced midfield trio of Sergi Roberto between, Rafinha and Rakitic, and faced with a five-man Eibar defence, the first half hour was heavy going.

Luis Enrique had decided not to risk Javier Mascherano who was a booking away from missing next week’s Clasico but his presence in a midfield already missing the injured Sergi Busquets was keenly felt at times as the leaders failed to control the game.

Messi left five Eibar players behind with one dribble that started inside his own half but the move broke down as soon as he played in a team-mate and Eibar remained on level terms. Resistance was finally broken on the half hour when Suarez went on a driving run into the area and released Messi.

His shot cannoned off a defender and hit the arm of Eibar defender Borja Ekiza. The referee pointed to the spot and although keeper Jaime Jiminez dived the right way Messi’s penalty beat him.

The goal sent him one goal past Cristiano Ronaldo in the top scorer list in Spain. It’s been an incredible turnaround since the Real Madrid striker raced to a 12 goal advantage over his nemesis earlier in the campaign.

Neymar might have doubled Barça’s lead but Messi’s cross from the byline was cleared before it reached the Brazilian and Eibar made it to the break just the one goal down.

Messi was at his very best at times and made a sensational 70-yard run during the first half

Messi set up Barcelona’s first chance of the second period when he slipped Neymar through in the six-yard box only for team-mate to try and fail to nutmeg the goalkeeper.

Having failed to create the second he scored it, and with the most unusual of Messi goals. Rakitic took a corner from the right and Messi found space 10 yards out. His header down skidded off the turf and past a defender on the line to make it 2-0.

There was time for 35-year-old Xavi to come and make his 750th appearance for Barcelona as the visitors saw out the remaining minutes. Federico Piovaccari hit the bar but Barcelona took the points to mean they stay top a week ahead of the Clasico and four days ahead of the visit of Manchester City.
