Instagram's billionaire co-founders celebrated their firm's mega-money sale to Facebook by partying the night away at a Sin City superclub - with a picture posted on their app to prove it.

Multimillionaires Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, who last week sold their photo-sharing service for a staggering $1billion, 'rocked out' as details of their deal continued to sink in.

Pictured at dinner with superstar DJs and producers Deadmau5 and Avicii at Wynne and Encore Las Vegas' Botero restaurant, the pair then moved on to the celebrity haunt of Encore's XS nightclub.

They were said to be clearly enjoying the limelight as the club's managing partner Jesse Waits appropriately posted a picture of the group via their app.

But their antics all looked a bit tame, especially considering they have now entered into the league of the 'super-rich'.

There was no suggestion the 26-year-olds splashed out $150,000 on the world's biggest bottle of champagne, the 30litre Armand de Brignac 'Midas'.

And it seems they didn't blow $3,000 on a private table at the venue - a favourite for, among others, Khloe Kardashian, Ryan Seacrest, Kelly Osbourne and Gerard Butler.

They even went to bed on Saturday morning at a relatively early 4am, after sneaking backstage to watch DJ Avicii in action.

But maybe they were just tired, having capped a remarkable seven days.

Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg announced last week he would hand over $1billion to buy the company.

The app, which allows users to alter and post images on their smartphones and tablets, will be paid for in cash and Facebook stock. Facebook will complete its initial public offering of stock next month.

The service - used by 30 million people, including celebrities Hilary Duff, Mandy Moore and Jessica Alba - is increasingly becoming a rival for Facebook, which also relies on people posting pictures.

The deal comes just days after the service began offering a version for Android phones in addition to its popular Apple app.

Interestingly, it also comes eight years after Systrom turned down Mark Zuckerberg's offer to join the Facebook team in 2004 - before it shot to success.

Mr Zuckerberg said he would keep Instagram running separately and users will still be able to use it on rival social networks, such as Twitter - yet experts predict the deal could be the death of the app.

Facebook has had a tendency to buy small startups and integrate the technology - or shut it down altogether.

One thing is certain, Instagram's co-founders have now joined the leagues of the super-rich. Both are Stanford graduates, yet did not meet at university.

Instead, their paths crossed after Systromm, who had worked for Google's Gmail and a start-up that went on to become Twitter, created a photo sharing app called Burbn.

Krieger was an early Burbn user and reached out to the creator. As the CEO, Systrom is the more vocal of the duo, appearing as the face of the company to laud the application's simplicity and sociability.

Throughout university, he developed two main interests - food and photography - with his Facebook profile boasting evidence of both.

Yet it was the photography angle he chose to develop, creating services that made photo sharing easier, even as just an 18-year-old undergraduate.

But he has not entirely abandoned his love of food, taking photographs of long cooking sessions, enjoying a recent dinner with British chef Jamie Oliver, and admitting on Facebook that 'champagne' is one of his favourite things (and he'll be able to afford a few extra bottles now).

Both men's profiles hint that they enjoy the finer things in life - Systrom, who was in fraternity Sigma Nu while at university, listing bowties and corduroy among his interests, while Krieger is pictured alongside vintage cars - and during a recent meeting with Michelle Obama.

And now the co-founders will be able treat themselves - as will the venture capital firm Benchmark Capital who invested early and now owns an extremely lucrative portion of the company.

The Stanford graduates met each when Systrom, then working for Google, set up a photo sharing service Burbn. Krieger was a fan. Fifteen months ago they founded Instagram.

On the company blog, Systrom wrote how he and his team are 'psyched' about the deal.

He also reassured users that Facebook would not stop the Instagram app - instead it will continue to exist independently of Facebook.

'Instagram is not going away,' he wrote. 'We’ll be working with Facebook to evolve Instagram and build the network.

'We’ll continue to add new features to the product and find new ways to create a better mobile photos experience. The Instagram app will still be the same one you know and love.

'We’re psyched to be joining Facebook and are excited to build a better Instagram for everyone.'
