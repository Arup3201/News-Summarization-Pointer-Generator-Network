Inquest: Jonathan Gammon died alongside his pet dog after his Toyota Yaris was overcome by water

The widow of a respected judge has told how he drowned in their car after a satnav directed her into a heavily flooded ford.

Jonathan Gammon died alongside his pet dog Gabby after his Toyota Yaris was overcome by water and swept more than 100 metres downstream.

His wife Priscilla Turner managed to escape and when she was helped out of the river she told her rescuer: ‘I’ve killed my husband’.

An inquest heard yesterday how she had been driving her husband to work when the satellite navigation system sent her into a swollen ford in Headley, Hampshire.

Mr Gammon, 52, worked as a mental health tribunal judge and the couple were travelling to the Thornfield Park Hospital, a secure hospital for men detained under the mental health act.

His wife said that they had not driven to the hospital before and they had set the satnav before leaving their home in April earlier this year.

Although it was sunny on the day of the accident there had been heavy rain in the days before dangerously swelling the normally placid River Enborne.

Soon after entering the ford the car became submerged trapping the couple and their pet spaniel inside.

Location: The scene approximately two hours after Priscilla Turner drove into a heavily-flooded ford in Headley, Hampshire, while following the directions of a satnav, leading to her husband drowning

Miss Turner, 55, from Teddington, South West London said: ‘I remember driving into the water but the water looked deceptive to me, it just looked quite shallow.

‘The next thing I recall was water coming into the car.

‘I do not recall whether the car was stationary or was moving. I do recall Jonathan trying his window and it wouldn’t open, he tried the door and it wouldn’t open.

‘I recall him calling the emergency services and he was getting quite frightened.

‘He was a cautious man, he took things seriously, he considered his moves carefully and he would get anxious. I remember saying to him “Stop panicking, I will sort things” and I had a belief I would get us out of danger.

‘The next thing I recall is standing on the bank and looking down on the submerged car.

‘I remember getting into the ambulance as I asked if Jonathan was okay and I remember them saying “They are working on him now”.’

She added: ‘I just remember Jonathan’s last words, his fear, his panic.

‘I do not know how I got out of the car, I always thought I was pulled out until quite recently.’ 

The inquest heard how a car can be moved 
by just six inches of water and a ford can change depth by up to three 
metres in as little as 20 minutes.

Priscilla Turner, Mr Gammon's wife

Dorothea Ryan, who lives locally, was walking her dog when she saw the submerged car and Miss Turner standing in the River Enborne.

She told the inquest in Alton, Hampshire, that she could see water ‘rippling’ over the roof of the vehicle.

Mrs Ryan described how she waded into the water to help Miss Turner.

She said: ‘It was a bit un-nerving, I am fit and strong but I thought “What if I go in?”.

‘Priscilla grabbed my hand, she was in an awful state, she had lost a shoe, she was soaked so I got her out of her coat.

Accident: His wife said that they had not driven to the hospital before and they had set the sat nav before leaving their home in April earlier this year

‘She was saying “Oh my god, my husband, my dog, what happened, please tell me it’s a dream”. I said: “No, it’s a nightmare”.

‘The woman was very polite saying “Thank you, thank you”.

'Priscilla was saying "Oh my god, my husband, my dog, what happened, please tell me it’s a dream". I said: "No, it’s a nightmare"'

Dorothea Ryan, Headley resident

‘We just held each other, she was crying, I was comforting her.

‘She was in total shock, she said “I’ve killed my husband”, I said “No, it was an accident”.’

Another resident, Peter Hemmings, who also witnessed the incident, said that drivers frequently got into difficulties at the ford having followed satnav directions.

He said: ‘It is an open road, it appears on the satnav as a road without showing the ford.

‘We have to warn people visiting us not to use the road.’

High water level: Although it was sunny on the day of the accident there had been heavy rain in the days before dangerously swelling the normally placid River Enborne

The inquest heard how retained firefighter Jack Bancroft made a ‘dramatic’ rescue attempt by climbing on to the car roof top using a ladder and smashing the windows to get Mr Gammon out.

'What you drove into was quite extraordinary, it’s incredibly deceptive. It’s an appalling set of circumstances, an appalling situation'

Andrew Bradley, North Hampshire Coroner

He said: ‘I was able to open the door, it was a struggle and I was using a lot of strength because of the force of the water.’

The inquest heard that the cause of death for Mr Gammon was drowning.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, North Hampshire Coroner Andrew Bradley said to Mrs Turner: ‘What you drove into was quite extraordinary, it’s incredibly deceptive.

‘It’s an appalling set of circumstances, an appalling situation.’

After the accident a sign was placed at the ford stating: ‘Idiots with twatnavs, meet thy doom’, although it has since been removed.
