Angel di Maria has rubbished claims his move to Manchester United was money-orientated, revealing he is proud to play for Louis van Gaal's side.

Di Maria made the £60 million move from Real Madrid to Manchester United in the summer, leaving Champions League football behind in the process, but revealed that he is relishing the chance to pull on the United number seven shirt.

'I have these amazing feelings about having moved to Man U,' Di Maria told the Sunday People. 'I'm so proud of myself, you know. It's hard to explain it and put it into words.

Manchester United playmaker Angel di Maria has made an excellent start to life at Old Trafford

His move from Real Madrid took away his chance to play Champions League football this season

'I truly wanted to move to United. I wanted to wear this shirt. (The number seven shirt) was worn by some of the greatest players in the club's history and I do know that it is a huge thing for all Man United fans.'

The Argentinian has scored three times in his first seven appearances for the Red Devils, and team-mate Marcos Rojo went as far as touting him for the Ballon d'Or in a recent interview.

'I think people here are happy with me,' Di Maria continued. 'So I must honour this shirt. I must confess that I had all these expectations - but Man U have exceeded my expectations. It has all been perfect for me so far.'
