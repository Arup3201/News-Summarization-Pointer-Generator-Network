Meet 'Mr Cool' - also known as Kim Jong-un, North Korea's power-crazy leader who has stepped out in a pair of tinted sunglasses.

The reclusive dictator's new look is an unprecedented departure from the look fashioned by his tyrant grandfather Kim II-sung, continued by his father Kim Jong-il.

The move has sparked rumours North Koreans will be forced to don the quirky accessory, coming just months after Kim ordered them to copy his trademark hairstyle.

Kim Jong-Un delivers a speech in Samjiyong, North Korea where he sports his new look; tinted sunglasses.

While his father, Kim Jong-il, had an array of tinted spectacles for medical purposes, this is said to be a fashionable reinvention.

Kim stepped out in his sunglasses when he visited the Samji Monument at Mt Baekdu this week.

Observers said they were convinced the new leader's choice is for appearances only.

South Korean media quoted observers as saying today that they believed Kim Jong-un, marking his third year in power, was trying to shape his own distinctive image after being made over into a clone of his grandfather in a bid to lend legitimacy to the young leader.

But he's not doing it alone.

One source said it was believed that Kim's younger sister, Yeo-jong, has been co-ordinating his wardrobe since he ordered the execution last year of his mentor, Jang Song-taek.

Observers believe Kim's new glasses are part of his attempt to create a new individualist image for himself

The look seems to be a reinvention of the tinted glasses his father, Kim Jong-il, wore for medical purposes. The 'quirky' fashion is a far cry from the monotone uniform devised by his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, during his reign

But the new touch, following a look worn by celebrities such as Elton John, is thought to be his most distinctive yet.

While Kim is continuing to flex his 
muscles - and now turning heads with his new look - his push for added 
power has come at the expense of a building in one of his luxury villas.

Just
 three years after it was built as part of Kim's instructions to his 
workers to spread his real estate throughout the country, the roof of a 
vast aquarium has collapsed, according to satellite photographs.

So-called 'spy cameras' have taken images that reveal faults in workmanship by teams of North Korean military builders.

The new look has sparked rumours Kim could make fashion tweaks to his citizens' uniforms

A Google Earth photograph of the huge aquarium in the luxury villa complex in Wonsan, captured in 2012, shows a vast circular domed roof.

But an image from a South Korean satellite, captured in March this year, reveals that the roof has gone - and presumed to have collapsed.

Kim had the aquarium built with materials imported from Germany and Italy, then filled it with Â£2 million worth of marine life, including dolphins brought in from China.

The fate of the dolphins and other fish is not known.

South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper said today that according to North Korean defectors, military engineers are responsible for building the villa complex.

Kim has engaged in a massive construction drive, they say, since he came to power - and the push for speed is leading to faulty construction.

According to one source, 'Once Kim Jong-un sets a completion date, there is no arguing. The frantic push to meet deadlines is everywhere causing problems with quality.'

Those observations raise questions about the safety of a vast ski resort, Kim's 'pet project', in the Masik Pass.

Kim insisted that the project be rushed through to completion by October last year to coincide with the 68th anniversary of the formation of the Korean Workers Party.

One propaganda banner at the resort while building work was still continuing read: 'Full attack. March Forward. Let's Absolutely Finish Building Masik Pass Ski Resort Within This Year By Launching A Full Aggressive War and Full Battle.'
