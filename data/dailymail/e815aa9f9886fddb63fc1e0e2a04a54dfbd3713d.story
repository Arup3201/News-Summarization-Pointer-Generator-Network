Bill Organ’s sight was saved by injections of the drugs Avastin and Lucentis. 

Without them, the retired submarine captain would have lost his central vision — including his ability to recognise faces, drive, watch TV, or read books.

Both drugs stop the loss of central vision caused by age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness.

‘The wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in my right eye was picked up shortly after I noticed problems with my sight. I had started seeing straight lines as wavy ones, said Bill Organ, aged 71

The condition, which affects 500,000 people in the UK, comes in two forms: the ‘dry’ form, which progresses slowly, and for which there is no treatment, and the ‘wet’ form, which affects one in ten AMD sufferers. 

The latter form is more rapid, and can rob a person of sight within weeks or even days.

Wet AMD, which Bill, 71, was diagnosed with five years ago, develops when abnormal blood vessels form underneath the macula — the central part of the retina responsible for seeing fine details — and damage its cells.

‘The wet AMD in my right eye was picked up shortly after I noticed problems with my sight. 

'I had started seeing straight lines as wavy ones. 

'For instance, lampposts, road markings and window frames would all look like they had kinks,’ says Bill, who lives in Winchester, Hampshire, with his wife Joy, also 71.

Treatments for the condition — Lucentis, Avastin and a newer drug called Eylea — are injected directly into the eye. 

They help stop the growth of blood vessels in the eye, as well as preventing them from leaking, which helps to preserve and improve vision.

Since his diagnosis, Bill has had upwards of 24 injections of all three medications. 

‘The sight in my right eye has been restored to almost normal — I can still drive, play bridge and read,’ he says. 

‘The injections saved me from going blind.’

Yet despite Lucentis and Avastin being equally effective and safe, Avastin is not widely available to patients.

This is because it was originally devised as a cancer treatment, and so is not officially permitted to be used for AMD (although it can be prescribed on a case-by-case basis, if the doctor accepts personal responsibility).

Independent trials, the latest of which was published in the influential Cochrane Reviews, have deemed the treatment safe for AMD.

‘The sight in my right eye has been restored to almost normal,' said Bill

Yet the Government watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), has not approved the drug for use in AMD patients — because it has not been officially licensed for this use — instead recommending that doctors use Lucentis or Eylea.

Campaigners warn this is leaving patients without a treatment option, as the drug can be used in patients for whom Lucentis and Eylea don’t work.

Furthermore, not being allowed to use Avastin means that the already cash-strapped NHS is having to spend a fortune on the other drugs needlessly.

Lucentis costs around £700 per injection, while Avastin is nearly eight times cheaper, at £90 per injection (Eylea is the most expensive at around £900 per injection). 

Each patient usually needs around 12 jabs in a lifetime.

Experts believe using Avastin, which is just as effective, could free up funds for treatment for other patients.

Professor Andrew Lotery, consultant ophthalmologist at Southampton General Hospital, says most macular patients are still given the more expensive Lucentis — which is costing the NHS an extra £102 million a year.

‘This could be better spent on delivering other treatments for patients,’ he says.

‘At the moment, eye departments are so overstretched that they are struggling to see AMD patients in time for them to have their first injections, which should be given within two weeks.

‘Patients are going blind waiting to be treated in some cases.’

However, Professor Lotery, who co-authored a piece in last week’s British Medical Journal with the president of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists, which called for Avastin to be made available on the NHS, says the issue is complex and steeped in red tape.

Although Avastin is licensed for bowel, breast, kidney and lung cancers, it isn’t licensed for AMD.

Doctors only began using Avastin for AMD when they noticed that patients who were being treated for cancer reported their macular degeneration improved.

It is up to the pharmaceutical company that manufactures Avastin — Roche — to apply for a licence for AMD, but this would require further clinical trials.

Critics say that the firm has little commercial incentive to do this as, globally, it also manufactures the more expensive Lucentis (though it is marketed by company Novartis within the EU).

Indeed Roche and Novartis were jointly fined €182.5 million by the Italian Anti-Trust Authority for ‘cartelising the sales of two major ophthalmic drugs’ — although both of the companies have denied this and an appeal is pending.

The authority said that the two companies ‘colluded to exclude the cheap drug Avastin to channel demand towards the most expensive drug, Lucentis’.

Until Avastin is licensed, NICE cannot approve its use. When a drug is not officially licensed for a condition, doctors need to prescribe the treatment ‘off-label’. 

However, Professor Lotery says the General Medical Council (GMC) states doctors should not use an unlicensed treatment where a licensed one exists.

‘Doctors risk personal liability and, technically, could even be struck off, or sued by a patient, if they use it,’ he warns.

‘We want the Department of Health to apply for a licence for Avastin.

‘There isn’t a precedent for this, but we would argue this is an exceptional case and the evidence is there to support this drug’s safety and effectiveness. NICE could then consider if this should be a recommended treatment.

‘Failing that, the GMC should indicate doctors will not face misconduct charges if they prescribe Avastin. We need some leadership from the Department of Health and GMC on this.’

The Macular Society charity is also calling for NICE to assess whether Avastin can be used for AMD. And John Harris, professor of bioethics at the University of Manchester, says it is ‘arguably immoral and unethical not to use Avastin’. 

‘There seems to be no reason at all why the NHS should not use Avastin in preference to Lucentis,’ he says.

A Roche spokeswoman confirmed the company has no plans to apply for a licence for Avastin to treat macular conditions or other eye conditions.

A Novartis spokeswoman said: ‘As it is not a Novartis medicine, we are not in a position to comment on it.’

While the bureaucratic battles rage on, patients who suffer from other rarer eye conditions that also affect central vision, such as Vicky Smith, 30, are facing a fight to get any treatment with Avastin on the NHS at all.

Vicky — who lives in Bungay, Suffolk, with her partner, Steve, 33, and their son, Tristan, 22 months — suffers from punctate inner choroidopathy (PIC), a rare eye condition, which can also cause loss of central vision and blind spots.

‘I first noticed I had a problem with my sight when I closed one of my eyes when applying eyeliner,’ says Vicky. 

‘I realised that there was a big dot blocking the centre of my vision in my right eye.’

Doctors told Vicky she needed injections into her eye straight away — or would go blind within six months. 

‘To make matters worse, I was told that Avastin, the treatment that could help, was not available on the NHS, as the drug wasn’t licensed to treat this condition,’ she says.

Even if she could find a doctor who would prescribe the treatment off-label, Vicky says ‘the cost of having each injection privately would be £600 to £1,000’.

‘I didn’t have the money. The local NHS Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) turned down my application for funding, saying it wasn’t a licensed treatment.’

After Vicky’s local paper ran a story about her plight, the local CCG agreed to pay for the first injection.

‘I’ve since needed four more injections,’ she says.

‘But, each time, I’ve had to apply to the CCG again — it’s maddening. Avastin needs to be licensed for eye conditions.’

Bill Organ echoes her frustration. 

‘The money saved could be invested into finding new treatments for other eye conditions,’ he says. 

‘We need to use some common sense here.’
