Rich claret and bronze tones, black bevelled glass and gold objets d’art create an opulent feel inside one of London's grandest homes.

The five-bedroom house in the capital's upmarket area of St John's Wood - now on the market for £30million - is the latest project by top interior designer Celia Sawyer.

But according to the designer, the same principles she applied to the uber-luxe mansion can be used in a property a fraction of the size.

Celia's latest project, 42 Avenue Road, is a magnificent, refurbished, detached residence in the exclusive 
St John's Wood area of London

Celia's project in St John's Wood: According to Celia, mirrors can be cleverly positioned to maximise light and give the feeling of space

She said: 'Whatever the size of the property or your budget you can create a stylish interior by using clever tricks.'

However, she admitted there are  some advantages of having a mansion to play with, like this one on Avenue Road.

'It is enjoyable creating interiors when you have large spaces, which allow you to be creative and define areas.'

'But if you have smaller space you can get creative with glass, mirror and lighting.'

Here, Celia reveals her ten simple design rules to transform any property into a style haven, whatever the size or budget.

Celia Sawyer reveals her 10 simple design rules to transform any property

Rule 1: Mirror mirror on the wall 

According to Celia, mirrors can be cleverly positioned to maximise light and give the feeling of space. 

'I will always use mirrors in rooms to enhance the sense of space and depth,' she said.

Rule 2: Keep the floor constant

'Linking flooring throughout enhances the sense of space.'

Keep the hallway  living room, dining room and kitchen the same, she advised.

'This will create a larger open-plan space and help your furniture and style flow.'

Rule 3: Create a colour punch

Celia advises keeping the colour scheme neutral but adding an accent shade to stay on trend.

'By keeping colour in your accent colours it means they are also easy to change, giving you more flexibly in the future,' she explained.

Rule 4: Find your star pieces

'One of my greatest tips is to always add a star piece into a room,' said Celia. 

The designer suggests a fantastic light, or an amazing centrepiece that captures attention on entering the room.

Rule 5: Play with textures

Celia advises layering and using different textures to add luxury and glamour.

'Mix plenty of textures with chrome, metallics and leather to really bring out the beauty of the contrasts.'

Rule 6: Plan ahead

According to Celia, mood boards are essential so that you plan your room out correctly. 

'You can choose the colours, layouts and style your rooms in advance to achieve your vision,' she said.

Rule 7: Go large for impact

'Large pieces of furniture in smaller rooms  give the impression of a larger room when executed properly.'

So don’t hold back on using large sofas and armchairs to create impact.

Rule 8: Set the mood

Think about the mood of the room and create a lighting scheme that fits. You don't need fancy LEDs or  systems, lamps can be just as effective.

'Mood lighting is essential to create a desired vibe in the room. From up-lighters to smart, changeable LEDs that give a warm glow, lighting is a powerful tool that must be used wisely,' said Celia.

The bath creates a focal point in the bathroom:  'One of my greatest tips is to always add a star piece into a room,' says Celia

'By keeping colour in your accent colours it means they are also easy to change, giving you more flexibly in the future,' Celia explains

Rule 9: Walls

Are your walls a blank canvas for displaying art, or are they to be treated as features in themselves?

'These are important question to ask yourself,' advised Celia.

'In some projects I mirror the entire wall to create a feature piece. It’s important not to mix up the two up!'

Rule 10: Don't forget comfort

There's no point making your house a masterpiece if it's not enjoyable to live in.

One comfort Celia never goes without is carpet in the bedroom.

'There is nothing nicer than stepping out of bed on to a luxurious carpet for that feeling of comfort and luxury each morning,' she said.

Celia advises keeping the flooring in the hallway living room, dining room and kitchen the same, as in her latest project

Go large for impact, says Celia, who used these over-sized pots in her St John's Wood project
