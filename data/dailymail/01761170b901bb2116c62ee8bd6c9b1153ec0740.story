A children's fashion show with guns in Moscow reportedly designed by a ten-year-old girl gives an illuminating glimpse into the way the Ukrainian crisis is seen by many Russians.

But critics of the Kremlin are viewing it as evidence of the pernicious power of propaganda in the worsening conflict, and it has been strongly criticised in Ukraine.

At the show held in a leading Moscow fashion venue, girl models believed to be aged between ten and 12 are dressed in the colours of major world countries.

Young girl representing Ukraine points a gun at her own head as she prepares to commit suicide in what has been described as a 'sick' propaganda stunt

Young model is then saved by other nations including Russia (left) and the USA (right) during performance said to be about 'world peace'

The girl in Ukraine's blue and yellow colours holds up a gun and points the weapon at the participants representing Russia and the US.

The image seems to suggest the Russian view that Ukraine - whose leaders are often branded fascists by the Moscow media and political leaders - are the aggressors in a conflict that has led to the worst crisis in the region since the demise of the Soviet Union.

In a shocking sequence, the schoolgirl representing Ukraine then points the gun at her own head.

The models from Russia and other countries including Britain - who also hold guns and parade up one by one to point them at the audience - are then seen 'saving' Ukraine from killing herself echoing the common view in Moscow that the country is slaughtering its own people.

In contrast, the West mainly believes the bloodshed is fuelled by Russia supplying fighters and weapons to separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine.

Child designer Alita Andrishevskaya, aged ten, who was also the model representing Russia in the show, is quoted saying the theme of her pageant was 'children of the world against the war'.

'It was inspired by the events in Ukraine,' said the presenter at the event, part of accessories exhibition Chapeau 2014.

Girl models parade in the colours of nine countries - Russia, the USA, Ukraine, Britain, Germany, 

China, Italy, France, and Greece - with specially designed exotic hats for each nation.

'The meaning of this collection is that all the children in this world are united, they are friends,' added the presenter.

'The author wanted to draw the attention to the idea of the peace in the whole world.'

Alita - a former Mini Miss Moscow - posted a picture online of herself representing Russia along with the models from the USA and Ukraine, all holding hands, and captioned: 'This is how it should be'.

Another young model dressed as the UK also appeared with a gun in the strangely themed show

Show designer Alita Andrishevskaya, aged ten, who was also the model representing Russia (above), said the theme of her pageant was 'children of the world against the war 

This sentiment will be shared by many, but the ideas behind the show was causing anger today.

The professionally-choreographed performance at leading Moscow fashion house Slava Zaitsev has come in for harsh criticism in Ukraine since being released on social media sites.

Some alleged that children in the show were pawns in a political battle between Moscow and Kiev, claiming children have been taught 'garbage'.

Evan Gel45 stated: 'Delirium ... Surrealism. Parallel world ...'

Chanita Seledtsovachas: 'Idiocy. To give guns to kids! They (have) gone crazy with their propaganda. I cannot believe. Madhouse cannot compare with this.'

lolbugaga wrote' 'Russia has pulled children into its dirty political plays! Russia, you are sick'.

'You go astray, grown ups. Leave the kids alone,' said one comment on the video of the performance which was posted online.

Viktor Troynov wrote: 'They are crazy. By the way, the law in Russia forbids propaganda of suicide among minors.'

Andrei Strukov: 'Russia degraded totally. Disintegration awaits this country.'

Gordon Black wrote: 'Sick people ... In Moscow was held a children's fashion show, where 'Ukraine is trying to commit suicide'.'

A comment from Maria Vityaz read: 'Games that children play .... They grow very quickly - now they're targeting the audience and themselves with toy guns ... and tomorrow - you will forget, while they won't.'
