Neymar has been keeping a holiday romance alive by flying model Soraja Vucelic to Barcelona in a private jet, according to reports in Serbia.

Belgrade-based tabloid Kurir claim the pair met last summer in Ibiza and have been speaking frequently via Skype. 

The paper say the couple agreed Vucelic would visit Barcelona at the end of October but then decided they couldn't wait that long.

Neymar then cancelled Vucelic's original tickets and sent a private plane to collect her and friend instead. The Serbian beauty reportedly stayed in Barcelona for several days.   

The model, who became popular in the Balkans after participating in their Big Brother show, also uploaded a picture of herself wearing Neymar's Barca shirt in an aeroplane - though there's nothing in the pictures to suggest the jet belongs to or was sent by the Brazilian.

Neymar was not in Barcelona's squad for Wednesday's penalty shoot-out win against Espanyol in the Catalan Super Cup, but will return  on Saturday for the visit of Celta Vigo.
