Former Italy manager Arrigo Sacchi has caused a racism storm by claiming there are 'too many black players' in the country.

'I'm certainly not racist and my history as a coach proves that, starting from [Frank] Rijkaard,' Sacchi is quoted as saying in Tuttosport. 

'But looking at the Viareggio tournament [a global youth tournament held annually in Tuscany] I feel like saying that there are too many black players, even in the youth teams.

'Italy has no dignity, no pride. It's not possible that our teams should have 15 foreign players in the squad.'

Sacchi later tried to clarify his remarks, saying: 'I've been misinterpreted, you think I'm really racist?

'All I said was I saw a game featuring a team who fielded four coloured players.

'My history speaks for itself, I've always coached teams with great players from every colour and I've brought in a lot, whether to Milan or Madrid.

'I only wanted to underline that we are losing our national pride and identity.' 

Sacchi was a hugely successful coach with AC Milan, winning the European Cup twice

1985-1987 Parma

(Serie C1 title 1986)

1987-1991 Milan

(Serie A 1987-88; European Cup 1989, 1990; European Super Cup 1989, 1990; Intercontinental Cup 1989, 1990)

1991-1996 Italy

(World Cup runners-up 1994)

1996-1997 Milan

1998-1999 Atletico Madrid

2001 Parma

2004-2005 Real Madrid (Director of Football)

Former AC Milan boss Sacchi, 68, is widely credited with bringing 'Total Football' to Serie A, and made the comments at a ceremony for the Maestrelli prizes in Pistoia.

Sacchi's last role in the game came as director of football at Real Madrid 10 years ago. 

Sacchi had two spells with Milan, and was praised for his contribution during his first stint in charge between 1987 and 1991.

The Italian won seven trophies at the San Siro, including two European Cups and a Serie A title.

He later coached the Italy national team between 1991 and 1996, leading them to the final of the World Cup in 1994, before taking charge of Atletico Madrid and Parma later in his career.

Mario Balotelli, Kevin-Prince Boateng and Kevin Constant are just some of the players who have been subject to racist abuse from fans over the years in Serie A.
