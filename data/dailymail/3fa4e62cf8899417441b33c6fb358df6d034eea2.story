Two brothers who survived the Boxing Day Tsunami and founded their own flip flop company from their London bedroom to support orphans in Sri Lanka are a step closer to achieving their dream.

Rob and Paul Forkan have landed their biggest deal to date after Accessorize have agreed to sell their Gandys flip flops designs in their stores across the UK from next Spring.

It is also a historic moment for the High Street brand. Peter Simon, the founder of Monsoon and Accessorize, who was born in Sri Lanka, explains: 'In its 30 year history, this is a first brand collaboration for Accessorize but it just feels right to support these young entrepreneurs.

The founders of Gandys Flip Flops, Rob and Paul Forkan and Monsoon Accessorize founder Peter Simon (L) visited an orphanage in Sri Lanka thsi week to celebrating a collboration between the two companies

'The Forkan brothers are truly inspirational and creating a company embodying such ethical principles fits with our own brand values.

'Supporting disadvantaged women and children in Asia and beyond is part of the Monsoon Accessorize own ethical stance in "giving something" back.'

Proceeds from sales of
 the flips flops have currently been going to the brothers 'Orphans for Orphans' initiative. Their 
goal is to raise enough money to open their first children's home by the end of next year in Goa.

So far their enterprise has also funded a teacher and a nurse in India for a year and bought school supplies for over 100 children in Asia.

Now Peter has also introduced Rob and Paul to two
 additional charities to work with and help fund on-going projects - The 
SOS Childrenâ€™s Village in Philiyandala and Pahamune House, Narammala, 
Kurunegala District in the North Western Province. Both charities 
support children who lost their parents in the tsunami.

When
 Gandys for Accessorize flip flops will be sold throughout the UK, a 
percentage of profits will go directly to the Sri Lankan charities.

Rob and Paul, 24, started their business from nothing after surviving the Boxing Day Tsunami

The brothers travelled with Peter to visit to the charities this month and said it was an 'emotional experience' returning to the country were they became orphans themselves.  

The Prime Minister David Cameron has 
also given them his full backing and met the brothers during their visit
 to Sri Lanka as he was also in the country for the Commonwealth leaders
 summit.

Rob, the elder of the brothers at 26 years, from Southfields, London,
 said: 'We are thrilled to be entering a partnership with Monsoon and 
Accessorize. When Peter approached us we jumped at the chance because we
 felt that we share the same ethical values and we have always been 
inspired by Peter, as he is a great businessman.'

As previously reported in MailOnline,
 Rob and Paul, 24, started their business from nothing after surviving 
the Boxing Day Tsunami.

They were travelling with their parents, Kevin and Sandra, and other siblings when they were caught up in the natural disaster while they were staying in Sri Lanka in 2004.

Rob and Paul, then aged 17 and 15 respectively, survived by clinging on to the roof of a building when the giant wave hit the coastline.

It is a historic moment for the High Street brand and Peter Simon, who was born in Sri Lanka, explains: 'In its 30 year history, this is a first brand collaboration for Accessorize but it just feels right to support these young entrepreneurs.'

Their
 parents had managed to get their younger brother, Mattie, then aged 12,
 and sister, Rosie, eight, to safety before being swept away.

The orphans were left with nothing and had to hitchhike across the devastated country to make it back to Britain where they would be cared for by their extended family and friends.

But rather than being broken by the tragedy, the brothers decided to do something positive to honour the memory of their mother and father and help other orphaned children around the world.

Taking inspiration from their philanthropist parents, who had given up their jobs in the fashion industry to volunteer for humanitarian projects, the pair designed flip flops made from natural materials with a woven rope style.

Starting out from their bedroom in 
Brixton, the flip flop design evolved to be made from rubber while still
 incorporating the distinctive pleated toe bar. They have men and 
women's styles with vibrant colours and patterns.
