Vandalising cars, attacking the elderly and head-butting windows, Phil has become notorious in his home village.

The yob in question? Not a feral teen but a very territorial pheasant.

Residents of Wentnor in Shropshire  spoke of their despair yesterday at the bird’s behaviour, with some saying they can’t leave their home for fear of being pecked and chased.

The 2ft tall pheasant, nicknamed Phil, lurks by the home of Sally-Ann Hudson, 44, and her parents Ann, 77, and Ben, 79.

He waits throughout the day and night 
and swoops when the family dares to emerge.

When they are inside, he 
head-butts the windows and has even tried to break into the front door.

The attacks have got so bad Miss Hudson is scared of leaving home 
without gloves and a badminton racquet to fend him off.

Sally-Ann said she has tried to befriend the bird by feeding him crumbs of corn bread but the attacks have continued regardless

She claims to have been stalked for 
the past four months, with the bird specifically targeting her family.

Experts said this is probably because Phil has become confused, seeing 
her as a rival male pheasant.

Miss Hudson, a medical secretary, 
said: ‘Sometimes I go from one room into another, and he will run round 
the outside of the house following my movements.

'He even tries to get 
into the house – it’s like something from a Hitchcock film.

‘Often when we get in the car, he will
appear from nowhere and either jump on the car or start pecking it.

'He 
runs alongside as we drive away, pecking and head-butting the wheels.’

The family has resorted to leaving out food for Phil in the hope he might stop seeing them as enemies.

‘A couple of times in the last two 
weeks I have tried to befriend him, feeding him crumbs of corn bread, 
which he loves,’ Miss Hudson added. ‘

But he has no gratitude and is 
always ready to attack. Pheasants are normally just rather dopey birds –
but this one is a nutter.’

Paul North, from the World Pheasant 
Association, said the bird was displaying typical mating season 
behaviour. ‘He obviously sees her as a rival male,’ he added.
