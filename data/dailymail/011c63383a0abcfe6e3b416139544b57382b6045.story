Judge Judy may be TV’s top earner but she wasn’t too grand to officiate at her grandson’s wedding over the weekend.

The 70-year-old TV judge, real name Judy Sheindlin, together with her judge husband Jerry Sheindlin took charge as grandson Casey Barber wed his bride Olivia in a lavish ceremony on her estate in Greenwich, Connecticut on Saturday afternoon.

More than 150 guests were served lobster and steak as Casey, a history/political science major and CEO of his own social media firm, and his bride, who is originally from Naples, Florida, celebrated their nuptials.

It was reported last month that Judy Judy is the top earner in any television genre with annual earnings of $47 million in the daytime/syndication category

The wedding took place at the Sheindlin’s 12.5 acre estate which has a stunning multilevel stone patio area where the ceremony took place.

The 16,993 square foot home was built in 2008, after the Sheindlins had purchased the estate the previous year for $13.2 million and had the original home demolished.

No word yet on where the happy couple are honeymooning, but grandma Judy also owns a $16 million dollar yacht called ‘Triumphant Lady.’

The magnificent yacht is 152 feet long and has five cabins for 14 guests. It is harbored in Naples, Florida, where the Sheindlins also own a $6.9 million penthouse.

Last month it was reported that the 
TV judge is the top earner in any television genre with annual earnings 
of $47 million in the daytime/syndication category.

Her
no-nonsense approach has proved an enduring hit and she holds the 
number one spot in daytime TV. Her show has been on air for 14 years and
will run at least through 2015.

In
June the show won its first Daytime Emmy for Outstanding 
Legal/Courtroom Program on its 15th nomination. It is the first 
long-running, highly-rated court show to win an Emmy. Season 18 premiered today on Monday, September 9.

The
Sheindlins, both divorces, married in 1977. They divorced in 1990, 
partially as a result of the stress and struggles that Judith incurred 
after her father's death that same year, but remarried the following 
year. They have five children – Gregory, Jamie, Adam, Jonothan (sic) and 
Nicole – and 12 grandchildren.
