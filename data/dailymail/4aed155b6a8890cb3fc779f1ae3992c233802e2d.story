The doctor notified the state Department of Children and Families, but the child was initially reluctant to tell authorities what happened.

The next day the girl went to visit relatives in Queens, New York, and confided in one that Rodriguez had sexually abused her on several occasions and that it was he who impregnated her.

The relative then alerted police, who took Rodriguez into custody, reports The Currant.

He was held on an investigative detention for 48 hours while the Stamford Police Department investigated the accusations.

Rodriguez was held on $100,000 bail and arraigned Monday in Superior Court in Stamford, before being sent to Bridgeport Correctional

Stamford police interviewed the girl, her mother and the relative before applying for an arrest warrant for Rodriguez on July 19.

He was held on $100,000 bail and arraigned on Monday in Superior Court in Stamford, before being sent to Bridgeport Correctional.
