The wife of a missing Royal Navy sailor who disappeared five months ago today wept as she issued a fresh plea for help in finding her husband who she described as her 'soul mate'.

Rachael MacColl, 25, said she has not given up hope since husband Timmy MacColl, 28, vanished while on shore leave in Dubai on May 27.

But she revealed their seven-year-old son Cameron now believes 'Daddy is in heaven'.

given up hope since husband Timmy MacColl, 28, vanished while on shore 
leave in Dubai on May 27 and believes he's still alive

Agony: Rachael MacColl, 25, wipes away tears as she talks to the press today.  Her husband is said to have got into a taxi back to port at around 2am after a 
night out in Dubai in May and hasn't been seen since

Appeals to trace the Leading Seaman - 
who is said to have got into a taxi back to port at around 2am after a 
night out - have drawn blanks.

But
Mrs MacColl - who gave birth to the couple's third child, daughter 
Eriskay, last month - still believes her husband of six years may be 
alive.

Mrs MacColl, whose 
family is originally from Killin, Stirling, described the effect 
his disappearance has had on Eriskay, Cameron, and daughter Skye, four.

Missing: Timothy MacColl, 27, from Gosport in Hampshire, with one of his two children. He vanished in May

Surrounded by family and friends at 
Timmy's home port of Portsmouth, Hampshire, she said: 'My daughter thinks 
her daddy is still going to come home.

'Only this weekend, she asked: 'Do they look for daddy in the dark?'

'She also said: 'I hope he comes home soon.'

'My son is a little bit older and he believes his daddy is in heaven and is never going to come back.

'He says he is the man of the house now. He has taken charge of the TV remote and has taken his dad's seat.

'Eriskay is not going to have the chance to know her dad unless our appeal to find him is successful.

'I do believe sometimes that Timmy is sitting in a police cell, having been mistaken for somebody else.'

Mrs
MacColl last spoke to her husband, who she described as her 'soul mate,
first love and best friend', two days before he disappeared.

He was excited about her pregnancy 
because she had given him her 20 week scan pictures of Eriskay as a six 
year wedding anniversary present.

The Scottish sailor had proudly shown the scan to crewmates.

Mrs
MacColl, who was with newborn Eriskay today, continued: 'The thing that
pains me the most is that Timmy is not there for the children.

'Growing
up without a father himself, meant Timmy put everything into being a 
great daddy and he would be heartbroken that he has not been here with 
them over the last few months.

'Since
the day we met, Timmy has been a proud serving member of the armed 
forces and we have both embraced all that military life has to offer and
enjoyed every moment of it.

'We, like many others, have had to endure months of separation with back to back deployments.

'This has been the longest deployment but unlike others there is no rainbow and homecoming at the end.'

Mrs MacColl said she collapsed when navy officers called to deliver the news that Timmy was missing.

She added: 'My head could not understand what they meant.

'For the last five months, I have sat at home unable to give up hope, unable to move forwards, unable to grieve.'

Timmy's
shipmates say they put him in a taxi outside a night club in the early 
hours of Sunday, May 27, to return to their ship HMS Westminster.

He
did not arrive back on board at its berth in Port Rashid and has not 
been seen since or made contact with his family or the Royal Navy.

A taxi driver questioned by police recalls dropping a sailor back at port that night.

Searches,
including a sweep of the coastline by a Royal Navy minesweeper equipped
with sophisticated cameras and sensors, failed to find Timmy at sea.

Mrs MacColl today criticised Dubai 
police, who are leading the investigation, and spoke of her frustration 
at how the case has been handled.

Dubai police have not taken up an offer to interview members of the ship's company either in the UK or via videolink.

And Timmy's family believe valuable time was wasted in the first few hours after he went missing.

Mrs
MacColl asked why HMS Westminster, which had two key witnesses onboard,
was allowed to set sail within days of Timmy's disappearance.

And she tearfully said she had run up £300 phone bills in her quest for answers.

Mrs
MacColl, who flew out to Dubai when Timmy disappeared, said police 
there suggested seven scenarios that may have happened to her husband.

Mixed emotions: Friends and relatives of Timmy lined the shoreline to 
release yellow balloons and unfurled a banner as the ship returned to its 
home port of Portsmouth, Hampshire in August - without him

These included falling into the sea or running off with another woman, both of which she dismissed.

Comrades on the ship left a space for their missing colleague when they returned to the UK in August.

And all efforts by police in Dubai to trace him have thrown up no clues.

The couple, from Gosport, Hampshire, met while Rachael was working at a naval base.

She
last saw Timmy in March when he managed a brief visit after giving 
evidence in Somalia against pirates caught by his previous ship.

Missing: Timmy, right, has not been seen since getting into a taxi at around 2am on May 27. It is known that he had just left the Rock Bottom Bar, left, which is at the Regent Hotel in the area of Deira, Dubai

After around ten days he was deployed to HMS Westminster.

The MacColl's constituency MP, Conservative Caroline Dinenage was also at today's appeal.

She said she continued to support efforts to find the missing sailor and had raised the issue in the House of Commons.

A
spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: 'We have been 
working closely on the very sad case of leading seaman MacColl. We continue to provide assistance to his family at this very difficult and very sad time.'
