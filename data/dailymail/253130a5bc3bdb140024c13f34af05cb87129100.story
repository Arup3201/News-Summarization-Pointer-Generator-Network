With his grey hair, smart dress and spectacles, he’s certainly not your archetypal mugger.

CCTV captures the elderly man bending down as if to help toddler Luella Hinnigan in her buggy.

But in reality, he was stealing an iPhone the youngster was using to watch an episode of Barney the Dinosaur.

Shocking act: The thief snatches the phone from the 20-month-old's hands as she watches a Barney the Dinosaur film

Luella, who is 20 months old, had been briefly given the mobile to 
keep her occupied in a clothes shop in Ormskirk, Lancashire, while her 
mother browsed.

As she watched a cartoon of Barney on the device, the thief quietly 
approached, pulled the £400 Apple iPhone 4 from her hands and hurried 
away.

Her mother, Danielle Hinnigan, 26, who had turned her back briefly, 
realised the phone had vanished only when she heard Luella say: ‘Mummy, 
Barney gone, gone.’

At first she thought her daughter had dropped the phone, but after asking shop staff at Hype to check CCTV she realised what had happened and staff called the police.

Today, as officers issued an appeal for help to find the callous culprit, Ms Hinnigan, of Kirkby, Liverpool, said: ‘I’m feeling sick and disgusted at what this man did. How anyone can mug a child like that is beyond me.

‘Luella loves Barney and was watching a show on my phone.

'I thought maybe she had dropped it, I never thought someone would go in her pram and take it off her.

‘I’m just glad it was just the phone and Luella was OK. '

'He’s followed me into that shop, to think he has targeted my daughter is disgusting.

'Everyone is absolutely disgusted, her dad was really angry and upset.

'It made me sick to think an old man could do something like that.'

The incident occurred on September 22 as Danielle was on a shopping trip with Luella and her family.

Lancashire Police believe the thief, who may have been with a female accomplice, followed them in after spotting the toddler holding the phone outside.

The man is seen standing in front of the pram looking into it.

He then looks around the shop before leaning forward, prising the phone from Luella’s hands and then turns and walks away while stuffing it into his pocket.

Police are now appealing for anyone who recognises the man to get in touch.

He was wearing glasses, had longish straight greying dark hair and was wearing a light jacket with dark inner hood and light coloured trousers.

Insp Andy Willis, of Lancashire Police, said: ‘This is a despicable offence where it appears that the suspect has deliberately targeted a child knowing the crime would be relatively easy to commit.’
