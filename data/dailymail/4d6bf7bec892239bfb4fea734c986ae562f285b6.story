Error messages that pop up on Windows computers could enable the National Security Agency to spy on PC users, according to a report.

The error messages appear when a Windows programme stops working or 'freezes' and a computer user can choose to send an error report to Microsoft to highlight the problem, which is designed to help Microsoft engineers improve their products and fix bugs.

However, conscientious computer users might be sending reports to the NSA as well as the tech giant, a report by German magazine Der Spiegel suggests.

News that the reports are being sent to the controversial organisation’s top hacking unit, the Tailored Access Operations (TAO) division, come from the latest leaked documents from Edward Snowden, The Huffington Post reported.

The crash reports are a ‘neat way’ of gaining ‘passive access' to a computer, according to an NSA presentation obtained by Der Spiegel.

Conscientious computer users might be sending reports to the NSA as well as Microsoft after a programme has crashed, a report suggests

Official hackers can reportedly pick out interesting error message reports using powerful software, which could tell the NSA about the vulnerabilities of a certain computer.

Computer security expert, Graham Clueley, told MailOnline that any possible snooping is not limited to U.S. citizens and could affect Britons, as the NSA is largely interested in spying on people outside the country.

'It's yet another method that could find weaknesses in a computer, which they could exploit,' he said.

While there is no evidence to suggest that British intelligence agencies are using the same technique, Mr Clueley said it 'would not be a massive shock' if it was later discovered that they were, as the NSA and GCHQ have used a variety of similar methods to snoop on people in the past.

A graphic within the presentation hints that NSA agents made fun of how easy the error message trick made their jobs.

Designed to look just like a genuine Microsoft error report popup, it says: ‘A log of this error has been created. Please tell Microsoft about this problem. This information may be intercepted by a foreign SIGINT system to gather detailed information and better exploit your machine.’

Microsoft has been in the spotlight since July when Mr Snowden began his leaks, including that the tech giant might have given the NSA access to customers’ encrypted messages as well as data.

The company has recently tried to allay customer fears by obstructing U.S. agencies’ bids to access Microsoft’s foreign customers’ data.

A Microsoft spokesman told The Huffington Post: ‘Microsoft does not provide any government with direct or unfettered access to our customer's data.

‘We would have significant concerns if the allegations about government actions are true.'

Former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who revealed details of electronic surveillance by American and British spy services, warned of the dangers posed by a loss of privacy in a Channel 4's 'Alternative Christmas Message'.

In a two-minute video recorded in Moscow, where Snowden has been granted temporary asylum, he spoke of concerns over surveillance in an age of huge technological advancement.

'We have sensors in our pockets that track us everywhere we go. Think about what this means for the privacy of the average person,' he said.

'A child born today will grow up with no conception of privacy at all,' said Snowden.

'They'll never know what it means to have a private moment to themselves, an unrecorded, unanalysed thought. And that's a problem because privacy matters, privacy is what allows us to determine who we are and who we want to be.'

The 'Alternative Christmas Message', broadcast annually on Channel 4 television since 1993, mimics the format of the yearly address to the nation by Queen Elizabeth.

On Tuesday, Snowden - who disclosed thousands of confidential documents - said in an interview published in the Washington Post that he had achieved what he set out to do.

'For me, in terms of personal satisfaction, the mission's already accomplished,' he said.

Last week a White House-appointed panel proposed curbs on some key NSA surveillance operations, recommending limits on a programme to collect records of billions of telephone calls, and new tests before Washington spies on foreign leaders.
