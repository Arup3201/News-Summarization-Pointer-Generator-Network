Unconventional,
futuristic-looking and durable, the Philips ShoqBox is determined to 
buck the trend when it comes to portable speakers.

A far cry from the rectangular slabs associated with the hardware, the 
ShoqBox's striking metal bands flank an aggressive-looking grill in the
middle.

Stylish: The ShoqBox's diamond design helps it stand out from the competition

On top, a small on/off button emits an attractive blue light 
when activated.

Charging is simple and is done through a micro-USB plug-in at the bottom of the speaker.

Cleverly,
the ShoqBox issues voice prompts to inform the user how much battery life is remaining and also when it has paired successfully.

Although the voice 
emitted sounds slightly muffled, music played through the ShoqBox is 
clear and crisp.

Versatile: The speaker can be used almost anywhere

The relatively 
small unit is capable of filling most rooms with impressive volume sound with 
minimal crackle. This is due to it housing four neodymium drivers.

Depth
of sound could be slightly better, but it is strong through the 
mid-range with adequate instrument distinction and pitch.

Connectable via Bluetooth, the speaker has a range of around 33ft and works with any IOS device.

It is even possible to pair two ShoqBoxes to tailor amplitude for larger rooms.

Philips
claim battery life will last around eight hours. However - under 
constant use, some may find this drains the power slightly more quickly.

Nevertheless, the ShoqBox is a bold, inventive and above all versatile portable speaker which is well worth your consideration.
