A woman who hit international headlines for allegedly being fired from Citibank because was 'too sexy' is now suing a medical lab for hurting her while drawing blood.

Debrahlee Lorenzana - who in 2010 publicly accused Citibank of sacking because her double D implants made her 'too attractive' and 'too distracting' to male co-workers - is now claiming to have suffered 'serious and severe permanent injuries' following a visit to Quest Diagnostics.

In papers filed in Queens Supreme Court that were obtained by New York Daily News, the 36-year-old said she went to a Quest lab in Bayside on July 3, 2012, and was treated by a nurse 'who lacked the requisite skills to draw blood without inflicting harm on her subjects'.

The suit claims the phlebotomist, identified as 'Jane Doe', and the lab 'failed to properly diagnose, treat (and) prescribe for the condition from which the plaintiff was suffering'.

Back in court: 'Too sexy for Citibank' banker Debrahlee Lorenzana has filed a new lawsuit, this time against a Quest Diagnostics clinic in Queens, claiming to have suffered 'serious and severe permanent injuries' while having blood drawn

Debrahlee Lorenzana shot to notoriety in 2010 for alleging her male bosses at Citibank New York found her work attire too steamy and fired her for it

The lawsuit brought forward by Debrahlee Lorenzana is said to have occurred here, at the the Quest Diagnostics lab in Bayside, Queens, New York

They also allegedly 'failed to properly advise and instruct the plaintiff concerning post-procedure care'.

Strangely, the suit does not explain Lorenzana's medical condition or clearly identify her injuries.

It does however say she experienced 'severe shock and damage to her nervous system and certain internal injuries'.

The visit also 'damaged her physcophysical motor skills'.

Psychophysics is defined as 'the branch of psychology that deals with the relationships between physical stimuli and sensory response'.

While Lorenzana declined to comment on the case, her lawyer, Frank Panetta, said the suit was not as strange as it sounds.

Debrahlee Lorenzana underwent xtensive plastic surgery to look like a 'cross between Pamela Anderson and Carmen Electra'

In vein: Personal banker Debrahlee Lorenzana has been vague about the injuries she sustained when filing her current lawsuit. Her lawyer said it related to 'nerve damage'

He claims the lab tech was struggling to draw blood from his client and 'she got nerve damage'

'What’s unusual about that?' Panetta said.

'Sometimes they screw up.'

The same lawsuit, filed in March, names a Queens driver who rear-ended her in a car accident in Long Island City in December 2012.

Panetta said both were named because his client developed more severe nerve damage after the car accident and 'we’re not 100% sure which incident caused the injury'.

Presumably Lorenzana is expecting a more successful outcome with her current complaint than with her infamous Citibank lawsuit.

In 2003, Lorenzana took part in a 2003 TV show called Plastic Surgery New York Style for the Discovery Health Channel.

In the show she was filmed giggling at a plastic surgeon's office as she discussed having a fourth boob job.

'That's what I want to be - tits on a stick,' she said on the show.

In 2003 Debrahlee Lorenzana appeared in a plastic surgery documentary and spoke about her want for bigger breasts

In 2010, she went up against the banking giant Citi claiming discrimination in the workplace.

Having undergone extensive plastic surgery to look like a 'cross between Pamela Anderson and Carmen Electra', Lorenzana said she was sexually harassed because of her figure.

She said she was ordered to stop wearing turtlenecks, pencil skirts, three-inch heels or fitted business suits.

A 33-year-old single mother at the time, Lorenzana said other female colleagues wore much more revealing outfits than she did.

'They said their body shapes were different from mine, and I drew too much attention,' she said at the time.

Despite the far-reacing publicity her lawsuit agianst Citibank garnered in 2010, Debrahlee Lorenzana received not a cent in damages, according to the banking giant

The case eventually went in to arbitration, but Citi have since confirmed they did not pay her a thing in damages.

Lorenzana later went to work for Chase at branches in Brooklyn and Queens.

Public records show she left Chase in the summer and has since relocated to Florida, where she’s working for Wells Fargo.

The new lawsuit seeks unspecified money damages.
