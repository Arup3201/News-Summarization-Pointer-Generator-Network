Friends and colleagues of the 23-year-old up-and-coming tennis player expressed their shock at news of her tragic death.

Degtiareva was  ranked 1,084 in the world with her highest ranking at 947, and her most notable career moment was reaching the quarter-finals of an ITF event in Turkey.

Blonde Violetta had started to attract similar fame, but has now suddenly died after apparently collapsing during a training session.

The blonde beauty, who was born in the city of Rostov in south-western Russia close to the border with Ukraine, reportedly suffered heart failure and it is not yet clear as to whether she died at her training centre or on the way to hospital.

News of her death was not immediately released and only became public when her close friend and fellow tennis player Anastasia Vdovenco, 20, posted it on Facebook, where it was picked up by Russian media.

Anastasia said: 'I can hardly believe it. Rest in peace.'
