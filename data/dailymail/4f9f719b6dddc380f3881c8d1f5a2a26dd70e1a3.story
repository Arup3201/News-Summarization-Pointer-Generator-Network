Whistleblower Chelsea Manning says the military is continuing to deny her sex change treatment one year after she was jailed for handing secret documents to WikiLeaks.

The former US army private, sentenced to 35-years under the name Bradley, revealed she is being forced to live as a man at Fort Leavenworth prison, Kansas.

Manning says the Defense Department has not followed through with its promises after defense secretary, Chuck Hagel, approved a treatment plan that includes allowing her to dress as a woman.

Chelsea Manning, formerly Bradley, says the military is continuing to deny her sex change treatment

She is now prepared to sue the military over the failure to carry out any recommendations, except 'lip service'.

'Unfortunately, despite silence, and then lip-service, the military has not yet provided me with any such treatment,' she wrote in a letter to broadcaster NBC said.

'For example, in my daily life, I am reminded of this when I look at the name on my badge, the first initial sewed into my clothing, the hair and grooming standards that I adhere to, and the titles and courtesies used by the staff.

'Ultimately, I just want to be able to live my life as the person that I am, and to be able to feel comfortable in my own skin.'

Manning was sentenced to 35-years in jail after being convicted of leaking nearly 700,000 documents to the site WikiLeaks. 

The documents revealed a 38-minute video of an American airstrike in Baghdad that killed two Reuters journalists and wounded children, as well as embarrassing diplomatic cables.

Shortly after the sentence was handed down, Manning went public with her gender dysphoria - the sense of being a woman in a man's body.

And the former intelligence analyst asked for a treatment plan that would consider three measures: dressing and living as a woman, hormone therapy and possible surgery.

Manning's lawyer, David Coombs, said that the military has failed to carry out the recommendations and that he is prepared to sue.

'The military's failure to comply with the treatment recommendations and protocols for Chelsea's diagnosed gender dysmorphia violates her well-established constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment,' he said.

The Army declined to say when treatment might begin.

The October 2010 release by Wikileaks of hundreds of thousands of battlefield reports, diplomatic cables and a video of a U.S. helicopter attack that killed civilians, was the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history.

Following the documents' publication Manning was arrested and the Wikileaks site closed down.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange recently announced that he will 'soon' leave Ecuador's embassy in London, where he has been holed up for two years to avoid extradition.

Police have been stationed at the compound since Mr Assange requested political asylum from Ecuador in June 2012, ready to arrest him if he sets foot outside.

In September last year, Manning requested a presidential pardon for handing U.S state secrets to the WikiLeaks website because it was done 'out of a love for my country'.
