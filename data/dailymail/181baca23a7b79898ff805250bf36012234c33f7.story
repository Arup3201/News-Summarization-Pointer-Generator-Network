Skeletal remains found in the Arizona desert could be those of a 19-year-old student who went missing in June, police said.

More than 100 officers combed the sparse desert in Apache Junction, near Tempe, where the body was discovered by a property owner on August 6.

Because the remains were so decomposed, authorities have only confirmed they believe it could be college student Adrienne Salinas today.

Miss Salinas went missing in the early hours of June 15 as she headed to her boyfriend's home after the couple rowed at a party.

She had called for a cab at about 4am but when the driver turned up, she was already gone, according to Fox 10.

When the body was found near Highway 88, detectives checked missing persons databases to see if there would be a match. Miss Salinas was the only listed in the area.

Similarities between Miss Salinas and the body were noted, although police did not highlight what they were. They are now waiting for DNA results to confirm if the remains are hers.

Her family were notified that a body had been found last week.

Miss Salinas' father, Rick Salinas, told 3TV he was heartbroken and 'too sick' for words. He declined to say anything more about the possibility that his daughter might be dead.

Questions: The body was found off Route 88 but police do not know if it was dumped there or had washed away

Tests: Authorities are awaiting the results of DNA to see if the remains belong to Adrienne

Mr Salinas had raised the alarm after dropping round to see his daughter on June 16 and finding her door unlocked.

He said he had been concerned when she failed to call him on Father's Day, according to HLN.

More than 100 officers from the FBI and Tempe Police used rakes to search the area around where the body was found at 5am to cover as much ground as possible before the 110F midday temperatures.

'The area where the remains were located has been searched several times since the recovery, but today investigators from multiple agencies will search an even larger area, much of it consisting of rough terrain,'Tempe police sergeant Mike Pooley told 3TV.

'We're looking for any kind of clues that might help us solve this case.'

Police have said they suspect foul play, but they do not know if the body was dumped in the desert or washed there in a recent flood.Â 

Concern: Adrienne with her father Rick, who reported her missing when she failed to call on Father's Day

Vigil: Family and friends have been trying to help find Adrienne

Miss Salinas was last seen by her housemates
in the early hours of June 15. They had held a party, at which the 
teenager and her boyfriend had argued.

She was seen leaving her apartment with a small bag after 3am and at 3.45am a witness reported seeing her car being driven erratically. It was later found abandoned, with two flat tires.

According to cell phone records, the 19-year-old called for a cab and made several missed calls to her boyfriend, Francisco Arteaga, at about 4am.

Her last message to him read: 'I'm coming overt [sic]'. It was sent at 4..43am shortly before her phone went dead.

Shortly after she went missing Mr Arteaga told CBS5: 'It's impossible not to think about her. There's never been a week where I haven't seen her. It's been three weeks now. It's scary.'

Her father added: 'It's impossible for her to have just vanished into thin air. Somebody knows something. And, we're just pleading with that person, that someone, to just come forward.'

Gone: The 19-year-old college student was last seen on June 15

Both the cab driver, who said Miss Salinas was gone before he arrived to pick her up at a garage, and her boyfriend have been cleared as suspects.

However, police said if the remains turn out to Miss Salinas they will go back and interview everyone again.

'Nothing is off the table as we speak right now,' Sergeant Pooley said.
