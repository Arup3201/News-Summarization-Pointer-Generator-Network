A Black Hawk helicopter crash that killed four U.S. servicemen on a British nature reserve occurred after a bird-strike knocked the pilots unconscious. 

Christopher S Stover, Sean M Ruane, Dale E Mathews and Afton M Ponce all died when a US Air Force helicopter came down in Cley-next-the-Sea, Norfolk during a training exercise on January 7.

An Accident Investigation Board report into the accident today found that a flock of geese, startled by the noise, had struck the helicopter, breaking through its windscreen and colliding with the pilots.

The helicopter's stabilisation systems were disabled by the bird strike, leaving the aircraft moving randomly through the air and causing it to crash three seconds later.

The crew were serving with 56th Rescue Squadron, 48th Fighter Wing, based at RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk, which carries out search and rescue operations.

At the time they were on a training mission to recreate a night-time rescue scenario involving a downed F-16 pilot.

As they flew over Cley Marshes the helicopter was engulfed by a flock of geese, which weighed up to 12lbs each, after the birds were 'likely startled by the noise of the approaching helicopters'.

Brigadier
 General Jon Norman, president of the inquiry’s board, said his 
investigation had 'found clear and convincing evidence' that 'multiple 
bird strikes caused the mishap'.

As well as the tragic loss of life, the crash cost the US government an estimated £23.5 million, the report said.

'At least three geese penetrated the windscreen, rendering the mishap pilot and mishap co-pilot unconscious, and at least one goose struck the mishap aerial gunner in the performance of special mission aviator duties, rendering the mishap aerial gunner unconscious,' it adds.

With the pilot and co-pilot unconscious and stabilisation systems disabled, the helicopter’s control stick would have moved randomly, the report adds.

The helicopter banked to the left and, unable to lift vertically, hit the ground within seconds.

The report states that the crew 'followed the available guidance on bird hazards in the UK' and complied with the UK Military Low Flying Handbook to the 'maximum extent'.

Recent bird activity maps had suggested low activity in the area but a storm surge the previous month had forced several flocks of birds to relocate from the nearby Blakeney Nature Reserve.

This relocation is likely to have resulted in a larger-than-normal presence of geese.

The MoD said it had received 11 complaints about low flying in 2013, none of which were made by people living in the Cley area. These related to the noise created by aircraft and not safety risks.

A 'seasonal avoidance' had been in place between April and September each year since 2012 following an application from the wildlife trust but this accident happened outside that period.

An MoD spokesman said it had no new comment in light of the report, but previously said: 'We understand that military low flying can be noisy and unpopular but it is an essential part of operational training.'

'The 20th century legacy of military airfields close to this location does make this a particularly busy area for aircraft and the MoD is constantly striving to ensure that such disturbance is kept to an absolute minimum and that the burden of noise pollution is as evenly distributed as possible throughout the UK Low Flying System as a whole.'

'In addition the MoD takes the protection of wildlife and habitats very seriously and liaises constantly with the joint nature conservation committee.'
