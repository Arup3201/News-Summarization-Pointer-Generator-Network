Brave: Joan Lunden told viewers on Good Morning America that she has been diagnosed with breast cancer

Support: GMA host Robin Roberts, herself a cancer survivor speaks to Joan Lunden on Tuesday morning's GMA show where the former host revealed her own cancer diagnosis

She said after the initial shock of the diagnosis, she resolved to learn everything she can about the illness and go into what she called 'warrior mode.'

The 63-year-old Lunden is now a health and wellness advocate. She has written eight books

Lunden's treatment for her cancer, which she has described as 'aggressive' will include lumpectomy surgery, chemotherapy and radiation.

She has said that she is expecting to make a full recovery from the tumor in her right breast which was discovered during her annual ultrasound.

'I sat there stunned – how could this be? I considered myself fit and healthy, I get checked faithfully every year and I didn’t have a history of breast cancer in my family,' Lunden wrote on her blog about diagnosis.

'But of course after covering many stories about breast cancer over the years, I knew that none of us are exempt.

'I also knew that I had to jump into action quickly, put together a team, and find the best course of treatment for the kind of cancer that I have.'

Revealing how she felt when she was told the news, Lunden said that telling her two sets of twins, aged 11 and nine was difficult.

Sitting down, Max and Kate, 11 and Jack and Kimberly, both nine, Lunden said that she was confident explaining her condition, because 'mommy is going to be ok'

'And that is really the bottom line,' she told Roberts live on air.

Both twins were born with the help of a surrogate mother and Lunden said that her three older girls from her previous marriage have been a great help too.

'When something like this happens you learn just how important family is,' said Lunden about the strength she draws from Jamie, 34, Lindsay, 31 and Sarah, 27.

The popular former anchor added that her husband, Jeff Konigsberg, whom she married in April, 2000, has been incredibly in his support.

Lunden, who co-hosted GMA from 1980 to 1997, said she initially considered keeping the news private, but decided to go public with her diagnosis.

'I have decided to talk about my breast cancer because since the moment I took the job at Good Morning America I have lived my life sharing my joys and my disappointments with all of you: my pregnancies, my relationships, my career… I have shared my journey,' Lunden wrote.

'So it certainly didn’t feel right keeping this part of my journey a secret.'

During the course of this morning's interview, Lunden revealed her reaction to the diagnosis.

'I heard those words that every woman dreads and fears and never wants to hear. You have breast cancer,' said Lunden, who admitted she has already started her chemotherapy.

'In the beginning you almost think, what did I do wrong? But then I just turned a corner and I said wait a second.

'I went into warrrior mode.'

Lunden, who has long been a campaigner for women's health issues said that it was her commitment to thorough testing that allowed her cancer to be caught.

'Nothing showed in my mammogram. Then you go all happy go lucky into the ultrasound and she kept going back to one spot and I knew they had found something,' said Lunden.

'My husband sat with me and I knew the minute she walked in the door, I could just tell by her demeanor.

'I have the more aggressive kind so its going to be the chemotherapy and the surgery and the radiation.'

Lunden said she is optimistic about her prognosis, and said women everywhere need to go through their annual checkups.

She added that her father, a prominent cancer surgeon who died in a plane crash when Lunden was young, would have wanted her to spread the word about cancer screenings.

'I consider myself fortunate that I found this in the early stages and the prognosis is so promising,' Lunden wrote.

'I know I have a challenge ahead of me in this journey, however I have chosen to take it as an opportunity to fulfill my father’s legacy and try to inspire others to protect their health. '.
