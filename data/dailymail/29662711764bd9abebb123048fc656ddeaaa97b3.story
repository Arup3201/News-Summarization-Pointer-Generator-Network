The striped 'Sheriff' shirt has been removed from sale by Zara, which apologised after customers said it looked like concentration camp uniforms

Clothing chain Zara was under fire today after it unveiled a new children’s T-shirt that bears a strong resemblance to concentration camp uniforms worn by Holocaust victims.

The ‘sheriff’ t-shirt – featuring blue stripes and a six-pointed yellow ‘badge’ - sparked anger as online commentators drew comparisons with the Star of David badges used by Nazis to denounce their Jewish victims.

Twitter users wrote 'What were the designers thinking?' alongside links to the shirt sold by Zara, which is part of Inditex, the world's biggest clothing retailer.

Others wrote: 'I never saw a blue-white striped shirt in a Wetern movie' and 'Why the stripes?

'Sheriffs wore stripes?  NO.  Jews did during WWII.' 

Today the retail chain apologised for selling the t-shirts and said they had been withdrawn from sale.

A spokesman for Zara said: 'The item in question has now been removed from all Zara stores and Zara.com. 

'The garment was inspired by the classic Western films, but we now recognize that the design could be seen as insensitive and apologize sincerely for any offence caused to our customers.'

A link to the page where the shirts were for sale was quickly taken down, and those who clicked on it were redirected to the homepage instead. 

The shirts, which were for sale in the children's section online in countries said to include the UK, Israel, Germany, France, Albania and Sweden, features horizontal rather than vertical stripes, and a six-pointed star.

But the piece of clothing bore a strong resemblance to those worn by Jews in concentration camps during the Second World War.  Meanwhile the six-pointed yellow star recalled the Star of David that Nazis forced all Jews in the Reich to wear to mark them out. 

The Nazis ordered all Jews to wear a yellow six-pointed Star of David, while concentration camp inmates were forced to wear striped outfits, pictured, which share a strong resemblance with the Zara range of clothes 

'What were the designers thinking of?' Twitters users demanded an explanation from the fashion chain

Merchandise that offends: Bags with swastikas and trainers with slaves' shackles

In 2007, Zara had to remove a line of handbags from sale after they were revealed to have swastikas on them.

Teenager Rachel Hatton, from Ashford, Kent, bought one of the £39 embroidered bags but took it back to the shop and asked for a refund after she noticed the Nazi symbol on the bag's fabric.

A spokesman for the firm said the bags had been removed and added: 'We did not realise swastikas appeared on some of these bags, the swastika was not on the bag which was sourced by us after being supplied by an external producer.'

Zara removed this bag from shelves in 2007 and Adidas scrapped these trainers said to resemble shackles

Two years ago a Danish firm called Wood Wood had to apologise after selling a shirt bearing a star that looked like the Star of David worn by Jews during the Holocaust.

In the same year, Adidas had to scrap its plans for a pair of trainers, to be named JS Roundhouse Mids, after the design was said to resemble slaves' shackles. 

And in 2002 sportswear firm Umbro had to apologise after naming a shoe Zyklon, the name of the gas used in the concentration camps
