Girl power is alive and kicking for one family who have just welcomed yet another baby girl to their female-heavy family.

Newborn Pixie-Lee is the fifth generation of a family, from Stockport, Cheshire, who can't stop having girls.

Despite her efforts to keep the sex of her baby quiet, it came as no surprise when new mother Katie Moore gave birth to Pixie-Lee on February 28.

Mother's Day is now the family's biggest yearly celebration as Pixie-Lee celebrates with mother Katie, 24, grandma Cheryl Donaldson, 48, great-grandma Lynne Styles, 66, and great-great-grandma Emily Burston, 89.

During Katie's pregnancy, her female relatives kept their fingers crossed for another lady and when the cry of 'It's a girl' came, they were all overjoyed.

Lynne said: 'When Katie was pregnant they couldn't tell what gender the baby was because of how it was lying in the womb.

'Of course we just wanted the baby to be healthy - but we were all secretly hoping for another girl.

They women said that, of course they just wanted the baby to be healthy - but they were all secretly hoping for another girl - and their wish came true

'We are a very close family, especially the women, and it's lovely to have another girl in the family.

'And to have five generations of living women is just unheard of.

'My mum is the head of the family, for 89 she is brilliant, and she is absolutely thrilled to have her first great-great-grandchild.'

Lynne's husband John was the first to realise that the family were an unusual statistic.

She added: 'It was my husband John who first pointed out that actually it was quite unusual to have five generations of women in one family.

Despite her efforts to keep the sex of her baby quiet, it was no surprise when new mother Katie gave birth to Pixie-Lee on February 28

'We weren't sure what the odds were but after speaking to people we realised it was quite rare.

'So when Katie had a little girl we were absolutely delighted. We are all going to get together this weekend to have a big family get together to celebrate Mother's Day.

'All generations of the family will be there, and now that we have a new mum it will be a really special day.'
