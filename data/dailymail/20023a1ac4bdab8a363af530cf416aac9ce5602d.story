As the longest-serving heir to the throne in British history, Prince Charles is well versed in representing his country in a ceremonial role.

And yesterday, as he reached his landmark 65th birthday, he fulfilled his official duties in India with his usual style and bonhomie.

As he walked along bustling Jew Street in the city of Cochin, Kerala, he stopped in his tracks when he heard an English voice serenading him with a tuneful version of Happy Birthday from a balcony.

Charles waited until Trish Lewis finished singing and then threw her a gift-wrapped red rose a well-wisher had given him.

After a little scrabbling, and to the prince’s cheers, the holidaymaker managed to grab the flower.

‘We couldn’t believe we were coming half way round the world and here they are,’ said Mrs Lewis, who sings with The Panda Players back home in Wendover, Bucks.

‘I feel so thrilled and flattered he threw me a rose. How wonderful. I just can’t believe it.’

As well as flowers, the prince was the recipient of no fewer than six birthday cakes yesterday – the last following a 75-minute flight from India to Sri Lanka.

At the High Commission in Colombo he was presented with a large carrot cake decorated with the Prince of Wales feathers.

The cake was so moist the slice he cut off fell from his knife.

Undeterred, he offered a morsel to his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, and popped one into his own mouth in front of a cheering crowd of wellwishers.

Back in Kerala, his staff had teased him with a cake in the shape of a free bus pass, which he can now claim as a pensioner.

Marked with Westminster Council, it said: ‘HRH Prince Charles. Valid from 14 Nov 2013. Concessionary travel funded by HM Government with your local authority. Happy 65th Birthday!’

Everywhere he went he was the centre of attention – on walkabouts,  pressing the flesh and allowing himself to be festooned with flowers in ancient Cochin.

For most people reaching the age of 65, such a relaxing and carefree day would be a fitting way to start slipping into a comfortable retirement.

But for the prince it marks the beginning of something more profound. With his mother the Queen now in her 88th year, he is likely to be asked to assume more and more of her duties as head of state.

His mission now – with his chosen consort Camilla at his side – is to prove himself a worthy king-in-waiting.

His first task – opening the Commonwealth Heads of Government conference in Sri Lanka today – is at best a challenge, at worst a diplomatic minefield.

Canada, India, and Mauritius have boycotted the meeting in protest at Sri Lanka’s alleged human rights abuses against its Tamil minority and the atmosphere in Colombo is crackling with tension.

But keeping the Commonwealth together through monumentally difficult times in the post-colonial era is one of his mother’s proudest achievements.

It is now up to Charles to show the same leadership and qualities of conciliation.

Clarence House has refused to comment on whether Charles plans to raise in private the human rights issue with Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa but Amnesty’s Steve Crawshaw urged him to take action.

‘Prince Charles is clearly in a difficult position representing the Queen who famously avoids politics in all contexts,’ he said.

‘But I very much hope that in private Prince Charles will make absolutely clear how dismayed anybody who cares about human rights would be, seeing what is happening in Sri Lanka today.

‘As the representative of the Queen he will no doubt choose his words carefully when speaking publicly, but I hope that even there we will see a reflection and understanding of how serious the problems are that Sri Lanka is facing, and one would hope that will not be swept under the carpet.’

The prince started his birthday in the £500 a night presidential suite of the luxury Kumarakom Lake Resort, situated on the banks of the Vembanad Lake, a vast stretch of tranquil, emerald green backwaters.

It wasn’t quite the romantic getaway his wife might have hoped.

Thirty rooms were booked by the royal party and close to 400 police officers took over the security of the resort.

On waking up Charles was presented with cake number one featuring a portrait of himself and his wife.

He cut a slice to enjoy on his plane later and arranged for the rest be sent to a local orphanage.

After that, however, it was very much business as usual with a break-neck string of engagements – another example of what his wife affectionately described in yesterday’s Mail as her exhausting, workaholic husband.

At a souvenir shop Charles almost set himself alight on a 100-year-old oil burner that had been lit with 65 wicks to honour his big day.

One of his Metropolitan Police protection officers lunged forwards to stop the prince’s clothing catching alight but slipped on the shop’s highly polished doorstep and stumbled against his boss – to comic effect.

It was also to Charles’s relief because of the intense heat from the wicks – and the Indian sun.

The prince woke up to a view like no other to start his birthday at the £500-a-night Presidential Suite at the luxury Kumarakom Lake Resort in rural Kerala
