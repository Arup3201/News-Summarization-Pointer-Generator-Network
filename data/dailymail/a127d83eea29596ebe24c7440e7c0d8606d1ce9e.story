Seventeen soldiers, including two sergeant majors, face being discharged from the Army after being caught using performance-enhancing drugs in the Forces’ biggest reported case of doping.

The soldiers, from the 7th Parachute Regiment Royal Horse Artillery (7 Para RHA), failed a compulsory drugs test after they used a sports supplement containing the restricted substance ephedrine, a stimulant which has similar effects to the Class B drug amphetamine, such as an increased heart rate and dizziness.

The soldiers, who follow an arduous physical training regime, are understood to have claimed they took the ephedrine – an ingredient in a type of  bodybuilding product called ‘fat stripper’ – unwittingly.

The drug is available legally as a prescription medicine but is also contained in unlicensed sports supplements sold online.

According to defence sources, the regiment’s commanding officer is now weighing up the cost of losing 17 soldiers against his obligation to the Army’s ‘zero-tolerance’ drugs policy.

The shamed soldiers were among 400 members of 7 Para RHA tested at Merville Barracks, Colchester, at the end of August. The test was apparently timed to identify those who had consumed illegal substances during the regiment’s summer holidays.

Urine samples for all personnel were examined for recreational substances such as heroin, cocaine and cannabis. The 17 soldiers facing expulsion fell foul of additional tests for controlled substances such as ephedrine.

According to Ministry of Defence guidelines, any serviceman or woman found to have taken banned drugs can expect to be discharged. However, in exceptional circumstances, a commanding officer may choose a more lenient punishment and remedial training.

Last night a regimental source said the drugs test results had shocked all the members of 7 Para RHA.

He said: ‘We expected maybe five or six fails. That’s pretty standard, especially when they test us straight after Christmas or summer leave. But 17 is off the charts, and for a pair of sergeant majors to get done too is unheard of.

‘These guys are gym rats rather than recreational drug users, and they’re guilty of being stupid for not checking what was in the fat-stripper product, but that’s all.

'A warning needs to be sent across the Army about the dangers of these products. A lot of guys are pumping iron and overdoing it. They could pay a high price.’

An MoD spokesman said last night: ‘The Armed Forces have a zero-tolerance approach to inappropriate behaviour, including substance misuse.

'Where an individual is found, through compulsory drug testing or other investigation, to have fallen short of the Services’ high standards, they will be dealt with through the military discipline process.’
