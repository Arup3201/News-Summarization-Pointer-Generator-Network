It is one of those stressful moments, just before a holiday, when you realise you have packed so much you can't close your suitcase.

And even if you manage to successfully perch on top and close the zip, who knows what state your summer wardrobe will emerge in when you arrive at your destination. 

Which is perhaps why there are such things as 'professional packers'. Ivica Tot-Genz, from Berlin's Hotel de Rome, is one such professional and is full of handy hints and tips to transport your worldly goods without the stress.

Packing can seem like a chore, but there are ways to make it less painful and more efficient

In fact, he is so good at his job, he can pack up the perfect suitcase in 15 minutes flat.

Mr Tot-Genz learned his skills as a parachute packer in the army and states that anyone can use his tricks at home. 

'Trousers should be rolled up with tissue paper,' he said.

'If you are on holiday and have to take party clothes, a dress or suit, just use paper towels from the kitchen.'

He stuffs the arms of suit jackets with tissue paper to avoid creases and uses cardboard to easily fold shirts and help them keep their shape. 

'You can do these tricks at home, it's done in a certain order,' he said.   

Roll your items to make best use of the space in your suitcase. There will also be less creases in your clothes

1. Use buttons to transport earrings

2. To avoid creases, pack your clothes in plastic wrappings

3. To avoid your shoe soles touching your clothes, place them in shower caps

4. Stuff your shoes with socks, underwear or other small items to make the most of the space and to help them keep their shape

5. To avoid shampoos leaking in your bag, unscrew the lid and place a small circle of cling film, or plastic wrap over the hole. Screw the lid back on to hold it in place, and eliminate all worries about bursting liquids

6. Wrap breakables, such as perfume bottles, or a teacup if you are Miranda Kerr, in socks to protect them

7. Keep freebie shampoos and cosmetics from hotels so you don't have to lug big bottles 

8. Alternatively store face cream and small lotions in contact lens containers to save space

9. Wrap your belts round the outside of the suitcase, around your clothes to make use of the outside corner space

10. Place a dryer sheet in your case, or in the shoe shower cap to prevent odours transferring to your clothes

11. Apply a bull clip to razors that have lost their safety lid to prevent tearing of clothes

The roll vs the layer

Heathrow Airport has produced a video with tips on how to pack, advocating the layer method. 

This works on larger items such as dresses and trousers being laid flat on top of the case. 

The packer continues to layer clothes up with the lengths poking out either side of the suitcase, until all clothes are stacked. 

You then individually fold the clothes back in on themselves for minimal creases. 

Professional packer Ivica Tot-Genz uses plastic tissue between layers to prevent creasing. If you do not have any to hand, paper towel works just as well

Elika Gibbs, of of wardrobe organisers Practical Princess, is also an advocate of layering.

In previous advice to the MailOnline, she advised: 'Make sure everything is clean and pressed before you begin packing. Pack things flat to stop them creasing during the journey. Jackets are the most awkward: either wear one, pack it at the bottom or, if it's a business trip, use a suit carrier.

'The next layer is your cocktail dresses then your tops and bottoms. Turn delicates and things whose colours might run, such as suede, inside out.

'Separate your clothes from items that might damage them, such as sequins, by using tissue paper.

'Use your underwear to fill in the gaps and put your shoes on the top, in either shoe bags or plastic bags.' 

The roll method is favoured by many, with creases minimised and space maximised. 

Fans of this packing technique advise placing your shoes and heavy objects in the bag first. 

You then need to fill in all the space around them with your rolled up items, and fit your small accessories in the gap between clothes. 

If using a smaller bag for things like swimming costumes or underwear, roll the bag as well once you are ready to pack it. 

While packing a suitcase the correct way is all-important for squeezing all those essentials in, hand luggage is just as important.

Globetrotting models and celebrities love nothing more than posting pictures of their jetset lifestyles and what better to pick up a few travel tips than by checking out their Instagram posts?

While Rosie Huntington-Whiteley loved comfortable leggings and a cosy cashmere sweater, model Karlie Kloss swears by good reading materials for the flight and a pair of rose-gold Frends headphones.

Model Karlie Kloss shared a snap on Instagram showing exactly what she carries in her hand luggage 

Taylor Swift's best friend shared a snap of her must-haves while passing through security. Among them were the latest issue of The Economist, Vanity Fair and The Wall Street Journal (clearly the model is well-read), as well as stylish Nike trainers and two smartphones: an iPhone and a Blackberry.

She also showed off a chic monogrammed passport wallet from Louis Vuitton and a sleek Canon digital camera.
