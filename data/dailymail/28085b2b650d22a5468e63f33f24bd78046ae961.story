A judge in the U.S has ruled that labeling homosexuality 'a disease' in adverts for controversial gay conversion therapy groups is fraud.

Superior Court Judge Peter F. Barsio Jr ruled on Tuesday that using the claim in marketing is a violation of New Jersey's consumer protection laws. 

The state judge made the ruling as part of a consumer fraud lawsuit filed against Jews Offering New Alternatives for Healing (JONAH), a New Jersey-based conversion therapy provider.

'Conversion' or 'reparative' therapy is the attempt by individuals, often posing as professionals, to try and alter the sexuality of lesbian, gay or bisexual patients. 

The Southern Poverty Law Center brought the lawsuit on behalf of four gay ex-JONAH clients, claiming the group used 'deceptive practices' to lure clients to pay for gay-to-straight therapy - which  can cost more than $10,000 a year, reports NBC.

Judge Barsio wrote in his ruling: 'It is a misrepresentation in violation of the CFA (Consumer Fraud Act), in advertising or selling conversion therapy services to describe homosexuality, not as being a normal variation of human sexuality, but as being a mental illness, disease, disorder, or equivalent.'

He added JONAH was violating the CFA by 'advertising or selling conversion therapy services, to include specific 'success' statistics when there is no factual basis for calculating such statistics.'

David Dinielli, SPLC's deputy legal director said in a statement: 'This ruling is monumental and devastating to the conversion therapy industry.

'This is the principal lie the conversion therapy industry uses throughout the country to peddle its quackery to vulnerable clients.

'Gay people don't need to be cured, and we are thrilled that the court has recognized this.'

The UK Council for Psychotherapy states on its website: 'There is no good evidence conversion therapy works and we believe it has the potential to cause harm.

'Often these approaches are based on religious interpretations about sexuality rather than on a researched and informed understanding of sexual orientation.' 

The American Psychiatric Association said conversion therapy can cause depression and anxiety in patients.

JONAH's mission statement says: 'Our Rabbinical sages explain that because mankind has been endowed by our Creator with a free will, everyone has the capacity to change.

'Furthermore, the Rabbis emphasize that parents, teachers and counselors have a special responsibility to educate, nurture, and provide an opportunity for those struggling with unwanted same-sex attractions to journey out of homosexuality.

'Through psychological and spiritual counseling, peer support, and self-empowerment, JONAH seeks to reunify families, to heal the wounds surrounding homosexuality, and to provide hope.'
