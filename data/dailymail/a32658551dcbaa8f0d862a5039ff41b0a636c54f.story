Thousands of summer-born children will be able to start school a year later to stop them being disadvantaged by the age gap with their winter-born classmates.

There is growing evidence that children born late in the academic year who start school at four are already at a disadvantage just 12 months later.

Ministers have now sent guidance to schools and councils that could end the anguish of parents whose children are forced to start formal education at barely four.

Under the new plan, children born in summer will be allowed to start at five (picture posed by models)

They acted after becoming concerned about the number of disputes between education authorities and parents over the issue.

The guidelines make it clear that parents have the right to request their summer-born children start reception classes at five instead.

Schools and councils must consider the requests in light of ‘research into the outcomes of summer-born and premature children’. The advice applies to those born between April 1 and August 31.

The Department for Education guidance says: ‘In recent months, an increasing number of cases have come to the attention of the department and ministers in which parents, local authorities and admissions authorities have struggled to agree on the year group in which it is most appropriate for a summer-born child to start school.’

The advice, drawn up with help from parents, adds: ‘There are no statutory barriers to admitting a child of five to a reception class.’

Department for Education figures show 62 per cent of those born between May and August fail to meet minimum expected levels in areas such as reading, writing, speaking, maths and listening.

By contrast, just 40 per cent of children born between September and December fall behind. The report said: ‘Month of birth has the largest impact on the literacy and mathematics areas of learning.’

Separate research has shown that, on average, summer-borns do worse at GCSE and A-level and are less likely to go to university. They are also more likely to be bullied and be unhappy at school.

The Institute of Fiscal Studies says the disparity between September and August-born children is so great that summer-borns should be given weighted test results to compensate.

Campaigners welcomed the guidance yesterday but called on ministers to go further and introduce an absolute right for summer-borns to start reception classes at five.

Pauline Hull, 40, of Farnham, Surrey, wants her May-born son Jack to start school at five, but the county council has refused.

She said some councils try to make summer-borns who wanted to start school later join year one instead of reception, forcing them to lose a year of education.

Mrs Hull, 40, who helps run the group Flexible School Admissions For Summer Born Children, added: ‘Councils are worried about the floodgates opening.’
