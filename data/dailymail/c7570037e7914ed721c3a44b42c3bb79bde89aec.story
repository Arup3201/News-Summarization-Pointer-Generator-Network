Chaz Bono and fiancée Jennifer Elia have called off their engagement.

The couple - who have dated since 1999 - have not only cancelled plans to get hitched but have decided to end their relationship entirely.

His spokesperson Howard Bragman said today: ‘They leave this relationship with great love, respect and affection toward one another.

'No further amplification will be forthcoming and they ask that you respect their privacy at this time.'

Earlier today, Chaz tweeted: 'Thanks for your concern about our separation. I'm doing fine, and we remain on good terms with nothing but respect and affection 4 eachother.'

Just last month singer Cher’s transgender son, was shown popping the question during his one-hour TV-show special Being Chaz, which aired on the Oprah Winfrey Network.

The programme was a follow-up to his Emmy-nominated documentary Becoming Chaz which focused on his transition from female to male.

Elia - who writing a book - supported the 42-year-old during his gender reassignment process and later said she found her partner 'more attractive' as a man.

She said that their intimate relationship as 'straight couple' improved 'for the good.'

Chaz, who is now almost four years into the transition, also agreed that the couple were enjoying a healthy sex life.

'We feel very lucky,' he told Piers Morgan in May.

She was also regularly seen cheering him on from the audience during his time on Dancing With The Stars earlier this year.

But Elia revealed that
the process of dealing with Chaz's transition was difficult at times, 
admitting that she started drinking again when he told her that he made 
the final decision about changing genders.

'Well I can't blame it solely on Chaz's transition, my sobriety has always been a problem,' she told Morgan during the same May interview.

'When he told me about this, I used it as a pass to fall off the wagon which is what alcoholics tend to do.'

'I was sober when we meet, when things go bad I drink. When Chaz told me about this, I told him I needed a drink.'

Elia said she was a year and two months sober, and that she felt that the transition had become easier for the couple.

'Things have levelled out,' she said.

Chaz is the only child of American artists Sonny and Cher although both have offspring from other relationships.
