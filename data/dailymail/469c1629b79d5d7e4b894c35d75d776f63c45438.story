He was only officially told that he was playing two hours before kickoff but in reality there was no doubt.

The man who humiliated England on one leg four weeks after a knee operation was hardly going to wait another second once his four-month ban was over. Luis Suarez was back in a competitive game on Saturday for the first time since sinking his teeth into Giorgio Chiellini.

And while Real Madrid were being vociferously serenaded in the Bernabeu after a masterful performance, it was easy to forget Suarez might have won Barcelona the game early on.

Here was the Suarez we know, charging around, unable to concede any cause, however lost. And here was the quality at which we came to wonder in the precise, raking cross that found Neymar on three minutes to open the scoring.

He did it again on 23 minutes, another delightful ball from the right into the path of Lionel Messi. On this occasion Iker Casillas made a fantastic save. And on that moment the game turned.

‘We could have scored the second,’ said Suarez. ‘After that, they hurt us with their tactics and killed us on the counter. We have a one-point advantage in the league so we have to be positive.’

Suarez was a constant thorn in the side of the Real Madrid defence and caused havoc on his Barcelona debut

Afterwards his manager Luis Enrique deemed that he had done ‘pretty well — better than expected.’ He lasted 68 minutes and in that first half especially was a major contributor.

The ‘bittersweet’ feeling Suarez spoke of after was the fact that his return was tempered by such a dominant Real Madrid victory. By the end the Bernabeu was united in a chorus of Viva Espana — a poke in the eye of growing Catalan nationalism — and roaring those ‘Oles’ as their team passed the ball around.

As Pepe, scorer of the second goal, said: ‘It’s a long time since we heard “Oles” at the Bernabeu against Barcelona.’

Real looked formidable, much more than a team of Galacticos, but a balanced unit. The fear for Suarez is that he has joined Barcelona just as the balance of power is tilting Real’s way.

In most areas, Real Madrid were superior. You will struggle to find defenders as strong as Pepe and Sergio Ramos or midfielders with the poise of Toni Kroos and Luka Modric. The greatest compliment you can pay Kroos and Modric is that they made Xavi and Andres Iniesta look old.

Cristiano Ronaldo surpassed Messi in the battle of the superstars but he was just one of many, with Isco and Karim Benzema also excellent. ‘I have a very professional team who understand what it means sacrifice themselves for the team,’ said manager Carlo Ancelotti. ‘To win against Barcelona in the manner we did is really important.’
