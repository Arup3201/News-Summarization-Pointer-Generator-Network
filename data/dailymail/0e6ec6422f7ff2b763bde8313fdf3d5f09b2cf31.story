For two clubs whose rivalry was enhanced by a ship canal, rarely have Manchester United and Liverpool entered a derby contest with defences equally distant from what you might call watertight.

Pub standard, was Gary Neville’s acerbic take – the Dog and Duck against the Red Lion. Ouch.

Louis Van Gaal bristled. Brendan Rodgers should do likewise. But the undeniable fact is that those selected to guard goals at either end on Sunday will not measure up to figures who have come before. 

Manchester United have struggled at the back this season with Louis van Gaal yet to find a settled pairing

Liverpool long for a defender of Alan Hansen's (centre) stature given their struggles this season

Sami Hyypia was another towering force in the Liverpool defence which is now full of holes

Rio Ferdinand was the most expensive British player when he joined United in 2002 for £30m

Neither team possesses a centre-back with the leadership of Steve Bruce or Ron Yeats, the collectedness of Rio Ferdinand or Alan Hansen, the physicality of Nemanja Vidic or Tommy Smith.

That is not to say these current defences are write-offs. Certain players have shown glimpses to impress. But right now, the shadow of predecessors is cast large.

Let’s take Bruce. He exuded calm and instilled belief across the back, captaining a United team of formidable characters as the Premier League came to rest at Old Trafford.

There was also that famous late brace against Sheffield Wednesday, showing as much about his guts as aerial prowess. Then aged 35, Bruce helped nurture the likes of Neville during his second double season.

In similar mode – Yeats led Liverpool on their ascendancy in the early 60s. Bought by Bill Shankly and given the armband, he was a substantial presence. ‘The man is a mountain, go into the dressing room and walk around him,’ Shankly told journalists on his signing.

Yeats got Liverpool promoted from the Second Division and then won two First Division titles and an FA Cup.

Lacking for each of United and Liverpool, is a player at the heart of defence who can be turned to for inspiration when the turf begins to shake.

Neither is there a defender who can be trusted to always remain cool under pressure.

Ferdinand had that skill, a composure to perform that sharp turn to find space when confronted with an onrushing attacker, rather than kick the ball into touch.

He left United with a Champions League and six Premier League titles in his baggage.

Hansen won three European Cups and eight First Division crowns and was imperative to Liverpool’s sustained period of dominance.

Eschewing the option to boot the ball forwards, he would be more inclined to dribble out from the back, hence his years on Match of the Day bemoaning diabolical defending.

Defences work on unity, of course. Bruce formed a redoubtable understanding with Gary Pallister that enhanced both of their games, Ferdinand’s silk was allied by Vidic’s steel.

Hansen had Phil Thompson, then Mark Lawrenson as sidekick – finding hand and glove twice is fortunate but more testament to the players’ talents.

Under Van Gaal, obtaining a settled defence is more likely than locating the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow – and that uncertainty is debilitating.

Paddy McNair has shown promise but was hooked before half-time at Southampton having endured a torrid match. Tyler Blackett needs time to develop.

Chris Smalling, Jonny Evans and Phil Jones are injured too frequently to build up a head of steam – and Marcos Rojo simply does not look a centre-back.

Rodgers would have hoped Dejan Lovren would form a solid union with Martin Skrtel, but each have gone backwards from last season.

Kolo Toure has got some games but is prone to mistakes, and we are still waiting to see why Mamadou Sakho cost £18million.

How Van Gaal would long for countryman Jaap Stam in his pomp – a courageous carrier of the ball and man of granite stature.

How Rodgers would call up in a flash a prime-age Jamie Carragher – a defender of nous and bravery.

Then there is Paul McGrath and Bill Foulkes, Emlyn Hughes and Sami Hyypia; great defenders each.

It is a pity we cannot yet say the same about those taking the pitch this weekend. High standards. But that is the measure at these clubs.
