Britain saw its coldest evening since last winter's cold snap as temperatures plunged to -5C (23F) overnight, with more freezing temperatures forecast for today.

Forecasters said temperatures are likely to remain cold this week, with a chance snow could fall in parts of the North and South West by Friday as Britain is set to become even colder. 

However evidence of the mild weather of the last few months, which has put 2014 on course to be the warmest ever, still remain after  daffodils were spotted growing in the UK and grapes were seen on the vine as winter officially started.

A heavy frost was seen in the Lake District this morning after the coldest temperatures since last winter were recorded overnight in Cumbria 

There were snowy scenes along the River Brathay in Cumbria today as walkers braced themselves for more cold and possible snow on Friday

Despite temperatures plunging to below zero in Scotland this week, grapes were found growing on the side of a house in Edinburgh. While in Lincolnshire the official start of winter was marked by a daffodil blooming in a garden.

The mercury plunged to -5.1C (22.6F) in Shap in Cumbria last night - the coldest temperature of this year's autumn and winter season, which officially started on December 1.

It was even colder than in Scotland, which saw -4.1C recorded in Aboyne, a village on the edge if the Scottish highlands, overnight, and saw walkers enjoy the first deep snow of winter in the Cairngorms in the east Highlands yesterday.

Elsewhere in the country extra blankets and hats were needed to deal with the cold snap, with -2.6C (27F) recorded in Bala in North Wales and -1.3C (30F) in Okehampton in West Devon overnight. London was substantially warmer, with temperatures of around 2.5C overnight, with similar expected this evening. 

However Thursday night is expected to be even colder for much of the country, and forecasters said there was a 'slim chance' snow could fall in parts of the Pennines and North Wales by the end of this week.

There is also a possibility of wintry showers in exposed areas of the south as the mercury is expected to dip to as low as -2C (28F) during the day in Bristol on Friday. And a minimum temperature of -5C (23F) is forecast for the Oxfordshire village of Benson overnight, according to the Met Office.

As the mercury plunged to -2C in Scotland, grapes were spotted growing on the side of a house where philosopher Thomas Carlyle once lived

Mike Williamson said he was shocked to discover grapes, which he planted 15 years ago, were growing up the side of his Edinburgh home 

In Lincolnshire Marilyn Fenn found a daffodil blooming in her garden three months earlier and just after the official start of winter for the UK 

Temperatures fell on Tuesday night after a warm weekend which saw giant cobwebs emerge in fields across Jersey. Warm temperatures on Saturday led to millions of spiders taking advantage of the mild conditions to move from one place to another using huge gossamer webs 

Environmentalists said the appearance of the large webs was 'incredibly rare' and had been spun by millions of money spiders on Saturday 

Nicola Maxey, a forecaster for the Met Office, said: 'On higher ground in the South there's a chance that we might see some sleet, and a slim chance of snow on Friday.'

Cloudy and breezy weather is forecast today, with a chance of showers throughout the day as a weak weather front moves across the country.

Tomorrow is expected to be much more cloudy and grey, with a chance of showers in the South East and Midlands which may turn to sleet by Friday.

Ms Maxey added: 'These showers could turn a bit wintry in exposed areas such as in Newcastle and the Pennines, but accumulations are unlikely. There is also a risk of fog patches.' 

After a heavy frost there were snowy scenes this morning as photographers beat the cold temperatures and wrapped up warm in Cumbria 

Last night's cold snap made way for clear and calm skies this morning and a stunning early morning sunrise over River Brathay in Cumbria

As Cumbria is bracing itself for temperatures well below freezing, the heavy frost this morning was reflected in Elterwater in the Lake District 

Picture postcard scenes of snow covered trees were seen in the Lake District after Shap in Cumbria recorded winter's coldest temperature 

However traces of the mild months of 2014 remain after Mike Williamson discovered huge bunches of white grapes flourishing on the side of his Edinburgh home, where Thomas Carlyle lived in the 1820s. 

Mr Williamson planted the grapes 15 years ago and only discovered they were growing when a window cleaner visited the home he shares with his wife Hil, 64, this week. 

He said: 'We do have grapes on it every year as the wall is south facing and there is good soil so it grows very well especially in this beautiful year we've had. The grapevines are mostly just in our garden for decoration and, I must admit, we don't really pay too much attention to it.' 

Experts said the appearance of the grapes was unusual, but can be explained following our warm summer and unseasonably mild autumn.

A car in the Peak District was covered with frost this morning and motorists are being warned to be careful as more cold weather is expected

The cold snap made for clear skies and picturesque sunrises in the Peak District, but people are being warned to brace themselves tonight 

Gritters were out on the A66 Trans Pennine route tonight as temperatures are expected to dip further, making driving conditions dangerous 

In Lincolnshire, where temperatures have also plunged this week, grandmother Marilyn Fenn spotted a lone daffodil growing in her garden in Woodhall Spa. The daffodil, traditionally seen in Spring, has appeared three months early despite the freezing temperatures of this week. Others have also reported seeing snowdrops in their garden, which also usually appear in spring.

This year is set to be the warmest on record after every month so far except August was warmer than the average. 

Warm temperatures at the weekend also saw thousands of spider webs cover the countryside in Jersey.  

As unseasonably high temperatures of hit 16C money spiders spun thousands of webs - called gossamers - to migrate from one place to another. Local environmentalist Mike Stentiford said is was extremely rare to see the webs appear over such a wide area.

Last night's freezing night in the Peak District made for pink skies as the son rose and fields covered with frost as winter gets off to a cold start

Thursday is expected to be a particularly wet day, with cooler temperatures meaning showers could turn into sleet and light snow showers 

People in Cumbria (left) are to prepare for another freezing evening tonight, while sheep were in frosty fields near Roseberry Topping, a hill on the border between North Yorkshire and Redcar and Cleveland (right), where temperatures dropped to -2C overnight on Tuesday

He said: 'It is just literally squillions of tiny money spiders and it is their way of moving from one place to another. We normally get it in one or two fields but it seemed to me that the whole of the island was absolutely covered with it. It was absolutely amazing.'

However a cold December could threaten that record, as forecasters say frost is expected this week.  

Friday is expected to be a wetter and windier day, with stronger winds forecast for the North West. In the South East milder conditions are expected, with temperatures back to the average for December. 

Walkers in the Cairngorms, dubbed the snowiest place in Britain in a recent Met Office survey, enjoyed the first snow of winter yesterday as they trudged through deep snow, leading to hopes of a white Christmas for the UK this year.

People in Edinburgh woke up to a crisp morning and a pretty sun rise from Arthur's Seat to Edinburgh Castle after the mercury plunged to -4C

The sunrise in Edinburgh this morning created a perfect silhouette for Edinburgh's skyline as people woke after a freezing cold night 

In Leeds light frost covered Roundhay Park this morning after the mercury plunged to below zero overnight and another cold night is forecast

A supply vessel moved past Aberdeen Harbour this morning, the only movement among the clear skies of a freezing early morning 

People in Aberdeen this morning woke up to a bright red sunrise, accompanied by freezing temperatures as the mercury is set to fall 

The snow in Scotland led to warnings being issued by police about the dangers of driving on the A939 in the Cairngorms because of the recent snow and ice. 

And with forecasts of snow for the rest of England, comes a warning about the dangers and health risks of plunging temperatures.

The onset of the colder weather has led Public Health England to think about their health during the cold snap - 25,000 extra people usually die in England during winter, with the elderly particularly vulnerable.

The sunrise over Aberdeen harbour showed clear skies as earlier risers walked their dogs and caught the sight along the coast this morning 

Aberdeen is set to become even colder as the Cairngorms saw the first snow of winter yesterday, and temperatures plunged to -4C overnight 

A recent study by the Met Office found that snow has fallen 38 times in the last 52 years - meaning we can expect around half of our Christmases to be 'white.' 

However the traditional festive image of trees dusted in white, is more likely to be confined to Christmas cards. Snow settling on the ground is much rarer, and has happened just four times in the last 51 years.

Commuters will also be hopeful that the Christmas season will not be a repeat of last year, when parts of England were drenched by heavy rain - leaving large parts of the Somerset Levels submerged for months.
