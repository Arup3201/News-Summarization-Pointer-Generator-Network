Drugs cheat Lance Armstrong has revealed that he would probably 'do it again' if his cycling career were to start over.

The United States Anti Doping Agency (USADA) banned the 43-year-old from the sport for life in 2012, as well as stripping him of his seven Tour de France titles. Armstrong had denied all charges, but then admitted to doping in an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2013.

The Texas-born rider has been out of the public light since an exclusive interview with Sportsmail's Matt Lawton later that year, but tells the BBC he now believes it is time for forgiven.

Shamed cyclist Lance Armstrong says he would cheat all over again if the year was 1995

Armstrong admits that while he wouldn't consider cheating again in today's sport, he would in 1995 because of the growth in cycling during his successful years, and the funds received by the Lance Armstrong Foundation, the charity he set up after survivng a cancer scare.

Asked if he would cheat again by Dan Roan, Armstrong says: 'It's a complicated question, and my answer is not a popular answer. If I was racing in 2015, no, I wouldn't do it again, because I don't think you have to. 

'If you take me back to 1995, when it was completely and totally pervasive, I'd probably do it again. People don't like to hear that.'

'When I made the decision - when my team-mates made that decision, when the whole peloton made that decision - it was a bad decision and an imperfect time. But it happened.

'When Lance Armstrong did that, I know what happened. I know what happened to cycling from 1999 to 2005. I saw its growth, I saw its expansion.

'I know what happened to the cycling industry. I know what happened to [his bike supplier and sponsor] Trek Bicycles - $100m (£66.5m) in sales, to $1bn in sales.

'I know what happened to my foundation, from raising no money to raising $500m, serving three million people. Do we want to take that away? I don't think anybody says yes.'

Armstrong believes he has been made to pay a heavy personal price for an offence he says was committed by many, and is hoping for a reduction in his ban after twice speaking with the Cycling Independent Reform Commission (CIRC).

He also believes his seven Tour titles should be restored.

'I think there has to be a winner, I'm just saying that as a fan,' he said. 'There's a huge block in World War One with no winners, and there's another block in World War Two, and then it seems like there's another world war.

'I don't think history is stupid, history rectifies a lot of things. If you ask me what happens in 50 years, I don't think it sits empty... I feel like I won those Tours.'
