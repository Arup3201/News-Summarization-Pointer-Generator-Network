In the strange, virtual world of the Twitterati, he was a massive celebrity.

Alan TBH Plumptre might have been only a cute pooch, but his internet following won fans from showbiz, TV and publishing.

Alas, Alan is no more. To a grieving nation, it was announced yesterday that the in-house pet of top people’s magazine Tatler had died in a tragic accident.

Tragic: Alan TBH Plumptre, the in-house dachshund of Tatler magazine - based in Vogue House, on Hanover Square, central London - reportedly died after his neck got caught in a revolving door yesterday

Cute: The dog's death has been mourned on Twitter, with one user saying: 'He looked like such a sweetheart'

The long and the short of it is that 
the young dachshund got trapped in a revolving door … and didn’t make it
to the other side.

According to The Daily Telegraph, the dog was being walked by the office intern when it became trapped in the revolving doors.

The dog is believed to have become distracted by a passing jogger when it decided to make a dash for it.

Ten firefighters and all the 
technology on two fire engines couldn’t save him from a gruesome end to 
his brief life. Yesterday staff at the Condé Nast publishing empire 
headquarters in London were said to be ‘in mourning’.

Alan, beloved companion of editor’s 
assistant Jennifer George, had been a familiar face at Vogue House in 
Hanover Square since October.

He travelled daily to work and became a 
favourite of editorial, administrative and advertising staff.

But it was on Twitter that the 
long-haired miniature dachshund found stardom, with regular tweets on 
his day-to-day experiences and observations, often accompanied by 
photographs.

In less than four months, @TatlerAlan (‘Office Manager at 
Tatler by day, The Badger Hunter by night’, according to his tag) saw 
his online following rise to more than 2,500.

The fact he had more followers than 
some of the senior executives might have gone to his fluffy head, but it
also gave him the confidence to produce a succession of tweets that 
attracted attention from the likes of former glamour model Katie Price 
and Rosie Fortescue, of Channel 4’s Made in Chelsea show.

On his first day at work, it was 
revealed he had ‘first-day jitters’, but that they were ‘calmed by the 
fact that I was carried into the office like a king’.

Two hours later he
tweeted he was ‘****ing knackered’.

Subsequent updates disclosed that he had left rather unsavoury calling cards on the office carpet or on the train home.

It also emerged that he had an eye for
the ladies, befriending the foxiest young women in the office and 
passing comment.

One tweet described his first experience of going to 
the pub after work for a drink with Jennifer, whom he called Mum: 
‘People chatting up Mum: 0. People chatting up me: 17.’

News of the accident trended on 
Twitter yesterday and brought messages of sympathy from around the 
world.

Jennifer, whose partner is the son of George Plumptre, who was 
Princess Diana’s first boyfriend, posted the announcement of his death.

She followed it with a last photo and said Alan was ‘so awesome and so 
very loved’.

On the desk: The @TatlerAlan Twitter account for the dog had gathered more than 2,500 followers - including Rosie Fortescue of Channel 4 TV show Made In Chelsea and Glamour magazine editor Jo Elvin

Last picture: Tatler editor's assistant Jennifer George, who owned the dog, posted a photo of him on Twitter, saying: 'He was so awesome and so very loved'

Initial reports about Alan’s demise 
were almost too awful to contemplate, with disturbing details of his 
injuries after he got stuck in the spinning door at Vogue House.

Later it transpired that he was 
returning from a lunchtime stroll with an unnamed member of staff, and 
made a dash for the door after spotting a man he knew walking through 
it.

Alan apparently got his head stuck, trapping both himself and the 
man inside.

London Fire Brigade sent two appliances with a crew each. They freed the man safely but couldn’t save Alan.

Condé Nast confirmed that Alan had ‘passed away’ but declined to give further detail.
