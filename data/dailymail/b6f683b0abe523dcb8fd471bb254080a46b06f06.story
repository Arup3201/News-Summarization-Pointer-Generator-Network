Cars and trucks could finally be rolling into a city at the end of the trans-Alaska pipeline by Wednesday afternoon, nearly two weeks after avalanches cut off highway access.

Banks of snow about 40ft high were dumped on Richardson Highway, which runs parallel to the trans-Alaska pipeline.

A spokeswoman for the Alaska Department of Transportation has said that road crews are nearing completion of snow removal from the last blockage of the Richardson Highway, about 12 miles from Valdez. The highway is projected to open at 3 p.m. Wednesday.

The weight of snow damned the Lowe River, creating a half-mile long lake filled with 500 million gallons of icy water.

Hannah Blankenship said damage has 
mostly been limited to guardrails. Previous avalanches had not damaged 
the roadbed, and that was the case again.

A
 dozen or so avalanches combined to close the highway January 24, 
including two that completely covered the highway and about 10 that 
partially covered it.

Heavy early winter snow was followed 
in January by unseasonably warm temperatures and then rain. The 
precipitation triggered avalanches. One major avalanche was in Thompson 
Pass at Mile 39. That avalanche and the smaller ones were cleared last 
week.

A second major 
avalanche filled Keystone Canyon, which begins at Mile 12 and is roughly
 300 feet wide. Snow piled up on the road 40 to 50 feet high from canyon
 wall to canyon wall for 1,000 to 1,500 feet.

It
 also dammed the Lowe River, creating a lake that covered 2,500 feet of 
highway.

The lake created by the avalanche had 
been slowly draining over the past couple of days, but after receding to
 1,500ft it had stopped, a spokeswoman for the transport department 
said.

Excavation crews could not reach the upstream side of the 
avalanche until Friday after water drained or returned to the river 
channel.

The highway department also reduced the threat of additional 
avalanches by dropping explosives from a helicopter in avalanche chutes.

About
 10 workers at a time with excavators, bulldozers, loaders and a 'rock 
truck,' described as high-volume dump truck with extra-large wheels, 
have been working in 12-hours shifts around the clock since Friday to 
remove snow.

The department completed stability tests to ensure the 
highway could support heavy loads.

Crews
 were giving the walls of snow parallel to the highway a slope to snow 
does not slough off into the roadway, Blankenship said.

Valdez remained accessible by air and water. A helicopter has been airlifting in supplies and the postal service is reportedly still working.

Despite
 the only road in being closed, a couple from Copper Center, which is 
about 100 miles away, managed to hike through the avalanches to get 
their sick cat to the town's vet.

Kristina
 Clark and Donney Carlson were able to get life-saving treatment their 
pet, Ninja, needed, but the couple were also arrested for ignoring 
police who told them not to enter the avalanche zone.
