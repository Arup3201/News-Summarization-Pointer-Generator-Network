Gareth Southgate has insisted players such as Luke Shaw and Calum Chambers should not view coming back into the England Under 21 fold following senior honours as a ‘punishment’.

The two full-backs, who moved from Southampton to Manchester United and Arsenal for a combined £46million, have both been named in Southgate’s squad for their Euro 2015 play-off against Croatia.

Shaw was part of Roy Hodgson’s squad for the World Cup while Chambers earned his first England cap in last month’s friendly against Norway.

Luke Shaw has three previous caps for the England Under 21s, but has pulled out of the squad on four occasions.  

But Southagte, who also named Saido Berahino, Harry Kane and Eric Dier in his squad, said there should be more movement between youth groups and the senior team to aid players’ development.

‘It shouldn’t be seen as players coming back down, like that’s some sort of punishment,’ Southgate said. 

‘It should be seen as part of their development. ‘We’ve got to make that movement between squads more fluid. Because we haven’t done it so often in past it’s viewed slightly negatively at times.

‘We feel it is the right thing to do. It's a positive message, to show they are prepared to come and join in with the rest of the group is important.

Gareth Southgate has also named West Brom forward Saido Berahino in his 23-man squad 

‘Roy and myself work very closely every time there's a squad announced and clearly Luke and Calum have been around the senior squad already.

‘The fact it's a play-off game Roy was keen that those who he didn't think would start for him were with us. That's the joined-up thinking we're trying to put in place.

‘The boys have to come and have the desire to come and do that. They understand the situation because getting to the finals is important.’

The first match in the play-off takes place on October 10 at Molineux, with the return leg in Vinkovci four days later.
