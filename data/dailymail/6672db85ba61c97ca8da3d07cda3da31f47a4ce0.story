As brave Aimee Copeland walked on to the Katie Couric show to talk about her remarkable journey, there was not a dry eye in the house.

The 24-year-old, from Snelville, Georgia, was struck by a rare flesh-eating bacteria after a zip-lining accident on May 1 which left her clinging on to life before eventually claiming her hands, legs and foot.

Today was her first TV appearance since she was released from hospital in July and Aimee demonstrated her remarkable recovery by coming on the show with the aid of a walker and one prosthetic leg.

Journey: Aimee revealed that core strength and arm strength is important for her to be able to walk which she was just able to do for the first time a week ago

Remarkable: There was not a dry eye in the house when Aimee Copeland came on the Katie Couric show with the aid of a walker

Brave: The 24-year-old was smiling and optimistic throughout and told Katie she never considered giving up because she 'loves life'

Young love: Aimee revealed for the first time that her boyfriend has been with her every step of her remarkable journey and that she can see her spending the rest of her life with him

Couric herself could not contain her emotion at Aimee's remarkable recovery and tears spilled down her cheeks.

The University of West Georgia student appeared to be the only person in the studio able to hold her emotions together as she beamed and smiled from the moment she walked in, describing it as 'awesome'.

She also revealed that her boyfriend Ben has stuck by her through the whole remarkable journey.

Asked by Katie if she ever worried he would turn around one day and say: 'You know Aimee I can't do this any more,' she laughed and said: 'No not really.

'Because he's really great 
and we have been together through so many hard times. I look at him 
and I see myself with him and I think he thinks that too.

'It's remarkable
how laid back he is even when I'm being a grouch. When I stood up for 
the first time he started crying, it was really sweet.'

Speaking about her time in hospital, she revealed the worst moment came when her dad Andy lifted up her hand for her to see. Her fingers were black and her hands blood red.

He said to her: 'This isn't healthy is it? We’re going to have to cut them off.'

Describing the experience she said: 'It was a very intense moment. I said, "let’s do this!" What else are you going to do?'

And as a testament to her courage and optimism, when asked if she ever considered giving up at any time, Aimee smiled and said: 'Dying was never an option, I love 
life, it’s a beautiful thing.

'I don’t take for granted
anymore how beautiful it is. Seeing the sunrise, ocean, animals, the 
senses are so deepened.

Smell, everything smells better, colors are more
vibrant than ever before. Instead of saying I’m disabled, I say I have 
different abilities.'

Normal life: Aimee talks about how she has had to adapt to living without hands and feet but says she is looking forward to learning how to drive again

iPhone: Voice activation software is a massive help for Aimee as she reveals she uses Siri to text and call her friends

Rehab: Aimee can now do 300 sit ups and is focusing on her upper body strength so she can manoeuvre her body around more easily

Shocked: Aimee Copeland was gifted a new car by a local dealer as a surprise on the Katie show

She also revealed she was hoping to dedicate her life to helping other amputees and learn from others about how much can be achieved despite their disabilities.

Aimee's university thesis will focus on wilderness therapy for amputees, which is the idea that healing can happen through nature, and victims can be helped spiritually, physically and mentally by being in their natural environment.

She said; 'When people think they cannot do certain things, it's just not true, as there is so much technology that enable people to do whatever they can.

'We say in rehabilitation "Never say can't" and I want to get that message out there to others.'

Throughout the interview, the remarkable young woman remained upbeat and was even cracking jokes about her condition with Couric, who seemed overwhelmed by her recovery.

As she described how eager she was to be able to drive again and the trials and tribulations of having to relearn the skill, Couric surprised her with a brand new car which will be equipped to deal with her disabilities.

Video footage of Aimee's recovery was shown before she walked on to the show. The sheer determination is evident on her face as she works tirelessly to improve her upper body and core strength which she said is important for her to be able to move around.

Proud: Aimee's family were there to support her and discuss the amazing journey she has been through on the Katie show

Surprise: The student was gifted a brand new car by a local car dealer who told her he just wanted her to be able to do what every other 24-year-old kid does

Goodbye: poses with hospital staff as she goes to a rehabilitation clinic. She has now spent her first night in her newly built wing of her family home

Aimee says she reminds herself every single day just how lucky she is to be alive.

'It’s something I had to do every moment of every day. It’s not something that I’m like "oh great I accomplished this", it’s something I have to get through at every moment.

'Sometimes it doesn't work, and sometimes it's bad. It’s just that fight. In everyone’s life we all have struggles we have to get through at every moment.'

Aimee
will continue her rehabilitation regime, a tough military-style workout
of 300 crunches, 400 leg lifts, and ‘untold number’ of pushups and 
‘planking’-exercises.

Wing: The team have created the perfect home for the Aimee, doing their utmost to incorporate her own bohemian, earthy and eclectic style

Aimee’s road to recovery has been followed by thousands and touched the heart of the local contractors who clubbed together to create the perfect home for Aimee.

Couric told the student that she believed she was put on this earth to do something special and looked forward to seeing what that may be.
