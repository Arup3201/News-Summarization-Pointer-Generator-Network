Disappointment: The best-selling fantasy novelist Terry Pratchett has pulled out of a convention dedicated to his books because of poor health

Novelist Terry Pratchett has been forced to withdraw from an appearance at a convention celebrating his works because of health troubles.

The top-selling author, 66, was due to meet his fans at the Ankh-Morpork Grand Exhibition - named for the city in his Discworld series of books - next month in Manchester.

In 2011 Sir Terry announced his diagnosis with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), a rare variant of Alzheimer’s disease primarily affecting vision.

His struggle with the condition - which he has dubbed his 'Embuggerance' - has now forced him to cancel his Q&A session, the first time he has had to do so.

In a statement on the event's website, he said: 'I have been putting off writing this announcement for quite some time and on good days thought I wouldn’t have to write it at all.

'However, it is with great reluctance that I have to tell you all that I will not be able to attend the upcoming Discworld Convention in Manchester.

'I am very sorry about this, but I have been dodging the effects of PCA and have been able to write for much longer than any of us ever thought possible, but now The Embuggerance is finally catching up with me, along with other age-related ailments.'

He told fans he had been looking forward to meeting them and added: 'They say time marches on, and it does, even though I have been running very fast to keep one step ahead of it.'

Pratchett, who has sold over 85million books worldwide in 37 languages, will be represented at the convention by one of his famous black hats and will also answer questions sent to him by attendees over e-mail in a video segment.

The chairman of the convention, John Hicks, said: 'While it is not going to be the same without Sir Terry, we wish him all the best. Rob Wilkins, his business manager, will be bringing The Black Hat to the Convention to represent Terry in absentia and we will, of course, welcome it with all due honours.

Imagination: Discworld, the setting of many of Sir Terry's books. The flat planet is held aloft by elephants, who in turn stand on the bag of a giant turtle that is swimming through space

'We thought it would be a humorous way of saying thank you. We'll make sure the hat has a good time.'

He added that the author has enjoyed mingling with the crowd in previous years and said: 'He loves walking around and chatting with fans.'

Sir Terry became a patron of Alzheimer’s Research UK in 2008 and donated the charity £1m.

Research shows there are hundreds of thousands of people in the UK living with dementia, and more than 40 per cent of the UK population know someone close with the disease.

I have been putting off writing this announcement for quite some time and on good days thought I wouldn’t have to write it at all. However, it is with great reluctance that I have to tell you all that I will not be able to attend the upcoming Discworld Convention in Manchester.

I am very sorry about this, but I have been dodging the effects of PCA and have been able to write for much longer than any of us ever thought possible, but now The Embuggerance is finally catching up with me, along with other age-related ailments.

I know people will have already made plans far in advance and some will be travelling a long way, but this is the first time ever that I have been unable to attend a UK convention and I really am very sorry.

They say time marches on, and it does, even though I have been running very fast to keep one step ahead of it. I really was looking forward to seeing your smiley, happy faces. Have fun everyone. Yes, on this occasion, have lots of fun.

Advocate: Terry Pratchett in front of brain imagery, taken from a programme he hosted about Alzheimer's

In recent years, author Sir Terry Pratchett, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2007, has become a vocal advocate of assisted dying being legalised and regulated in the UK - saying: 'I live in hope I can jump before I am pushed.'

In 2011 he appeared in a documentary, Choosing To Die, which showed his journey to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland to follow two British men who had decided to end their lives.

One of them, Peter Smedley, a millionaire hotelier who had motor neurone disease, later invited Pratchett and the cameras back to record his last moments.

This was the first time an actual suicide has been filmed and broadcast in the UK - and the distressing scenes provoked strong reactions.

In the documentary, he said: 'I know the time will come when words will fail me. Then, I don’t want to go on living.'

He added: 'My life, my death, my choice.'
