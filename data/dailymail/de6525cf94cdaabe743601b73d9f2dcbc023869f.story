A former National Australia Bank employee and a public servant have pleaded guilty to a $7 million insider trading scheme.

Former NAB worker Lukas James Kamay and Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) employee Christopher Russell Hill traded confidential market-sensitive information that netted about $7 million in profits.

Kamay, 26, and Hill, 24, both pleaded guilty to six charges in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Tuesday.

Kamay, 26, and Hill, 24, both pleaded guilty to six charges in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Tuesday for insider trading

Police allege that Hill, of Belconnen in the ACT, used his position with the ABS to access data on the labour force and retail trade to predict fluctuations in the Australian dollar before it was made publicly available.

He then passed it to his university friend Kamay in Melbourne, who used the information to make foreign exchange derivative trades.

Kamay and Hill are friends from Monash University and are accused of making net profit of $6.98 million over eight months between August last year and May this year by using advanced knowledge of government data.

Hill used his position as  Canberra-based ABS employee to allegedly give Kamay information about official data releases on jobs, building approvals, capital expenditure and retail sales.

Documents tendered to the court show Kamay bought an Albert Park unit featured on TV show The Block for $2.375 million.

Kamay allegedly offered Hill $50,000 to give him the ABS data and would use this information to 'predict fluctuations in the Australian dollar'.

He would buy foreign exchange derivative contracts minutes before the ABS's data release at 11.30am and would sell them shortly afterwards.

The men were arrested in May as part of a joint AFP and ASIC investigation. 

Hill worked at the NAB's foreign exchange desk

Kamay, of Clifton Hill, worked for NAB in Melbourne on the foreign exchange desk but was not involved in derivatives trading, while Hill started with the ABS in January 2011 as a technical statistics expert preparing labour force and employment reports.

After Hill was charged, The Australian Bureau of Statistics admitted it was difficult to counter the threat of a trusted insider leaking market-sensitive information.

At a Senate estimates hearing on earlier this year ABS acting statistician Jonathan Palmer defended security protocols in place, describing the breach as unprecedented in the bureau's 100-year history.

"Fortunately in this case police were clear that this person acted alone," he said.

"That gives me some level of confidence."

The bureau has recruited Belinda Gibson, former deputy chair of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, to conduct a review.

Staff must sign undertakings and declarations when they begin employment to show they are aware they risk jail if they leak sensitive information.

Mr Palmer said there were strict access controls on sensitive information and the bureau reviews access logs. 

They were granted bail to face a directions hearing in the Victorian Supreme Court on October 1.
