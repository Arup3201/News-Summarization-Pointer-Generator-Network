A new report from Gallup shows that Americans without medical insurance now make up 15.6 per cent of the population, the lowest level since 2008. But the organization hedged its bets when MailOnline asked how Medicaid enrollments might taint its conclusions.

Jenna Levy, a Gallup methodologist, wrote Monday that the number, down from a recent high of 18 per cent at the beginning of the six-month Obamacare open enrollment period, is 'a sign that the Affordable Care Act... appears to be accomplishing its goal of increasing the percentage of Americans with health insurance coverage.'

Most of the swing toward the insurance rolls, however, has been among populations that have subscribed in large numbers to Medicaid, a low-income benefit program whose costs are borne entirely by taxpayers.

Gallup editor-in-chief Frank Newport backed away from the suggestion that the numbers indicated success for President Barack Obama, telling MailOnline on Monday that Levy merely 'thought that was a reasonable assumption.'

'Really, all we're saying,' he insisted, 'is that the uninsured 
level has declined. ... We don't know how many people have paid the 
premiums, we don't know how many are on Medicaid.'

'That's why we used the word "appears".'

Gallup found that the percentage of U.S. residents without medical insurance has dipped to its lowest level since before Barack Obama took office, but hidden in the graph is a surge in Medicaid enrollments whose costs are 100 per cent bore by taxpayers

'Uninsured' statistics dipped among black Americans faster than in any other ethnic group, tracking with African-Americans' pace of Medicaid participation that far outstrips their population numbers; these women waited in Kansas city last week to sign up for Obamacare

Gallup's data show that 18.0 per cent of U.S. residents lacked medical insurance at the end of the third quarter of 2013, when Obamacare's open enrollment began. That number dropped to 15.6 per cent at the end of March.

But the trend-within-a-trend may be that the White House's 
push to move Americans into the ranks of the insured has mainly served 
to beef up a wealth transfer scheme.

A reduction from 18.0 to 15.6 per cent represents about 7 million Americans whom Gallup says became insured in the last six months.

MailOnline presented Newport with a scenario in which 1.5 million were previously uninsured private insurance customers with paid policies, and the rest were medicaid enrollees.

'Sure, absolutely,' he said, responding to a question about whether that would cause Gallup to change its mind about Obamacare's success level.

There is no deadline for joining Medicaid, which stays open for new enrollments year-round.

A MailOnline analysis showed last week that the number of paid private insurance enrollments from Americans who were previously uninsured – in contrast with those who lost their insurance after Obamacare became law and replaced it since October – may be as low as 858,000.

Among those genuine new enrollees, 
government subsidies will pay for much of the cost.

MailOnline based its calculations on a forthcoming RAND Corporation study that only the Los Angeles Times has seen in its entirety. The Times, however, published a few startling details. 

Just 23 per cent of new Obamacare enrollees had no insurance before signing up, RAND found.  And of those newly insured Americans, just 53 per cent have paid their first month's premiums.

The rest, we are left to assume, are on Medicaid.

'We all knew this would be a giant Medicaid boom,' a Department of Health and Human Services official told MailOnline Monday on condition of anonymity, because he was not authorized to speak publicly. 'It's pretty clear that the president wanted an even bigger one.'

'Whether Gallup spins this as a net gain on insured-versus-uninsured numbers is up to them,' the official continued, 'but they're really comparing apples to oranges unless they separate insurance buyers from people who have it handed to them' [through Medicaid].

Gloating for now: President Barack Obama boasted about signing up 7.1 million Americans for Affordable Care Act insurance coverage, but he didn't say how many had paid their premiums or how many already were insured before his signature law took effect -- and he glossed ove3r the Medicaid enrollment figures

The Gallup report, published online Monday morning, acknowledged that '[t]he uninsured 
rate for lower-income Americans dropped 3.2 points to 27.5% – the 
largest decline within any key subgroup – while the uninsured rate for 
blacks fell 3.3 points to 17.6%.'

Low-income U.S. residents are by definition the core constituency of Medicaid.

Padding the numbers: Under Obamacare, Americans earning up to 138 per cent of the federal government's poverty-line income can choose free Medicaid coverage

And the Kaiser Family Foundation
 has reported that through the year 2012, blacks comprised 20 per cent 
of Medicaid benefit recipients. The 2010 U.S. Census found that just 
12.6 per cent of the U.S. population is African-American.

Gallup mentioned Medicaid only in the final paragraph of its report – hundreds of words after declaring that the Obamacare system 'appears' to be succeeding.

'Medicaid has likely added millions to its enrollment due to its expansion,' Gallup says, 'although – as with the exchanges themselves – it remains unclear how many were previously insured and moved to Medicaid as a less expensive option.'

'Regardless, the decline in the percentage of uninsured over the course of the first quarter almost certainly includes the effects of expanded Medicaid eligibility policies.'

Gallup also notes that it is 'likely ... that not all new enrollees will ultimately pay their insurance premiums, which would result in a subsequent change in status from insured to uninsured at some point later in 2014.'

Newport told MailOnline that Gallup will convene a group of journalists on April 16 to 'look at some internal data that we'll be able to analyze by that point.'

Those data, he said, may be able to suggest a story behind the sudden drop in the number of uninsured Americans.

'At the moment, this is what we have,' he said, pointing to Monday morning's report. 'If new data come along that suggest something more, then we'll report it.'

The Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether 'uninsured' percentages will rebound upward as some enrollees fail to pay, and others replace paid insurance with Medicaid after receiving cancellation notices.

A Gallup writer had claimed that shrinking numbers of 'uninsured' Americans was proof Obamacare is 'accomplishing its goal'

@highlight

But the organization's top editor backed off that claim, agreeing that the number could rocket back up as people fail to pay premiums, and signups for taxpayer-funded Medicaid 'insurance' are factored in

@highlight

An HHS official confided that Gallup is comparing apples and oranges unless it separates Medicaid consumers from Americans with private insurance

@highlight

Gallup's eidtor-in-chief conceded that his organization's conclusions would have to change, if few paying Obamacare subscribers materialize who were uninsured before the law took effect

@highlight

A MailOnline analysis based on forthcoming RAND Corporation numbers showed last week that as few as 858,000 people could fit that description
