It's every Twilight fan's dream come true.

A university is offering students the opportunity to study for a degree in Gothic studies.

A new centre at Manchester Metropolitan University will focus on teaching classic spine-chilling literature - but will also cash in on the popularity of modern-day TV shows and vampire flicks such as Twilight.

Lecturers say the subject is no longer a niche topic for horror fans and goths, but has entered the mainstream.

And Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series - not to mention the acting of Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart - is thought to have played a big part in the genre's recent surge in popularity.

The new Manchester Centre for Gothic Studies will also look at the influence of Gothic architecture and art in Victorian times as well as contemporary goth bands and online culture.

Literature expert Linnie Blake, who will head up the centre, said the haunting stories often explored taboo topics such as sex or illness.

She said: ‘The public interest in the Gothic has never been greater.

‘Books, films, television, video games and graphic novels all illustrate this.

‘But the Gothic isn’t simply a popular mode of entertainment. It is a powerful form of storytelling that tells us something about our deepest and darkest fears, about who we are as people and how our society works.’

The centre will be formally launched during the city’s first ever Gothic Manchester Festival, which runs from October 21 to 27.

It will also be home to two courses on Gothic studies as well as an academic magazine, Dark Arts.

Dr Blake said: ‘MMU is extremely unusual in having a large proportion of academics working on the Gothic, not just in English but in art and design and science and engineering

‘The Manchester Centre for Gothic Studies will capitalise on this outstanding expertise to enable those who love the Gothic to think about it more deeply and those that don’t to think again.

‘To us, studying the Gothic is an intellectual adventure on the dark side and we want to share this not only with other academics but also with members of the wider world.’

Manchester Metropolitan isn't the only university seeking to capitalise on the recent resurgence of Gothic literature.

Dr Serena Trowbridge has revealed her plans to launch an undergraduate module on Gothic literature from next year at Birmingham City University.

A purist, she has contended that Twilight series does not constitute Gothic literature in the conventional sense, but said that the popular series would be touched on in her course.

The module is also likely to feature discussions on books such as Harry Potter and A Series of Unfortunate Events, which Dr Trowbridge claims are better examples of Gothic fiction.

Despite her reservations, the expert has admitted that the Twilight series has played a significant role getting people interested in other Gothic books.

'There's certainly a growing interest in Gothic literature,' she told Mail Online.

'And I suppose the people coming to our universities now have read the Twilight books now.

'I don't think Twilight is Gothic at all - the Gothic novel up until the mid 20th century certainly tended to be historical.

'But my view is that people reading anything is good news.'

She added: 'I have read the Twilight series and know that they have appealed to a lot of people - and not just teenagers.

'It has certainly sparked a rise of interest... and there have been a lot of new books recently that are loosely Gothic.'
