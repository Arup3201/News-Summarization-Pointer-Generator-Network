After experiencing the devastating pain of losing a child, this gorilla mother is once again full of the joys of parenthood.

These heartwarming images were captured by freelance photographer and musician Marina Cano at the Cabarceno Natural Park in Cantabria, Spain.

The mother, Chelewa, lost her baby daughter last year after crushing her in a tragic accident.

Ms Cano, who also took photos of Chelewa with her first child, captured the tender moments from only feet away.

Chelewa became a parent for the first time last year, but the baby died 11 days later after the new mother apparently moved too quickly and broke two of her ribs.

While her mother tips the scales at 11 and a half stone, the baby weighed just under five pounds.

Cabarceno is the largest park in Europe, covering over 750 hectares.

Gorillas live in semi-wild conditions in natural, open space.Â
