The New York bakery world famous for its cronut pastry that was knocked out of business temporarily last week after a health inspection found mouse droppings reopened Tuesday at 8a with a long line of customers waiting outside.

But the Dominque Ansel Bakery on Spring Street is fighting hard to restore its reputation — and what it considers unfair criticism due to its success — by introducing a 'Rocky' cronut.

A photo posted on Instagram shows the donut inspired by the famous series of movies about boxer Rocky Balboa, who was played by Sylvester Stallone. It shows a cronut with dark chocolate frosting on top and a yellow golden star.

The Dominique Ansel Bakery in Manhattan reopened Tuesday and to honor its comeback made a special 'Rocky' cronut just for the occasion

The cronut, which was only available today to mark the reopening, was made 'as a symbol of our dedication and resilience,' according to a bakery news release.

The photo also shows a card net to the cronuts with a famous series of lines from the 2006 movie Rocky Balboa, the sixth movie in the 'Rocky' franchise and said by the title character.

'Let me tell you something you already know: The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows....You,me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward; how much you can take and keep moving forward,' the card reads in part.

Dominique Ansel also said it has taken steps to make sure the 'severe mouse infestation' found last week by the New York City Department of Health will not happen again.

'We are deeply sorry for any disappointment that we may have caused you,' the bakery said in a statement, according to gothamist.com. 'Taking this opportunity, we have completely fortified our facilities with a full reconstruction and re-cementing, taking every issue seriously in an effort to provide an even more pristine environment for our guests. As you know, we cook in completely opened kitchens, so everything we do is in full view.'

However, the bakery also said it was facing 'malicious attacks' due to its success.

'Looking forward, our hope is that honest, hard-working businesses should not have to face cruel and sensationalized attacks that are not framed in the proper context,' the statement continued. 'And systems should not be abused to single-out any one business over another. We urge our customers to seek deeper details and answers before jumping to conclusions.

'And regardless of the hits, we will take every chance and criticism as a lesson learned and work harder to rise to the expectations you have of us and that we have of ourselves.'

A mouse is seen scurrying on the floor of the Dominique Ansel Bakery in a YouTube video posted last week

Cronut cravers gathered around Domique Ansel Bakery, only to find out they had been shut down by the health department

When the bakery opened at 8a this morning, there was already a huge line of customers, apparently unfazed by the DOH inspection.

'The mice don’t really cause me concern,' Jay Randolph, 41, who began waiting outside the bakery at 6a told the New York Post. 'If you’re in New York City, it’s hard to avoid a mouse popping up now and then. It’s New York. If you can’t handle some mice, your metabolism is not ready for the big city.'

'The mice run this city,' Lester Sykes, 26, also told the paper. 'The only places that say they don’t have them are just the ones where the inspectors haven’t seen them yet.'

The health department responded to Dominique Ansel after
 a customer posted a video online April 3 showing a mouse scampering 
around the bakery floor.

YouTube user Cody Pickrodt shot the video at Dominique Ansel, telling Gothamist: 'I
 pointed it out to a couple waiting in line behind me. They didn't 
believe it until I showed them the video. Then they had to leave.

'I didn't mention it to employees. It appeared they were all aware of it.

'This
 was the tail end of the little guy's adventure. He ran all over the 
place in plain view for a good 20 seconds before I got my phone out,' Mr Pickrodt said.

After
 the video was posted online, workers at the bakery spent seven hours in
 a deep clean and a spokesman told MailOnline that not a single mouse was found.

But
 a health department spokesman had a very different story tell after 
shutting the establishment down for a 'severe' pest infestation.

'What
 made the infestation severe was that the health inspector found several
 hundred mouse droppings,' a DOH spokesman told Gothamist.
