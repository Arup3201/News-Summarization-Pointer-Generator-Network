Manchester United and Liverpool will both be televised live in the fifth round of the FA Cup, providing they come through their fourth round replays.

Louis van Gaal's side face Cambridge United next Tuesday at Old Trafford while Liverpool travel to Bolton a day later for their replay.

And both clubs will have the added incentive of another live television game if they progress to the fifth round.
