Apple has unveiled a radical overhaul of its Mac software alongside a brand new iOS 8.

The latest iOS software now 
has interactive notifications, a keyboard that predicts what users will 
type, and a Snapchat-style self-destruct button for video and audio 
messages.

Meanwhile, the new Mac software design has taken many of the concepts seen on last year's 'flat' iOS 7, and added key features such as being able to search Wikipedia and the web directly from the home screen.

Earlier this month, Google's rival Apple unveiled a radical overhaul of its Mac software alongside a brand new iOS 8. Apple's senior vice president of Software Engineering also revealed the much-rumoured Health app (pictured) that syncs with fitness trackers

iOS 8 now has a new notification system, meaning people can respond without having to open and switch apps.

A new video messaging system lets people easily send video and audio messages, and these messages can be set to self destruct, rather like Snapchat.

The iPhone’s keyboard has been 
overhauled with a new QuickType system that can predict words the user 
is likely to use, and learns how a user types over time.

Spotlight has been improved to allow better searching.

Messages has been 
updated it to make it easier to set up and take part in group chats.

The
 much-rumoured Health app brings together data from fitness tracking bands and other systems. 

The family sharing app allows families to easily share calenders, pictures and even find phones.

Parents can see what their children have bought online, and download apps, music and films on the same account.

The system will automatically message parents if their child tries to buy content online.

Apple boss Tim Cook said the firm’s software had been completely redesigned to work ‘seamlessly’ together.

iOS 8's new notification system means people can respond without having to open and switch apps.

There is also a new video messaging system allowing people to easily send video and audio messages.

This allows messages to be set to self destruct, rather like Snapchat.

Spotlight has also been improved to allow better searching.

According
 to Cook, Messages is the most frequently used app, and this has been 
updated it to make it easier to set up and take part in group chats.

The
 much-rumoured Health app was also revealed, following weeks of leaks. 
It brings together data from fitness tracking bands and other systems.

‘Developers have created a vast array of healthcare devices,’ said Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of Software Engineering. ‘But until now, the information lives in silos.’

On Yosemite (pictured left), Federighi said users can now search Wikipedia and the web directly from the home screen. The iOS 8 software (pictured right) now has a new notification system, meaning people can respond without having to switch apps. There is also a Snapchat-style self-destruct button for video messages

The changes were announced during Apple's annual Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in San Francisco. They are part of a host of updates to the firm's iOS 8 and Mac OS X software, (pictured) unveiled by Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of Software Engineering, during a keynote speech yesterday

The
 software has been redesigned to look ‘flat’- to resemble the latest 
version of the iOS software seen on iPhones and iPads - in a project 
overseen by chief designer Sir Jonathan Ive.

It
 also has a new mode that lets users easily change the colour scheme, 
and comes with a new online storage service called iCloud Drive, 
allowing users to automatically synchronise files across multiple Macs, 
iPhones, iPads and even Windows PCs.

The
 software update will improve battery life, according to Federighi, and 
it has added a new ‘markup’ option to let users easily annotate pictures
 they are emailing.

The firm has also improved the way Macs, iPads and iPhone work together.

For example, a new feature called Continuity lets people drop files onto their phone from a Mac, while Handoff lets people swap between devices and automatically pick up where the user left off - even if an email is half written.

Elsewhere, Yosemite now has SMS and phone call support to Macs, meaning people can send texts from their Mac, and even use it as a speakerphone. 

Apple is working with the Mayo Clinic to allow data to be shared with doctors automatically, and notify them if a reading is too high, for example.

Apple's iOS 8 additionally now has a family sharing app allowing families to easily share calenders, pictures and even find phones.

Parents can see what their children have bought online, and download apps, music and films on the same account.

The system will automatically message parents if their child tries to buy content online, too.

Elsehwere, the firm added HomeKit, a system to allow users to control home appliances and turn their iPhone into a remote control.

It allows the iPhone to open doors, control lights and even carry out commands like ‘get ready for bed’ which could dim lights and lock all doors.

During the Mac OS announcement, 
Federighi joked that OS X Weed was one of the names considered, before 
revealing the latest version of the software will be called Yosemite.

‘It’s got an all new interface,’ Federighi boasted. ‘It’s gorgeous and more usable.’

Apple's Federighi (pictured) unveiled the radical overhaul of Apple's Mac software, called Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite earlier this year. The firm is making it available to users tomorrow in a special 'preview' version

For
 example, a feature called Continuity lets people drop files onto 
their phone from a Mac, while Handoff lets people swap between devices 
and automatically pick up where the user left off - even if an email is 
half written.

Elsewhere, 
Yosemite now has SMS and phone call support to Macs, meaning people can 
send texts from their Mac, and even use it as a speakerphone.

Users
 can dial their iPhone from their Mac, a feature that was demonstrated 
by calling Dr Dre, Apple’s latest employee. ‘What time should I get into
 work? I can’t wait to start,’ he said.

The new Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite software will be available in the Autumn, and will be free.

The
 Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) is an annual event in which the 
company reveals a series of new products and software to developers.

Recently, the event has focused predominantly on Apple software, including iOS on the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, and OS X for its range of Macs.

Major hardware releases are reserved until Apple's annual event in September.

Speaking to 5,000 developers at the California's Moscone centre, Cook said: 'We’re here to celebrate the developer community, and the number of lives they have enriched.

‘Our youngest developer is 13, and we’ll be seeing apps from him for a long time.

'We’re gathered to talk about Mac OS and iOS. While the industry declined by 5 per cent, Macs grew by 12 per cent.'

Cook also took aim at Microsoft’s poorly received Windows 8 software.

'Over 50 per cent of our users are on the latest release. Windows 8 shipped a year before Mavericks, and it’s at 14 per cent.

Earlier this year, Cook announced Apple is gearing up to 'enter new product categories'.

While
 the recent $3billion acquisition of Beats Audio from rapper Dr Dre 
suggests the company is potentially exploring new territories.

At last year's event, Apple's senior vice president of Software Engineering, Craig Federighi unveiled iOS 7 - which was seen as a major step away from previous versions of the mobile software.

It was the first major change to the operating system since senior vice president of design at Apple, Sir Jonathan Ive, was put in charge of software in October 2013.

It was a complete redesign, and many critics said it was too similar to Google's rival Android system. 

Elsewhere,
 Apple is said to be looking to launch a Smart Home platform that would 
let iOS devices control connected household appliances.

Google
 has also made inroads into the smart home with the Nest Labs purchase, 
and this could be the next key battleground the two companies will be 
fighting over.
