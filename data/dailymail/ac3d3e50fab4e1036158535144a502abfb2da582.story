It's destination Real Madrid for Toni Kroos as the Germany midfielder admitted he is to leave Bayern Munich in the immediate aftermath of clinching the World Cup. 

The 24-year-old was instrumental for Joachim Low's side in Brazil, even with talk surrounding his future in Munich being rife throughout the tournament.

And, when celebrating the 1-0 win against Argentina on Sunday night, Kroos confirmed he would be linking up with the La Liga giants in a 'dream' move.

'We’ve finished the World Cup in the best way possible. Now I’m going to Madrid, so that’s two dreams achieved,' Kroos told UOL.

The central midfielder is set to be paid £160,000-a-week at the Bernabeu as Bayern appeared to finally cave and allow him to leave the club for around £20million.

Kroos has agreed a five-year deal with Carlo Ancelotti's Champions League winners.

Despite being widely talked about as one of the best in Europe in recent years his attitude has been criticised by senior figures at the Allianz Arena - Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and fellow directors raising questions about the decision not to take a penalty in the European final against Chelsea two years ago.

Formerly a target of Manchester United, Kroos has shown in the last few weeks exactly why David Moyes earmarked him as the club's major signing in the summer rebuilding process had he kept his job at Old Trafford.

He has been a standout performer for the eventual victors, scoring twice in the semi-final humiliation of Brazil, and kept the Germans ticking over in midfield - things to raise further eyebrows over Louis van Gaal's decision to pull the plug on any deal.
