Kyle Keen was 16 months old when he suffered severe brain haemorrhaging after being shaken by Tyrone Matthews

A baby who was shaken to death by his violent stepfather could still be alive today if it wasn't for a host of 'catastrophic mistakes' at a hospital, an independent report has found.

Kyle Keen was 16 months old when he suffered severe brain haemorrhaging after being shaken by Tyrone Matthews.

The 32-year-old from Walsall was jailed for six-and-a-half year in December 2007 after he pleaded guilty to manslaughter at Wolverhampton Crown Court.

The baby's mother Kerry McIntosh, then aged 21, also from Walsall, admitted cruelty by neglect and was given a six-month suspended prison term.

But an independent report ruled that there was a 'significant probability' the little boy would not have died if an intervention had taken place.

Now Kyle's biological father Robert, 31, has 
said he hoped lessons had been learned as his son would 'probably still 
be alive' if cared for properly by health professionals.

Just a week before his death, the report said that staff at Walsall Manor Hospital noticed bruising on Kyle's arms a week before his death but failed to act.

Junior doctors and nurses who examined the toddler also believed he was being abused but a consultant paediatrician stopped them from alerting police and social workers, it said.

The report listed a catalogue of errors by medics who treated him leading up to his death on June 30, 2006.

They included 'serious errors of judgement' that may have led directly to further injury to Kyle after his admission on June 21.

It also found that the staff who raised concerns should have pursued those further, even though a senior colleague disagreed, that record keeping at the time was poor, inadequate and contained numerous omissions, and that the trust did not take 'appropriate action' at the time to investigate thoroughly.

The little died following his transfer from Walsall to the paediatric intensive care unit in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, when a bleed on the brain was diagnosed.

He had been admitted a few days previously on June 21, 2006, where bruises were noted but no follow-up action was taken and he was discharged.

He was then admitted to the hospital again on June 29 with a brain injury and died a day later.

Dr David Drew was the head of the paediatric department at Manor Hospital at the time.

He later acted as a whistleblower in the case and said he had tried to raise concerns over his death and a member of staff in the department.

Yesterday he said a number of medical staff had told a consultant who had seen Kyle that the case needed to be referred to social services.

But an independent report ruled that there was a 'significant probability' the little boy would not have died if an intervention had taken place. Now  Kyle's biological father Robert, 31, has said he hoped lessons had been learned as his son would 'probably still be alive' if cared for properly by health professionals

He said: 'From day one it was quite clear an opportunity had been missed the previous week and this little boy had suspicious, unexplained bruising.

'I have no doubt that if Kyle had been referred to social services he would have survived.'

Mr Keen said he hoped the hospital had learned lessons.

He said: 'In 2012 I learned from a senior doctor who had helped look after Kyle in his final hours that he died following 'catastrophic mistakes' in basic safeguarding at Manor Hospital.

'The hospital did not tell me anything about this.

'I have learned from the report that if the hospital had cared for Kyle properly he would probably still be alive.

'I understand from the report that Kyle was sent home where he met his death by a doctor against the advice of medical and nursing colleagues and against the child protection policy.

'It is impossible for me to say how this makes me feel. It is all made worse by the fact that this has been kept from us for eight long years.

'He should have been referred to social services. This would probably have saved his life.

'The report is also clear that Kyle's death was not investigated properly at the time or subsequently.

'It is good to learn the truth at last. But the report leaves many questions in my mind unanswered.

Just a week before his death, the report said that staff at Walsall Manor Hospital noticed bruising on Kyle's arms a week before his death but failed to act. Junior doctors and nurses who examined the toddler also believed he was being abused but a consultant paediatrician stopped them from alerting police and social workers, it said

'The review has been unable to find out why I was not involved in the investigations into Kyle's death.

'Nor why neither the hospital nor safeguarding board contacted me to tell me of their findings.

'I hope that Manor Hospital will learn the lessons from this latest investigation and that no other family will lose a child because of such serious mistakes.

'But if that does happen I hope the hospital will immediately put its hands up and admit it got it wrong.

'Covering things up for years only makes things worse.'

Mr Keen made a formal complaint about the inadequate care the youngster received and chief executive Richard Kirby agreed to commission the review, which was carried out by consultants Cordis Bright.

The hospital have now apologised and insisted improvements have been made, including how it works with other agencies.

Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust said there were now new processes for ensuring that the information for a child is available in the medical records in the event of the same youngster being admitted.

Richard Kirby, the trust's chief executive said: 'We recognise that an apology alone is not sufficient and I hope that we have been able to demonstrate to Mr Keen our commitment to act on what we have learnt from this review.'
