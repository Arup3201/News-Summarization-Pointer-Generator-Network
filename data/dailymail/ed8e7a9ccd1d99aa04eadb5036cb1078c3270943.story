Almost as if it were ripped straight from a science fiction film, the trick footage seen in the video below makes it appear as if a man is walking on water.

Shot by biologist Armiche Ramos and brothers Armando and Francisco del Rosario, the filmmakers utilise their experience in free diving to trick viewers.

The team relied solely on their own skill, and a few hidden secrets - with no computers graphics involved in the production of the video.

The trio, known as the Ocean Brothers, created the video for underwater photography competition World Shoot Out - where it won the prize for best short film.

‘We didn’t use any special effects, just camera tricks and weights which were hidden inside the wetsuits,’ biologist filmmaker Armiche Ramos said.

‘People who watch it usually don’t know what’s happening, they think that the images are made by computer.’ he said.

Despite the amazing footage, no special effects were used to create the award-winning short film

Putting their experience to work: The men utilised their experience free-diving to create the film, reminiscent of a science-fiction film

Shot over three years in El Hierro, the smallest of the Canary Islands, the filming was forced to be postponed for a year due to an active underwater volcano in the region.

‘The location is not always calm and we had to wait for the correct moment for several months at a time,’ Mr Ramos said.
