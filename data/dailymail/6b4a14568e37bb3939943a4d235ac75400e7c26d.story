As the tallest nation in Europe, Germany has always had a size advantage, but it appears that men there may be lacking in other areas.

One in five penis enlargement surgeries worldwide take place in Germany, according to data released by the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons.

The research found that of an estimated 15,414 penile enlargements that took place in 2013, 2,786 - almost 20 per cent - took place in Germany.

Venuzuela nabbed second prize in the penis-enlargement race, but its 473 operations pale into insignificance beside Germany's tally, which is over five times greater.

Spain came in a close third, with 471 enlargement surgeries performed, with another big drop before  Mexico, who came in fourth with 295.

According to The German Centre for Urology and Phalloplasty, which performs around 6,000 operations a year, penile enlargement surgery leaves the recipient with an extra three to six centimetres in length.

Surgery can also give the patient an increased two to three centimetres in girth.

Men can also choose to have their glans penis - otherwise known as the tip - made 30 to 50 per cent larger.  

But recipients don't need to worry that their secret will be discovered in the bedroom, as no visible scar being left by the deft surgeons' handiwork.

However, the price of penile perfection is high, with the 'low-risk' operation costing 9,600 euros (around £7,627)

The centre also offers penile implants and reconstructive surgery for congenital curving.
