A cuddly monkey with a taste for adventure is a real Curious George - after travelling around the world for more than five years with his owner.

From Sydney to Singapore and London to Tennessee, the cuddly companion has visited some of the world’s most famous tourist attractions.

He has been snapped hanging out at the Sydney Harbour Bridge, drinking beer in Germany, posing on the River Thames and in Tokyo’s cat cafes.

Miss
 Lin, originally from Telford, Shropshire, but now living in Los 
Angeles, said: ‘It began as something for fun for me - to take 
interesting photos.

‘I do a 
lot of travelling so it was just an idea to help pass the time one day 
and it just grew from there every time I went somewhere I’d bring George
 too.

‘He gets taken 
everywhere I go now - some friends have even asked if they can take him 
on holiday with them too he has become such a celebrity.'

'And
 the most unusual was definitely the cat cafe in Japan where the owner 
has loads of cats and you can have tea and play with them.

‘Apartments
 are very small there so people can’t have pets - this is the best 
alternative for people. The cats were really interested in George.

‘We
 don’t have any big trips planned for the rest of the year but we will 
be heading to New York and Portland in the next few months.’

The monkey is fond of travel and prone to mischief, but always narrowly escapes disaster. First published in 1941, the books have sold 25million copies.

They have also more recently spawned two TV series in 1980 and 2006, five films since 2006, and a video game for multiple platforms.
