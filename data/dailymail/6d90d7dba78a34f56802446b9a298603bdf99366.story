As more of her belongings were removed today, his were delivered - and it was the most obvious sign yet that the 
TV chef’s marriage split from the art collector may be permanent.

When Nigella Lawson moved out, her husband Charles Saatchi had played down photographs of him grabbing her by the throat and tweaking her nose at a restaurant as a ‘playful tiff’.

But she appears to have dashed any hopes he may have that the marriage of the couple - who have a £14million marital home in Chelsea, west London - can be reconciled.

In and out: The arrival of the removal teams at the £14million marital home in Chelsea was the clearest sign yet that the TV chef’s marriage split may be permanent

For the second day today there was a van outside their home, sent
to take away not just her clothes but also her precious cookery 
utensils and recipe books – everything, it seems, but the kitchen sink.

They appeared in the middle of the afternoon yesterday, evidently while Saatchi was out.

Under the direction of Miss Lawson’s 
sister Horatia, they trooped in and out of the house removing box after 
box, including ones labelled ‘cookbooks’ and ‘kitchen’ as well as a food
processor, clothes and paintings.

Other items including Miss Lawson’s 
weights and exercise ball, dresses, hats, toys, toiletries and even a 
bag of wrapping paper were loaded into the van.

One box contained a can labelled 
Cannabis – which despite the alarming name is a legal energy drink 
containing hemp extract.

Miss Lawson was not seen and Saatchi turned up 
only after the process was complete. There were so many possessions that
the removal team made two runs.

One onlooker said he had been told that some statues had been removed earlier in the day.

‘It looked very much like Nigella is moving all of her personal possessions out of the house – and isn’t going to be back in a hurry,’ he said.

Many
items were apparently taken to a storage facility while the rest were 
taken to an address some seven miles away in south-west London where 
Miss Lawson appears to be setting up home.

She was spotted yesterday with Bruno, 
her 17-year-old son from her first marriage, before heading back to the 
£10,000-a-week Mayfair flat where she has been staying.

The
53-year-old has been seen there several times looking drawn and without
her wedding ring, and while her two children and sister have visited, 
there has been no sign of her husband of ten years.

Saatchi, 70, has accepted a police caution for assault for the scenes that provoked their split, despite playing it down.

The
advertising tycoon turned modern art mogul was photographed grabbing 
Miss Lawson by the throat and tweaking her nose outside Scotts 
restaurant in central London during an extraordinary 27-minute incident 
three Sundays ago.

When
Miss Lawson left home after the photos were published a week later, 
Saatchi claimed he had simply suggested she moved out to wait for ‘the 
dust to settle’.

He initially tried to explain the throat-grabbing as a ‘playful tiff’.

When further pictures of him twisting Miss Lawson’s nose emerged, he said he had merely been trying to clean her nose.

Miss Lawson’s spokesman last night continued to refuse to comment either on the assault incident or on the state of her marriage.

But moving her belongings to a different house would appear to signal the start of a divorce between the millionaire celebrity chef and Saatchi, who is said to have a fortune of up to £100million.
