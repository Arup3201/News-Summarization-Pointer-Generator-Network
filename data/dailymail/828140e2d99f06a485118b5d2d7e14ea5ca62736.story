Neighbours have spoken of their terror after a runaway horse and cart bolted down a quiet street leaving a trail of destruction and causing thousands of pounds worth of damage.

The horse smashed the cart into five cars, severed a broadband cable and phone line and narrowly missed a woman putting her bins out as it charged through Cheadle Hulme near Stockport.

Residents heard the commotion at around 8.30pm on Tuesday with the bizarre incident being caught on CCTV.

Mess: A runaway horse and cart bolted down a quiet residential street leaving a trail of destruction and causing thousands of pounds worth of damage. This image captured on CCTV shows the horse and cart

The footage shows the horse-and-cart racing down the street before smashing into a car. A man can be seen chasing the horse before it goes out of view.

A Fiat, Nissan and VW Polo were all damaged - with broken wing mirrors, smashed headlights, dents and scratches. 

A Toyota Aygo owned by Steven Allan's partner was also badly damaged, suffering a smashed rear window.

The 35-year-old IT specialist said: ''I heard a commotion, a massive bang and jumped up and looked out of the window and saw the horse go past the car and the cart bounce on the roof.

'I wasn’t best pleased. We only bought the car last week and now it might be a write-off.

'There was a girl putting her bins out a few doors down and she just stepped back as the horse came clattering past - she could have been killed.

'It was close to cutting through the gas pipe.

'It damaged five cars, a lamp-post, the pavement and cut through a internet and phone line.'

He added: 'I have contacted the insurance company but at the moment we have no one to claim against.

'I am a bit overwhelmed. I can’t believe it has happened and hope it is a one-off. Horse and carts should not be allowed on the public highway unless they have full insurance.'

Neighbour Jim Collinson, 66, said pony and carts were often seen travelling on the road and horses were kept on fields behind the houses.

It is believed the driver had stopped his cart further down the road when the horse was spooked by a noise and galloped off.

Police are hunting for the owner of the horse and cart.
