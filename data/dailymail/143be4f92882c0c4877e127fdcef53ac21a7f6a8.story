Council budgets are more difficult to read than some of the most historically complex books ever written

They are some of the most mentally challenging works ever committed to paper.

But for those of you who find Isaac Newton’s Principia and Thomas Hobbes’s Leviathan a tad too easy, here is some required reading – your local council’s annual budget report.

Analysis of local authority documents has found that trying to get your head around your a council’s expenditure can be a much harder task than understanding the laws of gravity.

Texts that have puzzled students and caused them untold exam woe for centuries were compared against local authorities’ most recent budgets.

It found that some councils’ spending reviews are much harder to get to grips with than weighty texts like Georg Hegel’s The Phenomenology of Spirit and Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time.

The report used a series of tests to decipher how many years in education a reader required to fully understand council budgets, measured against classic works of literature, science and philosophy.

It found that Newton’s Principia, the scientist’s three-volume tome that detailed the laws of motion and gravitation, required 17.1 years of education.

Leviathan, another classic work penned by English philosopher Thomas Hobbes, was a slightly easier read, requiring just 14.7 years in education.

But the analysis drew up staggering comparisons with local authorities.

It revealed that understanding Kensington and Chelsea’s annual budget required 20.5 years of education, while Redcar and Cleveland’s needed 22.5 years.

Transparency campaigners yesterday called for councils to stop using ‘ludicrously difficult’ language in their publications so taxpayers can decipher what funds are being spent on.

The study used a variety of algorithms looking at aspects such as average sentence length and the average number of syllables in a word to come up with a difficulty grading.

It used excerpts from over 40 council’s most recent budgets, mostly taken from the introductory passages.

Councils scored an average of 12.6 years in education, which is still harder to take in than Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time, which scored 11.6 years.

Even Isaac Newton's Principia - a three volume tome published in 1687 detailing the laws of gravity - was easier to read than Chelsea and Kensington council's budget report, researchers found

Solihull Council’s annual report was another of those that proved difficult to comprehend, requiring 16.9 years.

This was gauged even more troublesome than the first chapter of Georg Hegel’s The Phenomolgy of Spirit, according to the Trinity Mirror research.

Andy Silvester, spokesman for the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘How can taxpayers scrutinise Council decisions properly when those decisions are explained in such a complex way?

‘Too many of these documents are ludicrously difficult to understand.

‘Every council must strive to be as transparent as possible, and that means writing in language that everybody can get their head round.’

A Brief History of Time, by Professor Stephen Hawking (left), was easier to read than the average council budget report. It required 11.6 years of education, compared to the average council report that needed 12.6

Redcar and Cleveland council, whose budget was the most complex to understand, said it is ‘not easy’ for council’s to present their spending figures in an easily digestible form.

Councillor Norman Pickthall, cabinet member for corporate resources, said: ‘Clearly any reports which meet the statutory duties placed on us as a council are unlikely to be simple or straightforward reading.

‘We are constantly looking at ways to refine the way we present complicated financial data to our cabinet members, councillors and the public.

‘We always do our best to put things as clearly as possible and will continue to look at ways we can make our budget reporting less complicated in the future.’
