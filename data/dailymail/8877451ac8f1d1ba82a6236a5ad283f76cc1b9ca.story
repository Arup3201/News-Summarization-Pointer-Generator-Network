Under scrutiny: Baroness Vadera prepared a paper with former colleagues at the bank UBS headed 'Reducing Libor'

Leaked documents last night brought the interest-rate fixing scandal that has shaken Britain's banks closer to the heart of the last Labour government.

They suggest that Baroness Vadera, a former Cabinet Office minister and one of Labour's chief economic advisers, told officials in 2008 that bringing down the rates which determine how much banks lend to each other would be 'a major contribution to the stability of the banking system and to the health of the economy'.

A paper prepared by the peer with former colleagues at the bank UBS was headed 'Reducing Libor' – the name for the inter-bank lending rate at the centre of the scandal.

The document was circulated among officials and Lady Vadera's ministerial colleagues at the height of the credit crunch in 2008 and concludes: 'Getting Libor down is desirable.'

But the briefing note was prepared only days after Barclays boss Bob Diamond, who is fighting to save his job after traders at the bank were revealed to have made millions by fixing the rate, discussed the issue with Bank of England deputy governor Paul Tucker.

On another dramatic day in the unfolding scandal:

Denial: The Bank of England has been forced to deny it was aware that bankers were manipulating the rate

The Bank of England has been forced to deny it was aware that bankers were manipulating the rate, which affects how much customers pay for mortgages and credit cards.

Barclays traders are said to have 'mistakenly' believed they were operating under instruction from the Bank when they fiddled the figures.

Lady Vadera said last night there had been widespread concern, including in government, about Libor figures but insisted that was 'very different' to issues of alleged market manipulation.

What discussions bank bosses had with officials from the Bank, and senior figures in government, over Libor will form a central part of a Senate-style inquiry announced last night by David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne.

Labour leader Ed Miliband has insisted that only a full-scale public inquiry led by a senior judge will do, and is considering refusing to co-operate with the Parliamentary probe.

Mr Miliband said politicians investigating bankers would not command the confidence of the British people. Lady Vadera's leaked note, from November 2008, suggests concern about reducing the rate was shared by senior figures in the Labour government, and specifically mentions the high rates being posted by Barclays, RBS and HBOS.

The peer and her co-authors say the price of credit in the real economy is 'heavily Libor influenced' and that bringing the rate down was critical to 'rebuilding the health of a banking system'.

Libor is the average cost of borrowing for banks, calculated every day using submissions from a number of selected banks. It is used to price huge numbers of loans and financial products across the world.

Lady Vadera's note discusses reducing the fees on government lending schemes to banks as a way of trying to cut their borrowing costs, and there is no suggestion the peer was aware that traders went on to fiddle the rate.  

But the document adds to growing evidence of concern about keeping Libor low among the authorities of the day. The Parliamentary inquiry is likely to focus on how and whether that concern was communicated to bank bosses, and how they responded.

Conservative MP Jesse Norman, a member of the Treasury select committee, said: 'This document appears to show that senior figures in the last government were highly concerned about ways of reducing Libor at the height of the financial crisis. The question is whether and how that was passed on to the banks.

'That issue, and the relationship between the Bank of England and Barclays, will need to be looked at closely by the Parliamentary inquiry.'

Mr Osborne, in a Commons clash with Labour's Ed Balls, whose former ministerial duties included regulating the City, asked: 'Did he express any concerns about the Libor rate when Gordon Brown was Prime Minister? We will find out in due course.'

Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom, a former banker, said the revelations about Libor were likely to be the tip of the iceberg. She said: 'You know, if Libor has been manipulated, and abused, and lied about, what other potential areas of the inter-bank markets have been rigged?

'Gilt auctions, for example, other liquidity schemes that the Bank of England's put in place. I certainly think that all banks and regulators need to be considering what scope there is for fraud to have been committed.

'I must admit, as a former banker and having kind of made the case for the industry over a while, I was pretty shocked at this new low.'

A spokesman for Lady Vadera said: 'Like everyone else, government was very concerned about the price of credit to small and medium-sized enterprises despite record low interest rates. That is obviously different to any issue of alleged market manipulation by banks.'
