A girl's childhood dream of becoming a pro-fish-ional mermaid is going swimmingly - after completing fish school.

Andrea Liguori, 19, attended mermaid school as a child where she learned to swim using a prosthetic tail and how to perform stunning tricks.

The underwater obsessive became hooked on the legendary aquatic creatures after watching a performance of The Little Mermaid aged just three.

She would beg her parents to drive her from their Hernando Beach home in Florida, USA, to the tiny city of Weeki Wachee - where professional female divers have performed as mermaids since 1947.

Weeki Wachee - dubbed 'The Only City of Live Mermaids' - is one of the smallest cities in the US with a population of nine but would regularly draw up to one million tourists per year at its peak in the 1960s.

Andrea and her family visited the park so often that she was able to learn every routine by heart.

After turning eight she was finally old enough to experience life as a mermaid and began attending mermaid school at Weeki Wachee.

Andrea is now fulfilling her dream of being a professional mermaid at Weeki Wachee - dubbed 'The Only City of Live Mermaids'

She said: 'I'd wanted to be a mermaid from the first time I saw the show at Weeki Wachee - they looked so graceful and magical.

'Mermaid school was an experience of a lifetime. I got to wear a tail, swim in the spring and meet the mermaids - it was everything I expected and more.'

Andrea enjoyed the experience so much that she attended the school multiple times over the next few years until a position opened up to become a full time mermaid - the chance to fulfill her dream.

After a successful interview and trial show the brunette beauty was offered the job ahead of around 50 other applicants - and now performs for tourists from all over the world.

'I'd wanted to be a mermaid since I was three-years-old so when it finally happened I was so happy - it was a dream come true,' she said.

'It took about a month of intense training but the feeling of being in the spring water and performing a show is like no other.

'I am able to live my dream of swimming in the spring with my best friends and keeping the dream alive for other children around the world.'
