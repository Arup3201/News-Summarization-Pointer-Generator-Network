Jonathan Parker was suspended after pupils' parents complained his comments were racist 

A teacher has been suspended after being accused of racism over satirical Facebook posts about Ukip and Muslims. 

Jonathan Parker wrote a series of messages on the social network last May in which he 'blamed Muslims' for Sainsbury's running out of pork chops, and jokingly urged followers to 'Vote Ukip'. 

Parents of pupils at Washwood Heath Academy in Birmingham, investigated among other schools amid claims of the spread of Islamic extremism as part of the Trojan Horse scandal, considered the remarks racist and complained. 

Mr Parker was suspended as a result and is currently being investigated by staff at the school. 

Among his posts, the teacher said he was writing a book 'about students' which he would call 'Fifty Shades of c***'. 

In response to a friend who wrote: 'Muslims cause cancer,' the teacher replied: 'Muslims cause paedophilia,' and in a separate post he wrote: 'Sainsburys have run out of pork chops. I blame the Muslims. Vote UKIP.' 

'Bloody tax dodging immigrants. If they paid their own way we'd have more money for health, education, public services and pensions. Right I'm off for a STARBUCKS. Vote UKIP,' was another, while a separate message read: 'Halal meat used in curry houses up and down the country! Hands off our national dish! Vote UKIP.'

His comments were considered 'inflammatory' by a parent at the school which is still reeling from an Ofsted investigation into claims Islamic extremism was being promoted by teachers.

'Teachers should not be saying this kind of stuff even as a joke. It is racist.

'The language used at a time when tensions are high in the city is completely unprofessional.

'Teachers have a duty outside of work to uphold the professions standards and all this has done is fuel the fire within the community.

'They are highly inflammatory comments when you consider most of the pupils are Muslim at the school.'

A 15-year-old pupil added: 'He's always been a popular teacher so we were very shocked when we saw these comments.

'A lot of the pupils are furious about what has happened and were upset and offended that a teacher we trust could say these things.'

But a friend of Mr Parker said the posts were intended as jokes to poke fun at the Ukip during last May's European Elections. 

The man, who did not want to be named, said: 'The messages were to friends only and were satirical, made at the time of the European elections last May, directed against UKIP by sending up the anti-Islamic aspects of their campaign.' 

Washwood Heath Academy was among schools investigated as part of the Trojan Horse scandal over claims teachers were promoting the spread of Islamic extremism in secular schools 

Washwood Heath Academy headteacher Bev Mabey said confirmed a staff member had been suspended in June. 

'Washwood Heath Academy Trust can confirm a member of staff has been suspended.

'An investigation is ongoing and it would inappropriate to comment further at this time.'

Washwood Heath teaches 1,400 boys and girls from the age of 11 to 18, most of whom are Muslim.

This summer, 57 per cent of students achieved 5 A* - C grades at GCSE including English and Maths.
