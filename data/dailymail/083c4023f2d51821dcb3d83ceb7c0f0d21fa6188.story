He is supposed to have his hands full running the country.

But David Cameron looked the picture of a relaxed dad this morning as he stepped out of Downing Street with daughter Florence in one arm and a dolly’s pram in the other.

Embarrassingly it came on the day the government warned too many families struggle to fit their own childcare around their working lives.

Hands full: David Cameron emerged from Number 10 this morning carrying daughter Florence and her toys

The Prime Minister was seen emerging from Number 10 early this morning, with two-year-old Florence cradled in his left arm.

His other hand was struggling with a pink doll’s pram and a purple scooter.

For many dads the idea of taking their children to school or nursery before work is all but impossible.

A new report published today said childcare is a ‘major concern for many families’ and parents face ‘huge difficulties’ in find the right care at the right price.

But Mr Cameron appeared not to have a care in the world as he made his way along Downing Street with his youngest daughter.

Family time: Mr Cameron has spoken of his desire to take his children to school or nursery once a week

On the move: Tourists and people heading to work will have been surprised to see the Prime Minister out and about

He found himself with some extra time in his diary this morning after the meeting of Cabinet was moved to Thursday.

He was later seen helping Florence as she struggled with her scooter on the streets of Whitehall on the way to her nursery.

After dropping her off, the Prime Minister returned to Downing Street where he tried to coax Larry the Cat through the famous door of Number 10.

Later he travelled to Lincoln for a question and answer session with workers at Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery.

Helping hand: The Prime Minister tried to help Florence to stop her blocking the way for cyclists and pedestrians

Rush hour: As two-year-old Florence scooted along, the Prime Minister was left holding the baby

The Prime Minister has insisted on 
taking his children to school or nursery as often as possible, to keep 
his feet on the ground.

Asked
 about being seen on the school run last year he responded by saying: 
'Maybe once a week, sometimes once a fortnight, tragically sometimes 
once a month I manage to take my children to school, but it's got to be 
possible to be a decent husband, a good father and a good prime minister
 at the same time.'

Prowl: Larry the Downing Street cat was also out and about this morning

Animal magic: It took some persuasion, but eventually the Prime Minister managed to coax Larry through the door of Number 10

Mr Cameron added that there is ‘something wrong’ if it is not possible to be Prime Minister and also spend time with family.

‘Actually I would go further than that, the big thing you have to do as prime minister is make a lot of judgement calls and decisions.

'The British public are incredibly fair minded, they know you will get, hopefully, a lot of them right. They know you'll get some of them wrong.

'What they want to know is that your average doesn't fall too low.'

Day job: Later Mr Cameron travelled to Lincoln to take questions from workers

Grilling: Staff at Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery in Lincoln go the chance to put their questions to the Prime Minister

Tour: Mr Cameron met Chris Moulds, 26, (centre) and Wayne Hewitt, 18, (right) as he took a look around the factory

He went on: 'If you are completely fried and 
exhausted and have no time for your family and never go for a jog or 
play a game of tennis or whatever, if you never do those things, you 
will get into a situation where you will make very bad decisions because
 you're exhausted and stressed and all the rest of it.

'So do I try and live some sort of normal life at the same time, yes, and I don't apologise for that.'
