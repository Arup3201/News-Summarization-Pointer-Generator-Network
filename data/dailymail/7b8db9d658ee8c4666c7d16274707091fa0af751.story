A junior footballer has been banned for seven years by FA bosses after allegedly wiping spit on a referee's back.

Jake Schofield, 15, reportedly spat on his hand and smeared it on the official at the end of a game between his side Moston Valley and Failsworth West Juniors in Manchester.

He was reported to Manchester FA and was stunned to later find out he had been banned from playing football until August 2021.

The punishment is six years and eight months longer than Luis Suarez got for biting the shoulder of Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini.

The disgraced Uruguay striker was banned from football for four months - as well as nine internationals - following the incident during the 80th minute of this year's World Cup clash.

It also much worse than Raul Meireles's 11-game ban for spitting at a referee while playing for the Turkish side Fenerbahce in December 2012.

Yesterday, Jake, a centre-back from Harpurhey, said: 'The length of the punishment is well over the top when you compare it to the ban Suarez got for biting or Raul Meireles got.'

The footballer, a student at Manchester 
Communication Academy, denied wiping spit on the referee's back, and claimed the official had 
misunderstood his actions at the final whistle.

'We’d had a few words during the game and at the final whistle I didn’t really want to shake his hand but my manager told me to go and do it,' he said.

'As I walked over I spat on the floor which I admit disrespected him and he said he wouldn’t shake my hand as I’d just spat on it. I told him I hadn’t and as he turned away I patted him on the shoulder.'

Stunned: Jake has played junior football since the age of five with a clean disciplinary record

Jake, who has played junior football since the age of five with a clean disciplinary record, was suspended three weeks after the incident on April 1.

He was later found guilty of assault on a match official and improper conduct against a match official.

According to the notice of suspension on the Manchester FA website, Jake is banned from all football activities, including management, for 2,562 days until August 8, 2021.

However, after being contacted by the Manchester Evening News, bosses at the governing body have now said they will launch an investigation into the decision.

Manchester FA chief executive, Colin Bridgford, said the sanction would be reviewed, pending an appeal from Jake.

'Clearly, this is a case that needs to be investigated in terms of the charge, the process, the panel and the sanction,' he said.

'It does not appear to be in line with other cases in terms of consistency or fairness.'

Manchester FA's discipline officer could not be contacted. It is understood she has taken long-term leave since the decision was made.

The maximum penalty for assault on a match official in junior football is a lifetime ban.

But it is thought the charge could be reduced on appeal to improper conduct against a match official, which carries a maximum suspension of 10 games.
