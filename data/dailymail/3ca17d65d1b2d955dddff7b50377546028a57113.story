Limited subway and commuter rail services will return to storm-ravaged New York City by Thursday, three days after the system was battered by briny floodwaters, but not below 34th Street.

Although New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that limited subway service will be restored throughout the city, stations like the inundated South Ferry remains waterlogged and closed indefinitely.

New York officials are only just beginning to deal with the monstrous after-affects of Sandy, pumping out briny water from saturated subway stations and repairing structural damage.

Sandbags were used to prevent the full impact of the flood water and the station was closed off to the public today while workers attempt to make it fit for purpose

Those downtown will be forced to rely only on buses and taxis, which have been causing massive gridlock throughout New York.

Gov. Cuomo added that limited commuter rail service – including the Long Island Railroad and Metro North – will be restored later today, and that buses will provide transportation. 

MTA chairman Joe Llota told the New York Post: ‘We’re going switch by switch, signal by signal, power substation by power substation and making sure everything is up and running.’

The Post notes that many train yards, stations, and tunnels were damaged by the storm and experienced some form of flooding.

Despite a near halt on mass transit, New Yorkers are starting to resume their day-to-day lives, re-opening businesses and assessing damage.

Below 40th Street, where New Yorkers are on day two without power, some businesses, including restaurants, are open, offering limited food options.

Limited service was also to resume at 2 p.m. Wednesday on two of the city's vital commuter rail systems, Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road.

Both of those rail systems, which extend many miles into the Connecticut and Long Island suburbs, had been knocked out by power failures, downed trees, and, in the case of the LIRR, flooding in tunnels beneath the East River.

Cuomo said three of the seven flooded train tunnels beneath the East River had been pumped out, but restoring them to service could take time, as equipment that was submerged in the storm is inspected and repaired.

Vehicle tunnels, including the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel and the Queens Midtown Tunnel, also took on huge amounts of water. The Brooklyn tunnel alone had an estimated 70 million gallons of water in it Wednesday morning, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said.

Historic shut down: As flood waters inundated many stations including 86th Street, Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that subway service would be shut down until Saturday or Sunday, only the second time it has ever closed

Worst disaster: After several stations were damaged, including 86th Street station, the MTA said the Sandy Superstorm was the worst disaster in the subway's 108-year history

Preemptive effort: Trains stopped running on Sunday night in an effort to secure the subway system, including a emergency dam erected at IRT Subway Lenox terminal

Pump flood waters: Each tunnel is expected to take at leave five days to pump dry, keeping stations closed until Saturday or Sunday

Cuomo's announcement came as New York struggles to recover from Monday night's storm.

Bus service resumed. Flights slowly got back in the air at two major airports and the New York Stock Exchange rang back to life after two days without trading.

But large swathes of the city and its northern suburbs - about 1.6 million customers - remain without power.

The subways carry 5.2 million riders daily; about 2.5 million people use city buses.

The LIRR and Metro-North each has 300,000 daily riders.
