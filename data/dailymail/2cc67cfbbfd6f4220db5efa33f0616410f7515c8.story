Burma began to free prominent dissidents today at the start of a general amnesty for more than six thousand prisoners.

It was not clear how many of the 
country's estimated 2,000 political detainees were included in the 
amnesty - one estimate said 155 of them were freed.

But the 
released included ailing Shan Army commander Hso Hten and comedian 
Zarganar, who was imprisoned after criticising the government's response
to Cyclone Nargis in 2008.

Zarganar said after his release: 'I will be happy and I will thank the 
government only when all of my friends are freed.'

Those still held include student leaders
from the failed 1988 democracy uprising in Burma, also known as Myanmar.

Western governments, the UN and Burma's opposition have eagerly awaited a broad political amnesty as a gesture of liberalisation by the elected government after decades of harsh military rule.

A failure to follow through could hamper the country's efforts to improve its human rights record and have Western economic and political sanctions lifted.

Relatives and freed prisoners held emotional reunions with loved ones around the country a day after the new civilian president declared an amnesty for 6,359 inmates - many of them ordinary criminals - on humanitarian grounds, but without disclosing any names.

Pro-democracy campaigner and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, herself released from 15 years of house arrest last November, said: 'The freedom of each individual is invaluable, but I wish that all political prisoners would be released.'

Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy confirmed the release of 155 political detainees, including members of her party, spokesman Nyan Win said.

But other dissidents could have been freed from remote prisons without having contacted anyone yet.

President Thein Sein, a retired senior army officer who took office in March, has launched a series of economic reforms and eased limits on freedom of speech by relaxing censorship and unblocking banned websites.

He also has started a dialogue with Suu Kyi, made calls for peace with Shan ethnic minority rebel groups and suspended a controversial China-backed hydropower dam project after a public outcry.

Amnesty International called the prisoner release a 'minimum first step'.

Hso Hten, the released Shan Army commander, was serving a 106-year prison sentence for high treason following his arrest in 2005. The Shan are a repressed minority within Burma who have been enganged in conflict with the Burmese government for decades.

It was initially thought that Ashin Gambira, a young charismatic Buddhist monk who was among the leaders of the September 2007 anti-government uprising, had been freed but it transpired that he was still in prison.

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary 
Clinton, speaking to Reuters, said she was encouraged by 'promising 
signals' of political reform but it was too early to announce any steps 
Washington might take in response.

The
United States, Europe and Australia have said freeing an estimated 
2,100 political prisoners in Burma is essential to even considering 
lifting sanctions that have crippled the pariah state and, over years, 
driven it closer to China.

Mrs Clinton said: 'We're encouraged by the steps we see the
government taking... we're going to take them at their word.

'But we want to see actions. And if they are going to release political prisoners that would be a very positive sign.'

Previous general amnesties have 
included only a token number of political prisoners but there was optimism this time as the Burmese government seeks to 
distance itself from China and makes overtures to the West.

The army nominally handed over power 
in March to civilians after elections in November, a process ridiculed 
at the time as a sham to cement authoritarian rule behind a democratic 
facade.

Nevertheless, President Thein Sein, the first civilian head of state in half a century, 
has initiated overtures including calls to win over ethnic 
minorities.

The new national human rights 
commission called on the president in an open letter published in state 
media on Tuesday to free prisoners who did not pose 'a threat to the 
stability of state and public tranquillity'.

Zarganar , 49, was imprisoned after speaking out against the official response to cyclone Nargis in 2008, which left more than 140,000 people dead.

He is celebrated for his films, plays and poetry and even dubbed the comedy Dalai Lama.

But even though he was imprisoned 900 miles away from his family in Myitkyina prison in Rangoon in 2010 a brief poem penned by him was passed to a friend.

It read: 'It's lucky my forehead is flat/Since my arm must often rest there/Beneath it shines a light I must invite/From a moon I cannot see/In Myitkyina.'

This was the forth time the comedian had been imprisoned

He had always insisted humour would prevail: 'Burmese people love to laugh. If I can’t speak, jokes will still spread. People will make them up themselves.'

The
open letter marks a significant shift in the former British colony where authorities have long refused to recognise 
the existence of political prisoners, usually dismissing such detainees 
as common criminals.

The government has faced pressure for 
change on multiple fronts, from the need 
to find alternatives to China in the face of popular resentment of its 
influence, to growing frustration in Southeast Asia over Burma's 
isolation as the region approaches an EU-style Asian community in 2015.

Diplomats
say other factors play into its desire to open up, include a need
for technical assistance from the World Bank and other multilateral 
institutions which cut off ties years ago in response to abuses of human rights.

Nestled
strategically between the powerhouses of India and China, Burma has been one
of the world's most difficult destinations for investors, restricted by
sanctions, blighted by half a century of oppressive military rule and 
starved of capital despite rich natural resources, from gems to timber 
to oil.

The country's infrastructure is in 
shambles and its economy has few sources of growth beyond investment 
from China and Thailand. About 30 per cent of its 50 million people live 
in poverty, according to UN data.

Some analysts say Burma also wants to show the United States that it is independent of China.

Last week, the government suspended a £2.3billion Chinese-led dam project, a victory for
supporters of Suu Kyi and a sign the country was willing to yield to 
popular resentment over China's growing influence.

These
moves have fuelled hopes the new parliament will slowly open the 
country that just over 50 years ago was one of Southeast Asia's 
wealthiest as the world's biggest rice exporter and a major energy 
producer.

In Tokyo, a foreign ministry official 
said Japan had resumed some aid to Burma in June after the release of 
Suu Kyi and other signs of reform.

'We may continue with this stance if 
there are more releases of political prisoners,' the official said. 
'Work still needs to be done in terms of democracy but we think they are
moving in the right direction.'
