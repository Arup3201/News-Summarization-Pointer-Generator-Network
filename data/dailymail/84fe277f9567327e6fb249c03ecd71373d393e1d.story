A young boy and girl who both underwent liver transplants as babies are now best friends.

Tegan Ross and Lennox Nicholson underwent the life-saving operations at the same hospital just two months apart.

Their families bonded over their similar experiences and continue to visit each other seven years later.

Tegan's mother Michelle Davidson, 27, said: 'Tegan's transplant has been a great success.

'Our family's still great friends with Simon and Amy, Lennox's parents, and we regularly visit them in Guisborough.

'Tegan, seven, and Lennox and his sister Lacey are big friends. I will always be so grateful to the mystery donor who saved her.'

Tegan survived a 10-hour long lifesaving liver transplant operation at St James' University Hospital in Leeds in February 2006.

Last week was the seventh anniversary of her successful surgery.

Tegan, from Darlington, said: 'I'm 
feeling great and am doing fantastic. I like drawing and making cards 
for Lennox and his family.'

Her best friend Lennox, from Guisborough, went under the knife just weeks before in December 2005.

He had appeared healthy when he was born on June 21, 2005, but within weeks he developed jaundice and chronic liver
problems. An eight-hour operation found his bile ducts were
completely blocked and the only way to save his life was to give
him a transplant.

Now Lennox's mother Amy said that 
apart from taking regular medication, he is just like any other 
seven-year-old and is full of fun and mischief.

Both their families are keen to stress the importance of signing up to become an organ donor. Tegan's family don't know who donated her liver, while Lennox's donor was a 50-year-old woman from the Leeds area.

Tegan was born on May 7, 2005 at Darlington Memorial Hospital and later diagnosed with biliary atresia - inflammation which can fatally damage the liver's bile ducts.

An unsuccessful operation to correct the condition meant she was put on the transplant list and had her lifesaving operation on February 1, 2006.

Ms Davidson said: 'Tegan's been given a new life thanks to the surgeons, nurses and the donor.'
