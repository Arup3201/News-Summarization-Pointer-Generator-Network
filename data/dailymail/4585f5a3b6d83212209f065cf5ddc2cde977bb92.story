A young mother was killed by a party drug while marking the death hours earlier of a friend who had taken the same substance.

Lynette Nock, 28, collapsed in front of friends she had invited to her house after the death of Carl Fearon, 24.

Both are believed to have taken GBL, which comes in liquid form and is mixed with soft drinks.

Saturday’s deaths are the latest linked to the Class C drug that can be purchased legally as an alloy-wheel cleaner.

Known to clubbers as ‘coma in a bottle’,
GBL achieved notoriety three years ago when it claimed the life of 
medical student Hester Stewart, whose mother now campaigns to raise 
awareness of its dangers.

GBL is usually diluted with water or juice and is virtually tasteless, but produces a high not dissimilar to ecstasy.

It can damage the kidneys, liver and the stomach lining and can lead to psychosis.

Once
in the body, chemical reactions turn GBL into now notorious drug GHB, 
which was banned in 2003 because it was being used as a date rape drug.

Although
legal for use in the chemical industry - in cleaning products, solvents
and paints - it has been banned for recreational use since 2009 and is a
Class C drug.

Deaths that have been linked with GBL include that of Sarah O'Dowd, 24, who drowned in her bath in October 2007.

Brighton medical student Hester Stewart died in April after taking GBL and drinking alcohol.

A 25-year-old man died hours after taking GBL on its own while out clubbing in 2008.

But
because traces of GBL remain in the body for only up to 12 hours after 
consumption, the true number of fatalities is unknown.

Family and friends yesterday spoke of their shock at losing Miss Nock, an accountant with a ten-year-old son.

Mr Fearon, an Aston Martin engineer and 
former Ibiza holiday rep, is thought to have collapsed on Friday night 
at a party in Birmingham. His body was discovered on Saturday afternoon.

A few hours later Miss Nock invited 
grieving friends to her flat in the Northfield area of the city, where 
she was found dead that evening.

Two male guests were taken to hospital 
with overdoses but have since been discharged. Police are treating both 
deaths as unexplained while toxicology tests are carried out.

Miss Nock’s father, Dave, 69, said: ‘Was
it that their drink was spiked? From what I’ve read, this GBL has no 
taste and no smell. It could easily have been slipped into a drink. They
could have been oblivious to it.’

Mr Nock, who has custody of his grandson
Christopher, heard from his daughter on Saturday when she called to 
tell him of Mr Fearon’s death.

‘She was sobbing her heart out and was 
in bits over his death,’ he added. ‘There was no mention of drugs. The 
last thing she said was that she would phone us later on. The whole 
family is in shock. Lynette was so kind.

‘I want to know how many other people will have to die before something is done about GBL. It’s a lethal drug. A killer.’

Miss Nock’s cousin, Melanie Adams, said:
‘Lynette was always sensible, a nice girl who worked hard. She liked to
party and drink with her friends.

‘She went to festivals and had fun but I
really didn’t think she would dabble in something like this, especially
after her friend died.

‘I just feel for her son and her 
parents. My dad went round to see them and Lynette’s mum collapsed in 
his arms. Dave had a heart attack when he was told. It’s just such a 
shock.’

Kind-hearted: Miss Nock was described by her heartbroken parents Dave and Tracie as a 'golden girl who would help anybody'

Dark day: Three people were taken to hospital after the wake held for Aston Martin worker Mr Fearon

Maryon Stewart, whose Angelus Foundation
campaigns for drugs education in schools, said: ‘It is unforgiveable 
that two people have died taking the same stuff in the same day.

‘Young people think it is just a party drug but withdrawals when you take GBL are worse than heroin.

‘It is a horrendous drug. If they knew what it did, no one in their right mind would take it.

‘The problem is people don’t care 
enough. My daughter was an athlete and a medical student – the least 
likely person to have taken it. But she died three years ago and there 
is still no national campaign. The government has been given enough 
information.’

Neighbours yesterday described the 
drug-fuelled wake that cost Miss Nock her life. One said: ‘They were 
having a wake to honour their friend who died and, quite stupidly, they 
did this by taking the same drug which killed him.’

Another, 24-year-old Emma Heath, said: 
‘I heard they put it in a Fanta bottle and several of them ended up 
being taken to hospital.’

Shocking episode: Mr Fearon died at his city centre flat and Miss Nock at her home later the same night

Pete Jones, a 43-year-old former 
paramedic, paid tribute to Mr Fearon, saying: ‘Carl was loved by so 
many, he really was one of a million. He was the most genuine and lovely
guy.’

Andy Hawkins, a detective inspector for 
West Midlands Police, said: ‘We believe that the controlled substance 
Gamma-Butyrolactone or GBL, the base solvent to a number of alloy wheel 
cleaners, super glue removers and paint strippers, may have been used as
a drug at the gathering at the address in Northfield.’

Post-mortem examinations into the deaths of the deaths have proved inconclusive.

GBL, which has a similar effect to ecstasy, was banned in December 2009 following a spate of deaths.

Users take it in tiny quantities, measuring it in a syringe before mixing it with juice.
