For the past decade, a trip to the cinema using two-for-one cinema tickets on a Wednesday has become a regular habit for millions of Britons.

But now, it’s curtains for Orange Wednesdays, as EE is closing the popular scheme in February 2015.

When it launched, the offer may have proved an enticing incentive for cinema goers to pick Orange as their mobile network of choice.

But now other networks are offering rival incentives and less people are using Orange Wednesdays, perhaps streaming films to tablets and TVs instead, leading EE to cite 'changing viewing habits' as the reason for closing the scheme.

‘Orange Wednesday at its peak was a massive success and an iconic promotion,’ EE said.

EE has promised that there will be a replacement

‘Our brand has changed and our customers' viewing habits have also evolved so it's time to move on.’

The deal currently gets EE customers a cheap meal at the Pizza Express restaurant chain too.

Many fans of the scheme feared that EE might roll the credits on Orange Wednesdays, when T-Mobile and Orange merged in 2010.

However, EE has promised that there will be a replacement.

‘We're working on new customer entertainment rewards and we'll provide more details soon.’

If the offer doesn’t prove as compelling for customers, they may well swap to Vodafone or O2, which offer copycat schemes of Orange Wednesday.

O2's Priority Moments gives customers special offers on Odeon cinema tickets, for example.

If you're planning on axing mid-week cinema trips in the New Year, a £16 gadget lets you project films streamed to a smartphone onto any surface.

Made from cardboard, the simple design also claims to amplify the sound without the need for additional wires or a separate sound system.

The black and white Smart Phone Projector is listed on on PrezzyBox.com and can be set up 'within minutes,' according to its maker, Luckies of London.

Cheap alternative to the cinema? The Smart Phone projector costs less than two trips to the cinema and claims to project films stored on, or streamed to smartphones, onto a chosen surface

It has a 10x magnifying lens at the front to increase the video size on a wall and a grip pad on the back to securely hold a smartphone in place.

The portable gadget costs £15.95 ($27), and means you can turn any room in your home into a cinema screen.

But there are a number compromises. For instance, the projection is dim, small, and can often be blurry. There are also no volume controls.
