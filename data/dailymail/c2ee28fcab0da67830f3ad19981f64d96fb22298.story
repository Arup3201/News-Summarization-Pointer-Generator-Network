Applying to become an air hostess in many countries involves a rigorous interview procedure. 

But in China, they place equal emphasis on those applying to work on their new bullet trains. 

1,500 applicants took part in five different professional exams in a bid to become one of the 90 new students for the bullet train attendant training course earlier today.

The mix of women and men went through a number of different tests at the event held by Shandong Jiaotong University in Jinan, Shandong province of China. 

The guidelines to become one of the attendants are extremely strict and take into account everything from skills to body height. 

Zulhumar Tursun, 22, who was enrolled on an earlier training programme told China Daily that when she applied in 2014, she was chosen from nearly 5,000 applicants. 

She said: 'Applicants need to be 166 to 174 centimeters tall and the desired weight ranges from 52 to 58 kilograms.'

Balance is a key issue on the bullet trains, which reach extremely high speeds 

Some of the women were already dressed in attendant uniforms for the exams

The successful applicants are then sent to train in internships on high-speed lines across the country.

Drivers of the trains have to undergo even stricter tests that take several aspects of their health into account. 

Driver Adi Turdi told the paper: 'We had our eyesight, hearing and hearts checked, as well as our psychological condition, because the requirements for bullet train drivers are higher than those for operators of lower-speed trains. 

'We [then] traveled to Beijing to attend interviews and training courses.'
