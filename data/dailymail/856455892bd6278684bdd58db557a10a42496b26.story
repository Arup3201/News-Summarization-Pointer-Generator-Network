A young entrepreneur was baffled when a Portland security guard thwarted her attempt to help her father pay for her braces by selling mistletoe - but told her she could beg, instead.Madison Root, 11, arrived bright and early at Portland Saturday Market, setting up a sign and basket next to the Skidmore Fountain in the downtown area to sell her wares to the crowds.That's when a security guard swooped in and told her to stop selling her mistletoe because she was violating city code - but said that she could beg for money, or give it away and ask for a donation.

Entrepreneur: Madison Root wanted to help her father pay for her braces by selling mistletoe at Portland Saturday Market

Thwarted: The young businesswoman was prevented from selling her wares by bureaucratic red tape

Madison Root knew her upcoming orthodontic work would be expensive, and wanted to contribute.

She
 spent Friday cutting mistletoe at her uncle's farm in Newberg, then 
wrapped it in clear cellophane and tied it with a red ribbon.

Her father, Ashton Root, supported his daughter's work ethic and drove her to the market on Saturday morning.

'I
 wouldn't think I'd have any problems because people are asking for 
money, people are selling stuff, this is a public place,' Madison told 
KATU.

'There were people right next to me with signs that said, 'Got pot?' she said. 'They're raising money for pot!'

Root
 says a private security guard for the market told them that they were 
violating city code (specifically Chapter 20.12.020, 'Soliciting For or 
Conducting Business' in a public park). Under the rule, it's illegal to 
'sell or offer to sell any article or service' without a permit.

Braces: Madison's orthodontic work will cost more than $6,000

Work ethic: Madison spend her time on Friday cutting mistletoe at her uncle's farm, then wrapped it herself to sell

Disappointed: Ashton Root (right) says his daughter would rather work than beg

Disillusioned Madison told KATU, 'People can get money for pot but I can't get money for braces? I'm working for this, they're just sitting down on their butts all day asking for pot.'

Spokesman for the Portland Park Bureau told KATU that while selling at the market without a permit is illegal, begging is designated as a form of free speech, and is protected under the First Amendment.

'We totally understand the rule,' Ashton Root told Oregon Live.

'But here she was selling mistletoe and all around her were people playing music for money, or asking for money for pot, or just spare change. We’re allowing people to beg, but not to sell; it seems like there should be some sort of exception.'

A vendor at the market agrees: 'They should have a caveat for children trying to create options for commerce, especially this time of year,' Sharon Steen, co-owner of Perfect Bowls told KATU.

'We encourage it. We want them to grow up and be entrepreneurs.'

Under the mistletoe: Madison picked the bunches of mistletoe and wrapped them herself

Anything goes... almost: Panhandlers, street musicians and and stalls abound at the Portland Saturday Market, but without a permit, Madison was told she could either beg or give her mistletoe away

The kissoff: Madison Root plans to return to the market to sell mistletoe again in what she is calling 'The Great Kissoff'

When news of Madison's aborted market day got around, one supporter called to order 30 bags of mistletoe. Ashton Root also told ABC News that McKinzei Farms, one of the area's biggest Christmas tree farms, had made a donation of $1,000 for Madison's braces

Despite the windfall, the determined 11-year-old has decided to return to the market with her mistletoe on December 14 for what she is calling 'The Great Kissoff.'

'I feel that I can make a statement and possibly make a difference,' she told Oregon Live.

'The city laws are supporting begging and are against working.'

She is preparing a speech that lays out her 'work for it' mentality and plans to bring mistletoe.

'She may break the law, or just give it away,’ her dad said. 'Donations accepted.'

Madison had the top set of braces fitted today.
