A father in North Carolina locked himself in his car on a sweltering day to raise awareness of a tragic  summer trend that kills dozens of children each year.

Terry Bartley of Greensboro, North Carolina filmed himself sweating and struggling to breathe in his car on a 90-degree day to find out what it's like to be a child forgotten in the back seat.

Mr Bartley posted the video on June 20, just two days after 22-month-old Cooper Harris died after his dad left him in a parked SUV for nine hours.

Torture: Greensboro , North Carolina father Terry Bartley filmed himself suffering in a parked car on a hot day to raise awareness of the dozens of U.S. children who die each year forgotten in the back seat

Harris has since been charged with murder and child cruelty. He has plead not guilty, claiming he left Cooper in the car accidentally.

'I'm sitting in the car with the windows rolled up because I want to know hot it feels to be left in the car and sitting in the back seat, strapped into the car seat,' Mr Bartley says in the video, as sweat streams down his face.

'As you can see, I'm sweating like I can barely breathe out here and my system is stronger than these little kids.'

Too young: Mr Bartley posted the video just two days after the death of 22-month-old Cooper Harris, who was left in the back of his father Justin Ross Harris' SUV for nine hours on a 90-degree day

Mr Bartley says he would never leave his children in the car, even if the engine was running with the air conditioning on.

'They would get out of the car and come with me or I ain't gonna stop at all. This is wrong,' he says.

So far this year, 17 children have died of heatstroke after being left in a car, according to San Francisco State University's Department of Earth & Climate Studies.

On average, about 38 children are killed each year in these circumstances.
