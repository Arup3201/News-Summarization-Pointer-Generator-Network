Jesse Matthew has been charged with the first-degree murder of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham but will not face the death penalty. 

Matthew, 33, already had been charged last year with the 18-year-old's abduction after she went missing on leaving a bar in Charlottesville, Virginia at 2am on September 13.

A month later, Miss Graham's remains were found in a shallow grave behind a rural property, eight miles from where she vanished. Her death was declared a homicide in November.

Albemarle County prosecutor Denise Lunsford announced that Matthew was indicted on a first-degree murder charge at a short press conference on Tuesday but would not give any details on the evidence.

She would not go into details as to why Matthew would not face a capital murder charge which carries the death penalty. 

The 33-year-old is also charged with abduction with intent to defile and two incidents of reckless driving.

Ms Lunsford said that it had been an 'incredibly difficult process' for the Graham family and investigators.

The prosecutor said she had spoken to the Graham family on multiple occasions and that they were aware of the charges being brought against their daughter's alleged killer.

Ms Lunsford also said that the family of another murdered student, Morgan Harrington, had been made aware of the charges brought against Matthew.

There were no pending charges against Matthew with regards to Miss Harrington's death at this time.

DNA evidence has  linked Matthew to Harrington, a 20-year-old Virginia Tech student, who vanished after attending a concert in Charlottesville in October 2009. Her body was found a few months later, hidden at a remote farm. 

Matthew's first court appearance has been scheduled for February 18 at 11am in Albemarle County Court. He is not expected to appear in person but via video link. 

Chief of police, Colonel Steve Sellers, thanked the public for their help in searching for missing sophomore Miss Graham.

The teenager's remains were left close to Matthew's mother former home in Albemarle County. Matthew grew up in the area and is familiar with the surroundings.

Before Miss Graham disappeared, she texted a friend at 1am to tell them that she was lost. 

DNA has linked Matthew to the disappearance and death of UVA student Morgan Harrington in 2009, who vanished after attending a gig in Charlottesville

She was last seen on surveillance footage from a downtown mall in Charlottesville. Matthew was also seen on this footage. 

On September 24, Matthew was charged with abduction with intent to defile after being picked up by police in Galveston, Texas, around 1,300 miles away. 

He was extradited to Virginia to face charges. 

Matthew is now suspected in a string of unsolved deaths, disappearances and sexual assaults across Virginia over the last decade.    

Samantha Ann Clarke, 19, disappeared from Orange County, Virginia in September 2010.

DaShad Laquinn Smith, also 19, disappeared on West Main Street in Charlottesville in November 2012.

As Matthew emerged as the main suspect in Miss Graham's disappearance, it was revealed that he had been accused of sexual assault multiple times in the past 12 years. 

A sexual assault allegation was made against him at Liberty University in Virginia on October 17, 2002, when a woman accused him of raping her on campus.

The allegation was investigated by Lynchburg Police and turned over to the prosecutor's office - but the woman declined to press charges and no witnesses could be found, so the case was dropped.

He dropped out of Liberty University on the day the allegation was made. 

Matthew then attended Christopher Newport University in Virginia where he was accused of another sexual assault on September 7, 2003.

Matthew has been linked to a string of young women's deaths, disappearances and sexual assaults across Virginia over the last ten years

Matthew's name has now been connected to the disappearances of DaShad Laquinn Smith, 19 (right), in November 2012 and Samantha Ann Clarke, 19 (left)  in September 2010. Both young women vanished in the Charlottesville area 

Five days after the alleged incident, Matthew quit the school's football team and a month after, he left the school. It is not clear how the second incident was resolved.  

Matthew is also charged in the sexual assault of a 26-year-old woman in Fairfax, Virginia, in 2005.

Mathew has pleaded not guilty to attempted capital murder, rape and sexual assault in that case.

In January, DNA testing cleared Matthew of involvement in the abduction and murder of Alexis Murphy, the 17-year-old Virginia girl who went missing in 2013 and has never been found. 

Following Mathew's arrest in October, the attorney for Randy Allen Taylor - the man convicted of Miss Murphy's murder - requested that Matthew be properly examined as a possible suspect in the teen's death.
