A nurse is fighting for his life in hospital after becoming the first British victim of the ebola outbreak.

William Pooley, 29, was airlifted back to London after contracting the deadly virus while trying to save lives in Sierra Leone.

Despite the grave dangers, he had selflessly volunteered to serve in a makeshift clinic where other nurses had died from ebola or were too scared to come into work.

He was described as a 'remarkable 
young man' and a natural leader by an American scientist who worked at 
the same hospital in Kenema. 'He had taken on a very big role,' said 
Robert F Garry, a professor in microbiology at

Tulane University in New Orleans. 'We've lost several other nurses including the head nurse who lost her battle against ebola.

'He
 was very well liked by all the nurses and had taken on a pivotal role. 
Some people are just marked out as leaders and he led the nurses. He was
 a very hard worker and they looked up to him.'

Mr Pooley last night arrived back to London in an isolation sack for treatment at the Royal Free Hospital in north London.

Gabriel
 Madiye, Mr Pooley's boss at another Sierra Leone clinic, said: 'Will 
wanted to go to Kenema and help the patients at the hospital there.

'I 
told him not to go, but Will said he felt a very strong responsibility 
to the patients there as they were being abandoned by doctors and nurses
 who were fearful of contracting the ebola virus.

'I told him he would not be able to withstand the disease but he said he had to go.'

Treatment: The hospital is the only centre in the UK equipped to treat ebola and prevent the disease from spreading

Mr Madiye said Mr Pooley, from Woodbridge, Suffolk, had been volunteering at the ebola centre in Kenema for just five weeks.

Previously
 he had been providing palliative care to patients at the Shepherd's 
Hospice in Sierra Leone's capital city, Freetown, and had been there 
since March.

But as the 
ebola epidemic began and he heard that healthcare professionals were 
fleeing for fear of catching the disease, he decided to go to the 
badly-affected region of Kenema, Mr Madiye said.

'I
 have been calling him for updates and he said he was fine, but for the 
past five days I have tried to ring him and he hasn't called back,' said
 Mr Madiye, who is the executive director of the Shepherd's Hospice.

'This
 morning, he said he was being evacuated to Britain. He sounded positive
 and said he would be fine in a couple of weeks and would call me then. 
He said the British doctors would save him.'

Mr Pooley's doctors are said to be confident that, with urgent medical attention, he has a good chance of fighting the disease.

Last night the NHS started a global hunt for remaining supplies of the only treatment thought to combat the virus.

ZMapp,
 an untested drug only ever used on a handful of patients, has shown 
promising results, apparently aiding the recovery of two US missionaries
 who contracted the virus. But Mapp Biopharmaceutical, the American 
company behind it, says stocks are exhausted.

A
 source at the Department of Health said: 'We are working with our 
international partners to source remaining doses for the patient.'

Mr
 Pooley is the only Briton to be have ever been infected by ebola 
outside the laboratory. The only other British case was in 1976, when 
scientist Geoffrey Platt pricked himself with a needle contaminated with
 the virus.

Health officials
 last night said Mr Pooley was 'not seriously unwell' – a factor which 
will significantly boost his chance of survival. Most patients die of 
ebola because of dehydration, when their blood vessels break down and 
their major organs fail.

But
 fit, young patients who are given quick treatment have a vastly 
improved chance of survival. If they are hydrated and the bleeding 
controlled, their immune systems can in some cases kick in, and defeat 
the virus.

The World Health 
Organisation has put the number of people infected with the deadly virus
 at 2,615 and declared the crisis to be a 'global health emergency'.

Some
 1,427 have died since the disease was identified in Guinea in March and
 spread to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. Last night two people were
 reported to have died of ebola in the Congo, in what is thought to be a
 new outbreak. Around 300 have become infected in Kenema, the district 
where Mr Pooley was working.

The
 World Health Organisation approved ZMapp for use two weeks ago, an 
extraordinary decision given that the drug had not been widely tested. 
It was used to treat Nancy Writebol and Kent Brantly, who have since 
been discharged from hospital.

Britain's first ebola patient will be treated at the country’s only High Secure Infectious Disease Unit (HSIDU), at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, North London.

It contains just two beds in a ward large enough to normally fit 20. The medic will be wheeled in, enclosed in the same isolation tent used to transport him from Sierra Leone, to minimise contamination risk.

Expert: Dr Stephen Mepham will be among the medics treating the ebola patients

The unit contains an array of special equipment to ensure he does not pass on the virus – including a ‘negative pressure’ air flow to make sure no virus particles escape either the tent or the room itself.

He will be treated by a specialist team including infectious diseases consultant Dr Stephen Mepham. 

Protection: Red Cross volunteers are pictured above in protective gear to defend them from infection

Dangerous: Ebola, which is transmitted through contact with fluids such as blood and mucus from infected people and animals, has killed more than 1,000 people in West Africa

Tests: A protected health worker scans a Liberian for signs of the deadly illness

Ebola is an infectious and usually fatal disease which spreads through contact with body fluids.

Initial symptoms include muscle pain, fever and a sore throat which turns into severe internal bleeding from the mouth, rectum and eyes.

The virus attacks almost all kinds of tissue, reducing organs and flesh to a pudding-like mush.

Up to 90 per cent of victims die – making ebola one of the most lethal viruses known to man.

Lethal: The virus, pictured above under a microscope, almost always kills

Most succumb within six to 16 days of infection. Since the disease was identified in 1976, no clinically proven cure has emerged.

However, charity MSF has improved survival rates using antibiotics.

Outbreaks have occurred primarily in remote villages in central and West Africa, near tropical rainforests.
