Tensions between Japan and China deepened this week as a territorial row over a group of disputed island intensified.

Japan lodged an official protest after three Chinese ships entered, what it considers to be, their territorial waters in the East China Sea.

The move has prompted renewed efforts to cool tensions between the rivals in a long-running feud over ownership of the islands.

The ongoing row threatening relations between Asia's biggest economies could further be complicated by Taiwan - which also claims ownership of the rocky isles.

A group of Taiwanese fishermen said as many as 100 boats escorted by 10 Taiwan Coast Guard vessels would arrive in the area later on Monday.

China's Xinhua news agency said in the morning that two civilian surveillance ships were undertaking a 'rights defence' patrol near the islands, citing the State Oceanic Administration, which controls the ships. One fishery patrol vessel was also detected inside waters claimed by Japan.

By afternoon, all three Chinese vessels had moved further away, the Japanese Coast Guard said.

China and Japan, which generated two-way 
trade of $345 billion last year, are arguing over a group of uninhabited
 islands in the East China Sea, a long-standing dispute that has erupted in recent weeks.Â 

Sino-Japanese relations deteriorated sharply after Japanese government decided to buy some of the islands - called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China - from a
 private Japanese owner.

The move, which infuriated Beijing, 
was intended by Japan's government to fend off what it feared would be 
seen as an even more provocative plan by the nationalist governor of 
Tokyo to buy and build facilities on the islands.

In response, China sent six surveillance ships to the area, which contains potentially large gas reserves.

There were scenes of violent disorder as anti-Japan protests erupted in China.

Japanese factories were forced to temporarily close in China and expatriate workers advised to stay indoors after angry demonstrations spilled on to the streets.

There were violent attacks on well-known Japanese businesses in China, such as car-makers Toyota and Honda, in the country's worst outbreak of anti-Japan sentiment in decades.

China's Xinhua news agency said of 
this latest development in the ongoing row: 'In recent days, Japan has 
constantly provoked incidents concerning the Diaoyu islands issue, 
gravely violating China's territorial sovereignty.'

It added that the ship patrols were intended to exercise China's 'administrative jurisdiction' over the islands.

It said: 'Following the relevant laws 
of the People's Republic of China, (the ships) again carried out a 
regular rights defence patrol in our territorial waters around the 
Diaoyu islands.'

Sino-Japanese ties have long been 
plagued by China's memories of Japan's military aggression in the 1930s 
and 1940s and present rivalry over regional influence and resources.

Japanese
 Vice Foreign Minister Chikao Kawai will visit China on Monday to 
discuss Sino-Japanese relations with Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhang
 Zhijun, the Foreign Ministry said.

The arrival of Taiwan vessels in the 
area could complicate the potentially fraught game of cat-and-mouse 
being played near the islands, where mainland China has launched an 
effort to assert sovereignty by sending government ships into the 
disputed waters.

Taiwan television showed the boats leaving Suao port in heavy rain, sporting banners and large Taiwan flags.

The
 Taiwan fishing group said their boats would sail around the islands to 
reassert their right to fish there and did not rule out trying to land 
on the rocky isles.

Taiwan Defence Minister Kao Hua-chu told parliament that the military was ready for any contingency, but did not elaborate.

Taiwan
 has traditionally had friendly ties with Japan, but the two countries 
have long squabbled over fishing rights in the area. Beijing deems 
Taiwan to be an illegitimate breakaway province, and the two sides both 
argue they have inherited China's historic sovereignty over the islands,
 which are near rich fishing grounds and potentially huge oil and gas 
reserves.

The latest 
flare-up in tensions over the islands comes at a time when both China 
and Japan confront domestic political pressures. Japanese Prime Minister
 Yoshihiko Noda's government faces an election in months, adding 
pressure on him not to look weak on China.

China's
 Communist Party is preoccupied with a leadership turnover, with 
President Hu Jintao due to step down as party leader at a congress that 
could open as soon as next month.

Noda
 leaves for New York on Monday to take part in the annual gathering of 
the U.N. General Assembly, and attention will focus on whether he refers
 to the dispute.

Worries are
 simmering that the row could hurt the economic ties that closely bind 
China and Japan. China is Japan's largest trading partner. In 2011, 
their bilateral trade grew 14.3 percent in value to a record $345 
billion.

Tokyo's Nikkei 
China 50 index, composed of stocks of Japanese companies with 
significant exposure to the world's second-largest economy, shed about 
1.3 percent on concerns over the dispute.

Bank
 of America Merrill Lynch said Japanese car manufacturers saw a 90 
percent drop in showroom traffic and a 60 percent fall in sales in the 
southern Chinese province of Guangdong, the largest market for Japanese 
brands, since the beginning of the anti-Japan protests.
