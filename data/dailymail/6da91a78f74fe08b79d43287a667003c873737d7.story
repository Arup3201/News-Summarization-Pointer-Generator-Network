Barclays Bank was last night accused of ‘incompetence’ and urged to review hundreds of payouts to victims of the PPI scandal after it emerged some customers could have missed out on compensation while others were paid automatically.

MPs piled pressure on the bank after an investigation by The Mail on Sunday found that some staff were given the wrong rules for awarding compensation.

Hundreds of people who were sold payment protection insurance on their Barclaycards were affected by the mistake.

The error meant customers who happened to have been dealt with by the bank’s Leeds office were awarded automatic payouts, while others had to fight for compensation.

Barclays has insisted that nobody lost out, but now faces having to explain to MPs, the Financial Conduct Authority and angry customers how what it describes as a ‘minor glitch’ could have occurred.

MP John Mann, who sits on the Treasury Select Committee, said: ‘This is a major issue. What Barclays needs to do is ensure that all their customers are compensated to the maximum amount.

They should re-examine all the cases that are affected. I am going to raise this with the Financial Conduct Authority.’

Mark Garnier, MP for Wyre Forest and a member of the Banking Commission set up to look into reforms of the industry, added: ‘The charge here may not involve having cost anyone money; the charge is being incompetent.’

Barclays was one of the worst offenders when it came to the  mis-selling of PPI to people who neither asked for it nor needed it. 

Tens of thousands of customers paid for cover unnecessarily and Barclays has set aside £3.95 billion for compensation.

It emerged in July last year that an office in Leeds had been working to different rules from another four sites that Barclays had created to handle PPI compensation claims.

The Leeds case handlers were automatically compensating people who had bought PPI for their Barclaycard over the phone instead of deciding each case on its merits.

A whistleblower said: ‘When  managers found out about this, they told us, “This has happened, let’s move forward”.’

Case handlers worked from an online manual which was updated across all five sites in April 2013.

But a technical failure meant the new version did not fully upload  for the Leeds workers.

Contractors became aware of the error in July 2013 after a spot-check.

On July 29, a manager alerted staff in an email saying ‘an error has been made in the operating instructions’.

Managers held a meeting and the matter was never mentioned again, according to the whistleblower.

The revelation that the bank did not notice that it was operating a two-tier system for three months has left customers furious.

Nahida Goodchild, 51, was upset when, after fighting for compensation for three years, Barclays decided that all she deserved was £238, even though PPI had been added without her consent to her Barclaycard 20 years ago. 

Payouts average £2,500 but the figure varies widely.

‘I am flabbergasted to think some people got their money automatically,’ said the mother-of-two from Ipswich.

‘It makes me feel even more angry. The least you expect is that everyone is treated fairly.’

A Barclays spokesman said: ‘No customer has been denied redress or treated unfairly in relation to these claims, which relate to less than one per cent of PPI cases during a period of three-and-a-half months.

'Those customers, of which we estimate there were less than 200, were only advantaged.’

A spokesman for the Financial Conduct Authority said of Barclays’ PPI-handling operations: ‘We are very closely working with their teams and understand how they are handling complaints.’
