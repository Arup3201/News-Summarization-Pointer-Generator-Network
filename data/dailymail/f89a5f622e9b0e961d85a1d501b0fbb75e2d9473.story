A private school maths teacher accused of grooming and having sex with a 15-year-old girl appeared in court today.

John Wunderle, 34, taught at the £15,000-a-year Bancroft's School in Woodford Green, Essex, and had been on bail for grooming a girl when she was seen in the back of his car, it was said.

The £40,000-a-year teacher, who is said to weight 20 stone, was arrested after allegedly trying to drive off with a teenager in Woodford Green on August 1.

Wunderle was remanded in custody by 
magistrates and appeared at Snaresbrook Crown Court in north-east London
 via video link from HMP Pentonville in north London this morning.

He faces two charges of engaging in sexual activity with a minor and two of inciting a minor into sexual activity.

Brown haired-Wunderle sported a thick beard and wore thick-rimmed glasses. He sat staring at the camera as the court decided on his next 
appearance date.

Two women, one middle-aged and one older, sat in the public gallery.

Denying
 Wunderle bail, Judge William Kennedy told the defendant: ‘There are two
 significant dates.

'The first on October 20, you will come back to this 
court and be invited to plead guilty or not guilty.

‘If
 your plea remains not guilty, your trial will be set for December 15. 
You will remain in custody until at least October 20 for reasons already
 given. Do you understand?’

Wunderle, of Waltham, Essex replied: ‘I do, thank you your honour.’
