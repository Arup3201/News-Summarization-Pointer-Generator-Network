Gerard Pique has revealed how new Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal once told him he was not 'tough enough to be a centre-back'.

The Spanish star was coming through the ranks when the then Barcelona boss shoved him to the floor during a chance meeting at the teenager's grandfather's house.

However, Pique proved the Dutch coach 
wrong and went on to have a successful career in the heart of defence at
 Old Trafford and the Nou Camp.

'I didn't know him a lot because I was really young when he was Barcelona's coach, but he had a really good relationship with my grandfather, the former vice-president of the club,' he told Sport.

'I had the chance to see him one day at my grandfather's house when I was 12 or 13 years old.

'He arrived at the house and he knew I was playing for the Barcelona youth team.

'He pushed me and I fell to the floor, and he said "you are not tough enough to be a centre-back".

'So, yes, he really is a disciplinarian, and I think he will do brilliantly here. I think he will be great.'
