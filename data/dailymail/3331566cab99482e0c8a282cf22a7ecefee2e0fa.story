A number of European countries have already contacted FIFA about possible training bases for the 2018 World Cup, despite it being under two months since the 2014 final.

And this ultra-forward planning comes at a time when European Union diplomats are supporting a boycott of the tournament in Russia as an effective protest from the West over Vladimir Putin’s military stance over Ukraine.

David Cameron is also said to back the recommendations to suspend Russia from high profile sporting events, including the World Cup, in an options paper being circulated around the European capitals.

Pressure: UEFA President Michel Platini will face tough questions about Russia's political stance

But UEFA’s national teams have no intention of becoming involved in the politics, as shown by Germany and Holland’s football federations who are understood to have already started their preparations for the tournament. The FA, currently finalising their preferred bases for Euro 2016, have yet to turn their attention to Russia.

And Russia’s planning for the event, unlike the chaotic build-up to Brazil 2014 and the continuing concern over Qatar 2022, is already well advanced. This includes laying on extra flights to the more remote World Cup venues.

The qualifying draw will take place in St Petersburg next July. Cameron was part of the FA delegation in Zurich 2010 that attracted just one vote from outside the UK for the 2018 World Cup to be held in England.

In his MCC Cowdrey lecture on Thursday night, Ian Botham called for the Ashes urn to be retained by the victorious team, despite the original artefact being far too fragile to leave the Lord’s Museum since going on tour to Australia in 2006-07. Botham also revealed PM David Cameron had promised to get back to him over schools sport but had never done so.

Football League backers Sky Bet came to the rescue of League Two club Accrington Stanley, whose players’ boots were stolen, by providing new footwear. But the gesture only serves to highlight the conflict of bookmaker sponsorship in football. Accrington’s former managing director Rob Heys is banned from all football activity for 21 months for multiple breaches of football betting regulations.

Sky Sports News will find Leeds only willing to talk to their cameras when they are contractually obliged to, following the club’s upset at the network continuing to broadcast sacked head coach David Hockaday’s compensation at £10,000, despite being informed by Leeds it wasn’t correct. Leeds have still to settle with Hockaday but the number is likely to be a lot nearer six figures.

Bookies play with fire

Paddy Power, the most rabid of bookmaker publicists, have added to the growing consternation at the way Sky Sports News have turned transfer deadline day into an unedifying circus.

PP’s charmless contribution was to offer a betting market on fans burning their own club shirts live on SSN. A Premier League source said: ‘This is not the sort of thing we want to see encouraged,’ but a spokesman for the betting firm defended their actions: ‘It was tongue in cheek and wasn’t the most irresponsible thing done on deadline day.’

The Ryder Cup will break from tradition this month by scrapping the closing ceremony and instead holding the trophy presentation on the 18th green. This is to minimise the time between the match finishing and the cup being held aloft, especially with the light fading at that time of year. It also spares the crowd listening to too many speeches about how proud each captain is, and would have saved the likes of Nick Faldo putting his foot in it when he infuriated 2010 hosts Celtic Manor with his remarks in 2008 about cagoules being needed in Wales — which they were.

The Premier League have received plenty of valid criticism about their dysfunctional relationship with the FA being at the heart of the national team’s problems — especially when compared with world champions Germany, where the national association and the Bundesliga are joined at the hip. The PL’s front-foot response is that Germany’s national football federation has a majority of representatives on the board from Bundesliga clubs.
