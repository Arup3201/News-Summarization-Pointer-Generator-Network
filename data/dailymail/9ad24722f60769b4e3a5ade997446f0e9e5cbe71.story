Relief: Hollie Bentley (left) avoided a prison sentence despite posting messages on her Facebook page to encouraging people to loot during the UK riots

A teenager facing jail for inciting a 
riot during the summer troubles walked free from court yesterday after a
judge decided she was guilty only of making a ‘stupid’ joke on 
Facebook.

Hollie Bentley, 19, had faced a five-year jail sentence under a relatively new section of the Serious Crime Act of 'encouraging the commission of an offence believing it would be committed'.

But Judge Peter Collier QC recognised that slang acronyms such as LMFAO backed up her claim that her 'Wakey Riots' event page had been set up in jest.

Bentley had created the Facebook group and even posted on the message board, just hours before looters trawled shops, homes and local businesses throughout the UK.

Her messages such as LMFAO - which means 'Laughing My F****** Arse Off' and is used to indicate you're laughing - were alleged by authorities to have incited criminality.

But the judge said he could not accept that the term referred to Miss Bentley 'sitting in her bedroom laughing inwardly
about Wakefield being burned to the ground'.

The former pupil at Wakefield Cathedral School was stunned when a marked police car turned up at her door in at the family home in the suburbs of the West Yorkshire town on the evening of 'one of the darkest summer days' Britain had ever seen.

She was placed in the back and taken to the police station where she spent the night in custody before telling police the following afternoon she 'was just mucking about'.

At Leeds Crown Court yesterday the case was thrown out after a one-hour 'trial' that followed a previous Crown Court plea and directions hearing and two magistrates' court appearances.

There was no dispute that Bentley created the Facebook event page 'Wakey Riots' which was sent to more than 700 people on Tuesday August 9 about 5.30pm.

In the early hours of the following morning police would face their fourth night of rioting and running battles with looters in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Salford, Nottingham and Liverpool.

However, Judge Collier, the Recorder of Leeds, said there was not enough evidence to disprove Miss Bentley's claim that it was a joke, adding: 'That's been her account from the start'.

The judge was also bemused that police had not asked Miss Bentley about the letters LMFAO.

Defending barrister Matthew Harding said: 'To put it bluntly, it's riddled with references to jokes.'

Richard Clews, prosecuting, also failed to mention the letters when opening the case and when asked by the judge what if he knew what the abbreviation meant said he did not and had 'no instructions'.

Opening the case Mr Clews told the jury: 'It is not in dispute as to what happened. The key issue is what was meant by what happened. That's for you to decide - to interpret the actions of the defendant which she admitted carrying out.

'This was in the dark days of summer just gone, metaphorically speaking. Some of the darkest days perhaps you will recall this country has had on its shores for a number of years.

'I'm talking about the riots. On August 9th the country was in the thick of them.

'The prosecution say no one could think anything like that was funny. It's not funny now. It certainly was not funny on 9 August.'

The case against Miss Bentley suggested her Facebook group encouraged looters

The court was told Miss Bentley, who is now pregnant and expecting her first child in April, had been sitting alone in her bedroom that evening when she created the Wakey Riots page with a picture of the town centre and the cathedral and message: 'Who's up for it?'

She told police because of the way the Facebook events system works she had to put a date in and chose the following Saturday when Wakefield city centre would have been packed with people.

The event was received by more than 700 people, of which 62 replied they would not come, 16 said they could, five were "maybes" and 691 did not reply.

Miss Bentley admitted she did not actually know most of them. The alarm was raised when one of Miss Bentley's Facebook Friends Joe Wingfield, 16, accessed his Facebook account via his IPhone and told his brother Richard who is a policeman.

Earlier, Miss Bentley's friends had warned her she was getting herself into trouble. Natalie Salmon wrote: 'Hollie, this is stupid. Why are you even making this event? You might think it's funny but it's not.

'All you are doing is causing trouble and not just for yourself but everybody else. If I was you I would just delete this.'

Several young people targeted were encouraged via various social mediums to loot throughout the UK before posting pictures of their successful looting

But Miss Bentley left the page up and sobbed out an interview about what had happened the following afternoon to Pc Angelina Shute after a night in custody She said: 'I made it. I was joking with my friends. I did not realise the police would get involved. I was just mucking about.

'I did not believe it when the police came around. There is nothing more for me to say except I shouldn't have done it. It was just a joke. I was not really going to do it.'

But Pc Shute asked her: 'Have you seen all the disruption? Have you seen all the property damage? All the police officers that have been injured? All the houses and businesses that have been burned to the ground? People's lives have been put in danger. Is it funny now?'

But the judge agreed after 45 minutes of prosecution evidence there was no case to answer. He rejected the Crown's argument that similar previous cases which resulted in jail terms would have been equally difficult to prove.

The judge maintained those cases were different because the defendants pleaded guilty and could not accept LMFAO referred to Miss Bentley 'sitting in her bedroom, creating this, and laughing inwardly about Wakefield being burned to the ground'.

There were tears from the Bentley family as the judge ordered the jury to acquit her of encouraging violent disorder on Facebook. One said: 'We are just glad it's all over.'

Miss Bentley, who is only about 5ft in height, and dressed all in black, was hugged by her parents Leonard, an ambulance paramedic, and Susan, a hospital cleaner.

The teenager appeared in a daze after the verdict was announced. Mr Bentley said: 'We don't want to talk about it now or ever.'

Hollie, a former pupil of Wakefield's Cathedral School, lives with her parents in a semi-detached house and was charged under the Serious Offences Act 2007.

The court heard there was no Wakey Riot in the end. Miss Bentley told police had lives and businesses been endangered she would have felt 'awful and that it was all my fault'.
