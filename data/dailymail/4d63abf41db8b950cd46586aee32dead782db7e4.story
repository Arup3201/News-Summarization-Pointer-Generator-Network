For almost half a century, a Brazilian man with no medical training has performed surgical procedures to millions of people from all corners of the globe.

João de Deus, or John of God, is a spiritual healer who runs a healing clinic called Casa de Dom Inácio de Loyola, 'The Casa', in a small Brazilian town called Abadiânia.

Millions of people from around the world visit João, 72, for his alternative treatment and next month, the enigmatic figure is visiting Australia for a three day healing and prayer event.

He labels himself a 'psychic surgeon', but John has a wealth of other titles-ranging from 'holy healer' to 'shameless charlatan'. 

Stephen Parnis, Vice President of the Australian Medical Association,  told The Australian he was 'extremely sceptical about this person [João de Deus]; I  find it hard to see any motivation apart from personal profit for him and his organisation.'

The event costs $295 per session but a three session package at a cost of $795 is encouraged for  optimum results.

Influential television host, Oprah Winfrey, vouched for João's spiritual healing powers, after visiting him in 2010, where she nearly fainted during the 'blissful' encounter.

Oprah featured her healing experience in an episode of the Oprah Winfrey Show titled 'Leap of Faith: Meet John of God'.

But despite Oprah's endorsement, João has no shortage of testimonies from others who claim to have been miraculously healed by the 'psychic surgeon'.

Jana Jones, a Sydney based mother, was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis  in 2001, a  disease which carries an average survival rate of three years - which is the time frame Ms Jones was given.

During a follow up trip to another neurologist, Ms Jones got word of a Brazilian man in the jungle with miraculous healing powers - João de Deus.

People seek cures for illnesses at 'The Casa'

Jana Jones, a Sydney based mother, was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in 2001, and was given only three years to live by her doctors

'I researched him as much as I could. In those days there was almost no information about him, but eventually I discovered his name and where he operates.'

In February 2002, Ms Jones flew to Brazil.

'I met with a leade who escorted me to his clinic, 'The Casa'. It was beautiful.'

The following day, João performed a 'visible surgery' on Ms Jones in hopes of curing her of the disease

'He placed a long pair of forceps inside my nose and started sort of moving them around. There was  no antiseptic used.'

Ms Jones says her mouth filled with blood, and João advised not to swallow it. After this, she was taken to an infirmary.

'I had a terrible headache for about a day afterwards, then it was like a veil had been lifted. Suddenly I had all this energy, despite being drained beforehand. I wanted to jump on a roof and scream.'

Ms Jones says she was overwhelmed with 'feelings of love.'

Upon returning to Sydney, a doctor said her condition had  improved dramatically and now, Ms Jones has a much less severe condition called Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy. 

She  visits 'The Casa' at least twice a year.

Howard Toose, who suffered a grave spinal injury in 2006, travelled to Abadiânia in Brazil  in hope of alleviating the constant pain. He said since meeting with João he has seen a drastic improvement in his quality of life, halfing and then quartering the medication he needed to cope with the pain

Another patient of Medium João is Howard Toose, a former Telstra supervisor who suffered a grave spinal injury in 2006.

'I hit my head against a low ceiling extremely hard, causing an abnormal growth in my nervous system canal and it slowly strangled my nervous system.

'I was bedridden after that', he said. 'The pain was so bad I could hardly cope with light or noise - I was hardly ever sleeping from the pain.'

Doctors told Mr Toose, who was confined to a wheelchair, that his condition would never improve.

Like Ms Jones, he got word of João, and decided to travel to the healer's town in hope of alleviating the constant pain.

While travelling to Brazil, Toose suffered excruciating pain. When he reached 'The Casa', Toose was directed to a room full of people in white robes.

'First I received a spiritual blessing then I got the surgery,' he said. 'I was directed to go to a room with elderly people and other patients in wheelchairs - I could feel an incredibly strong energy there, and I knew he was close.'

João arrived to the 'operation room' and told Toose to put his hand on his heart.

'I closed my eyes and he said "In god's name may everyone be healed," I felt these amazing waves of energy on my head - my spine was manipulating inside. 

'After this I was taken to one of the waiting rooms - after years of insomnia, I sunk into the deepest sleep of my life.'

Footage of his surgeries show João scraping the eyes of a patient with what looks like a scalpel.

According to Diego Coppola, João's translator, 'His [João] treatment is a complement to conventional medicine'

João claims he is 'merely an instrument in God's divine hands'

Since meeting with João, Toose has seen a drastic improvement in his quality of life. 

Initially, Toose was able to halve his medication to cope with the pain and now he has been able to quarter the dose.

After witnessing first-hand João's healing abilities, both Toose and Jones have replaced conventional doctors with João's treatment. 

'I am receiving everything I needed from João,' Ms Jones said.

'I've never been back to the doctors' said Toose. 'They gave up on me.' 

John of God's translator Diego Coppola said giving up conventional medicine goes against his teachings.

'John is categorical about stating that everyone must continue to see doctors after the consultations', Mr Coppola said. 

'His treatment is a complement to conventional medicine.'

Coppola said that João is merely a medium, who prays to god to incorporate the spirits that can heal those in need.

'He never claims to heal anyone - it is the spirits that do the work.'

In November, Australians will have the chance to witness João's healing abilities at Sydney Olympic Park in Homebush.  

A spokeswoman for NSW Fair Trading Minister Matthew Mason-Cox said the department will be attending John of God's Sydney healing and prayer ceremony, and will 'closely monitor the event for any potential breaches.'

In the past, Brazilian authorities charged and jailed João for performing medical procedures without a licence. 

John of God will feature on Channel 9's program, 60 minutes, on Sunday night at 7.30pm
