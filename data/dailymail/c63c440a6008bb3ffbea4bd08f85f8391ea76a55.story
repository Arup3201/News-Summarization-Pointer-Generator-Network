An obituary handed out to mourners at a funeral earlier this year shocked family members when the touching eulogy took an unexpected twist and ended on an embittered note accusing the deceased man's descendants of owing him money.

Thurman Winston was just 57 when he died on March 2, his funeral took place a week later and he was buried in Spencer, Oklahoma.

Winston was survived by his wife Rita, his high school sweetheart, their three children, plus two other sons fathered by the deceased and several grandchildren.

A touching eulogy to Thurman Winston of Spencer, Oklahoma, took an unexpected twist as his widow used it to vent her anger at other family members

The no holds barred obituary ended on an embittered note accusing the deceased man's descendants of owing him money

The lengthy obit starts off positive enough describing Winston’s early life and his achievements, but towards the end the tone gets much darker.  

'He has a passion for cars, motorcycles and entertaining family and friends, hunting, fishing and remodeling. His motto: "Accomplish what you can because tomorrow ain't promised".'

‘He stayed busy. He leaves to cherish his memories of his wife, children and grandkids, a host of backstabbing mother f*****s that still owe him money.’

The no holds barred obituary has come to light after a link to it was posted on Reddit under the title ‘I went with my girlfriend to her uncle's funeral and this was in the pamphlet they gave out (read the last sentence).’

The redditor who posted it, Dickbynature, writes that the obit was written by Winston’s widow Rita who was venting her anger at other family members.

The obit reveals that Winston and his wife had three children together – a son Thurwayne and two daughters LaRita and Thurmesha - and were also granted permanent custody of another son Harry. It was later revealed that Winston had had another child prior to his marriage Michael.

In 1980 Winston had moved his family to Texas where he first studied and then worked. Then in 1986 he moved back to Oklahoma 'so his kids could experience the love of their remaining grandparents.'

Winston was described as 'a loving husband and father with a big heart open to everyone.'
