The father-in-law of a missing Utah mother has today said that she would order him to smell her hair and pushed her breasts into his hands as he revealed more details of the sexual relationship he claims they had.

Steve Powell alleges that he enjoyed a 'very sexual' relationship with daughter-in-law Susan Powell who disappeared in December 2009.

Mr Powell said his missing daughter-in-law would frequently make passes at him and that they enjoyed 'sexual touching'.

Mother: Susan Powell went missing from her hom in December 2009 and is now being described as a 'very sexual' person

Explosive claims: Steve Powell said he and his daughter-in-law enjoyed a very sexual relationship and that they were falling in love

'I had a relationship with her that was probably beyond the pale, he told ABC News.

'When she was living at my house she would regularly come into my office after taking a shower.'

He said that she would say to him, 'Smell my hair, I just shampooed it, it smells nice'.

'She would bend over my lap to let me smell her hair or come in and say I "I just waxed my legs, feel my thighs, how smooth they are",' he added.

'One day we were at an animal park with the boys. I was holding Brayden [her son] in my arms, she came over to take him from me and instead of just reaching out and grabbing him, she pushed her breasts against my hand, tightly.'

Mr Powell called his daughter-in-law 'unstable', echoing by claims by his son Josh, who is the only person of interest named in the case.

He told ABC News: 'Susan was very very sexual with me, 
very flirtatious. She would do a lot of things to me, we interacted in a
lot of sexual ways.

'I think it is pretty likely I was falling love with her, and there is no 
doubt in my mind that the feeling was mutual.'

'There was really a disconnect 
between the Susan who was a faithful, loving wife, and the Susan who was
a very flirtatious, sexual being.

'Father-in-law, daughter-in-law 
flirting with each other, maybe some sexual touching or whatever. And I 
enjoyed it, frankly. Susan was a joy to be around in so many ways, not 
just those ways,' he told Good Morning America.

Josh Powell, 34, spoke yesterday as police investigating the disappearance searched the home of he shares with his father-in-law.

He said: 'Everyone who knows me knows that I 
would never hurt her and I would never hurt my boys. I would never hurt anyone.

Emotional: Josh Powell fought back tears as he spoke about his missing wife, saying he was a good husband

'I am a good dad and I was a good 
husband. Though Susan was never unfaithful before that I know of, she 
was a very sexual person.'

He maintains that he left his 
28-year-old wife on her own when he took his two sons Charlie, then 
four, and Braden, then two, camping in the middle of a blizzard in the 
middle of the night, claiming that he simply tends to be 'spontaneous' 
and that the day was a blur to him.

Mr Powell also described his wife as 
an erratic and depressive person who contemplated suicide and would leave
the house in her underwear and walk down the street, a situation he 
calls 'mortifying'.

Steve Powell said his son was unaware of the relationship between he and Susan, saying: 'Josh wasn't aware of a lot of these 
things at first because the first two or three years of his marriage - 
it was really pretty much not something that really came to light.

'We interacted in a lot of sexual ways 
because Susan enjoys doing that.'

After the interview with GMA, Susan's
father Chuck Cox told the network that their claims are 'completely 
false' and 'ridiculous'.

Ridiculous: Chuck Cox said that Steve Powell's claims are completely false and it was him who made passes at his daughter

Speaking about Steve Powell, he said:
'She told us a long time before they moved to Utah that he had made 
advances towards her which she said made her very uncomfortable and that
her husband did not seem to care.

'She moved to Utah to get away from Steve.'

Both Steven and Josh Powell are 
trying to get her journals made public as they believe it illustrates 
that she grew up around emotionally abusive parents and accused her 
father of being a manipulator.

They also said the teenage journals prove that his daughter-in-law is capable of walking out on her husband and their two sons.

Steve Powell has said that the
journals, which stretch back to when Susan was a teenager, show that 
she attempted to commit suicide and was 'lustful', and therefore could 
have run off with another man.

The allegation brought a furious 
response from Susan’s father, Chuck Cox, who said he would fight the release of the pages.

He told ABC News : 'We 
deny all allegations, they are just totally ridiculous and we’re very 
disappointed and believe it’s unconscionable that he would first read 
those journals and then think he had the right to publish them.'

He said: 'They don't have authority to do it. If she is alive, 
which they claim, she then still maintains control over her writings, copyright-wise.

'If they publish it, I'm prepared to take action. I have an attorney and we're waiting.'

The
diary extracts show seven handwritten pages on what appears to be 
school notebook paper, detailing events from Susan's life in 1996 
and 1998.

Steve Powell
said that the documents prove that 'Susan is a lot more vulnerable 
emotionally than Chuck and Judy Cox (her mother) would like people to 
believe'.

Further, the diary extracts show 'that Susan led a double-life from the time she was 13, 14, or possibly even 12,' Mr Powell claimed.

Police widened their search to a network of abandoned mines in Ely, Nevada, but have not revealed any new evidence

The debate comes days after authorities searched a sprawling network of abandoned mines outside Ely, Nevada, but did not reveal any new evidence.

The renewed interest into Susan Powell's disappearance comes after a remembrance rally for her descended into chaos on Friday as family members traded allegations in public.

Chuck Cox has said that he will fight the release of his daughter's diaries

Tensions reached a boiling point between the feuding families as 
loved ones gathered in Puyallup, Washington to pass out flyers and comb 
for leads.

Steve Powell confronted Mr Cox, calling him a 'liar' and a 'cyberbully'.

The families are scheduled to meet in court today when Josh Powell will request a restraining order against Mr Cox.

Mrs Powell was last seen at her home on December 6, 2009.

She was reported missing the next day when she failed to show up for her job in West Valley City, Utah.

Her husband recently told the Salt Lake Tribune that he is willing to talk with federal authorities, but not West Valley City police.

He told the newspaper that he considered the search in Ely an opportunity for authorities to set him up.

'It occurred to me,' he said, according to the paper, 'they were planting something in Ely so they could magically show it to the media.'

The FBI Utah office's spokeswoman, Debbie Dujanovic Bertram, declined to comment yesterday.
