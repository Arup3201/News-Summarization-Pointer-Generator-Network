New double yellow lines painted on the ground in Cambridge are the shortest in Britain at just 11 inches long.

The road markings on Hamilton Road in Chesterton are designed to separate a residents' parking zone with a pay and display area and motorists who park on the lines will face a £50 or £70 fine.

It has taken over the accolade of Britain's shortest double yellow lines from a set also in Cambridge - on Humberside Road - which measure just 13 inches.

But residents and motorists say the markings, which are about the same length as two iPhone 6's, are a 'ridiculous' waste of time and money and branded them 'pathetic'.

Jennie Youce, of Burwell, parked up next to the line and said: 'It is absolutely ridiculous. What a complete waste of time and money. I can't understand why they even bothered with it. It is pathetic.

'And the question is, are they the exact distance between the residents' parking bays and the pay and display signs? Because they look a lot wider than that. 

'I just can't believe they have spent money on this and wasted time. They must have better things to do.'

But Cambridgeshire County Council chiefs have defended painting the lines.

A spokesman said: 'Although we have seen people try and squeeze cars into unusual places such as pedestrians crossings, we don't expect anyone to try and park on these lines. 

Motorists have branded the lines, which are almost a foot-long, as 'pathetic' and a 'waste of time and money'

'This is a genuine attempt to be helpful to motorists by signalling with other signs the divide between pay and display parking and residents' parking on this street.

'The lines mark the border between the two types of parking and aim to help drivers park in the right bays and avoid a fine for parking in the wrong one.' 

Norwich claimed to hold the accolade in 2011 with double yellow lines measuring 17 inches in the city's Stafford Street, while Canterbury in Kent came close with its 21 inch lines.

Meanwhile, nine inch-long double yellow lines appeared in London last year but Westminster City Council vowed to have them removed from Caxton Street

The council admitted the lines were a 'mistake' by contractors and vowed to make sure they were 'corrected', it was reported.
