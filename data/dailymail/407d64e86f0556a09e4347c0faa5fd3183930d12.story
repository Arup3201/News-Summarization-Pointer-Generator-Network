France is pleading for troops from across Europe to bolster its peace-keeping effort in the war-torn Central African Republic.

However, the UK has rejected any on-the-ground intervention to halt the escalating bloodshed between Muslim rebels who ousted president Francois Bozize and Christian militia.

As France’s efforts to control growing violence in its former colony lose support at home after the deaths of two soldiers, its government will this week also urge EU countries to back the establishment of a fund to bankroll support for armies in unstable African countries.

French President Francois Hollande pays tribute at the coffin of a French soldier killed in Bangui, capital of the Central African Republic. France wants its European allies to intervene in the increasingly volatile region

Both proposals, to be discussed at a 
Brussels summit, are being met with scepticism by British officials. 
Senior sources told the Mail: ‘There is no question of British boots on 
the ground. We can offer C17s [military transporter planes], but no 
troops. We want to look at the detail but it is not immediately obvious 
that it is something we would sign up to.’

Ministers
 are wary of committing British troops to military action after the 
embarrassing Commons defeat on taking action over the brutal civil war 
in Syria.

So far, France has deployed 1,600 troops to the country but it wants to boost numbers up to 6,000.

It
 emerged yesterday that dozens of heavily armed rebels surrounded Mr 
Hollande’s plane during a tense stand-off in a visit to Central African 
Republic.

Six vehicles each 
carrying about ten fighters sped up to the  presidential jet as it 
landed at Bangui airport last Tuesday evening, but following 
negotiations no one was hurt. Mr Hollande completed a short visit to 
troops before returning to Paris.

Increasing numbers of people in France are opposed to their Socialist government getting involved in dangerous overseas adventures

President Francois Hollande has already called for the ‘permanent European fund’ for African intervention, and Mr Fabius will push for this at the European Council meeting in Brussels this week.

‘Europe does a lot but it only intervenes from time to time,’ Mr Hollande said last week during a state visit to Brazil.

‘We need a permanent European fund, not a fund for each individual operation. This should not be about us providing the armed forces on the ground and demanding that we be paid. We are neither the mercenaries nor the police of Europe.’

Mr Hollande’s handling of his economy at home is leaping from one disaster to another, leading to accusations that he is using overseas military adventures to try and increase his popularity.

But he insisted:  ‘I did not come to power to make war’, adding that ‘circumstances’ had forced France to launch military operations in Mali and the Central African Republic.

Radical Islam is behind much of the trouble, with an Al Qaeda army trying to seize power in Mali.

The
 killing and maiming of hundreds of British soldiers in countries like 
Afghanistan and Iraq in recent years – combined with the massive cost of
 such wars – will make many of wary of joining the French.
