He was dealt a humiliating blow last week when Britain's coveted AAA credit rating was downgraded.

But if George Osborne was hoping for a better performance away from the office, he'd better steer well clear of the PE hall.

When the Chancellor was last there, he tried his hand at skipping with less than flattering consequences and was even upstaged by a group of primary school pupils.

Embarrassing footage has now emerged of that moment as he tied himself in knots trying to complete as many skips as possible in two minutes.

Ready to go: Chancellor George Osborne prepares to take part in an official competition between MPs to complete as many skips as possible in two minutes during a visit to a primary school

Embarrassing: The video has emerged just days after the Chancellor was dealt a humiliating blow when Britain's coveted AAA credit rating was downgraded

The video, believed to have been taken a few years ago, shows him at a primary school while taking part in an ongoing unofficial competition between MPs.

He starts tentatively and within just a few seconds gets himself in one of many tangles as the children around continue merrily skipping with far more success.

In the end, he manages just 48 skips, even fewer than 65-year-old Ann Widdecombe.

Other unflattering footage shows Deputy 
Prime Minister Nick Clegg and shadow Chancellor Ed Balls taking part 
with a little more success.

More than 100 are currently involved, with a league table showing the Palace of Westminster's best performers.

Conservative MP David Davies currently tops the list, with an impressive 348 skips in the designated time.

Knot his best moment: Within seconds of starting the challenge, Mr Osborne gets his first of many tangles

Ropeless: The chancellor managed just 48 skips in two minutes, fewer even than 65-year-old former Home Office minister Ann Widdecombe

The deputy prime minister ranks in the middle of the list with 152, while the chancellor languishes near the bottom with 48.

Disgraced former MP Chris Huhne is the worst performing MP, managing just 27.

They were both outperformed by Ms Widdecombe, who posted a respectable score of 78 skips.

In one of the videos, released to The Evening Standard, Mr Clegg says he is 'exhausted' by the efforts.

Meanwhile shadow secretary of state for health Andy Burnham joked he would text Mr Balls to taunt him when he beat his score of 138 by four.

The challenge was devised by former boxer John McCormack, who has spent the past seven years persuading people in power to lose their inhibitions and take part.Â

Tangle time: The Chancellor was upstaged by the primary school pupils, who were merrily skipping away as he kept getting the rope snarled up in his legs

He invented a skipping rope which records
the number of rotations, and as well as MPs, has visited more than 
750,000 schoolchildren with his 'skip2bfitter' workshops in an effort to
improve the nation's fitness.

The attempts take place either at local primary schools, or at the Houses of Parliament themselves.

Mr McCormack said he has been amazed at just how many MPs have got involved.

He said: 'Obviously the point in this was to get the children fit. The MPs have been brilliant over the years, yes they may look a little bit silly, but they've nearly all been up for giving it a go to show the children how it's done.

'We've had MPs feel ill, fall over and get ultra competitive. When Andy Burnham did it he said he was going to text Ed Balls to tell him he had beaten his score.

'Ann Widdecombe got the rope and ran around the room with it before the music had even started, beating a lot of the men - even at her age.

'We've had around 100 MPs take part now and they all love it - it's something we'd love the Government help get round schools.'

Not to be outdone: Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls tries his hand at skipping with a bit more success

Revelling in her skipping notoriety, the former Home Office minister told the Standard: 'If you look at some of the people I beat there must be some advantage to being tubby and ancient.'

Britain suffered its first-ever sovereign ratings downgrade from a major agency last Friday when Moody's stripped the country of its coveted triple-A rating.

It was a major blow to Mr Osborne, who had vowed to defend the UK's credit status when the Coalition came to power in 2010.

Moody's said weak prospects for British economic growth, which have thrown the government's deficit reduction strategy off course, lay behind its decision to cut the rating by one notch to Aa1 from Aaa.Austerity has been the watchword for Mr Osborne's fiscal policy.

But a very slow recovery from the financial crisis has pushed back by at least two years the government's goal of largely eliminating the budget deficit by 2015's election.

The Labour Party blames the deficit on too much austerity.
