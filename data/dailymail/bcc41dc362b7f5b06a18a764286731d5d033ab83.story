His wife spent seven years trying to get pregnant - and joy filled the air as she finally gave birth to healthy twins last month in hospital.

But the mood changed fast. Five hours after her Caesarean section in Manhattan, New York, 44-year-old Michal Lura Friedman was dead.

Her distraught husband Jay Snyder, 41, has been left to bring up their twins Jackson and Reverie on his own after the tragedy.

Doctors decided to do a C-section on November 25 - three days ahead of schedule because Ms Friedman had high blood pressure.

After she gave birth to a 6lb girl at 4:48pm and a 7lb 12oz boy at 4:50pm doctors tried to stop her bleeding, reported the New York Daily News.

Mr Snyder sat in another room and desperately prayed for her survival as he looked over his new-born children. But his wife died later at 9:30pm.

'One of the many things that is despicable about this is that she didn’t really even get a chance to hold her kids,’ he told the New York Daily News.

‘They held up the babies to her, she saw them and smiled at me, but she was kind of out of it from the drugs,’ he said, adding she was desperate to be a mother.

The hospital where she was treated, New York University Langone Medical Center, said they send out their ‘deepest sympathies’ to the family.

A medical examiner’s report is being written and the state health department is probing the death, reported the New York Daily News.

Jay Snyder

Mr Snyder, who also uses the name Dan Green, is a voice-over artist known for the Pokemon and Yu-Gi-oh films, and the Tekken and Sonic the Hedgehog video games.

Ms Friedman, a Buddhist originally from South Carolina, was a singer-songwriter and actress also known as ‘Michal the Girl’, reported DNA Info.

The couple first met in Manhattan's 
Greenwich Village; married in Williamsburg, Brooklyn; and recently moved
 to Inwood back in Manhattan.

Proud dad: Michal Lura Friedman had tried for seven years to have a baby, and now she has left her husband Mr Snyder with twins

It is rare for mothers to die in the U.S. while giving birth - but a C-section can raise the low danger.

However just six in 100,000 women who have a planned C-section are expected to die. The rate is 18 in 100,000 for emergency C-sections.

Around one in three births in the U.S. are C-sections, reported the New York Daily News.

Ms Friedman was also a voice-over 
artist - although less well-known than her husband - and had credits on 
Nickelodeon's cartoon Speed Racer.

'Many of you know Michal as a musician, but her greatest dream was to be a mother,' an email to friends and family said, according to DNA Info.

'Here they were struggling to have a baby for years and then all of a sudden they have two gorgeous children,' family friend Greg Abbey said.

Mr Snyder’s relatives and friends are
 now helping him collect donations in an effort to help him bring up the
 children alone without his wife.
