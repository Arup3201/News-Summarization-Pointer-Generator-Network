Chelsea are such a complete team that a video of their weak points only lasts five seconds, according to Steve McClaren.

The Derby County head coach will pit his wits against Jose Mourinho once more in Tuesday night’s Capital One Cup quarter-final clash at the iPro Stadium.

The teams met in the third round of the FA Cup last January with Chelsea winning 2-0 – and McClaren says Mourinho’s team has got significantly better.

The former England manager highlighted the key additions of Nemanja Matic – who arrived that winter window – and Cesc Fabregas.

‘We played them in the FA Cup and it was strong then,’ McClaren said. ‘From a year ago they have improved immensely.

‘Mourinho’s addressed the areas he thought were a problem, up front and then Matic and Fabregas in midfield: so strong mentally and physically.

‘They are so much better. We did a video on the weaknesses on their team and it lasted about five seconds.

‘They have only lost once this season and then they ran out of time (against Newcastle). They are the best team in the Premier League and arguably the best team in Europe.

‘We have to perform at our best to stay in the game and have a chance of achieving our dream result. I want to see how our players perform – have we moved on from a year ago? Because Chelsea have.

‘But they will have to be at their best. Mourinho will respect us and appreciate that. That will reflect in the team he picks. We don’t expect any favours.’
