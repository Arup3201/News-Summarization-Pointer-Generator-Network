It was a coal freighter that overturned in a horrific storm in 1940, sinking, along with the 32 crew aboard, 210 feet below the surface of Lake Michigan, just off the coast of Pentwater.

While the shipwreck of the SS William B. Davock was finally found, upside down, by  divers in 1972, an investigation into why it sank was deemed all but impossible, due to the murkiness of the water.

Until now.

A group of West Michigan-based explorers believe they have determined what caused the Davock to succumb to the 30-foot waves brought on by ferocious blizzard.

Mystery: The SS William B. Davock, a coal freighter built in 1907, sank to the bottom of Lake Michigan on its way to Chicago on November 11, 1940, during a ferocious storm. The reason for its sinking was unknown

Wreck: The ship sits upside down on the shore of Lake Michigan, 210 feet below the surface and just off the coast of Pentwater. Because of the way it sits and the murkiness of the water, investigations weren't possible

The Michigan Shipwreck Research Association (MSRA), a nonprofit underwater archaeological organization, were able to make their way down to the wreck on a clear day last fall.

The dive allowed for the first-known footage of the ship to be taken.

The footage, taken by MSRA diver Jeff Vos, of Holland, showed a broken rudder and snapped propeller blade.

'The waves were so strong, they must have snapped the rudder's connection, at which point it swung so far over that it struck the propeller,' Vos told Michigan Live. 

'With no power or steering, the Davock would have been at the mercy of the storm.'

The Davock had little warning the storm was to hit on November 11, 1940.

With 75 mph winds, 30-foot waves and rain turning to snow, it is still referred to as 'the most disastrous day in the history of Lake Michigan shipping'.

Taking coal to Chicago, the Davock went down five miles out from Little Sable Point between Ludington, Michigan and Pentwater, Michigan.

Another ship, cargo carrier the SS Anna C. Minch, also went down, along with all 24 aboard, while several other ships were damaged and ran aground. 

MSRA board member, Craig Rich, further explained what caused the Davock to sink.

'It would have sent the ship into what we call a shivering mode,' he told MLive.

'Without the rudder, it wouldn't have been able to steer and without the propeller working properly you can't drive it forward. 

'The ship would have gone into the trough of the wave sideways which would have swamped the ship.'

The MSRA was motivated to delve deeper into investigating the Davock after the waters of Lake Michigan started to clear in recent years.

'We decided to give it a shot,' Rich said. 

"The divers didn't even use a light for the discovery. 

'It's not as warm as it is in the Caribbean, but it's certainly starting to rival it in clarity. 

'It was a warm, sunny day. 

'The ambient light was amazing.'
