Bare-legged riders around the globe braved the winter weather and some stares from fellow commuters on Sunday for the No Pants Subway Ride - an annual celebration of freedom, subways - and skivvies.

After events in cities like London and Madrid, North America followed suit, donning just their briefs and boxers in cities like New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Mexico City.

It started off as a prank by comedy group Improv Everywhere that bemused a few embarrassed commuters but has since grown into a global phenomenon.

On the group's website, Improv 
Everywhere said that the only two requirements for participating were a 
willingness to ride the subway without pants and the ability 'to keep a 
straight face about it.'

Despite the threat of snow and bleak 
midwinter temperatures in London, many thrill seekers braved the weather
and took to the London Underground in the UK's own version of the 
event.

Participants behave as if they do not know each other and - other than the lack of trousers - dress appropriately for winter donning hats, scarfs and a warm coat.

The hilarious craze started back in 2002 when a handful of New York pranksters decided to cause a stir on the subway.

One participant entered the train in 
just his underwear for seven consecutive stops and, if asked, were 
instructed to tell people that they 'just forgot' their trousers.

On the 8th stop, a final participant would enter the carriage selling trousers out of a duffel bag - much to the bemusement of other passengers.

The annual event steadily grew each year with more and more people choosing to take part.

But it nearly hit the buffers in 2006 when the stunt was halted by a New York policeman. Eight passengers were handcuffed in their underwear and taken into police custody.

A judge later threw out the case because it is not illegal to wear just your underwear on the Subway.

The No Pants event went global in 2008 with Adelaide in Australia joining eight American cities in taking part in the stunt.

Last year's event saw tens of thousands of people daring to bare their underwear in 59 cities in 27 countries around the world.

In London alone more than 150 took part.

This year Londoners startled fellow passengers on the Picadilly Line. Unlike freezing London participants, those who took part in New York enjoyed a mild winter day, while those who took off their trousers in Sydney basked in balmy summer weather.

Events also took place in cities such as Sofia, Stockholm, Berlin and Beijing.
