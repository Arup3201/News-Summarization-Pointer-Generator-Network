She's been keeping a low-profile in recent months after recuperating from her hip surgery and working on her new album.

And as Lady Gaga starts to build buzz around her upcoming album Artpop and new single, she has been returning to the spotlight... and her flamboyant wardrobe.

As the singer attended a listening party and dinner for her third studio album in Beverly Hills on Thursday, she opted for a structured gold dress.

Creating excitement: Gaga showed some promotional artwork from her new album on her Facebook page

With such a striking dress and matching gold platform boots, Gaga opted for a more natural make-up look than usual.

The New Yorker, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta, completed her outfit with a long gold wig.

Gaga's appearance came the night before she unveiled a new promotional picture from her new album, which will be released as a phone app.

The photo sees Gaga - apparently naked - with an unusual visor covering her face.

Gaga announced on Friday that her new single would be released on August 10, with the album/app following on November 11.

Describing the album, the press release said: 'The app itself is a musical and visual engineering system that combines music, art, fashion and technology with a new interactive worldwide community 'the auras'. Altering the human experience with socal media, we bring ARTculture into POP in a reverse Warholian expedition.

'Exploring Gaga's existence as a cultural interface, the user will share in the 'adrenaline of fame' as they build and share their own projects, chat with one another and watch in real-time on a virtual globe as ARTPOP explodes into the physical and virtual universe at once on November 11, our 'Big Bang'.

'A rage of electronic passion and fury': Gaga has promised fans a very different experience with her new album

'On this day, HAUS OF GAGA venges (sic) with forte to bring the music industry into a new age, an age where art drives pop and the artist once again is in control of the icon.

'In turn, the album ARTPOP musically mirrors Gaga's creative process as she passes through the mediums of each artist she collaborates with, scoring a blueprint of her journey. The result, a 'rage' of electronic passion and fury, defining each artistic process from beginning to end, Artpop could mean anything. But for her, this is a celebration of obsession.'

Going for gold: Despite its eye-catching colour, Gaga's outfit was relatively tame in comparison to others she's worn

Gaga's Facebook posting comes after she has given herself a self-imposed Twitter ban since June 26.

The profile photo and backdrop has been removed and replaced with the standard Twitter egg icon.

However, it is believed Gaga will return to Twitter once her single comes out next month.
