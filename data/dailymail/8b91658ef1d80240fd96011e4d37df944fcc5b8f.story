The Queen will make a two-day visit to 
Northern Ireland as part of her Diamond Jubilee tour of the UK on June 26 and 27.

Accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh she will travel to Belfast and the Enniskillen, County Fermanagh,  where eleven people were killed on November 8 1987 when an IRA bomb exploded.

First minister Peter Robinson welcomed confirmation of the royal visit, while deputy First Minister, and former IRA commander  Martin McGuinness expressed interest in a meeting with the British Monarch.

Flashback: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh in Northern Ireland during her Silver Jubilee tour in 1977

At the height of the troubles in 
Northern Ireland the Queen visited Ulster during her Silver Jubilee tour
in 1977, she also visited during her Golden Jubilee year in 2002 and made an historic visit to the Republic of Ireland last year.

Buckingham Palace said: 'As previously announced, the Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, will visit Northern Ireland as part of the Diamond Jubilee tour of the United Kingdom.

'Her Majesty and His Royal Highness will visit Enniskillen and Belfast on June 26 and 27. Further details of the programme will be confirmed in due course.'

The peace process in Northern Ireland has seen normality return to the streets of Belfast and across the province during the past decade.

While in Dublin she laid a wreath at the
Republic’s Garden of Remembrance - dedicated to all those who fought 
for Irish independence from Britain.

Northern Ireland's first minister Peter Robinson and his deputy Martin McGuinness will both potentially meet with the Queen

First minister Peter Robinson welcomed news of the royal visit. 'It is also a sign of progress that Buckingham Palace has been able to give advance notice of the two day visit

'In the past, only a select few got to greet Her Majesty The Queen and most people would have been unaware that a visit was even taking place.

'This change in protocol will give people a great opportunity to demonstrate their fondness and admiration for Her Majesty by coming onto the streets to welcome her. This is testimony to the changed times in which we live,' He told the BBC.

Speaking at a Dublin conference last month to mark the success of the peace process, Mr McGuinness said he would not be found wanting when compromises needed to be made.

Asked about a possible meeting with the Queen, he said: 'It’s making clear that the enormous progress that’s been made in recent times has been made because politicians have been prepared to compromise.

“Compromise to me in the peace process is never a dirty word. There are big challenges ahead for all of us. Not just for me, but others in the process. We all have to be big enough to rise to these challenges. Am I big enough to rise to these challenges? Absolutely. My track record shows that’s the case.'

As part of the celebrations during the four-day Diamond Jubilee weekend, beacons will be lit across the country on Monday evening.

Carrickfergus in Northern Ireland has been chosen as the site where the first beacon in the UK will be lit, one of 51 across the province.
