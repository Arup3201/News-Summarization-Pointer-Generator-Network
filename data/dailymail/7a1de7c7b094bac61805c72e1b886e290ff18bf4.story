A jilted husband who stabbed his estranged wife to death using a knife they were given as a wedding gift has been jailed for at least 25 years.

Ty Medland, 26, from Peacehaven in East Sussex, armed himself with four knives from the wedding set before launching the 'frenzied and savage' attack on his wife Samantha Medland in central Brighton.

A trial at Lewes Crown Court had heard Samantha had rebuffed her husband's attempts to patch up their marriage and had become close to another man.

Guilty: Jilted husband Ty Medland, 26, left, will spend at least 25 years behind bars for stabbing to death his estranged wife Samantha Medland, 24, seen right

Medland knifed his wife to death in Brighton's Queen Square after she met him close to where she worked to collect some of her belongings on February 17.

Described in court as a 'self-centred' and 'petulant' man incapable of dealing with rejection, Medland had posted links to graphic photographs and videos of the couple having sex on his Facebook page prior to the attack.

He added a message referring to Mrs Medland as 'the cheating, lying, unloyal whore who 
destroyed everything I loved and believe in'.

He had admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, but was convicted of Mrs Medland's murder on Friday.

It was described by the judge as 'the most ghastly killing'.
