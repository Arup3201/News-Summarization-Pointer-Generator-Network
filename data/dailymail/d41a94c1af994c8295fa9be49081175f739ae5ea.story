While a close encounter with a shark strikes fear into the heart of any fishermen, the last thing these kayakers wanted to experience was a real life scene taken straight from the film Jaws.

Shocking footage has emerged of two kayakers from the United States who got a bit too close for comfort when they dropped a GoPro into the water to film the hammerhead.

Mark Naumovitz, from Port St. Lucie and Brian Nelli, from Palm Beach Gardens, were fishing off the shore of Palm Beach Florida when they spotted the four metre shark last Friday.

‘It's not really a huge thing to see sharks,’ Naumovitz told WPTV.

‘But when you have a dorsal fin trailing you like its Jaws, it's a different story.’

The pair was stalked relentlessly as they watched in horror while it circled the boat at least 30 times for more three kilometres.

The underwater camera captured the animal as it bumped into the plastic vessel more than once while the two fishermen desperately paddled their way back to shore.

‘It freaked me out a little,’ Nelli told WPTV.

‘I was reminding myself there was a shark in the water and not to fall out.

Nelli told WPTV that he saw the shark inching toward the tail of his kayak when wind began to pick up, which made the water choppy.

'He may have picked up scent and followed us,' Naumovitz said.

Despite the frightening encounter, the dreaded jaws was seen circling the boat before disappearing into the deep blue sea.
