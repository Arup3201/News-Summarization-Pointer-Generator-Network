Unlike most romantic proposals, Rochelle Collis wasn't wooed with a ring, instead Mr Moini surprised her and the guests, with a $1 million donation to charity - she said yes

It was the awfully romantic philanthropy gesture that had entrepreneur Babak Moini 'walking through the streets with a spring in his step.'

On his partner's 40th birthday, Mr Moini, the founder of a chain of laser clinics, announced in front of a crowd of guests at the couple's Sydney home, 'Rochelle, I'd like you to change your Facebook status to "engaged"'.

Unlike most romantic proposals, Rochelle Collis wasn't wooed with a ring, instead Mr Moini surprised her and the guests, with a $1 million donation to charity - she said yes.

In lieu of birthday gifts, Ms Collis asked her guests to donate to a charity of her choice, the FSHD Global Research Foundation.

The surprise proposal came to a shock for everyone at the birthday party, besides the recipients of the donation, Natalie Moss and her father Bill, who suffers from facioscapulohumeral dystrophy.

'We had the biggest novelty cheque you'll ever see,' Ms Moss told Sydney Morning Herald.

'It was a beautiful birthday celebration for her, she was speechless.'

But Mr Moini's generous gesture was not about the couple, rather his way highlight the need for philanthropy in Australia "and saying no to excess wealth".

'I was going to spend about $10 to $15 million buying a house and it just didn't feel right to me,' he said. 'I thought I would rather give the money away.'

The couple met when Ms Collis was supplying botox and fillers to his clinics, and now they plan on setting up a foundation that will see them donate $3 million a year to charity.

Mr Moini, father-of-three from a previous marriage, believes too many people wait until they are dead to give away their wealth.

Ms Moss predicts that many Australians are hesitant to donate because they tend to associate the word "charity" with dirty.

'I don't think Australians believe in charity, I think charity's a dirty word. People don't believe that the dollar goes to the cause.'

So Ms Moss and her father, the former Macquarie Bank executive set up an app so donors can see that their money is going towards research.

'What we've tried to do from day one is show the transparency and accountability,' Ms Moss said.

As for Mr Moini's next donation, he plans on making sure all of his money is spent purely on medical research.

'Rochelle's sister suffers from multiple sclerosis and I would like to make a large donation to them, he said.

'I haven't spoken to them but I am sure they will contact me after you write this.'
