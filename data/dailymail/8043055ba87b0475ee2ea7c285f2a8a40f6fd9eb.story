Many people may not have heard of Jo Pavey before she struck gold at this month's European Championships.

But athletics fans know the Exeter-based athlete has put in years of training to finally achieve a major title. And to her own surprise, victory has come when she's least expected it. 

She told MailOnline: 'I'm really chuffed. I have been trying to get a gold medal for so many years at a championships so to finally achieve it at the age of 40 with two young children is quite funny in some ways. Years ago I would never had thought this would be the circumstances in which I achieve a gold medal.'

Life begins at 40: Jo Pavey became the oldest European champion in history when she won the 10k this month

Jo has been a successful runner from a young age, winning English School titles after her P.E. teacher spotted her talent and recommended she join her local running club. 

She trained and worked as a physiotherapist in the nineties before deciding to pursue a full-time career in athletics. Since then, she has been to four Olympics and won silver and bronze European and Commonwealth medals. But she adds that her dream was to get that 'elusive gold'. 

It was winning gold that has kept her motivated to train after becoming a mother to Jacob, five, and Emily, who will be one in September, with husband Gavin - who is also her coach and manager. 

After she gave birth to Emily last September, Jo said she gradually returned to training but wasn't sure if she would be able to return to form in time to qualify for this summer's European Champs and Commonwealth Games. 

Team effort: Jo said she couldn't have won the gold without the support of husband Gavin, right, who helps her juggle training with being a mother to their children Jacob and Emily 

She said: 'When I was pregnant I carried on jogging but I didn't do any hard running and I wore a heart rate monitor at all times. After I had Emily I took my time getting back into training as I just wanted to enjoy having a newborn. I carried on breastfeeding until April so in the early stages I just fit in what training I could around her. 

'When I got back into track sessions earlier this year my times were nowhere near what I needed to achieve so I thought it would be unrealistic for me to try and make the GB team this summer. The trial for the European 10k was in May and I really felt up against it. But I just kept working away and I qualified.'

She qualified in style, beating athletes half her years and proving age and motherhood is no barrier to sporting success.

As well as going on to win the European title over 10k - making her the oldest champion in the event's 80-year history - she also took a bronze at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games over 5k, roared on by the British crowd.

Jo said she hopes her success inspires other people not to give up on their dreams.

'I think because I'm still able to enjoy it, I am still able to run well,' she explained. 'I think some people retire too early from sport. I've been pleasantly surprised in training at what I can still achieve and haven't noticed a reduction in speed. I can still be competitive. So I say to other people get out there and enjoy it, you're not over the hill yet!'

She certainly doesn't have any plans for retirement herself just yet. Other races this year will include taking part in the IAAF Continental Cup in Morocco in September and doing a half marathon in the Autumn.

Battling to bronze at the Commonwealth Games: Jo thinks being a mother has improved her endurance 

She said she would love to do another marathon in the future with the aim of lowering her 2 hour 28 minute Personal Best time set in 2011.

The Rio Olympics in 2016 remains 'a realistic possibility' but she'll decide nearer the time whether to target the 5k, 10k or marathon distance.

As a mother-of-two, Jo said fitting in her 100-mile-a-week training requires being flexible and she and Gavin always ensure their children's needs come first. 

She said: 'I'm lucky that I have a supportive husband and it's very much a team effort. Gavin is also my coach and manager and he looks after the children while I'm training. 

'Sometimes I will train on my own or on other days they will all come with me to the track or the forest. 

'We fit the training in around the kids' needs because being a mum is my priority.' 

Jo added that she thinks being a mother is one of the secrets to her recent success.

'I think it has done me good because now I don't stress about training like I did when I was younger. All I did then was eat, sleep, train,' she said. 

'Now I don't stress about my training, I train harder than ever but I don't worry if I'm not hitting my targets. 

'I am so happy because I have two lovely children and a supportive husband. Being happy gives me a lot of motivation and being busy as a mum has given me more endurance in a lot of ways.'

As well as training and racing, Jo is also currently working as an ambassador for the charity Dreams Come True, who fulfil the wishes of seriously and terminally ill children.

Jo said: 'I am honoured to promote the charity and give advice to their runners who are doing races like the London Marathon to raise money for them. 

'The charity is close to my heart being a mum. Given what the children are going through, it’s so important to find ways to make their lives better.'
