British Gas, which is about to hit families with big price rises, has been shamed with a record fine of £2.5million for failing customers.

The country’s biggest energy firm, with 13million customers, mishandled complaints and left people in the dark about how to get help.

The fine, the largest ever imposed by industry regulator Ofgem, is hugely embarrassing for a company which has launched several initiatives to overcome a well-earned reputation for poor customer service.

Fined: British Gas's £2.5 million bill is the largest fine ever imposed for customer-service failings

Ofgem said British Gas had failed to re-open cases when customers indicated their complaint had not been resolved.

The firm also failed to provide key information about how people could pursue complaints with the independent Energy Ombudsman.

The
ruling confirms concerns raised by Money Mail, whose readers gave 
British Gas a wooden spoon for customer service last year. The failures 
at British Gas were revealed as the company prepares to hit customers 
with an 18 per cent increase in gas tariffs and 11 per cent on 
electricity.

The company 
made a record profit of £742million last year, while those for its 
parent company Centrica soared by almost a third to £2.4billion.

As
a result, chief executive Phil Bentley collected almost £1.3million, 
including a bonus of £621,000. Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw was 
paid £2.3million.

Figures announced today, covering the
first six months of the current financial year, are expected to show 
that profits were down for the winter period but still sizeable, with 
Centrica at around £1.3billion and British Gas £293million.

Ofgem executive Sarah Harrison said 
the fine was designed to highlight ‘basic failures’ in customer service.
She said it was part of a new ‘get tough’ approach to regulation.

‘As well as household customers, small businesses have received poor customer service from suppliers.

‘This fine must be part of a significant overhaul of the energy market. Most of the big six energy companies are under investigation for one form of poor practice.’

Executive director at Which?, Richard Lloyd, said: ‘Suppliers should always tell customers that they can take an unresolved complaint to the Energy Ombudsman.

‘It’s well worth people pursuing this as the majority of complaints assessed by the Ombudsman are upheld, and seven in ten include financial compensation.’

British Gas described the fine as ‘totally disproportionate’. It claimed the problems were limited to a small group of micro-businesses.
