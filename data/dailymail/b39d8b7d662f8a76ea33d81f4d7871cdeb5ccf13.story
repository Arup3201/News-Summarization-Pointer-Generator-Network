This is the moment a 'worse for wear' student was attacked by a 'hugger mugger' who squeezed his throat until he lost consciousness before stealing his  £5,000 Rolex.

The 24-year-old had been on a night out in central London when his attacker began talking to him about martial arts and acting out restraint moves.

As the student turned around, the attacker suddenly put his arm across his throat and squeezed, causing the victim’s legs to crumple as he passed out briefly and fell to the ground.

The suspect then ripped the victim’s 
watch, a £5,000 Rolex Submariner with a silver bracelet and black face, 
off his wrist and fled.

Detectives investigating the attack have today released CCTV footage of the incident, which happened near Regents Street, in an attempt to track down the suspect, who they described as a 'hugger mugger'.

'The suspect targeted his victim carefully, choosing someone who was a bit the worse for wear after a night out, alone and smartly dressed,' said Investigating officer Detective constable Michael Heaney.

'The method he uses is not something we have seen before in this area and is a concern.

'Had the suspect applied more pressure the victim could have been far more seriously injured.

'As it was, he was just badly shaken.'

Dc Heaney is appealing for witnesses to the incident which happened near Regents Street, at around 3.35am on Saturday May 10.

Scotland Yard said the attacker told the victim he was Algerian.

He was wearing a dark baseball-type jacket, dark blue jeans and a black baseball cap, and was described as bald with stubble, 5ft 8ins and of muscular build.
