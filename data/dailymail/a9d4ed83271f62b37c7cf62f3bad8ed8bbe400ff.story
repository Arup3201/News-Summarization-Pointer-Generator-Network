Looking for a Valentine's Day gift outside of the chocolate box?

The Bronx Zoo in New York is offering quirky romantics the opportunity to name a Madagascar Hissing cockroach after a loved one.

For $10, purchasers of the unusual love token will receive a gift certificate to print out and present to their beloved over candlelight. 

'Flowers wilt, candlelight fades, roaches are forever,' a message on the card reads. 

Thinking outside the chocolate box: The Bronx Zoo in New York is offering hapless romantics the opportunity to name a Madagascar Hissing cockroach after a loved one this Valentine's Day 

The name-a-roach program at the park was first launched in 2011.

Apparently people are still coming out of the woodwork to participate.

The zoo said Monday that thousands of 'hopeless' - or perhaps hapless - romantics have taken advantage of the strange sweetheart deal. 

The $10 goes to the Wildlife Conservation Society, which has worked in Madagascar since 1990 to help to protect its coastal, marine, and dry forests.

The zoo's website features a jarring glamour shot - a two-inch-wide roach image, resplendent amid a bed of rose petals.

Invasion: The Bronx Zoo has more than 58,000 Madagascar hissing cockroaches on their premises

Among the selling points: the creature's 'surprisingly high tolerance for radiation.'

The headline states: 'Seal it with a hiss.' 

The Bronx Zoo has more than 58,000 Madagascar hissing cockroaches on its premises.

The live hissing cockroaches are on display in the zoo's Madagascar! exhibit.

Their hiss is 90 decibels - the equivalent to the sound made by a lawnmower or hair dryer. 

This species of cockroach can live two to five years with their diet consisting of  leaf litter and fallen fruit.
