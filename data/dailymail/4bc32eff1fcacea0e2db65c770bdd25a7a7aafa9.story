A Labour MP is to repay expenses after claiming the cost of a poppy wreath to honour the war dead on Remembrance Day.

Sarah Champion admitted the claim 'should never have been made' and will return the £17 to the expenses watchdog this week.

The MP, who was the star of a documentary about life in the Commons, billed the taxpayer for the tribute last November.

According to official releases from the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, Miss Champion submitted the claim for 'Wreath for Remembrance Sunday', describing it as 'necessary expenses to 11/11/14'.

IPSA paid the £17, despite MPs being banned from claiming for wreaths.

Miss Champion was elected as MP for Rotherham in 2012 after Labour's Denis Macshane quit before being jailed over his expenses.

The revelation about the wreath is embarrassing for an MP who has built a reputation for railing against the Westminster Establishment.

Andy Silvester, from the Taxpayers' Alliance, told The Sun: 'Trying to put the bill on somebody else to honour our servicemen and women is downright low.

'And then IPSA approving it shows just how out of touch this monster of a quango is.'

Miss Champion told the newspaper: 'The claim should never have been made so I'll reimburse IPSA on Monday.'

When details of MPs' expense claims were leaked in 2009, it emerged a number of senior politicians had claimed taxpayers' money to pay for wreaths.

Labour's Ed Balls put in claims for two wreaths worth £33 in August 2007, but the Commons fees office wrote back stating that the Commons department of finance and administration 'disallows costs relating to wreaths and other related expenses'.

Tory Boris Johnson and former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy also claimed for the cost of a Remembrance wreath.

An IPSA spokesman said: 'We publish all details of what has happened and also what MPs claim. In this case, we will be seeking a repayment from the MP.'
