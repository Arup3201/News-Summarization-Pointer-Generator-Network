The homeless, shoeless beggar who was catapulted to worldwide fame after a photograph of him went viral online has a history of arrests and it's revealed he is not actually homeless.

Jeffrey Hillman whose arrest history includes harassment, criminal mischief, public masturbation, grand larceny and assault, has a federally funded apartment in the Bronx despite found on the streets on a cold New York night.

Hillman, 54, became famous on the internet after a moving photograph captured him receiving a pair of shoes by a concerned police officer. The photograph was shared by hundreds of thousands of people around the world within a couple of days after the New York City Police Department posted it online.

The New York Times tracked down Hillman, who is again shoeless, despite the good deed

But despite his homeless lifestyle, 
the federal government has paid for and provided an apartment for 
Hillman in Veteran Affairs Supportive Housing since 2011 in upper 
Manhattan.

'Just because he has an apartment 
doesn't mean our work is done with him,' NYC Commissioner of Homeless 
Services Seth Diamond told USA Today. 'He is not dressed for the 
weather, he is not engaged in a healthy lifestyle, and he is not leading
a productive life.'

Mr Diamond says Hillman has been receiving help from his department since 2009, first living in transitional housing sites called Safe Havens before deemed stable enough to be given a private apartment in 2011.

But Mr Diamond says he doesn't always accept his department's help.

'Sometimes he appears to be receptive and other times less so. We never give up,' he said. 'Housing is an important first step that builds the foundation, but there is more that needs to be done.'

Throughout his time in city, originally from New Jersey, Hillman was most most recently busted in New York City in 2008 for possession of a controlled substance, according to the New York Post.

He had a similar drug bust in 2003 
and a slew of charges in 2002 for harassment, menacing, criminal 
mischief, reckless endangerment, possession of stolen property and 
resisting arrest.

Hero: Mr DePrimo has gained instant fame for his selfless act, but insists he was just doing his duty

In 1998, he was arrested for public lewdness after allegedly masturbating in front of numerous people in Hamilton Heights. Two years later, he was picked up on charges of forgery, grand larceny and criminal possession.

Hillman’s family in Allentown, Pennsylvania said they haven't heard from him since his sudden fame.

But the homeless man says he cannot 
even wear his new shoes for fear they could be stolen - or even get him 
killed by an envious fellow beggar.

And his sudden celebrity has 
apparently done little to improve his prospects, as he continues to 
panhandle on the streets of New York and complains, 'I want a piece of 
the pie' from the touching photograph.

Mr Hillman's fame stems from an image
of NYPD officer Lawrence DePrimo handing him a new pair of $100 boots 
after finding him sitting barefoot and desolate on the street in Times 
Square.

Gift: But Mr Hillman says he cannot wear his new $100 boots for fear he will be robbed or even killed over them

The photograph was featured on 
numerous news sites, and captured the hearts of millions as a symbol of 
unfeigned generosity and a public servant going beyond the call of duty.

But when the New York Times tracked down the recipient yesterday, he claimed he had not benefited from his newfound recognition.

The
Times revealed that Mr Hillman is a 54-year-old veteran who has lived 
on the streets of Manhattan for the best part of a decade.

He grew up in South Plainfield, New Jersey, and after high school he signed up to the Army in 1978.

After being honorably discharged from the military, he worked in catering in his home state - and he says he does not know how he ended up homeless.

Family: Mr Hillman's brother Kirk and sister-in-law Tish say they hear from him around once a year

He told the paper he remembered his 
meeting with Mr DePrimo and said he was grateful for the officer's gift,
adding: 'I wish there were more people like him in the world.'

But
during his interview with the Times he was once again barefoot, saying:
'Those shoes are hidden. They are worth a lot of money. I could lose my
life.'

Mr Hillman also suggested that he should gain financially from the furore surrounding the viral image: 'I was put on YouTube, I was put on everything without permission. What do I get?'

He added, 'This went around the world, and I want a piece of the pie.'

However, he also took the time to thank those who had taken an interest in him, saying, 'It meant a lot to me.'

Earlier it was revealed that his family had no idea he was living on the streets, as his sister-in-law Tish said she and her husband heard from him only around once a year.

The panhandler also two children, 24-year-old Jeffrey Jr and Nikita, 22, but he is no longer in regular contact with them.
