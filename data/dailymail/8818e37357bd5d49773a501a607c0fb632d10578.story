A teenager  fighting for Islamic State in Syria bragged about passing through Belgian airport security  'like a knife through butter' a week before last night's terror raids which killed two.

A fighter by the name of Abu Mariya Belgiki branded the Belgian security service 'probably the dumbest in the world' last Friday, in the midst of the Charlie Hebdo attacks, after he was waved through security at Brussels airport.

Later the same day he posted again, praising the Paris attackers, before asking: 'What are the brothers in Belgium waiting for?'

Last night armed Belgian police killed two suspected jihadis and arrested a third after a shoot-out in the eastern city of Verviers, with offices saying they had prevented 'a second Paris'.

A Belgian teen calling himself Abu Mariya Belgiki (pictured), who has been fighting for Islamic State, mocked the Belgian security services a week before yesterday's shoot-out between jihadis and police

Six days before Belgian security forces killed two jihadis and arrested a third, and in the midst of the Paris terror attacks, Abu Mariya posted this taunting message about passing through Brussels airport security

Investigators believe the men, who were armed with machine guns and pistols, were part of a cell planning to attack police 'on a grand scale'.

But just six days previously, while the Kouachi brothers were still on the run in France having shot 12 people dead, Abu Mariya made his chilling boast.

In tweets supplied to Mail Online by research group MEMRI, he said: 'Don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, but Belgian intelligence agency is the laziest and the dumbest in the world probably…

'They kept me under surveillance since I was 14. And I passed through Brussels airport like a knife cutting through soft butter…'

Later the same day he took to Twitter once more, this time writing about the moment his ISIS superior told him about the Paris terror attacks.

He wrote: 'Was going to bed yesterday, my ameer [leader] yells and says, "France, France, you know France?" I said yes its south of Belgium. He said "Yes I know."

'He said 'Ikhwa [brothers] did operation there and killed 12'. I was like whooaaaaa what are the ikhwa in Belgium waiting for…: )'

Armed police carrying out a terror raid in a flat above a bakery in Verviers got into a shoot-out with suspected jihadi fighters yesterday, saying they were armed with military weapons and handguns

The Belgian state prosecutor said the men were thought to be part of a cell preparing to carry out 'large scale attacks' against police and security forces

It is not known whether Abu Mariya was one of those who engaged police in a bloody firefight late yesterday evening.

Abu Mariya Belgiki is not believed to be his real name, but rather an Arabic nom de guerre he took on after going to fight. Belgiki means Belgium in Arabic.

In one post from Syria, he included an image of himself wearing a scruffy leather jacket and jeans, while sitting cross-legged on the ground with a short-stock AK 47 rifle resting in his lap.

A message under the image read: 'From a life under oppression to hayat [life] under the raya [flag] of tawheed [oneness, referring to the black and white ISIS flag]'

On the same day Abu Mariya tweeted about Brussels airport, he also posted this chilling message praising the Paris attackers, and asking: 'What are the ikhwa [brothers] in Belgium waiting for?'

He also speaks about his life fighting for ISIS, complaining about coalition airstrikes and bragging about getting hold of American automatic rifles.

In one post on January 5, just days before his apparent return to Belgium, he wrote: 'Making Wudu [prayer], jets …hanging clothes in the sun, jets… playing with cats in the garden, jets... urghhh.'

In another tweet on the same day he added: 'So funny reading US PROPERTY on our m16's.'

He also spoke about life in Islamic State's so-called Caliphate, discussing a hierarchy among fighters, with those from the Arabian Peninsula and Jordan being given the most rights.

Posting in Flemish he also recounted meeting a 16-year-old Dutch boy in the street, and said English is a commonly used language among the jihadis.

In a final note on January 9, shortly before his account was taken offline, he seems to suggest that ISIS are planning an attack in Egypt.

The badly-spelled message said: 'Soon u will here wonderful news from the land of Egypt... we are coming to shake the throne of Sisi.'

The throne of Sisi is though to refer to the current Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.

Last night's shootings in Belgium occurred as the country's military  carried out raids on a dozen homes across the country, including one above a bakery, which may have triggered the gun battle.

Two suspected jihadis were killed in the firefight. A third man, said to be seriously wounded, was last night in police custody, along with six other suspects.

Officials last night said Belgium had raised the threat of terror attacks to its highest level.

Federal prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt confirmed that an active terror cell had been about to launch ‘attacks on a grand scale’.

He added: ‘The suspects immediately and for several minutes opened fire with military weaponry and handguns on the special units of the federal police before they were neutralised.’

The shooting took place near a railway station in the town of Verviers, near Belgium’s eastern border with Germany.

A resident told Belgian TV: ‘I heard two explosions and saw two young men run away. They were between 25 and 30 years, [and] of Arab origin.’

Around 300 jihadi fighters have left Belgium, which has a large Muslim population, to fight for ISIS in Iraq and Syria.

This is the largest proportion of any country in the EU, with the exception of the UK, according to news service Radio Free Liberty Radio Europe.
