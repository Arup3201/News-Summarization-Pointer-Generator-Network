A schoolboy who was teased when he failed to light a fire on a Scout trip decided to build one in his garden - and sparked a £10,000 blaze which left him in hospital.

Edward Hawkins, 14, hoped to prove himself to his friends by stacking up wood in the garden of his family home in Wainscott, Kent, and dousing it with petrol as his mother took his brother to school.

Armed with a camera phone to capture the moment, he put a match to the pile but watched in horror as flames leapt onto spread to his father, Eddie’s, shed.

Aftermath: Edward Hawkins was treated at the specialist burns unit at the Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead after burning himself in a fire he set

It contained two explosive gas canisters, and as Edward frantically tried to empty it, a petrol can exploded, soaking him as he stamped down the flames.

The fire spread up from his feet, engulfing his clothes and body before blistering his hands and face.

The schoolboy tried to put out the flames by rolling on the ground as neighbours raced to throw wet blankets over him and called emergency services.

Edward was taken to hospital suffering superficial burns to his face, and is now waiting to hear if he will need a skin graft for a bad burn to his thumb.

The fire wrecked the home-made shed where site manager Mr Hawkins, 48, kept his expensive tools and garden equipment, causing £10,000 damage.

Scout Edward Hawkins, 14, built a large fire in his parents' garden in Wainscott, Kent, but ended up in hospital with severe burns

Edward said: 'I just remember thinking, I need to put out the fire and I need to get the tools and gas out of the shed.

'Apparently I was shouting, but I couldn’t feel anything, I was just panicking and didn’t realise how badly I was burnt.'

Neighbour Len Cracknell, 74, said he heard Edward shouting 'Help me, help, I’m on fire' and called the fire brigade.

The schoolboy's mother, Carol, 49, a party planner, said: 'I abandoned my car and sprinted up the road, screaming for Edward.

'The first I saw him he was on a 
stretcher ready to be wheeled all the way down the road to the ambulance
 because it couldn’t get to the house.

'I was so frightened, I felt like I was going to collapse. All I could hear was Edward saying ‘Mummy, help me, please help me’.'

She added: 'This all came about because those Scouts teased him when he couldn’t get his fire going.

'He just wanted to show them he could light one, bless him. Unfortunately I think he went a bit too far.

'The firefighters said to us the two gas canisters still in the shed were seconds off exploding from the heat and if they had, Edward might not be here today.

'To be honest, Edward wasn’t thinking about himself, he was more worried about how angry his dad would be that the outhouse he built from scratch, and all his tools, had been destroyed.

Up in smoke: The wooden shed, hand-built by Edward's father, contained tools worth £10,000

Edward was badly burnt as he tried to save the contents of the shed, and may need a skin graft on his thumb

Edward's mother, Carol, 49, said she sprinted to the house to see her son being carried out on a stretcher

'But at the end of the day they’re replaceable, my son isn’t and I’m just so happy and relieved that he is alive.'

Firefighters were delayed in tackling the blaze because double-parking in the Hawkins' cul-de-sac

prevented them from getting their vehicles near enough, forcing them to lay out hoses first.

Edward was taken to Medway Maritime Hospital, before being transferred to the specialist burns unit at the Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead.

Doctors say the burns on his face are likely to heal, but he may need a skin graft on a bad burn to his thumb.

Edward is a member of the 27th All Saints Frindsbury Scout troop. Assistant Scout leader Derek King refused to comment today.

Scouts work towards a variety of badges, two of which involve learning about fire safety.

The Camper Activity badge is awarded to Scouts who can demonstrate their ability in a variety of camping skills, one of which is constructing an 'altar fire', ie one on top of a trestle-table shaped construction.

Scouts aiming for the Fire Safety Skill badge must learn about 'the dangers of fires at camp and what precautions should be taken', as well as how to act if fire breaks out.  They must also know how to deal with a person whose clothes are on fire.
