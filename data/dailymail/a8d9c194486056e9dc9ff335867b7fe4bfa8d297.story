It is considered the villain of the animal kingdom - a pilferer obsessed with stealing trinkets.

But it appears the magpie has been unfairly maligned all along.

For despite its centuries-old reputation, new research suggests that the bird is not attracted to shiny objects after all. 

In fact, as animal psychologists have discovered, magpies are actually quite repelled by unfamiliar items.

Psychologists from the University of Exeter discovered that, contrary to popular belief, magpies (stock image pictured) are actually frightened of new and unfamiliar objects, rather than attracted to them

The idea of the magpie as a pilferer that steals sparkly items for its nest is a common theme in European folklore.

Rossini made it the theme of his 1817 opera The Thieving Magpie, in which a servant girl is executed for stealing silver jewellery that had been pinched by a bird.

Suspicion of the bird is common in folklore and myth. 

In western Europe and North America magpies are often thought to be bearers of bad omens, and associated with the devil. 

Negative connotations surrounding magpies can be traced back to Shakespeare, when their 'chattering' was referenced, and moaned about.

Other myths claim the birds were the only ones not to join Noah on the ark. 

Superstitious people will often salute and greet a magpie to avoid experiencing bad luck. 

The Tintin comic ‘The Castafiore Emerald’ has a similar plot, in which a prized emerald stolen by a magpie.

But scientists at the University of Exeter have now debunked the myth, proving that magpies are not the flighty thieves we thought they were.

The researchers carried out a series of tests on wild magpies and a group of the birds housed at a rescue centre.

Under carefully controlled conditions, they were exposed to both shiny and non-shiny items and their reactions recorded.

Lead researcher Dr Toni Shephard, from the university’s Centre for Research in Animal Behaviour, said: ‘We did not find evidence of an unconditional attraction to shiny objects in magpies.

‘Instead, all objects prompted responses indicating neophobia - fear of new things. 

‘We suggest that humans notice when magpies occasionally pick up shiny objects because they believe the birds find them attractive, while it goes unnoticed when magpies interact with less eye-catching items.

‘It seems likely, therefore, that the folklore surrounding them is a result of cultural generalisation and anecdotes rather than evidence.’

The research, published in the journal Animal Cognition, used shiny metal screws, small foil rings and aluminium foil.

The researchers carried out a series of experiments with both a group of magpies which had come from a rescue centre, and wild magpies in the grounds of the university (pictured). Magpies only made contact with a shiny object twice in 64 tests. Both times a silver ring was picked up and immediately discarded

Half the screws and rings were painted matt blue while the rest retained their original silvery shine.

In the experiments, shiny and non-shiny objects were placed on the ground 11 inches (30cm) from a pile of food in the form of nuts.

Wild magpies only made contact with a shiny object twice in 64 tests, the researchers reported. On both occasions, a silver ring was picked up and immediately discarded.

Both the shiny and blue objects were either ignored or avoided. Often, the magpies exhibited wary behaviour by feeding less when the items were nearby.

During the study with captive birds, no contact was made with any of the objects.

Co-author Dr Natalie Hempel de Ibarra said: ‘Surprisingly little research has investigated the cognitive mechanisms of magpie behaviour.

‘Similarly to other large-brained members of the crow family with complex social systems, magpies are capable of sophisticated mental feats, such as mirror self-recognition, retrieval of hidden objects and remembering where and when they have hoarded what food item.

‘Instead of being compulsively drawn towards shiny objects, magpies decide to keep a safe distance when these objects are novel and unexpected.’
