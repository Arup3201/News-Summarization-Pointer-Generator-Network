Retired footballer Pat van den Hauwe has revealed how he once pointed a gun at a man's head and considered pulling the trigger - all because he owed him £100.

The former Everton, Tottenham and Birmingham defender, now 54, used to carry a '38 snub' gun after being given it for protection by a friend.

And, after being angered by the man in a chance meeting outside a pub, Van den Hauwe admits that he was tempted to use the weapon.

Honours: Division One title (Everton, 1985), Cup Winners' Cup (Everton, 1985), FA Cup (Tottenham, 1991) 

International Caps (Wales): 14

In an interview with the set pieces, the former Wales international said: 'I used to wear an ankle strap and at night if I went out, I carried it. There was just one incident, some guy who owed me money. 

'He kept ducking me and ducking me and after I'd had a few drinks and god knows what, I bumped into him outside a pub. I said "Where's me money?" and because he was a black belt in karate I thought "I'm not gonna f*** around with this". 

'He said to me "Well, what you gonna do about it?" and you know when I lose my temper, I lose my temper.

'So I just turned around, put me leg up on the wall, pulled me gun out and pointed it at his head. Then I looked up to him and said, "What are you gonna f****** do now then?'

Now 54, Van den Hauwe played for Spurs for four seasons before leaving to join Millwall in 1993

'I had a moment where it was touch and go, and, I really thought to myself "Before I do the ultimate wrong thing, it's time to give it back," you know? Because once it goes wrong there, you're banged up for life. I had to think seriously about it. I'm not a violent person anyway, you know what I mean?'

Van den Hauwe, who won the Division One title and European Cup Winners' Cup with Everton in 1985 and the FA Cup with Spurs in 1991, is now living in South Africa after suffering with depression.

And he insists that the gun incident, although potentially dangerous, altered his life for the better.

'I would say, that incident, carrying it, pulling it, p****** about with it, it was just a matter of time for me. I think it was a life changing thing. It calmed me down,' he added.
