She is always pushing the envelope when it comes to her fashion choices, and Emma Stone certainly cut a cool figure during Sunday's Screen Actors Guild Awards. 

The 26-year-old looked absolutely striking in a dramatic black gown that featured a long sheer black train that highlighted her lean legs.

The actress kept her neckline free from jewelry but did add some earrings in the shape of diamond florets.

So awards season rolls on with both the Producers' Guild and Screen Actors' Guild Awards this week end.

But of the two it's the SAG Awards that always pulls the big A-list crowd which means tonnes of glamour and red carpet gowns to obsess over. It was, as ever, a high octane affair with the great and the gorgeous pulling out all the stops.

Emma Stone was part  of the winning cast of Birdman and took her inspiration from a Gothic sensibility. And while she wore a completely sheer dress by Christian Dior, she kept it respectable with a long line tuxedo jacket on top.

Going see through has its risks but if worn like this with strategically placed opaque panels, it can be a sophisticated way to do 'sexy'. Emma's gown is couture so isn't available to buy online but we have found some fabulous dresses that will help you recreate the look in the real world.

Find some similar styles at Asos or grab a total bargain at Missguided, adding high heel sandals and a flash of red lipstick to complete the look.
