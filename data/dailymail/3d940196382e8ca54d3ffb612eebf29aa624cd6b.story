Britain's fish-eating habits will have to change due to warmer sea temperatures which is resulting in the disappearance of fish stocks from our coastal waters including cod. 

Experts have warned that people will have to start eating different fish like hake, red mullet and anchovies which are rising in numbers along Britain's coasts. 

According to scientists the seas around the UK have risen in temperature by about 1.6C since 1980.

Oceanographer Professor Callum Roberts from York University said that over the past 35 years, 15 of 36 species analysed have moved 300km north. 

Fish which live in colder waters have moved north towards Iceland while fish like the John Dory which used to be found near south-west England can now be found as north as Scotland.

Professor Stephen Simpson of Exeter University said the UK relies too heavily on the 'big five' - cod, haddock, tuna, prawns and salmon.

However, fishermen are catching fish like gurnard, sea bass, John Dory and hake but there is no market for them in the UK.

Professor Stephen Simpson of Exeter said: 'We have had a milder winter and warmer fish are moving north.

'Whatever the reason we have seen waters become warmer within the last 30 years.

'More exotic species are starting to show up in waters around the UK while the colder water fish are retreating further north. It is a bit like the changing of the guard. But we too have to adapt.

'Our grandparents enjoyed cod and haddock and it is a cultural thing that we like to eat those types of fish. But 70 per cent of our cod is now imported to the UK.

'We are buying fish like cod and haddock but then selling the fish we have around our shores to France, Spain and Portugal.

'It's time to be a bit more adventurous and adapt our diet because the fish is moving.'

Sustainable fishing aims to ensure there will be populations of ocean and freshwater wildlife for the future. 

Demand for seafood and advances in technology have led to fishing practices that are depleting fish and shellfish populations around the world.

Fishers remove more than 77 billion kilograms (170 billion pounds) of wildlife from the sea each year.

Scientists fear that continuing to fish at this rate may soon result in a collapse of the world’s fisheries. In order to continue relying on the ocean as an important food source, economists and conservationists say we will need to employ sustainable fishing practices.

The well-established Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certification is used for wild fish. Their blue tick label indicates that a fish comes from sustainable waters, is not over-exploited and is not endangered. 

A new report published this month by the Marine Conservation Society detailed how the ecosystem of the English Channel has been transformed by fishing and those at the top of the food chain are fairing badly. 

The report's authors say that this is evidence of 'fishing down the food chain'.

 'We really need governments to take on board the urgent need to better protect our seas'

Dr Jean-Luc Solandt

Since the 1940s, commonly-landed fish like spurdog, cod, and ling have come to be replaced in fishermens' nets by fish such as small spotted catsharks, and shellfish such as scallops, crabs and lobster.

The authors recommend a network of fisheries closures to help get the ecosystem back on the path to recovery.

Dr Jean-Luc Solandt, MCS senior biodiversity policy officer, said: 'This report adds evidence to what we have known for a number of years now - that the huge efforts of fishing boats from many nations are continuing to fish down the food chain in the English Channel - and elsewhere. 

'We really need governments to take on board the urgent need to better protect our seas.'

Dr Solandt added: 'There isn't one square kilometre of the English Channel that is protected from all forms of fishing. 

'Recently the government has applied pressure to stop destructive fishing in protected areas where reefs exist in the English Channel.

Royal Mail has also joined the campaign to highlight sustainable fishing by releasing these stamps

'This demonstrates that recovery is possible if areas are closed to damaging fishing gear.'

Royal Mail has also joined the campaign to highlight sustainable fishing.

In June the Royal Mail issued a set of UK stamps featuring five species threatened in UK waters and five that come from sustainable populations. 

A survey, commissioned by Royal Mail to coincide with the stamp launch, revealed 99 per cent of the people questioned had heard the term 'sustainable fishing' but more than half felt they knew little or nothing about it. 

Eighty-four per cent of people who took part in the survey said there wasn't enough information about sustainability when buying or ordering fish, whilst 66 per cent said they would buy or order more if they were assured of the sustainability of fishing methods or farming.  

Professor of Marine Conservation at York University, Callum Roberts, acted as a consultant for the stamp launch and said Marine Protected Areas that are off limits to fishing could recover endangered species like those on the stamps.

The fish that feature on the stamps which are threatened include the common skate, spiny dogfish, sturgeon and wolfish. 

Fish considered as sustainable include the dab, red gurnard, herring and pouting.
