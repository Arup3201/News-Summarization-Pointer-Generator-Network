'Extremely dangerous': Mark Lazarus has been jailed indefinitely

An 'extremely dangerous' cross-dressing sex attacker with an obsession for skirts tried to rape an elderly women while wearing one of the garments.

Mark Lazarus waited outside a public toilet in Teignmouth, south Devon, for more than hour until someone wearing a skirt went in.

He followed a 71-year-old into the toilets and went into a cubicle to change into skirt and tights himself, before pouncing on the woman as she washed her hands.

The terrified pensioner needed medical treatment for shock after heavily-built Lazarus dragged her into a cubicle where he tried to have sex with her.

She was only saved from the ordeal because she screamed for help and Lazarus fled - still wearing his skirt - and was seized by a brave passer-by who made a citizen’s arrest.

Lazarus, 39, was jailed indefinitely at Exeter Crown Court for the attack.

The court was obsessed with skirts and carried out two previous attacks while dressed as a woman, in one of which he walked behind a group of schoolgirls muttering ‘skirt, skirt’.

He was rated as extremely dangerous in risk assessments carried out by a psychiatrist and probation officer and highly likely to commit further attacks.

Lazarus, who is from Tiverton, but was living in a hostel in Howell Road, Exeter, admitted attempted rape and was jailed indefinitely.

Judge Phillip Wassall told him he could not apply for parole for at least four years.

The judge told him: 'If this lady of 71 had not resisted, you would have carried on and raped her. She received sever psychological trauma and now needs counselling.

'You have a predilection for dressing in skirts and that is exactly what you did when you went out looking for sexual stimulation and intending to commit a sexual offence.

'You saw this lady entering the toilet and you were attracted to her because she was wearing a skirt. You thought ‘skirt’ to yourself and that triggered this violent sexual attack.

'She was a vulnerable lady in a public situation and you attacked her for your sexual gratification. It was only because she fought you off and made so much noise and commotion that you stopped and fled.

'The public minded citizen who grabbed and tackled you and held on to you deserves commendation. This attack was cunning and conceived and but for her perseverance you would have completed the offence.

'There was an element of stealth and cunning. It was predatory behaviour with a chilling echo of your previous offending.

'The reports say that you acknowledge you are a high risk to women and you told the probation officer you don’t think you will ever change.

'You are in my view extremely dangerous. You are likely to re-offend with potentially incalculable consequences for the public.

'You victims are likely to be confronted by someone wearing a skirt and tights and that is likely to impact on them even more than a stranger rape in other circumstances.

'It was predatory behaviour with a chilling echo of your previous offending'

'Your risk of reoffending increases 
when you cross dress. This offence highlights your fascination with 
skirts. It seems that anyone of any age, from schoolgirls right up to 
ladies of this age, are at risk.'

Mr
 Sean Brunton, prosecuting, said the attack took place in February when 
Lazarus took a train to Teignmouth with a skirt and tights on under his 
clothing and waited outside the toilet block until a suitable victim 
entered.

He followed her in, stripped off to his skirt and tights, and attacked her as she washed her hands.

Mr Brunton said: 'He got her to the floor and she pulled back from him and screamed. He later told police that if it had not been for her screams he would have raped her.

'The victim said she was pushed to the ground and Lazarus lay on her and simulated sex. She was bruised and suffered psychological effects. She said she was devastated and was petrified by her ordeal.'

Lazarus was held by passer-by Sean Pope, who saw him fleeing the toilets in a skirt and tights and seized him, holding him until police arrived.

While being held on the ground Lazarus himself dialled 999 and made a full confession.

Mr Brunton said Lazarus is originally from Tiverton and his previous sexual offences took place on the banks of the River Exe in the town in July 1999.

On both occasions he dressed as a schoolgirl and followed young girls along the towpath, assaulting an 11-year-old and exposing himself to others.

Mr William Parkhill, defending, said Lazarus deserved credit for being totally candid to both the police and probation about the extent of his sexual obsessions.

He said that while reports currently rate him as extremely dangerous, it is possible he could benefit from many years of psychiatric treatment in prison.
