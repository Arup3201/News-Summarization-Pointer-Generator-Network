The LA Clippers have been sold to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer in a $2 billion deal after their previous owner Donald Sterling was given a NBA ban over racist remarks.

Ballmer, who retired from Microsoft in February, is said to have reached a binding agreement with Sterling's wife, Shelly, who had been handling the sale of the team.

The sale comes just days before a NBA panel was due to meet to discuss revoking Sterling's ownership over the team in light of the racism scandal last month.

On the day
 the deal was announced, Sterling was spotted looking relaxed as he had 
coffee with a mysterious woman in Los Angeles.

While the 80-year-old appeared at ease, his redheaded companion appeared embarrassed and tried to cover her face with a scarf.

Sterling had handed control of the sale negotiations to his wife afterthe NBA banned him for life in April over racist comments.

While the deal between Balmer and Shelly Sterling has been agreed, it still has to pass the approval of a NBA panel.

Although Sterling's lawyer had said he 
planned to fight his NBA ban and push to remove him as Clippers owner, 
it seemed that Sterling was not standing in the way of his wife's 
efforts to sell the team.

The likely
 new owner, Ballmer, retired from Microsoft in February after 14 years 
as CEO, and has an estimated fortune of $20.3 billion, KCTV5 reported.

The Clippers have not yet confirmed the sale to Ballmer. The team had been bought by Sterling for $12.5 million in 1981.

Before the deal can be sealed, it has to be approved by the NBA - and Sterling, who had dithered over whether he would allow his wife to sell the team he has owned for more than 30 years.

Sterling's attorney, Maxwell Blecher, told CNN: 'The league on Tuesday has a guillotine over his head.'

He
 added that Sterling planned to challenge their right to remove his team
 over an illegally recorded conversation in which he allegedly made 
racist remarks.

'He
 wants to be vindicated. He doesn't want his tombstone to say, "Here 
lies Donald Sterling, racist". And the NBA has the power to make that 
right,' Blecher said.

Ballmer, 
58, beat off a $1.6 billion bid from a group including David Geffen, 
Oprah Winfrey, Larry Ellison, and the Guggenheim Group, the LA Times reported.

The $2 billion price tag for the team is nearly the fourth highest price for a NBA team.

The highest price for a team was when the Dodgers were sold for $2.1 billion in 2012.

Ballmer,
 who stood down from his role at Microsoft earlier this year, has 
promised that if the deal is successful, the team will remain in LA and 
not be moved to his hometown of Seattle.

The sale came on the same day results from an E-Poll showed 92 per cent of Americans had named Sterling as the most hated man.

The
 poll of 1,100 Americans aged between 13 and 49 put Sterling at the top 
of the hate list, ahead of convicted fraudster Bernie Madoff, OJ Simpson
 and Justin Bieber.

He
 was even more unpopular that former Patriots football player Aaron 
Hernadez, who pleaded not guilty to two murder charges this week, but 
was placed just seventh on the list.

'Donald 
Sterling made these callous statements and then he has more than doubled
 down on them since then,' E-Poll president Gerry Philpott told ESPN.

The
 disgraced owner has said he will fight the NBA's attempt to ban him, 
and end his ownership of the team over racist comments, ESPN reported.

But despite the furor Sterling appeared unperturbed during a coffee stop on Thursday. After buying a large bar of Hershey's chocolate, he chatted on a cell phone outside a Starbucks.

His mysterious female companion however, tried to duck out of view from photographers and as the pair sat at an outside table, she draped a purple scarf over her head and face.
