A woman whose brother shot their mother dead and then killed himself four days later has accused mental health doctors of failing her family.

Mark Tyler, 37, killed Maureen Tyler, 79, with a single shot from a sawn-off shotgun as she sat on the sofa at home in Crays Hill near Basildon, Essex, last September.

Mr Tyler shot himself dead just four days later.

@Dangerous and psychotic': Mark Tyler, left, shot his mother Maureen, right, dead and then killed himself four days later an inquest has heard

An inquest in Chelmsford heard how Mr Tyler had a history of drug abuse and had been for a psychiatric consultation two months before the deaths.

His family say that doctors told him that he was 'dangerous and psychotic' yet still sent him back home to live with his mother and no formal diagnosis was made.

Coroner for Essex and Thurrock Caroline Beasley Murray said that the lack of a diagnosis left 'nothing that helps us explain why this event took place.'

She recorded a verdict of unlawful killing for Mrs Tyler and ruled that Mr Tyler took his own life.

After the inquest, Mr Tyler's sister Jessie Haggar said: 'He was told he was psychotic. He was told he was dangerous but allowed to stay with my mum.

'Mark's mental state was a lot more serious than depression.

'Mum thought she could cope. Mark has been painted as the devil, but he was not.'

A statement released by the Tyler family added that Mr Tyler was 'repeatedly ignored and let down by the system he consistently asked for help from.'

It added: 'This could have been avoided if certain agencies had heeded warnings and taken concerns about Mark's deteriorating mental health seriously.'

A spokesman for South Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust said the case was part of an 'ongoing independent investigation and an internal serious incident review' and declined to comment further.
