Television network NBC has turned to its viewers in a bid to discover the latest hit sitcom.

The initiative, dubbed 'NBC Comedy Playground', will give up to 10 finalists the chance to each create a pilot and a formal presentation to be judged by a panel of celebrities.

NBC said the two winners will then be chosen to create half-hour comedies to air on the network during the summer next year.

Comedy stars Jason Bateman (left) and Mindy Kaling (right) are among the panel of celebrities who will judge the NBC Comedy Playground finalists

Previous NBC successes include the television comedy series Frasier (from left to right Jane Leeves as Daphne Moon, David Hyde Pierce as Niles Crane, Kelsey Grammer as Frasier Crane, John Mahoney as Martin Crane, Peri Gilpin as Roz Doyle and Moose as Eddie the dog)

NBC Entertainment President Jennifer Salke told Entertainment Weekly: 'We are taking a bold, alternative approach in what we hope will uncover original comedy minds who are looking for a way to get into the television business.'

The top two ideas will be chosen by an advisory board including Eva Longoria, Sean Hayes, Mindy Kaling, Seth Meyers and Jason Bateman.

Another prize, the chance to create an online comedy, will be decided by a public vote.

The network has featured many of the most famous and best-loved American sitcoms ever, including Frasier, Seinfeld and Friends

More recent successes for the network have included The Office and 30 Rock.

The broadcaster's comedy output has not performed as well in recent years however.

Actress Eva Longoria, who starred in Desperate Housewives, will also be among the panel of celebrity judges

U.S. comedy hit Seinfeld (left) was also originally shown on NBC while Friends (right) was also a huge success for the broadcaster

More recently, sitcoms including The Office (starring from left to right Steve Carrell, John Krasinski and Rainn Wilson) have provided hits for NBC

Shows from this season, including Sean Saves The World, have also failed to live up to previous successes.

The move is the latest crowd-sourcing concept to have been used in the television development process - Amazon recently put all of their pilots online so viewers could choose their favourite.

Application videos for the NBC Comedy Playground can be submitted online at nbccomedyplayground.com from May 1.
