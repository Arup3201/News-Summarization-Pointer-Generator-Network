Ali vs Frazier, Coe vs Ovett, Borg vs McEnroe, Prost vs Senna... the rivalry between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo is football's response to these immortal sporting duels and the contest resumes on Tuesday night in Manchester.

These two giants of the international game find themselves on a collision course for the 27th time in their careers when Argentina play Portugal in a friendly at Old Trafford.

Their personal battle began in April 2008, when Ronaldo was still at Manchester United and they met Barcelona in the semi-finals of the Champions League.

It continued and intensified with a European final in 2009 and then grew more frequent when Ronaldo made his £80m switch to Real Madrid later that summer.

Since then, the bitter rivals have contested Clasicos in La Liga, the Copa del Rey, the Supercopa and the Champions League, with the balance of power swinging to and fro.

This match will be only their second meeting for their countries, the first being a friendly staged in Geneva back in February 2011.

Their rivalry splits fans right down the middle but admirers of Ronaldo might want to look away - in their 26 meetings so far, Messi has been on the winning side in 12 of them, Ronaldo in seven, with the other seven drawn.

The Argentinian wizard has scored 17 times when they've met compared with Ronaldo's 15. Messi has also provided 10 assists compared with just one for his Portuguese nemesis.

That first encounter back in 2008 - the semi-final, first leg of the Champions League at the Nou Camp - wasn't an occasion Ronaldo will remmember too fondly.

He skied a second-minute penalty but United hung on to claim a 0-0 draw, going on to win the second leg by virtue of a Paul Scholes screamer and then lift the trophy by beating Chelsea in Moscow.

Messi gained his revenge in Rome 12 months later, scoring Barcelona's second goal in a 2-0 win over United in the final as Ronaldo departed Old Trafford on a low note.

By the end of that year, the two players were beginning their still-rumbling rivalry in the Spanish game and the 2009-2010 campaign saw first blood to Messi as Barcelona won home and away against their rivals.

November 2010 saw perhaps the lowest point for Ronaldo in the head-to-head when Barcelona thrashed Real 5-0 - but Messi failed to find the net that night.

Both converted penalties as the return match at the Bernabeu finished 1-1 and, four days later, the Portuguese scored an extra-time winner as Real won a Clasico final of the Copa del Rey.

The two teams were then drawn against one another in the semi-finals of the Champions League and Messi again sparkled.

He scored twice in the Bernabeu during the first leg after Pepe was sent off and a 1-1 draw at the Nou Camp was enough to see Barcelona through to another final with United, which they won.

The following season saw six meetings across the various competitions, with Barcelona winning three of them. Ronaldo did, however, score the winner in Real's 2-1 success at the Nou Camp in the league late in the campaign, an important result as they broke Barcelona's strangehold on the title.

The magical hold these two players have on their teams was perhaps best illustrated in the thrilling 2-2 draw at the Nou Camp on October 7, 2012 as both players scored twice.

There were only the two Clasicos last season but March's epic 4-3 win for Barcelona in the Bernabeu saw Messi score a superb hat-trick, including two pressurised penalties.

The latest meeting came late last month when a Ronaldo penalty set Real on their way to a 3-1 league win, ending Barcelona's unbeaten start.

Who knows what these two marvels of modern football will conjure up at Old Trafford in the latest instalment of football's most gripping personal rivalry.
