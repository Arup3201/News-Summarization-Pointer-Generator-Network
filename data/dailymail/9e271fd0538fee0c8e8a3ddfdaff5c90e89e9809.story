Isabella Janew, 16 months, died at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children after suffering two cardiac arrests following heart surgery

A toddler died after a blood pressure monitor was turned away by a nurse who told her mother that looking at it would 'drive her mad', an inquest heard today.

Isabella Janew, 16 months, had been admitted to the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children for surgery to widen her aortic valve after she was born with a soft heart murmur and later diagnosed with aortic stenosis.

She had been diagnosed in May 2013, when she was a year old, and had been put on a waiting list for surgery. 

But Isabella, from Gloucester, suffered a cardiac arrest and a pulmonary haemorrhage during the operation in September 2013.

Doctors battled to save Isabella's life and after some time were finally able to bring her round abandoning the half-finished procedure and returning her to intensive care.

However, her parents, Daniel and Debbie Janew, claim nurses in charge of her care ignored warnings to keep her blood pressure high and ignored their pleas for help when it dropped low. 

Mr and Mrs Janew said they had raised concerns about their daughter's blood pressure, only for the machine to be turned away from them by a nurse so they could not see it.  

The parents said their daughter had responded well when her neurological function was checked, but doctors quickly placed her back into an induced state.

Within hours Isabella suffered another cardiac arrest, and despite 40 minutes of CPR, doctors were unable to bring her round, and she died.

Reading her husband's statement at the inquest at Flax Burton Coroner's Court, Mrs Janew said: 'I held Isabella's hand and told her to squeeze mine.

Isabella Janew, 16 months, had been admitted to the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children for surgery to widen her aortic valve after she was born with a soft heart murmur and later diagnosed with aortic stenosis 

'She gently squeezed my hand and opened her eyes and looked at me. Then she turned and looked at her mum.

'She became frustrated with the instruments and the machinery attached to her.

'She was lively and we were told at that point a doctor hit the muscle relaxant drug button again as he thought her to be too lively.'

Mr Janew added: 'We were told by doctors her blood pressure couldn't be allowed to drop below 50, and should preferably be kept above it. 

'Her blood pressure often dropped below that but when we told nurses they said ‘don’t worry, it’s fine’. 

'Her blood pressure often dropped below that but when we told nurses they said 'don't worry, it's fine'.

'At this point her blood pressure was around 40, Debbie saw it drop to 38 on a number of occasions.

'When Debbie voiced concerns again the machine was turned away from her by the nurse who said it would drive her mad.'

The inquest heard that Isabella's illness had been detected by doctors in Gloucester when she was just over a year old, in May 2013.

The toddler was referred to Dr Robin Martin at the hospital, who added her to his list to perform surgery, and she was given a date of September 9 for the operation.

The night before the operation, the inquest heard, Isabella, despite suffering from sweating and panting was her usual talkative self.

'The evening she was extremely playful, wanting to play with her toys and talk and walk everywhere,' said Mrs Janew.

'Although Isabella was initially placed in a room with three beds she was moved to a room on her own as she was talking, singing and wanting to play, keeping the other children awake," Daniel added.

'During this time she never had her blood pressure read, or re-taken.

'On the day of the surgery Isabella was sat on my knee singing to me, then we watched a children's TV programme.' 

Earlier this month an inquest into the death of four-month-old Lacey-Marie Poton (pictured with her mother Emma Norley), who died at the hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest at her home in 2013, was told that paramedics had not treated her condition as an emergency

Isabella was taken into theatre at around 9am, but despite showing good vital signs, crashed within minutes of surgeons adding a dye into her heart to assess its output.

Dr Martin told the inquest: 'As I was looking at the screen there was a very abrupt change in her ECG.

'This usually indicates there is not enough blood getting into her coronary arteries.

'Almost simultaneously upon seeing that I noticed the pressure in her left ventricle dropped to a very low level. It was clearly not a very good situation.'

He added that he had never seen so much blood appear during any similar case.

It later emerged Isabella had been given an overdose of two drugs designed to constrict the blood vessels, adrenaline and vasopressin, during her fight on the operating table.

But, the inquest heard, it was unlikely this caused her second cardiac arrest.

The inquest was also told that doctors are still unsure as to what caused Isabella’s catastrophic arrest.

'To be frank we were never able to assert the reason she went into cardiac arrest,' Dr Martin said.

The Janews are among up to ten families who have called for a public inquiry into care at Bristol Children's Hospital, with the independent review headed by lawyer and healthcare specialist Sir Ian Kennedy set to be completed this year.

Isabella's is the eighth inquest into the death of a child following cardiac surgery at the hospital.

Earlier this month an inquest into the death of four-month-old Lacey-Marie Poton, who died at the hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest at her home in 2013, was told that paramedics had not treated her condition as an emergency.

The inquest continues.
