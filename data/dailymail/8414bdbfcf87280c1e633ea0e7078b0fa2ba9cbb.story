Premier League matches will be played on Friday nights from summer 2016 under the next TV deal but the Mail on Sunday can reveal that another more radical proposal — league games played overseas — will not happen for the foreseeable future. Fan power has seen the idea shelved, perhaps for good.

The Premier League’s chief executive Richard Scudamore wants overseas games to happen, following the lead of the most lucrative sports league in the world, the NFL.

Most of the Premier League’s clubs, led by the major foreign-owned sides, want them to happen. Meaningful games in foreign host cities could earn tens of millions per match. But home-based supporters’ opposition seems to have kiboshed the notion.

‘The clubs are keen for us to keep developing the concept but we’re no nearer,’ said Scudamore, who first proposed in 2008 that a ‘39th game’ be played abroad each year, in an exclusive interview.

‘The idea of an extra game is gone. Whether you play a regular season game (overseas), that has challenges, not least among the fans, which we take into consideration.

‘I’ve never shied away from the fact that personally I think it’s a good idea. I bear the scars from thinking it’s a good idea. A lot of the clubs think it’s a good idea... but there is absolutely no time line and no idea when it might happen.’

Asked to confirm that an overseas game will not happen foreseeably, in the next TV round and before 2020 at the earliest, Scudamore said: ‘You can make that assumption.’

Sky Sports have the rights to 116 games this season, and that number could go up with the new deal

The Premier League tender document for UK live TV rights for 2016-19 is just dropping on the desks of senior executives at major broadcasters. The Premier League will sell 168 live games per season to UK television from 2016-17 to 2018-2019, up from 154 games now.

Those games will be sold in seven packages, five of 28 games and two of 14 per year, and about 10 games per season will be on Friday nights. No buyer will be allowed more than 126 games per season.

The Premier League currently make £3.018billion from Sky and BT for domestic live rights for 2013-16 and about £2.9bn more combined from foreign live rights (£2.2bn), highlights, near-live rights and mobile clip rights.

These massive sums flow to the clubs, who in turn spend it buying and paying big-name players, most of them foreign, and therefore attractive to global audiences. So a ‘virtuous circle’ of growth continues.

BT Sport caused a shock with the previous deal when they paid almost £6.5m per game in 2013

The Premier League will soon boast the second biggest annual income from broadcast rights in the world, according to a report from industry specialists TV Sports Markets.

The English top flight currently sits in third place, behind the figures for American football and baseball in the US. But the next TV deal could soar to £7.5bn between 2016-19, an annual income of £2.5bn, which would take the Premier League second. And 38 per cent of the League’s broadcast income is from overseas, already the highest ratio by far in the world.

1 NFL £4.14billion

(American football income from broadcast rights in 2014)

2 MLB £1.94billion

(American baseball)

3 Premier League £1.91billion

(Domestic and overseas income)

4 NBA £1.21billion

(American basketball)

5 Champions League

6 Serie A 

7 Olympics

8 NHL 

9 Ligue 1 (France) 

10 La Liga (Spain)

Analysts and insiders have contrasting views of how much these deals could grow but everyone agrees they will grow.

It would be no surprise to see the total three-year pot soar from £5.9bn to £7.5bn, and if major new players such as Qatar-owned beIN SPORTS come to the table for the UK rights, as long suggested, it could yet be more.

The Premier League’s global appeal is being highlighted this weekend at ‘BPL Live’, a huge public event in Mumbai, India, where 20,000 fans from the sub-continent are gathering in a public park, essentially to watch Premier League matches on a big screen.

Yesterday they watched Chelsea play Hull on one screen and Leicester host Manchester City on another. Today they will be treated to Manchester United against Liverpool.

There is also a tented village where fans can be photographed with the Premier League trophy, visit exhibitions by the League’s clubs and meet a range of ‘legends’ including former United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel and former Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler.

Vijay Kuppili, a 30-year-old manager with an online company, has made a two-hour flight from his home town in south-east India specifically to attend BPL Live this weekend.

‘I’ve been following the Premier League for 10 years, since Arsenal’s Invincibles,’ he said, although he is a Manchester United fan, through admiration of Sir Alex Ferguson’s management and teams.

He and college mates, variously fans of United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea, watched whatever games they could as students in their communal digs, and remain hard-core fans today.

Interest has also soared again in the past year, he says, because the coverage within India has improved, with more games and higher broadcasting standards.

The NFL has made lucrative sums of money by staging a host of games at Wembley Stadium

That can be explained by STAR TV’s investment. The rights holders on the sub-continent paid £93m for their current three-year rights, up from £29m previously.

They have also invested in new commentators, some of them trained in England by veterans including Sky’s Martin Tyler, and now offer games in multiple languages.

‘Football is an aspirational sport and India has a committed fan following for the Barclays Premier League,’ said STAR’s chief operating officer, Sanjay Gupta. ‘BPL Live is a great initiative to take fans closer to the game, its iconic clubs and legendary heroes.’

Schmeichel, in Mumbai to help promote the event, said interest in the Premier League in India is ‘massive’. He has also travelled extensively as a United ambassador and adds: ‘Every time I go somewhere I’m still genuinely taken aback at how big United are.’

Yesterday he went to the Leicester City tent at BPL Live to have a FaceTime chat with his son Kasper, Leicester’s goalkeeper, back home. ‘I was surprised to see how many people were in there, the interest here is in the League as a whole, not just one club,’ Schmeichel Snr said.

‘There are people in Chelsea shirts, and United, Liverpool, but also Leicester and other clubs.’

Scudamore sees India as one of eight key ‘strategic’ international markets where the rights values can soar in the 2016-19 sales round. The USA and China are also in that bracket.

‘The size of the market, the potential growth in the market and also the appetite of local partners to develop that market — when you get those three things coming together, that’s what determines it,’ he explained.

He knows that the League is most likely to see a surge in TV income in any market, domestic or foreign, where two or more rival broadcasters both desperately want the rights.

‘Growth tends to be driven, historically, by competitive tension,’ he said. ‘Where there is competitive tension our rights grow and where there isn’t any they tend not to grow. Therefore it’s difficult to forecast. But do I see headroom? Yes. Do I see growth? Yes.’

Independent analysts agree. Kevin McCullagh of industry specialists TV Sports Markets, said: ‘The Premier League’s international rights value is the envy of sports properties around the world, including the biggest US leagues such as the NFL, MLB, and NBA.

‘There is still room for growth in Premier League international rights values. Crucially, it is popular in many regions with growing pay-television industries, such as in Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Latin America. Pay-television has been the big driver of sports rights values around the world. It is also benefiting from the rise of football in the US — football rights fees have been growing strongly there in recent years.’
