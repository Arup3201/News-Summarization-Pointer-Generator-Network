David Miliband earned a staggering £20,000 a day as an adviser for a company investing in green technology, it has been revealed.

The former Foreign Secretary was paid £70,000 for just three-and-a-half days spent working for VantagePoint CleanTech in California.

The post with the American venture capitalists is the latest in a series of lucrative part-time positions Mr Miliband has taken up since being beaten by his brother in the Labour leadership contest.

On top of that he also pocketed £125,000 for delivering eight speeches around the world in the last year, according to the House of Commons register of financial interests.

News of Mr Miliband’s staggering earnings comes after his brother has led a populist attack on 'fat cat' executives in a bid to turn round his flagging political fortunes.

How David Miliband has built up his fortune since losing the Labour leadership election in September 2010. His pay includes:

In total, David Miliband earned in excess of £380,000 in the last 12 months - on top of his annual MP's salary of £65,000.

Since losing the leadership poll 18 months ago he has earned more than £500,000.

There is no suggestion that he has broken any rules by taking up the highly-paid positions.

VantagePoint paid him to travel over to the U.S. to carry out his three days work in August and September last year.

He was recruited to advise the company's investment team on international opportunities and policy innovations.

Alan Salzman, VantagePoint chief-executive, said as he was appointed last year: 'David brings a truly unique perspective and world-class experience that will help us navigate complex energy markets.'

Mr Miliband said: 'In a world shifting from resource plenty to resource scarcity I am looking forward to working with VantagePoint towards real solutions to global energy needs.'

The company have invested £2.5billion in IT, digital media, energy efficiency and green industries.

Last month David Miliband took another lucrative job with Pakistan-based City firm Indus Basin Holdings.

The firm, set up to funnel investment into Pakistani agriculture, boasts a number of colourful backers, including a Swiss aristocrat playboy called Baron Lorne Thyssen-Bornemisza.

Mr Miliband, who will earn about £50,000 a year from the part-time position – which is not expected to occupy him for more than a few days a month.

He also earns £75,000 a year as a non-executive director at Sunderland Football Club for just 12 to 15 days work a year.

The politician has constructed his business affairs in a way that appears to limit tax liability.

Mr Miliband would pay income tax at the normal rate on his £65,000 salary for being an MP.

But his non-parliamentary earnings, however, are paid into a company called The Office Of David Miliband Limited, which is subject to corporation tax of between 20 per cent and 27.5 per cent – substantially less than the 50 per cent rate of income tax for those earning more than £150,000.
