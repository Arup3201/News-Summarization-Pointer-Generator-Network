The use of colour in photography was a readily available - albeit expensive - practice in Europe and the U.S. by the 1890s, but it wasn't until 30 years later that the method really caught on in Russia.

Now a new exhibition at the Photographers' Gallery in London explores the emergence and development of colour photography in the country in the years before and after the 1917 Russian Revolution.

The Primrose exhibition - which takes its name for the Russian word for 'first colour' - shows how the earliest efforts to move away from black and white images came in the form of 'hand colouring' techniques, which saw water-colours, paints or dyes manually added to the monochrome images.

The next development was invented by photographer Sergei Produkin-Gorsky, who exposed black and white printing plates through red, green and blue filters three times in quick succession. This technique produced misty but atmospheric images that looked almost as if they were paintings.

The method caught on and was widely used until the mid-1960s, when a cheap colour film was finally made available to the public - 10 years after the government created a version that was restricted for state use only.

Even this film sparked photographs seemingly unique to Russia, as it was mass produced in the form of reversal film designed to be used in projectors, rather than creating negatives or prints.

Incredible: This 1953 photograph of Stalin's funeral was taken by Dmitri Baltermants in Moscow. Surrounded by a sea of brightly-coloured flowers and a near-forest of palms, Baltermants' clever use of colour and light gives the brutal dictator's final public appearance a suitably atmospheric feel

Impression: This image - another by the photojournalist Dmitri Baltermants - is titled 'Rain' and shows Moscow commuters waiting at a bus stop during a heavy downpour in the mid-1960s. The image - with open umbrellas taking on the appearance of lilies, the shimmering street looking like water and the overall soft pastel colouring - looks almost like a painting by Claude Monet

Human spirit: Although these photographs were taken more than 50 years apart, the vivid use of colour makes them appear contemporaneous. In Yelena Mrozovskaya's 'Portrait of girl in Little Russia costume' (left) - which was taken in Saint Petersburg in the 1900s - colour is introduced manually by applying paint or dye to a monochrome image. Meanwhile in Ivan Shagin's 'Student' (right) colour reversal film of the sort normally meant for a projector is used

Technique: Yakov Khalip's photograph of young sea cadets at the end of the 1940s is a colour image made using Sergei Produkin-Gorsky's innovative method of exposing black and white printing plates through red, green and blue filters three times in quick succession

Design: Both P.T. Ivanovs' 1911 image 'First year of the military service' (left) and Varvara Stepanova's 1932 photomontage 'Beready!'Â  appear in the Primrose exhibition, which takes its name for the Russian word for 'first colour'. The project explores the emergence and development of colour photography since the late 19th Century

Red is the colour: Work by the photojournalist Dmitri Baltermants - such as this atmospheric untitled image of a Soviet flag in the 1960s - makes up a large part of the Photographers' Gallery exhibition. Warsaw-born Baltermants graduated from Moscow State University to become a maths teacher in a Military Academy, but fell in love with photography and began a career in photojournalism in 1939
