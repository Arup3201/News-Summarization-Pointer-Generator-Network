He was left paraplegic and told he would never walk again following a motocross crash in 2009.

But now, Kent Stephenson is able to move his legs once more - and can even stand up briefly.

This is thanks to an electrical implant that has given him and three other men a new lease of life.

The spinal implant, which is part of a 'groundbreaking' experimental study funded by the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation, is electrically stimulated by a remote that Mr Stephenson carries.

Moving again: Kent Stephenson, 27, was left paraplegic following a horrific motocross crash in 2009. But now, he is able to move his legs once more - and can even stand up briefly - thanks to a new electrical implant

Overjoyed: Speaking of the moment he was able to move his lower limbs for the first time in six years, Mr Stephenson (pictured, left, and right, with his fiancee, Misti Richeson)  described it as 'really overwhelming'

Speaking of the moment he was able to move his lower limbs for the first time in six years, the 27-year-old, from Mount Pleasant, Texas, said: 'It's really overwhelming with the results I've gotten.

'I felt the charge come from my back down to my leg and it contracted and [my leg] was pulled back and I was blown away, I was like "woah". We found out later on that I could stand.

'I could not only pull my my left leg back, I could also move my toes, I could move my ankles, I could do the same thing on the right side as I could on the left side, I could extend my legs.'

He added: 'I feel extremely blessed to be able to be a part of this program. It's hard to really find a word that describes how great - I mean, it's really unbelievable. I can actually do it.'

Although experts have said Mr Stephenson's movement is promising, they have warned that the treatment isn't a cure. The patient still cannot walk and has to use a wheelchair to get around.

Mr Stephenson, a former ProAm motocross racer, was attempting an 80-foot jump in Kaufman County when his bike locked up and he crashed to the ground on June 9, 2009, according to KLTV.

Tragedy: Mr Stephenson, an ex-ProAm motocross racer (pictured: Mr Stephenson in action), was attempting an 80-foot jump in Kaufman County when his bike locked up and he crashed to the ground on June 9, 2009

'I was trying to catch fifth gear on a certain section of the track and I finally did it. Then I started going off the face of the jump and the bike locked up,' said Mr Stephenson.

'I was just kind of going through the air and it was just nose down. I tried to jump away from it … Then we landed on the front and did lots of cartwheels and somersaults.'

Speaking to the Reeve Foundation, he added: 'I knew instantly that I couldn't feel my legs. The doctors explained that... there was basically no hope for me to regain any mobility or movement.'

Mr Stephenson, who had cracked one of his vertebrae and practically exploded another one in the crash, underwent surgery at Parkland Hospital in Dallas to fuse part of his spine together.

Hoping to walk again one day: But although the procedure went well, medics later informed him he would never be able to feel or move his lower limbs ever again. Mr Stephenson, however, refused to accept their words

Out on a shoot: 'I just felt like there was more out there,' said Mr Stephenson, who had always dreamed of becoming a professional motocross racer. Above, the patient is pictured (center) in a Facebook photo

But although the procedure went well, medics later told him he would never be able to feel or move his body beneath his waist ever again. Mr Stephenson, however, refused to accept their words.

'I just felt like there was more out there,' said Mr Stephenson, who had always dreamed of becoming a professional motocross racer and became engaged to his girlfriend, Misti Richeson, on Saturday.  

When Mr Stephenson heard of the experimental study - which followed  a paraplegic man having his spinal cord successfully zapped with electricity three years ago - he immediately agreed to take part.

But neither he nor the researchers, based at the Human Locomotion Research Center laboratory, Frazier Rehab Institute, in Louisville, Kentucky, realized the incredible progress he would make.

The patient and three other paralyzed men - Andrew Meas, Dustin Shillcox and Rob Summers - saw a 16-electrode array implanted onto each other their spinal cords. It was then stimulated with electricity during regular sessions.

After two years and three months of tests and therapy sessions on his legs, Mr Stephenson was eventually able to move them in what he and his family deemed a 'miraculous' development.

The first time he did so, his lifted his left leg up to a '90 degree angle', his proud mother, Kim, said.

Building up strength: Mr Stephenson was the second person in the country to be implanted with the epidural stimulation device. Now, he is able to ride on an off-road utility vehicle for entire days at a time with his friends

Mr Stephenson was the second person in the country to be implanted with the epidural stimulation device. Now, he is able to ride on an off-road utility vehicle for entire days at a time with his friends. 

'I'm able to (make) these voluntary movements and it really changed my life,' said Mr Stephenson, who can have the implant turned 'on' for three hours a day. 

'I've seen some benefits of (the device) training even when it's turned off. There have been huge improvements in bowel, bladder and sexual function.' 

Meas, Shillcox and Summers - all of whom have different spinal  injuries - have also seen positive results from the experimental treatment. The four men all dream of walking again one day.

Speaking to CNN, Peter Wilderotter, CEO of the foundation, said of the research: 'We can improve lives in the here and now and that's an extraordinary change in the way we think about this.' 

However, Peter Ellaway, an emeritus professor of physiology at Imperial College London, who had no role in the study at the University of Louisville, said: 'There is no miracle cure on the way.' 

But he admitted that the treatment could prove 'life-changing', saying: 'But this could certainly give paralyzed people more independence and it could still be a life-changer for them.'
