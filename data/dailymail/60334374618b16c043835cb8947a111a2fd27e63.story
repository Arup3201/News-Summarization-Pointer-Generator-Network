Another day, another pop-up restaurant in London. But the people behind Deluxe, which opens on Friday 14 November for one month only, promise a 'surprise twist' which will only be revealed at the end of the meal.

As well as dishing up Santa's red-nosed pal. the pop up will serve tagliatelle with lobster and truffle oil, pears in spiced red wine with dark chocolate orange mousse and Belgian chocolate cheesecake with salted caramel.

'Deluxe is being advised by a Michelin star Chef, and there is a surprise twist at the end of the meal which will reveal all, and proving that you don't need to be a Michelin star chef to cook quality food,' a restaurant spokesperson said to MailOnline Food.

Dessert choices include pears in spiced red wine with dark chocolate orange mousse and Belgian chocolate cheesecake with salted caramel (pictured) 

The 'non-restaurant' restaurant  will offer diners a menu which they can easily create in their own homes when Deluxe closes its doors on 14 December.
