Dakota Johnson is about to become a household name thanks to her steamy first role in Fifty Shades Of Grey. 

But this member of Hollywood royalty still isn't sure if playing virgin-turned-sexpot Anastasia Steele was the right thing to do.

In fact, when asked if she had any doubts about agreeing to the part, Dakota, 25, told The Telegraph: 'Absolutely. The whole time. Even now there are moments when I think, 'What the f*** have I done?’

Dakota Johnson says she felt 'detached' watching herself play Anastasia Steele in Fifty Shades Of Grey

She plays Anastasia, the innocent student journalist who falls in love with a rich, controlling billionaire with a kinky side, in the film adaptation of EL James' smash hit novel.

Various sex scenes involving implements, blindfolds and a red leather-lined 'room of pain' follow.

Dakota - the daughter of Melanie Griffiths and Don Johnson, granddaughter of The Birds star Tippi Hedren and former step-daughter of Antonio Banderas - said she's comfortable appearing nude on screen, but that doesn't mean she wants her family to see it.

'It’s true that I’m not ashamed of my body. I’m comfortable and I think more women should be more confident. I think nudity and sexual scenes in movies are beautiful when they’re tastefully done.'

The sex scenes were filmed on a closed set with Sam Taylor-Johnson creating a 'safe, protected environment', she said.

Her family however have been 'banned' from watching the film. 'I don’t want them to see it. I wouldn’t want to see them doing it.' 

The actress, 25, admitted to still wondering if taking the role of Anastasia was the right thing to do

Shimmer in Chanel Couture

Dakota Johnson, the star of the highly anticipated movie, Fifty Shades of Grey, arrived at the Golden Globe Awards in this silver Chanel couture creation, showing off exactly why she has become such a hot commodity in Hollywood.

The sequined gown features a thigh-skimming slit and intricate embellishments along the bodice, both of which creative director Karl Lagerfeld does so well.

Metallics were in high demand on the red carpet this award season. Julianne Moore wore sparkly Givenchy Couture and Reese Witherspoon shined in Calvin Klein, with several of their peers following suit.

For your next event, instead of basic black, why not throw on some shine like Dakota? Start with one of the sequined looks we've pulled together below.

The Adrianna Papell stunner is incredibly elegant and at $222.40, it won't put too much of a dent in your pocketbook either. Or have a splurge in this Badgley Mischka Collection sequin cowl back gown. It's so gorgeous that at $615.00, we're not exactly complaining.

Jamie Dornan did extensive research into the BDSM world before playing billionaire Christian Grey

While Sam Taylor-Johnson and Jamie Dornan heavily researched the world of BDSM, which stands for bondage/discipline, domination, submission, sadism/masochism, but Dakota said she only took advice from a consulting dominant who was on the film set.

Jamie, 32, put a lot of time into preparing to embody Christian Grey. He toldGQ magazine: 'In the course of researching this character, I have seen the reality very closely.

'I can tell you from an alarmingly first-hand perspective it's not altogether sexy. But I've been in a dungeon with a lukewarm beer while a dominant has had some fun with his submissive and it was very playful and jovial and not at all dark and serious. There was a lot of laughter.

EL James turned her fan fiction fantasies into millions of pounds with her steamy Fifty Shades trilogy

About the mechanics of filming the infamous sex scenes, he added: 'Your dignity is intact in as much as it's all tucked away in a little flesh-coloured bag.

'As a guy, you put all the essentials in a little bag and you tie it up, like a little bag of grapes and it's tucked away. It's quite a peculiar thing to do every day.'

Meanwhile, Dakota has braced herself in case the film bombs: 'A lot of really amazing actors do really s*** movies. It happens. Sometimes all the ingredients don’t work.' 

Maria Schneider in Last Tango In Paris, never stepped out of the shadow of the infamous butter scene.

Jane March - the north London teenager dubbed 'the sinner from Pinner' for starring in The Lover - failed to deliver on her early promise.

Margo Stilley, who appeared in Michael Winterbottom's experimental film 9 Songs, in 2004, which ignited debate over its X-rated scenes, has acted in a few indie films but never became a big name at the box office. 

Elizabeth Berkley was a teen star of Saved By The Bell before making her film debut as Nomi Malone in the much-derided, explicit Showgirls.
