The French prefect responsible for Calais today threatened more forced expulsions of hundreds of asylum seekers trying to get to Britain.

It follows last month’s bulldozing of three camps which they were using in between trying to get on board ferries to the UK.

Denis Robin, the prefect for the Pas-de-Calais, admitted that the tough measures had not solved the problem, and that more might be necessary.

Gendarmes search the shelters of illegal immigrants in their camp at Calais last month. French police expelled around 650 migrants from camps around port, but the region's prefect now says more action may be needed

Speaking at a press conference in 
Arras, he said: ‘If this new initiative by the State does not have the 
right effect, I will have to proceed with another evacuation.’

Despite riot police doing everything possible to disperse the migrants, Mr Robin said around 900 were still hanging around his region, including many in Calais itself.

‘The Calais migrants are today in a geographic and judicial impasse,’ said Mr Robin.

‘The British government will not let them break the law and circumvent our security measures, and the migrants are not accepting the measures we offer them.’

Despite action which has been attacked by human rights groups, Mr Denis insisted that the ‘French government is ready to hold out a hand, to make a national effort’ to help the migrants.

He said any asylum demands would be ‘dealt with urgently’ and that ‘shelters would be offered’, although far away from Channel ports like Calais.

Mr Robin insisted there would be no repeat of the Sangatte Red Cross refugee centre which acted as magnet for thousands of asylum seekers before being shut down in 2002.

He also pointed to the dangers migrants in Calais were facing after a security guard was arrested on Friday for opening fire on two of them.

The victims were hit in the back and arms by a high powered air rifle as they hung around the town’s ferry port along with around 300 other men.

Philippe Wannesson, a local volunteer who works with migrants, said the attacks happened ‘not far’ from a food distribution centre set up by charities, but which may now be forced to close.

It is currently ‘occupied’ by around 300 migrants, some of whom are on hunger strike to protest at the way they are being treated.

Migrants try to resist the forced evictions from their camp. The official reason for the clearance was to prevent an outbreak of the contagious skin disease Scabies from spreading.

Squads of riot police smashed up and then bulldozed three illegal camps full of Britain-bound migrants in Calais at the end of May.

The official reason for the clearance was to prevent an outbreak of the contagious skin disease Scabies from spreading.

But Mr Robin said he also wanted to prevent the creation of another ‘Jungle’ – the name of a similar illegal camp bulldozed in 2009.

Critics said the migrants would simply be left on the street, without even a roof over their heads.

Border guards meanwhile reported dozens of people hiding in shrubs along roads leading into the port, with many attempting to jump on lorries as they slowed down.

A Sudanese asylum seeker was killed around the same time after trying to conceal himself under the axle of a British coach in a supermarket car park.

Charity workers helping refugees from wars in Syria and Afghanistan reacted with outrage to the clear-out, blaming it on a shift to the far-right in French politics.

Most of the migrants play a nightly game of cat and mouse with the police and border officials as they try to reach Britain in the back of lorries.

Once in the UK they will claim asylum, which entitles them to state support while their application is being processed, or disappear into the black economy.

Four migrants died in one week alone in March this year. On March 9 an Albanian man was killed on a motorway outside the town. Three days later, Ethiopian Mesfin Germa was hit by a lorry as he walked to the port.

The body of a 25-year-old Ethiopian man, Senay Berthay, was found in Calais’s  Batellerie dock on March 14 and the next day a fellow Ethiopian in his 20s was crushed to death by a car while hiding on a vehicle transporter.

It is thought he had been among a group of three men who got on the truck and then realised it was going in the wrong direction.

Calais Mayor Natacha Bouchart has long argued that Britain’s ‘generous welfare system’ is the real cause of the migrant crisis in her town.
