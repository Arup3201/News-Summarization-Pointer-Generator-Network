A green-fingered pensioner's attempt to grow shrubs and flowers in his front garden has spectacularly back-fired - after the foliage grew so fast it engulfed his entire house.

Colin Melbourne's £240,000 semi-detached property in posh Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, has become consumed by rampant ivy and conifers, leaving it invisible to passers-by.

His front garden is so overrun with plants the windows, front door and even the garage are hidden beneath the sprawling greenery.

The £240,000 home in posh Leamington Spa has become almost invisible to passers-by due to sprawling ivy

Neighbours would help pensioner tame his unruly garden if asked but think owner is 'probably too proud to ask'

Residents who live near Mr Melbourne, 78, are now urging the council to help him bring his wayward garden back under control.

One resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'Mr Melbourne lives in the house and has done for many years.

'He is often seen planting flowers and shrubs but the weather this year has sent them skyward.

'He is a character and usually puts his plants in bags before transferring them into his garden.

One resident said that the good weather this year has sent the green-fingered pensioner's foliage up to the sky

'The front garden has also been a bit unruly but this summer the good weather has sent the ivy and conifers shooting up.

'The house is so hidden you can't even see the front door.

'I feel sorry for the people living directly next door because their home is very nicely kept and has recently been repainted.

Another local said it was unfair for neighours who take care of their home but live next to the unsightly foliage

'I hate to say it but the house has become a bit of an eyesore and the council really should take some action if for no other reason than to help Mr Melbourne control his plants.

'It must be really depressing living like that, it must be very gloomy inside.'

Another neighbour added: 'Mr Melbourne is no trouble to us or anyone on the street.

'His efforts to improve his garden have clearly got away from him and we'd all happily help him if he wanted us to but I daresay he's too proud to ask.'

Mr Melbourne took up gardening after retiring from his job as a market trader.

Neighbour and friend Trudy Dickson, 50, who has known him for 20 years, said: 'Colin is a lovely man and a real character.

'He used to run a market stall in Coventry selling women's handbags. His front room was always full of stock and he used to put flowers in the bags which he couldn't sell.

'No one minds that his garden is overgrown, it is a bit of a local landmark and probably wouldn't be the same if he cut it all down.

'He is a character but very generous. When we held a street party for the Queen's Jubilee he gave a very generous donation and came out and chatted to everybody. He was charming.

'He has always shown an enthusiasm for gardening but it does look like his plants have got away from him a bit.' 

Mr Melbourne yesterday refused to comment.

In February last year homeowner Kenneth Mould, 50, was fined £1,000 after he failed to tidy up the front of his home in Rugeley, Staffordshire, which was completely obscured by ivy.
