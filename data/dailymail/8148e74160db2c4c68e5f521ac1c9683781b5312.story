Arguably some of the most risqué moments in fashion have been voted the most famous.

Kylie Minogue wearing tiny gold hot pants in her 2000 hit video Spinning Around comes in at first place, while a close second is Liz Hurley in a revealing Versace safety pin dress while accompanying Hugh Grant to the 1994 Four Weddings and a Funeral premiere.

Coming in third place is Sarah Jessica Parker's flamboyant style in Sex And The City, which made tutus and stilettos acceptable daytime attire, and brought back the name plate necklace.

Champions of girl power, the Spice Girls, and their love for platform trainers, glitz and garishness also make an appearance on the iconic list at number four. 

The top ten charts a stylish and humorous look at a generation of fashion followers over two decades that have shaped what women wear today.

Prior to 2005 Wellington boots were favoured by the hunting, shooting, fishing set.

When Kate Moss rocked up to Glastonbury festival 2005 in a pair of Hunters teamed with denim cut-offs, she created the staple shorts and Wellie 'festival chic' combo. 

The look is much admired by many of the 2,500 Debenhams customers quizzed in the online poll and makes it on the list in fifth place.

Girl band All Saints' sexing-up of combat trousers, complete the top five of the ten most memorable moments which have swayed our fashion choices. 

The return of the shoulder pad in 2010 saw their resurgence as many young women imitated artists such as Lady Gaga and Rihanna in their 1980s style jackets with exaggerated shoulders, who in turn paid homage to the mothers of 'Power Dressing'; Dallas and Dynasty's Joan Collins, Linda Evans and Victoria Principal.

Still on the American theme, the double-denim red carpet look from Britney Spears and her-then-partner Justin Timberlake at the 2001 American Music Awards proved unforgettable for some, coming in at number nine on the list.

Royal Princess, Beatrice and her 'pretzel' hat brought a smile to the faces of many at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding in 2011 and made it to number ten in the poll. 

Created by Debenhams' first Designer, Philip Treacy, the titfer raised more than a few eyebrows - proving she's a good sport, Bea later sold the tea rose silk headgear on eBay and made £81,100 for charity.

A spokesperson said: 'Our customers have a keen eye for fashion and it was great fun to find out what they thought were the most memorable fashion moments since 1993 when the ground-breaking Designers at Debenhams concept was born.

'For the first time fashion fans could find bona-fide designer clothing in a high street department store. In one fell swoop designer wear became both accessible and affordable, an achievement we are very proud of.

'By bringing designer fashion to the high street, the retailer has given designers a much-needed commercial outlet which spans across every category from footwear to furniture.'
