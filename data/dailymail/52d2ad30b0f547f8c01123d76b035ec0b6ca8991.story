Clare Balding has abandoned the Grand National to host the Boat Race

Clare Balding will abandon the Grand National next month to host the Boat Race because it is the first time coverage will also include the women’s race.

The date of the Oxford-Cambridge rowing race clashes with the Aintree event, which she has covered for 21 years.

The Bafta-winning presenter, 44, told the Racing Post: ‘I knew I couldn’t do the Grand National because of the Boat Race. 

'I have not been quiet about my commitment to women’s sport and next year will be a really historic moment because the Women’s Boat Race will be on TV for the very first time.

'I would have liked to do both events, but whereas I’ve covered the last 21 Grand Nationals I’ve never covered the Women’s Boat Race.

‘I felt I couldn’t say all I say about women in sport and then not be there that first time the women are on the tideway.’

Yesterday one of her Twitter followers, Kev Doolan, wrote: ‘Still can’t believe you are doing the Boat Race over the Grand National #deserter.’

She responded: ‘For the record, the Grand National doesn’t need my help, women’s sport does.’

After Mr Doolan said he was upset she was leaving the Grand National after 21 years because she was such a good presenter, she added: ‘You’re very kind but it’s a very good team at C4 and I don’t think you’ll even notice I’m not there. And I believe that sometimes you’ve got to do something unexpected to make your point. My point being women’s sport matters.’ 

She added: ‘It’s a very good team and I don’t think you’ll even notice I’m not there. I believe sometimes you’ve got to do something unexpected to make your point. My point being women’s sport matters.’

Miss Balding has long been an advocate of women’s sport and believes that in recent years female athletes have been taken more seriously. 

She told The Independent last year: ‘I’ve felt that, especially since London 2012, the demand for a variety of women’s sport is there from the public.

‘They’re interested, they’re engaged and I have the feeling that in the next ten years we are going to see a massively changed cultural landscape.

Broadcaster Balding has been covering the Grand National at Aintree for 21 years

‘At school I remember saying to my careers teacher that I wanted to be an eventer. She thought I’d said “inventor”. When I corrected her and told her my ambition was to go to the Olympics she just silently passed on to the next girl, while everyone else in the class laughed.

‘I would like to think nowadays if any girl said they wanted to be an equestrian, an athlete, a swimmer, a footballer or a cricketer, that would be taken seriously as a career option and they would be properly supported and advised.’
