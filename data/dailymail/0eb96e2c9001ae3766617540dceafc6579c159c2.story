A Kansas judge is expected to make a ruling on whether a sperm donor who answered a Craigslist ad and signed away parental rights is responsible for child support.

William Marotta and his wife are fighting the state’s efforts to seek child support from him after the Topeka mechanic provided sperm to a lesbian couple in 2009 for the purposes of artificial insemination. A decision is expected by the end of the year.

Mr Marotta found the couple through an ad on Craigslist and signed a contract voiding his parental rights. The state of Kansas alleges he is the father and owes support, he is fighting that claim.

Lawyers for the state are moving to have Mr Marotta named the child’s father and have even requested a DNA test, which he said is not necessary because he is the father, according to the Topeka Capital-Journal.

Though not contesting his blood relation to the child, Mr Marotta has argued the contract he signed with Angela Bauer and Jennifer Shriner disavowing his parental rights voids his monetary responsibility for the child.

The state’s position is that since the semen donation was not made through a licensed physician, rather through the use of a catheter and syringe after he provided the semen sample in a cup, that Mr Marotta’s responsibility to the child is the same as if he fathered the child naturally.

'This is not a case about a sperm donor contract, it’s about child support,' Timothy Keck. an attorney for the state, said Friday, according to NBC News.

'[Marotta] cannot get out of his support obligations because he didn’t follow state law,' Mr Keck continued. 'The contract they drew up means nothing.''

State lawyers have cited a statute they believe pertains to this case as the reason for proving Mr Marotta’s need to pay child support.

‘The donor of semen provided to a licensed physician for use in artificial insemination of a woman other than the donor’s wife is treated in law as if he were not the birth father of a child thereby conceived, unless agreed to in writing by the donor and the woman,’ the law states.

Mr Marotta’s lawyers argued that since this donation was done outside the presence of a doctor, the law has no application, nor does it provide guidance for how to proceed in such a case, according to the paper.

The case ended up in court after Mr Marotta was ordered last year to pay child support to the couple, which has since split up.

Lawyers for both sides have moved for a summary judgement in the matter, relinquishing their right to a trial, and have said they expect a decision by the end of the year.
