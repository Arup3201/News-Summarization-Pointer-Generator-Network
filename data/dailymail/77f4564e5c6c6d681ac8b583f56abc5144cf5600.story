Zara Phillips made the most of the early spring sunshine, spending this afternoon at an charity eventing meet in Cambridgeshire.

After completing her heats, the 33-year-old royal spent the rest of the day relaxing with friends at the Whitehall Farm Event Complex, near Ely.

Zara entered two of her horses into the trials, Hunua and High Kingdom - which she won a silver medal on in the 2012 Olympics.

After a busy few hours competing in the dressage, show jumping and cross country heats, the professional equestrienne then changed into a windbreaker and dark blue baseball cap to relax with friends at the outdoor cafe.

The two-day event was held to raise money for the Addenbrooke’s Charitable Trust, which supports Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge. 

Zara's daughter Mia, one, who often accompanies her mother to horse shows, was absent from the day's event, as was Zara's husband Mike Tindall, 36. 

On top of their high-profile work commitments,Mike and Zara have a lot on their hands at the moment renovating their new home.

The couple, who married in 2011, live on Princess Anne's Gatcombe Estate with their young daughter Mia, born last year.

But it was reported recently that they are set to revamp a Grade II listed farmhouse where Zara's father, Captain Mark Phillips, had been living since his divorce from Anne in 1992.

Once a high-tech renovation has been carried out on Aston Farm, set in 600 acres on the Princess Royal’s estate, the young family will move in.
