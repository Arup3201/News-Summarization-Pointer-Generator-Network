He may be struggling to find the back of the net since his £16million move  to Liverpool in the summer, but Mario Balotelli appears to have no problem locating London's nightclubs.

The misfiring striker was spotted partying the night away at celebrity haunt Libertine on Saturday - hours after his team folded in a 2-1 defeat by Premier League table-toppers Chelsea.

In fact, the 24-year-old appeared quite dedicated to soaking up as much of the British capital's night-life as he could, staying at the club until 4:30am.

Mario Balotelli was at London nightclub Libertine on Saturday after his Liverpool side lost to Chelsea

As he finally made his exit, Mario appeared intent on going incognito, attempting to cover his face with the hood of his velvet black sleeveless top as he walked underneath a large red umbrella.

The flamboyant star dressed in his usual eye-catching style, opting for an all-black ensemble that would have captured attention even if he hadn't been one of the football world's better known faces.

Former Manchester City player Balotelli had his arms on full display, thanks to the fitted top under his black-and-gold outerwear.

He teamed it with a pair of cropped black harem trousers, while he strode along in a pair of metallic hi-tops, giving just as much shine as the selection of gold chains adorning his neck.

Since his headline-making move to Liverpool this season, the Italy international has scored for the Reds just twice - against Swansea in the League Cup and Ludogorets in the Champions League.

Despite his struggles to find his feet, he has been recalled to the Italy squad - the first time he has been selected by new manager Antonio Conte.

At the start of the season, Balotelli was signed to Liverpool in a £16million transfer from AC Milan

Meanwhile, former Italy manager Arrigo Sacchi recently criticised the controversial star.

'Balotelli is not a player, because a player moves as part of a team,' Arrigo explained. 'He's just a footballer.'

Italy will host Croatia in a crunch Euro 2016 qualifier at the San Siro on Sunday, before taking on Albania in a friendly at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris on November 18, set to raise funds for those affected by recent floods in Genoa.

Balotelli will be looking to open his Premier League account  against Crystal Palace FC later this month
