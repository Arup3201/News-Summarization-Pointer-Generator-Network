Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are on death row with seven other convicted criminals, with all expected to face the firing squad in the next round of killings.

Six of the other people awaiting execution are also foreigners and, despite having the support of their respective countries, are expected to be executed at Nusakambangan island in the coming weeks.

It is unclear how long the delay on the executions will last.

The drug felons' prospects are dire as they all have convictions in Indonesia, a country with some of the toughest drug laws in the world. The country executed six drug offenders last month, five of them foreigners.

Many political figures continue to appeal for clemency with Indonesian President Joko Widodo.

However, Widodo is a staunch supporter of capital punishment and pleas have repeatedly been unsuccessful.

As Chan and Sukumaran await news about their fate, so too do six men and one woman; including a single mother-of-two, a father-of-four and a man with serious mental illnesses.

The only woman set to be executed is a Filipino single mother-of-two, Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso.

Philippine death row prisoner Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso is a single mother-of-two. She was arrested in April 2010 in Yogyakarta airport for attempting to smuggle 2.6 kilograms of heroin and now awaits her execution

Coming from a poor rural family, she was just 25-years-old when she was arrested in 2010 with 2.6 kilograms of heroin in her luggage. 

She was transporting two suitcases from Malaysia to Indonesia to earn money for her family and maintains that she did not know the luggage contained heroin.

She speaks only Tagalog and has had extensive difficulties in court due to her inability to understand proceedings.

Another inmate at Nusakamgangan prison island is French national Serge Atlaoui.

Atlaoui is a father-of-four who was arrested near Jakarta in 2005 whilst working in a secret laboratory producing ecstasy. He was sentenced to death in 2007 on drug trafficking charges.

Imprisoned in Indonesia for ten years, he has always maintained his innocence. He is adamant that he was installing industrial machinery in what he thought was an acrylics factory.

He claims that by the time he realised the factory was manufacturing drugs it was too late.

The 51-year-old has the unwavering support of his wife Sabine, who has sworn to continue to fight for his release. She is certain of her husband's innocence.

'He is scared that he will never see his children again,' said Ms Atlaoui. She is still 'holding onto hope'.

French President Francois Hollande wrote to President Widodo last month asking for Atlaoui to be granted a reprieve but his efforts were futile.

Atlaoui's wife Sabine travelled to visit her husband in prison with a young boy on March 5. She has campaigned for her husband's release. He is scared that he will never see his four children again

Brazilian national Rodrigo Gularte, 42, was arrested in 2004 for attempting to smuggle six kilograms of cocaine into Indonesia.

His family continue to appeal for a pardon due to his mental illnesses. Gularte has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with psychotic features and is reportedly deeply disturbed.

Sadly due to his paranoid schizophrenia, Gularte believes that there is a microchip in his arm and he is being monitored by satellites, according to news.com.au

He also believes that he works in security at the prison and refuses all medication and treatment.

He is a surfer from an affluent family and has the full support of his devastated family.

The Brazillian President removed the country's ambassador from Indonesia in January after their citizen Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira was executed.

In 1999 Nigerian Jaimu Owolabi Abashin was sentenced to life in prison, a year after he was caught smuggling 5.3 kilograms of heroin through Indonesia's Juanda airport.

For seven years he believed that there was a chance he could walk free. 

However in May 2006 a judge ordered his execution and he was not given an opportunity to appeal.

When first arrested, he purported to be a Spaniard named Raheem Agbaje Salami and held a fake passport.

17 years after his arrest, Indonesian authorities continue to use the man's false identity. It has been reported that the Nigerian joked about the mix-up with Australians Chan and Sukumaran last week through their cell walls on the island where they will be executed.

Like Chan and Sukumaran, lawyers for Nigerian death row inmate Raheem Agbaje Salami failed to have a challenge against his clemency rejection heard in the administrative court on Monday.

Nigerian death row prisoner Raheem Agbaje Salami has already made friends with Chan and Sukumaran 

Silvester Obiekwe is another Nigerian on death row. He was arrested in 2003 for smuggling 1.2 kilograms of heroin into Indonesia, discovered with 66 capsules in his stomach. 

He is a 'priority' for execution as he has since been caught operating drug syndicates whilst on death row.

Another Nigerian man, Okwudili Ayotanze, could also possibly join the 10 on death row to face the firing squad with Chan and Sukumaran.

He was caught trying to smuggle 1.15 kilograms of heroin from Pakistan into Jakarta. However, he has now become a gospel singer. He performs with prison guards and has released an album from behind bars.

Martin Anderson is a man from Ghana and was sentenced to death in June 2004 after he was convicted for possessing 50 grams of heroin in Jakarta in 2003.

It is understood that in 11 years a Ghanaian official has never visited him. 

The final person is Zainal Abidin, the sole Indonesian citizen. He was first sentenced to 15 years in jail in September 2001 when he was captured smuggling 58.7 kilograms of marijuana.

Three months later, following an appeal the Palembang High Court increased his sentence, handing him the death penalty.
