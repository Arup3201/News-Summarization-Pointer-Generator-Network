Jo-Wilfried Tsonga has pulled out of the Australian Open with a persistent arm injury.

The 29-year-old Frenchman, who also withdrew from this week's Hopman Cup with the same complaint, confirmed on Twitter that the start of his season will be delayed.

He described the latest blow as a 'big disappointment' and posted a picture of his right arm, complete with a brace stretching from the base of his hand to the middle of his forearm.

The two-time Wimbledon semi-finalist struggled with the injury during France's Davis Cup final defeat to Switzerland in November and is hoping the extra rest will help him make a complete recovery.

'I'm still suffering from a forearm inflammation (intersection syndrome) and that prevents me being at 100 per cent of my capacities in a competition,' Tsonga said on his official website.

'Then I'm going to receive over 3 weeks all the needed treatments to be able to be back on track in the best conditions.'

Tsonga was only able to contest one rubber during the Davis Cup final but still chose to play in the inaugural International Premier Tennis League.

That decision will now come under renewed scrutiny while US Open champion Marin Cilic, another player who went into the IPTL carrying an injury, is also a major doubt for the season's first grand slam.
