The woman who accused Florida State University star Jameis Winston of raping her has  come forward for a new documentary that premiered Friday at the Sundance Film Festival.

Eric Kinsman, 20, speaks publicly in the film for the first time, claiming she came to after drinking at a bar to find Winston on top of her having sex in his apartment while she pleaded with him to stop.

In the film, Kinsman says one of Winston's roommates also allegedly begged him to stop before the quarterback took her into the bathroom and pinned her head to the floor to continue the assault.

The Daily Beast reports that Kinsman is featured in Kirby Dick's documentary The Hunting Ground, which casts a critical eye on the role that fraternities, athletic departments and schools play in rape investigations on campus.

Kinsman fights tears as she details her account of the  December 2012 night, when as a freshman, she remembers running into a man at a Tallahassee Potbelly's.

She says someone was creepily following her around the bar throughout the night and only stopped when a second man put his arm around her and told her pursuer he was her boyfriend.

Kinsman says that man then bought her a shot, after which she began to feel dizzy, though she faintly recalls taking a cab to an apartment.

She says the next thing she remembers is coming to while the man on top of her penetrating her, and claims that she asked him to stop.

The man allegedly ignored both her and his roommate, who Kinsman says entered the room and told him to stop, and took her into the bathroom.

Acceptable conduct: Winston has avoided criminal charges, and a Florida State University conduct code hearing found there was not enough evidence to determine whether he was guilty

Stepping forward: Kinsman spoke publicly for the first time about the alleged assault in the documentary The Hunting Ground, about rape on campus, which premiered Friday at the Sundance Film Festival

Shattered: Kinsman's family has said she was an A student that had to drop out of FSU, leave Tallahassee and undergo therapy after the night she claims she was raped by Winston

Star player: A month after prosecutors decided there was not enough evidence to pursue criminal charges, Winston led the Seminoles to a comeback victory against Auburn in the BCS title game

There, she says, he raped her while he held her head against the tiles, and when he was finished told her 'You can leave now.' 

Not knowing where the apartment was, Kinsman says she took an offer for a ride on the man's scooter back to a location she recognized, fearing what would happen if he knew where she lived.  

According to a New York Times investigation of the ensuing police investigation, Kinsman reported the assault in the early morning immediately after it happened, but did not identify the assailant.

Tallahassee Police Officer Scott Angulo wrote he 'had no real leads' until Kinsman contacted police a month later, saying she saw the man in class and heard his name called, identifying him as Winston.

Dick, who also directed The Invisible War, about a lack of accountability when prosecuting sexual assault in the US military, rips into the investigation in The Hunting Ground.

The film asserts Angulo, an FSU grad who had worked for the Seminole Boosters, not only failed to identify Winston, but did not obtain DNA evidence, cell phone records or interviews with witnesses.

The Arizona-born documentary filmmaker has tackled America's attitude toward sex and sexuality and taken aim at powerful institutions like the Catholic Church and the US military.

The 2004 film Twist of Faith depicts a man suing the parish where a priest sexually abused him as a child - and the heartbreaking reactions of his friends and family.

Outrage, released in 2009, asserted closeted gay politicians help drive lobbying for anti-gay legislation.

He caused a shake-up in the way the US military handled cases of sexual assault after his 2012 film The Invisible War exposed the armed services' failures to hold rapists in their ranks accountable.

The officer also allegedly failed to get recordings from Potbelly's 30 security cameras or get a cell phone video Winston's roommate, football player Chris Casher, later admitted to recording of the sexual act. 

By the time State Attorney William Meggs took over the investigation, nine months after Tallahassee police closed it, the tapes had been recycled and the cell phone video deleted, according to the film.

Meggs eventually wrapped up the investigation in December 2013 with no charges filed, though DNA on Kinsman's shorts matched that of Winston.

'I think things that happened that night were not good,' Meggs says in The Hunting Ground, though there was insufficient evidence to support criminal charges.

A FOX Sports investigation reported in October that Tallahassee police helped FSU officials stay ahead of any prosecution by the state attorney.

The university's chief of police received original and supplemental reports four days before the case was handed off to Meggs, according to documents obtained.

These reports were then forwarded to an FSU athletics department official, who provided them to Winston's defense attorney before the case was passed to prosecutors, the investigation found.

Two witnesses, football players who watched Winston engaging in a sexual act with Kinsman, spoke to Winston's lawyer and were convinced to sign affidavits in support of Winston's account of the night - before police ever interviewed them.

Hunting Ground: The documentary is an expose on the way fraternities, athletic departments and universities affect rape investigations

Connect the dots: A group of activists and rape survivors are featured in the film, which reportedly asserts that colleges try to protect their brand above all else in sexual assault cases

After no criminal charges were put forward by prosecutors, the school was forced under Title IX to conduct its own investigation, ESPN reports.

In a series of hearings, Winston admitted he had met Kinsman at Potbelly's and had sex with her, but that it was consensual.

The quarterback said he danced with her for about 10 minutes, got her telephone number and then contacted her later that night.

December 7, 2012 - Erica Kinsman files a police report claiming she was raped, though she can not identify the attacker.

January 10, 2013 - She tells Tallahassee police she recognizes Winston as the assailant in a class and hears a professor call his name.

November 13, 2013 - Prosecutor Willie Meggs is notified of the allegations and pushes police on an investigation, during which key witnesses are interviewed and evidence is sought. 

November 2013 - Kinsman drops out of FSU, later claiming she received death threats for making charges of rape. 

December 5, 2013 - Meggs decides against pursuing criminal charges, saying that evidence is insufficient. 

December 14, 2013 - Winston wins the Heisman Trophy, becoming the youngest player, at 19, to do so.

January 6, 2014 - Winston and the Seminoles win the BCS championship against Auburn.

December 21, 2014 - FSU clears Winston of any code of conduct violations after hearing presided over by retired Florida Supreme Court Justice Major Harding. 

Winston said that she climbed into the taxi voluntarily and rode with him and two other football players to his apartment, where she consented to give him oral sex and then have intercourse.

After being asked by retired Florida Supreme Court Justice Major Harding what he considered physical and verbal consent for sex, Winston said 'moaning.'

Winston's lawyer, David Cornwell, delivered a brief to Harding that called Kinsman unreliable, bringing up that she she did not originally report the more violent episode in the bathroom to police.

Kinsman responded to claims she changed her accounts by saying she tried to always give accounts as she remembered them, and said she had been harassed repeatedly.

'I was subjected to a number of death threats, and my parents' home and work addresses were posted online,' she said according to the transcript produced at the hearing.

'I have had my most horrible life experience played out and debated in local and national media that couldn't care a less about me.' 

Her family told the Times that it was Kinsman's dream to attend FSU, where she was studying as a pre-med, but dropped out in November after her identity was revealed.

In the film, Kinsman claims she dealt with classmates at the university harassing her because she had made the accusation that pointed back at Winston.

'All these people were praising [Winston]… and calling me a slut, a whore,' she says in the film.  

In January 2014, Winston was standing behind center at the two-yard line and took a snap, executing a play-action pass that erased an Auburn lead in the final seconds.

The final scoring drive sealed the Seminoles' fourth-quarter comeback and delivered the BCS national title to FSU.

For Winston, who had become the youngest Heisman winner in December, it also capped off a history-making season that FSU and police had allowed to remain undisturbed.

The Hunting Ground, produced by CNN Films and RADiUS, will be released to theaters in March as well as air on CNN.
