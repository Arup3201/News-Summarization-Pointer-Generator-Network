Two Boston College students studying in Rome have shared their joy after exchanging skull caps with Pope Francis in front of the Vatican.

Katherine Rich, from Minnetonka, Minnesota, and Ethan Mack, from Portland, Maine, were waiting along the barricades near St Peter's Square with a skullcap - called a zucchetto - on Wednesday as the Pope approached.

The philosophy students, who are studying abroad for just a semester, had attached a note to the zucchetto reading: 'Boston College loves our Jesuit pope.'

'We thought he wouldn’t see us, but we both yelled, "Papa!" and at that second he turned around, saw us, and asked the driver to stop,' Rich, 20, from Minnetonka, Minnesota, told the Boston Globe.

Excitement: Katherine Rich and Ethan Mack, who are students at Boston College, received a skullcap from Pope Francis in exchange for one they presented him. The American students are studying in Rome

They held out the zucchetto, which Mack had bought the night before for around $68, and the pope sent over a guard who took it to him, they explained in an email on Thursday.

Francis smiled at the note and put on the cap after making sure it was the right size and then he handed his own zucchetto to the guard.

'The pope then gave a nod and smiled right at us,' said Mack, 21, said in an email. 'He took off with the one I bought, and the guard gave us his original one.'

The Rev. Thomas Rosica, chief executive of the Salt and Light Catholic Television Network in Toronto, told the Boston Globe that popes have made this gesture often in the past.

Generosity: The pope tested the size of the cap - called a zucchetto - before giving his to the students

'It's a wonderful gesture,' Rosica said. 'It's a way of him reaching out to people.'

Rich and Mack said they got the idea 
from friends studying at Providence College and the Catholic University 
of America, who had tried to trade the zuchettos, but they'd been the 
wrong size.

Mack explained that it was his last chance for an interaction with the Pope, who was heading to his weekly mass, because he and Rich are retuning back to the U.S. soon.

'It was a gamble, because this was our last audience,' Mack said. 'Getting close is just a matter of getting to the audience early. If you do, you can get on the perimeter of a barricade and he will drive right along.'

The pair said they do not know exactly what they will do with the zuchetto but they plan on presenting it to the school or giving it away.

Rich added: 'The best part of the whole encounter 
was just seeing Pope Francis smile at us. He radiates joy 
in a way unlike anyone else.'

Chance: They waved the zuchetto at the pope as he drove in St Peter's Square (pictured last week)

Francis, who took over the papacy in March, has given many public displays of respect and compassion, and has received praise from Catholics and non-Catholics alike.

In November, he was pictured embracing Vinicio Riva, whose body is covered with large, painful growths. Following the experience, Riva said the display of compassion 'felt like paradise'.

And following Easter Mass at the Vatican, a family from Rhode Island were moved to tears when the pope held up their son Dominic Gondreau, who suffers from cerebral palsy, and kissed him.

He was also named person of the year on Wednesday by Time magazine.

The managing editor praised him 'for committing the world’s largest church to confronting its deepest needs and for balancing judgment with mercy'.
