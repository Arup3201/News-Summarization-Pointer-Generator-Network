Erik Lamela’s 20-yard rabona against Asteras Tripolis on Thursday night was an ostentatious display of genius that took the breath away and had manager Mauricio Pochettino proclaiming it the best goal ever scored by one of his players.

It was, said Pochettino, a goal that could only have been scored by a player of Lamela’s skill. Long time supporters of the Argentine recognised the technique.

There is grainy footage on YouTube of him scoring from a rabona as a young teenager, playing in a junior game for River Plate in his homeland.

But what is the wider history of the rabona? It is defined as striking the ball when the kicking leg is wrapped around the back of the standing leg - effectively with one's legs crossed.

Particularly popular among players of South American origin, the first rabona was scored in 1948 by striker Ricardo Infante in a game between Argentinian teams Estudiantes de la Plata and Rosario Central.

But it was Italian winger Giovanni Roccotelli who made the showboating act his own and later became revered as 'il padre della rabona,’ or ‘the father of the rabona’.

When interviewed in the 1990s Roccotelli said: ‘In every game the fans begged me to do it, they expected it. For me it was a natural thing.

'I began crossing like this when I was very little. At least I did one thing before all the others.

'Now they call this move "rabona" because Ronaldo did it, but Pele himself said in an interview that he remembered an Italian doing it before him: that was me.’

Ronaldo and Pele perfected the technique but we could be seeing plenty more rabona in the Premier League this season.

Manchester United new boys Marcos Rojo and particularly Angel di Maria are renowned for their sublime rabona kicks.

Di Maria performs rabona kicks to pass and score, while Rojo even employed a rabona to clear his own penalty area in a World Cup match for Argentina against Bosnia-Herzegovina this summer.

PS. Don’t try this trick if you’ve not already nailed it on the training ground. Yes, we’re looking at you David Dunn.

The Birmingham midfielder attempted a rabona pass in a match against Aston Villa.

He embarrassingly got the ball caught between his legs and ended up in an messy pile in the middle of the pitch, in a move replayed millions of times on the internet and one which Dunn is surely reminded of at regular intervals.
