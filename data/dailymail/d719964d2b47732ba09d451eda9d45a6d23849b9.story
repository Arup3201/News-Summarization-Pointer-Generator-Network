Brian Broughton had the end of his nose bitten off during the attack last March 

A violent thug who bit off a man's nose as he walked to work has been jailed for 12 years. 

Brian Broughton, a father-of-one, was on his way to his factory job in Benton, Newcastle, when he was attacked by David Robson in March. 

After starting a fight with the 24-year-old, Robson bit off the tip of his nose and spat it out on to grass.

The 22-year-old, who was on bail at the time of the attack for a separate violent incident, was jailed for 12 years at Newcastle Crown Court on August 29. 

Speaking after Judge Simon Hickey's sentencing, Mr Broughty recalled the moment he saw his nose 'flattened' on the ground. 

'I ended up having a fight with him, but then I realised it wasn't going to be a fist fight.

'He didn't want to fight me, he wanted to bite me,' he said of Robson, who he is thought to have known for years.  

'I was half knocked out and stunned. Then I realised he was biting my nose,' he said. 

'I was shouting and screaming. It was some pain. I was just in shock.

'You just don’t expect someone to do that. 

'Real men don’t bite people.' 

'When I found my nose it was flattened and covered in mud and little stones.

'I had it in my hand. I can remember when the ambulance pulled up I was trying not to look at the window because I didn’t want to see my reflection. 

'I was scared to look.'

Doctors at the Royal Victoria Infirmary were able to reattach the nose but Mr Broughton is still awaiting plastic surgery. 

'I’m back to normal now. 

'I’m back at work and everything is fine. I just want to get on with my life now,' added Mr Broughton. 

'My nose has not fully healed but it’s much better. 

'You can’t really tell anymore. It’s kind of grown back by itself so it’s not a bad as it first looked.'

At the time of the attack Robson was already on bail for an alleged stabbing in June 2013.

The 24-year-old father-of-one was on his way to work when he encountered David Robson (right) in the street. After the pair began fighting, he realised Robson had latched his teeth onto his face and wouldn't let go

The court heard how the 22-year-old was involved in an incident in which a man was stabbed under his arm. 

On August 29 Robson was jailed for eight years for the incident in March with a 34 month concurrent sentence for the prior attack. 

Judge Hickey however extended the first sentence by four years after considering the danger the man posed to society. 

A Northumbria Police spokesman said: 'This man is now facing the consequences of his violent actions. 

'Let this serve as warning to others that violence is not acceptable and we will take action.'
