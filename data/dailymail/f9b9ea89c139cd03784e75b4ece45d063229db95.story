A man claiming to be the illegitimate son of Mr. T filed a $5.4 million lawsuit last year claiming that the TV star had abandoned him at a young age causing him to become emotionally unstable and join a gang.

In the legal papers,  Alexander Taylor, 25, of San Diego, California, claimed that the actor - real name Laurence Tureaud - walked out of his life because ‘he did not fit into Mr. T’s public image.’

According to the June 2013 lawsuit, Taylor ‘was born May 25, 1988 to Vanessa Taylor (mother) and Mr. T (father)’.

Actor Mr. T - real name Laurence Tureaud - has been accused of walking out on his 'illegitimate son' Alexander Taylor, right, who filed a lawsuit against him last year

Taylor claims ‘Mr. T had a 
responsibility and obligation as a father to help provide Alexander with
 the basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter’, but instead he chose 
to ‘neglect and abuse’ him during his childhood, reports RadarOnline.

‘Perhaps
 things would be different if Alexander did not know his father; Mr. T 
spent quite a bit of time with Alexander for example Mr. T would take 
Alexander to preschool,’ state the document.

Born-again
 Christian Mr. T rose to prominence in the 1980s playing the iconic role
 of B.A. Baracus - the mohican-haired mercenary weighed down by gold 
neck chains and a phobia of flying – in the hit TV show The A-Team.

‘At the time Alexander was unaware that his father was famous, he was just a proud little boy… Then all of a sudden Mr. T walked out of Alexander’s life and never looked back.’

In the papers Taylor also claims that the only thing the actor taught him was 'how to pee standing up'.

As a result of being abandoned, Taylor states that he had a hard time transitioning into adulthood and was suspended numerous times from school and was sent to juvenile hall before he eventually joined a gang.

‘Mr. T’s emotional child abuse has caused emotional distress resulting in more serious psychological and behavioral problems.

'These include depression, lack of attachment or emotional bond to family and friends, low cognitive ability and poor social skills,’ the lawsuit continued.

Taylor even requesting a jury trial, but
 the suit was dismissed two months later because Taylor failed to pay 
the required $400 filing and administrative fee.

When Mail Online spoke to Taylor he revealed that he has taken his case to the Court of Appeal.

The lawsuit wasn’t the first time that Taylor’s family had attempted some legal recourse against Mr. T.

In
 1990, Alexander’s mom Vanessa Taylor - who like Mr. T hails from 
Chicago - filed a Petition to Establish Parentage regarding Alexander.

That case was filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, but had been mysteriously taken of the court docket by 1994.

Mr. T married Phyllis Clark in 1971 and they have three children - Lesa, Erika, and T Junior.

Taylor was arrested ten times between 2007 and 2009 for a string of unspecified offenses.
