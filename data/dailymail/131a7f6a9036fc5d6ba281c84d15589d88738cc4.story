Is Yaya right to be angry over birthday snub?

Now share your opinion

Yaya Toure risks further enraging Manchester City after admitting he wants to end his career at Barcelona and could leave the club this summer.

The 31-year-old's future at the Etihad Stadium is shrouded in doubt after a bizarre episode on Tuesday when his agent Dimitry Seluk launched an inexplicable attack on the Premier League champions.

The Ukrainian claimed Toure - who cost City £24million four years ago - was ready to leave after the club 'snubbed' his birthday last week.

Ambition: Toure has been linked with a return 'home' to Barcelona after a lack of respect from City

Happy return? Toure has indicated that he wants to end his career back at Barcelona, who sold him for £24m

Comments: Toure's agent Dimitri Seluk has been in the public eye over the last week

Slice it up: The controversial cake

City have kept their counsel up until now and will block any attempt to lever a move but Toure himself has confirmed that he wants out.

Asked on beIN SPORTS whether he could be playing for another club: 'Yes, I have talked before about ending my career at Barcelona - but we don't know because football is moving fast and you never know about tomorrow.

'Because of the brilliant season Manchester City have had, everybody is talking about me and everything is open and we don't know tomorrow.'

Worryingly for City fans - who face the prospect of losing their talisman on a triviality - the Ivorian reiterated his endorsement of Seluk's actions.

'Dimitry is always on the phone and he knows what he has to do because I trust him a lot,' he added.

'The main thing now is just to try and focus on the World Cup and he knows what he has to do because we were always open about everything and I am able to talk with him for a couple of days now.'

Toure and Seluk's relationship is a strong one; the player has been under him for the majority of his career, calls him 'dad' and named his second child after him.

Sticking the knife in? Toure's cake was dwarfed by that of Manchester City's owners celebrating the title

Sliding in: Despite the outburst, Toure is paid handsomely by City, north of £200,000-a-week

And they are no strangers to causing 
mischief within Carrington. Seluk has overtly poked City enough in the 
past to cajole more money for his client in the past.

Toure
 is now sitting on more than £200,000-a-week and accused the club of treating him 
as a 'nobody' at a party attended by owner Sheik Mansour and other 
dignitaries in Abu Dhabi last Tuesday.

Complaints
 over a lack of a birthday cake by the central midfielder's 
representative stretch the truth somewhat; he was handed two - one on a 
flight and another at the team's hotel - while a Facebook message 
received 250,000 'likes' from supporters.

There is a sense in the North West that, although he is seen as a peripheral figure, Seluk can't help himself.

And that became even more apparent when he went full throttle in the media this week.

Fast car: Seluk noted that Roberto Carlos was bought a Bugatti by Russian club Anzhi on his birthday

‘There is a big possibility that Yaya 
will leave this summer,’ Seluk said. ‘He is very upset. What happened at
 his birthday means the club don’t care about him. It was proof.

‘In
 a normal team, his team-mates and club would at least give him good 
wishes. But when you have a big party to celebrate the title and no one 
comes to Yaya to say, "Happy Birthday", what more do you want?

‘He got a cake but when it was Roberto Carlos’s birthday, the president of Anzhi gave him a Bugatti.

Snub: Toure was upset by Pellegrini not giving him a birthday message

‘The club’s owners ate a 100kg cake 
after winning the Premier League but when they and the players were all 
together, none of them shook his hand on his birthday. It shows they 
don’t care about him. This isn’t about a new contract — it’s about human
 relationships and City have shown they don’t respect him.

‘If
 a player like Yaya went to Liverpool and they won the league for the 
first time in 24 years, Yaya would be a god in Liverpool. But at City 
Yaya is no hero. He’s nobody. That’s how the club make him feel.

‘He’s
 very upset and he started thinking about leaving the club. And he will 
if things carry on like this. If you ask 100 per cent or 50-50, better 
50-50 than 100. This is not about money. In fact, he would take less to 
return to Barcelona. All the staff at Barcelona, and players, liked him.
 He felt like Barcelona was his home.’
