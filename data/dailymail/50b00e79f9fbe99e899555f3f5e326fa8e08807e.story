Drones have been snooping on people and places from the air for some time, but until now they have largely been unable to reveal aquatic goings on.

The HexH2o claims to be a commercial waterproof drone that can land on water so its camera can film what is going on below the waves.

The drone’s pilot can control the camera to capture videos of fish or whatever else is living in a sea or lake.

Revolutionary? The HexH2o claims to be the world’s first commercial waterproof drone that houses a gimbal allowing users to capture footage through its large viewing dome both in the air and underwater (pictured)

Engineers at Thailand-based QuadH2O are selling the drone in kit form, as well as in pre-made ‘ready to fly’ form.

The drone has six propellers so it’s easily manoeuvrable and has a fibre composite body, making it strong but lightweight.

It’s designed to carry the GoPro 3 and 4 camera and has a gimbal to ensure videos are stable when they are shot both above and below water.

The 'viewing dome' protecting the camera is made of perspex, while other parts are 3D printed or crafted from carbon.

Screwdrivers at the ready! The HexH2o comes in kit form, pictured, and or ready-made. ‘All you need to do it add your chosen flight battery, strap on your GoPro, make a few checks, calibrate your compass and fly,’ the firm said of its more expensive option

Filming: Aerial shots and underwater footage are possible using a gimbal and GoPro3 or 4.

Rotors: Six, with fold-able arms.

Flight time: Up to 25 minutes.

Speed: The drone is fast and agile, to keep up with speed boats and jet skis.

Weight: 10.4 lbs (4.7kg) when fully loaded. 

It's been designed to be a sealed, water-tight unit, with the exception of two 'breather tubes' which allow the barometer to measure outside air pressure.

The makers say: ‘You can land and take off from water and even manoeuvre on the water allowing you to capture amazing “underwater” footage before flying away.’

Flight time depends on flight conditions, as well as how the components are set up, but the drone can fly or 'swim' for up to 25 minutes.

Fully loaded, the drone weighs 10.4 lbs (4.7kg) and can be controlled using a DJI Naza, which is the most popular flight controller for multirotor drones.

The HexH2o pre-order costs were listed at $895 (£588) in kit form and $979 (£644) ready-made, but retail prices will be released next week.
