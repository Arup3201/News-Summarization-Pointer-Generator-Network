Carl Froch's hopes of fighting Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in a $50million Las Vegas send-off have suffered a potential setback.

The Mexican's promoter, Bob Arum, is currently negotiating a new deal with his fighter and expects him to return in September or October.

But he wants Chavez to face the hard-hitting Kazakh Gennady Golovkin, rather than Froch, as reported by Boxing Scene.

'Gennady Golovkin will continue to be the first choice assuming he beats [Daniel] Geale, and if Chavez says no to Golovkin, then we'll look to Froch,' Arum told Boxing Scene.

Froch retained his super-middleweight world titles last weekend with a stunning eighth-round knockout of George Groves in front of 80,000 fans at Wembley.

The Nottingham Cobra has admitted he could hang up his gloves but dreams of finishing his career in the fight capital of the world.

But he might have to wait until next year if Chavez agrees to fight Golovkin, a fight that had been mooted for this summer before negotiations stalled.

Option: Froch has targetted a Las Vegas send-off against Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr

Golovkin instead defends his WBA Super and IBO middleweight titles against former world champion Geale in New York's Madison Square Garden on July 26.

And Golovkin's trainer Abel Sanchez is confident his charge would beat Froch if the two were to meet.

'Froch is a gallant warrior, but makes too mistakes and if the fight can be made, I see Golovkin capitalising on them to stop him in the last part of the fight,' he told World Boxing News.

Another option for Froch is another domestic dust-up with mandatory challenger James DeGale. The IBF has ruled that Froch must face the Londoner within the nine months or be stripped of the belt.
