Grant Elliott is set to make his one-day international return on the biggest stage after being selected in New Zealand's 15-man squad for the World Cup.

The 35-year-old made the last of his 51 ODI appearances in November 2013 against Sri Lanka but is back in the fold as the Black Caps contest a World Cup on home soil for the first time in 22 years.

James Neesham misses out having struggled to make a major impact for Brendon McCullum's men in the 50-over game since his debut two years ago, averaging less than 15 in his 16 matches.

B McCullum (captain), C Anderson, T Boult, G Elliott, M Guptill, T Latham, M McClenaghan, N McCullum, K Mills, A Milne, L Ronchi (wkt), T Southee, R Taylor, D Vettori, K Williamson. 

Veteran spinner Daniel Vettori also makes the squad after ending his own 16-month ODI exile in October last year.

'There were some hard decisions to make, but we're pleased with the overall 15 we've chosen,' New Zealand coach Mike Hesson told www.blackcaps.co.nz.

'A lot of bowlers have performed brilliantly for us over the past couple of seasons, which certainly made it difficult, but we think we have the right mix.

'Our batting unit has good depth and Grant's inclusion assures us strong cover in the middle order. He brings a lot of experience and his record in New Zealand and Australia conditions is excellent.'

The Black Caps will begin their campaign against Sri Lanka on February 14 and are in Pool A alongside Australia, England, Scotland, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. 

The 35-year-old (with England's Ryan Sidebottom) hasn't played ODI cricket for New Zealand since 2013
