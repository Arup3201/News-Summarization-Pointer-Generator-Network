This is the moment a foul-mouthed rail fare cheat was on the receiving end of some rough justice, after being bundled off a train by a passenger.

Footage of the teenage troublemaker being thrown off a train by a fed-up fellow traveller on the  ScotRail service between Edinburgh and Perth has become a viral hit after being uploaded to You Tube.

It begins when a conductor is told the teenager doesn't have a ticket and tells the driver of the train to stop until the youngster gets off.

Is there a problem? After the conductor has been remonstrating with the teenager (his white beanie hat can just be seen popping over the seats), the 'big man' stands up and approaches the conductor

Time to move on son: The burly passenger looks down on the teenager and offers the conductor his assistance

When the youth refuses a shouting match ensues until a passenger, later referred to as 'the big man' leaps to his feet and frogmarches him off the train - and keeps pushing him off when he repeatedly tries to re-board the service.

A two-and-a-half minute video clip - ‘Scotrail No Ticket’ - was posted three days ago and has already been viewed almost 200,000 times.

In the clip, the white-haired ScotRail worker tells the youth: 'I’ll sit here all night pal. I’m getting paid for this but they (the passengers) will start moaning.'

The clip begins by showing the ticket inspector demanding the youngster leaves the train. He says he only has a single ticket to travel in the opposite direction. The youth responds by swearing back at him

'Fare dodging' passenger Sam Main, 19, has defended his behaviour after being tracked down by a local paper.

He told the Edinburgh Record: ‘I had been out celebrating after an exam and I was half asleep on the train.

‘I did have a ticket but I must have handed over the wrong one to the conductor. The next thing I know this big guy is manhandling me to the door and throwing me off.

University student Sam, who is studying surveying, added: ‘I couldn’t believe it when the footage turned up on YouTube.'

He said he still has cuts and bruises over his cheeks (pictured above) and legs.

The video continues with the lad 
protesting his innocence and claiming that he showed the ScotRail 
employee his ‘f*****g ticket’ while a group of stunned young children 
sit close by with their furious mother.

But the conductor adds: 'No you have not. Stop swearing.'

The video goes on to show the boy, wearing a beanie hat, produce a single ticket that allows travel in the opposite direction.

The
 conductor repeats his previous threat telling the youth: 'No you are 
off, we will sit here all night. Why should they pay and not you?'

It is at this point that a tall, heavyset passenger gets up, approaches the pair and asks ‘Is there a problem here?’ before declaring ‘No problem - right you, off’.

He then grabs the lad by the scruff of his neck and bundles him off the train, trying not to clatter into other passengers.

The teenager tries unsuccessfully a couple of times to barge his way back on before the train doors close.

As the large man heads back to his seat the carriage erupts into applause and one passenger is clearly heard saying 'Cheers, big man'.

A ScotRail spokesman said: 'While we welcome the public’s support of our zero-tolerance stance on anti-social behaviour, our staff are trained in conflict management and we do not expect members of the public to take matters into their own hands.

'We are investigating the incident, which appears to show a person travelling without a valid ticket, refusing to pay for the journey, and swearing at a staff member in full view of customers.'

Once at the train doors, the 'big man' and the ticket collector heave the youngster off the carriage

And out you go: The passenger pushes the teenager on to the platform. Each time he tries to get back in, he pushes him back out again
