A woman has been banned from keeping animals for five years after RSPCA inspectors discovered that she had almost 80 rabbits in cramped cages.

Julie Cecen, 50, was disqualified after dumping 15 rabbits in woodland near her home and keeping another 78 in cramped cages stacked on top of each other.

Cecen, from Barnet, Hertfordshire, was found guilty of six offences under the Animal Welfare Act at Willesden Magistrates Court – including three rabbits that were so malnourished they had convulsions – after her small number of pet rabbits spiralled out of control.

District Judge Brennan said in 
sentencing: ‘Miss Cecen did not set out to deliberately hurt the 
rabbits, but their numbers grew and grew and she was less and less in 
control. As a result, two rabbits died.’

The judge found that she failed to meet the needs of 78 rabbits by not providing them with a suitable environment and to meet the needs of 15 rabbits by abandoning them in the nearby woods.

Cecen also caused unnecessary suffering to three underweight and infected rabbits.

The five-year ban prevents her keeping any animals for five years. In addition, she was given a curfew order with an electronic tag and told to pay £9,000 costs.

RSPCA inspector Nicole Broster said: ‘This was a case of rabbits which had overbred with the numbers rapidly spiralling and shows how easily things can get out of control.

For keeping rabbits in conditions like this, Julie Cecen of Barnet was banned from keeping any animals for five years, subjected to a curfew and ordered to pay £9,000 costs

‘A vet who visited the property said the needs of these rabbits were clearly not being met – they simply did not have a suitable environment and did not have access to their needs.

‘Overcrowded cages were stacked on top of each other and they were not being given a proper diet or provided with enough fresh water. It was so upsetting to see.’
