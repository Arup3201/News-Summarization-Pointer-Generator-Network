Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet will target Newcastle goalkeeper Jak Alnwick in a quest for derby glory while hoping the rookie does not suffer another disaster.

The 21-year-old will line up against the Black Cats on Sunday in the biggest game of his fledgling career to date having conceded a total of eight goals in his first two senior starts for the club inside five days.

Alnwick, the Magpies' third-choice keeper, could hardly have made a better start to his spell in the limelight when he played his part in a famous 2-1  victory over Chelsea after Rob Elliot joined the already injured Tim Krul on the sidelines.

Gus Poyet plans to put Newcastle goalkeeper Jak Alnwick under a lot of pressure in the Tyne-Wear derby

Alnwick was passed fit for the game after sustaining an injury in Newcastle's 4-0 loss to Newcastle in midweek

However, his full debut at Arsenal last weekend resulted in a 4-1 defeat, and he was culpable on at least two occasions on Wednesday evening as Tottenham also scored four times, injuring a shoulder in the process to leave Pardew desperately investigating the possibility of making an emergency loan signing for the derby before the his stand-in was declared fit.

Poyet, who looked on with interest from Wearside as the drama unfolded, said: 'It's obvious that that position in particular is very special, the goalkeeper one is unique.

'Planning to do something different? No. Hitting the target? Yes. Putting the ball in the box? Yes. But that's every week, not because we are playing against this goalkeeper.

'Now, that doesn't mean that we are going to have a free-kick in our half and we are going to put it in the air and smash the goalkeeper.

'I hope it's a normal game, no accidents. I would like the game to be played normally, of course to win it and Alnwick to play 90 minutes and that there are no issues and there are no misunderstandings.

'But football, I cannot predict the future at the moment. We are going to play the game normally, I hope it's a normal game.

'Now, are we going to have a shot? Yes. Are we going to have a few crosses? I hope he is going to be under pressure. But it's more up to him than to the rest. The rest is all talking.'

Sunderland, of course, have won 3-0 on each of their last two visits to St James' Park, and that famous double came either side of a 2-1 success over the Magpies at the Stadium of Light in October last year.

That was just Poyet's second game at the helm and followed a 4-0 drubbing at Swansea in his first, so he understandably has fond memories of his derby encounters to date.

He said: 'I hope it continues. Listen, there's no better feeling. There are games when football is very nice, but special games are incredible and this is a special one, and when you are on the winning side, there is no better feeling than that.

'I only miss as a player finals and big games, derbies. The rest of the games... sometimes here on Monday nights, raining, in the north in winter, no, I don't miss those games whatsoever.

'These are the ones you want to play in, really. They're the ones in which you want to be involved because it's a great feeling when you are on the pitch, scoring and making your team win or helping your team win. That's a great feeling.'

Poyet's side currently sit in 15th place in the table having lost just four games all season, but they have won only two, a situation he is desperate to remedy this weekend.

The Uruguayan said: 'There are key moments during the season and we are looking for that. Our idea is to go and win two or three in a row, which we haven't done, and that will change the season around.

'The biggest and best game to do it is in the derby, so it would be a perfect start.'
