This is the moment six members of the crew on a cargo ship were plucked to safety as their vessel sank in the English Channel.

A mayday was sent at around 7am today as the engine room started to flood on the Sea Breeze coaster, which was 11 miles south-east of The Lizard in Cornwall.

Royal National Lifeboat Institution boats, coastguards and a search and rescue helicopter were sent to the scene and attempts were made to pump the water from the 285ft ship.

Being saved: The six-man crew were on their boat which was 11 miles south-east of The Lizard in Cornwall

A Royal Navy offshore patrol ship, HMS Tyne, was also despatched because it had bigger pumps.

But an hour after the arrival of rescuers the decision was taken to abandon the vessel which was carrying limestone.

Alex Greig, Falmouth Coastguard Watch Manager, said the crew were taken on board a lifeboat and were in good health apart from a few cuts and grazes.

He said: ‘We received the mayday broadcast from the Sea Breeze at 7am and were able to get lifeboats and the helicopter on scene quickly, along with other vessels that were in the vicinity.

Lifesavers: Coastguards said there was no chance of the Barbados-registered ship being salvaged

‘The lifeboats and helicopter pumped water off the cargo vessel, whilst HMS Tyne was on its way with commercial pumps.

‘However, unfortunately, the smaller pumps could not keep up with the ingress of water and the crew had to abandon ship at 8am. The crew are now safely ashore. A couple of them have minor injuries.’

An RNLI spokesman added: ‘We tried to help pump the vessel out. A number of other vessels also made their way to the scene to see if they could assist.

‘The pumps were not able to cope and the crew were taken off the vessel.’

Coastguards said there was no chance of the Barbados-registered ship being salvaged.
