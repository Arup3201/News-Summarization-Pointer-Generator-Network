An innovative Wendy's store in Manitoba has taken a gargantuan burger, dubbed the T-Rex, off its menu after a picture of the burger was posted on Reddit.

The burger, only available in the Brandon store, was put into production after a tongue-in-cheek ad for the non-existent burger appeared in an issue of Sports Illustrated nine years ago.

Customers began ordering the burger, which retailed for CAN$21.99, and Wendy's Brandon obliged, producing the nine-patty, nine-slices-of-cheese monstrosity.

Extinct: The T-Rex burger has been removed from the Winnipeg Wendy's which was the only Wendy's restaurant serving it

According to 10 News, an administrative assistant for Wendy's in Brandon, Barb Barker, said the store was selling two or three of the burgers each day.

But after the T-Rex began drawing attention online, head office had some misgivings and the burger was withdrawn from the menu.

'For obvious reasons, Wendy's of 
Brandon neither condones nor promotes the idea of anyone consuming a 
nine-patty hamburger in one sitting,' said Barker.

CTV reported that the burger contained 3000 calories, 200 grams of fat and 
6000 milligrams of sodium - much more than one person should consume in a
day, or even two.

The fictional burger that became a reality due to customer demand has now vanished from the menu.

Barb Barker said the fast-food restaurant 'strives to deliver a 
positive dining experience for our customers. Our goal is to provide 
options to our customers so they can make options that meet their 
needs.'

Fast food restaurants are increasingly offering healthy menu options 
including salad, fruit and low-fat versions of menu favorites, but it 
seems consumers' tastes for high-fat, high-sugar -and -salt foods is 
insatiable.

KFC introduced its Double Down Sandwich in 2010, which consisted of 
two pieces of fried chicken instead of bread, bacon and two types of 
cheese, and Dunkin' Donuts newest innovation is the Glazed Donut Breakfast Sandwich, featuring a 
donut sandwiching egg and bacon.

This latest controversy in fast-food land comes days after a Wendy's 
employee was photographed eating ice-cream straight from the soft-serve 
machine and a Florida woman filmed herself racially abusing employees at
a Dunkin' Donuts.
