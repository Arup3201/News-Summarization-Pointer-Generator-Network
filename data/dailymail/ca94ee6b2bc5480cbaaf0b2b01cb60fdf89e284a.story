Fears are growing that a serial cat killer is on the loose after more than 50 pets were reported missing in one town in the past week alone.

The cats disappeared from Ipswich, Suffolk, taking the total number of pets missing in the area in recent weeks to 160.

A Facebook page was set up for owners to report their missing pets - and the site has seen a spike when 52 cats were reported missing in just one week.

Shockingly, some cats which disappeared have been found tortured and injured after suffering horrific abuse.

'None of us have ever known anything like this before,' said Deni Parkes, from Ipswich, who set up a Facebook page for owners. Pictured, one of the pets reported missing 

Pet owners are being warned to be extra vigilant after 95 cats were reported missing in Ipswich and a further 65 in nearby Stowmarket since the start of the year.

Deni Parkes, 50, from Ipswich, who set up the Ipswich Missing Cats page, said she was 'very worried' as the number of pets disappearing continues to rocket.

She told MailOnline theories put forward by some people that take-aways are targeting the animals are unfounded and 'harmful' to the business community.

'There have been a few people who have come forward with the same story but I can't really go into that. It is a police matter.' 

Mrs Parkes, who looks after two rescue cats, Jasper and Mya, added: 'I just can't believe how many cats have gone.' 

She met police yesterday in a bid to tackle the escalating crisis and is also holding an event where cat owners can get their pets ID chipped.

The number of cats vanishing in Ipswich has rocketed in the past few days bringing the total missing to 160

'We put forward our concerns and they were very supportive. We handed over evidence that we hope will shed some light on this.

'Unfortunately, because most of the abuse is not seen it cannot be recorded as a crime.

'It's the same with missing cats - we cannot prove they are missing and name anyone.'

Mrs Parkes also called on witnesses to report any cats they see being taken.

She said: 'We are urging the public to call police there and then if they see anything rather than waiting until they get home.'

Suffolk Police spokeswoman Natalie Doughty said: 'We have met the creator of the Facebook page, Deni Parkes, but police can only investigate if there has been a criminal offence that has taken place, if a cat has been stolen or mistreated.

'We are still encouraging any cat owners to report to the RSPCA or us if their cat comes back injured so we can assess the situation.'

Cat owners have been posting details of their missing pets online. The number has risen in the past few days

Several cats were found tortured last week and speculation is rife in the community that a couple have been spotted luring cats into their car - but there's no hard evidence to back up the claims.

Louise Catchpole, 30, said her 16-week-old kittens Nigella and Rupert went missing from her home and returned with burnt whiskers and chunks of fur ripped out.

She said: 'When he (Rupert) came back he was limping, covered in faeces and absolutely terrified.

'His whiskers had been burned, there was a large chunk of fur that seemed to have been ripped out.' 

'When I took him to the vets they said it looked like he had been kicked around like a football.'

David Smith, branch co-ordinator of Cats Protection Ipswich, said: 'All we can do is give people advice with what to do with stray cats - keep the cats in out of darkness, make sure it's been neutered and make sure they are microchipped.' 

A £1,000 reward is also being offered by Cats Protection Ipswich, after a donation of £500 from a man in Scotland, for anyone with information that leads to the successful prosecution of the culprits.
