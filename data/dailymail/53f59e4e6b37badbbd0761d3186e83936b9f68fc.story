A new global monitoring system has been set up to offer ‘near real time’ information about the destruction of forests around the world.

Global Forest Watch (GFW) uses satellites, open data and crowdsourcing to give companies buying commodities and resources a better idea about whether they are unwittingly contributing to deforestation.

The system is backed by 40 businesses including Google and lets people view an interactive map that shows where forests are being destroyed around the world and how fast they are being cut down.

Global Forest Watch - a new global monitoring system - has been set up to offer 'near real time' information about the destruction of forests around the world. A map showing the last 12 years of destruction is shown

Users can access annual tree cover loss and gain data for the entire globe on a map at a resolution of 30 metres.

Deforestation data is updated in near realtime.Cloud computing, provided by Google lets people accelerate the speed at which the data can be analysed.

GFW unites high resolution information from satellites with the power of crowdsourcing.The service is free and no technical expertise is needed.

When forest loss alerts are detected, a network of partners and citizens around the world can mobilise to take action.

‘Businesses, governments and communities desperately want better information about forests. Now, they have it,’ said Dr Andrew Steer, President and CEO of WRI.

‘Global Forest Watch is a near-real time monitoring platform that will fundamentally change the way people and businesses manage forests. From now on, the bad guys cannot hide and the good guys will be recognised for their stewardship,’ he said.

The world lost 2.3 million sq km (230 million hectares) of tree cover from 2000 to 2012, according to data from the University of Maryland and Google.

That translates to 50 football pitches of forest being cut down every minute for 12 years.

Russia, Brazil, Canada, United States, and Indonesia are the countries that have lost the most tree cover.

The map shows forests of the world in high resolution of 30 metres and monthly tree cover loss data for the tropics at a resolution of 500 metres.

Users can choose to be alerted when a forest is lost, allowing networks of organisations and individuals to mobilise to take action against deforestation, GFW said.

They can also use analytical tools to select layers showing boundaries of protected areas, as well as forest fire alerts from Nasa and biodiversity hotspots.

It is hoped that GFW will have far-reaching implications across industries, enabling financial institutions to evaluate if the companies they invest in adequately assess forest-related risks.

Buyers of major commodities such as palm oil, soy, timber and beef can better monitor compliance with laws, sustainability commitments and standards and suppliers can credibly demonstrate that their products are ‘deforestation free’ and legally produced.

The tool is also designed to support indigenous communities who can upload alerts and photos when encroachment occurs on their lands and NGOs that can identify deforestation hotspots and collect evidence to hold governments and companies accountable.

Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo are excited about using the tool as it can help them design smarter policies, enforce forest laws, detect illegal forest clearing, manage forests more sustainably, and achieve conservation and climate goals. This map shows forest gain

Many governments like Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo are excited about using the tool as it can help them design smarter policies, enforce forest laws, detect illegal forest clearing, manage forests more sustainably, and achieve conservation and climate goals.

Heru Prasetyo, Government Ministerial level Head of the REDD+ Agency, Indonesia, said: ‘Indonesia is committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 26 per cent, or 41 per cent with international support, which reflect national and international commitments to combat climate change.

‘How Indonesia meets that commitment is largely defined by how we manage our forests. The ability to better monitor our forests and have up-to-date information to make decisions are critical.’
