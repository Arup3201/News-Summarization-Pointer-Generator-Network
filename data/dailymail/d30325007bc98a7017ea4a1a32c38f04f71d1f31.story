Naomi Campbell paid an undisclosed damages to Italian photographer after an alleged attack that put him in hospital

Supermodel Naomi Campbell has paid undisclosed damages to an Italian photographer after an alleged attack that put him in hospital.

The settlement was revealed as the 44-year-old went on trial for the alleged assault on Gaetano Di Giovanni, who she is accused of battering and scratching after he took pictures of her with her billionaire ex-boyfriend .

Mr Di Giovanni claimed his face was scratched and bruised after Campbell allegedly slapped him and hit him with her handbag, damaging his left eye with her nails.

The model, known for her fiery temper, denies the allegations and has claimed she was besieged by paparazzi while on holiday in the picture-perfect Aeolian islands, off the coast of Sicily.

The incident took place on the Mediterranean paradise island of Lipari in July 2009 when Miss Campbell was on holiday with her ex boyfriend Vladimir Doronin, a Russian mogul.

The pair had arrived on the island on a 120 feet yacht belonging to billionaire playboy friend Mikhail Prokhorov, after spending several days in the south of France.

After venturing onto the island for dinner the pair returned to the marina to rejoin the yacht ‘Lady in Blue’.

Pictures taken that night appear to capture the moment the local photographer attempted to snap a picture of the model.

‘She flew at him screaming gibberish’, one witness told Italian media, ‘before being dragged away by her own bodyguards.’

The fashion icon’s ‘nails had damaged his left eye’, Mr Di Giovanni told Italian newspaper La Repubblica at the time.

He said: ‘First she hit with her bag, screaming at me and then she tried to slap me.

‘I managed to avoid her – but her nails still got my eye.

‘For a few seconds I could not see a thing. I could hear that her bodyguards and her boyfriend were trying to drag her away.’

He said his eye was damaged and did not recover for three days, a claim that he said was backed up by doctors.

Mr Di Giovanni’s lawyer confirmed his 
client had settled with Campbell but declined to say how much she 
had paid. Angelo Pajno said: ‘My client has withdrawn his complaint and 
dropped the civil case, but will appear as a witness at the criminal 
trial’.

A lawyer for Campbell, Francesca Getty, said that the photographer had now withdrawn his claim.

She
 said: ‘We maintain that our client will be absolved and we hope to 
demonstrate exactly the dynamic on the island that night.’

The model was not planning to attend any of the trial hearings, she added.

An aide, who was with Campbell at the time, said: 'The incident took place in July 2009 as Naomi was entering a church to light a candle on the anniversary of Gianni Versace’s death, an intimate moment that anyone would hope be respected and kept private.

'The photographer engineered a situation where he could take advantage of Naomi to make financial gain and it reads of nothing more than extortion.'

 Under
 Italian law she is not obliged to attend court, although judges can 
look more favourably on accused that show respect to the court by taking
 part.

In 2009 the Streatham-born model admitted attacking police at Heathrow in a row over lost luggage.

She also pleaded guilty to assaulting her maid in 2007.
