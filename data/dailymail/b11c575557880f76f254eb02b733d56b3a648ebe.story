Monaco's shock Champions League victory at Arsenal on Wednesday night has been given the royal seal of approval.

Prince Albert II of Monaco, who was in situ to witness the principality club's 3-1 triumph at the Emirates Stadium, was surprised but nevertheless thrilled by the result.

'It's a historic night. Everything went wonderfully. We saw a very determined, well organised AS Monaco side,' he told the Ligue 1 club's website.

'I never thought that one day I'd see the scoreboard at the Emirates Stadium read 3-1 to AS Monaco. It's the kind of game that gives you hope for the end of the season and for the future.'

A 25-yard deflected effort from Geoffrey Kondogbia put Monaco ahead on 38 minutes, before striker Dimitar Berbatov crashed in a second on the break.

Substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain grabbed Arsenal a lifeline in stoppage-time, but Yannick Carrasco slotted Monaco's third moments later as the Gunners went in search of an equaliser.

Dimitar Berbatov enjoyed scoring Monaco's second before they eventually went on to win 3-1

Berbatov, booed throughout by sections of Arsenal supporters due to his two-year stint with their north London rivals Tottenham, felt that victory was richly deserved but that there was still work to be done in the second leg in three weeks' time to secure a place in the quarter-finals.

'We showed we're a good young team,' the Bulgarian said. 'We fought, we won our battles and we scored three goals. So I think we deserve this success against Arsenal.

'There's still one match left to play and nothing's decided yet. Arsenal are still Arsenal.'
