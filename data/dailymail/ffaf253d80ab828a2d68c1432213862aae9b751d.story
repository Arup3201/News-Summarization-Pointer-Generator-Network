Bashar Al-Assad launched the chemical attack which killed hundreds of people because he 'lost his nerve' in a moment of panic and worried that Damascus would fall to rebel troops, according to new intelligence.

In a telephone call which was tapped by German spy chiefs, a senior Hezbollah commander told the Iranian embassy in Lebanon that Syria's president intended to tilt the balance of power towards the regime in the battle for control of the country's capital.

However, it appears that the chemical attack backfired, as it looks set to prompt a major intervention from American and French troops aimed at crippling Assad's military capabilities.

Barack Obama today spoke out to demand that the world take action against Syria, saying that the international community 'cannot be silent' over the use of chemical weapons.

Attack: Bashar Al-Assad is said to have launched a barrage of chemical weapons after he 'lost his nerve'

Promise: Barack Obama said that the 'credibility' of the West was in question if it did not intervene

The German intelligence came as Vladimir Putin warned the West not to take unilateral action against Syria, and repeated his claim that the regime was not responsible for the chemical weapons strike in the suburbs of Damascus two weeks ago.

Russia today announced that it is sending a missile cruiser to the eastern Mediterranean to enforce the country's interests in the volatile region.

Pope Francis also entered the fray, attempting to slow the march to war by summoning ambassadors from all over the world.

The call from a Hezbollah leader about the chemical attack, in which he described the move as 'a big mistake', was intercepted by Germany's BNC intelligence service and reported by Der Spiegel magazine.

The revelation has led the country's top spies to agree with the U.S. intelligence assessment that Assad was indeed responsible for using chemical weapons in the attack on August 21.

BND president Gerhard Schindler said that following a 'thorough analysis', the regime must have been the perpetrator, and the government is the only actor which possesses chemical agents such as sarin.

The BND believes that the use of 
sarin may have been meant as a deterrent against rebel forces, but that 
the military used too much of it by mistake.

'The
 new information from the BND could become important in the coming 
days,' Der Spiegel said. 'Thus far the U.S. has only noted that after 
the attack, intelligence agencies had intercepted internal government 
communications indicating concern about a possible UN inspection of the 
site.

'The telephone 
conversation intercepted by the BND could be an important piece in the 
puzzle currently being assembled by Western intelligence experts.'

Despite
 the findings, Germany is unlikely to join any military action by the 
West after both Angela Merkel and her main election rival ruled out an 
attack.

Britain also 
seems certain to stay away from the front line of any conflict after 
David Cameron's Government was defeated in a vote in the House of 
Commons last week.

Strike: The West is expected to launch military attacks on Syria within the next few days

By contrast, Mr Obama is expected to win the support of the U.S. Congress after leading figures from both the Democratic and Republican parties came out in support of intervention.

Speaking in Stockholm as he travelled to the G20 summit in St Petersburg, Mr Obama insisted that it was essential to strike against Assad over the chemical attacks.

'In the face of such barbarism the international community cannot be silent,' he said at a press conference. 'Failing to respond to this attack would only increase the risk of more attacks and that possibility that other countries would use these weapons, as well.'

The President defended his decision to intervene once Assad crossed the 'red line' of using chemical weapons, saying that it was vital to uphold 'international norms'.

'That wasn't something I made up,' he said. 'I didn't pluck it out of thin air. There's a reason for it.

'The
 international community's credibility is on the line. America and 
Congress' credibility is on the line, because we give lip service to the
 notion that these international norms are important.'

He also suggested that Putin might be persuaded to change his mind on supporting Assad's government.

'I'm
 always hopeful, and I will continue to engage him,' Mr Obama said. 
'Ultimately, we can end deaths much more rapidly if Russia takes a 
different approach to these problems.'

Speaking
 alongside Swedish prime minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, he concluded: 'The 
moral thing to do is not to stand by and do nothing.'

The French parliament is today set to debate a possible military response, although the vote is considered much less important than in Britain or the U.S. because of president Francois Hollande's large majority and relative freedom of action.

'If you want a political solution you have to move the situation,' foreign minister Lauren Fabius said this morning. 'If there's no sanction, Bashar Assad will say, "That's fine, I'll continue what I'm doing."'

Adding to the tension in the eastern Mediterranean, where Israel and the U.S. test-fired a missile yesterday, Russia today ordered a missile cruiser to take over its operations in the region.

The ship, named Moskva, will be joined by a destroyer from Russia's Baltic Fleet and a frigate from the Black Sea Fleet.

'The Cruiser Moskva is heading to the Gibraltar Straits,' a military source told the state news agency. 'In approximately 10 days it will enter the east Mediterranean, where it will take over as the flagship of the naval task force.'

Russia is Assad's most powerful global ally, and has consistently opposed Western intervention in Syria's long-running civil war, calling instead for negotiations to reach a diplomatic solution.

Mr Putin suggested in an interview yesterday that Russia would support a UN resolution on military strikes if Assad is proven to have carried out the chemical attack.

However, he insisted that it would have been 'ludicrous' for the regime to draw the opposition of the international community by using banned substances such as sarin.

'From our viewpoint, it seems absolutely absurd that the armed forces, which are on the offensive today and in some areas have encircled the so-called rebels and are finishing them off, that in these conditions they would start using forbidden chemical weapons while realising quite well that it could serve as a pretext for applying sanctions against them,' he said.

'If there are data that the chemical weapons have been used, and used specifically by the regular army, this evidence should be submitted to the UN Security Council.

'And it ought to be convincing. It shouldn't be based on some rumours and information obtained by special services through some kind of eavesdropping, some conversations and things like that.'

The Russian president said he was sorry that Mr Obama had cancelled a one-on-one meeting which was due to precede the G20 summit.

'President Obama hasn't been elected by the American people in order to be pleasant to Russia,' he said. 'And your humble servant hasn't been elected by the people of Russia to be pleasant to someone either.

'We work, we argue about some issues. We are human. Sometimes one of us gets vexed. But I would like to repeat once again that global mutual interests form a good basis for finding a joint solution to our problems.'

One country which is likely to support any Western action is Turkey, one of the leading regional powers, whose prime minister said today that he would join an international coalition designed at reining in Assad.

Authorities at the Vatican, which has been outspoken about attempting to avoid war in Syria, have asked all ambassadors in the city-state to attend an audience with the Secretary of State tomorrow.

It is the first time that the whole diplomatic corps has been summoned since 2003, when John Paul II attempted to prevent the invasion of Iraq.

Vatican spokesman Padre Federico Lombardi said the Secretariat of State would put the Pope's position on Syria clearly. The summons was 'a very infrequent and significant even', he added.

Francis has already announced a day of peace for Syria on Saturday, 'the meanings and purpose' of which will be explained at the conference of ambassadors, the official Vatican newspaper the Osservatore Romano explained.

In an impassioned plea for peace during his Angelus prayer on Sunday Francis said his heart was 'deeply wounded by what is happening in Syria and anguished by the dramatic developments which are looming'.

Syria's civil war has been raging for two and a half years, since Assad started cracking down on protests inspired by the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt, and has killed more than 100,000 people.

It was revealed this week that more than 2million Syrians had been forced out of their homeland by the fighting, with the vast majority ending up in Lebanon, Turkey or Jordan.
