The scandal-hit Mid-Staffordshire NHS Trust is to be broken up after appalling care led to hundreds of deaths.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told MPs local people 'suffered too much for too long under a system which ignored appalling failures of care in their local hospital'.

He said the time had come to plans to dissolve the trust and move key services to neighbouring hospitals.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the time had come to overhaul the trust in the wake of a catalogue of failings

The trust, which has long been plagued
 by financial difficulties, was at the centre of one of the biggest 
scandals ever to hit the National Health Service.

The Francis Inquiry condemned the ‘appalling and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of people’ at the trust.

Patients
 at Stafford Hospital were left lying in their own urine and excrement 
for days, forced to drink water from vases, given the wrong medication 
or sent home with life-threatening conditions.

Mr Hunt said local people deserve to know that the NHS has learned the lessons and is guaranteeing high-quality, safe services.

He added: 'The changes recommended following this independent process, supported by local doctors, will secure the safe and high quality services that the people of Stafford deserve having endured years of uncertainty and failures in care.

'90 per cent of patient visits will continue locally, with a minority of services eventually being moved to neighbouring hospitals once the local NHS is satisfied there is sufficient capacity.

'I want Stafford to be a proper district hospital that continues to meet the needs of patients nearby, including for emergency care and births.'

He warned that without £20million in extra funding, the troubled trust would not have been able to pay staff and suppliers in 2012 and 2013.

Between 400 and 1,200 people died needlessly as a result of appalling care at Mid Staffordshire hospital

Overall control of Stafford Hospital 
will now to go to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire while 
Cannock Hospital will be run by Royal Wolverhampton Trust.

Paediatric
 assessment will still take place at Stafford Hospital by specialist 
staff, in conjunction with A&E, and critical patients will be 
allowed to stay overnight in Stafford as long as the appropriate staff 
are on duty.

The plans would
 mean the hospital would keep its current limited-hours A&E 
department. The hospital would lose in-patient paediatrics.

Philip Atkins, leader of Staffordshire County Council, said: 'The decision to dissolve Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust means it is absolutely crucial that all partners involved in the NHS now pull together and deliver what is best for the people of Staffordshire.

'While this will undoubtedly be a bitter blow for campaigners, it is also an opportunity to show how the county can now lead the way in demonstrating how integrated hospital and community care can be both delivered safely and meet the highest standards.

'The trust, as it stood, was both financially and clinically unstable, and as a county council we have always recognised the difficult challenge facing the trust special administrators, and I think they have acknowledged this too.

'There are still significant concerns over the financial fragility of the whole Staffordshire health economy and the wider impact this decision will have, especially as only last week Staffordshire was identified as one of 11 financially challenged health economies.'

But Christina McAnea, head of health for Unison, said: 'It is bitterly disappointing for the local community who have campaigned for local services and have rallied behind the hospital, as well as for staff who have worked hard to turn the trust around.'

The
 Francis report said there was an unhealthy focus on money and 
Government targets that means the NHS does not put its patients first.

Campaigners from Cure NHS demanded change after patients ere left lying in their own urine and excrement for days, forced to drink water from vases, given the wrong medication or sent home with life-threatening conditions

It called for a 'zero tolerance' approach to poor standards after 'appalling' failings caused by 'a lack of care, compassion, humanity and leadership'.with some patients left lying in their own faeces for days, forced to drink water from vases or given the wrong medication.

That followed a 2009 investigation by the Healthcare Commission which found between 400 and 1,200 more people died at Stafford Hospital than would have been expected.

In December, trust special administrators said the overall trust was ‘unsustainable’ and that without changes Mid Staffordshire would face annual debts of more than £40 million by 2017.
