A teenage entrepreneur who scooped a £80,000 investment on Dragon's Den has been arrested on suspicion of burgling his mother's house.

Jordan Daykin, 19, became the youngest person to ever go into business with the Dragons when Deborah Meaden pledged the money in return for a 25 per cent stake in his  business.

But just two months later he was arrested after his mother claimed he ransacked her house and stole a number of valuables including, Swarovski crystals, four televisions and jewellery worth £4,000.

Claims: Jordan Daykin, pictured right on Dragons' Den earlier this year, is alleged to have stolen from the home of his mother Maria Daykin, right, in Westbury, Kent. He was arrested and later released on bail

Permission: Jordan's spokesman said that he was allowed to enter the home and that his mother had recently experienced 'a sudden upheaval at home'. Above, one of the rooms that Ms Daykin claimed was burgled

A spokesman for Jordan said that he had permission from his mother to enter the house and that he was simply helping his brother leave home after a row. He added that the belongings they took belonged to them.

Mother-of-two Maria Daykin, 45, said she was 'disgusted' by her son's alleged actions, which are said to be part of a family feud.

She said: 'I had to phone the police because it is a violation of my privacy. When I got home I found my house had just been completely trashed, every bit of furniture, the TVs off the wall, everything.

'He has been nominated for all these awards. I think the only motive was for me to walk in and see my house destroyed.' 

She claims to have lost all the furniture from two bedrooms, around 100 DVDs and perfume worth nearly £300.  

'Family feud': The teenager's spokesman said Jordan was was simply helping his brother leave the home in Westbury, Wiltshire, pictured, after a row. He claims that they removed some of their possessions

'Disgusted': Ms Daykin claims Jordan and three others planned the raid for when she was out the house. Above, the mess Ms Daykin said was left in her garage (left) after the alleged burglary, and an empty bedroom

'Violation': Ms Daykin said that she returned home to find that her house, pictured, had been ransacked and claims that items including two beds, four televisions and jewellery worth £4,000 had been stolen.

Ms Daykin, from Westbury, Wiltshire, said the incident happened on October 9 and that her son was swiftly arrested later that evening by Wiltshire Police.

She claims Jordan and three others planned the raid for when she was out the house. 

He was arrested and kept overnight and was released on bail after extensive questioning.

Record-breaking: Jordan Daykin became the youngest entrepreneur to secure an investment on Dragons' Den when Deborah Meaden, pictured, pledged £80,000 for a share in his company

The teenager's spokesman said Jordan was simply helping his brother leave home after a row.

He said: 'Some of his brother's possessions were removed and some of Jordan's.'

He said that his mother had given her permission and added: 'She's had a sudden upheaval at home. Jordan's sensitive to her emotional state.'

Last week Jordan was short-listed as Young Entrepreneur of the Year in the GB Entrepreneur Awards.

In August he was handed £80,000 from Dragon Deborah Meaden after she took an interest in his company Grip It Fixings, which offers a universal fixing, designed for use with all types of plasterboard.

The investment will help Jordan with the costs of new machinery, stock increase and a deposit for their warehouse in Melksham, Somerset.

Jordan left school at the age of 13 and his first business was a website called RS2Services, inspired by his love of RuneScape, an online fantasy role-playing game.

The site offered players the best RuneScape products at a cheaper price.

He later founded nationwide tutoring agency Tutor Magnet, which currently has a database of over 400 tutors and generates a turnover of £2,000 a month.

Jordan came up with the idea for Grip It Fixings in 2008 while putting up curtain rails with his then 74-year-old grandfather Stan. 

A Spokesman for Wiltshire Police said: 'We can confirm a man aged 19 was arrested on October 9 at approximately 7pm on suspicion of burglary and was taken to Melksham Police Station.

'He has been bailed pending further enquiries.'
