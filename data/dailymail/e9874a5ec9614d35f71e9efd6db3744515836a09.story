Bill Cosby's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame has been defaced with the word 'rapist'  after mounting allegations of sexual assault.

On Thursday night, the word was scrawled three times on the star on the storied Walk of Fame - the stretch of celebrity themed sidewalk visited by millions of tourists every year.

'When people are unhappy with one of our honorees, we would hope that they would project their anger in more positive ways than to vandalize a California State landmark,' the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce said in a statement. 'The star is being cleaned up at this time.'

Photographs taken on Friday showed workers scrubbing the stone.

The incident comes after 20 women, including former super model Janice Dickinson, stepped forward to accuse the comedian of unwanted advances, including drugging and then raping them.

In 2005, a Temple University employee accused him of an assault and - although 13 women who claimed they had similar experience were willing to testify in the case - it was settled out of court.

Then two months ago, after comedian Hannibal Buress went on a rant about the comedian during a stand-up set, scores of women started coming forward to accuse Cosby of rape.

He has most recently been taken to court by a woman, Judy Huth, who claims she was just 15 when Cosby raped her at the Playboy Mansion in 1974.

Cosby's lawyers have said she previously tried to extort him and have requested that the case is thrown out, saying the accusations are too old.

Accused: Cosby, 77, has been accused of rape or sexual assaults by at least 20 women since October. Many of the alleged attacks took place decades ago when the women were aspiring actresses

As the allegations surfaced, NBC dropped a new project with the comedian, while Netflix also shelved a one-off comedy special planned for the day after Thanksgiving.

He also resigned from Temple University's board of trustees, which he joined in 1982.

And on Thursday, the Navy announced it is revoking the former sailor's title of honorary chief petty officer, saying the allegations against him are serious and conflict with the Navy's core values.  

The 77-year-old Cosby has refused to answer questions about mounting accusations that he sexually abused several women.
