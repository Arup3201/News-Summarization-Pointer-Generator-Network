A drunken row over the attractiveness of X Factor runner-up Rebecca Ferguson (pictured) led to a man having boiling water poured over him and part of his ear bitten off

Two men who burned and mutilated a 
semi-conscious man after they reportedly argued over last year’s X 
Factor final were jailed today.

Lee Stynes, 28, and Mathew 
Gannaway-Pitts, 18, subjected Brian Wade to a vicious attack in which 
part of one of his ears was severed and his face scalded with boiling 
water from a kettle.

The kettle was then used to bludgeon him, hours after the three had 
watched an episode of the reality talent contest.

It has been reported the men, who
had been drinking heavily, earlier argued over finalist Rebecca 
Ferguson, who came second to winner Matt Cardle during the 2010 final, 
discussing whether she would win and whether she was likely to sleep 
with any of the three of them.

The court heard Wade, aged in his
40s, was left with a disfigured ear and skin pigmentation on his head 
after the attack, which had also left him in fear of Stynes and worsened
his epilepsy.

Paranoid schizophrenic Stynes, who had
a past history of violence, was jailed indefinitely for public 
protection at Exeter Crown Court today.

The court heard that he 
jumped on Mr Wade, who was almost unconscious, and shouted to 
Garraway-Pitts: 'Watch this, I’m going to bite the b*****d’s ear off.'

The court heard he had 42 
previous convictions, including two for threatening to bite people’s 
noses off and one for throwing boiling water at someone.

Judge Erik Salomonsen told the men: 'Your victim was falling asleep, his speech was slurred and you set upon him. Regardless of who started it, you have been involved in a horrific attack.'

Stynes, of no fixed abode, pleaded 
guilty to GBH with intent on October 10, with police saying after the 
court appearance that they had argued over the X Factor.

He will serve a
minimum of three years and four-and-a-half months but will only be 
released when he is deemed not to be a danger to the public.

As he was led away, he said 'Cheers, guv' to the judge.

Gannaway-Pitts, also of no fixed 
abode, who was 17 at the time of the attack on December 18 last year, 
admitted GBH at the earlier hearing and was sentenced to 16 months. The 
court heard he 'hero-worshipped' the older man and had started the 
beating before Stynes joined in.

The court heard that the two 
defendants were frequent visitors to Mr Wade’s flat in Exeter, the 
location of the attack, where they went to drink and take drugs.

On the night of December 17 last year 
the three of them, along with Mr Stynes’ girlfriend and another man had 
been drinking in the flat which was such a mess because of Wade’s 
'hoarding' that he slept in the lounge.

Prosecutor Terry Holder said that they
had at some point watched an episode of X Factor which they previously 
recorded, before carrying on drinking.

Stynes, his girlfriend and 
Gannaway-Pitt then left to go to the home of the younger man’s father, 
but returned after failing to get in.

'The matter seems to have been started by Gannaway-Pitt showing off,' Mr Holder said.

'He started punching Mr Wade, who was by then rather zombie-like.'

Stynes joined in, before running into 
the kitchen to get the kettle of boiling water, which he said, falsely, 
also contained sugar - which burns badly when it contacts with skin.

He 
came in and poured it over his 'defenceless' victim, saying 'take that 
you bastard'.

Gannaway-Pitt then picked up the 
kettle and beat Mr Wade so severely he smashed the kettle. It was then 
that Stynes bit off part of Mr Wade’s ear.

The court heard that the 
younger man stole the piece of ear and later showed it to his 
girlfriend, boasting that he had bitten it off himself.

Mark Jackson, defending Stynes, said 
his client had not premeditated the attack but said he was previously 
told that Wade had committed a sexual assault on his girlfriend.

He said his client had been abused as a
child and 'continued to hear voices', turning to drink and drugs to 
cope with an illness that left him quick to anger.

Stynes once attempted
to get himself admitted to a psychiatric unit and set himself on fire 
when he was refused, Mr Jackson said.

'At 28 he is a relatively young man. He has had an awful life so far,' he said.

'He has done what he can to get help from authorities. He will take it as and when it is offered.'

Gannaway-Pitts was ordered to serve 16
months but because he had served almost a year on remand he was 
released immediately on licence.
