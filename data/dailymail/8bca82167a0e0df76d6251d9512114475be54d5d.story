Ukip have increased the pressure on George Osborne to ease the tax burden on millions of middle-class Britons

Ukip will today  pile pressure on George Osborne to ease the tax burden on millions who have been sucked into the higher 40p rate of income tax.

The Eurosceptic party is proposing a new 35p rate to be levied on earnings between £42,000 and £55,000, arguing many middle-class families on such incomes are being unfairly squeezed.

It will also float the idea of a ‘turnover tax’ – a minimum percentage of companies’ annual turnover that has to be paid to the Treasury – to crack down on large-scale tax avoidance.

Ukip says the £2.5 billion a year cost of a new 35p income tax rate should also be met by cutting the foreign aid budget, ending contributions to Brussels by exiting the EU, slashing funding to Scotland and scrapping the new high speed rail line HS2.

It will also back a Liberal Democrat policy to increase the starting rate for income tax further to £12,500, bringing it broadly in line with the minimum wage.

Chancellor George Osborne has targeted support at more than 20 million basic rate taxpayers, despite calls from the Tory Right for him to do more for middle class families who have been dragged into the 40p rate.

A dramatic and expensive increase in the personal allowance from £6,475 to £10,500 means that since 2010 almost three million people have been lifted out of paying income tax.

For the average taxpayer, it will amount to paying over £700 a year less in income tax compared to when the Coalition took power. The Treasury says anyone earning up to around £120,000 has seen at least some overall benefit from the higher starting rate of tax.

However, the numbers dragged into paying the higher 40p income tax is expected to rise from three million in 2010 to 4.9million by the time of next year’s election.

In 1978, only three per cent of taxpayers paid tax at the higher rate. By next year it will be approaching 20 per cent.

Normally, the 40 per cent higher-tax threshold rises in line with inflation to take into account rises in the cost of living. But from April 2014, the point at which higher rate tax is paid is to rise by a flat 1 per cent for two years instead. This lower rise in the threshold means more workers will be caught in the 40 per cent net.

Nigel Farage's party will announce it wants to cut income tax for middle-earning families at its conference

Ukip economics spokesman Patrick O’Flynn, who will propose a new 35p rate at his party’s annual conference today said: ‘This is a massive blind spot for the coalition, and for George Osborne in particular. He has given the very highest earners a tax cut, and we agree that 50p was too high as a top rate.

‘But he seems to think that tax discincentives only really apply to the very wealthiest. It’s incredible that a Tory Chancellor after half a decade in office is going to go into an election with a 40p threshold that’s actually lower than the one he inherited from a Labour Chancellor.

Those on these incomes are aspirational people, many of whom started with very little. They are by no means rich. Traditionally they might have thought the Tory party would back them, certainly in the days of Thatcher.

‘Yet they have seen Osborne penalise them.’

Official figures, from HM Revenue and Customs, show there were just three million higher rate taxpayers when the coalition came to power in May 2010.

An analysis by the Taxpayers’ Alliance shows the starting salary for higher rate tax would currently be £63,777 if it had been uprated each year in line with earnings.

Conservative MP Dominic Raab has led calls for the Treasury to act to help those on the higher rate. He said the Government needed to ‘ease the squeeze on the middle classes’.

Mr O’Flynn said Ukip would also ask the Treasury to examine the feasibility of a ‘turnover tax’ to reduce large scale tax avoidance, and at what level it might be set. ‘It would act as a backstop for the tax system, so that every major company would be measured on whether it had paid a set proportion of turnover in corporation or other taxes,’ he said.
