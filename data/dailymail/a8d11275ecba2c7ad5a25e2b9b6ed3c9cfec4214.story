A teacher who has recently transitioned from being a man to a woman has shared the highs and lows of stepping into her new identity.

Karen Adell Scot, 56, from Oakhurst, California, announced in March that she would be returning to her post at Yosemite High School not as Mr Gary Sconce, as she was formally known, but Miss Scot; having had gender reassignment surgery.

Writing for Today, Miss Scot relayed the reaction she had from one of her female students, who told her: 'You know, I really liked Mr Sconce. He was a lot of fun. But you’re such a better teacher than Mr Sconce. Because you listen to us.'

Sadly for Miss Scot, her own family have been less accepting of her transition.

Her former wife divorced her last September after 36 years of marriage because she didn't want to be married to a woman. Miss Sconce's son is 'trying to re-establish' a relationship, but only communicates intermittently.

Her daughter warned her that if she had surgery to feminize her face, she'd be 'dead to her' - and followed up on her promise after Miss Scot underwent the surgery.

'I don't get many reciprocal texts or communications from her. And I don’t get to see her daughter, my granddaughter,' Miss Scot reports. 'My daughter was always a daddy’s girl.

'She always hung around with this hardheaded, conservative, military, law enforcement, masculine type of guy. That’s who I was. On the outside.'

Indeed, before Miss Scot started taking estrogen - a naturally occurring female hormone taken by men who are in transition - she describes herself as having been 'hyper' and 'uneasy.'

Speaking to The Sierra Star earlier this year, Miss Scot said she had tried a variety of activities to convince herself of her masculinity; including college football, joining the military, becoming a sheriff's deputy, and teaching martial arts.

She writes for Today: 'Imagine that you are swimming in the ocean and you get rolled by a huge wave. You don’t know which way is up.

'You're drowning. You’re suffocating. That’s what life felt like before my transition. 

'Like struggling to survive under a tidal wave.'

Transformed: Miss Scot posted these photos to her Facebook account, writing, 'That "man" [right] started the school year last year. Look at the sadness in "his" eyes. Notice the profound diffference! [left]'

After Miss Scot finally summoned the courage to come clean about how she felt - that she'd been trapped in the wrong body for as long as she can remember - she hoped her wife would be able to get past it.

Tragically, despite her former wife's best efforts, she found herself unable to and filed for divorce in September. 

Worse, Miss Scot found that after her transition, she realized she appreciated her ex-wife and loved her 'far more deeply' than she had when she was a man.

She does, however, insist she 'understands' the undoubtedly difficult decision made by her ex-wife, and hopes they can still be friends.

Say cheese: Miss Scot, pictured last month, claims that her sex change has left feeling 'alive for the first time' and overwhelmed with 'pure happiness and joy'

While many former friends, acquaintances and colleagues have shunned Miss Scot's new identity, she focuses on the 'vast majority' of her students who have responded positively. 

'As a woman in the classroom, I possess tremendous empathy and insight that I didn’t have as a man,' she writes. 'Now, I am calm, happy, easygoing and organized.'

Miss Scot claims that her sex change has left feeling 'alive for the first time' and overwhelmed with 'pure happiness and joy.'

She regularly writes to her estranged daughter to tell her how much she loves and cares for her. For now, it's all she can do.

'I will keep trying,' Miss Scot concludes.
