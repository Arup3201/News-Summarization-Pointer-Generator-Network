DVD copies of Team America: World Police have sold out on Amazon and Walmart following the controversy surrounding fellow North Korean parody The Interview.

The 2004 comedy, by South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, uses a cast of puppets to poke fun at former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and a host of Hollywood celebrities.

The movie has now become a hit again - following Sony's cancelled and reinstated release of The Interview, a film based on an assassination plot of current North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.

Rekindled interest: DVD copies of Team America: World Police have sold out on Amazon and Walmart following the controversy surrounding fellow North Korean parody The Interview

The movie's plot led to hackers targeting Sony Pictures Entertainment last month - breaching their computer systems and putting thousands of confidential and embarrassing emails into the public domain.

The film drew immediate comparisons to Team America for being one of only a few films that mocked a living dictator.

After Sony scrapped the release of The Interview, a number of smaller chains and independent movie theaters decided they would screen Team America around Christmas instead, reports Mashable UK.

But Paramount has now weighed in -  banning theaters from following through with the plans, without releasing a statement explaining their actions.

One of the theaters, the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, said last week: 'Due to to circumstances beyond our control, the TEAM AMERICA 12/27 screening has been cancelled. We apologize & will provide refunds today.' 

In Team America: World Police, Kim Jong-il is impaled on a spike and then revealed to be an alien.

The film earned $12million in its opening U.S. weekend - eventually grossing more than $52million in the box office.

Since The Interview hit headlines, DVDs of the movie have sold out on Amazon, Best Buy and Walmart. 

And in a change of fortune, 300 independent US theaters have now confirmed they will in fact screen beleaguered Seth Rogen and James Franco film The Interview this week.

North Korea called 'The Interview' and 'act of war' for portraying the assassination and violent death of its current leader, Kim Jong-un - who took over after his father's death

Despite announcing they would not distribute the controversial movie in the aftermath of a terrorist threat from hacking organization Guardians of Peace, Sony announced yesterday that the film will play in selected theaters and on video on-demand from Christmas Day.

The major cinemas - who feared running the comedy would make them terror targets - still refuse to play The Interview, chopping down Sony's original release schedule from around 3,000 screens across the country to just over 300.

The studio released a statement yesterday confirming the news, with both Rogen and Franco sharing their joy at the update and even President Obama applauding the move as artistic freedom.

Obama had previously claimed he was disappointed with Sony for canceling The Interview during a press conference and went on to flub Franco's name.

Excitement: Seth Rogen shared how happy he was on Twitter Tuesday afternoon

Alamo Drafthouse planned to make a stand against North Korea by showing Team America: World Police instead of The Interview - but was forced to pull the plug

'"The Interview" starring Seth Rogen and James Flacco saved by President Obacco! I MEAN PRESIDENT OBAMA!!!!! Sorry!!!' wrote Franco on his Instagram.

Obama had called the actor James Flacco, while calling Sony's decision to not release the film a 'mistake.'

It would seem that he had confused the Hollywood heartthrob with Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco.

Flacco found the entire incident hysterical, writing soon after on Twitter; 'Welcome to the family, brother. @JamesFrancoTV.'
