A Kansas woman was reunited with her class ring after losing it more than 20 years ago thanks to the help of a group of high school students.

Rachel Robinson found a 1957 Colorado high school class ring in a playground when she was just a young girl, she told KDVR. Thinking it was a 'queen's ring', the young Robinson tucked the ring away in a special box.

That was more than two decades ago.

L.C.: The students searched for the owner of the ring under the initials L.C., as Flesher's maiden name was Crosslen

Robinson rediscovered the ring Jan. 12 in, what she called, her 'baby box,' according to KMBC. 

Now understanding the importance of a class ring, Robinson contacted the school, Lewis-Palmer High School in Colorado, and the search for the owner of the 1957 class ring began.

A teacher at the high school, Tana Lucido, enlisted the help of her internet-savvy high school students to search for the ring's owner -- whose initials were 'L.C.,' according to KDVR.

'They found her in the yearbook and then they found her parents in the obituaries,' Robinson said.

'They found her married last name from that and then found her through Facebook.'

KDVR reports that the group of teens used the internet, yearbooks, the yellow pages, and even census records to track down Linda Crosslen -- now Linda Flesher. 

'A few months ago, one of my grandsons had gotten his class ring and I was going to get mine out to compare with his,' Flesher told KMBC.

25 Years: Flesher (left), who has since moved from Colorado to Kansas City, said she is glad to have the ring back after 25 years, although she doesn't know how it ended up in the Kansas playground

Flesher, who has since moved from Colorado to Kansas City, said she is glad to have the ring back after 25 years, although she doesn't know how it ended up in the Kansas playground.

She said the return of the ring is like revisiting the past.

'It's kind of like we go back in time to the high school crushes and the fun of going to the games, Flesher said.

Robinson told KMBC that she thought she'd be returning the ring to a a child or grandchild of Flesher, but to get to return it to the actual owner 'is great.'
