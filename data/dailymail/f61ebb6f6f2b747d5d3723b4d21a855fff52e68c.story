Brazil superstar Neymar has responded to Gary Medel's accusation of 'theatrics' by saying he does not know who the Chile midfielder is.

The pair were involved in Sunday's feisty international friendly at the Emirates where Medel was fortunate not to be sent off for what appeared to be a nasty stamp on the Brazilian.

After the game, which Brazil won 1-0 through Roberto Firmino's late goal, Neymar commented that he did not consider the way Medel and the Chile players approached the game to be football.

The Brazilian was left writhing in agony, although Medel accused him  of 'theatrics' after the game 

Medel responded by posting a Twitter picture of  the 23-year-old forward appearing to catch him with a tackle accompanied by the caption: 'Some engage in theatrics while others keep playing.'

The Barcelona forward reignited the argument on his return to the Nou Camp, telling Mediaset: 'I don't know Medel, I don't know who he is. If he says that it is theatre, from there I will say nothing else. Only that it was a tough match.' 

Meanwhile, Neymar has picked up the Samba Gold Award, which recognises him as the best Brazilian player plying his trade in Europe.

The Barca striker received 19 votes to beat Miranda and Felipe Melo who each collected 16 votes.
