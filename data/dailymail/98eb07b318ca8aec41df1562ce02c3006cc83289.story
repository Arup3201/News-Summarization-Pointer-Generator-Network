Police have called off the search for two students eight days after they disappeared from the college in Maine where they were learning to build boats.

Rescuers say they have searched every inch of the waters off Cape Porpoise in Kennebunkport and have found only a set of clothes that may have belonged to one of the friends.

Zachary Wells, 21, and Prescott Wright, 
23, were last seen drinking beer a home in the seaside community on December 19.

A Maine Marine Patrol plane circled 
the cape at low tide on Wednesday and searchers were able to see the 
bottom of the bay in most areas, the Portland Press Herald reports.

In the few places the bottom could not be seen, two boats equipped with sonar were dispatched.

One of the boats revealed two blips on the sonar and divers were sent down to the area - but did not find anything.

'We were able to determine that the 
likelihood of them being in the harbor has been exhausted,' 
Kennebunkport Deputy Police Chief Kurt Moses told the Press Herald.

Police have no other leads as to where the men might be and a winter storm is threatening to make continued search danger, Moses said.

The disappearance of the two friends baffled authorities, who have searched by air, water and in wooded areas for the men.

Wells and Wright are students at The Landing School in Arundel, Maine., where they were learning boat building and yacht design.

When the men failed to show up for classes on Thursday and Friday, administrators at the school contacted police.

Authorities found no signs of a 
disturbance at the home, Sanford said, and searches of the nearby area 
did not turn up any clues.Â 

Only one of the men owns a vehicle, and it remained parked in the driveway of the house.

'There's no one area to pinpoint 
because we don't know where they might have gone,' said Sanford, calling
it one of the strangest cases he has ever seen.

Both men were expected to head to their home states for the holidays

Wells, and Prescott Wright, were last seen drinking beer at Wells' home
in Kennebunkport, Maine around midnight on Wednesday.

But when one of Wells' roommates went downstairs to turn off a radio at 4am, neither man was there.

When they did not turn up for classes at The
Landing School - where they were learning boat building and yacht 
design - in Arundel on Thursday and Friday, administrators called the 
police.

Nothing indicates foul play, Police Chief Craig Sanford said, and searches of ocean waters, roadsides and marshy areas have failed to turn up any clues on their whereabouts.

'There's no one area to pinpoint because we don't know where they might have gone,' he said, adding that the disappearance is one of the strangest cases he's seen.

Authorities found no signs of a 
disturbance at the home. One of the men owns a vehicle but it 
remained parked in the driveway of the house. Witnesses said the men appeared drunk.

Robert DeColfmacker, president of the Landing School, told the Portland Press Herald that Wells' roommates said the two men had left their cellphones and wallets at the home.

'These are two students without a history of disappearing or unexplained absences,' he said.

On Sunday, a 
Warden Service airplane searched from the air and the Maine Marine 
Patrol and members of Well's and Wright's families searched on the 
ground, Sanford said.

Sanford said authorities do not know when or 
how Prescott and Wells left the home but assume they left together.

'We have no idea how they left, or why,' he said. 'The whole thing is perplexing to us.'

He added that they had searched the nearby water due to its proximity to the home and had no 'hard facts' that suggested had actually gone there.

The friends were supposed to be 
returning to their home states for the holidays. Wells is from 
Burlington, Vermont, while Wright comes from Barnstable, Massachusetts.

Wright's
family have not commented on the disappearance, but Wells' father, Jim 
Wells, told the Press Herald that everyone he has met in Maine has been 
helpful.

'I have nothing to add other than to say [Zachary] is a great kid,' he said.

Wells is white, 5ft 8, around 150 pounds with black 
hair, hazel eyes and a surgical scar on his neck.

Wright is white, 6ft 4, around 200 pounds with brown hair and blue eyes.

Anyone with information is asked to call the Kennebunkport Police Department at 207-967-2454.
