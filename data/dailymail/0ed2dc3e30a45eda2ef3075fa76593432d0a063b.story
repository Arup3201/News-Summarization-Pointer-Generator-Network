Police Lieut-General Panya Mamen said all suspects had been questioned and two had been singled out.

'We are now confident we have the evidence about who are the murderers,' he said.

Police investigating the murders of Britons Hannah Witheridge and David Miller said today they are close to arresting 'more than one' suspect

The police general added: 'I am confident they will be arrested and charged this week.'

He spoke as the owner of one bar attended a police 'war room', set up in a medical centre, to tell police what he knows and was then allowed to leave.

He was followed shortly afterwards by one of two men who had been identified by Briton Sean McAnna as the person who had suggested he hang himself the night before.

The local man said Mr McAnna had no reason to run away, pointing out that his own companion that night had been an undercover police officer. 

Mr McAnna yesterday fled the island of Koh Tao in fear of his life as he claimed two men he suspected wanted to find a scapegoat for the two UK tourists killed there last week wanted him dead too. 

It was also reported yesterday that Thai police were to force every man on the island to take a DNA test.

Picturesque: Police have come under fire for their handling of the case which critics say has descended into chaos

Miss Witheridge, 23, and Mr Miller, 24, were found bludgeoned to death with a garden hoe on the beach on September 15.

Police had said their prime suspect was a fisherman who had already fled the island on a private boat.

But yesterday they said they wanted to swab every man across the island including fishermen and boat drivers who may have visited the area at the time of the killings, the BBC reported.

Initial tests show DNA samples found on the bodies almost certainly came from two Asian men, though detectives said yesterday that they now believe at least three people were involved in the attack.

Thai police said they 'still believe sexual jealousy is at the heart of this crime'.

Colonel Kissana Phathanachareon cited 'fresh evidence which could lead to a new suspect who may have had a relationship or one-night stand with Hannah or one of her friends or David'.

The Bangkok Post last night reported police had narrowed their inquiry to two suspects – a Thai national and a Burmese worker.

Police have come under fire for their handling of the case which critics say has descended into chaos. Local media in particular have turned on their force, claiming its incompetence stretches way beyond this investigation.

The Thai capital's top-selling English-language newspaper, The Bangkok Post, wrote in an editorial yesterday: 'The handling of the investigation into the murders of British tourists Hannah Witheridge and David Miller on Koh Tao is an international scandal and should be a source of deep embarrassment.

'And it would be, except the egregious lack of professionalism displayed in this case is par for the course for the Thai police force.'

Nevertheless, the commander in charge of the police force sought yesterday to reassure the public that everything was under control.' 

Briton Sean McAnna yesterday fled the island of Koh Tao  as he claimed two men he suspected wanted to find a scapegoat for the murders last week wanted him dead too.

Mr McAnna, 25, from Shott, Scotland, hurried to the island ferry after making a desperate phone call for help in the dead of night from an all-night supermarket, where he had been hiding behind the counter from his pursuers.

He had put out a desperate message on Facebook as he hid from the two men, declaring: ‘Thai Mafia are trying to kill me. Please help me.’

‘I genuinely thought this was the day I was going to die,' he said an hour after his ordeal as he reflected on the murders of Britons Miss Witheridge and Mr Miller bludgeoned to death on a beach on the island a week ago.

Mr McAnna, who had met Mr Miller a few times on the island on social occasions, thought back to the moment when two men who had chased him suggested he kill himself so he could be accused of taking his life because he was the person who had murdered Miss Witheridge and Mr Miller.

'I'd gone to a bar and a guy started asking me questions because he knew the guy who died and he had heard my name. I was a bit drunk and I started answering them about general things and the murders came up.

'They just said to me "It was you who killed them...you've got two people's deaths on your hands...we know it was you. You're going to hang yourself tonight and we're going to watch you hang. You will die tonight. If you don’t hang yourself, we will do it for you. You already have two people’s deaths on your hands.”

'So I just ran. I just left and ran. They wouldn’t have shot me - they would have taken me up into the hills to hang me and make it look like it was suicide.

'They chased me into a shop and I ran behind the counter. I went on my Facebook on my phone and took pictures of the guys and uploaded them straight to Facebook to say that if anything happens to me everybody knows who did it.'

Mr McAnna, who phoned his girlfriend Francesca, 22, in Italy to tell her that he was safe after his ordeal, said he believed the men needed a scapegoat because ‘I think they might know who it was.’

They needed someone to pin the murders on, he said, because they didn’t want the killers to be locals.

‘They want it to be a Westerner, so if I kill myself here, if I hang myself here, then it’s easy to say “See, it was him.”’
