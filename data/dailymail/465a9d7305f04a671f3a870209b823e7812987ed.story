Neville, who played alongside Beckham for Manchester United and England, believes his former team-mate could become a success in any field.

Speaking at the Soccerex Global Convention in Manchester, Neville said: 'I think he could achieve anything he wants to achieve.

'You could see him going up to government level or to head the FA or to do something in America that is not just average - he doesn't do anything that is average.

'He wants to do something that is going to leave a legacy, a stamp.

David Beckham has already worked for the FA in an ambassadorial role but could take more responsibility

'I heard him talk this week about being involved in the FA.

'It would be silly of the FA not to take up that kind of offer, because what an unbelievable ambassador he is.'

Beckham, 39, had an off-field role with England as 'player liaison' at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, which he could not feature in due to injury.

Beckham earned 115 England caps during his illustrious career and played for United, Real Madrid, the Los Angeles Galaxy, AC Milan and Paris St Germain before retiring last year.
