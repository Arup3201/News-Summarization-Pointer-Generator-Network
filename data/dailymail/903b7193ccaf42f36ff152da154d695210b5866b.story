Palmer United Party member Jacqui Lambie has declared she will take a DNA test in order to prove her Indigenous Australia heritage to naysayers.

During her first speech to parliament the outspoken senator claimed she was a descendant of a prominent Aboriginal leader in Tasmania, where she is originally from.

However Tasmanian Aboriginal Land Council (TALC) chairman Clyde Mansell has called her claim 'absolutely outrageous and scandalous', the ABC reported.

Outspoken senator Jacqui Lambie has said she will take a DNA test in order to prove her Indigenous heritage

Mr Mansell is a community elder and known descendant of Mannalargenna. 

This was no deterrent for Senator Lambie, who told reporters in Hobart on Monday: 'I know what's in my blood'.

Tasmanian Aboriginal Land Council chairman Clyde Mansell has disputed that Senator Lambie has Aboriginal heritage

'If Mansell wants to take me on, I guess I'll meet him up at the hospital and both have a DNA test and see how we go once and for all,' she said.

In the maiden speech, Senator Lambie acknowledged Australia's traditional Aboriginal owners and revealed she had Aboriginal blood on her mother's side of the family.

She said: 'We trace our history over six generations to celebrated Aboriginal chieftain of the Tasmania east coast, Mannalargenna.'

However Mr Mansell hit back at the outspoken senator and said she had 'no right' to make the 'ridiculous' assertion, and said she pronounced Mannalargenna incorrectly, according to the ABC.

He also said DNA tests are not necessarily conclusive in proving one has Indigenous heritage, and dismissed her claims as completely false.

Last week Senator Lambie called for an Indigenous quota in parliament to reflect Australian society, saying they needed a bigger representation in the decision making of the country.

She cited Maori seats in New Zealand's parliament as evidence the policy would work. 

Indigenous Affairs Minister Nigel Scullion is not ruling out dedicated indigenous seats in federal parliament and said he is prepared to discuss the issue with Senator Lambie.

However he pointed out that it was more important to have the discussion with Indigenous Australians rather than with politicians.

'My opinion means very little. My important responsibility is to reflect the opinions and feelings of my mob,' he told reporters in northeast Arnhem Land on Monday.
