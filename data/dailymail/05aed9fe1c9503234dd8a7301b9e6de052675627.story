Children who recognise the logos of fast food chains such as McDonald's (pictured) are more likely to be fat, a new study claims

The glowing neon signs of McDonald's, KFC and other fast food chains can be seen in almost every city across the globe.

And now researchers have found that children as young as three who recognise the logos of the restaurants, are more likely to be fat.

A new study revealed that children who could also recall the brand names of soft drinks and unhealthy snack brands are more likely to be overweight or obese.

Previous research has shown that children who are overweight tend to maintain an unhealthy weight throughout their lives.

A team from Michigan State University in the U.S. tested children on their knowledge of various brands - including their ability to identify brand logos such as the McDonald’s golden arches.

They found that those who could identify them most easily tended to have higher body mass indexes, or BMIs.

‘We found the relationship between brand knowledge and BMI to be quite robust.

'Kids who know most about these brands have higher BMIs,’ said study co-author Anna McAlister, a professor of advertising and public relations.

Children between the ages of three and five were given pictures of unhealthy food-related logos.

They were then handed images of food items, packaging and cartoon characters and asked to match the items with their corresponding brand logos, according to the study which was published in the journal Appetite.

Professor McAlister said: ‘The results varied, which is a good thing.

'Some kids knew very little about the brands while others knew them exceptionally well.’

The team found that among one group, 
exercise tended to offset the negative effects of too much familiarity 
with unhealthy food. But that finding could not be duplicated in the 
second group.

Professor 
McAlister explained: ‘The inconsistency across studies tells us that 
physical activity should not be seen as a cure-all in fixing childhood 
obesity.

‘Of course we want kids to be active, but the results from these studies suggest that physical activity is not the only answer.

The researchers wanted to find out whether a sedentary lifestyle and watching too much TV (illustrated with a stock image) makes children fat, or if it is the unhealthy food messages that children see on it. They think it is not just the TV time itself but what is learned through the brands

Parents spend on average £26 a month feeding their children fast food, pizza and burgers – and most lie to their friends for fear of being judged. 

A survey released last month found more than a third of children under 10 are eating junk food every day.

This is despite parents saying they try to monitor their calorie intake and worrying their children’s consumption of crisps and chocolate is 'out of control'. 

A fifth of parents admitted they regularly lie to others about how much pizza, chocolate and crisps their children are eating and 25 per cent said they lied because they felt guilty about the amount of junk food their children are eating. 

Almost half of parents confessed their children were overweight and 35 per cent said they think their child’s junk food consumption is out of control.

'The
 consistent relationship between brand knowledge and BMI suggests that 
limiting advertising exposure might be a step in the right direction 
too.’

She
 said that because children get most of their food messages from 
television, the question is what causes more harm - the sedentary 
lifestyle brought on by too much time in front of the TV, or the 
unhealthy food messages that children see on it.

‘From our 
results it would suggest that it’s not the TV time itself, but rather 
what is learned about these brands. It’s probably the developing food 
knowledge, not the sedentary lifestyle,’ she said.

‘What
 we’re trying to show here is just how young kids are when they develop 
their theory of food.

'As early as the age of three, kids are developing a
 sense of what food means to them.’

Co-author
 Professor Bettina Cornwell said the findings provide more insight into 
children’s relationship with food, which she describes as their ‘first 
language of food.’

She
 said the study proves it does not take long for children to work out 
what they do and don’t like and those choices often remain with them for
 life.
