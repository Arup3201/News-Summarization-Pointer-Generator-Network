In an effort to reduce her bills from the Montecito Water District  - which have increasingly surged over the last three years as a record drought continues to cripple California -  Oprah Winfrey has reportedly been sending a fleet of water tankers to her 40-acre Santa Barbara property to maintain her gardens.

The well-to-do residents of Montecito - the wealthiest suburb in Santa Barbara county - were warned in November that, without a 30 percent reduction in water at each home, the town would effectively run dry.

But rather than let their manicured grounds desiccate, locals like Winfrey have found other ways to keep the grass green.

Tankers carrying 5,000 gallons of water have been seen arriving at the gates of the former TV titan's $87 million palace, neighbors have told Politico.

That's alot of lawn: Oprah Winfrey is reportedly trucking in water to maintain the gardens on her 42-acre property in the super-wealthy Santa Barbara town of Montecito

Up-keep: The tanker trucks, carrying 5,000 gallons, are a way to offset penalty costs for water overage, which are increasing in California as the drought continues

Expansive: Winfrey's palace, which she bought in 2001, features six bedrooms, 14 bathrooms, 10 fireplaces, a gourmet kitchen, theater, wine cellar, a barn, two ponds, tennis court, a 4,500 sq. ft. guest house with pool and a man-made lake

As a result, Winfrey's bill from the Montecito Water District is said to have been halved.

Last year she paid $125,000 in water bills due to the amount it takes to look after her land.

Trucking in water as you need it can cost up to $15,000 a month.

California's water problem is still listed as a Stage 4 'exceptional drought'.

Montecito itself is known as having little to no natural water source and is considered the dryer than any other part of California's central coast.

Of the 13,500 residents in Montecito, 837of them were charged overage penalties in May.

However general manager for the Montecito Water District, Tom Mosby, said Winfrey is actively working to lower her consumption and help out with the crisis.

'She is the poster child for us,' he told Politico.

'She's doing her part.'

Among Winfrey's neighbors are Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi, director George Lucas, actor Rob Lowe and actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus.

The 60-year-old is currently renovating her 23,000 sq. ft. mansion.

Built in 1959, WInfrey bought the home in 2001 from Southern California industrialist Robert Veloz and his wife, Marlene.

It has six bedrooms, 14 bathrooms, 10 fireplaces, a  gourmet kitchen,theater, wine cellar, a barn, orchards, two ponds, an outdoor theater, tennis court, a 4,500 sq. ft. guest house with pool, an outdoor entertainment area and a man-made lake, according to Billionaire's Address.

The expansive home was last valued by Zillow at $87,987,066.00.

In 2012, Winfrey paid $904,239.00 in taxes.
