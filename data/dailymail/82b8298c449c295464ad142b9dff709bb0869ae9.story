Eye-opening: The site challenges common perceptions of who commits rape and where they attack

Rape victims who were attacked by men they trusted will share their stories on a French website.

More than 1000 shocking first-hand accounts have been submitted to the site called 'Je connais un violeur' - or 'I know a rapist' - since it launched at the end of August.

So far, 800 have been published.

In a statement on the homepage, women are invited to describe their tormentors.

It declares: 'They were our friends, our partners, members of our family, or acquaintances. We know rapists... Allow us to introduce them to you...'

The aim is to destroy myths about rape and rapists by asking victims to describe their attackers rather than go into the details of their rapes.

'You come across a daddy, a grandfather, a husband, Uncle Alain, a holiday fling, a colleague, a university professor, a friend of the family,' said Pauline, the site's creator.

Pauline, a 27-year-old former student at the prestigious school Sciences Po, describes herself as a militant feminist.

'The rapists are not "the others",' she says.

'We wanted to show that the rapist is not the ugly villain hiding in a car park or lurking on a street corner.

'In 80 per cent of cases the attacker is known to the victim and in 67 per cent of cases the rape takes place at the home of the victim or the aggressor.'

She spends two hours a day editing women's accounts, correcting special mistakes without altering the substance of their stories, removing the more lurid details of their rapes.

Pauline also ensures the anonymity of the women and their rapists is preserved as she says 'it is not a vendetta site and is not about revenge'.

By describing their rapists, the victims point the finger at men of all social positions.

Guilt: The 'Slut Walk' that took place in cities around the world was made to challenge the view that victims 'ask for it' by wearing a short skirt, low-cut top, or drink too much. However, many accounts on 'I know a rapist' state they feel guilty for those exact reasons. The Tumblr blog is filled with harrowing descriptions of distress

Pauline, the creator of 'I know a rapist...' hopes the accounts will help victims to find the support they need

Their accounts involve similar scenarios and confessions of guilt.

Many write: 'This is the first time I have told anyone,' or: 'Reading your accounts enabled me to understand at last.'

Many women describe their distress and pain.

One
victim wrote: 'His hands on my mouth, around my neck and his saying "It
will be OK. Shut up" whilst he went on and on.'

Many others speak of their guilt, saying they had too much to drink that night.

A
number of accounts say things like: 'it was as though I had asked for 
it by wearing too short a skirt,' or 'a top that left my back bare'.

The site, jeconnaisunvioleur.tumblr.com, has received more than 1000 accounts and published 800

Others speak of their regret at having done nothing to seek justice or to speak about their ordeal.

'I did not go to the Police,' wrote one. 'I remained silent for a long time. I recently heard that he had spent some months in prison for rape. But not for my rape.'

An estimated 75,000 women are raped every year in France but only 10 per cent are reported.

Only two per cent of rapists are convicted.

In an interview with Le Point magazine, psychiatrist Muriel Salmona said that sharing experiences - however painful - is of therapeutic value.

'What a relief it is for victims to know that they were not the only ones who were unable to speak about it, for fear of being faced with unbelieving family or friends; who had to forget everything over a period of years and who always had terrible doubts.'

Women's writer Swan Nguyen told the magazine: 'The victim's family and friends can play a key role in the process of healing by helping her to lose the feeling of guilt and by backing her when she finally makes a complaint.

She added: 'Being angry is fine but being able to transfer the anger against the person who has harmed you, that is better.'
