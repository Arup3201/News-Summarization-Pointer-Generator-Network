Police are investigating the death of a nine-month-old baby after she was left by her father for several hours in a hot car in Florida.

Steven Lillie opened his truck around 4:45pm Monday and discovered his baby daughter unresponsive in the back of the vehicle.

The infant had been left strapped in her car seat inside the closed vehicle in the sun for almost five hours.

Tragic discovery: Father Steven Lillie discovered the body of his baby girl in his car after leaving her behind in this parking lot while he went to work

Witnesses told Channel 9 Eyewitness News that Lillie was supposed to have dropped his daughter off at daycare on his way to work but apparently forgot.

Lillie arrived at the Fraternal Order of Police telemarketing office at 566 Barton Boulevard just after midday, as temperatures rose to the high 80s.

The car was a black Dodge pickup, reports Florida Today.

The parking lot outside a strip mall has no shade. Inside the truck, the heat would have risen to 100 degrees, reports Eyewitness News.

'The temperature would have been brutal,' Rockledge police Lieutenant Donna Seyferth said.

Lillie discovered his daughter almost five hours later and his screams alerted his coworkers that something was terribly wrong.

Lillie's coworkers called 911.

Fatal error: Police say a disruption in Lillie's usual routine caused him to forget that he hadn't dropped his daughter off with her caregiver before driving to work

Dangerous heat: The temperature rose to the high 80s Monday afternoon, and inside the sealed car would have reached up to 100 degrees

'The child was unresponsive when the officers arrived. They took as many life-saving measures as they could. Ambulance and rescue did the same, but the child did not survive,' Lieutenant Donna Seyferth told Channel 9.

According to WKMG, some disruption in Lillie's usual routine caused him to forget he had not dropped the baby off with her caregiver.

About four hours later, a family member asked him about the girl, prompting him to rush outside where he made the awful discovery.

Witnesses told WKMG that Lillie was so distraught by the discovery that he collapsed.

The baby was rushed to Wuesthoff Hospital but doctors were unable to revive her.

Police spent the evening speaking with Lillie. No charges have been laid but the investigation in ongoing.
