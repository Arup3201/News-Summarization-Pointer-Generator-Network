A couple have been forced to watch their home of nearly 30 years undergo demolition after an agricultural worker mistakenly dumped a staggering 150 gallons of diesel into their basement.

Brent Merriman and Michele Lowary were horrified when the unidentified Pendleton Grain Growers employee unwittingly pumped the fuel into their basement in Pendleton, Oregon, late last year.

Their property had used heating oil some years ago, and the driver had been confused about where to deliver the diesel, resulting in the costly mistake on November 24, a PGG spokesman said at the time.

Within seconds of the incident, diesel had seeped into the flooring of the basement and destroyed items in the room, while strong, dangerous fumes had permeated the air surrounding the property.

One of couple's cats, which was caught up in the diesel, had to be taken to a veterinarian for help, while officials fixed  ventilation tubes through the windows of the basement, Union-Bulletin reported.

At the time, Mr Merriman, 58, said he was worried the house he had owned for 28 years may have to be demolished because of the spill, which also led to safety concerns over the diesel's flammability. 

And now, his fears have come true after he and his partner were forced to watch workers in two excavators smash their beloved home and drop large chunks of it into a semitrailer.

Mr Merriman, who is now renting a house across the street with Ms Lowary, told the East Oregonian newspaper that the materials filled two trailer loads on Thursday, the first day of the demolition.

In need of help: In January, Ms Lowery posted a message to her Facebook friends, saying that she and Mr Merriman were looking for a home for their two adopted cats after 'losing our house due to a diesel spill'

The agricultural co-op's insurance is covering the cost of demolishing the home and building a new, larger one there. Rebuilding, however, will not start until the site is tested for contamination.

Following the diesel spill last November, the PGG spokesman said the company would work with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality and contractors to clean up the mess.

She added that it would take steps to make sure such a mistake is not repeated in the future.

Their now-demolished property was situated in Northwest Furnish Ave. On his Facebook page, Mr Merriman is listed at an engineering specialist at the Oregon Department of Transportation. 

The incident in November was the second diesel spill at a Pendleton home in less than a year.

A semi crashed March 1, 2014, on Highway 37, about a mile-and-half north of the city. Its trailer broke off, landed in a gully and spilled 5,000 gallons of diesel near a 109-year-old farm home.

That led to the removal of 20,000 cubic feet of earth, and the demolition of the old house.
