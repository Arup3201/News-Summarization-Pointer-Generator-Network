Dennis Rodman arrived in North Korea on Thursday insisting that his visit has nothing to do with the politics of the pariah state, where the uncle of leader Kim Jong Un was brutally executed just last week.

The eccentric NBA basketball star said he just wanted to 'have some fun' on his trip as he passed through Beijing on his way to Pyongyang.

Rodman had a glittering 20-year career in basketball, with spells at Chicago Bulls, LA Lakers, Detroit Pistons and San Antonio Spurs.

Greeting: Rodman shakes the hand of the country's vice minister of sport, Son Kwang Ho

The 52-year-old has been fiercely 
criticised over his friendship with Kim, who has imprisoned and murdered
thousands of his own impoverished citizens.

Last week, the dictator had his uncle 
Jang Song Thaek publicly purged and then executed, in a vicious U-turn 
against the man who was thought to be one of his closest advisers.

However,
Rodman has not called off his plan to spend the time between now and
Christmas Eve in North Korea, and is hoping to return next month to 
play a game of basketball in honour of Kim's birthday.

'It
has nothing to do with me,' he said in Beijing today. 'Whatever his 
uncle has done, and whoever's done anything in North Korea, I have no 
control over that. I mean, these things have been going on for years and
years and years,

'I'm just 
going over there to do a basketball game and have some fun. People have 
been saying these things here and there. It doesn't really matter to me.
I'm not a politician. I'm not an ambassador.'

Controversial: Rodman has always been an eccentric character, and focused on film and wrestling after leaving basketball

Media scrum: The star has been criticised for his friendship with dictator Kim Jong Un

He added: 'I'm just going over there 
to try and do something really cool for a lot of people, play some games
and try to get the Korean kids to play.

'Everything
else I have nothing to do with. If it happens that he wants to talk 
about it then great. If it doesn't happen, I just can't bring it up.'

Despite
pledging to stay away from politics, the former Chicago Bulls star also
said he was keen to build bridges between Kim and the U.S. President.

'Sport
is so important to people around the world so I hope this is going to 
engage the American people, especially Obama,' he added.

Rodman has visited Pyongyang on two 
other occasions, during which he spent time dining as a guest of Kim 
Jong Un, who he says he has a genuine friendship with.

Defiant: The former Chicago Bulls star said he would not discuss the execution of Kim Jong Un's uncle during his trip to the country

Journey: The star insisted he had no connection to the political issues surrounding North Korea

Training: Rodman is hoping to prepare North Korea's basketball team for a game against ex-NBA stars to celebrate Kim's birthday next month

Rodman is expected to provide North Korea's national basketball team 
with four days of training.

He also intends to return to Pyongyang in 
January with a team of fellow former NBA stars to hold basketball games on Kim Jong Un's birthday.

‘Dennis is 
going to spend a couple of days training the North Korean team to get 
them ship shape for the January match,’ Mr Scott said.

Meanwhile, North
Korea's young dictator appears to be trying to change the 
country's history as the population mourns the death of his father.

The
30-year-old leader has purged North Korea's state news archive, even 
removing the announcement of Kim Jong Il's death from two years ago.

On
Monday, thousands of North Koreans laid flowers outside the state 
mausoleum during a remembrance ceremony for their 'Dear Leader' on the 
second anniversary of his death.
