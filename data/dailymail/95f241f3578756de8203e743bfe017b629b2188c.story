The officers, who are on paid administrative leave pending an internal investigation by the Boulder Police Department, were released on $20,000 apiece, the Denver Post reported.

According to an arrest affidavit, Carter told police the day after the shooting that he encountered an elk on January 1 that he said was injured and needed to be put down.

Carter then blasted the animal with a shotgun, and Curnow, who was off-duty at the time, came to pick up the carcass with the help of an on-duty Boulder County sheriff's deputy, identified as Jeff George, the affidavit states.

Carter did not report the incident or notify his supervisors that he had fired his weapon that night, though he told investigators that he called in the incident and said he did not know why dispatch had no record of it, according to the affidavit.

However, cell phone records obtained from phone carriers for Carter, Curnow and George show the shooting was premeditated.

Guardian: The elk had been seen around the community for several days before he was shot

Carter texted Curnow at 2:56am, about ten hours before the shooting, on New Year's Day saying, ‘found wapiti (elk) you up?’ That was followed by a text at 4:14am saying, ‘Should I go hunting?’ Carter also texted George that night.

At 2:45pm, Curnow texted ‘You should have killed it’ to Carter.

Carter responded, ‘Oh he's dead tonight. His right side is broke off at main beam. And he looks a little smaller. He may not be wapiti, but he's gonna die.’

When Curnow texted ‘Get him’ to Carter after 10pm, Carter replied, ‘Too many people right now.’Two minutes before midnight, Carter texted ‘Elk down’ to Curnow.

All of the texts and phone calls from that night had been erased from Carter and Curnow's phones when they were seized for evidence.

Carter allegedly had also applied for a road kill permit with the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Department, saying the elk had broken an antler off.

Investigators believe Curnow had sawed the antler off.

Spirit: Many admired the elk for its grace

According to the Colorado Peace Officer Standards and Training Board, a Colorado police officer could lose his certification for any felony conviction or one of 43 misdemeanors, including first-degree official misconduct.

The Boulder Police Department is conducting an internal personnel investigation into Carter and Curnow In addition to the criminal investigation. Both officers have been placed on paid leave.

George also is subject to an internal probe, but he has not been suspended from duty.

The neighboring Colorado community was shaken by the 
loss of their beloved elk and held a walk to honor the creature while 
accusing the local police department of cruelly misusing their 
authority.

Several dozen 
residents of Boulder marched in a silent protest last Sunday, some blaring
elk calls on their outstretched cell phones.

'We're concerned about the larger culture of misconduct that needs to be addressed in order for taxpaying voters to regain trust in the department,' a resident involved in the walk told CBS Denver.

The walk was just one in a series of events for the late Big Boy. The week prior, the community held a candlelight vigil in his honor.

The massive creature was described as their 'guardian' by some.

Curnow had been with the department for 14 years, according to the Boulder Daily Camera.

The Daily Camera revealed that the suspended officer owns a taxidermy website, which advertises 'quality taxidermy at an affordable price,' according to the paper.

It is believed that Curnow and Carter were going to cut up the animal for its meat.

There were mixed reports from Boulder residents that the bull elk had been behaving aggressively before it was shot.
