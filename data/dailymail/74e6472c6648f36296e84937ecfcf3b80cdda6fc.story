Senior Conservatives today sought to insist David Cameron's plan to claw powers back from Brussels remain on course after Germany refused to 'tamper' with freedom of movement laws. 

The Prime Minister has vowed to put immigration at the heart of his renegotiation with the European Union, reassuring voters he will act to control the UK's borders.

But German Chancellor Angela has made clear she will not allow Britain's calls for reform to 'interfere with the fundamental principles of free movement in Europe'.

Angel Merkel has made clear she is not open to renegotiation on the free movement of people across the European Union

Mr Cameron is under growing pressure to announce a radical new approach to tackle soaring immigration from Europe.

The Prime Minister has promised to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU, before holding an in-out referendum by 2017.

Some senior Conservatives are considering a proposal to impose a quota on 'time-limited national insurance numbers' to limit the numbers of people able to move to Britain for work.

Others want an 'emergency break' to limit numbers coming from countries which suffer an economic collapse. 

Mr Cameron promised to cut net migration to the tens of thousands, but the figure has topped 200,000 after a surge in the numbers using freedom of movement laws to move from elsewhere in the EU. 

But Ms Merkel appears to have dismissed any hopes from Britain of radical change.

She told The Sunday Times: 'Germany will not tamper with the fundamental principles of free movement in the EU.'

There is agreement between London and Berlin on the need to limit access to benefits across the EU, but Ms Merkel is not open to negotiating the right of people to travel without restriction in member states.

A Romanian migrant took the German government to court to claim unemployment benefits despite not having had a job in the country. 

Mrs Merkel added: 'I spoke to David Cameron and we agreed to assess the verdict together. These are controversial issues that are debated also in our country.

'I am of the opinion that they need to be resolved in a way that tackles abuse.'

But she warned: 'On the other hand we must not interfere with the fundamental principles of free movement in Europe.'

David Cameron had indicated  migration reforms as key to mooted renegotiation of the UK's membership terms

Downing Street insists that Mr Cameron wants to limit the number of people who can come to Britain from the EU, not end freedom of movement altogether.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon denied that Mr Cameron's efforts to renegotiate the UK's relationship with the EU were already foundering.

'The negotiation itself hasn't started yet,' he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. 'We've set out the outlines, giving national parliaments more say over European legislation - who would disagree with that?

'Stopping people moving around Europe to claim benefits, that is extremely important.

'Having an open trading Europe that has less bureaucracy makes it easier to create jobs and wealth as we've done in this country.' 

Damian Green, a former Tory immigration minister, insisted that negotiations with the EU were at the very early stages.

'I think what you get at this stage, the stage before the negotiations starts, are people setting out positions from which they will negotiate. 

'Because we know that when we get to the details of the negotiations, there are always things that we want to do, actually that the Germans want to do, and other countries want to do. That seems to me to be the fruitful area where we can have a successful negotiation.'  

Ms Merkel's comments come after Brussels chief Jean-Claude Juncker this week said freedom of movement in the EU should be made easier.

Mr Juncker, who became European Commission president despite the fierce objections of Mr Cameron, told one of his new commissioners to 'promote freedom of movement' within the EU.

The revelation came as new polls suggests the public would vote to stay in the EU – even if Mr Cameron manages to secure 'modest' changes to Brussels rules.

If the PM could not secure any renegotiation at all, people say they will vote to leave the EU by 42 per cent to 36 per cent.

National Insurance numbers (NINOs) have been handed out to more than 420,000 people from the EU, up from 285,000 in the year before the coalition was formed

If Mr Cameron manages to secure 'substantial' changes people say they would vote to stay in by 55 per cent to 23 per cent.

But if he can only get 'modest renegotiation' a majority of the public say they would still vote to remain in the EU, by 44 per cent to 36 per cent.

The polling gave Mr Cameron hope that even small reform to European immigration rules could be enough to win public backing to stay in the EU.

Mr Cameron has pledged to hold an in/out referendum on Britain's EU membership by 2017 if he wins the general election.

He had set to outline plans to limit the number of European migrants joining the workforce within the next few weeks, according to Government sources – and was considering an 'emergency brake' that could be applied if numbers of incomers exceeded forecasts.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage this week congratulated Mr Juncker as his new team of 27 commissioners was approved - despite Mr Farage and other eurosceptic MEPs voting against him.

Further curbs on low-skilled EU migrants' rights to benefits, tax credits and national insurance numbers could also be introduced.

Outgoing European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso insisted last week that an arbitrary cap on EU immigration would be incompatible with EU law.

Mr Juncker's call for EU migration to be made even easier was a further blow to the Prime Minister.

In a letter sent last month, Mr Juncker told Ms Thyssen, a Belgian MEP, that she should be 'improving the conditions for geographic and professional mobility across Europe'.

He cited the EU-wide job exchange website EURES.

Wednesday's row came after Mr Cameron was urged by veteran Europhile Tory Ken Clarke to ignore backbenchers using the public 'hysteria' over immigration to drive Britain out of Europe.

The former Chancellor suggested the Prime Minister should let right wing MPs defect to Ukip so the party could get back to 'common sense'. He said: 'We mustn't compete with ignorance and bigotry.'
