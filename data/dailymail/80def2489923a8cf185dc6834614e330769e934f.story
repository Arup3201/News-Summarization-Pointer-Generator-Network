'A little soft': President Obama said he believed America had lost some of its 'competitive edge'

Barrack Obama claims the U.S. had 'gotten a little soft' in the last couple decades and needs to 'get back on track'.

The president was talking about the state of the economy during an interview with a local TV station from Orlando, Florida, when he made the comments.

He told WESH-TV’s Jim Payne: 'The way I think about it is, this is a great, great country that had gotten a little soft and we didn’t have that same competitive edge that we needed over the last couple of decades.

'We need to get back on track.'

Mr. Obama has faced heavy criticism for his handling of the economy, and the current unemployment rate  of 9.1 per cent is threatening his re-election bid.

He acknowledged that with the current economic climate it is a particularly 'challenging' time for young people.

He said: 'Even before the financial crisis hit, one of the reasons that I ran for president was that wages - incomes had flat-lined at the same time that costs were going up.

'I think people felt that opportunities were becoming more constricted for the next generation.'

'And that’s why making sure that we’re 
revamping our education system, making sure we’ve got world class 
infrastructure, investing in basic science, research and technology, 
making sure that we are moving manufacturing to the US, and that we are 
being tough with our trading partners, making sure that they’re not 
taking advantage of us.

'There are a lot of things we can do.'

However the president said he still wouldn’t trade the position of the US with any country on earth.

He explained: 'We still have the best universities, the best scientists, and best workers in the world; we still have the most dynamic economic system in the world. So we just need to bring all those things together.'

The president has been trying to gather support for his $447 billion jobs plan, which has faced stiff resistance from Republicans, and some Democrats, who say it would be paid for by ending a series of tax cuts.

He criticized Florida Governor Rick Scott claiming it was a 'mistake' to cancel a planned high-speed rail line linking Tampa to Orlando.

The Obama administration had offered $2 billion to Florida to help build the railway, as part of the president's high-speed rail initiative.

However Governor Scott rejected the 
funds claiming the plan may not be viable and there was a strong 
likelihood of it going over budget

But
 Obama said: 'Florida stood to make big gains and to create a lot of 
jobs down there…it was a mistake to turn that money down.

With
 the ending of the Space Shuttle programme meaning many of Florida's 
Nasa workers have lost their jobs, Obama said he remained committed to 
manned space flight.

amount' invested in the area

He said: 'Even with the shuttle program suspended, what we're trying to do is figure out how we can move as many of the folks - the engineers, the scientists, the technicians – into these new projects to develop that next stage of human space flight.'

'We've said let's emphasize human space flight. That's part of what makes America great.

'To do that we must take the time to transition, to develop technology, more effective rockets, making sure that as humans are in space longer, we figure out how to maintain environments for them.

'There will be a huge amount invested in that area.'
