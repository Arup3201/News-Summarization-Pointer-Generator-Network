A supermarket accounts worker has been jailed after using stolen gift cards to go on extravagant spending sprees which totalled around £400,000.

Jennifer Margaret Ward, 49, created an Aladdin's cave of expensive electrical items bought with ASDA vouchers she was supposed to be destroying.

When her home in York was raided, police found a room piled high with boxes of electrical items 
including widescreen TVs, digital cameras and DVD players and a stack of vouchers.

Along with her partner Alistair 
Gordon Lobban, 52, they also used money gained in the fraud to take 
luxury holidays and pay for meals out and entertainment.

The
pair are now starting prison terms after they were jailed for a total 
of three years following a investigation into theft and money 
laundering.

Ward pleaded guilty to charges of theft and possessing or having control of an article for use in fraud at York Crown Court.

She
admitted stealing at least £400,000 from her employers, ASDA on Jockey 
Lane, York and having in her possession, over £200,000 worth of Asda 
gift vouchers for use in fraud.

She was jailed for two years for each 
offence, to run concurrently.

Lobban was found guilty of money laundering by jury at Leeds Crown Court and was jailed for 12 months.

The
courts heard that between 2004 and 2010, the pair’s joint spending was 
'colossal', indulging in a lavish lifestyle way beyond their means.

Ward worked in the cash office at ASDA and was responsible for reconciling accounts and destroying used vouchers.

She
abused her position of trust to steal cash and vouchers and falsified 
the accounts which she returned to ASDA’s head office in the course of 
her work.

Ward spread the 
proceeds of her crimes across numerous bank accounts and spent thousands
of pounds on holidays and entertainment.

The pair were frequent 
visitors to the Star Castle Hotel in the Isles of Scilly.

When officers searched her York home 
they discovered more than £200,000 worth of ASDA gift vouchers and a 
hoard of electrical goods, ornaments, paintings and toiletries.

Detective Inspector Ian Wills said: 'This is perhaps one of the most bizarre investigations I have been involved in.

'On the face of it Ward appeared to be a hard working woman holding down her job at Asda and at several local pubs.

'However,
the search of her property following her arrest, gave a clear 
indication that both her and Lobban were living well in excess of their 
declared income and were amassing a fortune.

'It took two police search teams three days, working sixteen hours each day, to log and recover the vast quantity of goods that had been bought with some of the proceeds of the crime.

'Ward’s greed clearly got the better of her and led her to abuse the trust placed in her by her employers.'

DI Wills added: 'I would like to pay particular tribute to the work of Detective Constable Sarah Bullock and Financial Investigator Paul Dowsland who had the mammoth task of establishing their joint spending and accumulation of assets for presentation to the court. This has also been recognised by the His Honour Judge Bayliss QC in court today.'
