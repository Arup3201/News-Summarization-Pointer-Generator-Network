Attack: Former BMX champion Christopher Mahoney was spared jail after punching his ex-girlfriend in the face breaking her jaw in two places

A former BMX champion who broke his ex-girlfriend's jaw in a brutal attack as she pushed their child in a pram has walked free from court as a judge noted his 'competitive spirit'.

The ex-British champion, formerly ranked sixth in the world, was described as a 'callous and controlling bully' by the mother of his child, Michelle Prescott.

But standing in the dock at Liverpool Crown Court, Mahoney - a successful tattoo artist - was fighting back tears, his bottom lip quivering as he was sentenced for the attack.

Visibly upset, Mahoney was sentenced to 12 months behind bars.

But the judge suspended the sentence for two years, sending the 33-year-old free from court with a warning that if he commits any further violent offences he will be jailed.

Recorder William Waldron QC told the court: 'Perhaps in keeping with some of those who have a competitive spirit you were used to having your own way.'

The court heard that Mahoney had visited Miss Prescott's home to visit their two-year-old son in October last year.

The couple had been in a four-year relationship, but she described him as 'a bully, callous and controlling', the court heard.

Their relationship broke down in August last year.

Mahoney 'did not take it well', but made arrangements to visit his son regularly.

On October 27, when he called at Miss Prescott's home in Pemberton, Wigan, to pick up their son, but instead lashed out.

He told Miss Prescott he did not want to take their son, and when questioned as to why, the court heard he claimed he did not have to give a reason, and began slamming doors.

She rang her sister, concerned at his erratic behaviour, and while she was on the phone Mahoney tried to push his son away in the pram, prosecutor Christine Redmond told the court.

'She (Miss Prescott) tried to stop him, grabbing the pram and he punched her with an upper cut with his right fist making contact with her left jaw leaving her in real pain,' Ms Redmond said.

'She was still on the telephone at the time and was screaming and her sister said she would come round.'

Doctors at Manchester Royal Infirmary told Miss Prescott and her family that the blow to her face had fractured the right hand side of her jaw in two places, through referred force.

Miss Prescott, who has three older children, had to undergo surgery to insert metal plates and was in hospital for three days.

She has lost her sense of taste, leaving everything tasting of cardboard, has numbness in her lower lip and has had to move home with her parents.

Mahoney sent her a text apologising but in a Facebook message to a friend said that she had deserved the assault.

Kevin Liston, defending, said that RampParks have an ongoing interest in Mahoney and his BMX talents.

He added: 'He gives ongoing assistance to younger riders and there is clamour for him to return to competition.'

Confession: Mahoney, pictured arriving at Liverpool Crown Court, with an unnamed woman, pleaded guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm

The judge, Recorder William Waldron, QC, said that Mahoney had been a sportsman of considerable ability.

Mahoney claimed not to be able to recall the incident but the judge told him he believed that was 'a lack of memory through convenience'.

He said he had left his victim both physically and emotionally scarred and he was only suspending the sentence because it had been an isolated incident of violence which he had admitted.

He also has no previous convictions and had been on medication for depression at the time.

'It is said you are not only remorseful but regretful and ashamed and so should you be for what you did that day,' added Recorder Waldron.

He placed him under supervision for 12 months, imposed a restraining order and ordered him to pay Â£100 victim surcharge.

Mahoney, from Wigan, had pleaded guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm.
