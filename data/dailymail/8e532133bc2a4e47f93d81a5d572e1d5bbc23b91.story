Ebola fears have stopped more than 7,000 West African Muslims attending an annual pilgrimage after Saudi Arabia implemented a travel ban.

But the country said this year's Hajj had been free of Ebola and other contagious diseases because of measures it took to protect more than 2million pilgrims who took part in the annual Islamic event.

Pilgrims today began leaving the desert tent city of Mina, where they were taking part in the ritual of the stoning of the devil - one of the last rites of the Hajj.

Many headed back to Mecca, ending the Hajj as they started it by circling the cube-shaped Kaaba seven times. The Hajj, which lasts around five days, ends on Monday.

There were fears regarding Saudi Arabia's readiness to ensure a healthy Hajj for pilgrims after the kingdom became the epicentre for the potentially fatal Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers).

Several health workers and doctors died of that coronavirus in Saudi Arabia earlier this year, raising alarm about the safety of hospitals.

Acting Health Minister Adel Faqih told reporters that the kingdom deployed thousands of health workers during the Hajj and performed data screening on pilgrims upon their arrival as a precaution.

Mr Faqih said: ‘I am pleased to announce that the Hajj (was) free of epidemic diseases. May God accept the pilgrimage of our guests and ensure that they enjoy good health and wellness.’

He added on the sidelines of a press conference that the kingdom's ban on issuing visas to people from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea would remain in place for the foreseeable future.

The measure affects some 7,400 would-be pilgrims from the West African countries, which have been the hardest hit by the virus that is estimated to have killed more than 3,400 people.

‘That will continue until further notice until we are comfortable that it is not anymore an epidemic in these countries,’ Mr Faqih said.

About 12 per cent of the population of Liberia is Muslim, while more than a half are part of the religion in Guinea and Sierra Leone, reported Al Jazeera.

Only a handful of people in Saudi Arabia – where no Ebola cases have been confirmed - wore protective masks while circling the Kaaba.

MailOnline reported last month how Muslim pilgrims on their way to Mecca were tested for the Ebola virus at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport in Lagos prior to their trip.

More than 200 Muslims from Oyo State in south-west Nigeria underwent stringent health checks by Nigerian health officials. Nigeria is the only country in the region which has been affected by Ebola that had clearance to send pilgrims to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj.

The Hajj is one of the pillars of Islam, which must be completed by all adult Muslims at least once in their life if they have the financial and physical ability. Many travel thousands of miles to get there.
