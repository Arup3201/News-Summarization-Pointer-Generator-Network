Para-cycling could be missing from the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games after the sport's world governing body the UCI failed to get its paperwork submitted in time.

The sport was absent from the list of 16 announced by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) on Tuesday, and the UCI will have to wait until a meeting of the IPC board in January to learn if its late application has been successful. Para-cycling is among eight sports competing for a maximum of seven remaining places left on the programme for the Games.

A statement from the IPC said: 'The UCI only submitted its application late last week. As a result there was insufficient time for it to be assessed in time. The IPC management team will now assess the application, identifying any issues they may have with it, before the governing board discuss it at January's meeting.'

All sports had until July 28 to submit their application to the IPC.

Para-cycling has been key to Britain's successes at the last two Paralympics, accounting for a total of 25 gold medals in Beijing and London.

A maximum of 23 sports can be included in the Games, although the IPC may opt to include fewer.

Cycling is now up against canoeing, football five-a-side, football seven-a-side, judo, taekwondo, sailing and wheelchair fencing for one of the remaining slots.

'For the eight sports still in the running, we identified a number of issues with their submissions, or, in the case of UCI, it was submitted too late to be assessed at this meeting,' said IPC president Sir Philip Craven.

'These sports must now provide further information on the issues identified during the review process if they wish to remain part of, or join, the Paralympic programme.

'The IPC governing board will re-evaluate these applications when it meets in Abu Dhabi and will make its final decision on the number of sports, and which sports will be included in the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic sports programme.

'During its deliberations in Berlin, the governing board members particularly took into consideration the para-athletes who could be affected by the final decision. It is now up to the eight international federations to deliver the required information to the IPC.'

Among the 16 confirmed sports, badminton will make its debut alongside athletics, archery, boccia, equestrian, goalball, powerlifting, rowing, shooting, sitting volleyball, swimming, table tennis, triathlon, wheelchair basketball, wheelchair rugby and wheelchair tennis.

The IPC board will meet in Abu Dhabi on January 30 and February 1 to make a final decision.

The Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games will be held from August 25 to September 6, 2020.
