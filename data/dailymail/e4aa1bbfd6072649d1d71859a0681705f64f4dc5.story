Michael Jackson's former personal chef Kai Chase has opened up about how Paris and her siblings have coped in the wake 
of their father's death.

During a testimony in the Jackson family's wrongful death suit against AEG Live regarding Michael's death, Chase revealed the 15-year-old, who is currently recovering in hospital following a failed suicide bid, is 'devastated and lost'.

She also revealed that Paris no longer wants parties for her birthday since her father hosted a private circus for her when she turned 11.

'She's been devastated and lost': Michael Jackson's former personal chef has opened up about how Paris has been suffering following her father's death

Chase said: 'Being daddy's little girl, Paris is devastated. She's devastated and lost. She's trying to find herself and find who she is. It's 
taking a lot of love and understanding to keep her together. She breaks 
down, she cries, she talks about him.'

Jackson's former personal chef Kai Chase testified in his wrongful death trial

Earlier in her testimony, she described an April 2009 birthday party 
for Paris that included a private circus. The Cirque du Soleil-style 
show featured men on stilts and a woman performing in a giant balloon, 
Chase said.

Paris Jackson, who was turning 11, adored her father and Chase helped
decorate a room filled with posters and photos of the Thriller 
singer. The singer's music was played throughout the party.

It was the last birthday party the 15-year-old has had. 'Paris hasn't
had any birthdays since,' Chase said. 'She hasn't wanted to celebrate 
since'.

And youngest son Blanket, who remains home-schooled, wears a T-shirt with his father's image every Friday, she said.

A video deposition of Paris from 
March was shown as part of the trial on Tuesday, as the teenager is 
still too unwell to testify in person.

The videos were used after lawyers for the Jackson family told the judge that Paris, who is suing the concert giant along with her grandmother Katherine, 83, and siblings, would be unable to testify in person due to the fact that she is still recovering in hospital.

Katherine's lawsuit claims AEG failed to properly investigate Dr. Conrad Murray, who is serving a four-year prison sentence for involuntary manslaughter over the 50-year-old star’s death, and pushed the superstar to rehearse and perform a planned series of 50 comeback shows titled This Is It.

Lawyers acting for Paris, Prince Michael, their brother Blanket, 10, and Katherine contend that pressure from AEG led to Jackson’s death from an overdose of surgical anaesthetic in June 2009, two weeks before his This Is It concerts were to begin at the O2 Arena in London.

Both Paris and her brother Prince are listed as potential witnesses in the case, which is in its sixth week of trial.

Paris claimed in a video deposition from March that her former nanny Grace Rwaramba, seen here visiting her at hospital, was 'obsessed' with the singer

However, in the video testimonial from March which was replayed on Tuesday, Paris claimed that her  former nanny Grace Rwaramba, who has visited the teenager in hospital since her suicide attempt, was 'obsessed' with Jackson.

She said: 'My dad didn’t like her so he tried to keep her away from us. He would send her to run errands a lot… He said she was sneaky, she was not an honest person and she lied a lot.'

Paris added in the footage: 'She used to be (one of the nannies) but she got really creepy. This is going to freak you out. One time, it was before - me and my brother were really young - before Blanket was born.

'When he would stay in a hotel, or 
whatever, she would call the hotel and say that she was his wife. She 
was obsessed with him… They let her in and he’d wake up and she would be
in his bed.'

Marvin S. Putnam, a defense attorney
for AEG Live, said Paris and Prince Jackson were deposed in the case 
because they are named plaintiffs. He said Paris' testimony was not a 
'grilling' but urged privacy for her and her family.

'There's
a real person involved here,' Putnam said. 'There's a 15-year-old girl 
and something incredibly tragic has happened that none of us know why 
and I think it would really be in everyone's best interest and 
particularly in her best interest if rather than blowing this up into 
something else, that they were given a little bit of privacy to deal 
with something that has to be a tragic, tragic moment for all of them.'

'She's 15,' he said. 'Someone should give her a break.'

According to TMZ, legal papers reveal
the famous offspring are asking for $10 billion for all of the future 
earnings they claim their father would have generated if he had he 
lived.

father would have generated if he had he lived

According to the website the family want an additional $50 million for various other damages.

AEG,
which denies any liability for the star’s death, says the huge figure 
is based on speculation and that Jackson’s career was on a downward 
spiral.

Legal analysts say the billions being claimed are unlikely to be awarded and are a legal tactic to get publicity for the case.

Depressed: Paris, pictured in May, is said to have attempted suicide after discovering that she and her older brother Prince didn't share the same biological father

Still recovering: The 15-year-old is still in hospital following her failed suicide attempt earlier this month

Just days prior to her suicide bid, Paris was reportedly told that she does not share the same biological father as Prince.

Then, over the days that followed, Paris spiralled into depression and was admitted to the UCLA medical centre hospital after cutting her wrists and taking an overdose of pills on June 5.

Whilst the teen is said to be feeling better, she could remain in hospital for another month.
