New York’s sky-high cigarette taxes have led to more than half of all packs sold in the state being smuggled in illegally, a new report has revealed.

The 56.9 per cent of packs sold illegally in New York are the highest percentage in the country, according to the Tax Foundation, and are likely a direct result of the state having the highest cigarette taxes.

The Empire State levies a $4.35 cent per pack tax on smokers jonesing for their fix. Packs bought in the Big Apple also face an additional city tax of $1.50 – bringing the total cost per pack to as high as $15 within the five boroughs.

New York’s high taxes are not alone in causing high rates of illegal smuggling across state lines.

Arizona’s 51.5 per cent of packs sold illegally place it second in the nation, New Mexico and Washington come in at 48 per cent each, and Wisconsin rounds out the top five at just under 35 per cent, according to the Tax Foundation.

Arizona’s $2 per pack tax ranks twelfth in the country and is one of the highest in that part of the country, according to Fox News.

‘Public policies often have unintended consequences that outweigh their benefits,’ study author John Henchman wrote, according to Fox News.

‘One consequence of high state cigarette tax rates has been increased smuggling as criminals procure discounted packs from low-tax states to sell in high-tax states,’ he continued.

Nowhere is that practice more prevalent than in Manhattan, where people walking through Chinatown and Midtown come across people hawking cigarettes almost as often as they try to sell counterfeit bags and sunglasses.

This anecdotal evidence is backed up by another study cited by the Tax Foundation which found that almost 60 per cent of all packed tossed in the trash come from outside the five major northeast cities surveyed.

The states with the highest rates of outbound smuggling – New Hampshire (24.2 per cent), Wyoming (22.3 per cent), Idaho (21.3 per cent), Virginia (21.2 per cent) and Delaware (20.9 per cent), according to the study – coincidentally ranked among the lowest in per pack taxes in the nation.

Smugglers try to hide their illicit activities with counterfeit state tax stamps, by hijacking trucks and selling knock-off cigarettes, according to the report. In some instances, officials even turn a blind eye to the sales.

As much as $5billion a year in revenue is lost each year to illegal cigarette sales, according to U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives statistics cited by Fox News.
