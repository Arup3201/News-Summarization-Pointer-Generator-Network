Liverpool Crown Court heard Paula Clinton was brutally stabbed by her husband, John, after she 'goaded' him over the size of his manhood

A man inflicted multiple fatal stab wounds on his wife after she taunted him about this size of his manhood, a court heard.

John Clinton, 52, brutally attacked Paula Clinton, his partner of 24 years, before slashing his own throat in a bid to end his life.

Liverpool Crown Court heard Mrs Clinton became disgruntled about her husband's heavy drinking and - on the day she was killed - he arrived home from the pub to find her discussing their prospective divorce over the phone.

Clinton, who had drunk 10 pints, plunged a knife into his wife's back four times during a row at their home in Aintree, Liverpool, on November 28 last year.

Jurors heard Clinton, a partner in a company that makes concrete products, would regularly stop at the pub on his way home.

On the day she died Mrs Clinton had been to visit the Citizens' Advice Bureau to discuss dividing the couple's assets. 

She was on the phone to one of their advisers when Clinton came home drunk.

The
mother-of-two, who worked at the Giro social club in Bootle for 30 years, 
was seen staggering from the family home and down the street bleeding heavily before 
collapsing.

She had multiple stab wounds to her body, 
hands and her left eye and died from shock and blood loss before paramedics arrived.

Armed
police were called to the family home where they found Clinton had
slashed his wrists and neck in a 'serious attempt' to kill himself.

There was blood all over the house, including splattered on a set of papers marked 'ending a marriage'.

Clinton, who admits manslaughter but denies murder, told detectives he had killed his wife after he just 'lost it'.

He told police his wife was pushing him and goading him, asking who would look after him with his bed-wetting and small manhood.

'This man, with 10 pints inside him, lost 
his temper but still had the presence of mind to go into the kitchen, 
select a knife from the drawer and go after his wife with it'

                                 - Ian Unsworth, QC

Ian Unsworth, QC, told Liverpool Crown Court: 'It is apparent that the marriage was in some difficulties in the days leading up to her death and on the day itself.

'Paula was seeking advice as to divorce and the financial arrangements which would follow.

'According to things she said to others, the reason she sought a divorce arose largely out of the defendant’s drinking, culminating with an incident in October when he was stopped by the police as he was driving his vehicle and had drunk in excess of the legal limit. 

'That seems to have been the last straw so far as she was concerned.'

Mr Unsworth said Clinton had threatened his wife with a knife a few weeks before her death and that 'in drink he had become a bully and a dangerous one at that'.

He added: 'No doubt the defendant bitterly regrets his actions that night but it is clear from what he has said that he does seek to justify his actions, at least in part, by painting a picture of his wife and her conduct which is not a true picture.

'Whether it was the revelation that his wife was seeking financial advice of her own or something else that happened, this man, with 10 pints inside him, lost his temper but still had the presence of mind to go into the kitchen, select a knife from the drawer and go after his wife with it.'

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
