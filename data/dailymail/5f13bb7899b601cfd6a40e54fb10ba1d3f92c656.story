A Connecticut couple are letting customers at a Starbucks coffee shop choose the name of their baby.

Twenty-five-year-old Jennifer James and 24-year-old Mark Dixon of New Haven say they’ve been struggling between two names for the boy they are expecting in September.

They decided to put it to a vote and placed signs at the Starbucks on the New Haven Green, where they are regulars, asking people to vote for either the name Jackson or Logan.

They come into the coffee shop almost every day, and know the baristas and some other customers by name.

They set up a Starbucks to-go cup plastered with little blue hands and feet and a sign next to it which reads: 'Help us choose our son’s (first) name, Jackson or Logan.' 

So far, they have received about 1,800 votes in the coffee cup serving as a ballot box, and say ‘Logan’ is leading.

For anyone interested in swaying the vote, there is still time as the baby poll closes next Tuesday, reports the New Haven Register.

The expectant parents have so far received over 1,800 votes and it looks increasingly likely that their first born will be called Logan

The couple says they will post the winning name in the store.

The couple are saving the voting papers and plan to glue them together in a collage for the baby's scrapbook.

'He’s going to love it. We’ll tell him we read the paper every day, everything that we see we cut out for him. We’re saving the paper of things that happened leading up to his birth, and now he’ll be a part of that,' Dixon said.

The couple met at a party when they were 18, and have been together for the last three years. They plan to get married in the future.
