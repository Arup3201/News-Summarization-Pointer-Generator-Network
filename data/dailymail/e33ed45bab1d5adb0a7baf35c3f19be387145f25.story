A judge has set a trial date for a man charged in the case of the 'Grim Sleeper' serial killings that spanned two decades in Los Angeles.

Lonnie Franklin Jr., who has pleaded not guilty to ten counts of murder and one count of attempted murder, will stand trial on June 29, it was announced today.

Jury selection will begin the following day, according to Superior Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy.

During the court hearing today, frustrated families urged the judge to move the case forward after years of delays, and cited Marsy's Law - a voter approved bill of rights that allows families of victims the right to a speedy trial.

Franklin, 62, could face the death penalty if convicted of the killings that occurred between 1985 and 2007. 

The nickname 'Grim Sleeper' was coined because of the gap between slayings in 1988 and 2002.

Police arrested Franklin in July 2010 after his DNA was connected to more than a dozen crime scenes. 

They had linked the crimes, but did not have a suspect until a crime lab computer traced the sample to one of Franklin's family members.

An officer posing as a busboy at a pizza parlor got DNA samples from dishes and utensils Franklin had been eating with at a birthday party.

Franklin's trial date is set to begin on June 29 and jury selection will begin the following day, according to Superior Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy (above Franklin and his attorney Louisa Pensanti during the court hearing)

Relatives of victims (family members of victim Alicia Monique Alexander: Sherry Alexander, right, and husband Darin Alexander, left, pictured in 2010) urged the Los Angeles Superior Court judge to set a trial date citing Marsy's Law, a voter-approved victim's bill of right allowing family members of the victims to testify

Attorney Salarno Ashford has successfully argued three times to have trial dates set so the victims could have their day in court (above officers remove items from Franklin's home after he was arrested in 2010 by a SWAT team in LA)

As news of the trial date has been announced, attorney Nina Salarno Ashford, a board member of Crime Victims United, said it is not unusual for capital cases to take years to complete.

However Marsy's Law, which was passed in 2008 and cited by prosecutors during the court hearing, gives victims some leverage in speeding things up though it is still not widely used, she said. 

August 10, 1985: Debra Jackson - A 29-year-old cocktail waitress who went to take a bus home after visiting her friend's house. Her body was found three days later with three gunshot wounds to the chest.

August 12, 1986: Henrietta Wright - The 35-year-old was found dead in an alley near West Vernon Avenue. She was shot twice and wrapped in a blanket and covered in a mattress.

August 14, 1986: Thomas Steele - The only known male victim of the serial killer. The 36-year-old was found with a single gunshot wound to the head in the middle of a street intersection.

January 10, 1987: Barbara Ware - The 23-year-old had been shot once in the chest and her body had been dumped under a pile of rubbish.

April 15, 1987: Bernita Sparks - 26-year-old went out to the shops but never returned. Her body was found in a bin, covered in rubbish. She had been shot, strangled and beaten.

October 31, 1987: Mary Lowe - 26-year-old left home to go to a party, but never returned. Her body was found in an alley of Western Avenue.

January 30, 1988: Lachrica Jefferson - Officers found the 22-year-old's body with a napkin over the face with the word 'AIDS' written on it.

September 11, 1988: Alicia Alexander - Another victim killed while going to the shops. The 18-year-old's body was also found in an alley near Western Avenue.

December 21, 2001: Princess Berthomieux - The end of the 14-year hiatus. DNA on the 14-year-old's body matched those of previous killings.

July 11, 2003: Valerie McCorvey - 35-year-old had been strangled and sexually assaulted.

January 1, 2007: Janecia Peters - 25-year-old was shot in the back and her body was dumped in a rubbish bag. 

Marsy's Law, guaranteed for defendants, can be extended to family members of victims.

It also allows victims to address the court, and Porter Alexander, who spent more than 20 years wondering if his daughter's killer would ever be caught, was among those who addressed the court. 

Attorney Salarno Ashford has used the law to represent victims throughout the process, including cross-examining witnesses at trial.

She has also successfully argued three times to have trial dates set so the victims could have their day in court.

'It's always been a fault in our system that defendants were able to play a shell game and delay things,' she said.

Deputy District Attorney Beth Silverman said the case has been plagued by delays with no end in sight and that the judge has failed to hold the defense to strict deadlines to complete their investigation.

However, defense lawyer Seymour Amster blamed the prosecution, and said his expert found DNA from another man at three of the crime scenes and is seeking to test more material because the evidence could help his client. 

Amster said the prosecution has opposed releasing the items for testing and have asked for more time to prepare their response.

'There are rumors that I'm trying to delay this thing,' he said. 'I'm really not. I'm a strong proponent of do it once, do it right.'

Silverman said that she recognizes the need to balance Franklin's right to prepare for trial, but that the court must balance that with the rights of the victims and the community. 

She said those rights have already been compromised.

A firearms expert who tested guns retired last year, so the testing needed to be done again. 

Medical examiners and a supervising criminalist at the coroner's office have retired and will need to be replaced. 

And the mother of victim Mary Lowe died more than two years ago, depriving her of the chance Alexander and other victims' families will have to address the court.

'It's a waiting game,' said Alexander, whose 18-year-old daughter, Monique, was killed in 1988. 'I need to keep up my strength. I hope I'm here for the ending.'
