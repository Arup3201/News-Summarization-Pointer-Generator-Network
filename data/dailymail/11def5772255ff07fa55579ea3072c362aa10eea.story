Amelie Mauresmo believes that Andy Murray can round off their first five months working together by regaining his place in the much-vaunted Big Four by the end of next week.

The 27-year-old Scot can make the jump from his current position of number six if he enjoys success at the Barclays ATP World Finals that begins on Sunday, and Mauresmo he is in the form to do it.

'He could aim for the win there. I think for him the important thing is going to be to try to finish the year at No 4. There is a possibility of that,' she said as Murray stepped his preparations at London's Queen's Club.

Stan Wawrinka is 420 points ahead of Murray at four while Kei Nishikori is 150 points above. The long and short is that the British player may have to win at least two matches although one might do, depending on how the Swiss and the Japanese fare.

'Andy has won many matches, beating top 10 players again, which he hadn't been doing for a while, though he did beat Jo (Wifried Tsonga) at the US Open,' she said. 'That was important. That was another step I wanted him to feel. The other step was to win tournaments. I wanted him to feel what it was like to finish the week without losing.

'Obviously he's a little bit tired, but he's also in great confidence. Maybe it balances that tiredness a little bit. But we're looking forward to the end of the tournament here and London, to maybe start 2015 in a better position.'

Mauresmo is also anticipating the window they will have together in the off-season, and it sounds like developing his undoubted volleying skills and using them more regularly at the net will be on the agenda.

'I think he has the ability to do it probably a little more often than he does. It's not an easy process. I think it's also not a fast one. I think we're both looking towards that. 

'You can't do everything at once. He needed some confidence back. He needed many things before getting to this part of the work. Really other priorities were there before this specific area of his game.'

'When you're like Andy and you can do many different things, you have to choose the right shot at the right time. And that's not easy to do. He's trying to have perfect shot selection but it's not easy.'

Murray's appointment of a female as coach, first revealed by Sportsmail, has been one of the season's main talking points and the former women's number one is delighted how they have gelled on a personal basis.

'We're getting on well together. Personally I wouldn't be able to work with a man or a woman player without having a good connection, a good feel for each other. It doesn't happen immediately.

 I'm not the type of person who opens up that easily, he also. It took a bit of time, but the relationship is good. It's something that is good for both of us, I would say.'

She admits that a reluctance to travel was almost a stumbling block to their arrangement, but she is ready to commit to half the year on the road with him. 'The down part for me, as I see it, is definitely the travelling, but I accept it and I'm ready to do it, as long as he wants me to and as long as I also want to do it.'

It has also helped that gets on well with his other coach Dani Vallverdu plus the physios and coaches that make up the team. 

The big test for her relationship with Murray is likely to come next year, but she feels he is in good shape to train on after his recent tear through Asia and Europe that qualified him for London.

The Scot will be looking to be back and among the most elite players ranked in the world, like Roger Federer

'It would be hard not to be pleased with that,' she said. ' After New York he was not in a great position to enter the Tour Finals. It was decided that he was going to go for it, have a few weeks in a row, we were not sure exactly how many and a lot would depend on the results he had in Asia.

'Then it was pretty clear he had to do the six weeks in a row, he did great and all the credit to him fighting like crazy and physically holding up well. 

'His body and his back, there was a question mark there, all the work that has been done as recovery part of the plan was great. He should be proud of the last part of the season, he has been winning a lot of matches it gives him quite a lot of confidence.'
