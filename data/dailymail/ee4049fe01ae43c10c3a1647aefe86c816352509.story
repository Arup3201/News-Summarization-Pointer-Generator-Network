Graduates who study at superior universities do not have a higher income than those who studied at a less distinguished technology university.

Mapping Australian Higher Education, a new report from the Grattan Institute, reveals that earning a lot of money does not come from attending an elite universities, rather it is about choosing the correct university degree. 

Undergraduate students who graduate from a commerce degree at University of Technology Sydney or RMIT University will make $3.2 million during their career, the same amount one would earn if they graduated from University of Sydney or University of Melbourne, institutions that are considered to be more prestigious, Sydney Morning Herald reports.

These findings have not stopped the superior Group of Eight (Go8) universities from claiming their institutes have better performance rates and higher entrance scores.

Times Higher Education Supplement's recent release ranked University of Sydney 60th and University of Melbourne 33rd among international institutions, while UTS was placed between 226 to 250 and RMIT not even ranked in the top 400. 

'The starting salaries and career earnings results both suggest that research-based prestige is not particularly important in the Australian labour market, at least for bachelor degrees,' it reads in the report.

'The technology universities either do not rate or get low ratings in the research-driven international rankings, but their graduates earn as much as those from Group of Eight universities, which dominate research funding and rankings.

'Group of Eight universities get good results partly because they take students who would do well wherever they studied.'

But the report also found that graduates from Go8 or technology universities do earn more than students who study at suburban or regional institutions. 

Those working for 40 years after graduating from commerce generally earn $200,00 more if they studied at a Go8 and technology university, disadvantaging regional graduations by 6 per cent when it comes to lifetime earnings.

This follows this year's federal budget, after the government allowed the Group of Eight universities to charge any amount of money for a degree.

But findings from the report indicates prestigious universities are not what it is important to get ahead.

'The report shows that when it comes to earnings, what you study matters more than where you study,' Grattan Institute higher education program director Andrew Norton said. 

'Studying engineering at any university is likely to lead to a higher salary than studying arts at a sandstone university,' Mr Norton said.

The report's findings are only applicable to undergraduates.
