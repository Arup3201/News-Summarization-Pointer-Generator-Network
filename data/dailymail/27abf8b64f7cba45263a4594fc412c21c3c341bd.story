The worst she ever risks is a bruised ego.

So Gwyneth Paltrow faced heavy criticism yesterday after she compared being slated online to fighting in a war.

The Hollywood star said of comments posted about her and her celebrity friends on social media: ‘It’s almost like how, in war, you go through this bloody, dehumanising thing.’

Shot down: Gwyneth Paltrow sparked ridicule after she compared herself to a soldier fighting in a war

Military mother's wrath: Cindy McCain, wife of ex-POW Senator John McCain, mother to two soldiers (left), blasted Gwyneth Paltrow's (right) suggestion that actors ridiculed on the internet are like soldiers at war

But her remarks caused an immediate backlash.

Cindy McCain, the wife of US war veteran and former presidential candidate John McCain, attacked Miss Paltrow as ‘a joke’.

She said: ‘Her life is like taking bullets for a soldier. What a joke! My two sons serving in the military should talk to her.’

The US organisation Veterans For Peace said that the 41-year-old actress ‘doesn’t understand what it means to be in real danger’.

Miss Paltrow was said to have made her comments outside a conference in Los Angeles at which she made a surprise appearance on Tuesday.

The Oscar-winning Shakespeare In Love
 star was reported as saying: ‘You come across [comments] about yourself
 and about your friends, and it’s a very dehumanising thing.

'It’s almost like how, in war, you go through this bloody, dehumanising thing, and then something is defined out of it.’

Not holding back: McCain's tweets came after Paltrow's comments while speaking at a tech conference. She's was surprisingly uncensored for a politician's wife

Miss Paltrow – who infuriated working  mothers earlier this year by suggesting they had it easier than famous acting mothers – added: ‘My hope is, as we get out of it, we’ll reach the next level of conscience.

'It’s taken me a long time to get to the point where I can see  these things and not take it as a personal affront and a hurt.

‘I see myself as a chalkboard or a whiteboard or a screen, and someone is just putting up their own projection on it.’

Mrs McCain responded on Twitter: ‘Perhaps Gwyneth Paltrow should go out on patrol with some soldiers. Kind of like a Red Carpet in her mind I guess!’

Senator McCain’s plane was shot down 
by friendly fire over Vietnam in the 1960s. He was taken prisoner by the
 Communists and suffered five and a half years of horrific abuse.

He
 returned home to be awarded the Silver Star, Bronze Star, Purple Heart 
and Distinguished Flying Cross before he launched his political career.

'Consciously uncoupling': Gwyneth and Chris announced their split after 10 years of marriage in March

The spokesman for Veterans For Peace said Miss Paltrow, who is famously estranged – or ‘consciously uncoupled’ – from her husband, Coldplay singer Chris Martin, ‘doesn’t understand what it means to be in real danger’.

The veterans’ spokesman added: ‘Not someone talking to you on the internet, but actually having bullets shot at you.

‘I’ve gone to war and had that kind of fear. She’s not in a situation where she can compare the two.

‘She hasn’t had to fear for her life and not know whether she’d make it home.’

Miss Paltrow also used a military analogy a few weeks earlier when she responded to criticism with a blog on her website headlined Ending The Mommy Wars.

‘Why do we feel so entitled to opine, often so negatively, on the choices of other women?’ she wrote.

‘As the mommy wars rage on, I am constantly perplexed and amazed by how little slack we cut each other as women.’
