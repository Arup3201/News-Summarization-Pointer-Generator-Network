Racing is usually a serious business for the royal family but at Ascot today, Prince Charles was met  a  sight so comical it triggered a fit of giggles.  

He and Camilla, Duchess of Cambridge, joined onlookers at the Lamb National, in which agile Herdwick sheep hurtle around a specially-built course, leaping over special jumps on a grassy course. 

The event, which was part of the Prince's Countryside Fund Raceday, clearly tickled Charles who was forced to cover his face as he roared with  laughter at the farm animals' antics.

Perhaps it was the sight of the sheep's cuddly toy 'jockeys' that made the prince roar with laughter?

Camilla laughed along with him, clearly enjoying the sight of the  sheep clad in their multi-coloured coats hurtling around the course.

And each one had a little  'rider', a cuddly toy dressed a jockey's uniform, holding on to the sheep's reins

The couple were flanked by Conde Nast president Nicholas Coleridge and Conservative MP Nicholas Soames, who looked equally amused by the fluffy runners.

Charles has an added interest in the race as he's patron of the Campaign for Wool (which sponsored the event), a initiative he launched  to raise awareness of British wool in fashion, interiors and industry.

The  sheep were running along the specifically designed course to win a place in the Winners' Enclosure 

While on a blustery spring day, Camilla found herself battling the wind which threatened to blow off her beige velvet and fur hat away.

Clutching her headgear with both leather gloved hands, Camilla, who looked elegant in a tweed coat with velvet trim, a silk scarf and knee-high brown suede boots, found her coat whipped open.

And as the rain fell, she opened up her clear umbrella as protection against the elements.  

The couple, who recently returned from a tour of the US, seemed delighted by the rural display and as well as the sheep, the pair marvelled at stalls displaying traditional English wares such as slabs for dry stone walling.

There was the 'Quack Pack', duck herding display and a Gold Bunny Easter hunt where anyone spotting a flash of gold bunny ears or hearing a bell ring will have found a clue.

Meanwhile Ferret World offered visitors information and the chance to meet these furry animals. 

Added to the day were saddle and wool-making displays.

Charles and Camilla also visited the Heritage Harvest stand to meet people helping farmers grow heritage cereals for thatching straw and grain.

Any money raised from the day goes to the Prince's Countryside Fund, which supports rural areas in Britain.

And and Dec attended the event, and took part in a live Q&A with fans.

But later as the horse racing began, Camilla had her turn to shout with excitement as the runners stampeded by.

Peering at the course through his binoculars, Charles watched the race and Camilla clutched her fist in excitement.

The royals also presented jockey Tony McCoy with a framed print on his last race at Ascot in the Waitrose Novices' Handicap Steeple Chase.  

The pair watch the racing with great interest, with Charles using a pair of binoculars to get a closer look
