Someone put him out of his misery!

If this clip is real, it shows an unfortunate old French man looking like he's never used a vacuum cleaner before.

He is seen apparently trying to crank-start the electrical appliance into action like an outboard motor, using the plug cable.  

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

A 13-second video has been posted on Facebook showing an elderly man trying to crank-start a vacuum cleaner

It didn't work, because the vacuum cleaner is an electric appliance, and he was using the cord that should go in a plug socket

Of course, it doesn't work. So he tries again. And again.

The 13-second video was posted on Facebook by 28-year-old Fabien Rossi, from Picardie, France, and has so far been shared nearly 50,000 times.

One user posted: 'That is not an outboard motor or chainsaw to have to pull the cord/chain/rope to start it!

'Some people fail to read directions and then curse the machine for not doing its job. READ THE MANUAL or ask any three-year-old how it works!' 

Another said: 'Designed by men and generally used by women... just like pushchairs and baby chairs.'
