For most woman, hair is a part of their feminine identity and shaving it off- no matter how good the motivation- is a big deal.

For a model, whose entire career revolves around their appearance, the sacrifice of voluntarily stripping themselves of their hair is perhaps even greater.

But lingerie model Lizzie Adams bravely took a razor to her long brunette hair to raise money for Breast Cancer awareness charity CoppaFeel!, with her new husband looking on.

Lizzie hopes to raise a total of £10,000 for the charity for shaving her head

This is in fact the second time Lizzie has cut off her hair for charity after becoming motivated to fund raise when her own father was affected by cancer

The courageous newlywed – who has modelled for Curvy Kate and is a Star in a Bra winner- set the bar high when it comes to fundraising, at £10,000, and so far she has managed to raise just over £7,500 with donations still flooding in.

No stranger to fundraising, Lizzie cut her long hair to a short bob in 2005 after her father was affected by cancer, managing to raise an impressive £3,500.

But before the chop last week, her hair was the longest length it had ever been and she pledged to go one better and shave her head entirely after seeing the work of CoppaFeel! at a recent lingerie event.

Lizzie explains, ‘It’s as much about awareness and keeping it in the public eye as it is fundraising, this is happening to women in my demographic, to women who are my friends and it is more important than ever for everyone to sit up and take notice’.

She adds, ‘Curvy Kate is working with CoppaFeel! on several initiatives this year and as an ambassador for the brand I have to support the good work that they will be doing, along with the amazing efforts of CoppaFeel!’

She took the brave step on Valentine’s Day as she wanted to promote the idea of loving yourself and your boobs whilst emphasizing the importance of CoppaFeel!’s message to check your breasts.

The charity’s mission is to make sure all breast cancers are diagnosed at the earliest stage possible, making treatments more effective and survival rates higher.

Almost 50,000 women and 400 men are diagnosed with breast cancer in the UK each year and CoppaFeel! is determined to educate and remind people to ‘know theirs boobs’ in order to catch breast cancer early.

The charity was set up by Kristin Hallenga in 2009, who at 22 was told she was ‘too young to get breast cancer’.

This meant that her cancer was diagnosed late and could only be treated, never cured.

Kristin comments: ‘We're thrilled that Lizzie is supporting us with this hugely brave endeavour! The funds she has pledged to raise us will make a huge difference to CoppaFeel! and the vital work we do.

'The added great support from Curvy Kate has ensured that her brilliant idea and our message is heard by even more people. (And she really did have lovely hair!)’

The hair she had chopped off will go to Little Princess which is a charity that provides real hair wigs for childrenwho have lost their hair to cancer.
