Kalvert's career began in the late 1980s, when the first music video he directed, Parents Just Don't Understand by Will Smith and DJ Jazzy Jeff, was a massive hit.

He went on to direct videos for other artists including Cyndi Lauper, Mark Wahlberg in his Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch incarnation, Bobby Brown and Snoop Doggy Dogg (currently Snoop Lion).

Kalvert then turned his talents to films, turning his favorite book, the 1978 memoir of Jim Carroll, 'The Basketball Diaries', into a film of the same name starring a then-unknown Leonardo DiCaprio as Carroll and Lorraine Bracco as his mother. Wahlberg also starred, setting all three on the road to stardom.

Kalvert made only one other film, 2002's 'Deuces Wild,' about rival New York street gangs in the 1950s.

He studied film at Emerson College in Boston and won an MTV competition which led to his first directing job with a New York-based production company.

He moved to Los Angeles in 1990.

Most recently, Kalvert had been running his own production company, Alliance Media Group.

He is survived by his wife Sonia, two daughters, Madison and Tyler and his mother, father and brother.
