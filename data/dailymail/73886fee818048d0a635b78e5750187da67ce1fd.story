It may look like an anonymous drone, quietly cleaning your apartment while you work.

However, one filmmaker has revealed the secret life of the Roomba, and the zigzag paths in takes as it cleans.

Using just a headlight and a warning beacon taped to the Roomba, Gavin Heffernan created these stunning images.

The Roomba robo-cleaner as you've never seen it before: Gavin Heffernan attached lights to the gadget to take these timelapse images. The result is a psychedelic clip including a variation of mirroring effects that yield symmetrical designs.

Gavin Heffernan of Sunchaser Pictures has previously created time lapses of natural environments like the star-splashed skies above Joshua Tree and Toronto during an ice storm.

However, he became fascinated by the patterned sequences of the Roomba he bought to clean his apartment.

'I recently purchased an awesome IRobot roomba vacuum cleaner (as part of my neverending quest to make household chores tolerable),' he said.

'After watching the cute little circular robot zoom across our floors with endless gusto, I decided to try and attach different lights to the top and shoot some timelapses.

'I then 'stacked' the images the same way I would create star trails, using STARSTAX.

'The result was a psychedelic look that I had a lot of fun with! To amplify the patterns, I used a variation of mirroring effects to create symmetrical designs.

'For lights, I used a camping headlamp and a flashing rescue beacon.

'Blue pool ball shots were created using glow in the dark golf balls provided by friend/producer Michael Darrow.

'Arcade screens were composited in after to avoid stacking.'

Gavin Heffernan of Sunchaser Pictures said the lighting effects were achieved using a camping head lamp and a flashing rescue beacon.

A headlamp was also used to show the artist moving around the room, leaving a ghostly glow in midair

The lighting effects were achieved using a camping head lamp and a flashing rescue beacon, and the pool balls were actually glow-in-the-dark golf balls.
