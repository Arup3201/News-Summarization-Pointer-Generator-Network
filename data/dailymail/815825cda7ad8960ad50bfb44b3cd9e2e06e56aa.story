A Chinese stunt driver has broken the world record for parallel parking by squeezing into a space just 3.15in bigger than his car.

Han Yue slid his Mini 3-door hatch into the tiny space with barely more than an inch and a half to spare on either side to claim the new world record at the China Drift Championship in Chongqing.

He beat the previous world record, set by British driver Alistair Moffatt, by just over half a centimetre. Experts had thought Mr Moffatt's record of 3.4in spare was unbeatable.

A tight spot: The parking space that Han Yue managed to manoeuvre his Mini into to break the Guinness World Record for the tightest parallel parking job, shaving 0.6cm of the previous record

Mr Han, who had previously held the record before Mr Moffatt took it in July 2013, achieved his incredible parking job with a power drift into the gap between the cars.

Video footage of the feat showed him driving in a curve towards the space at fairly high speed, before at the last moment activating the handbrake and sliding his vehicle into the tight space.

Mr Han's record is the latest in a quick escalation of parallel parking feats. As recently as 2012 the record for space to spare in a parallel park was 8.26in - more than double today's standard. 

He set the record on Friday, a day earlier than scheduled after rain was forecast to fall on Chongqing on Saturday. 

Moving in: Mr Han began his manoeuvre by accelerating in a circle towards the parking spot

Handbrake turn: He activates the car's handbrake once the front is in the perfect position

Super skid: Suddenly brought to a halt, the momentum of the car swings it into position in the tiny space

Perfect! Mr Han managed to park his vehicle with the merest hint of clearance to the one behind

But Mr Han didn't stop there. He also teamed up with fellow stunt driver Zhang Shengjun to take the rather unusual record for the most donut spins around a car driving on two wheels.

Han told Guinness World Records his motivation for the attempts was to bring the parallel parking record back to China and highlight that his nation has world-leading drivers.

Footage of his second record-breaking feat can be viewed on that website.
