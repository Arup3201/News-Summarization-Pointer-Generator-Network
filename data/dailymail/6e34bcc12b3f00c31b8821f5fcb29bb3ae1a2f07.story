Millions of men over 50 are more at risk of dying from cancer than women because they still do not recognise the symptoms and refuse to see a doctor.

Experts warn there has been  little improvement in men’s  knowledge of the disease, and in their unhealthy lifestyles, despite a series of awareness campaigns.

Each year around 82,500 men in the UK lose their lives to cancer, making it the leading cause of death in the male population.

Concerns: According to survey of 12,000 over-50's almost half do not know the signs of prostate or bowel cancer

One man dies every hour from prostate cancer.

According to a survey of 12,000 over-50s, almost half do not know the signs of prostate  or bowel cancer, while women are better informed.

A similar number do not visit their GP about health problems, with one in four refusing to do so even if they are in severe pain.

More than a fifth need to be chivvied into seeing their doctor by  worried family members.

The survey also shows almost two-thirds of men do not eat the recommended five-a-day of fruit and vegetables, compared with half of women, and one in five does not exercise. The findings come after figures revealed cancer death rates in the UK are more than a third higher in men than in women.

Confidence: A posthumous advert featuring Bob Monkhouse, who died from prostate cancer, inspired men to be more vigilant with the disease

Although the difference is partly due to men developing hard-to-treat cancers such as those affecting the bladder, oesophagus and liver, doctors and charities also blame men for not paying attention to their health.

The death of entertainer Bob Monkhouse from prostate cancer ten years ago led to a posthumous TV advert five years later which used special effects to show him urging men to be vigilant.

But only 59 per cent know the symptoms of prostate cancer, which is predicted to be the most common cancer by 2030.

Signs include trouble urinating and blood in the urine.

By contrast, 82 per cent of women can identify breast cancer signs. Men are also less likely to recognise bowel cancer, with 55 per cent saying they would know the symptoms compared with almost three-quarters of women.

Meanwhile, just over a third of men know how to spot lung cancer – the biggest cancer killer of both sexes – compared with half of women.

Slightly more are aware of skin cancer, with 54 per cent of men knowing the signs compared with  71 per cent of women.

Mark Flannagan, of Beating Bowel Cancer, said men can be too embarrassed to talk and leave it too late before visiting GPs. ‘Bowel cancer is more treatable if spotted and diagnosed early,’ he said.

The survey, by Saga Health Insurance, found the eventual  rate of prostate cancer in boys born today will triple compared with the current rate, of  around 41,000 men a year.

Owen Sharp, of Prostate Cancer UK, said: ‘We all need to generate more open conversations about men’s health and we hope that with the likes of Billy Connolly [who has been treated for prostate cancer] speaking out about their personal experiences, more men will be inspired to seek advice.

‘Prostate cancer kills one man every hour but it can be treated if caught early enough.’
