Found: An autopsy showed preliminary results that Katelyn Wolfe, who disappeared from her home on June 6, died from asphyxia

Two men charged with murdering a 19-year-old girl and updating her Facebook afterwards to hide their actions allegedly told police they did it because they 'wanted to know what it feels like'.

Jordan Buskirk, 26, and Randall Crosley, 25, from Jasonville, Indiana, have been charged with the murder of Katelyn Wolfe.

The teen went missing from her Linton, Indiana, home on June 6.

Her body was found four days later in a lake bound with duct tape and rope, with an anchor attached to her body.

Investigators revealed today that Buskirk described the slaying as 'just something that popped into their heads'.

Court documents state: 'Jordan Buskirk explained that he and Randal Crosley had previous 
conversations about forcing themselves on a complete stranger for at 
least a week.

'The initial plan was to rape and then 
murder. Jordan Buskirk explained that it was just something that popped into 
their heads. He advised that it just crossed their heads to try to do 
it.

'He explained that they were not targeting Katelyn Wolfe, but they were 
just going to target somebody. Jordan Buskirk explained
 that the opportunity was just there for Katelyn Wolfe.'

The men used Katelyn's phone to update her Facebook status after they murdered her, police said.

It read: 'Trying to party looking for fun. Out on a walk with creeps that keep driving by.'

Buskirk and Crosley face charges of  conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit rape and criminal confinement.

Police were told by Buskirk that he and Crosley had bought handcuffs, condoms, restraint straps, rope and a 20-pound weight, in preparation for a rape and murder, the Indy Star reports.

The probable cause affidavit stated 
that the two men picked up Wolfe at around 1am and drove around doing 
drugs before tying her up with duct tape, strangling her with a rope and
 killing her.

It is alleged that the two men then 
put Wolfe in the back of their car, updated her Facebook status and then
 threw her in the lake with 20-pound weights strapped to her body.

Linton Police Chief Troy Jerrell said the family was able to confirm the body was Katelyn from a photograph provided by investigators.

He also said the two men are believed to have intentionally killed Wolfe: 'They knew what they were doing all along,' Jerrell told ABC News 
affiliate WRTV in Indianapolis.

'We don't believe it was an accidental 
type thing.'

He declined to elaborate on what led police to the suspects, who were both being held at the Greene County Jail in Bloomfield.

Katelyn was Facebook friends with one of the suspects - Buskirk, reported WHTR.

His page shows him 
holding a toddler and his last status update reads: 'Watching a true 
original classic... Texas Chainsaw Massacre.'

Crosley's page shows a baby and he posted: 'I am now officially a happily-married man,' in March.
