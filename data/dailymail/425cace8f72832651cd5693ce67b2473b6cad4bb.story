You can say one thing for Prince Andrew – he certainly has a type.

For the second time in a matter of months, the prince has been seen in public with a stunning brunette lingerie model almost half his age.

This week at Royal Ascot he entertained Dara Tomanovich – a Canadian who has modelled lingerie for Marks and Spencer – in the Royal Box.

Royal Box: Model Dara Tomanovich chats with Princes Andrew and Harry at Ascot on Wednesday

And Miss Tomanovich – who was pictured talking to the Duke of York, 54, and his nephew Prince Harry on Wednesday – was back at the race meeting again yesterday, still sporting her coveted Royal Box and Royal Household badges.

It comes after Andrew was linked in February to another underwear model, Monika Jakisic, 34 – nicknamed ‘the Croatian Sensation’ – who had previously dated George Clooney.

When Miss Jakisic tweeted a picture of a diamond ring shortly after the pair  were seen dining together, Buckingham Palace aides were forced to issue an unprecedented statement denying the two were engaged.

Last night Miss Tomanovich, who is signed to one of the most prestigious model agencies in New York, Wilhelmina, remained tight-lipped about whether she was romancing the single prince.

‘We do not comment on Dara’s personal life,’ said an agency spokesman.

Miss Tomanovich has been a successful model since the age of 18, having been  the ‘face’ of designer Chloe, appeared  in Vogue and having also been photographed by the legendary fashion cameraman Patrick Demarchelier.

Her agency’s website describes her as being 5ft 9in, having a 26in waist and a 34B bust with hazel eyes and brown hair.

Coincidentally, she appeared alongside Clooney in an advert for Fiat cars and says on her Twitter feed that she rides a Ducati motorbike.

Buckingham Palace declined to comment last night.

It is understood that all of the guests who are in the Royal Box are given Royal Household badges to wear as an additional form of identification.

A source said Prince Andrew – who divorced Sarah, Duchess of York in 1996 – had invited a number of guests to join him at the race meeting during the week.
