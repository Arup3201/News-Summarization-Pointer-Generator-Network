A ram raid gang used JCBs to tear out cash machines in high streets across Britain, stealing more than £400,000.

Joseph Upton, John Smith, Albert Smith, John Christopher Smith and Alfred Stanley targeted 12 banks over a nine-month period, making off with more than £300,000 from the ATMs.

They also burgled six homes, stealing cars and jewellery worth more than £100,000 as well as leaving a quarter of a million pounds worth of damage in their wake.

The raiders smashed into banks in Norfolk, Cambridgeshire and Suffolk as well as breaking into homes

One raid in Cambridge saw them steal £76,000 in one go after tearing into a shop and leaving a family homeless in the process.

The five-man gang all face lengthy jail terms after admitting the burglaries across Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire and Suffolk in 2012.

The men were only caught after they were convicted of another violent robbery. 

Upton, Stanley, John Smith and Albert Smith were each jailed for 10 years for an attack on an isolated farm in October 2012. 

Police officers then discovered they were behind the cash machine smash and grabs, with the men hauled before court this week.

Thug: Alfred Stanley also pleaded guilty and can expect a lengthy jail sentence for the smash and grabs

Albert Smith and John Christopher Smith both admitted being involved in the raids during a hearing at Cambridge Crown Court

Upton, 43, John Smith, 39, Albert Smith, 38, Stanley, 37, all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to burgle and conspiracy to steal motor vehicles. 

John Christopher Smith, 23, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to burgle during the hearing at Cambridge Crown Court.

They were then investigated by officers who were able to link them to the smash and grabs on the ATMS.

Police have now released CCTV showing the thieves using a stolen JCB to tear into the wall of one bank to rip an ATM away from a wall.

The break-ins caused around a quarter of a million pounds worth of damage to banks and homes

And John Christopher Smith, 23, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to burgle during the hearing at Cambridge Crown Court last week.

Following the case, Detective Sergeant Stuart Dolan said the gang caused 'misery' for the victims of their crime.

'This was an organised gang who targeted homes in order to steal vehicles to ultimately use as getaway vehicles after smashing into shops and banks to steal ATMs,' he said.

'They caused misery for the burglary victims as well as causing a huge amount of damage to shops and banks across the region.

'This case shows we will relentlessly pursue those we suspect of being involved in organised crime and continue to put them before the courts.'

The five men will be sentenced on Tuesday.
