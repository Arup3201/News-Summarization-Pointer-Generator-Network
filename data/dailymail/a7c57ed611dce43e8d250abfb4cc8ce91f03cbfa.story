David Cameron has recruited a ‘vanity photographer’ from the Ministry of Defence despite axeing thousands of troops in spending cuts.

Corporal Tom Robinson has been seconded from the MoD as Mr Cameron’s personal photographer at No 10 two years after a public outcry forced the Prime Minister to get rid of his own Downing Street cameraman.

Cpl Robinson, 33, who has served in Afghanistan, was seen last week coming in and out of Downing Street in his ‘civvies’ after taking photographs of Mr Cameron meeting foreign dignitaries.

It means the Prime Minister has effectively got round what appeared to be a self-imposed ban on having a so-called vanity photographer.

Downing Street last night defended the decision on the grounds that its use of Cpl Robinson as an in-house photographer has not cost the taxpayer a penny because he is already employed by the MoD.

Andrew Parsons, the photographer who lost his job in the November 2010 row, was paid £35,000 a year from the Downing Street payroll.

How do I look? The Prime Minister has effectively got round what appeared to be a self-imposed ban on having a so-called vanity photographer

Earlier this month, nearly 4,500 Army personnel were told they were being made redundant, and Labour MP Michael Dugher said last night: ‘At a time when soldiers are being sacked, it is scandalous that David Cameron thinks it is more important to have a vanity photographer.’

Mr Dugher, MP for Barnsley East, South Yorkshire, added: ‘He should spend more time mending the economy and less on his ego.’

However, friends of Mr Cameron dismissed the criticism. ‘Every other major political leader has their own photographer and it is ridiculous to criticise the PM for this,’ said one.

‘It is nothing to do with vanity, but about having  an official photographic record of what the PM  is doing. These photographs are widely used all around the world. Downing Street is run on a shoestring compared  with every other prime minister or  president’s office.’

One official challenged claims  that taking Cpl Robinson away  from the MoD undermined Mr  Cameron’s demand for big defence cuts in the run-up to this week’s spending review by Chancellor George Osborne.

The official said: ‘The MoD has dozens of photographers and 400 press officers, so they should do something about that before whingeing about losing one photographer to No 10.’

Cpl Robinson, a combat photographer, has been in the Army for  ten years and was in the thick of  the action on a tour of Afghanistan in 2010, filming soldiers fighting  the Taliban. His footage of David Beckham visiting the British base  at Camp Bastion was shown around the world.
