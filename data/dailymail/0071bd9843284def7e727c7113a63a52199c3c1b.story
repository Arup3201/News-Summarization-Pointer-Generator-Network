By the time an ambulance arrived Miceli had been without a pulse for 25 minutes.

She never regained consciousness and was put on life support.

Miceli then died in hospital on January 6, 2009.

The wrongful death lawsuit brought by her family in 2010 said Miceli voluntarily admitted herself to hospital after suffering a severe asthma attack.

However when doctors tried to discharge her several hours later, Miceli, who insisted she needed more treatment, panicked and fought with hospital personnel, the lawsuit said, according to The Times-Picayune.

Miceli was accused of biting the ankles of a hospital security guard.

She was then booked on municipal charges of disturbing the peace, resisting arrest and battery on an officer and taken to the jail.

The federal lawsuit claimed that jail staff didn't provide adequate medical care to Miceli and caused her death with the restraints.

However the  DA's office determined there was no criminal wrongdoing by staff at the Orleans Parish Prison.
