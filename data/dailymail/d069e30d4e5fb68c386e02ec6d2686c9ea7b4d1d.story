Allegations: Dr Humayun Iqbal is accused of molesting two junior colleagues at a hospital in Newcastle

A senior doctor groped a trainee surgeon before telling her, ‘well that’s what juniors are for isn’t it?’, a medical tribunal has heard.

Dr Humayun Iqbal, 40, had been conducting a private anatomy lesson when he allegedly forced himself upon the woman and tried to steal a kiss before putting his hand down her blouse.

When his junior colleague protested and told him to get off, Iqbal is said to have replied: ‘I have to practise for my wife’, later adding:  ‘At the end of your rotation you will be begging for it.’

The woman, known as Dr B, was one of two junior female colleagues molested by Iqbal while he was working as a registrar, a General Medical Council hearing has been told.

The fitness to practise panel heard that Iqbal ‘manipulated’ his victims and behaved inappropriately towards them under the charade of teaching.

Peter Atherton, counsel for the GMC, said: ‘In each of these cases Dr Iqbal manipulated his victims by the offer of teaching and learning assistance to them.

‘Common to both is the emotional and mental turmoil that they both then experienced.

‘In particular their great concern was how they were going to deal with this unexpected, totally inappropriate behaviour at the start of their careers.

‘Of course they were both anxious to make a good impression on their seniors and equally they were most concerned for their personal reputation.’

The alleged incident involving Dr B occurred in December 2009 after Iqbal invited her for ‘further teaching’ in an empty coffee room.

Iqbal asked the woman an anatomy question and when she answered correctly he hugged her before tightening his embrace and then forcibly kissing her, it was alleged.

Mr Atherton said: ‘Her reaction  was to object and rebuke him for  what happened but he started to  say totally inappropriate things such as ‘‘I have to practise for my wife’’  and ‘‘well that’s what juniors are for isn’t it?’’

‘He also invited her to attend a course with him in Canada. When she made it clear his advances  were not welcome he said ‘‘at the end of your rotation you will be  begging for it’’.’

Later, after she moved hospitals, Iqbal allegedly sent the junior surgeon an offensive text which prompted her to make a formal complaint against him.

The text said: ‘A good boss is like a bra – always supportive and never lets you down, a bad boss is like Pampers – always stuck to your a***.’ The second alleged victim, known as Miss A, was a nurse practitioner who had just started training at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle upon Tyne.

Iqbal was said to have lured her to a lecture theatre in November 2009 under the pretext of ‘demonstrating relevant anatomy’ before fondling  her breast.

The woman was left feeling ‘like a rabbit caught in the headlights’ as a result of Iqbal’s unwanted sexual advances and made an entry in her diary saying: ‘Awful day. Iqbal.’

She told the hearing: ‘He was drawing pictures of lungs and different incisions, he touched me on the back first, below my right shoulder blade and moved his hand right around towards the front.

‘He moved his hand from the back to the front, my right breast. I was just a bit shocked. I don’t know, he could have drawn it on the diagram. I just moved away and I sat back.

‘My heart was racing. I felt like a lump of jelly. I knew I had gone bright red, blushing, and he asked me if I had allergies – he touched my left cheek and I said ‘‘no’’.’

Following the incident the woman lost weight, suffered sleepless nights and struggled to do her work, it was claimed.

'Totally inappropriate': The General Medical Council was told at a hearing in Manchester that Iqbal had 'manipulated' his alleged victims by offering to teach them

She added: ‘I just felt very uncomfortable because he touched me. I had 
just started working there and I didn’t want to cause any trouble. I 
just wanted to get on with him.’

Miss A reported the incident after she attended an interview with a 
consultant the following February and confessed her spell at the  
hospital had been ‘unhappy’ because of Iqbal.

A nursing colleague of Miss A told the hearing in Manchester: ‘She said 
she had had a terrible experience after a day in theatre with Dr Iqbal. 
She said he had behaved inappropriately with her and she was frightened.
It had had quite an impact on her.

‘She demonstrated on me what he had done and I felt uncomfortable, she 
was touching me in that area so I felt embarrassed, it wasn’t a 
lingering it was a hand sweep.

‘She lost a lot of weight and she said she wasn’t sleeping and she was struggling in her work.’

In a subsequent hospital trust disciplinary proceeding relating to both 
women, Iqbal claimed Dr B had made ‘profoundly racist’ comments towards 
him. He claimed he had only taken her to the coffee room to tackle her 
over a complaint made about her work. His allegations are firmly denied 
by Dr B.

Iqbal, from Ponteland, Newcastle, denies misconduct.

The hearing continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
