When Mary Mulry was born in Caltra, Co  Galway in 1921, no one could have foreseen that a couple of months after her 19th birthday, she would be working as a nurse in wartime, tending injured survivors of the Dunkirk evacuation.

Her mother died when Mary was just three weeks old, and she was brought up by her beloved aunt in a part of Ireland  so rural that the family transport was a donkey and trap.

Her father, a poetry-loving visionary who fought alongside Michael Collins and Sean MacEoin in the Irish War of Independence, passed on his passion for ideas and his independent-mindedness to Mary.

There were few opportunities for work in Ireland. Mary’s elder brother, Michael, emigrated to America, while Mary travelled to London in 1939 to begin training as a nurse at Guy’s Hospital. During her probation she began an intimate diary, which is now in the Imperial War Museum.

The day she started her journal, May 31, 1940, began like any other. Mary noted that ‘Staff Nurse Jones reduced me to tears twice before the 9am break’. But then the order came to prepare the ward for casualties, and a fleet of ambulances arrived bearing injured Dunkirk survivors.

Among the most seriously wounded was Private Brian Mullins, so severely burned that his naked body had to be suspended on straps above his bed. ‘He is about 18 — my age,’ Mary noted.Captain John Evans, the skipper of the Brighton Belle, which sank on its second return trip across the Channel, ‘got off lightly’ with a broken leg. He described the motley fleet of coasters, paddle steamers, fishing boats and pleasure boats that joined the rescue mission as ‘the queerest and most nondescript flotilla that ever was’.

Mary had a narrow escape when a London hotel where she was staying on leave was bombed in the Blitz, and she took part in the Normandy landings, where patients and nurses were lodged in tents, the water supply was 2km away, and the sterilising equipment was so primitive that she commented: ‘I am sure Florence Nightingale was better off in the Crimea.’

3,076 British nurses lost their lives during World War Two.

Throughout it all, Mary’s sense of humour and her high spirits rarely failed. In Normandy there were dances with the RAF and a string of dashing chaps keen to take her out to dinner.

But a note of melancholy was never far away. ‘Transient fleeting friendships are a part of the war,’ Mary wrote. ‘There is never time to get to know anybody, and for some there may not be a tomorrow.’

One man she did manage to keep in touch with was Malcolm, a subaltern whom she met on a blind date in Normandy in 1945. Unlike Mary, who had won prizes in Ireland for her dancing, Malcolm’s sense of rhythm was hopeless, but he made up for it with ‘a lovely sense of humour’.

Love in a  time of war: Mary met her future husband Malcolm Morris, while on active service in Belgium.

He was four years younger than Mary — ‘I feel quite ancient at times, have seen too much suffering,’ she reflected. Just two weeks after they met, he asked her to marry him, and she accepted.

Their marriage would last until Mary’s death in 1997, aged 76, but they faced plenty of obstacles during their engagement, not least the question of what Mary could wear as a wartime bride.

‘I never realised that getting married entailed such a lot of fuss,’ she complained. Resourceful as ever, she wrote to a London film studio, asking to borrow one of their gowns, and they offered her a white Elizabeth dress and lace veil worn by the actress Flora Robson. (There is photograph of Mary on her wedding day, looking fabulous in her borrowed finery).

Mary is a talented writer and a humane observer of her remarkable experiences. Her diary is full of vivid, sometimes shocking vignettes, such as the starving German prisoners of war admitted to the Belgian hospital where she was working in December 1945.

‘What are we to feel or say when prisoners come in from our own PoW camps suffering from . . . advanced starvation,’ she wrote furiously, predicting that ‘this little episode will be covered up . . .  nothing of it will reach the newspapers or the people at home . . .’

But nothing crushed Mary’s spirits for long. Soon she had organised the entire ward — the Germans working alongside their former enemies — into making Christmas decorations: ‘The ward is in a state of happy chaos — most un-military, but I am determined that [it] will be a happy place this Christmas.’

In a postscript to this fascinating and deeply moving book, Mary’s daughter Kathryn reflects on the courage and sense of adventure that took her mother as a teenager from rural Ireland to the dangers of nursing in wartime Europe. ‘She had great empathy for others, and was determined to do something useful,’ she writes.

It is an epitaph that anyone would be proud of.
