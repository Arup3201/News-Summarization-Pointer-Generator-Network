Germany should pay reparations to Greece for ‘serious wrongs’ by the Nazis, members of Angela Merkel’s ruling coalition said last night.

The German Chancellor has angrily rejected demands from Greek ministers for Berlin to pay £240billion in compensation for Nazi atrocities during the Second World War.

But, in an astonishing twist, senior members of the SPD, which shares power with Mrs Merkel, yesterday disagreed.

Senior figures in Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition partner in government  have united with the Green Party to declare Germany should compensate Greece to the tune of billions of pounds for wartime Nazi atrocities

Gesine Schwan said: ‘I think it would be good for us Germans to sweep up after ourselves in terms of our history. It is about recognising that we have committed serious wrongs in Greece.

‘The government’s legal case isn’t convincing. It leaves a bad impression that Germany doesn’t want to face up to its responsibilities.’

Ralf Stegner, SPD deputy leader, said: ‘We should not link the question of compensation with the current debate on the euro crisis. But I am of the opinion that we need to discuss compensation regardless.’

Green party parliamentary group leader Anton Hofreiter said: ‘Neither morally nor legally is this chapter complete.’ About 250,000 Greeks died during the brutal Nazi occupation.

Greece’s new hard-Left rulers are demanding billions in return. Justice minister Nikos Paraskevopoulos said this month that German assets in Greece could be seized.

Athens is demanding general compensation as well as specific claims for massacres and forced loans.

Some senior German politicians view the Greek demand for up to £250billion  in reparations for the Nazi occupation as a ploy to gain more time and money to settle its chronic debt crisis. Pictured is an anti-austerity and pro-government demonstration in Athens that took place in February

German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble has said: ‘They won’t get their debts paid by conjuring German obligations from World War Two.’

Mrs Merkel’s spokesman said the question was ‘legally and politically closed’. But Eberhard Rondholz, a historian who has studied the issue, told the Financial Times: ‘The government view is false. This issue is not closed – it is very much open.’

Spiegel news magazine yesterday said lawyers have told Mrs Merkel the Greeks may have a case. It says that a £2billion loan the Third Reich secured from Greece in 1942 was never repaid – £10billion today. Germany paid Greece £50million in 1960, but Athens says it was not enough.
