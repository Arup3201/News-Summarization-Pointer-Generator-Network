Gun enthusiasts are up in arms over a video game. Not over a violent game such as Grand Theft Auto, where players regularly kill prostitutes, shoot innocent bystanders and thieve cars.

No, the NRA is fired up over a game based on the beloved animated family The Simpsons. The Simpsons: Tapped Out is a video game for iOS and Android that has proved wildly popular.

In a press release from EA, makers of the game, it's described as 'life-ruiningly fun'. Gamers can create their own virtual Springfield, collect characters and go on missions such as 'partying down with the Duff Man at the Duff Brewery' and 'growing Tomacco on Cletus' farm'.

Taking aim: Gun enthusiasts are angry at the blatant lampooning of the NRA and gun enthusiasts in the last level of The Simpsons: Tapped Out

So far, so unpolitical.

The problem for gun-toting game critics comes when they reach level 30 and get a free content update for the game. According to SimpsonsWiki.net, level 30 is at present the highest level players can reach.

At level 30, a storyline involving Herman's Military Antiques store evolves that contains some fairly clear commentary on gun laws in the U.S. and takes some cheap shots at the organization.

SimpsonsWiki.net pulled some quotes from the level that has the NRA gunning for the game.

'You’re the perfect gun owner! Step inside!' says Herman to Grandpa Simpson who has just told him how poor his vision and aim are, and how he often mistakes loved ones for intruders.

'Hey, Milhouse, want to go check out the new gun shop in town?' Bart asks Milhouse

'Of course! After all, the NRA says it’s the safest place for kids,' Milhouse replies.

'They also say us kids should sleep under a blanket made of loaded guns. You know - for safety,' Bart says.

Satire: The game's jokes have been deemed boorish by some gamers

'I eat my cereal every morning with a gun instead of a spoon. Because more guns everywhere means safer kids. Thanks, NRA!' says Milhouse.

Police Chief Wiggum: 'I’d like to purchase this AK-47, please. Will you need to run a background check on me?'

Herman: 'Of course not. That would infringe on your Constitutional right to never be inconvenienced - even in the tiniest, most reasonable way - when guns are involved.'Wiggum to Apu: 'You do realize it’s now illegal to operate a store that doesn’t sell firearms? It’s all part of the “How Else May We Serve, Oh Wise and Powerful NRA?” Act. You’re going to jail!'

The Simpsons has long used satire as a
 means to ridicule elements of society, and it's certainly not the first
 time the show's creators have had their characters comment on guns.

The
 episode Cartridge Family, during which Homer eventually realizes his 
folly in buying a gun to protect his family, contains lines such as 'I 
don't have to be careful. I have a gun', and this exchange:

Homer: 'I'd like your deadliest gun please.'
Clerk: 'Aisle 6 - Next to the sympathy cards'

The
 show has been more evenhanded than the game appears to be, though: in 
that episode, Homer was ejected from the NRA for not following gun 
safety rules.

The show: In the episode Cartridge Family, Homer acquires a gun

The satire on the show is often 
slightly more subtle than that in level 30 of Tapped Out, which is loud 
and clear about current gun laws.

The 
accusation of 'hidden messages' implies there's something secretive or 
underhand, or even subliminal in the game's handling of gun issues, 
which couldn't be more off-target. 

Comments about the game on a post on TheTruthAboutGuns.com called 'The Simpsons: Tapped Out Game is Anti-NRA. Very Anti-NRA' express unhappiness with the game's treatment of the NRA.

all things that are upright & decent[?] They are condecending (sic) 
of churches, as an example, blapheming (sic) even the almighty God. I 
stopped watching this show a long time ago. I’m sorry I ever did to 
begin with.'

Ralph wrote, 
'The only gun owners I’m afraid of are so-called “adults” who watch 
cartoons. C’mon, people. They’re cartoons. They’re supposed to be 
stupid.'

Level 30: Herman's Military Antiques is the setting for the game's contentious gun statements

Issues: The Simpsons cartoon has always addressed issues in a light-hearted satirical way, without pushing any agenda - unlike level 30 of Tapped Out

It's not known how
 much involvement the creators of The Simpsons had with the game, if 
any. A forum on the EA site set up for the game has players pondering 
the out-of-character indelicacy of the level.

'[Is anyone
 surprised] at how political this new questline is? The Simpsons, when 
political, has always seemed gently so, but this is pretty rough stuff. 
Not surprised the writers feel this way, just surprised to see it so 
nakedly displayed in the game,' wrote shaygitz.

According to TheBlaze.com, the game's makers never expected gamers would play long enough to get to level 30.

'Sorry about level 30, guys. If you promise not to gripe to EA too much,
 everybody can have three donuts,' Wiggum tells players at the end of level 30.
