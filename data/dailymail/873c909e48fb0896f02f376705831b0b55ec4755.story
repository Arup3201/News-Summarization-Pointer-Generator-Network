Researchers have found all manner of nasties lurking between the buttons of hotel remote controls.

Scientists from the Today programme's Rossen Reports investigated hotel rooms at five major hotel chains in the US after housekeeping had finished cleaning them. 

Filthy: In every room they tested, scientists found sky-high levels of bacteria

Using an ultraviolet backlight to show up dirt unseen by the human eye, they uncovered suspicious stains throughout the room, such as on a sofa and a curtain.  

The researchers used a special meter which provided readouts of the bacteria counts - areas which scored over 100 on the scale, were seen as having an unacceptable level of bacteria.

The telephones were found to contain double  acceptable limit. 

But the remote controls had levels of up to 498 - which was the highest bacteria reading they measured.

Hotel telephones were found to be teeming with over double  the acceptable amount of bacteria 

Further laboratory testing even revealed traces of  E.coli in one remote control. Another remote was even harbouring the highly contagious MSRA bacterium, which is resistant to antibiotics. 

Bacteria expert Dr. Luisa Ikner, a microbiologist at the University of Arizona Gerba Laboratory, said: 'This indicates there was fecal contamination on the remote.

'So perhaps someone used the restroom and didn't wash their hands when they were done.'

Meanwhile, the cleanest areas in the rooms were found to be the light switches, which had readings as low as 6, and the alarm clocks and nightstands.  

The experts suggested that hotel guests  protect themselves from bacteria by washing their hands, using hand sanitizer and wiping down surfaces with a disinfectant wipe.

The findings come after a previous study, led by Katie Kirsch, an undergraduate student at the University of Houston, and colleagues from the University of South Carolina, tested for levels of total aerobic bacteria and fecal bacteria in hotel rooms across America.

They found that the dirtiest surfaces were bathroom sinks and floors as well as TV remote controls.

Surfaces with the lowest level of contamination were headboards, curtain rods and bathroom door handles.
