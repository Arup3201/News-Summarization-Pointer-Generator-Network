The bitter war of words between Valerie Trierweiler and Francois Hollande continued today as she said hearing about his affair felt like ‘falling from a skyscraper’. 

He, meanwhile, is said to have joked about her histrionic language, suggesting that any of his staff who were moved by her emotional claims should leave the Elysee Palace.

It was on Saturday that the President of France effectively sacked his first lady with a curt 18 word statement.

After packing her bags and leaving the presidential palace in Paris she tweeted: ‘All my gratitude to the extraordinary Elysee staff. I will never forget their devotion nor emotion at the point of departure.’

According to today’s Canard Enchaine, the investigative weekly, Hollande said: ‘If there are people who wish to leave the Elysee overcome by emotion, they should tell me over the next few days.’

The Canard, which has outstanding contacts in the Elysee, also made it clear that Mr Hollande is ‘not particularly fond’ of his ex-lover at the moment.

In an operation compared to the kind which went on in Soviet Russia, the Socialist president’s staff have now completely eradicated some 130 images of Ms Trierweiler from the official Elysee website, along with all other references to her.

She, meanwhile, is on the front cover of the latest Paris Match – the glossy weekly where she remains on staff.

The headline reads: ‘Valerie Trierweiler speaks to Match: "When I knew, I felt like I was falling from a skyscraper" '.

Ms
 Trierweiler has already spent a great deal of time telling journalists 
about her reaction to Mr Hollande’s two year affair with the actress 
Julie Gayet, 41.

She 
first said it was ‘like being hit by a high speed train’ and checked 
herself into a public hospital for eight days suffering from stress. 

Then, on a charity trip to India, she blamed 'low blows', 'betrayals' and 'back-stabbing' for the break-up.

Despite
 all this, Trierweiler said she will not be returning to the 'cynicism' 
of political journalism, and instead plans to launch a career as a 
humanitarian campaigner.

She wants to be a Princess Diana style ‘Queen of Hearts’ who travels the world helping the poor and the sick.

However,
 she has been widely mocked in France for travelling around Mumbai in a 
chauffeur driven limousine while staying in the five star Taj Palace 
Hotel.

Mr Hollande, who
 had never married, is now expected to remain a ‘bachelor president’ for
 a while, while continuing with his relationship with Ms Gayet outside 
the Elysee.

Ms Gayet 
has not spoken since the pictures were published of Mr Hollande leaving 
their Paris love nest on the back of a moped, while using a crash helmet
 as a poor disguise.
