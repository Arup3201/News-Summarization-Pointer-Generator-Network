Invisible to the naked eye, and smaller than a grain of sand, this etching of a Formula 1 car is so tiny it fits onto the front of a razor blade that is thinner than a beam of light.

Experts used a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an electron column and needle to make the miniature engraving.

The result is an image that is just 250 micrometres by 700 micrometres in size (0.25mm by 0.7mm).

Experts used a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an electron column and a needle to make the miniature engraving of the car (pictured). The result is an image that is just 250 micrometres by 700 micrometres in size - a quarter of a millimetre. The average grain of sand is around 1mm in diameter

By comparison, the average grain of sand is around 1mm in diameter. 

SEMs are typically used to inspect specimens in  labs. The SEM uses an electron beam to trace over the specimen, while creating an digital replica on a screen. 

This digital version is a 3D image that can be manipulated. 

As the electron beam traces over the object, it hits the surface and sends secondary electrons from this surface into unique patterns.

As the electron beam traces over the object, it hits the surface and sends secondary electrons from this surface into unique patterns. 

A secondary electron detector attracts those scattered electrons and, depending on the number of electrons that reach the detector, registers different levels of brightness on a monitor. 

These patterns and images can be used to learn about the surface topography and composition.

These patterns and images can then be used to learn about the surface topography and composition. 

The electon beam itself is controlled by a microscope, and the SEM creates a magnetic field using a scanning coil. 

By changing the voltage, experts are able to manipulate the strength and position of the beam. 

In this case, they used this to control the movement of the needle.  

The nanoscientists from Geneva-based Gillette worked with McLaren Mercedes on the project, and the car featured on the blade is the MP4-29. 

The autographs of F1 drivers Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen were also etched onto the surface. 

The team spent around 25 to 30 hours trying various different designs, sizes and ratios, to get the precise final result.

Dr Christopher Parmenter, research officer in Cryogenic Electron Microscopy from the University of Nottingham was involved in the project. 

He said: 'This was a unique project because it was the first time I had ever tried to engrave a signature, or a Formula 1 car.

'I’ve never engraved a razor blade before.

'The technology used is a feat of precision technology, so we’re dealing with images that are typically 250 micrometres, to 700 micrometres - that’s a quarter of a millimetre.

'It’s been challenging, but it’s a real achievement of 21st century technology.'

The engravings were made to demonstrate the precision engineering used by both brands, and five Gilette razors will be framed and given to fans. 

Its release also coincides with the final grand prix of the season in Abu Dhabi this weekend.

Gillette and McLaren will now apply to Guinness World Records to measure the engraving on the razor (pictured). Gillette currently holds the record for the world's smallest advert, which measured 100 microns and was etched into a whisker. This record was set in 2011 and used similar technology

Jenson Button said: 'The role of a racing driver is the management of high-precision performance - in a grand prix, finding the last millimetre on the track or the final thousandth of a second of laptime sometimes counts the most.

'And when you spend so much time chasing those tiny fractions, you can become obsessed with them. 

The results are really incredible.'
