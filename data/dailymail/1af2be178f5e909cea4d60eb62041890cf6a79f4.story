While many moons show signs of their age, with pockmarked surface and craters, Titan manages to retain its youthful looks - are researcher have finally found out the secret behind its youthful appearance.

The secret to eternal youth, they found is simple - sand.

Dunes of exotic, hydrocarbon sand are 
slowly but steadily filling in its craters, according to new research 
using observations from NASA's Cassini spacecraft.

Images from the Cassini spacecraft show a 'fresh' crater called Sinlap (left) and an extremely degraded crater called Soi (right) that has been filled in by sand. These craters are both about 50 miles (80 kilometers) in diameter

Titan is the only moon in the solar 
system with a thick atmosphere, and the only world besides Earth known 
to have lakes and seas on its surface.

However, Titan has a frigid 
surface temperature of around minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit (94 kelvins).

The rain that falls from Titan's skies is not water, but contains 
liquid methane and ethane, compounds that are gases at Earth's 
temperatures.

'Most of the Saturnian satellites - Titan's siblings - have thousands and thousands of craters on their surface,'  said Catherine Neish, a Cassini radar team associate based at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.

'So far on Titan, of the 50 percent of the surface that we've seen in high resolution, we've only found about 60 craters,' she said.

'It's possible that there are many more craters on Titan, but they are not visible from space because they are so eroded.

'We typically estimate the age of a planet's surface by counting the number of craters on it (more craters means an older surface).

'But if processes like stream erosion or drifting sand dunes are filling them in, it's possible that the surface is much older that it appears.

'This research is the first quantitative estimate of how much the weather on Titan has modified its surface,'adds Neish.

Neish and her team compared craters on Titan to craters on Jupiter's moon Ganymede. Ganymede is a giant moon with a water ice crust, similar to Titan, so craters on the two moons should have similar shapes.

However, Ganymede has almost no atmosphere and thus no wind or rain to erode its surface.

'We found that craters on Titan were on average hundreds of yards shallower than similarly sized craters on Ganymede, suggesting that some process on Titan is filling its craters,' said Neish, who is lead author of a paper about this research published online in the journal Icarus.

Titan's atmosphere is mostly nitrogen with a trace of methane and other, more complex molecules made of hydrogen and carbon (hydrocarbons).

The source of Titan's methane remains a mystery.

'Since the sand appears to be produced from the atmospheric methane, Titan must have had methane in its atmosphere for at least several hundred million years in order to fill craters to the levels we are seeing," says Neish.

However, researchers estimate Titan's current supply of methane should be broken down by sunlight within tens of millions of years, so Titan either had a lot more methane in the past, or it is being replenished somehow.

'The presence of liquids on the surface and in the near subsurface can also cause extensive modification to crater shape, as is observed on Earth,' says Neish.
