A woman has been charged and is due to appear in court over the death of a ten-month-old baby girl.

Little Chloe Sutherland was rushed to hospital after police were called to a house in the Sighthill area of Edinburgh out of concern for the child's welfare.

Doctors at the city's Royal Hospital for Sick Children had battled to save her life following what police have only described as an 'incident' at the house yesterday afternoon, but she died shortly before midnight.

A 35-year-old woman has been charged in connection with Chloe's death, and will appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court tomorrow.

Chloe's family, including her father Craig Steedman who is an accounts manager for Scottish Gas, today issued a statement paying tribute to the 'beautiful' little girl.  

'Chloe was a beautiful and vibrant little girl who had everything to live for and who sadly passed away peacefully with her daddy and family at her side,' they said in a statement issued by police.

'Chloe was much loved by her brother and sister and her family and friends and will be sadly missed by all of us.

'We would ask that our privacy be respected at what is a very difficult time.' 

Stunned neighbours in the close-knit community today paid tribute to baby Chloe following the 'shocking' news of her death.

Next door neighbour Peter Roach said: 'Chloe was a very happy 10-month-old baby.

'They were just normal working class people. I think it's already affected the street. There were people out this morning taking their kids to school and nursery and everyone was very quiet and sad looking.

'It's a close knit street and usually quiet. It's a shock. The area has a bad name but this is a nice quiet street.'

Her daughter Lisa Alexander, 22, said: 'They seemed very normal. Just a normal family. I didn't know them that well but its very sad news.'

Rahman Afzal, who runs a nearby shop, said: 'They came to my shop almost every day.
