The family of black teenager Tony Robinson, who was shot and killed by a white police officer on Friday, have demanded justice in the wake of his tragic death, while court documents have revealed the health problems he was experiencing.

A report by the Wisconsin Department of Corrections suggests the 19-year-old was an impulsive risk-taker who had ADD and experienced anxiety and depression.

It stated the teenager also faced a choice between a middle-class lifestyle and that of a gangster after being exposed to a 'chaotic' family situation.

The revelations were announced as close to 2,000 students marched in Wisconsin's capital to protest the fatal police shooting, while the police chief apologized. 

Students crowded into the rotunda of the state Capitol in the morning, chanting, waving signs and demanding justice.

Demanding justice: Demonstrators protest the shooting of Tony Robinson at the state Capitol in Wisconsin on Monday. The 19-year-old was gunned down by a white police officer in Madison on Friday 

Symbolic: Students held up signs saying 'Hands Up, Don't Shoot' and raised their hands into the air as they stood on the rotunda of the building 

Deadly incident: Robinson, 19, was shot by officer Matt Kenny at an apartment in Madison, Wisconsin, on Friday evening. The teenager's family have demanded that a full investigation be launched into his death 

Madison police officer Matt Kenny shot Robinson on Friday evening while investigating a call that the young man was jumping in and out of traffic and had assaulted someone. 

Turin Carter, Robinson's uncle, said his family was calling for a thorough investigation and was concerned about the 'systematic targeting of young black males,' but did not endorse blanket anti-police sentiments.

'We are not proponents of anti-police (attitudes)... We understand that law enforcement is necessary and mandatory and we need to change our mindset about the police,' Carter said at a news conference outside the house where Robinson was shot.

Standing near a memorial of candles and balloons, Carter said it was simplistic to call Robinson African American, saying he had a mixed heritage and his racial ambiguity was a central issue in his life. 

Many teenagers at the morning protests were from Robinson's alma mater, Sun Prairie High School.

'There is an indifference between people and police. We all need to come together,' said Ali Asafford, 15, after leaving class at Madison's East High School. The march was orderly and police presence was minimal.

Plea: Turin Carter, Tony Robinson's uncle, tells the media there should be a thorough investigation into his nephew's death and is concerned about the 'systematic targeting of young black males,

Issues: Court documents revealed that Robinson suffered from mental health problems - such as anxiety and depression - and had a choice between a middle-class lifestyle and that of a gangster

Gesture: Demonstrators raise their fists in unison inside the government building. Earlier on Monday the Madison police chief apologized for the deadly shooting 

Officer Matt Kenny, the 12-year police veteran who shot Robinson, is on paid administrative leave while the Wisconsin Department of Justice investigates the shooting. In 2007, Kenny was involved in a fatal shooting that was found to be justified.

Police Chief Michael Koval apologized on Monday after praying with Robinson's grandmother over the weekend and pledging transparency in the investigation.

'Reconciliation cannot begin without my stating 'I am sorry,' and I don't think I can say this enough. I am sorry. I hope that, with time, Tony's family and friends can search their hearts to render some measure of forgiveness,' Koval wrote in his blog.

Attorney General Brad Schimel asked the public to be patient with the investigation, saying his office would not be able to disclose details since it could taint testimony from witnesses.

Gathering: Madison Mayor Paul Soglin addresses a crowd of protestors on Martin Luther King Boulevard. Around 2,000 students descended on the city to protest the teenager's death on Monday

Official efforts to be transparent, apologetic and light-handed with protesters followed months of heightened attention to police use of deadly force across the United States.

Last year, the police shooting death of black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, set off weeks of protests that sometimes turned violent. Police reaction was criticized as heavy-handed, and critics were outraged at the long delay in releasing the name of the officer who shot Brown.

Madison, a city of 240,000 people about 80 miles (130 km) west of Milwaukee, has a mostly white population. The city is 7 percent African-American, U.S. Census figures show. 

Last year, Robinson pleaded guilty to armed robbery, and was placed on probation. Sentencing documents show it was his first brush with the law, and he was not the armed person in the group that committed the robbery.

Heartfelt note: Most of the protesters who had walked out of their classrooms. One had scrawled a message on a lamppost 

The robbery case file includes a letter from Robinson's grandmother, Sharon Irwin, to the judge. In it, she asks for her grandson to be sentenced to probation, saying he was just following his co-defendants' lead.

Robinson 'is a great kid in between being a teen and a man,' she wrote. 'That is one of his issues. Impulsive. The other is being a follower.'

His aunt, Loren Carter, wrote a note to the judge asking for mercy in sentencing. She said Robinson grew up poor without his father but was kind-hearted and intelligent.

Robinson's defense attorney, Michael J. Short, wrote to the judge that Robinson had taken special-education classes and had never been in trouble with the law before.

Studensts and some adults stood arm-in-arm as they made their way down the streets 

'He was an easy choice for the seasoned co-defendants to manipulate into participation,' Short wrote. 'He did not give any orders but just followed the instructions meted out by the other defendants.'

Keith Wessel, a Madison family law attorney who said he was married to Robinson's grandmother for a time, wrote to Short in September and told him that he raised two of Robinson's uncles and knew Robinson from birth.

Wessel wrote that some branches of Robinson's family exposed him to a 'chaotic environment.' He did not elaborate but said Robinson faced a choice between a middle-class life and the 'gangsta' path. He warned if Robinson went to prison on a felony charge he would continue toward the gangster world.

He said Monday he was shocked at the shooting. He said Robinson stood 6-foot-5 but was a 'teddy bear.'

Remembrance: A memorial for the teenager was set up outside the apartment where he was shot. It has gradually built up with flowers and tributes 

Laid down: Flowers, balloons and candles line the road near the location where officer Matt Kenny gunned down Robinson on Friday

Emotional: Destiny Marshall of Atlanta, Georgia, is consoled by friends during a protest

'I can't imagine Tony is going to fight a cop breaking into his house,' Wessel said. 'I just don't see that as likely ... I really think we need to examine our police policies.'

Concern about Wisconsin's own history of police use of deadly force prompted passage of a law last year requiring independent investigators to probe such incidents. The bill had support from police associations.

The head of the local NAACP chapter said the Madison police department did not engage in the sort of racial targeting that the U.S. Justice Department found prevalent in Ferguson.

'I have observed what I think is a very effective community policing structure, and I think it makes a difference,' said Greg Jones, president of the Dane County chapter of the advocacy group.
