The widow of the suspected Boston bomber enjoyed a fast food lunch on Sunday as federal officials once again searched her home to determine whether she had any involvement in the deadly terrorist attacks.

Katherine Russell, 24, laughed and chatted with a friend at a branch of the Mexican fast-food chain Chipotle along with her three-year-old daughter.

She appeared relaxed and carefree as she ordered at the counter before carrying a soda and bag of food to her car from the restaurant close to her home in Warwick, Rhode Island. The widow was likely trailed by undercover FBI agents in an unmarked car as officials remain suspicious about how much she knows relating to the planning and production of the pressure cooker bombs.

The casual outing came as federal investigators revealed that they had discovered radical Islamist materials on a computer belonging to Russell and the fact that she will not reveal what she spoke to her husband about when they had a phone conversation on the night that his photo was released by the FBI.

Agents were back at her home Sunday, as investigators in hazmat suits looked through her home, CNN reported.

They stopped searching in the afternoon and it was not immediately clear if they took anything from the home.

Russell has repeatedly claimed through her
 attorney that she knew nothing about the deadly April 15 bombings 
allegedly set off by her late husband, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, and his 
younger brother, Dzhokhar.

However,
 the discovery of al Qaeda’s Inspire magazine on Russell’s computer, 
along with the presence of explosive residue throughout their home, have
 raised new questions about Russell's possible involvement in the act of
 terror.

According to a government document obtained by NBC News, an analysis of the bombs used at the Boston Marathon and pipe bombs that the Tsarnaevs had allegedly thrown at police may have been built following instructions that appeared in an Inspire article titled: Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom.

Officials have yet to determine whether the Islamist files found in Russell’s possession belonged to the 24-year-old mother, her late 26-year-old husband or a third party, a source told The Washington Post.

Tamerlan Tsranaev was shot dead in a gun battle with police four days after the marathon bombings when he and his brother allegedly carjacked a vehicle in a Boston suburb.

His younger brother, 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, had fled, setting off a massive manhunt that ended when he was discovered gravely wounded hiding in a boat.

Russell's attorney, Amato DeLuca, had previously said his client was kept in the dark about the deadly plot, and she was shocked to learn that her husband and brother-in-law were allegedly responsible for the attacks.

Meanwhile, CNN reported that 
investigators inspecting Russell and Tsranaev's home in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts, found traces of explosive residue in the kitchen sink, 
the bathtub and on a table.

Following
 his arrest, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told police that he and his older brother
 built the pressure cooker bombs in the basement of the Cambridge 
residence.

'Incriminating': Officials say among the materials discovered on Russell's computer was al Qaeda's Inspire magazine

It was 
established earlier this week that female DNA found one a piece of an 
explosive device used in the attacks did not match Russell's, but rather
 belonged to a department store clerk where the siblings had purchased 
the pressure cookers.

In 
another development in the case, federal and state law enforcement 
officials accompanied by bomb-sniffing dogs scoured a wooded area near 
Dartmouth, Massachusetts, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev attended college, in 
search of new evidence possibly related to the attacks.

According to witness accounts, the brothers may have tested explosives in the woods two weeks before the bombings

It was revealed earlier this week that Tamerlan Tsarnaev called his wife in the hours after the FBI released surveillance images of him and his younger brother.

But only Russell knows what was said in the conversation, as she has stopped cooperating with authorities over recent days, the New York Times reported.

Authorities are skeptical of her 
insistence that she played no role in the attack or in helping the 
brothers escape the authorities following the release of the 
photographs, the Times reported.

A source told CNN that the bombs were built in the apartment that Tsarnaev shared with Russell and their three-year-old daughter. Residue samples were found on the kitchen table, the kitchen sink, and the bathtub, the source said.

Spokesman Jason Pack confirmed that 
agents investigating the Boston bombings visited the North Kingstown 
home of Russell's parents, where Tsarnaev's widow has been staying since
 the attacks.

Her lawyer says Russell denies any 
involvement in the bombings, but authorities are still working to 
establish what exactly she knew - if anything - before or after the 
April 15 attacks.

On Wednesday, attorney Amato 
DeLuca insisted Russell 'will continue to meet with law enforcement, as
 she has done for many hours over the past week, and provide as much 
assistance to the investigation as she can' though said cooperation has apparently ended with no explanation.

Russell met Tamerlan while she was a student at Suffolk University, according to her lawyer. She converted to Islam and they married in 2010 before having a daughter, now three.

Her husband was killed on April 18 following a shoot out with police in Watertown. Investigators say his younger brother hit him with a car as he fled the scene.

Body: A vehicle believed to be carrying Tsarnaev's body backs into an underground garage at the Dyer-Lake Funeral Home in North Attleborough, Massachusetts. His family claimed his body on Thursday

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was caught the following day as he was found hiding in a boat in a backyard.

Russell, who has been living with her 
parents in North Kingstown, Rhode Island, learned this week that the medical 
examiner was ready to release his body and wanted it released to his family.

Department of Public Safety spokesman Terrel Harris said a funeral home 
retained by Tsarnaev's family picked up the remains. He 
said he had no more information about plans for the body.

Tsarnaev's uncle Ruslan Tsarni, of Maryland, said Tuesday night the family would take the body.

Changed: Russell, pictured left in high school and right following the bombings, met Tamerlan while she was a college student but dropped out when she fell pregnant. She converted to Islam for him

'Of course, family members will take possession of the body,' Tsarni said. 'We'll do it. We will do it. A family is a family.'

The April 15 bombing, using pressure cookers packed with explosives, 
nails, ball bearings and metal shards near the marathon's finish line, 
killed three people and injured more than 180 others.

Russell's attorneys have previously said she and her family were in shock when
 they learned of the allegations against her husband and brother-in-law,
 Dzhokhar.
