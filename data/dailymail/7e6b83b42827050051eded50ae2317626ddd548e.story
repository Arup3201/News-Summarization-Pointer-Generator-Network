Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific Airways has been announced as the winner of the Airline of the Year 2014 award.

The airline received the top honor as part of Skytrax's World Airline Awards.

The prize was presented at the Farnborough International Airshow by CNN correspondent Jim Boulden.

'Of all the sellers, Cathay were the best performer across all types of travel,' Skytrax's CEO Edward Plaisted said to CNN. 'Some airliners were very good in economy, others in luxury, but [Cathay Pacific Airways was] top or near the top in all categories,' he said.

'The Worldâ€™s Best Airline award is 
particularly important to us because it was decided by the votes of 
close to 19 million travellers from around the world. Thank you to 
everyone who voted for us!' Cathay Pacific Chief Executive Ivan Chu said in a release.

Chu also said the company 'will not rest on [its] laurels.'

'We will continue working to provide a superior travel experience that will make the people of Hong Kong proud,' he said.

Qatar Airways took second place in Skytrax's Airline of the Year list. Singapore Airlines, Emirates, and Turkish Airlines came in third, fourth, and fifth, respectively.

ANA All Nippon Airways, Garuda Indonesia, Asiana Airlines, Etihad Airways and Lufthansa rounded out the top ten in descending order.

American airlines were also outperformed by both Air Canada and WestJet in SkyTrax's list of Best Airlines in North America.

Air Canada ranked number one in that list, followed by WestJet and Virgin America.

They were followed by Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Porter Airlines, jetBlue Airways, Alaska Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and American Eagle Airlines, respectively.

Similarly, the US didn't make it into Skytrax's Best Airports in the World 2014 list, which was published earlier this year.

Singapore Changi Airport took the number-one spot in that list. The only North American airport to be included was Vancouver International Airport, ranked at number nine.

Requests for comment to Skytrax and Cathay Pacific Airways from MailOnline were not immediately returned.
