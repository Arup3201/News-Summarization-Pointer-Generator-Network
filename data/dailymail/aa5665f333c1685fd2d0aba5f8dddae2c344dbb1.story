These days he prefers not to discuss his love of deerstalking.

But David Cameron still treats pigeons as fair game – and has taken a 12-bore shotgun out to hunt them near his home, it has been claimed.

The Prime Minister even asked Scotland Yard protection officers to seal off woodland in Oxfordshire while he took aim, according to a startling disclosure.

The Tory leader is said to have targeted pigeons because he ‘missed’ the days when he could shoot deer in Scotland.

Last night animal rights groups reacted furiously to the claims, accusing the PM of killing animals for ‘sheer pleasure’.

Mr Cameron is said to be an expert deerstalker and has spoken openly in the past about his fondness for country pursuits including foxhunting and shooting.

But since becoming Prime Minister, he has been less keen to talk about his love of field sports. Yet when he was missing the days when he could go deerstalking at his father-in-law’s Scottish estate, he went out to shoot pigeons in the woods, according to the newly published diaries of The Telegraph’s Scottish Editor Alan Cochrane.

Mr Cochrane, who met the Prime Minister for dinner in Fife in February 2012 during the long run-up to the independence referendum, wrote in his diary: ‘As we ate venison, DC moaned about the fact that he couldn’t go deerstalking any more.

‘I suppose he doesn’t want to hark back to the grouse moor-image days of Harold Macmillan, or to be seen out with a rifle.

‘DC says that recently he fancied a bit of shooting, so took his 12-bore out into a wood near his home and bagged a couple of pigeons. It must have been quite a sight – the wood had to be surrounded by coppers with guns. Whether that was to protect the ramblers from the PM or the PM from the ramblers wasn’t clear.

‘Anyway, he misses shooting/killing things.’

Asked if the Prime Minister owned a 12-bore shotgun, both Downing Street and Scotland Yard declined to comment.

Andrew Tyler, of campaign group Animal Aid, said: ‘This is killing animals for the sheer pleasure of exterminating their lives. Normally these activities are wrapped up in justifications to do with conserving species, or boosting the rural economy, or species management.

‘What makes it all the more nauseating is that he hasn’t got the guts to do it openly, because he knows what the political fall-out would be. He is trying to distance himself from the “posh boy” image.’ Yesterday Mr Cameron’s neighbours in Oxfordshire said they had not seen the PM carrying a shotgun in woodland near his home.

One woman, who asked not to be named, said: ‘I have never seen him with a gun under his arm. You do hear shots going off from time to time but I think that is mainly the organised shoots.’ Another neighbour added: ‘So what if he does?’

Political commentator Bruce Anderson has described Mr Cameron as an ‘excellent shot’. He said: ‘Shooting is a form of complete relaxation, and if you are Prime Minister, and want to switch off, it is perfect.’

The PM was a regular deerstalker – where stags are tracked and then shot – and is reputedly one of the few marksmen skilled enough to shoot two beasts in one go using the so-called ‘right left’ technique.

He used to hunt at the 20,000-acre Tarbert estate on the Scottish island of Jura owned by his wife Samantha’s stepfather Viscount Astor.

He insisted he had not given up the sport because of objections from animal rights campaigners, saying it was the most ‘defensible’ field sport because it kept the deer numbers under control.

In a BBC radio interview before becoming PM, Mr Cameron revealed he was taught to shoot rabbits by his father and said he had ‘always been a country boy’. Last year, he dodged a question about hunting by saying he would now ‘rather go for a walk’.

The Tories pledged to give the Commons a free vote on repealing Labour’s ban on foxhunting – which Mr Cameron also used to enjoy – but it was unofficially shelved in 2011.
