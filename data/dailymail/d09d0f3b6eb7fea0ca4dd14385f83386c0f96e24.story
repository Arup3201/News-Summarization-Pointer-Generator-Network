A powerful typhoon is wreaking havoc across Japan having already killed at least five people as it approaches the country's tsunami-ravaged northeastern coast and the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant. 

Typhoon Roke has already lashed Tokyo halting trains and stranding tens of thousands of commuters as it barreled northwards.

Police and local media reported that six people were dead or missing after being swept away by rivers swollen with rains from the typhoon.

Nearly 260,000 households in central Japan were without electricity, and authorities called for more than a million people to be evacuated in central and eastern Japan.

The storm, packing sustained winds of up to 90 mph hit the country near the city of Hamamatsu, about 125 miles west of Tokyo.

Its projected coursewill take it near the damaged Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, where a small amount of radiation is still leaking after three of its reactors melted down when the tsunami cut off power to the plant and its back-up generators.

Takeo Iwamoto, spokesman for Tokyo Electric Power Co., the utility that operates the plant, said the cooling system for the reactors, crucial to keeping them under control, will not be endangered by the typhoon.

He said some construction work around the plant was canceled and utmost efforts were under way to prevent leaks of radioactive water and other material from the typhoon.

The center of the fast-moving storm is 
now heading towards the northeastern region of Tohoku devastated by the 
March 11 tsunami and earthquake.

Fire department officials reported three 
people were injured in Tokyo. In the trendy shopping district of 
Shibuya, winds knocked over a tree onto a sidewalk, but no one was hurt.

Television footage showed pedestrians struggling to walk straight in powerful winds that made umbrellas useless.

The Fire and Disaster Management 
Agency said just over one million people have been ordered or advised to
evacuate across the country due to fear of flooding or mudslides 
triggered by the typhoon.

The
city of Nagoya temporarily called off an evacuation warning for 880,000
people when swelling in a major river subsided, but officials said the 
warning could be reissued if conditions warranted.

Heavy rains caused floods and road damage in dozens of locations in Nagoya and several other cities, the Aichi prefectural (state) government said. Parts of Japan's central city of Nagoya, about 170 miles west of Tokyo, were flooded near swollen rivers where rescue workers helped residents evacuate in rubber boats.

Police in nearby Gifu prefecture said a
nine-year-old boy and an 84-year-old man were missing after apparently 
falling into swollen rivers.

More than 200 domestic flights were canceled and some bullet train services were suspended.

Toyota
Motor Corp., Japan's No. 1 automaker, which is headquartered in Toyota 
city in Aichi, was shutting plants as a precaution.

Nissan Motor Co. spokesman Chris Keeffe said workers at its Yokohama headquarters and nearby technical facilities were being told to go home early for safety reasons, and two plants were not operating.

A typhoon that slammed Japan earlier this month left about 90 people dead or missing.
