A Michigan man has been found guilty of killing his girlfriend’s 1-year-old daughter who authorities say had bleeding in her brain and eyes, as well as alcohol and marijuana in her system.

A Kalamazoo jury convicted Toren Hains, 22, Tuesday of felony murder and first-degree child abuse in the December 2012 death of Zoie Grace Johnston, of Oshtemo Township.

Hains’ murder conviction comes with mandatory life imprisonment.

Guilty: Toren Hains, 22 (left), was convicted of felony murder and child abuse in the death of his girlfriend's 14-month-old daughter, Zoie Johnston, (right) who passed away from head trauma on New Year's Eve 2012

Officials say the 22-year-old was babysitting Zoie and was the boyfriend of the child's mother, Bailea Johnston.

An autopsy performed on the toddler’s body determined the cause of death to be head trauma, Kalamazoo Gazette reported.

Hains testified last week that he did not hurt Zoie and she suffered a seizure after falling from his arms. 

However, a pathologist told the jury the condition of the victim’s body was consistent with violent shaking or being struck.

Baby Zoie was declared brain dead at Bronson Methodist Hospital on December 31, 2012.

Her death was ruled a homicide caused by head trauma. Tests showed that the one-year-old had marijuana in her system and a blood-alcohol level of 0.087 - the equivalent of three drinks consumed by a grownup woman weighing 175lbs.

Prosecutors said Hains, pictured here May 2, gave the toddler pot brownies and vodka before shaking or striking her to death

According to the prosecution, the toddler suffered fatal injuries December 30, 2012, while she was left in the care of her mother's live-in boyfriend, Toren Haines, at their apartment on South 11th Street in Oshtemo Township.

During his murder trial, which got under way April 30, Hains testified that he did nothing to harm Bailea Johnston's daughter while she was at work that night.

Hains told the jurors that he was holding Zoie in his arms and doing laundry when the child fell to the floor and suffered a seizure.

But Dr John Bachniski, a pathologist from Sparrow Hospital, testified that the amount of trauma Zoie suffered pointed to a violent shaking and having been struck against a soft object.

According to police, Hains took the unresponsive Zoie to a neighbor's apartment the night she was injured and asked him not to call 911.

His version: Hains testified that he was holding Zoie in his arms when she fell and suffered a seizure

A Kalamazoo County sheriff's deputy testified that the night before the toddler’s death, Hains made a batch of pot brownies, lacing the baked goods with a bag of marijuana ‘the size of about a potato.’

The 22-year-old then allegedly fed baby Zoie some of the brownies, and also gave her a flavored drink containing vodka.

‘At the end of this trial you may not care for the parenting skills, or lack thereof, of Toren Hains, his lifestyle -- marijuana brownies, etc. -- but he's not on trial for being a druggie, he's not on trial for not paying the best attention or being the best parent,’ his attorney Keith Turpel told jurors in his opening statement.
