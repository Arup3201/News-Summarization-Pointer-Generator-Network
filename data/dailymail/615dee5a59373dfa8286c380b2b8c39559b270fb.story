A Florida mother made the toughest decision a parent can make Friday when she turned her son into police for murdering his girlfriend.

Shortly after Khambrel Hadley, 21, confessed to murdering girlfriend, Alyssa Oakes, 19, and told her where he dumped the body, his mother called 911 to report the crime. The alleged murderer was arrested later that afternoon, according to reports.

The doomed couple had moved into a Delano, FL., apartment just two months ago.

Accused murderer: Khambrel Hadley allegedly confessed to murdering girlfriend Alyssa Oakes and dumping her body in a wooded area near a lake

Hadley’s getaway was foiled when a neighbour called 911 to report his car stolen, according to WFTV, it didn’t take long for cops to finger Hadley as the thief.

Oddly enough, Hadley had been hanging out with man who’s car he stole just the night before.

‘He was pulling out of the apartment complex when I saw him take off,’ the man told the station.

Police responded to Hadley’s mother’s 911 call by visiting the apartment he and Oakes shared, instead of finding the young woman, they found evidence of a struggle and what WESH called a ‘brutal’ murder.

Officials have yet to release details of the crime, or even an exact day of death.

Separately, investigators found the body of the beautiful young Oakes dumped in a wooded area near a lake about 30 miles south of where she was killed, according to multiple reports.

Neighbors of the couple told WFTV they often heard the young lovers fighting, and even saw Oakes' parents come to her aid more than once during the arguments.

'Her parents would come out here from time to time when they got in arguments,' a neighbor told WFTV.

A spokesperson for the apartment complex told the station that police responded to a domestic violence incident at the apartment only three weeks ago.

Around 5:30 Friday afternoon, cops spotted Hadley in Orlando and pursued him as he took off on foot, according to WFTV. He was arrested and booked on charges of second-degree murder,  resisting arrest and grand theft – for stealing his neighbor’s car.

He pleaded not guilty at arraignment Saturday and is currently being held in Orange County (FL) jail.
