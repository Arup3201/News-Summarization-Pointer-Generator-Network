From Michael Schumacher winning the Grand Prix to George Osborne at Margaret Thatcher's funeral - we all know big boys really can cry.

But a few tears over a bad batch of buns was a step too far for fans of the Great British Bake Off, as tears from two male contestants on Tuesday's show provoked a Twitter tirade accusing both of being a '#crybaby'.

First it was Glenn Cosby, the 46-year-old teacher from Teignmouth in Devon, who turned on the waterworks as he explained to the cameras after the disaster that was his almond and apricot brioches and sticky caramel kannelbullen that were so sticky they stuck to the tin.

But when Howard Middleton, 51, who was ditched by judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry - and the graphic designer-turned-coucil worker from Sheffield seized the chance to show off his own lip-wobbling skills.

Welling up: Glenn, left, has a sob to the cameras... but it was Howard's turn for tears when he was voted off

Far from seeing the sweet and syrupy side to the emotional end of episode six, viewers lashed out at the blubbing bakers, accusing them - and the show - of being overly sentimental.

Programmes such as ITV's The X Factor have already been slammed for relying too much on 'sob stories' in a poor attempt to stir viewers' emotions.

And the BBC Two cookery contest escaped none of the abuse last night, with James Cole joining in the Twitter tirade: 'Crying is for when we lose the Ryder Cup, not when you f*** up your buns on Great British Bake-Off.'

Rob Murphy tweeted; 'Big Glenn crying over his failed brioches on Great British Bake Off makes you realise what an easy life you lead. #hardship.'

Gaby Ireland wrote: 'Why are people crying on bake off? It's not life or death if you've burnt your cake!'

While Jack Pullein said: 'B***** hell great British bake off is turning into X Factor with all these sob stories.'

Others took a more tongue-in-cheek view of the whole spectacle, with Andrew Simmonds commenting: 'Only in the UK would people cry over slightly disappointingly baked goods.'

Though they were in a minority, one or two fans admitted that their own heartstrings had been tugged, with Phoebe Williams tweeting: 'Had to pretend to be texting so my mum wouldn't see that I was crying at Great British Bake Off.'

Break down: Glenn's brioches did not survive his attempts to bash them out the tin

During the show, Glenn produced a series of unimpressive bakes - his caramel kannelbull earning the put-down from Paul Hollywood: 'What you've actually got is a very, very sharp, sour-tasting cinnamon. It doesn't taste good - have you tried one of these yet?'

And when it came to his almond and apricot brioches, Paul said: 'Apricots have just been plonked on top like that. They look awful.'

Even Mary Berry had to concede of the kannelbull: 'Sadly this is something that really hasn't worked.'

Earlier, his signature bake - a 'Devonshire panettone' - was declared 'definitely underbaked'.

But even this could not compete with Howard's all-too experimental signature bake - a tea loaf flavoured with hemp.

And his 'peachy buns' that failed to taste of peach and Baumschnecken that were 'very dry' were the proverbial icing on the cake of his defeat.

Having treated us all to a good weep before the judging, Glenn would not let himself be upstaged by Howard's dramatic exit, as he turned the taps on again in the final moments of the show to choke: 'I feel terrible – it should have been me. So now I have to do it. I have to carry on and do well.'

And then came Howard. 'It’s been an absolutely fantastic experience and there are people in there who I have been very, very close to...' he sobbed.

'They are such fantastic bakers and I am dead chuffed that I was there with them.'
