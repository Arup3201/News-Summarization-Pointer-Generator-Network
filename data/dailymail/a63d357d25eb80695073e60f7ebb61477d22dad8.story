Daniel Sturridge believes his injury problems could possibly be 'hereditary' as he faces more weeks out of the Liverpool side with a calf strain.

The England striker hasn't played for club or country since the beginning of September and the Reds have dropped points in the Premier League without their focal point in attack.

And Sturridge, whose uncles Dean and Simon also played professional football while his father was a trainee at Birmingham, says his struggles can be put down to a Caribbean gene pool.

'I play my game as best I can, but I've been unfortunate this season,' Sturridge told talkSPORT. 'Maybe it's my body type, maybe it's hereditary.'

'Both my uncles had injuries, and my dad had them as well. Maybe it's the Caribbean vibes, maybe I have speed but maybe it makes you more vulnerable because of the fast twitch muscles and the speed in which you're moving.

'I am vulnerable to muscle injuries. As long as I continue to work hard everything will take care of itself.'

Mario Balotelli has filled in for the 25-year-old as Brendan Rodgers' side lie in seventh place in the Premier League.

The £16million summer arrival from AC Milan has yet to score in the Premier League and has brought his usual controversies back to England off the pitch, most notably swapping shirts with Pepe half-way through a 3-0 defeat to Real Madrid.

The England striker has backed team-mate Mario Balotelli and says they can form a partnership

However, Sturridge insists he doesn't have a bad word to say about the Italian and that once he returns, the duo can recreate a partnership similar to his and Luis Suarez's last season.

He added: 'We get on well off the field and in the changing rooms. We're always laughing and joking,'

'Once I get back fit I'm hoping we can strike up a partnership. Last season with Luis [Suarez] we had a great relationship up front and scored a lot of goals. Hopefully this season it will be the same.'

'He's a likeable person. I don't have any bad words to say about him. People don't realise what he's been through in his life to get where he is today.'
