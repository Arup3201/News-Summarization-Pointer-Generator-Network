The father of the three-year-old Cherokee girl at the center of a tug-of-war dispute turned himself in to authorities on Monday but refused extradition to South Carolina.

That's where Veronica's adoptive parents Matt and Melanie Capobianco live and where state authorities have finalized Veronica's adoption and charged Brown with 'custodial interference' for refusing to turn over the girl.

'This is my daughter,' Brown said, according to Anderson Cooper 360. 'It isn't a yoyo I borrowed for two years.'

Couple: Matt and Melanie Capobianco have been awarded custody of the girl they brought up from 2009

Brown posted $10,000 bond and was released at 11am Monday, according to Oklahoma's Sequoyah County Sheriff's Office.

Brown, a member of the Cherokee Nation, was charged over the weekend with custodial interference after failing to appear at a court-ordered meeting in South Carolina.

He's now refused extradition without a governor's warrant from South Carolina.

Brown's lawyer, Robert Nigh, said his client is caught between competing jurisdictions and is 'making every effort to do the right thing for himself and his daughter.' Nigh refused to say where Brown is currently. He's due in court again in 30 days.

The James Island, South Carolina parents, meanwhile, have been trying to adopt Veronica since her birth in 2009. after which they raised the girl for two years.

But Brown has had custody of his daughter since 2011, when South Carolina's Supreme Court ruled that a 1978 federal law written to ensure Native American children stay with Native American parents gave him preference over the Capobiancos.

In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the law does not apply in this case because the biological father never had custody of Veronica and abandoned her before birth.

Native American tribes across the U.S. see the case as a test of tribal sovereignty which could set a precedent for other adoptions

Veronica is in the care of her paternal grandparents and Dusten Brown's wife, Robin Brown.

Earlier Monday, the Capobiancos called on federal law enforcement to help them bring the child to South Carolina, saying they'll take the matter into their own hands if necessary.

'Send someone to the location our daughter is being held and work with us to bring her home. No more delays and no more excuses,' Matt Capobianco said during a news conference.

'Our daughter has been kidnapped, and I expect the situation to be treated as such.'

'I'm always going to be her daddy': Dusten Brown and daughter Veronica met for the first time on New Year's Eve 2011

Brown had never met his daughter and, after Veronica's non-Indian mother rebuffed his marriage proposal, played no role during the pregnancy and paid no child support after the girl was born.

The legal proceedings began when Brown found out Veronica was going to be adopted. He objected and said the Indian Child Welfare Act favored the girl living with him and growing up learning tribal traditions.

The Capobiancos appealed the South Carolina Supreme Court's 2011 decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, and it ruled in June that South Carolina courts should decide who gets to adopt Veronica. The state court said the Capobiancos should raise the girl.

Last week, South Carolina Family Court Judge Daniel Martin finalized the couple's adoption, approving a transition plan detailing a gradual process for reintroducing the girl to the Capobiancos.

South Carolina authorities issued a warrant for Brown's arrest Saturday, charging Brown with custodial interference for failing to appear with the girl for a court-ordered meeting with the Capobiancos on August 4th â€” a date the couple has said was set by the judge and to which Brown's attorneys did not object.
