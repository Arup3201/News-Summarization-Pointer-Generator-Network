The Bush family doesn't waste any time indoctrinating the next generation into the world of politics.

George H.W. Bush's baby great-grandson Prescott joined his father George P. Bush in the voting booth yesterday as daddy runs for Texas land commissioner.

Baby Prescott was swept up by his mom Amanda just as dad went into the booth - but he still got an 'I Voted' sticker.

Starting them young: George P. Bush holds son Prescott while he votes in the Texas land commissioner primary on Tuesday

Baby's first vote: While Prescott is still many years away from being a voter, he still got a sticker that said 'I voted

Continuing the dynasty: George P Bush is the grandson to former president George H.W. Bush and nephew of former president George W. Bush

First political foray: He is currently running for Texas land commissioner and easily won the Republican nomination on Tuesday. Wife Amanda (left) picked up Prescott just as he started to vote

Bush easily won the Republican nomination for the position, and will face former El Paso Mayor John Cook in the general election in November.

Either Bush or Cook will replace outgoing Commissioner Jerry Patterson, who is running for Lieutenant Governor.

This is the 37-year-old attorney's first foray into politics ,spearheading a fourth-generation of the Bush dynasty.

Bush's great-grandfather Prescott was a senator from Connecticut.

On the campaign trail, Bush has addressed voters in both English and Spanish - having learned the second language from his mom Columba who is from Mexico.

Gearing up: Bush will go up against former El Paso Mayor John Cook in the November general election, Pictured above campaigning in El Paso on Monday

If he wins, Bush will be responsible for managing billions of dollars in state assets, investments and mineral rights and will also serve as chairman on several boards and commissions.

Like the conservative Bush he is, the candidate identifies as pro-life, pro-gun and pro-energy.

So far, Bush has raised more than $3.5million for his campaign - an unheard of amount for the political seat.

Opponent Cook has put $20,000 of personal money into his own campaign.

Bush accepted the Republican nomination at Joe T Garcia's restaurant in Fort Worth on Tuesday in which he made a brief speech.

'We don't need to change out conservative principles to win...we just need to change our tactics,' he said.Â
