Norman Lamb says the system is becoming dysfunctional

An ageing population has pushed the NHS and social care system to the brink of collapse, the health minister Norman Lamb has warned.

Extra pressure piled onto A&E departments and other parts of the NHS was making the system ‘dysfunctional’.

More action had to be taken to get elderly people out of hospitals to recover at home, said Mr Lamb who is in charge of care services.

Basic adaptations are not being carried out on elderly people’s homes, stopping them from leaving hospital.

A failure to organise home help was also impeding their rehabilitation in the community.

Ministers will today unveil plans to improve co-ordination between NHS services and councils to make it easier for the elderly to leave hospital.

Mr Lamb said the ageing population and the strain on the NHS was ‘the challenge of the 21st century’

He told The Daily Telegraph: ‘A&E units are under pressure, ambulances are carrying more patients than they should, signiﬁcant numbers of people are in hospital who should be cared for elsewhere.

‘The system is becoming dysfunctional and we need to do something about it.’

A review into the funding system has been announced and Mr Lamb said: ‘The hospital gets paid for a patient arriving in hospital but there is no incentive for them to leave.’

Ministers are to demand better co-ordination between the NHS and social services

Ministers want to overhaul the payments to reward improvements in patients’ conditions.

Mr Lamb said: ‘The system will collapse in the long term if we do not take decisive action now.’

The system was ‘horribly fragmented’ leading to ‘bad care — distress, crises occurring that could be avoided, massive disruption to people’s lives. If we carry on as we are the system will collapse’.

Ministers are to demand better co-ordination between the NHS and social services.

One idea is for elderly patients to be assigned their own NHS worker to oversee their transition from hospital to home.
