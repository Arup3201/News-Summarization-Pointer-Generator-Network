A 19-year-old male cadet at the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) has been granted bail on two counts of sexually assaulting his female colleagues.

Harlan Agresti was arrested on Tuesday after the two women, both of whom are also aged 19, reported sperate incidents to ADFA staff the previous day.

Mr Agresti will plead not guilty to two counts of sexual intercourse without consent when he reapears at the ACT Magistrates Court on October 30.

Harlan Agresti, a cadet from the Australian Defence Force Academy, was granted bail on Wednesday after being charged with sexually assaulting two female cadets

The 19-year-old covered his face as he left the ACT Magistrates Court: He was arrested on Tuesday by ACT police after the two women made their allegations regarding separate incidents to ADFA staff the previous day

One of the alleged offences occurred in June 2013 after a night in Civic, and the other in February this year at one of the women's Campbell homes.

The allegations were referred to the Australian Defence Force Investigative Service, which then referred them on to ACT Policing.

'Defence is providing all appropriate support to the individuals concerned,' it said in a statement on Wednesday.

Mr Agresti's bail was set at $10,000 and the conditions require him to reside in Newcastle and prohibit him from contacting the two women who have made allegations against him or any other ADFA cadets.

He was also required to give up his passport and comply with a set curfew, restricting him from leaving his home at night.

The charges come only a week after a Senate Inuiry heard that more than two dozen ADFA officers, who continue to rise through the ranks undisciplined, are alleged to have abused fellow female officer cadets in the 1990s.

The charges come only a week after Gary Rumble revealed details of his review into abuse allegations in the Australian Defence Force to a Senate Inquiry and insisted on a royal commission

As a result, the leader of the review into abuse allegations in the Australian Defence Force, Gary Rumble, has insisted that a royal commission take place.

Dr Rumble said there was a history of sexual assault and defence mismanagement from the time Australian Defence Force Academy opened in Canberra in 1986, peaking in the 1990s and diminishing but not disappearing entirely following reforms in 1998.

There was a very high risk officers in middle and senior management positions with potential to rise further, who were cadets at ADFA, raped or committed other serious sexual assaults on other cadets or did not intervene while such rape or other assaults were occuring, he told a hearing of the inquiry in Canberra last Wednesday.

Dr Rumble said it was likely there were many more perpetrators than those recorded in the so-called ADFA 24.

That case relates to 15 cases of rape and nine of sexual assault allegedly committed by maleADFA cadets against female cadets between 1994 and 1998. They were never properly investigated at the time.

However, both Defence Minister David Johnston and Len Roberts-Smith, who heads the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce, are yet to be convinced that a royal inquiry is necessary.
