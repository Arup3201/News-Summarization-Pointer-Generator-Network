Questions have been raised about whether USC's newly-named captain Josh Shaw sprained both of his ankles by jumping from a balcony to save his nephew, as he claimed.

The cornerback, who has been sidelined indefinitely due to the injuries, said he had seen the seven-year-old struggling in a swimming pool at a family party in Palmdale, California on Saturday night so he jumped from the second story to save him from drowning.

But on Tuesday afternoon, USC coach Steve Sarkisian said he has received calls questioning the validity of the story and the school is now vetting his account, the school website reported.

'I'm going to refrain from talking about the situation itself,' Sarkisian said on Tuesday. 'I will say that Josh had never given us any indication not to believe his story. He's been a kid of very high character for us, a team leader, elected team captain. I had no reason not to believe him.'

But he added that they had received some calls questioning the story so the school wanted to be diligent by investigating further. 

'Josh is adamant with what occurred, and we're going to continue to vet some of the stories that have come across our desk or our phones and see what we have and go from there,' he said.

He added that Shaw has not changed his story since the questions emerged.

The Palmdale Sheriff Station said that there was no record of a call regarding Shaw's incident.

Shaw, who had been voted captain of the team just hours before the incident, previously told USC's website, that he had seen his nephew Carter, who can not swim, struggling in the pool.

With no one else around, the 22-year-old athlete jumped off a second-story balcony and landed on  concrete below.

Despite the pain in his ankles, the football player said he was able to crawl to the pool and pull his nephew, Carter, to safety before hoisting himself out of the water. 

He said that he was taken to the hospital and diagnosed with two high ankle sprains. Carter was traumatized but is physically fine.

Shaw had been named captain of the team just hours before - but these injuries mean he will sidelined indefinitely, the website reported. 

'I would do it again for whatever kid it was, it did not have to be my nephew,' Shaw said in the report.

'My ankles really hurt, but I am lucky to be surrounded by the best trainers and doctors in the world. I am taking my rehab one day at a time, and I hope to be back on the field as soon as possible.'

Coach Sarkisian lauded his player's quick thinking when USC published the story.

'That was a heroic act by Josh, putting his personal safety aside, but that's the kind of person he is,' he said. 'It is unfortunate that he'll be sidelined for a while and we will miss his leadership and play, but I know he'll be working hard to get back on the field as soon as possible.'  

Shaw, who is from Palmdale, played at Florida as a freshman before transferring to USC.

He started all 13 games for the Trojans last season and was expected to start at cornerback this season.

Southern Cal is ranked No. 15 in the preseason by the Associated Press. The Trojans open the season on Saturday at home against Fresno State.
