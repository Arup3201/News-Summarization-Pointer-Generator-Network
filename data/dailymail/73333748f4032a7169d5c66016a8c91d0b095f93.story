The iPhone 5s could have a slow-motion camera, according to even more rumours about Apple's upcoming handset.

Code hidden inside Apple’s iOS 7 software suggests that the next iPhone could offer video recording at a rate of 120 frames-per-second (FPS) rather than around 30 frames per second.

This is fast enough to allow iPhone users to create slow-motion films. 

Code hidden inside Apple's iOS 7 software suggests that the next generation iPhone could offer video recording at a rate of 120 frames-per-second, enabling users to capture slow-motion video

According to testing undertaken by 9to5Mac the feature named ‘Mogul’ allows iPhone to capture video at an 'exceptionally precise rate.'

The resolution at which the 120FPS video could be recorded at is currently unclear.

They did, however, find out that Mogul would not activate on an iPhone 5, which suggests that it is intended for a future iPhone.

Other action cameras, such as Samsung’s flagship Galaxy S4, already include a slow-motion mode.

If the rumours are true, the addition 
could be a move by Apple to close the already narrowing gap between 
smartphones and cameras.

Based on the code, 9to5Mac believes the feature would be an option - like Panorama, Square, Video, Standard, and Filters- in the iOS 7 software.

Recent speculation has also been mounting about a fingerprint sensor following a string of code discovered in the same beta release.

The code describes a user touching the 
Home button with their thumb.

Frame rate is also known as frame frequency.

It is the rate at which a video camera can record consecutive images - called frames.

It also applies to computer graphics and motion capture devices.

Frame rate is most often listed in frames per second (FPS) but can also be as expressed  as hertz (Hz).

The human eye processes around 10 to 12 separate images, or frames, per second and is able to distinguish each frame individually. 

Early silent films had a frame rate from 14 to 24 FPS which recorded motion, but was jerky. Nowadays, motion pictures use 24 frames per second.

Shooting at a slower frame rate increases how fast the motion is when projected because the eye sees it moving quicker than in real life, and quicker than it can make out the individual frames.

Anything filmed at a higher rate of 24 FPS appears slowed down because more frames are captured per second than the eye sees so it takes longer for the images to appear in full.

A fingerprint then appears on the screen 
that changes colour.

The 
feature could be for security reasons to unlock the phone, or to 
authorise payments in the App Store and prevent people from stealing 
your phone and obtaining personal data.

The current trend in the rise of video sharing has been boosted by apps such as Vine, and features such as Video on Instagram.

Facebook
officially revealed its new video-sharing service for Instagram during a
product launch at the company's Silicon Valley headquarters last month.

The
service added a video icon to the existing Instagram app and users can 
record 15-second video clips and edit them together for longer videos.

Vine records six-second videos that can be embedded into tweets because the app is owned by Twitter.

The developer code suggests the fingerprint scanner could be built into the phone's Home button, pictured. A supply chain source in Taiwan told Reuters that Apple was trying to find a coating material that did not interfere with the fingerprint sensor, and this may be causing production problems
