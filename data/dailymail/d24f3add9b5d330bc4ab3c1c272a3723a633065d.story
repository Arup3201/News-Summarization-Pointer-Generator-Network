The ex-girlfriend of fugitive former cop Christopher Dorner came forward on Thursday to say the man she used to date had trouble acclimating to his life after his military career.

Arianna Williams, 33, spoke out about the shooter accused of killing four, saying she isn't surprised that he reached his tipping point and eventually snapped.

Police have confirmed that Dorner died on Tuesday after a massive manhunt.

'When you have a profession where you worked your whole life to really obtain something in that level of success…when you go into that environment where everyone else is not lined up with the way you believe and the way you think…after time, the stress could probably wear on you,' Williams told KCAL-TV.

Snapped: Arianna Williams spoke out about her former boyfriend, saying he bottled up his emotions

'I don’t think (that justifies) someone going out and killing anyone because they're stressed out at work. Chris, unfortunately, was one of those people…he bottled up his emotions and wasn’t good at expressing himself,' she added.

Authorities say fugitive former cop Christopher Dorner died of a single gunshot wound to the head as authorities were pumping 
tear gas into a mountain cabin during a deadly gun battle with sheriff's
deputies. 

His ex-girlfriend said she is not surprised Dorner snapped

San Bernardino County sheriff's Capt. Sheriff John McMahon told reporters Friday that it appears the wound was self-inflicted.

Deputies said they heard one final gunshot from the cabin as it was going up in flames during Tuesday's gunbattle.

Before he died, Dorner killed one sheriff's deputy and wounded another during a fierce shootout.

Authorities
initially were unsure whether Dorner killed himself, had been struck by
a deputy's bullet or had died in a fire that engulfed the cabin during 
the shootout.

The search for Dorner began last week after authorities said he had launched a deadly revenge campaign against the Los Angeles Police Department for his firing, warning that he would bring 'warfare' to LAPD officers and their families.

The manhunt brought police to Big Bear Lake, 80 miles east of Los Angeles, where they found Dorner's burned-out pickup truck abandoned. His footprints disappeared on frozen soil and hundreds of officers who searched the area and checked out each building failed to find him.

Five days later, but just a stone's throw from a command post authorities had set up in the massive manhunt, Karen and Jim Reynolds said they came face to face with Dorner inside their cabin-style condo.

The couple said Dorner bound them and put pillowcases on their heads. At one point, he explained that he had been there for days.

'He said "I don't have a problem with you, so I'm not going to hurt you,"' Jim Reynolds said. 'I didn't believe him; I thought he was going to kill us.'

Police have not commented on the 
Reynolds' account, but it renews questions about the thoroughness of a 
search for a man who authorities declared was armed and extremely 
dangerous as they hunted him across the Southwest and Mexico.

'They
said they went door-to-door but then he's right there under their 
noses. Makes you wonder if the police even knew what they were doing,' 
resident Shannon Schroepfer said. 'He was probably sitting there 
laughing at them the whole time.'

The
notion of him holed up just across the street from the command post was
shocking to many, but not totally surprising to some experts familiar 
with the complications of such a manhunt.

'Chilling. That's the only word I could use for that,' said Ed Tatosian, a retired SWAT commander for the Sacramento Police Department.

'It's not an unfathomable oversight. We're human. It happens. It's chilling (that) it does happen.'

Candy Martin, the owner of the remote mountain cabin, said she was helpless as the building in the San Bernardino National Forest became the center of a raging gun battle on Tuesday that killed one sheriff's deputy, wounded another wounded and left the fugitive murder suspect dead.

Ms Martin said she flipped on the television on Tuesday afternoon and realized that the cabins featured on the breaking news coverage of the standoff looked familiar.

The former U.S. Navy Reserve 
lieutenant made his way to Big Bear, 100 miles east of Los Angeles, last
Thursday after he went on a revenge killing spree that left three 
people dead. 

He is believed
to have shot dead the daughter of a former LAPD captain who defended 
him at a police review board hearing where Dorner was fired in 2009.

Killed: Detective Jeremiah MacKay, 35, was shot dead during the standoff with Dorner

Monica Quand was found murdered in her car in Irvine, along with her 
fiance Keith Lawrence on February 3.

Last Thursday, he wounded an LAPD officer in a shootout and then ambushed two Riverside police - killing Officer Michael Crain and gravely wounded a second patrolman.

Later that afternoon, Dorner's burning truck was found in the woods outside Big Bear. Despite an intense police search of the area for several days, Dorner was revealed to be hiding in vacant condos just across the street from the San Bernardino County Sheriff's command post.

On Tuesday, he surfaced after five days of hiding and tied up a couple after breaking into their home.

He stole their SUV, but crashed it during a police pursuit.

Dorner then carjacked a Boy Scout leader's truck.

He abandoned the vehicle and fled for Ms Martin's cabins after a shootout with a California game warden.

San Bernardino SWAT officers surrounded the cabin and engaged Dorner in a raging firefight.

Detective Jeremiah MacKay, 35, was shot and killed when Dorner tried to make an escape.

A second deputy was gravely wounded.
