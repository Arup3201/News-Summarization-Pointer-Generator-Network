A university chief came under fire yesterday over his £419,000-a-year pay packet as student leaders branded it a ‘huge insult’.

Professor David Eastwood, vice-chancellor of Birmingham University, accepted a £29,000 bonus last year on top of his £323,000 salary and £67,000 in pension and other benefits.

Accounts show the 53-year-old’s total pay for 2010/11, which includes the £16,000 running costs of his grace-and-favour university residence, was 7 per cent up on the previous year.

His basic pay is £73,000 higher than his predecessor’s just five years before – an inflation-busting 29 per cent rise. It comes as the university is preparing to treble tuition fees to £9,000-a-year and follows a Government warning to limit vice-chancellors’ pay.

Yet while some university heads took pay 
cuts last year, 56 enjoyed salary rises, with 13 accepting increases of 
more than 5 per cent.

Average pay for university heads last year was £239,000, while the highest-paid was Professor Andrew Hamilton, vice-chancellor of Oxford, on £424,000, just ahead of Professor Eastwood’s £419,000.

Liam Burns, president of the National Union of Students, called the pay rises ‘outrageous’. He said: ‘Increasing your own wage while simultaneously making the case for students to pay fees is at best politically naive and at worst a huge insult to students.’

Mark Harrop, head of the Birmingham Guild of Students, said: ‘We feel the university should pay closer attention to economic sensitivities when deciding the vice-chancellor and senior management’s pay, especially when average staff salary increases were well below inflation.’

A spokesman for Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ‘Ministers have called on universities to demonstrate pay restraint and expect that the lead on this should come from the very top.’

Professor Eastwood, an Oxford graduate who is married with three children, previously led the university funding quango, the Higher Education Funding Council for England.

The university said that he had requested a salary freeze last year and that the increase in his pay packet was partly down to him having waived half his bonus the previous year.

Ed Smith, Birmingham’s pro-chancellor, said: ‘Professor David Eastwood is the highly experienced head of a complex and successful organisation with a global reach. The university is a very significant enterprise with around 28,000 students, 6,000 staff and a turnover of over £460million.’
