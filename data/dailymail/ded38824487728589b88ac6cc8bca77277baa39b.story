Landlady? MPs will say today that the Queen should open up Buckingham Palace for longer and rent it out for commercial events

The Queen should open up Buckingham Palace for longer and rent it out for commercial events, MPs will say today.

Commons watchdogs insist the royals need more money-spinning ventures to stop their palaces crumbling after years of complacency.

The backlog of repairs is so great it will cost at least £50million to restore the Queen’s London residence and other historic buildings. Forty per cent of royal properties – including parts of Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle – are below ‘acceptable’ standards, with some in a dangerous condition.

Members of the Commons public accounts
 committee want royal courtiers to get a ‘firmer grip’ on their finances
 to stop taxpayers footing the whole bill.

‘The
 truth of the matter is that the palace has been living from hand to 
mouth for some time,’ the committee’s chairman, Margaret Hodge, told the
 Mail last night. ‘The trouble is that people are frightened, because 
this is the Royal Family, to address the issue head on.’

She suggested extending the opening season at Buckingham Palace and exploring other business opportunities.

‘The Queen is not there for much of 
the time and I find it hard to believe they can’t open the palace to the
 public for longer,’ she added.

The
 committee’s findings follow a parliamentary grilling of the sovereign’s
 most senior staff last autumn over whether the monarchy offered value 
for money to taxpayers.

Senior royal aides maintain the 
repairs backlog has built up because of a real-terms squeeze of up to 60
 per cent in their funding by governments over the past 20 years.

This, they say, has forced them to patch up the palaces instead of embark on whole-scale repairs.

But
 the MPs claimed yesterday that the Queen ‘has not been served well by 
the Royal Household and by the Treasury ... in balancing the books and 
preserving heritage buildings’.

According to MPs the Royal Household has 
fallen short by spending more than it took in. Net expenditure of 
£33.3million in 2012-2013 was 7 per cent higher than its income of 
£31million.That resulted in the 
palace taking out £2.3million from its reserves – leaving the Queen with
 just £1million in the bank. That was described by MPs as an 
‘historically low level of contingency’.

The report warned: ‘The Household 
needs to get better at planning and managing its budgets for the longer 
term – and the Treasury should be more actively involved in reviewing 
what the Household is doing.’

It
 was even more critical of what it described as the Royal Household’s 
failure to look after ‘nationally important heritage properties 
adequately’.

The Royal 
Estate encompasses about 360 buildings including Windsor Castle, 
Clarence House, St James Palace and parts of Kensington Palace.

The accounts committee is now demanding 
that staff ‘get a much firmer grip’ on how they plan to address the 
repairs backlog. MPs also urged the Queen and her staff to drum up ways 
of generating more income and achieving savings.

Buckingham Palace has been open to the paying public for around two months each summer since 1993 and small number of state apartments, particularly in St James’s and Kensington palaces, are occasionally rented out for carefully-selected commercial ventures.

It emerged that US investment bank JP Morgan hired Buckingham Palace out for a private dinner attended by the Duke of York, Tony Blair and former UN chief Kofi Annan. Last year these ventures raised £11.6million.

But MPs also highlighted the fact that
 staffing levels have remained at around 430 for the past seven years, 
with no apparent cuts.

The 
Queen receives a single pot of money known as the sovereign grant that 
she can spend largely as she wishes, on anything from funding her office
 to repairing the palace roof.

The
 grant is taken from the Crown Estate, an £8billion portfolio of 
agricultural land, buildings and property. The monarch is now, for the 
first time in two centuries, entitled to keep 15 per cent of the profits
 with the rest going to the Treasury.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said last 
night: ‘The move to the sovereign grant has created a more transparent 
and scrutinised system, which enables the Royal Household to allocate 
funding according to priorities.

'This has resulted in a more efficient
 use of public funds. The Royal Household was charged by the public 
accounts committee in 2009 to generate more income to supplement the 
funding it receives from government. This has been done successfully.

‘In 2012-13 the Household generated £11.6million in comparison with £6.7 million in 2007-8. Work on income generation continues.

‘A
 significant financial priority for the Royal Household is to reduce the
 backlog in essential maintenance across the occupied royal palaces. The
 need for property maintenance is continually assessed.'
