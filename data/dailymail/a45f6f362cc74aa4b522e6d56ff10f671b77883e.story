In the wars of the Twentieth Century, uniforms just served to keep soldiers warm - but in future wars, they're likely to be complicated electronic systems.

The Office of Naval Research is researching uniforms which can detect where soldiers have been shot - and also detect whether they have been exposed to nuclear or biological agents.

Sensors for blood, radiation and chemical poisons would be woven into the uniforms themselves - dubbed 'Intelligent Uniforms.'

Super soldier? An earlier prototype shown off by the U.S. army. One of the concerns with the new 'Intelligent Uniforms' is to keep the bulk of the uniforms down to manageable levels

The uniforms - in a proposal submitted by the ONR this week - would also carry GPS units and radios, so that their assessment of a soldier's health can be radioed back to base.

It's one of a range of hi-tech options the Pentagon and defence companies are currently researching for soldier's uniforms, including glasses that give soldiers 'super vision' and uniforms with electric fabric that allow soldiers to communicate with one another via radio.

Medical sensors built into uniforms would be no gimmick, either - at present, the first medical assessment a soldier receives is when staff reach him.

On the battlefield, there can be severe delays.

Of course, the idea here isn’t to replace medical care with material. It’s to give medics and surgeons a major head start, by offering initial diagnostics that’ll speed up the process. No doubt, that’d be an invaluable aid where soldier survival is concerned,' says Wired's Danger Room blog, which reported the proposal. 'In a situation where a soldier has been hit with either a single bullet or shrapnel from an explosion or has been exposed to chemical, biological or radioactive agents, within their surrounding environment, it is critical to quickly evaluate the vital organs that have been impacted and the life-saving procedures that need to be performed,' says the Office of Naval Research.

'With Intelligent Clothing, the location of a bullet can be determined with appropriately-embedded sensors within the clothing’s fibers that can estimate the depth of penetration and the effected surrounding organs. Additionally, if the person was in an environment where a CBRNE weapon had been stored, manufactured, or used, the Intelligent Clothing could identify the agents via specific biomarkers detected within the blood, saliva, sweat, urine.'

The hi-tech glasses under trial with the Pentagon will allow information to be 'beamed' directly into soldier's eyes from a pair of hi-tech glasses

The Pentagon has placed an order with Innovega for lenses which 
focus 3D battlefield information from drones and satellites directly into people's eyeballs.

The
tiny 'screens' sit directly on users' eyeballs and work with a pair of 
lightweight glasses with a built-in translucent screen. 

'Warfighters need to maintain their 
full vision while on the battlefield,' says the company. 'At the same 
time a tremendous amount of data, graphics and video are collected and 
are required by specific warfighters in the field.

Another groundbreaking 
high-tech military system will allow any soldier in a unit to 'see' through the eyes of any of his comrades.

The
new technology, which features communication antennas woven into the 
fabric of military uniforms, means video from a helmet-mounted camera, 
voice commands and GPS data can all be transmitted at once, even in the 
heat of battle when soldiers might be lying flat to avoid enemy fire.

The
system is designed to improve the awareness of a military team as a 
whole, allowing soldiers to see through the eyes of their team mates in 
real time.

The way the antennas work mean there 
is no need for soldiers to carry conventional radio whip-antennas which 
can be cumbersome and conspicuous.

BAE
Systems, which has developed the series of Body Wearable Antennas 
(BWA), says it allows effective communication while helping improve 
soldier's agility in the field.

A
spokesman said: 'Our demonstrator shows off the capability of this 
technology which transmits voice, video data and GPS location via the 
same antenna.

'If one soldier spots a situation, they can alert the team and share what they can see through their helmet mounted camera.

'The
demonstration system links with a wrist-mounted commercially available 
touch screen smart phone and utilises its sensors to provide an 
augmented operational picture.

'This allows the team to tag objects, such as potential hazards which will appear highlighted on the phone's video image.

'Another major advantage of the wearable antenna system is that it is unaffected by the position of the wearer.

'With
conventional whip-antenna systems, if a soldier has to lie on the 
ground, the communication between them and that of someone who is 
standing up can be severely compromised or even lost.

'Similarly,
the signal from the short antenna on a portable radio can be masked by 
the user's body. A BWA system can be designed to give continuous 360 
degree coverage.'

Jon Pinto,
Antennas and Electromagnetics Group Leader from BAE Systems Advanced 
Technology Centre said: 'Frontline soldiers carry a huge amount of 
weight when on patrol.

'Research
into body wearable antennas has shown we could reduce this burden and 
in the future give forces improved communication capabilities and a 
significant advantage on the battlefield.'

BAE
Systems is now exploring the potential of incorporating the system into
the suits of fire-fighters for use during search and rescue, and for 
police patrol team members.
