Militants aligned with the self-proclaimed 'Islamic State' (ISIS) boasted Monday on Twitter that the terror army was responsible for U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel's ouster.

'The Islamic State has toppled the US defense minister,' one of the group's social media agitator gloated Monday on Twitter, launching a hashtag with the same message.

ISIS, known for its gruesome beheading videos, was praised in a long stream of tweets featuring a Photoshopped image depicting Hagel's head being severed.

Other images featured cartoons of Obama kicking Hagel in the backside and mocking Hagel with emoji for getting choked up during his farewell remarks. 

'Obama: You failed,' several of those tweets read in Arabic. 'Hagel: You need to slaughter dementia.'

Hagel's sentimental side showed during his remarks alongside Obama on Monday, and ISIS sympathizers were quick to mock him for it

'Obama, the mule of the Jews, has accepted Hagel's resignation,' read another.

'The resignation of US Secretary of War has shaken the thrones of tyrants everywhere,' claimed a third.

Hagel submitted his resignation Monday following pressure from President Barack Obama, multiple sources confirmed.

Administration officials said Obama made the decision Friday to ask his defense secretary, the only Republican in his cabinet, to step down after a series of meetings during the past month.

The scapegoating move was characterized as a summary firing in some corners of the Obama administration.

'Make no mistake, Secretary Hagel was fired,” a plugged-in senior U.S. official told Fox News.

This same official discounted Pentagon claims it was a mutual decision claiming President Obama has lost confidence in Hagel and that the White House had been planning to announce his exit for weeks.

'The president felt he had to fire someone. He fired the only Republican in his cabinet. Who is that going to piss off that he cares about?' 

Hagel, 68, was brought into the Pentagon five years after retiring from the U.S. Senate to manage a continuing troop withdrawal from Afghanistan and oversee a shrinking Defense Department as the Obama administration managed budget reductions required by automatic cuts in the 2013 federal budget. 

Clearing him out of the Pentagon as America returns to more active war footing will dangle a tantalizing history-making opportunity in front of the president, with a female successor among the most logical candidates under discussion for the first time in American history.

The first serious signs that Hagel had fallen out of favor emerged in August as the White House began focusing on a strategy to push back against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.

KNIVES OUT: ISIS makes no bones about taunting and threatening US officials and it's taking credit for Hagel's sacking

Obama had mocked the terror group in an interview with The New Yorker in response to a question about the group's violent resurgence.

'I think the analogy we use around here sometimes, and I think is accurate, is if a JV team puts on Lakers uniforms, that doesn’t make them Kobe Bryant,' the president said.

'I think there is a distinction between the capacity and reach of a bin Laden and a network that is actively planning major terrorist plots against the homeland versus jihadists who are engaged in various local power struggles and disputes, often sectarian.'

In contrast, Hagel told reporters on August 21 that ISIS is 'an imminent threat to every interest we have, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else.' 

And when he was asked to compare ISIS threats to the U.S. homeland with the 9/11 terror attacks, he said they were 'as sophisticated and well-funded as any group we have seen.'

'They are beyond just a terrorist group. They marry ideology and a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess,' he insisted. 'They are tremendously well-funded. This is beyond anything we've seen.'

House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement Monday morning after Hagel's resignation became official that the 'personnel change must be part of a larger re-thinking of our strategy to confront the threats we face abroad, especially the threat posed by the rise of ISIL.'

'We cannot defeat this enemy without a broad, coordinated, well-thought-out effort that has the strong support of the American people,' Boehner continued.

'Thus far, this administration has fallen well short.'

Hagel's departure will likely be welcomed by some parts of America's Jewish lobby as well.

The Emergency Committee for Israel, a strident conservative political group, launched a critical website using own Hagel's name – chuckhagel.com – when he was first floated as a possible defense secretary in 2013.
