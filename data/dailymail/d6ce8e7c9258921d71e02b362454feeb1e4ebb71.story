Overshare: Matt and Shannon Moskal were the public faces of an Allstate campaign to make people aware that tweeting can attract burglars

This is the real-life couple whose oversharing social media habits made them the stars of a commercial where their home appeared to be robbed and all their possession sold off.

Matt and Shannon Moskal, both 25, were seized upon by Allstate insurers, who noticed their tendency to post so much sensitive information online they were prime candidates for burglary.

And, using national television and the big screens of the College Bowl as their platform, the company staged an elaborate fake robbery of their home in Illinois to teach them - and others - a lesson.

At the start of the game, Allstate's robber mascot Mayhem, played by Dean Winters, appeared on the big screens to 'thank' the Moskals for revealing they were at the game in New Orleans - and therefore not home to guard their things.

He told viewers: 'I'm kind of a social media nerd - I'm also kind of a burglar. So when the people who live here posted live from tonight's game I did what any self-respecting nerd-burglary would do.

'I let myself in and started selling their stuff live on the internet...'

Allstate then directed viewers to an online marketplace containing an exact inventory of all their possessions, sold at ludicrously low prices, culminating in their car, which went for $200.

Going... gone: The couple revealed that their possessions were painstakingly recreated, then sold for real via a promotional website while the ad campaign was running

In an interview with ABC News, the real-life couple revealed that they were tracked down by market researchers months in advance, who then recreated their home for the commercial.

Part of what sealed the deal was a series of posts from the couple's Puerto Rico honeymoon, which went up in real-time and was proof of a substantial voyage.

For the stunt, Allstate made real-life replicas of 300 of the couple's possessions, which were genuinely sold and shipped to the first bidder,

Shannon said: 'It was disconcerting to know our car could be sold for $200 or that this could really happen as a result of oversharing on social media.'

They said they have reviewed their privacy settings - which were previously stuck on 'public' - as a result of the campaign - but admitted it's unlikely they will stop sharing as much, or as often.
