West Bromich Albion manager Alan Irvine is weighing up bids for Switzerland striker Haris Seferovic and French winger Jonathan Biabiany.

Seferovic, 22, plays for Real Sociedad but struggled to score regular goals for the La Liga outfit last season.

Biabiany, who joined Parma two years ago from Sampdoria for about £2m and has since extended his contract until 2018, is also on Southampton's list of potential targets.

Forward thinking: West Brom are weighing up a move for Real Sociedad striker Haris Seferovic

Meanwhile, Aston Villa are set to rival the Baggies for the signature of Chelsea winger Victor Moses.

The Nigerian international is still deemed surplus to requirements at Stamford Bridge after an inauspicious loan spell at Liverpool last season.

West Brom have already broken their transfer record this summer with the £10million signing of Dynamo Kiev star Ideye Brown, despite Irvine admitting he had never seen him play.

Wing man: The baggies are also considering making a bid for Parma forward Jonathan Biabiany

West Brom spent a record £10million on a player manager Alan Irvine has admitted he has never seen play.

The Baggies shelled out on the player after taking advice from club scouts and watching DVDs.

And
 while the move will raise some eyebrows, Irvine is perfectly happy he's
 made the right move in spending such a huge amount of the club's cash.
