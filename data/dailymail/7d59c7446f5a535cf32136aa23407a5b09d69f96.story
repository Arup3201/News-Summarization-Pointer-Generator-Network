A dog caught by the Taliban could win the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross.

The dog, named DaGarwal, the Pashto for Colonel, was seized on a failed SAS raid in Afghanistan in December, during which Captain Richard Holloway, 29, was killed.

The Belgian shepherd is ‘fit and healthy’ and living on chicken and beef kebabs, his captors claimed yesterday.

Award: DaGarwal could be awarded the Victoria Cross for his bravery

Film footage posted online showed the bearded gunmen parading the small dog as a trophy.

The video shows Colonel wearing a specially adapted protective jacket fitted with a GPS tracking device, a torch and camera to beam back footage as the animals move around the battlefield.

The insurgents said the dog was captured during an SAS operation alongside the Afghan National Army in Laghman province, east of the capital Kabul, on December 23.

That was the day Capt Holloway, 29, a member of the Royal Engineers who was serving with the elite Who Dares Wins unit, was killed by enemy fire in the same area.

Despite calls for military chiefs to plot a rescue mission, British Army sources said this scenario was ‘unlikely’.

‘We all recognise what a vital role our dogs play on the frontline but there would be an outcry if a soldier was killed during a raid behind enemy lives to snatch back the dog,’ said the source.

Last night it was revealed that Colonel could be in line for a Dickin Medal to mark his life-saving bravery on the frontline.

The People’s Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA) charity, which awards the medal, said that the dog was ‘worthy of consideration’ for an honour.

To receive a medal, Colonel must be nominated formally by his regiment or the Royal Army Veterinary Corps.

A PDSA spokesman said: ‘The Dickin Medal is awarded to animals for gallantry in armed conflict and from the information gathered about this particular dog, it would appear to potentially have met the criteria.’

The Ministry of Defence has not commented on the reports, but a spokesman for the ISAF confirmed a military working dog went missing during an operation late last year.

The Nato-led mission would not confirm whether the animal belonged to British forces, but the Pentagon admitted it in a briefing.

There have been no demands for the release or ransom of the dog, which is said to be being held by a notoriously brutal commander known as Abu Zarqawi.

Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said Colonel was being kept ‘in a safe place’ and was in good health.

He said: ‘Right now we are keeping the dog and trying to look after him. It is not like the local dogs which will eat anything and sleep anywhere.

‘We have to prepare him proper food and make sure he has somewhere to sleep properly.

‘We haven’t decided what to do with it yet. Maybe we will keep it and use it ourselves because it has been trained.’

Military working dogs are used by troops in Afghanistan both for protection and sniffing out drugs, firearms and roadside bombs.

Dogs can be strapped to their handlers’ chests and parachuted into combat zones.

The Ministry of Defence said last year that four dogs have been killed in service in Helmand Province since March 2011 - two labradors, a German shepherd and a springer spaniel cross.

One of the four was apparently shot by the Taliban on a mission.

But while concerns have been raised for the Taliban’s latest prisoner, an Australian dog captured in Afghanistan had a lucky escape.

After being adopted by a Taliban leader, black labrador Sabi was eventually rescued by an American soldier.

Since the Dickin Medal was introduced in 1943, the PDSA has awarded it to 64 animals who displayed conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty.

It has been awarded to 28 dogs, 32 World War II messenger pigeons, three horses and one cat.

The most recent was awarded in October 2012 to Theo, a record-breaking Army sniffer dog, who was killed along with his handler Lance Corporal Liam Tasker in Afghanistan.

The 22-month-old pooch died of a seizure shortly after his master was shot dead in 2011.

A Dickin Medal has previously been awarded to a dog who was a prisoner of war.

In 1942, Royal Navy mascot Judy was captured by the Japanese when HMS Grasshopper was hit by torpedoes.

In an attempt to secure official protection for Judy, Leading Aircraftsman Frank Williams persuaded the camp commandant to officially register Judy as history’s only canine prisoner of war - officially POW 81A Medan.

Judy protected the British service personnel by distracting the camp guards when they were administering punishment to the prisoners.

She survived to witness the Japanese surrender in August 1945 and returned to the UK a national hero.
