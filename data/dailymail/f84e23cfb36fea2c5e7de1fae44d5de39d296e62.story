Peter Schmeichel has picked his #one2eleven of stars he played alongside throughout his career

GOALKEEPER: PETER SCHMEICHEL

I've only ever played with myself in goal. I would never do that, normally. But I'm in goal.

DEFENDER: GARY NEVILLE

This week he was pundit of the year. That is so typical of Gary Neville. That's him. Whenever he sticks his head to something, he wants to be the best. He probably wasn't the biggest talent, but pure will and so dependable. This guy was unbelievable. You could depend on him.

DEFENDER: JAAP STAM

I only played with him for one year and that was a very successful year, winning the treble. He was awesome. I took up smoking that year because I had nothing to do. I was up against the goalpost smoking because I had Jaap in front of me. He was  big, strong, quick, unbelievably quick. This guy was quick on half a yard, three yards, 20 yards, 50 yards.

DEFENDER: STEVE BRUCE

He was there when I arrived at Manchester United. He was a really good friend. I ended up living next door to him, so he looked after me and my family. I've never played with a player so brave. He was never quick. He was slow, but unbelievable. He could read the game. He was never, ever, ever scared to sacrifice himself in order to do one tiny little thing for the good of the team.

DEFENDER: DENIS IRWIN

What can you say about Denis Irwin that hasn't been said before? Doing this team I'm thinking about as a defender you'd remember what mistakes they made. I couldn't come up with a single mistake. So dependable, so reliable. His personality was really, really good for the back four of the team because we had so many outspoken personalities. He would be the guy in between. Set pieces. Fantastic shooting technique, and he would score goals from open play as well. Not many full-backs do that.

MIDFIELDER: DAVID BECKHAM

What David Beckham has done with his life, people will remember him for that. I hope people won't forget how good a player he was. Not only was he a good player but he is the one guy with the best kicking technique I've ever seen in my life. That came from talent to begin with. Hard work. He was one of the guys who took lessons off what Eric Cantona did. Doing stuff on your own for instance. No-one did that at Manchester United. David Beckham never cut a corner. He got his rewards.

MIDFIELDER: ROY KEANE

A person of many different things but for 90 minutes when we played football this guy was unbelievable. I can't remember anyone who had the energy to run box to box, or 120 if it went to extra time. Keep doing the same thing, keep doing the same thing. Driving everybody to do the same. In his prime he was probably one of the best midfield players in the world.

MIDFIELDER: PAUL SCHOLES

When I came to United he was a kid back then, playing in the youth team, but he was a striker. You could see there was something very special about him. His technique was incredible. He was converted into a midfield player. Scholes's passes, any kind of distance, from one yard to 40 yards, they were always accurate.

MIDFIELDER: RYAN GIGGS

We know the goal he scored in the semi-final against Arsenal. Unbelievable thing to do. It's been shown time and time again because it is the best goal ever scored in the FA Cup. From 16 years of age to this year, to be able to perform at that level, to give the team so much, this guy has got to be the best Premier League player of all time. What he has given Manchester United and what he still gives Manchester United is fantastic.

MIDFIELDER: MICHAEL LAUDRUP

Probably the best player I've ever played with. It's a shame he hasn't played in this country but this is a guy who played in one of the best Barcelona teams ever. He made the journey to Madrid, and played in one of the best Madrid teams ever. Won everything that football has to offer. 

STRIKER: ERIC CANTONA

The king. Changed everything for us. We had one season in 95 we were struggling. We really, really didn't play the way we should. This guy just changed everything. A different approach to games. Unbelievable.
