A Connecticut judge has ruled that the 911 recordings from Sandy Hook Elementary School will be released publicly even though the parents of the slain students pushed for them to be sealed.

The recordings, which capture the horrific moments when last Decemberâ€™s attack unfolded, are scheduled to be released on December 4- just ten days before the first anniversary.

The state's Freedom of Information Commission ruled in September that the recordings should be provided to The Associated Press, but State's Attorney Stephen Sedensky III asked for a stay while he appeals that order.

Heartbreaking: The judge ruled that the 911 calls should be released because they will be used to vindicate the actions of the emergency responders who arrived at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012

The prosecutor still does have the chance to appeal the release, which was announced on Tuesday afternoon.

'The court recognizes and is deeply sensitive to the fact that the families and friends of those who died in this tragedy, as well as others in the greater Newtown community, may desire that the 911 audio recordings never be released,' New Britain Superior Court Judge Eliot Prescott wrote.

'The public airing by the media of some or all of the recordings that will undoubtedly follow their release will likely be a searing reminder of the horror and pain of that awful day.'

But the judge said the recordings are public, and he rejected arguments for keeping them sealed.

He said that the release will help the public gauge the appropriateness of law enforcement's response.

'In
fact, public analysis of the recordings may serve to vindicate and 
support the professionalism and bravery of the first responders... who 
themselves have undoubtedly been subject to emotional turmoil and pain 
in witnessing the scene at Sandy Hook Elementary School,' Prescott 
wrote.

'Delaying the release of the audio recordings, particularly where the legal justification to keep them confidential is lacking, only serves to fuel speculation about and undermine confidence in our law enforcement officials.'

The AP has sought the recordings in part to examine the police response to the massacre, which left 20 first-graders and six educators dead.

If the recordings are released, the AP would review the content and determine what, if any, of it would meet the news cooperative's standards for publication.

The announcement about the release of the tapes comes one day after a new collection of crime scene photos were made public, showing how shooter Adam Lanza taped over his bedroom windows with garbage bags.

The explosive 44-page report offers a detailed look at the massacre that rocked the nation but no motive could be established.

Lanza, 20, was obsessed with Columbine and other mass murders and drove by the Newtown, Connecticut school the day before his heartbreaking rampage.

He also plotted his own death by watching videos of suicides and had taken pictures of himself holding a rifle and separately a handgun to his head.

Questions are being raised about the relationship between the boy and his mother, because even though friends say she would have done anything for her son, they exhibited some unusual behavior which was unearthed in the investigation.

They would communicate via email even though they lived in the same house, and she would never check his room- which he would not allow- even though she knew he was not taking his psychological medication and had an affinity for guns.

Lanza's fascination with violence was apparent to teachers and other acquaintances. He collected materials on mass killings and kept a spreadsheet ranking of mass murders.

Lanza, 20, shot his mother in the head four times Dec. 14, then drove to Sandy Hook Elementary School, where he killed 20 first-graders and six women with a semi-automatic rifle. He committed suicide as police arrived.

Nancy Lanza, who was divorced from Adam's father, indicated that she did not work because of her son's condition. In their spacious Newtown home, she catered to his requests, cooking to his specifications and getting rid of a cat because he did not want it in the house.

She often took her soon shooting at a gun range. She legally purchased all of the weapons that her son carried the day of the massacre, and she had written a check to buy him a pistol for Christmas.

A friend of Nancy Lanza's, Marvin LaFontaine, said that she was a devoted mother to her two sons and that she showed up at Adam's elementary school to protect him when he was picked on by other children.

James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston, said Nancy Lanza did not ignore her son's psychological problems and cannot be blamed for his actions.

'She was a victim, not an accessory,' he said. 'We can easily second-guess parents, and there's a lot there we can question, but the fact of the matter is many people commit horrible crimes despite the best efforts of parents, siblings and others.'

Tapes were originally planned to be sealed but that ruling was overturned

Are now scheduled to be released on December 4 but that gives enough time for the decision to be appealed
