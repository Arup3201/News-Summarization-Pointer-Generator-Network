Andros Townsend made a short trip across north London from White Hart Lane to Alexandra Palace to enjoy a night at the darts.

The Tottenham winger was in the crowd at the World Darts Championship on Tuesday to watch the last of the first-round action two days before Christmas.

Townsend was also there in support of girlfriend Hazel O'Sullivan, who was one of the walk on girls during the London event.

The couple certainly look to be very much in love with O'Sullivan recently taking to Twitter to thank Townsend for sending her flowers despite being in another country.

She wrote: 'I'm in another country & he still managed to surprise me with flowers to my door on my birthday @andros_townsend'. 

The 23-year-old has been spotted watching darts before as he was pictured at London's O2 Arena for the Premier League final in May.

And he was back on Tuesday night at Alexandra Palace, which is 3.6 miles away from White Hart Lane, to watch the likes of Adrian Lewis, Mervyn King and Vincent van der Voort.

Townsend has played 14 times for Tottenham in all competitions this season, but his only goal came in a Europa League tie against Asteras.

He also scored for England in their 5-0 win over San Marino in a Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley.
