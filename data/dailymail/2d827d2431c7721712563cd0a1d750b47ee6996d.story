A daughter spoke in court today about how her refugee mother's desire for a new start in America is what drove her to have the 'House of Horrors' abortion that killed her.

Yashoda Gurung gave evidence today at the trial of Dr Kermit Gosnell - a doctor charged with eight murder counts for procedures at the Women's Medical Society Clinic in Philadelphia.

The 24-year-old said her mother, Karnamaya Mongar, who said she couldn't afford to have another baby in her new country, went to Gonsell's clinic on November 19 2009 out of desperation on discovering she was 16 weeks pregnant.

She had only been in the U.S. six months as a political refugee from her native Nepal and had been refused treatment at two other clinics.

'She said 'We're just getting started here,' Gurung said.

Gurung, of Woodbridge, Virginia, testified through a Nepalese translator
and wept when the court was shown a smiling photograph of her mother 
and father Ash Mongar - new immigrants posing inside the Smithsonian's 
air and space museum.

She said a female worker had tried to calm her when she heard ambulance sirens outside the clinic:

Karnamaya, who had three children, allegedly died from an overdose of anesthetic drug Demerol  at the clinic.

According to her daughter, the 41-year-old waited for hours for doctor Gosnell to arrive for the procedure.

She said untrained assistants gave her mother labor inducing drugs and painkillers while she was waiting.

Murder? Some former employees at the Women's Medical Society, said many women came to the clinic for abortions but looked as if they were too far along in their pregnancies to be there

Firefighters had to cut bolts off the side door of the clinic to take her to hospital.

She died the next day at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.

Gosnell charged with her death and the murder of seven babies born alive at the premises.

If the jury finds him guilty the 72-year-old could be sentenced to death.

Karnamaya's family also has a wrongful-death lawsuit pending against the doctor.

'I want justice,' Gurung told CBS.

Gosnell denies the charges.
