A British soldier has been killed in Afghanistan while on sentry duty, the Ministry of Defence said today.

The soldier from 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards was serving in the Nahr-e-Saraj district of Helmand Province when he was killed by 'enemy action' on Friday.

Next of kin have been informed and have asked for a 24-hour period before further details are released.

It brings the total number of British servicemen and women killed in Afghanistan since 2001 to 425.

Major Ian Lawrence, spokesman for Task Force Helmand, said: 'It is with great sadness I must inform you that a soldier from 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards has been killed whilst on sentry duty in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand Province.

'The thoughts and prayers of everyone in the Task Force are with his family and friends at this very difficult time.'

The soldier's death brings the number of members of UK forces to have died since operations in Afghanistan began in October 2001 to 425.

Three British soldiers have been killed in Helmand Province so far this month.

Lieutenant Andrew Chesterman, 26, of the 3rd Battalion, The Rifles, was fatally wounded in Helmand province on Thursday last week.

A day later, Lance Corporal Matthew David Smith, 36, of the Corps of Royal Engineers, was also fatally wounded in the same Nad-e Ali district.

Lt Chesterman, originally from Guildford, Surrey, was commanding a vehicle patrol when the lead vehicle was struck by a roadside bomb. He was shot as he tried to help.
