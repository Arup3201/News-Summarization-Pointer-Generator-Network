Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo is backing Norwegian young gun Martin Odegaard to be a hit at the Bernabeu.

The 16-year-old has toured Europe's elite clubs as he prepares to leave Stromsgodset, with Los Blancos his likely destination after training with them last week ahead of a possible switch.

And Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo has given the teenage sensation the thumbs up.

'[He is a] good player. He's a young boy who can still grow - he's 16 years old,' said Ronaldo.

'He has a good future. We must give him time to learn and to take the best decisions, but I see a lot of potential in the player. [He has a] good left foot.'

Odegaard watched from the stands as Real lost to city rivals Atletico last week after he flew to Spain for advanced talks.

The teenage sensation has also been linked with Bayern Munich, Liverpool, Barcelona and both Manchester clubs, but looks poised to move to Madrid instead.
