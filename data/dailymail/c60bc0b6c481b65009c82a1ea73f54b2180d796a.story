Killer: Suffolk Strangler Steve Wright was convicted of murdering five prostitutes in Ipswich

The News of the World was accused yesterday of jeopardising the hunt for the Suffolk Strangler by hiring former special forces soldiers to follow officers tracking suspects in the case.

Dave Harrison, a retired officer with the Serious Organised Crime Agency, told the Leveson Inquiry that evidence in the 2006 investigation could have been lost and the prosecution case weakened as a result of the paper’s actions.

He said the distraction of avoiding the now-defunct tabloid’s monitoring could have resulted in the killer being ‘lost’ by officers and going on to commit further murders.

In December 2006, before anyone was charged in relation to the case, Suffolk Police asked Soca to provide surveillance officers to follow suspects as part of their investigation into the murders of five prostitutes in Ipswich.

During a briefing, Mr Harrison and other Soca officers were told the News of the World had employed its own surveillance team, made up of ex-special forces soldiers, ‘to identify any suspects we were working on, and to identify us and our operating base’.

He said their activities ‘jeopardised the murder inquiry’ and could have resulted in ‘tragic consequences’. ‘If our surveillance had been weakened by having to try and avoid other surveillance teams looking for us, if we had lost the subject, he may have gone and committed further murders because we were dealing with something else,’ he said.

Asked how the paper knew that Soca officers were being sent to Ipswich, he said: ‘My opinion is it would have come from someone close to the investigation team, either the Suffolk inquiry or Soca.

‘We identified them because they were sat in the position that we would sit in if we were doing the same job.’

He added: ‘We were told that they were probably ex-special forces soldiers who would have a good knowledge of surveillance techniques.’

Later that month, Steve Wright was arrested and in February 2008 he was convicted of killing all five women and handed a whole-life sentence.

Despite the successful outcome, the former investigator was critical of the newspaper, which was closed last July after it emerged staff had hacked murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler’s phone.

Victims: Gemma Adams, 25, and  19-year-old Tania Nicol who were two of the five people killed by Steve Wright

In his witness statement, Mr Harrison 
wrote that ‘many murderers revisit the scene of the crime’ and if caught
in the act by police surveillance, this can provide ‘extremely 
important’ evidence to the prosecution.

‘In this case, if the suspect had 
decided to re-visit the scene, to dispose of additional evidence, or to 
move a body that had not yet been found and he realised he was being 
followed, he may have cancelled or postponed his trip,’ he said.

‘He would not care whether he was 
being followed by a “legitimate” surveillance team or one employed by a 
newspaper. The evidence would be lost and the prosecution case 
weakened.’

Daily Express crime correspondent John
Twomey, who is chairman of the Crime Reporters’ Association, said the 
NoW’s decision to use a surveillance team to follow police was 
‘shocking’.

The inquiry also heard that the Sunday
Mirror used counter-surveillance techniques when it interviewed one of 
the suspects in the case.

Mr Harrison said officers observed the
man being ‘picked up and driven round by a team that carried out 
anti-surveillance manoeuvres before dropping him off at a hotel to be 
interviewed’.
