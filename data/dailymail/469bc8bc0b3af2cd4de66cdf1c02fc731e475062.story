Last week the World's 50 Best Restaurant Awards – one of the culinary world's most prestigious honours – were announced.

The list held few surprises, with the top ten restaurants largely unchanged from last year, and once more the list featured strikingly few women.

Of the top 50 restaurants in the world, only three had a female head chef or owner and no restaurant on the list had a solo female head chef, with each of the female chefs working with a male partner – their husband, boyfriend, or father.

The highest-ranked restaurant run by a woman is Arzak, in San Sebastian Spain, which was named eighth best in the world, and is jointly managed by Elena Arzak, 44, and her father Juan Mari.

Ms Arzak said that her success comes from growing up in a society where women were encouraged to reach the highest professional echelons.

'We are a matriarchal society where the woman has always been very strong. So I grew up in a society… where being a woman chef is normal,' said Ms Arzak.

'For example my grandmother was a chef, my great-grandmother as well... in Arzak, 80 percent of the staff are women,' she said.

Ms Arzak acknowledges that these figures are unusual and says that when she worked at restaurants in Switzerland, France, and Britain, she was often the only woman working in the kitchen.

According to a study of U.S. restaurants by Bloomberg, women make up only six percent of head chef positions at restaurants.

When that figure is expanded to include chefs as well as head cooks, the figure increased to only 19 percent, less than female CEOs, of which there are 24 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Elena Arzak, 44, runs the restaurant with her father, 72-year-old Juan Mari Arzak. She began working in the Arzak kitchen at the age of 11

It was this lack of female chefs in professional kitchens that led to the creation of a new award in 2011, which is voted on by the same 900 panellists who choose the top 50 restaurants – the Veuve Clicquot World's Best Female Chef Award.

'Professional kitchens very much remain a male-dominated world and we think that balance should be rectified where possible,' said William Drew, Group Editor of the awards.

'One of the ways of doing that is by celebrating those female chefs who have been and are successful with a view to inspiring the next generation of young women to follow them into that profession.'

The award has come under fire for being unnecessary and patronising to women, criticism that Mr Drew is well aware of.

'In theory, one shouldn't need an award that separates out female chefs from male chefs, if we lived in a world of equality that wouldn't be necessary… but as it is, the vast majority of chefs are men. That will hopefully not be the case generations down the line, but while that is the case, we're taking some positive action to go a small way to rectifying that.'

The winner of the award this year was 35-year-old Helena Rizzo, who runs Mani in Sao Paulo, Brazil, which was ranked 36th in the world, with husband Daniel Redondo.

'Working in the kitchen is as hard for men as it is for women. The long hours, the heat of the kitchen, the cuts, the burns, the weekend shifts. To be in this profession you have to give up many other things,' she said.

However, Ms Rizzo does think the Veuve Clicquot Best Female Chef Award is a helpful step in rectifying the gender disparity in the industry.

'I hope [it] makes the gastronomic world open its eyes to the work of more female chefs,' she said.

Ms Rizzo, who was a model and an architect before taking up professional cooking, met her husband while they were both working at El Celler de Can Roca in Spain. The pair have run Mani together since 2006.

Having a supportive partner seems to be crucial to the success of female chefs. Elena Arzak, who won the Veuve Clicquote prize in 2012, is married to Manu Lamosa, an architect, with whom she has two children – Nora, nine, and Matteo, seven. She says her husband is very involved with raising the children, who see more of their father than they do of her.

'As long as they see you are happy, they are happy… I think it's very important to be positive and set an example,' said Ms Arzak. 'I don't want to say it's easy. It's not easy; nothing is easy in life if you want to work hard.'

But she is hopeful that 'little by little' things will change and awards like the Best Female Chef Award will no longer be necessary as the culinary world stops taking such notice of gender.

'As a woman I am quite feminine; but when I cook no one notices,' said Ms Arzak.
