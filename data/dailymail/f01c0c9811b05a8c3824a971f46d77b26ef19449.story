A homeless man who received a surprise meal and hotel stay after spending a $100 donation on food for his friends has insisted that no part of the experience was a hoax - despite the fact one witness is claiming the whole thing was a set-up.

The man - named only as Thomas - had been filmed living on the streets of California, before being taken to a sushi restaurant, given a hotel room with  hot tub and treated to a new suit and haircut .

But the resulting video posted online by 'serial prankster' Josh Paler Lin was met with varying degrees of skepticism, with a number of viewers dismissing it as a hoax.

One witness, in particular, has insisted that there was no way that Thomas did not know he was being filmed as in the original video he arrived at the liquor store in the same car as Paler Lin.

Smartened up: In Josh Paler Lin's newsest video, homeless Thomas, who became an internet hit after spending a $100 donation on food for his friends, is given a new suit and a makeover

Nursing student Taugan Tan Kadalim, 26, told Vocativ that he was outside the liquor store on the day in question and he saw Paler Lin - who is recognized from his previous videos - in the driver's seat.

In the passenger seat, he claims, was Thomas. 

Kadalim told the site: 'While I think the guy is homeless, it is clear that from what I saw every part of that scene was staged.'

However, Thomas has now spoken to Fox LA, insisting that to him it was 'all a surprise' and he had never met Josh before he was handed the $100.

He told the news channel: 'I appreciate it, most definitely. It's all a surprise to me. I thought this was just a project video, I had no idea this was going where it went.

Thomas added: 'Normally people give you a dollar, maybe five as a big tip, but a hundred, wow that's a week's worth. Crazy.'

Paler Lin had initially set out to 'expose homeless people' in Los Angeles by giving them cash in the expectation that they will spend it on alcohol.

However, Thomas proved to be an exception. Instead, he spent the money on food to share with his friends, prompting Paler Lin to return and surprise Thomas with a Christmas meal, makeover and a night in a hotel.

Gesture... with an agenda? Skeptics have picked holes in a viral video showing a homeless man spending a $100 donation on food for his beggar friends, deeming it a 'fake' creation that was focused on making money

The feel-good videos, that have gained more than 26million views, are part of a campaign to raise more than $120,000, via an Indiegogo page for Thomas to get his life back on track.

But critics pointed to a number of apparent flaws in the footage, as well as the hefty profit Paler Lin has reportedly made from its success - up to a huge $52,000 

YouTube users have been skeptical about Paler Lin's motivation, suggesting it is a 'set-up' so he can gain traffic and profit.

One YouTube user, with the handle ClemtheRanter, said: 'A large number of YouTube prank videos are staged,' he said. 'I was involved in a bloody eyeball scare prank by Josh Paler Lin. My part of the video was staged... me getting scared by Josh.

Twist: The short film sees 'serial prankster' Josh Paler Lin give $100 to a beggar named Thomas in Los Angeles, California - only for him to walk into a Liquor Mart (left) and buy food for his struggling friends (right)

'I asked him if he could give me a shout-out and put my name in the description below so I can get some traffic to my YouTube channel, but it never happened.

'So now i'm addressing this issue due to a number of YouTube pranksters getting exposed for making stage pranks.' 

Other users have claimed that homeless feel-good films are a sure-fire way of boosting traffic - and consequently, money, via advertisements - on the social networking site.

'They go to a homeless person and make a feel-good video because they know that's going to get views,' said one YouTube user, referring to the site's personalities, such as Paler Lin.

Skepticism: Now, viewers have questioned the video's authenticity, citing a number of 'flaws' in the footage. Above, Lin is pictured in a Facebook photo. He is well-known for producing 'prank' videos for YouTube

Indeed, in November 2013, Paler Lin gave another homeless man $100 and told an actor playing a beggar to approach him to ask for money for food. Again, the real beggar handed over some cash.

The user, with the handle '24/7 rants', claimed the start of Paler Lin's recent homeless video - which sees the director hand Thomas $100, before secretly following him with a camera - immediately suggests it may be a hoax.

Speaking in his own video, he said Paler Lin could not possibly have guaranteed the man was going to pick up his things and spend the money immediately, instead of remaining by the roadside.

'How did he know he was going to spend the money immediately? He had no idea,' he said. 

He also picked holes in the claim that Thomas did not notice the camera - nor Paler Lin (who has a distinctive haircut) - following him throughout the duration of his trip to a nearby Liquor Mart. 

After shopping at the Mart, Thomas was filmed emerging with bags filled with food, before going straight to a park, where he handed out the goods to a number of homeless people.

Wit his new look and wardrobe, Thomas was treated to a buffet meal at the end of the day by Paler Lin 

However, the user questioned the beggar's choice of a Liquor Mart a 34-minute walk away for his food shop - instead of a nearer, cheaper supermarket - saying: 'It seems like an odd coincidence'.

'Why would this guy, of all places, go to a liquor store to buy chips and pie or whatever when you think that there are tons of other places to go to... that are convenient, probably cheaper. 

However, Paler Lin argued that Thomas chose the liqour store because it was closest to his begging spot, saying: 'When people see you getting all this traffic they want to bring you down.'

When questioned by DailyMail.com, he did not explain why Thomas chose to drag several bags of food 34 minutes to the park, instead of shopping at least two stores that were closer to the park.

But he strongly denied staging any of his films or having met Thomas before the $100 exchange.  

'I had little expectation, maybe he would buy alcohol maybe he wouldn't,' he said of the video. 'I wanted to see what a homeless person would spend it on. No one has ever done that before.'

However, the YouTube user claimed the number of hits received by Paler Lin's previous YouTube videos - between 600,000 to 800,000, according to socialblade.com, a site that tracks YouTube channel statistics - could have prompted him to construct what he knew would be a viral hit.

Indeed, Paler Lin - who earns money based on how many users view his videos, most of which are 'pranks' - not only scooped $52,000 from the film, but also gained 13,000 new subscribers.  

After the video went viral, Paler Lin said on YouTube: 'I wasn't expecting to get this kind of footage. To be honest, I thought this video would be more an exposing homeless people video at first.'  

He added: 'I'm so glad that I could witness and capture such a beautiful moment. This has to be one of the most amazing experience so far on this channel. 

In the footage, Thomas told Paler Lin he had quit his job to look after his parents, but after both of them died, he couldn't afford to pay for their condo and found himself on the street.   

'The more I talk to him, the more I sense how genuine he is…. I gave him my number and told him to call me when he needs help. Never judge a book by its cover. One love!' Paler Lin said.
