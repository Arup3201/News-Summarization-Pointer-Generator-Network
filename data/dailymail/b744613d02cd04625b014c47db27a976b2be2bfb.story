It might not be the most likely place to find a duchess.

But as Sarah Ferguson gathered in a huddle with dozens of schoolchildren around tennis star Novak Djokovic, who was busy planting trees, she looked entirely at ease.

The Duchess of York was in the small Serbian town of Kadina Luka, near Ljig, with the tennis champ as the two opened a new primary school for underprivileged local children.

She arrived in the early hours of Monday morning at Belgrade's Nikola Tesla Airport for a charitable visit with the Djokovic Foundation.

The two opened a refurbished primary school at 7am yesterday morning, after he met her in Belgrade.

The school, based in a small town in the centre of Serbia, is the first to have been 
renovated by the charity as part of its project Skolica Zivota (Little School Of Life).

And the charitable pair were not afriad to get their hands dirty. While Novak dug holes to plant saplings, the Duchess of York entertained the gaggle of children, keeping them in her thrall.

Despite the fact she can only have slept for an hour or two, the duchess kept smiling throughout the day.

Worthwhile cause: The duchess, who is a patron of the charitable foundation, insisted on flying in, saying it is 'not all about attending glittery parties'

Natural: Prince Andrew's former wife, who also enjoys a career as a writer and television personality, made an easy addition to the crew

Patron: The Novak Djokovic Humanitarian Foundation was founded in 2007 by the tennis champ and says its goal is to create a 'lasting change' in the lives of children in need in Serbia

Children's education is a cause close to the Duchess's heart.

She
 is an ambassador of the foundation and believes this 'means more than 
just going to glittery parties' and so wanted to see their work firsthand.

And her work, and that of Djokovic, is indeed vital: It is known that fewer than 44 per cent of children between three and a half and five actually attend school.

Prince Andrew's former wife opened the school with Djokovic and is currently on her way back to London.

While engaging in charitable work, she also enjoys a career as a writer and television personality.

Novak Djokovic beat Milos Raonic in 
straight sets yesterday, lifting Serbia to a 2-2 tie with Canada in the 
Davis Cup semi-finals.

The Novak Djokovic Humanitarian Foundation was founded in 2007 by the tennis champ.

Its
 goal is to create a lasting change in the lives of children in need in 
Serbia, and its work takes them to the most socially underprivileged 
communities in the country.

Tennis champion Novak Djokovic started his foundation in 2007

The Duchess put her best foot forward in a pair of snazzy slipper shoes from Pretty Ballerinas yesterday.

The black slip-ons feature a bright red heart detail and are made of leather and suede.

At Â£150, they may have the royal seal of approval but they don't come cheap.

But their low heels make them a comfortable choice for travelling in.
