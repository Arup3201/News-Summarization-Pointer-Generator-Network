Williams Gallas has announced his retirement from football. 

The former Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham and France defender calls time on a glittering career which saw him win two Premier League titles.

'It is not an easy thing to announce,' the 37-year-old said. 'You always tell yourself that you can keep going, but, I think today I cannot go on any longer.'

GOOD GALLAS 

An injury-time winner against Tottenham in 2006 saw Chelsea win 2-1. Jose Mourinho's men went on to win the Premier League.

Scoring in the fifth minute against Manchester United in a 3-0 win that saw Chelsea crowned Premier League champions in 2006.

Being named Arsenal captain in 2007 ahead of Gilberto Silva after one season.

BAD GALLAS

After controversially signing for Arsenal, Chelsea claimed Gallas threatened to deliberately score own goals if he was not allowed to leave Stamford Bridge.

Gallas, Arsenal's captain at the time, held a sit-down protest after drawing 2-2 against Birmingham put a dent in their title hopes.

Being stripped of his captaincy in 2008 after publicly criticising Arsenal players and saying the younger members should show courage.

Gallas, who started his professional career at Caen in 1995, won 84 caps for France and scored five goals, including the controversial strike in their 2-1 play-off win against Ireland that earned the side a 2010 World Cup berth.

Gallas poked the home from close range after being set up by Thierry Henry, who had clearly handled the ball to prevent it from going out of play. He also played the 2006 World Cup final which France lost on penalties to Italy.

After playing for Marseille from 1997-2001, Gallas left for England, joining Chelsea, where he won back-to-back Premier League titles in 2005 and 2006 and popped up with some important goals.

He moved to Arsenal in 2006 as part of the deal which took Ashley Cole to Stamford Bridge.

Possibly his most famous moment in a red shirt came at Birmingham in 2008 when he had a tantrum and held a solitary sit-down protest in the centre circle after the Gunners conceded a late goal to draw a match they should have won. It ultimately derailed their title bid.

Never one for the quiet life, he joined Tottenham  in 2010.

Last October, Gallas signed a one-year deal with Perth Glory in Australia's A-League, where veteran stars such as Alessandro Del Piero plied their trade.
