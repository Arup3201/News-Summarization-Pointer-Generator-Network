Missing: Brenna Kathleen Machus who has not been seen since her co-worker was shot dead in an apparent robbery at a Michigan store on Monday night

Detectives have appealed for help in trying to trace a missing shop assistant who they believe may have been abducted after her co-worker was shot dead.

Brenna Kathleen Machus hasn't been seen since her colleague, named in reports as Joseph Orlando, was killed at the Family Dollar store in Dearborn, Michigan, on Monday evening.

Police have have released CCTV footage of a man suspected of killing Mr Orlando and fear that 20-year-old Ms Machus may be in danger after they found her car parked outside the store, but no trace of her.

Dearborn Police Chief Ronald Haddad said: 'Our investigation in ongoing and all of our resources are currently being utilized to locate Ms Machus and identify and apprehend the perpetrator of this vicious crime.'

Mr Orlando's body was found on Tuesday morning after staff arrived at the store to open for the day and found the shop in disarray.

According to the Detroit Free Press, the suspect targeted the store's safe and cash drawer.

Surveilance cameras caught the suspect dressed in a dark hooded jacket, blue jeans and white shoes, as he entered the store at around 7.30pm on Monday.

The suspect, who appears to be a man, waves his hand at someone as he enters the store and is seen grabbing a shopping trolley.

Ms Machus's picture has been circulated on social networking websites and a Find Brenna Machus page set up on Facebook.

A message from Ms Machus's family posted on the page said: 'It haunts our minds to think of what she is going through.
