Camels are being blamed as being the source of MERS, a new SARS like disease sweeping across the Middle East

Camels are being blamed as the source of the deadly MERS virus, a SARS-like condition which is spreading through the Middle East. 

Researchers have warned it is not advisable to come into close contact with the animals, especially sick camels, as most are infected with the same strain of the virus as humans.

MERS, which stands for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome has already infected 345 people in Saudi Arabia since it was identified two years ago.

There has been further concern over the spread of the virus as Saudi Arabia has reported more cases over the weekend, taking the reported number of deaths to 100.

Symptoms include fever, pneumonia and sometimes kidney failure, with a third of all sufferers eventually being killed by the virus.

Yesterday, acting Saudi health minister Adel Fakieh told a news conference: 'There has been consensus in the discussions taking place over the last two days after the scientific team reviewed various evidence that it is advised not to get into close contact with camels, especially sick camels.'

He was speaking after meeting foreign experts including those from the World Health Organisation who were invited by the government to help investigate MERS. They have also advised people not to consume raw milk or raw meat products from camels.

A countrywide survey of camels in Saudi Arabia shows many, if not most, are infected with a strain genetically almost identical to the strain that’s infecting people, a team at Columbia University, King Saud University, and the EcoHealth Alliance reported.

Nasal swabs were taken from the animals who seem untroubled by it after researchers ran genetic test.

'Given these new data, we are now investigating potential routes for human infection through exposure to camel milk or meat products,” Abdulaziz Alagaili of King Saud University, who worked on the study, published in the journal mBio told NBC News.

But the WHO's latest advisory on MERS says that most people infected by the virus have it transmitted from another human rather than a camel.

Health experts are particularly concerned about the spread of MERS. In Saudi Arabia alone, there have been 345 reported cases and 100 deaths

The MERS virus was first discovered in 2012 when an elderly man from Saudi Arabia died from the virus.

It concerned health experts due to its similarity to the SARS virus, which has infected more than 8,000 people since 2003, with 800 deaths.

MERS has been detected in people in Middle Eastern countries such as Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, annd the United Arab Emirates.

Cases have also been confirmed in Europe too in countries such as the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Greece.  

MERS is of particular concern due to Saudi Arabia's role as host of Islam's annual haj pilgrimage which attracts millions to the kingdom each year

MERS is of particular concern due to Saudi Arabia's role as host of Islam's annual haj pilgrimage which attracts millions to the kingdom each year.

Mr Fakieh said very old people, children and those with chronic diseases should delay their pilgrimage, set for early October, this year, but that no other restrictions were being imposed.

Camels are a common sight in some eastern districts of the capital Riyadh, grazing on empty plots of land or carted in trucks on major roads.

While they are less prevalent inside some other Saudi cities, such as Jeddah, they are still often seen on town outskirts.
