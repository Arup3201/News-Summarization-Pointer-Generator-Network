A 72-year-old who still plays football every week is officially Britain’s oldest goalkeeper.

Colin Lee started playing football when he was just six years old and has now been regularly partaking in the beautiful game for an incredible 66 years.

The pensioner is secretary for eight teams in his home town of Northampton, including a veteran’s team which he also plays in each week.

He has just been awarded the Barclays Community Sports Award for his community football work.

Mr
Lee, who supports Wolverhampton, said: 'I’ve been told you have to be 
mad to be a goalie, so I guess I must be bordering on that as I’ve done 
it for so long.

'I like 
chucking myself around the goal like a lunatic. I’ve had lots of bruises
but amazingly I’ve never had any serious football injuries in nearly 70
years.'

Mr Lee began kicking a ball in the playground when he was six and joined his school team four years later.

He has since played for six teams, initially as a centre half and for the last five decades as a goalkeeper.

He said: 'When I first started playing I went in any position I could just to get a game. But since 1949 I have played in goal, I just really enjoy it.'

Mr Lee formed Thorplands Club 81, a Sunday League team with his workmates, after he left the RAF in 1974.

Since then he has established three additional adult teams, three youth teams and the RAF veterans’ team, which he founded to help older players exercise on a regular basis.

He said: 'I usually play at least 20 
minutes in a match but I like to play for longer if I can. I played a 
whole game a couple of weeks ago and I was creaking a bit afterwards.

'I have an exercise bike to keep fit at home between matches, which I use for 20 minutes a day and I do crunches on a bench.

'I still feel like a six-year-old boy at heart when I play, although my body tells me differently.'

Mr Lee, who has only ever had a knee injury and some bruises throughout his lengthy amateur football career, even has plans to start a second veteran’s team next year so he can play more matches.

He said: 'I want to continue playing football for as long as I can.'

Mr Lee's all-time football hero is Manchester United midfielder Ryan Giggs, and his top goalkeeper is Bert Williams, who played for England from 1949 to 1955.
