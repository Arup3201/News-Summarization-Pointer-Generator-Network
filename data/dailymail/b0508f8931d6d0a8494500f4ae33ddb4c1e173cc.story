Man's best friend has not been around for nearly as long as thought.

A new study claims that the remains of a supposed dog dating to 31,680 years ago actually belong to a wolf.

This brings the emergence of modern dogs forward by some 15,000 years.

3D analysis showed the skulls were in fact those of wolves - not the earliest dogs as claims in other studies 

The finding follows the reclassification of two fossil skulls, one more than 30,000 years old, that were the basis for dating dog domestication.

Researchers used 3D computer imaging to study the 31,680-year-old fossil found at Goyet Cave in Belgium, as well as a 13,905-year-old fossil found at a site called Eliseevichi in Russia near Lake Baikal.

Their results suggest both skulls were in fact those of wolves - not the earliest dogs as claimed in other studies.

This means that the earliest fossil evidence for domesticated dogs still dates to about 15,000 years ago - a time when humans started forming permanent settlements and farming, said the team. 

The team used scans and 3D visualisation software to study the shape and size of the two skulls and compare the data with measurements from the skulls of other dogs and wolves - both modern-day and ancient

'Scientists have been eager to put a collar on the earliest domesticated dog,' said biologist and study co-author Abby Drake of Skidmore College, New York.

'Unfortunately, their analyses weren't sensitive enough to accurately determine the identity of these fossils.'

It may come as no surprise to most dog owners, but canines became domesticated simply to make it easier to get food, researchers have said.

In a study last year, they found that the key difference between wolves and dogs is that centuries of eating human food has meant dogs possess genes for digesting starches, allowing them to thrive on a human diet.

The Swedish team say the dog's love of human food supports the idea that dogs became domesticated by lingering around human settlements.

While it’s possible that humans might have gone out to take wolf pups and domesticated them, it may have been more attractive for dogs to start eating from the scrap heaps as modern agriculture started,' said Kerstin Lindblad-Toh, a geneticist at Uppsala University in Sweden, who led the work.

Lindblad-Toh and her team catalogued the genetic changes involved in domestication by looking for differences between the genomes of 12 wolves and 60 dogs from 14 different breeds.

Their search identified 36 regions of the genome that set dogs apart from wolves, and the team believe these are the reason dogs are so much more friendly than wolves.

Drake and a team used scans and 3D visualisation software to study the shape and size of the two skulls and compare the data with measurements from the skulls of other dogs and wolves - both modern-day and ancient.

The same technology had previously been used to study human fossils, but never to identify members of the canid family, Drake told AFP.

It allowed the team to identify subtle morphological differences between dogs and wolves, such as the direction of the eye cavity and the angle between the muzzle and forehead.

'Our study provides a new and more accurate method for determining if a fossil is a wolf or a dog,' Drake said, adding the findings demonstrated that other measurements used until now 'are extremely inaccurate'.

'We were able to determine if a skull was from a dog or wolf with 96 per cent accuracy,' she said.

Many scientists believe that dog domestication started when ancient wolves started scavenging on waste dumps near human settlements.

The dog is estimated to have split from the wolf anything from 7,000 to 30,000 years ago.

It was a relatively short time ago, 200 years or so, that the first breeds were named and breed standards introduced, said Drake. Since then, 'we have seen an explosion in dog diversity.'

The dog was likely the first animal to be domesticated by man - a key step in the development of modern human civilisation.

'People are inherently interested in dogs and we have influenced their evolution,' Drake said of the motivation for the research.

'They are such a part of our lives. Knowing when domestication of dogs took place in the course of human history is important to our story and theirs.'
