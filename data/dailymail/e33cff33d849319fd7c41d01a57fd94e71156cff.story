A New York man has been arrested for allegedly conning desperate parents out of thousands of dollars by falsely promising to recover children who had been kidnapped and sold into child trafficking.

According to the FBI, Peter Senese, 49, ran a sham non-profit called the I CARE Foundation where he purported he could reunite families with their children. 

In one particular incident, the alleged fraudster and pathological liar collected roughly $60,000 from a New York client whose child was abducted to India.

However, the youngster was reportedly never recovered. Senese now faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted of wire fraud.

He was arrested on Tuesday morning near his home in Brooklyn with his first court appearance due later that day.

According to a Facebook fan page, Senese established the I CARE Foundation in 2011.

However, a Tampa Bay Times article, alleges that Senese was already active in the child abduction business and operating as a 'master con' in May 2010.

He went on to promote his group through the websites www.stopchildabduction.org and www.petersenese.com. He also built a presence on social media via Twitter and YouTube.

According to the complaint, Senese told potential clients that he could recover children using former soldiers he knew from his days as a member of the U.S. Army's Delta Force. 

'In fact, he could do no such thing, but that didn't stop him from allegedly repeatedly reaching out to the parents for more money to fund his non-existent rescue mission,' U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement.

In the India case, which took place in November 2013, Senese apparently claimed he had traveled to the country to seek out the perpetrators. 

He then sent several emails and text messages falsely assuring the family that the child's rescue was only days or even hours away.

Documents also say he demanded more money to cover expenses - usually $3,000 to $5,000 a month.

But investigators found that when Senese claimed he was overseas, he was really in New York, Miami or Los Angeles and hadn't traveled outside of the U.S. since 2007.

They also found no records showing he was ever in the military and that I CARE was registered as a non-profit. 

There was also a second victim allegedly swindled out of $5,000 but Senese dropped the client after they wanted to arrange a meeting with an attorney.

The name of Senese's attorney wasn't immediately available.
