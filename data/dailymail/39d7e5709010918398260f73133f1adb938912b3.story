A 10-year-old boy has told of the terrifying moment he was bowled over by a hit-and-run driver while playing in the street with friends.

Brendan O'Connor-Bowden was crossing the road near his home in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, when a turquoise Honda Civic crashed into him.

Despite flinging him to the ground, the 
motorist kept on driving, leaving the boy slumped in the road in front 
of shocked witnesses.

'Lucky': Brendan Connor-Bowden, 10, pictured with his mother Katrina, was struck while he played on the street with friends outside his home in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester

Incredibly, the 10-year-old suffered only minor injuries, but police have warned that the collision could have been fatal.

Brendan,
 a pupil at Holy Trinity Church of England Primary School, said that he 
has suffered sleepless nights after being struck on 2 September.

He
 said: 'Everytime I close my eyes I keep seeing the car. I completely 
blacked out when it happened. I can't remember anything.

'All
 I know is I was playing out with my friends and the next thing I know I
 am on the floor crying with loads of people around me.'

Brendan's mother Katrina, 31, said if the driver had been going any faster, he would have killed her son.

The mother-of-three said: 'I just hope the police find who did this because we are the lucky ones really. The next person they hit might not be so lucky.'

'Sleepless nights': Brendan was lucky to walk away with only minor injuries but said that he relives the moment of the crash every time he closes his eyes

The dinner lady, who works at Holy Trinity Church of England Primary School said she feared the worst when her neighbour's children rushed to her door to tell her Brendan had been hit.

She
 said: 'It looks like the driver deliberately went for Brendan, but even
 if it was an accident, why didn't they stop to help him or check if he 
was ok?'

'When
 I heard the knock at my door I knew something awful had happened and I 
just panicked. I don't let Brendan play out on the streets after 7pm 
anymore because you just don't know what kind of people are out there.'

Police have 
now released the footage in the hope of tracking down the driver, who 
they say showed a 'worrying level of apathy and regard' for the young 
boy's welfare.  

Pc
 Adrian Spurrel said: 'The CCTV is crystal clear. The driver collided 
with a young boy then callously drove off, leaving him slumped in the 
road. 

'Remarkably
 he only missed one day of school after suffering minor injuries, but 
clearly the injuries could have been far worse or even fatal.

'To
 leave a young boy shocked and injured in the road when you have no idea
 how seriously injured he may or may not be shows a worrying level of 
apathy and regard for his welfare, and I need the public's help to 
identify the driver.

'If you know the driver or have information about them or the car, please call us.

'Perhaps
 someone you know has a similar car, came home in a state of shock or 
has been acting differently since the accident. If so I want to hear 
from you.

'I would also invite the driver to come forward now and talk to us of their own volition.'

The
 incident took place in Victoria Street shortly after 7.15pm on 
September 2. The Honda Civic is believed to have been manufactured 
between 1991 and 1996.

Anyone with information should phone police on 0161 856 8473.

Appeal: Police have asked anyone with information on the Honda Civic, pictured driving away from Brendan (circled), to come forward. The vehicle is believed to have been manufactured between 1991 and 1996
