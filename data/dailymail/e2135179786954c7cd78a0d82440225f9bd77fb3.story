Two men have been charged with child rape offences after a huge police raid by police investigating sex abuse in a Buckinghamshire town.

Harmohan Nangpal, 40, and Faisal Iqbal, 31, will both appear before magistrates today charged in connection with alleged child exploitation around Aylesbury. 

Nangpal, of Hayes, Middlesex, is accused of raping a girl under 13, while Iqbal, of Aylesbury, faces one count of conspiracy to rape a girl under 16.

Accused: Two men have been charged with child rape after a huge police raid by police investigating sex abuse in a Buckinghamshire town

Police said the pair were arrested over alleged offences committed in the Aylesbury area between 2005 and 2008.

Last Tuesday police carried out a series of synchronised dawn raids, in which up to 120 officers stormed 11 properties across Buckinghamshire and Middlesex.

Following the raids, eight other men, aged between 28 and 45, were charged in connection with alleged child sex exploitation following the raids as part of Operation Articulate.

Police said the raids had been prompted by information received 'earlier this year', and related to two female victims with the alleged abuse carried out between 2005 and 2012. 

Speaking after last week's raids, Acting Superintendent Olly Wright said: 'The police action taken today comes as a result of information given to the police earlier this year. We have been working closely with other agencies to investigate these matters, and to provide support and care for the victims.

'The aim of this operation is to protect victims, bring offenders to justice, and to offer help to any others who we are encouraging to come forward. We will continue to work alongside our partner agencies to offer any support victims need as we carry on with the investigation.'

Officers said they were not linked to recent high profile sex cases in Rotherham and Oxford. 

Nangpal and Iqbal have been remanded to appear at Milton Keynes Magistrates’ Court later today.
