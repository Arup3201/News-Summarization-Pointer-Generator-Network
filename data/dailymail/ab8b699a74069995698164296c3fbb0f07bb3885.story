A dog is dead and two people are being questioned by authorities after a pickup truck drove onto a frozen river in New Jersey and sunk. 

The truck, which was driven onto Toms River near Pine Beach last night, was recovered this morning by search and rescue teams from the New Jersey State Police and US Coast Guard.

Two people voluntarily turned themselves in and they are being questioned about the incident.

The United States Coast Guard Mid-Atlantic division provided this aerial shot of the scene in Pine Beach, New Jersey. A dead dog was recovered after a pickup trunk sunk in Toms River last night 

A dead boxer mix was found in the truck, but no people were found inside of the submerged pickup

The search and rescue effort for the truck involved crew members wearing 'ice rescue' suits and 'fan boats'

Authorities were alerted about the truck after a witness reported seeing it doing 'donuts' after driving onto the river around midnight last night.

Before the truck hit the ice, a male passenger was seen getting out. 

A helicopter crew spotted a hole in the ice this morning and the truck was found approximately 100 feet from shore, NJ Advance Media reported. 

No people were found in the submerged pickup, but a dead boxer mix was found inside.  

Toms River police wrote on Facebook: 'Police units responded and also observed the vehicle on the ice. 

'The headlight and brake lights could be seen from the shoreline as the vehicle headed South and West towards the other side of the river. 

'After a period of time went by the lights suddenly were no longer visible.

'Fearing that the truck broke through the ice, search teams were activated.'

The rescue effort involved crew members wearing 'ice rescue' suits and using 'fan boats'. 

The New Jersey State Police Marine Unit and the Pine Beach Police Department are continuing to investigate.
