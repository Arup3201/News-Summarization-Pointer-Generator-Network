It has been quite the year for model and society girl Cara Delevingne.

Already the face of Tom Ford, Burberry, Topshop, Mulberry and Chanel, the 22-year-old Brit was unveiled as the star of YSL's latest beauty campaign last week amid news that she reportedly earned over £2million this year alone. 

But it seems that despite her massive success as a model, she is going to be focusing her attention much more on her burgeoning acting career than the catwalk next year.

It looks like we will be seeing more of Cara on the big screen and on stage next year  

Cara recently starred in the film The Face of an Angel with Daniel Bruhl 

Speaking to Vogue Cara said that she will be spending more time on thespian endeavors and singing.

She cited her Christmas wish as: 'More time to be creative and to write music, to work on my acting, and more time to spend with friends and family and my nephew Atticus'.

In fact, despite being on nearly every billboard in the run up to Christmas, Cara is already taking a break from modelling. 

'I'm working in America preparing for my scenes in a new film - very excited!' she told the magazine. 

Cara  is to star in the upcoming John Green adaptation of 2008's Paper Towns.

She is said to be appearing alongside Hollywood heavyweights Hugh Jackman, who will play Blackbeard, and Amanda Seyfried – who both starred in Les Miserables in 2012, as well as Rooney Mara.

During the Vogue interview Cara also opened up about her much talked about campaign with fellow supermodel Kate Moss, 40, who she is often compared to.

The pair appear together in Burberry's latest fragrance campaign dressed in just the brand's iconic trench coats.

Cara said of the campaign: 'The shoot with Kate has to be one of my favourites. It was relaxed and easy and really was us being us, which meant Mario was able to get some amazing natural shots.'

Cara described the sultry black and white campaign for Burberry as one of her favourites ever 

Starring in campaigns like YSL's latest beauty ad has helped Cara earn over £2 million this year

Campaigns like these mean that Cara boasted £1.1m of cash in the bank this year and was owed a further £1.3m from modelling deals, figures revealed.

The debut set of figures are the first-ever marker of the young model’s incredible earning power.

The accounts come as the award-winning youngster was also unveiled as the face of Topshop’s Christmas collection.

The accounts, filed at Companies House by her firm Cara & Co, cover the 12 months to the end of January this year.

However, her huge personal wealth won't stop the model from enjoying a simple family Christmas this year. 

Describing her best childhood memories of the festive period, she recalls cooking the families secret gravy recipes together and sharing a bed with her sisters Chloe and Poppy, 'laughing into the night together.'
