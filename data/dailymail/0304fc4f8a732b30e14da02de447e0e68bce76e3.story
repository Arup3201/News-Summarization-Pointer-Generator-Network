Boris Johnson claimed shadow chancellor Ed Balls has the look of a man undergoing an 'unexpected prostate examination' in an extraordinary speech to Tory fundraisers.

The Mayor of London stunned the room of Conservative party members with the comments, which he made at a fundraiser in Nottingham, East Midlands.

During the event, he also told the 70-strong crowd that Mr Balls and Labour leader Ed Miliband were the 'Thelma and Louise of British politics'.

He told the bemused crowd: 'The Thelma and Louise of British politics, Ed Miliband and Ed Balls.

'Does anybody really want to give them back keys to the British economy?

'Do you? Do you want Ed Miliband in charge when frankly he doesn't know.

'He's a stupefying man.

'Do you want Ed Balls in charge of the economy with his unbelievably hostile attitude towards wealth creation and the terrible, pop-eyed air of a man undergoing an unexpected prostate examination?

'Is that what you want? Do you want these guys in charge?

'I don't want them in charge.'

The Conservative was in the East Midlands last Thursday to host fundraisers for prospective Nottingham South candidate Jane Hunt, and also for Sherwood MP Mark Spencer.

Elliot Johnson, Nottingham University Conservative Association campaigns officer, was at the presentation at the city's Goosedale conference and banqueting suites, and said Mr Johnson was better than any stand-up comedian.

The 21-year-old third-year history student said: 'He gave such a fantastic speech.

The London Mayor also described Mr Balls and Labour leader Ed Miliband (above) as the 'Thelma and Louise of British politics' and asked: 'Does anybody really want to give them back keys to the British economy?'

'There were some really funny lines, especially the finger up the bum part. He is a very very good orator. Boris can just get away with saying stuff that nobody else can. 

'Afterwards, about 70 people gave him a standing ovation for more than a minute-and-a-half.

'He's the best public speaker I've ever seen.'

It is also understood that Mr Johnson quipped that, since London will soon become the fourth-biggest 'French' city in the world - due to a huge number of French people living there - it is in danger of being invaded by Germany.

According to student newspaper The Tab, he said: 'We're bigger than Nantes, We're bigger than Strasbourg, if it goes much longer like this we'll have to worry about a German invasion.

'We even have a family of Huguenot refugees from France living in Dulwich, called Monsieur and Madame Farage.'

The Labour Party and the Conservative Party both refused to comment on Mr Johnson's speech.
