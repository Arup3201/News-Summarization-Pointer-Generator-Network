Smuggler: Russian guards show a cat which they caught on a clandestine mission at the Komi prison

Prison inmates been known to bribe guards so they can smuggle in mobile phones.

But - for the second time in five months - a cat appears to have been used as an accomplice.

Guards patrolling a prison colony in Russia's north saw a cat on the fence that was apparently carrying something.

On a closer look, they found two mobile phones and chargers taped to the male cat's belly.

The federal prison service said the incident happened last Friday evening at Penal Colony No 1 near the city of Syktyvkar in Komi province, 600 miles north-east of Moscow.

It was not immediately clear how the cat was supposed to drop off its loot.

A spokesman for the jail said: ‘Two packages were taped to the animal’s back.

‘When the packages were unwrapped, guards found objects prohibited in the penitentiary facility - two cell phones with batteries and chargers.

'Obviously we can’t question the cat, but someone somewhere knows who he was delivering these items to and we will hold him until we find out.’

It follows an incident in north-east Brazil in January when a cat carrying a saw and mobile phone was 'detained' as it entered a prison gate.

Brazil incident: A cat carrying a saw and a mobile phone was 'detained' in January as it entered a prison gate at the jail in Arapiraca city, in the state of Alagoas

Guards at the jail in Arapiraca city, in
the state of Alagoas, were surprised when they saw a white cat crossing
the main gate of the prison, with its body wrapped with tape.

A closer look showed the feline also carried drills, an earphone, a memory card, batteries and a phone charger.

'It's tough to find out who's responsible for the action as the cat doesn't speak,' a prison spokesman said following the incident on New Year's Day.
