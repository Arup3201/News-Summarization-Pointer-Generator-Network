A lonely teenager admitted posting vile remarks about missing five-year-old April Jones on Facebook - but then claimed he only made the comments to get attention.

Sam Busby, 18, shocked fellow Facebook users by writing a string of offensive comments about the Welsh girl who is presumed dead.

The remarks caused one user to label him a 'class A idiot' while another contacted police and said she felt the comments could cause distress to April’s family.

Obscene: Busby pleaded guilty to using a public communication network to send a message that was grossly offensive

Call centre worker Busby yesterday admitted making the remarks on October 6 - the day Mark Bridger was charged with April’s murder just five days after she went missing from her home in Machynlleth, Powys, Wales.

Her body has never been found despite extensive searches.

The teen pleaded guilty at Worcester Magistrates Court to using a public communication network to send a message that was grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character.

'Class A idiot': Fellow Facebook users contacted police after viewing Busby's comments

But Busby, who  told magistrates he was just 'looking for attention' when he made the 'very unpleasant' comments.

Matt Dodson, prosecuting, told the court Busby’s Facebook page could be viewed by anyone, the court heard.

During a police interview read out in court he told officers he thought his page could only be viewed by friends but admitted a couple of comments had come from people he did not know.

Busby then told police he was just 'an immature teenager who wanted to get some attention'.

Belinda Ariss, defending, said: 'The facts are very unpleasant. Mr Busby is deeply ashamed and has deleted the comments and deactivated his Facebook account.

'He’s very sorry and made a full admission to police.'

She explained he had been so ashamed of the comments that he asked his parents, who were supporting him, to stay out of the courtroom.

She added: 'They don’t know the comments he has made but they know the messages are very bad.'

Busby has no previous convictions and works full time.

Chairman of the bench Gerald Heath adjourned sentencing until November 7. Busby, from St Johns, Worcester, was released on conditional bail.
