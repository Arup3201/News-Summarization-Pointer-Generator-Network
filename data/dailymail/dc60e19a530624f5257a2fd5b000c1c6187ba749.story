Southampton are planning a £70million spree over the coming days to replace their 'lost boys.'

And the Saints will keep tabs on some of the players Manchester United are prepared to let go as they reshape their squad. 

The south coast club want United’s Mexican striker Javier Hernandez and either Wilfried Zaha or Ashley Young, depending on which winger Louis van Gaal is prepared to sell.

Target: Wilfried Zaha (right) is also attracting the attention of Southampton this pre-season

But they 
will have to act fast if they want to land Zaha the player having agreed
 'terms' with three clubs QPR, West Ham and former club Palace.

New
 Saints boss Ronald Koeman has also targeted Dutch duo Ron Vlaar of 
Aston Villa and Celtic’s Virgil van Dijk, while Celtic goalkeeper Fraser
 Forster  is another target.

The
 problem for Southampton is that other clubs will hike up their transfer
 fees knowing the Saints have banked £100m by selling five first-team 
players.

Manchester United will this week attempt to complete the signing of German defender Mats Hummels.

But United will have to up their original offer of £17m to nearly £25m if they are to force German club Borussia Dortmund to sell.

The Red Devils also want to force through the capture of Arturo Vidal from Juventus, while the situation regarding PSG striker Edinson Cavani remains in the balance. 

United have trailed Cavani for a long time, even before Van Gaal arrived, but the Uruguay striker keeps sending out mixed messages about his future.

That is perhaps because Chelsea’s interest in the striker re-surfaced last week even though Jose Mourinho has said he has completed transfer business.

Manchester bound? Borussia Dortmund defender Mats Hummels could be heading to United for £25m

West Ham may try to lure Peter Crouch to Upton Park from Stoke.

With Andy Carroll possibly sidelined for four months, the 33-year-old could be seen as a like-for-like replacement. 

Ideally the Hammers would want the striker on loan, but Stoke would prefer to sell Crouch for a fee of £1m and clear his £45,000-a-week wages off their books.

West Ham, who continued their busy summer of dealings by bringing in Carl Jenkinson from Arsenal on a season-long loan, may consider that as decent business.

Arsenal will make one more bid for German midfielder Sami Khedira this week.

But the Real Madrid player, who is valued at around £30m, could disappoint Arsene Wenger by opting for a move to Bayern Munich.

Should that happen, then Wenger could turn his attention to another German midfielder - Bayer Leverkusen's Lars Bender. 

Wenger has also insisted he wants to keep Joel Campbell at the club now he is back from his loan spells, but AC Milan have also shown an interest in taking the Costa Rican for a year.

London call: Sami Khedira could yet join Arsenal but also has the option of a return to Germany with Bayern

Crystal Palace, who have already completed some astute business this summer, are now on the trail of Swansea’s Jonjo Shelvey.

But Shelvey's former club Liverpool are also considering making a move for a Swansea player, striker Wilfried Bony.

Liverpool's move comes after their bid to sign Loic Remy from QPR for £8m collapsed. 

Rangers boss Harry Redknapp, meanwhile, has recommended to the QPR board to offer Remy a new contract and double his wages to around £70,000 a week.

But the France striker is reluctant to sign a new deal with Rangers because it would change the release clauses in his contract.

However, if no club comes in for Remy before the end of the transfer window - Newcastle have yet to make an expected move - the forward may  renegotiate with the newly-promoted west London side.

Redknapp will argue to the club they will be getting a top-class striker who is already on their books for 'free' and that if Remy's goals keep QPR in the Premier League then the increase in wages would easily be covered.

On the move? Jonjo Shelvey could leave Swansea and join Tony Pulis at Crystal Palace

I am hearing

German club Wolfsburg, who were beaten by Everton in their bid to sign Romelu Lukaku, have now turned their attentions to Manchester United's Japanese playmaker Shinji Kagawa.

Libero

While many  Premier League clubs have been trotting the globe ahead of the new campaign, Barcelona opted to travel to Burton in the East Midlands and work out at  St George’s Park - the FA's £100m complex - ahead of their pre-season European tour.

'The facilities are amazing, and everybody has been very impressed with the welcome we have received at St George's Park,' Spain forward Pedro said. 'The training is fantastic, the rooms are excellent and the weather is ideal to train in every day.

'Being able to stay here and not going abroad, for example to the States, is better because the team can train better, train twice a day and at the end of the day, that will benefit us physically and tactically.'

Pass masters: Barcelona made use of the facilities at St George's Park as past of their pre-season preparation

You couldn’t make it up really. The great Catalan club come to England for the facilities and weather while English clubs go all around the world.

But then, as Louis van Gaal has already identified, the pre-season schedules of England's top clubs like Manchester United have more to do with commercial interests than getting the team in the right condition, which is clearly the priority of  Barcelona.

That said, after years of planning and over £100m spent in building a training centre to improve the grass roots as well as provide top-class facilities for England teams, St George’s Park would seem to have commercial interests rather high on the agenda.

If the place is about improving all levels of the English game, why is it being hired out to foreign teams?

At a time when school holidays are on, the management of St George’s Park opted to take a lucrative booking from Barcelona.

Close to home: English sides have flown to American while Barcelona were content to stay in Europe

A few weeks back it was Romanian side Steaua Bucharest  who were the 'customers'. Over the last years, many foreign clubs and countries have trained in Burton.

No doubt there are some decent coaching courses held, but it seems St George’s Park has become pre-occupied with commercial considerations rather than fulfilling the purpose for which it was built, and replicating French model of Claire Fontaine.

Back Heel

It wasn’t so long ago that pre-season was often about players losing excess baggage put on in the summer, but it would seem that Newcastle’s Hatem Ben Arfa has been maintaining the old tradition.

Ripped black bin liners under shirts was one method of sweating off the pounds back in the day before special diets, gyms, saunas and ice baths made their way into training grounds.

Going down to the coast and running in sand was also a favoured method of restoring muscle strength - indeed, I see Chelsea have installed their own sand running track at Cobham.

But this footage  from 1935 shows how West Ham limbered up for that season in a very basic way and also tested a novel ideal to stop conceding goals - by training with THREE keepers. 

BTW

On the subject of West Ham, how bizarre the position of manager Sam Allardyce has seemingly been stabilised as a consequences of Ravel Morrison being arrested for alleged assault and put in custody on remand.

But, even if Allardyce is in charge at the start of the season, he will have 10 games at the most to stay there. This time around, a bad start will spell the sack for Big Sam. I’m sure he is aware of it but whether he changes his game plan to lighten things up at the club remains to be seen.

But there will be one of obvious change in the club’s style this season. West Ham have ditched traditional claret and blue shirts for an all claret top.

So while for some they have been playing like Bolton under Sam in recent reasons they will look like Burnley.

Y-Factor

Why, having explained he didn’t want to upset Chelsea fans by spending a few months on loan at QPR is Frank Lampard poised to warm up for move to the MLS with New York City 'on loan' with their parent club Manchester City ?

Maybe it was part of the deal... but it will be interesting to hear what Jose Mourinho has to say on the matter of Lampard playing for one of Chelsea’s main title rivals.

I-Say

Mon: Steven Gerrard admits the last three months have been the worst of his career after that Title slip then his errors in England’s World Cup debacle. Gerrard has the character to bounce back for Liverpool straight away though.

Tues: West Ham co owner David Gold having favourited a Twitter message which condemned manager Sam Allardyce then blamed jet lag for the 'mistake': To be fair, we’ve all been there.

Weds: Chelsea say they will subsidise travel and tickets for fans travelling to away games. Nice action.

Thurs: Jonny Evans who has impressed on Manchester United's tour to the States could become a surprise contender to become club captain. Could be an inspired choice to get around the Rooney–RVP issue.

Fri : Andros Townsend is reported as saying Tottenham should forget about aiming for a top four finish. Even if he has a point, hardly an inspiring message to send out to long suffering Spurs fans before a ball has been kicked.
