These rather fetching strap-on hats are taking the sea by storm after this group of seal pups wore them out in the Pacific Ocean last night.

High-tech yet affordable, the easy-to-wear headpieces have become talk of the deep ... and probably aren't much more than an-tenner.

But not only are they the height of sea-life style, with their blinking lights and wobbly transmitter rods, but they also tell marine biologists exactly where you are at all times.

Does my blubber look big in this? These rather fetching strap-on hats are taking the sea by storm after this group of seal pups wore them out in the Pacific Ocean last night

Three lucky seal pups - called Oberon, Polaris and Pan - were chosen as the first to showcase the hats underwater by scientists at Vancouver Aquarium in Canada.

The seals were rescued by the aquarium's mammal rescue centre, nursed back to health and released back into the sea at Porteau Cove today.

The transmitters will provide data about the seals travel patterns and progress following their release, contributing to a greater understanding of their species and ecosystem

The transmitters will provide data about the seals travel patterns and progress following their release, contributing to a greater understanding of their species and ecosystem. 

The data is even open to the public, who are invited to watch their progress on the aquarium's website via an interactive map. 

According to the centre's mission statement, the 'primary goal of the Marine Mammal Rescue Centre is to provide housing and care for ill, injured, or abandoned marine mammals.'

Each year, the it rescues over 100 marine mammals and rehabilitates them for release back into their natural habitat.
