The French Football League (LFP) is yet to decide whether or not former Newcastle playmaker Hatem Ben Arfa can sign for Nice.

The 27-year-old is keen to join the Ligue 1 club as a free agent after his Newcastle contract was cancelled earlier this month, but could be prevented by FIFA rules which state a player cannot play for more than two clubs in the same season.

Ben Arfa's appearance for Newcastle Under-21s on August 25, before moving on loan to Hull, was considered an official match by FIFA.

Hatem Ben Arfa remains in limbo over his Nice debut with the French Football League stalling on a decision

Nice are seeking to push the deal through before Friday's meeting with Marseille and were hopeful the LFP would rule in their favour this week after receiving Ben Arfa's international transfer certificate from the English Football Association via the French Football Federation.

The LFP's legal committee did meet with Nice chief executive Julien Fournier and Ben Arfa's advisor Jean-Jacques Bertrand on Tuesday morning, but proceedings have been stayed for the time being.

A statement published on Nice's official website read: 'There is no decision today regarding approval for Hatem Ben Arfa's contract.

'The France international, who remains in Nice training for the derby (against Marseille) with his team-mates, is in a state of limbo.

'The League would like the international federation (FIFA) to express an official position before it makes its decision. To that end, the LFP has asked the FFF to communicate with FIFA's Player Status Committee.'

Ben Arfa played for Hull City during an ill-fated loan spell earlier this season as well as Newcastle Under-21s

The French play-maker struggled to hit form at Hull and had his loan deal ended prematurely by The Tigers

On Sunday Ben Arfa admitted his frustration over the stalled move on Nice's website.

'I do not understand why they would try to stop me from playing in France, my home, and say I should be in England or somewhere else,' he said. 'Why always try to create problems when there are none?

'I have only one desire - to play again on the pitches of Ligue 1, to have fun with my team-mates, and to give pleasure to the fans who have welcomed me as ever.'
