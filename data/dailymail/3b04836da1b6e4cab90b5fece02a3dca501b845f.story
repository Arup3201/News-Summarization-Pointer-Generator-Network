Nearly a century before the first high-rise made its mark on Hong Kong's skyline, a Scottish photographer took these amazing photos of the Far East city.

John Thomson, from Edinburgh, was one of the first Western photographers to travel to the region, documenting the people, landscapes and artefacts of eastern cultures in the 1860s.

An album of his incredible pictures, which he took around 150 years ago, sold at auction today for nearly £50,000.

An album of photographs of Hong Kong taken in the 1860s, which show the country's famous waterfront before dozens of high-rises were built, has sold for nearly £50,000

Modern Hong Kong: The now-booming financial hub looks like another world compared to how it appeared in the 1860s

A picture of the Happy Valley race course was part of the 38-image set, taken by Scottish photographer John Thomson, which sold at Christie's in London today

Mr Thomson gave the album to William Thomas Mercer, who had retired as Hong Kong's Colonial Secretary, and the photographs have been passed down through his family since

The pioneering photographer presented the album to fellow Scot William Thomas Mercer, of Gorthie, Perth, who had retired from his position as Hong Kong's Colonial Secretary, in 1868. 

Among the 38 prints are images of the Happy Valley race course, Victoria Peak, street and garden views, Chinese shop fronts, villagers and the famous dragon procession as well as portraits of Mr Mercer's pony, named Tommy.

The album, which has been passed through Mr Mercer's family, went under the hammer at Christie's in London, where it was snapped up by an anonymous bidder for £47,500.

Nick Lambourn, head of topographical pictures at Christie's, said: 'John Thomson was the most important pioneer photographer in Asia, and is celebrated in Hong Kong.

'This rare presentation album was a gift to commemorate the end of Mercer's service in Hong Kong.

'Thomson has captured some of the first pictures of these landscapes and people, and a glimpse of a Hong Kong mostly unseen by modern visitors - a long gone world.'

The incredible photo album sold for £47,500 today after spending nearly 150 years in the Mercer family

The pictures give a rare insight into what life in Hong Kong was like before it became a global financial hub

The album was sold alongside a scrapbook (pictured), which shows Mr Mercer (right, standing next to his wife), who was Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong from 1854 to 1868

Mr Mercer travelled to Hong Kong in the 1840s before working his way up to the position of Administrator of the colony

He added: 'Thomson is important internationally in the history of photography. He was among the first to travel to the Far East when he went to Singapore, then Penang (in Malaysia) and Hong Kong.

'Around the same time, his fellow Scot Mercer retired as colonial secretary. An album was the perfect souvenir.' 

The Thomson album, accompanied by Mr Mercer's family scrapbook, was one of two sold at Christie's by descendants of the family.

Another, including early photographs of India, where both Mr Mercer's father George Dempster Mercer and younger brother Charles McWhirter Mercer served, fetched £6,875.

Hong Kong was occupied by the British Empire in 1841, during the First Opium War between the Brits and the Chinese. 

After the Chinese lost the war, Hong Kong was handed over as part of the Treaty of Nanking - officially making it a British colony.

The end of the Opium War allowed Hong Kong to blossom as a port for the rest of the world to trade with China.

Opium dealers and merchants would travel from Europe and the Americas to do business with liberalised Chinese traders.

There were only around 8,000 people on Hong Kong island at this point, but within 25 years this had surged to 125,000 as thousands fled a bloody civil war in China.

Further treaties throughout the 19th century saw hundreds of nearby islands and inland territory ceded to the British Empire, including the 1898 convention which gave Britain rule over Hong Kong until 1997. 

It also included early views of Penang and Singapore also by John Thomson, who had established his first studios in the east in Penang in 1862, and Singapore in 1863.

Hong Kong had been captured from the Chinese by the British earlier in the 1800s and had established itself as a crucial trading station for British colonial and commercial interests in east Asia.

The period in the 19th century saw Hong Kong and its population grow considerably, and Scots were quick to realise the commercial and social opportunities to be had.

While Thomson, the son of an Edinburgh tobacco spinner, went on to become a portrait photographer in London.

The Mercers were distinguished by their service in British colonial history in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Members of the family were prominent in military campaigns, civil administration and commerce in the Americas, Australia, India and the Far East.

Mr Mercer arrived in Hong Kong in 1844 as private secretary to his uncle, Sir John Davis, the second governor of Hong Kong (1844-48), and was Colonial Treasurer from 1845-48, Colonial Secretary 1854-68 and Administrator 1865-66.

Mr Lambourn added: 'The Mercer family were emblematic of the Scots who built the Empire. Several members were very distinguished characters in the history of the colonies and Empire.

'They were in Asia, south-east Asia and India. Other members of the family were in Australia in the very early days, and negotiating land purchases in Tasmania.

'While another, Colonel James Mercer, was commander of the British forces at Oswego in the French and Indian Wars in America during the 1750s, and was killed by the French defending that fort.

'These albums give a glimpse in to their activities.'
