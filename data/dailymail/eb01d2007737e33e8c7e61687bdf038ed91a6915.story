A California school will have to apologise to an 11-year-old boy after a teacher reprimanded him over his religious beliefs when he refused to stand during the Pledge of Allegiance.

Ivan Cobarrubias kept his seat for several days during the morning pledge because the words 'under God' in the pledge violate his atheist beliefs.

A teacher at Monte Vista Middle School in San Jacinto, 85 miles east of Los Angeles, questioned his actions, causing him upset.

The seventh-grader complained to his mother, who contacted the Washington, D.C.-based American Humanist Association (AHA), a nonprofit group that takes up the cause of atheists, the Riverside Press-Enterprise reported.

Following the organisations actions on the matter, the San Jacinto Unified School District will now have to apologise to Ivan and his family.

The school admitted that it was possible the teacher 'went beyond necessary and appropriate inquiry' with his original questioning, Mark Thompson, whose law firm represents the school district, wrote in a letter to AHA.  

Thompson added that 'everyone seemed to agree that there was no hostility or failure of polite respectful demeanor' when the teacher questioned Ivan about why he did not want to stand for the pledge

The teacher never threatened to discipline Ivan and, after researching the matter, agreed with the boy that he had the right to remain seated, the letter said.

An apology will be delivered to the boy and his family next week, Mr Thompson added. 

In addition to the apology, a banner that read 'Prayer Changes Things' has been removed from the teacher's classroom, the letter said.

The boy's mother told the Press-Enterprise she was happy with the outcome.

'I see it as a victory,' Sandra Covarrubias said. 'When I read the letter, I was very happy.'

San Jacinto, a city of 45,000, is 85 miles east of Los Angeles.
