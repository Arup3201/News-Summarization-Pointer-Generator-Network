Chris Train said that in order to receive the 'luxury' of electricity, customers would have to pay for billions of pounds worth of infrastructure

A power boss sparked uproar yesterday by saying the amount of electricity families in Britain use is a ‘luxury’.

The extraordinary claim by Chris Train, a senior director of the National Grid, coincided with energy companies refusing to rule out more price rises.

Mr Train warned that providing ‘the luxury of electricity that we desire’ would mean customers paying billions more to upgrade the power network.

His comments – described as ‘hugely misjudged’ by critics – came as the Big Six energy firms made a mockery of the Government’s latest attempt to bring down bills.

Ministers unveiled measures which they promised would take £50 off the average bill. But power firms will not pass on the savings until deep into the winter months, leaving customers paying higher rates over Christmas.

And despite trimming their tariffs, every major supplier yesterday left the door open for another crippling increase.

It left Energy Secretary Ed Davey forced into the embarrassing admission that despite the £50 cut in green levies that energy firms have to pay, he was unable to promise that bills will not rise again.

Mr Train made his comments when he was asked about the security of Britain’s energy supplies.

Critics accused him of being ‘out of touch’ with the struggles ordinary families face in paying their bills. Labour energy spokesman Tom Greatrex said: ‘It’s a hugely misjudged comment.

‘Electricity is not a luxury. The reality is it’s hard for all but a handful of people to live without it.

‘If parts of the energy sector can’t understand that then little wonder that public anger over energy is the way that it is.’

Ann Robinson, director at price comparison site uSwitch, said: ‘To use the word luxury was misguided.

Despite protests over sky-high bills last week, energy companies have refused to rule out yet more price rises

‘That’s a very unfortunate was of describing something that’s absolutely essential to keeping the lights on.’

Family power bills have doubled in recent years as most have seen their incomes squeezed.

Recent figures suggest 33,000 people will die from the cold in Britain this winter – many of them elderly and vulnerable.

Subsidies
for wind farms and solar panels could face the axe after Energy 
Minister Michael Fallon said it was ‘immoral’ to pin the cost on 
taxpayers.

The average household pays £30 a year for large-scale renewable schemes. They are the second biggest green levy on bills, after insulation schemes – which the Government has just cut.

But subsidies often go to landowners who rake in thousands of pounds a year from green energy.

Mr Fallon said wind farms and large solar farms were ‘mature technologies’ which no longer need to be subsidised.

‘It
is immoral for hardworking base-rate taxpayers to be lining the pockets
of landowners by funding large scale deployment of mature renewables 
that shouldn’t need further subsidy.

‘Piling regressive taxes and green levies on to bills is unfair.’

Mr
Fallon said green policies are the only part of bills that could be 
cut, as it is impossible to control world oil and gas prices.

Five of the Big Six have already unveiled another round of inflation-busting price rises and the sixth, E.ON, will be announcing an increase on Friday.

Mr Davey said he did not have the power to prevent prices rising again, despite the taxpayer-funded cut in green levies that are used to pay for homes to be insulated.

‘They [energy companies] are going to have to reduce bills for households compared to what they would have been,’ he said

But households will still face bills rising faster than inflation and critics said the move failed consumers.

Clare Welton, from Fuel Poverty Action, said she ‘would not be surprised to see price rises in the coming months and years’ from ‘companies that have always put their shareholders’ returns before the right of their customers to keep warm and healthy’.

And Miss Robinson said: ‘It’s vital that consumers do not walk away from this thinking that they have a cast-iron guarantee that they are protected from future hikes. They aren’t.’

And Adam Scorer from Consumer Futures 
said £50 a year off bills ‘will not make a substantial difference to the
millions of people suffering fuel poverty’.

British
Gas has said it will lower bills by £53 on January 1 as a result of the
green levy cut –  but that is not until customers have spent this month
paying full rates.

Npower
– which announced the biggest recent price rise, 10.4 per cent – said 
it would pass on the levy cut to consumers through a price freeze.

Chief
executive Paul Masarra said: ‘We don’t plan to increase energy prices 
before spring 2015 – unless there are increases in wholesale energy 
costs or network charges.’

Energy Secretary Ed Davey has admitted that even with the £50 cut to green levies for every customer, bill may still go up

Southern Electric owner SSE said it may not lower its prices until the end of March.

ScottishPower boss Neil Clitheroe said: ‘We will continue to try and avoid further price rises in 2014, but this will depend on whether there are increases in wholesale energy prices or other costs outside our control.’

Experts have warned that Britain faces an energy crisis, with ageing power plants closing and plans to build new generators behind schedule.

National Grid, which transports power and gas around the country, says it needs to spend billions upgrading its networks.

A spokesman said: ‘In order to ensure that the UK continues to experience the secure and reliable electricity supplies that we need for homes and businesses, then there has to be investment in capacity and for that we need a stable investment environment.’
