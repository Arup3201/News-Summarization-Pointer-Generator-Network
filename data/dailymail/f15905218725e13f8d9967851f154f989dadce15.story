The makers of a commercial for Vodafone Egypt are being investigated after a little-known rapper claimed the advert included coded signals for bomb attacks by the Muslim Brotherhood.

Egyptian state security prosecutors said they have launched an investigation following a complaint by 25 year-old rapper Ahmed Spider.

Spider
 told Al-Tahrir TV channel baubles on a
 Christmas tree featured in the commercial represented bombs.

Claims: A little-known rapper claims this advert by Vodafone Egypt includes signals for bomb attacks by the Muslim Brotherhood

He said the tree's branches mimicked
 the four-finger gesture used to symbolise the raid by security forces last year which killed hundreds of supporters of ousted 
Islamist President Mohamed Mursi in Cairo.

The ad shows Egyptian puppet character 
Abla Fahita and her daughter Karkoura desperately searching for her 
deceased father's SIM card.

Speaking on the phone with a friend called 'Mama Touta', Fahita says she asked for the sniffer dog of a shopping 
mall to search for the missing card.

Spider said the mall and the dog were code words for the planned sites of a coming attack. He added that 'Mama Touta' was a name for the Brotherhood.

'These elements tell us that there will be a big mall and an explosion after a dog fails to find the bomb in a car', he said.

Vodafone, the world's biggest mobile operator by revenue, rejected the suggestions there was any hidden meaning.

In
 a statement yesterday it said the ad posted on YouTube and social media
 channels, which features a well-known puppet character, was meant to 
promote a special offer for customers to re-activate their old SIM 
cards.

Any other 
explanations 'are pure fiction and personal opinions' for which the 
company is not responsible, it added, suggesting it might take legal 
action 'against whomever (is) trying to distort the company's 
reputation'.

'Abla
 Fahita is a comic character, used in this ad as a tool to clarify the 
offer to viewers/customers, in a comic and sarcastic context,' Vodafone 
said in its statement.

'The ad
 is only a marketing communication tool. It does not carry any hidden 
messages or meanings other than what has been mentioned above.'

'Fiction': Vodafone strongly deny the claims, saying the advert - which features several famous Egyptian puppets (pictured) - is 'comic' and 'sarcastic'

Company spokesman Khaled Hegazy had 
earlier said that employees from Vodafone Egypt's marketing and legal 
departments had been asked about who made the commercial.

'We
 are very sad that there are people who think in this way in Egypt,' 
said Hegazy, voicing concern a top state prosecutor had taken the suggestion the advert was promoting 
terrorism seriously.

Security sources told Reuters reporters the singer was known to be an anti-Islamist and a supporter of the army which last July removed elected president Mursi after protests against his rule.

The case triggered satirical comment on social media.

Backlash: Twitter users yesterday mocked the rapper's claims, saying the puppet couldn't possibly represent terrorism

'Egypt
 security: If somebody sees or knows where Abla Fahita, the Muslim 
Brotherhood terrorist puppet, is hiding contact our Muslim Brotherhood 
hotline,' a tweet under the name of arab resistance read.

Another
 tweet by Iyad El-Baghdadi said: 'Forget the four-finger sign, Abla 
Fahita should become the symbol of resistance to Egypt's new regime'

The government has designated Mursi's Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organisation and accused it of carrying out a suicide bomb attack last week on a police compound in Nile Delta in which 16 people were killed.

The Brotherhood, long Egypt's main political opposition force, has denied any links to the attack.

Vodafone Egypt, one of three mobile network operators in the country, is about 55 per cent owned by Britain's Vodafone and around 45 per cent by state-owned landline monopoly Telecom Egypt .
