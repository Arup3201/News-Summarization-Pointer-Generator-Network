A never-before-heard tape of Monica Lewinsky reportedly telling then-President Bill Clinton that she could 'take all my clothes off' if he agreed to an illicit meeting with her has surfaced today.

The tape, which records the White House intern desperately trying to lure him into meeting her, was reportedly released to the National Enquirer after it was obtained by a cleaner hired by friends of Lewinsky.

It was long thought that the raunchy four-minute tape, which was recorded in November 1997, had been destroyed after the sexual affair was revealed in 1998, according to the Enquirer.

The recording, made months after their final alleged trust in March 1997, reportedly shows a determined Lewinsky, then 24, pleading with the married president to meet her - and telling him she plans to be persistent because 'I really want to see you'.

Revelations: An image from November 1995 shows President Bill Clinton and intern Monica Lewinsky - two years before she reportedly made an audio tape begging for him to meet with her

She adds that she is 'too cute and adorable' to be ignored, according to the magazine.

MailOnline has contacted a Clinton representative for comment on the latest reports.

On the recording, she offers Clinton two choices - that she could meet him at his office, or that they could watch a movie together.

'Since I know you will be alone tomorrow evening, I have two proposals for you, neither of which is you not seeing me,' she says, the National Enquirer reported.

'I could take my clothes off and start… 
well… I know you wouldn't enjoy that? I hope to see you later and I hope
 you will follow my script and do what I want.'

Former life: Lewinsky, who is pictured in March this year, was just 24 at the time of the recording

Together: At the time of the affair between 1995 and 1997, he was married to Hillary Clinton, pictured in April. There are concerns that these revelations could upset her expected run for the White House

She tells Clinton that his secretary, 
Betty Currie, should plan his schedule so that they could get away with 
not formally recording the meeting, according to the magazine.

For one plan, she instructs him to tell Currie that he was going to leave the office around 7pm the next evening before returning later that evening.

'In the meantime I quickly sneak over and
 then we can have a nice little visit for, you know, 15 minutes or half 
an hour. Whatever you want,' she says.

Her second suggestion is meeting him for a movie 'and just have kind of, I don¹t know, boxed dinners or 
something like that', she says.

She adds: 'You can't refuse me because I'm too cute and adorable and soon I won't be here anymore to pop over.'

Look of love: Lewinsky and Clinton are pictured together in December 1996. On the tape, she reportedly told him she could take off her clothes or suggested they went to a movie and had dinner together

Tapes and letters obtained by the National Enquirer reportedly show Monica Lewinsky desperate to meet with Clinton as their affair came to an end. Excerpts from the tape:

'Since I know you will be alone tomorrow evening, I have two proposals for you, neither of which is you not seeing me. So just deal with it!'

'I [can] quickly sneak over and then we can have a nice little visit for, you know, 15 minutes or half an hour. Whatever you want. I would really, really, really, really, really like that...

'My other proposal... maybe we could go over and watch a movie together and just have kind of, I don't know, boxed dinners or something...

'Those are the two proposals and you can't refuse me because I'm too cute and adorable and soon I won't be here anymore to pop over...

'I'm very persistent but I really want to see you... I could take all my clothes off and start...'

Excerpts from the letters:

'It was so sad seeing you last night 
because I was so angry with you that you once again rejected me and yet,
 all I wanted was for everyone else in the room to disappear and for you
 to hold me. I loved you with all of my heart, Bill.

'For the life of me, I can't understand how you could be so kind and so cruel to me...

'What did I do to deserve this? I am seriously depressed 
because of everything that has happened... I have lost profoundly both 
professionally and personally, and in a toss-up, our personal 
relationship changing has caused me more pain.'

She tells him that he should tell Currie what he wanted to do so she could call her 'so I don¹t have to stress out all day and
 I don¹t have to call her every two hours and bug her because, I know 
you will find this very hard to believe, but I can be a pain in the ass 
sometimes'.

'I'm very persistent, but um… I really want to see you,' she says.

The Enquirer reported that Lewinsky played the tape for Linda Tripp, who later revealed telephone tapes of the intern which led to Clinton's impeachment.

Tripp reportedly heard it on November 20, 1997 and it was taken to the Oval Office the next day, but it is not known if a rendezvous ever occurred. In the audio, Lewinsky explained that she had decided to record it because she couldn't face writing him another letter.

The Enquirer reported that the tape - and begging love letters Lewinsky wrote to Clinton - were obtained by a cleaner who was hired by friends of Lewinsky's.

'I was supposed to shred everything in late 1998, but for some reason I kept this material,' the cleaner told the Enquirer.

The pleading notes reportedly reveal Lewinsky 
begging Clinton to make time for her and to explain why he ended their 
illicit romance.

'It was so sad seeing you last night 
because I was so angry with you that you once again rejected me and yet,
 all I wanted was for everyone else in the room to disappear and for you
 to hold me,' she wrote. 'I loved you with all of my heart, Bill.

'For the life of me, I can't understand how you could be so kind and so cruel to me.'

Another
 letter asks: 'What did I do to deserve this? I am seriously depressed 
because of everything that has happened...

'I have lost profoundly both 
professionally and personally, and in a toss-up, our personal 
relationship changing has caused me more pain.'

Vehement: Clinton initially denied the affair with Lewinsky in January 1998 - but later admitted to it

Lewinsky was just 22 when she allegedly had the first of nine sexual encounters with the president between November 1995 and March 1997. Details of the affair emerged in 1998.

In the wake of the scandal, Lewinsky became the center of a political storm and gave a series of high-profile interviews.

But unable to escape the shake the 
reputation, she moved to England in 2005 where she earned her master's 
degree and worked as a news correspondent for the UK's Channel Five 
News.

Though it has been 15 
years since her claims, her presence still looms in the life of 
Clinton's post-presidency and Hillary's political career.

And
 sources told the National Enquirer that this most recent revelation 
could derail Hillary's expected bid for the White House in 2016.

Out and about: Lewinsky, who is now 40, is pictured out in New York last October

Damage? Hillary and Bill Clinton are pictured in Little Rock, Arkansas earlier this month

'The Clintons thought this sex tape was dead and buried,' said the source. 'If this tape and other material are surfacing now, imagine what else must be out there?'

It comes at an already embarrassing moment for the Clintons as they deal with yet another sexting scandal surrounding mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner.

His wife, Huma Abedin, is one of Hillary's top aides - but is taking an extended vacation to deal with the upset following news of her husband's latest indiscretions.
