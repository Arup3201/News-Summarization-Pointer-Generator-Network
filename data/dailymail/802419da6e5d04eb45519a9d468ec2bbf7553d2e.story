Guilty: The man admitted cruel attacks on his wife, two daughters and son between 1999 and 2011 (file picture)

A father who hung his daughter upside 
down from a chandelier and subjected his children to a series of cruel 
punishments for trivial matters, has been jailed for five years.

The 44-year-old man, from Halliwell, 
Bolton, Greater Manchester, admitted inflicting a catalogue of cruel 
attacks on his wife, two daughters and son between 1999 and 2011, to 
punish them for things as trivial as spilling salt.

Bolton Crown Court heard how the man locked his son in a dark outhouse after he saw him playing with a toy car, and dislocated his two-year-old daughter's arm by 'roughly' dumping her in a cot.

Jailing him for five years and three months yesterday at Manchester Crown Court, judge Maureen Roddy, said: 'Conduct in some of the charges, 
had it been used in war time interrogation, it would have been subject 
to real criticism - and I remind you that this is treatment of real 
children in a family home.'

The court heard how the man, who can't be named to protect the identity of his children, even tied up his two daughters and covered their head with a sheet 
when neither owned up to spilling salt.

When the children's mother tried to 
intervene, he ripped her nightdress off, leaving her naked in front of 
her children, before beating her.Â 

On another occasion one of the girls 
was chastised by being draped upside down from a chandelier by her feet 
and her bare bottom hit with the cling film. The court heard that cling film became the defendant's weapon of choice.

A further cruelty charge related to 
him biting one of his daughter's arms. He then hit her with a roll of 
cellophane wrap. When people noticed the bite marks he blamed it on 
another child.

Manchester Crown Court judge Maureen Roddy said some of the charges would have been harsh if used in wartime interrogation. He sentenced him to five years

The man's 
seven-year-old son also wet himself because he was so scared when his 
father 'flew into a rage' after seeing him playing with a toy car. He 
was locked in a dark outhouse before being dragged back into the house 
and stripped naked.

Ten years ago the man also attacked his wife with a rolling pin while she was pregnant.

She had a miscarriage the following day, but there is no medical evidence to suggest it was caused by his actions.

The man was also charged with actual bodily harm charge following an attack on his wife in front of her children in which she suffered a black eye.

Farrhat Arshad, defending, said the man believed he was disciplining his children in an act of love.

Judge Roddy said the defendant's attacks against his wife showed the children how she was powerless against his brutality and unable to protect the children from him.

She said: 'I accept it wasn't without happy times but it was a life lived in the shadow of these dramatic incidents of cruelty.'

She said the defendant will feel a term of imprisonment more acutely as he is unable to speak English.

He pleaded guilty to eight counts of 
child cruelty, assault on a woman, assault on a 16-year-old girl and 
causing a woman actually bodily harm.

He was jailed for 63 months for the child cruelty charges, 18 months for actual bodily harm and 81 days for common assault. All sentences will run concurrently.
