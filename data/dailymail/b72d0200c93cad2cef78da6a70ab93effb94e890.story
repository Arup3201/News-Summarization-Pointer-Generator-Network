The wife of a former NFL player has said the league did more to protect her enraged husband than to help her when she called for help as he was smashing the walls of their home with a baseball bat.

Dewan Smith-Williams says she called her husband Wally Williams' NFL liaison and was told: 'Don't call the police.'

Ms Smith-Williams is speaking out about the abuse the says she suffered at her husband's hands to help raise awareness about the spouses of violent NFL players. 

Cry for help: Dewan Smith-Williams says when her husband became violent, she called his NFL liaison, who told her, 'Don't call the police'

The league's handling of the Ray Rice domestic violence arrest has engulfed professional football in scandal and threatens to undercut the popularity of the most profitable sport in America.  

Rice was suspended for just two games after he was charged. When video from the incident emerged last week that showed him punching his then-fiance and knocking her out, fans were outraged. The league responded by banning Rice indefinitely - despite claims that officials had already seen the video.

Ms Smith-Williams told the New York Daily News that the NFL offered her no help when she hid in fear from her 6-foot-2 offensive lineman husband while he was playing for the New Orleans Saints.

Williams retired from the NFL in 2003, after ten seasons. 

'He went and got a baseball bat and was hitting the walls and doors. I ran into a room, shut the door and called his NFL liaison to say I was really afraid,' she told the Daily News.

The liaison told her: 'Don’t call the police, we’ll handle it.’ 

She says she was instructed to let her husband leave the house and that the NFL liaison would call her back to make sure she was OK. 

She never got a return phone call, she claims. 

Mr Williams, currently a football commentator on CBS sports radio in Baltimore, could not be reached for comment. 

She says NFL teams, league officials and even the police 'turn their heads to everything until something horrible is exposed.' 

Ms Smith-Williams is still married to her husband - though they live separately. She left him and moved to Ohio, where she became a psychiatric nurse who deals with victims of domestic abuse.
