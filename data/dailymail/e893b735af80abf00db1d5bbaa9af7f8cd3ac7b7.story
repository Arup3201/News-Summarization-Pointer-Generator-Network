Selling a house usually means spending thousands on estate agent fees.

But Dave and Liene Penny managed thanks to their two young children making an A4 leaflet with a drawing and a handwritten note asking potential buyers to call their dad.

Astonishingly the homemade flyers, solely designed and distributed by eight-year-old Ella and Tomass, six, led to a sale in less than a week.

David and Liene Penny, from Tauton, sold their £250,000 house in just six days after their two eldest children, Ella (centre left) and Tomass (centre right) made flyers featuring a sketch of the property and 'daddy's' number

Ella, eight, and her six-year-old brother Tomass made the flyers after finding out about the move, then posted them door-to-door and handed them out at a bring-and-buy sale

The leaflet, coloured in with felt 
tip, asks that if the person reading it knows anybody who wants to buy a
 new house, then phone them up and say there is one in French Wier 
Avenue for sale.

The 
unprompted sales technique has saved a grateful Mr and Mrs Penny some 
£4,500 in estate agent fees – and boosted their chances of securing the 
£400,000 five-bedroom dream home they hope to buy.

The
 couple had put in an offer but were worried the move would be 
jeopardised by waiting to sell their four-bedroom terraced house.

After 
being told the situation Ella and Tomass decided to make 40 leaflets 
which they distributed door to door to neighbours in Taunton, Somerset, 
and at a bring-and-buy sale.

They
 also put a cardboard box outside their house for people to leave 
contact details. Within four days Mr and Mrs Penny had two offers for 
the full £250,000 asking price.

The children even made a 'For Sale' sign, rating the house at five stars and listing 'places in the house'. They also made a cardboard letter-box for buyers to put their contact details into

Two
 days later, without an estate agent in sight, a sale was agreed, and 
the family are looking forward to moving into their new house in the 
town by the end of the month.

Mrs Penny, 32, who also has a two-year-old
 son Alex with her financial adviser husband, 47, said: ‘I think as 
adults we are too shy to be quite as bold, but not the children and it 
paid off. We are very proud.’

The
 mini estate agents were treated to a meal out as a reward. Ella said: 
‘It was great when two people wanted to buy our house.’

Tomass added: ‘We spent an hour making everything. I might be an estate agent one day.’

One of the leaflets was handed to a couple at the bring-and-buy sale who passed it to friends at church who were desperate to buy a home in the area near their daughter.

The retired couple arranged a viewing - just hours before another hopeful left his contact details in the homemade box - and fell in love with the property.

After just four days of handing out the leaflets David and Liene recieved two offers for the full £250,000 asking price for their three-bed home in Taunton (pictured)

The family are now looking forward to moving into this £400,000, five-bedroom house across town - which will allow Ella, Tomass, and their two-year-old brother Alex, to have their own rooms for the first time

They immediately put in an offer which was accepted by Liene and Dave, 47, a financial adviser.

The new buyers, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: 'Our friends were so impressed with the politeness and sweetness of the two children.

'The next day she gave us the leaflet at church and we were impressed by it too. The rest, they say, is history.'

As well as saving their parents time, the enterprising children have also saved £4,500 in estate agency fees - 1.5 per cent of the sale price plus 20 per cent VAT.
