This brave boy refused to let the fact he was crippled by polio leave him helpless and has overcome his handicap by learning to walk on his hands.

Deng Zongcheng, 13, was diagnosed with the disease shortly after he was born in rural Lilou village, Henan province, China.

He lost the use of his legs before he even learned to walk.

Defiant: Dong Zongcheng displaying his handstand
skills outside the gates of Heyuan Primary School, in Henan province, 
China. Crippled by polio from the waist down, he learned to walk on his 
hands from the age of six

'I have a lot of hobbies now, including my climbing': By the age of 12 Deng was also an excellent climber, left. His school friends have learned to help him to get about and handle daily activities, right

His parents spent all the money they could on treatments. In the end both were forced to leave to work in the city, so they could send money back and continue treatment for their son.

While other children playing outside he was confined to the house, unable to afford a wheelchair and only seeing his mother and father a few times a year.

But determined Deng nevertheless learned to crawl and, by the age of six, eventually learned to walk on his hands.

By the time he was 12 he was also an excellent climber.

Determination: Deng Zongcheng, now 13, was diagnosed with polio shortly after he was born in rural Lilou village. His parents were forced to go to work in the city, so they could send money back to pay for treatment for their son

His enormous determination to succeed and not to be confined by his limitations impressed many people in the village and attempts were made to find a place at a school.

He was rejected more than a dozen times before finally he was offered a scholarship at an independent school - the nearby Heyuan Primary School.

He has been accepted as a boarding student and the other children have learned how to help take care of him, with one even carrying him to the bathroom when needed.

Classmates help Deng to wash: He was rejected more than a dozen times from various schools before finally he was offered a scholarship at Heyuan Primary School, an independent school near to his home town

'I have many friends here at school': Deng now hopes that all of the publicity that has generated interest in his case might also lead to further treatment where he will eventually be able to walk one day

'I have many friends here at school,' he said. 'They all look after me, I am very lucky and I also have a lot of hobbies now, including my climbing.'

Now Deng is hoping that all of the publicity that has generated interest in his case might also lead to further treatment where he will eventually be able to walk one day.

Doctors have already said that there might be a chance to help Deng and friends are now hoping to raise enough money to start the treatment.
