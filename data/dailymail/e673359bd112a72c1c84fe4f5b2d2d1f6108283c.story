The average Briton will have consumed 38,000 calories over the festive period and gained up to 6lbs in weight, according to new figures.

A study found that the typical adult gorges on the equivalent of 15 days' worth of food in just eight days between Christmas Eve and New Year's Day.

Between Christmas Eve and Boxing Day alone, the average person consumed 15,000 calories, thanks to a turkey dinner with all the trimmings.

Calorific: A turkey dinner with all the trimmings can contain up to 1,450 calories

And a further 18,000 calories will have been squeezed in by tomorrow, by quaffing an average of 16 cans of lager, nine glasses of wine and two glasses of Champagne on New Year's Eve.

Second and third helpings add another 3,000 calories, while snacks - including chocolate, crisps and nuts - bring the total to a scale-busting 38,000 calories.

The recommended daily calorie allowance for an eight-day period is approximately 20,000 for men, and roughly 16,000 for women.

It means the average man and woman will consume up to double the recommended calorie intake every day of the holidays and gain up to 6lbs by early 2013.

Tempting: Two portions of Christmas pudding with custard and brandy butter contain 1,174 calories

The figures were compiled in the run-up to Christmas by weight-loss experts Vitagetics, makers of the slimming pill Vita-Lean.

One thousand adults were polled about their usual Christmas and New Year eating habits, and also recorded a breakdown of their proposed menus this year.

A spokesman for Vita-Lean said: 'The Christmas period is all about indulgence, but it's easy to forget that over-indulgence is bad news for the waistline, and for our health.'

Over the festive period, the average Briton consumed:

Christmas dinner with all the trimmings (1,450 calories)

Two slices of Christmas pudding, custard and brandy butter (1,174 calories)

Two slices of Christmas cake (679 calories)

One portion of chocolate log (300 calories)

Two portions of trifle (470 calories)

Three portions of ice cream (954 calories)

Five portions of cheese and biscuits (1,250 calories)

One portion of mixed nuts (243 calories)

Two glasses of mulled wine (490 calories)

One glass of eggnog (343 calories)

Three other roast dinners (1,950 calories)

Five turkey sandwiches (1,415 calories)

13 chocolate bars (6,630 calories)

Six-10 packets of crisps (3,120 - 4,000 calories)
