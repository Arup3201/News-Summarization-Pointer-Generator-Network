Having seen Real Madrid sign three of the most outstanding players from the last World Cup, some Barca fans could be forgiven for feeling their big rivals have stolen a march on them this summer.

But the club have spent around £127million on transfers and sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta has brought in six new faces doubling-up in positions where a club legend - Victor Valdes and Carles Puyol – needed replacing.

The headlines have largely been written by Madrid but if Barca can get Thomas Vermaelen and Luis Suarez on the pitch and keep them there; ensure that signing two ‘first-choice’ keepers doesn’t mean war on the training ground; and squeeze the best out of Xavi (who has stayed) and Gerard Deulofeu (who has come back) then this could still be their strongest group since 2011.

As a former Barcelona and Spain keeper Zubizarreta ought to have been the perfect man to pick a new keeper and there are few doubts over the quality of the Chilean Claudio Bravo signed from Real Sociedad and Marc-Andre ter Stegen brought in from Borussia Monchengladbach. Both are good with their feet as well as their hands, have experience in top leagues and, at 31 and 22, have years ahead of them – Stegen more than Bravo.

The only doubt concerns the wisdom of buying two keepers of similar standing who will both want to play all the time. Madrid played Iker Casillas in the cups and Diego Lopez in the league last season but the former suffered from a lack of continuity and played poorly in the Champions League final.

Defensively they have at least finally signed an out-an-out centre-back in Vermaelen. There are concerns about the ongoing injury problems that meant he joined the club and headed straight for the treatment room but if he gets fit and stays fit there is little doubt his intelligence, distribution and aerial ability will make him an asset. The slightly less physical demands of La Liga will suit a player for whom the 90-minute intensity of the Premier League was beginning to take its toll.

Jeremy Mathieu will also reinforce Barça’s famously under-resourced defence. He has pace to burn and having started his career as a left-back he could play on the left of a back three should Luis Enrique go 3-4-3 this season. The Frenchman signed from Valencia will be 31 this October and Vermaelen will be 29 in November. But experience is what Barcelona need defensively as they wait to see how younger players such as Edgar Le and Frank Bagnack develop.

The big plus with Mathieu is that he does not need to adapt to a new league. And neither does Ivan Rakitic who joined from Sevilla aged 26 and has been impressive in pre-season. Taking set-pieces and releasing forwards with the passes that, as an occasional starter, Xavi will also still be able to provide. Rakitic was the outstanding midfielder in La Liga last season and it looks good business.

Which just leaves the biggest piece of business Barcelona have done this summer – bringing in Luis Suarez for £75m.

His current ban has supporters’ excitement on hold. But if the Court of Arbitration allows him to return to ‘football-related’ activity he will be presented at the Camp Nou and can begin to get acquainted with the other two thirds of what Barcelona hope will be an explosive front three to leave even Real Madrid’s Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema, Cristiano Ronaldo trio in the shade.

Will it work? Suarez showed with his second goal against England in Sao Paulo at the World Cup what he can do running the right channel and Neymar is happy on the left. And both will get their chance to play more centrally when Messi drops deep so there is no reason why it won’t. When Messi doesn't play Suarez will play through the middle and Pedro will be given a chance to impress out wide.

Suarez also brings an intensity that Barcelona have missed in the last three seasons and like Matheiu and Rakitic his career lacks silverware giving Barcelona back the desire they lost with a squad bloated by having won so much in such a short space of time.

They have spent more than their rivals. And with Suarez banned, Vermaelen injured and Mathieu admitting to liking the occasional cigarette when he joined, and evidently neither Thiago Silva nor Mats Hummels, it would be easy to say they have not got their money’s worth. But when the squad is written down in black and white, it’s hard to see where the gaps are.
