Blackpool's pre-season struggles continued as they fielded five trialists in their starting line-up in their 4-0 win over Penrith - and had another two on the bench.

The Championship club were forced to cancel a trip to La Manga due to a shortage of players, and there has been speculation that manager Jose Riga is ready to quit the club in protest at the mess.

Blackpool begin the new season on August 9 at Nottingham Forest and will be forced to sign a raft of new players before then if they are going to be competitive.

Trialists: Jacob Mellis and Ben Alnwick are believed to be among the players on trial

Nathan Delfouneso, Faris Haroun, Elliott Grandin, Martin Cranie, Jacob Mellis and Angel Martinez and former Tottenham goalkeeper Ben Alnwick are believed to be among the trialists.

Chairman Karl Oyston downplayed the situation, claiming a number of new players were set to arrive at the club.

He told the club's official website: “I see absolutely no reason why we shouldn’t be able to recruit sufficient numbers and quality to be able to compete in The Championship. The main thing people want to see is players signing for us and I think once we get some signed, and everything settles down, then we’ll soon forget about some of the problems.

'We’re finding it difficult to land some of the players we’ve been chasing. That’s always the case, but unfortunately it’s with backdrop of not having many players, so it probably focuses things a little more than would normally be the case.'

Blackpool quickly took a 3-0 lead against Penrith thanks to two goals from trialist Delfouneso and one from Sergei Zenjov.
