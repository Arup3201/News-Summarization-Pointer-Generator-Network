DEREK LAWRENSON: Asked recently to name the Formula One Driver of the Year, a man as knowledgeable as David Coulthard found he couldn’t split the respective claims of Lewis Hamilton and Daniel Ricciardo and called it a tie.

And this is supposed to be the main rival to Rory McIlroy, who has just compiled unquestionably the greatest season in the entire history of golf in the United Kingdom. A man who may or may not be the best driver this year.

No such ambivalence in golf, of course. There’s not a soul in the sport who wouldn’t confirm without a moment’s hesitation that McIlroy was not just the best driver, he was the best in every other category as well.

He has been named Player of the Year by his peers on the PGA Tour, the PGA of America, and the Association of Golf Writers, while the European Tour will surely follow suit this week.

The problem Hamilton has got is that we don’t really know how good he was given the car he was driving was so superior to the rest. But in golf, everyone can play the same clubs and balls as McIlroy. We can say without fear or favour that he blew them away simply because he was miles better.

During the summer, McIlroy won two majors — The Open and USPGA — and a World Golf Championship event with 12 rounds of perfection. Rickie Fowler described it as ‘probably the best stretch of golf ever played.’ McIlroy also won the European Tour’s flagship event at Wentworth and played a leading role in Europe’s Ryder Cup victory.

Never mind he declared for Ireland for the Olympics. He had no choice given the invidious politics. Take it from me: the Belfast boy is a proud member of the United Kingdom.

So get behind him tonight. In fact, get behind him full stop. This man is going to do things over the next decade that will transcend golf and be Federer-like, Ronaldo-like and Messi-like, and you won’t want to miss it.

JONATHAN MCEVOY: Lewis Hamilton and Rory McIlroy are both glorious talents. They each go about their sport with more élan than any contemporary can muster.

So handing the Sports Personality title to either would not remotely be a travesty in sporting terms.

But this is the British Broadcasting Corporation’s award. Yet only one of the two leading contenders, Lewis Hamilton, wishes to be known as British (even though he is the one living in a tax haven).

McIlroy has cast himself away to Ireland for Olympic purposes and, by any reasonable logic, should not pick up one of our national baubles.

At least Hamilton, who moved from Switzerland to Monaco, wears the Union flag on the underside of his long-peak cap and smiled on each of the 11 times God Save the Queen honoured one of his race victories.

I am afraid Mr McIlroy has signed and returned his card, and disqualified himself.

The case for Hamilton is, in itself, immensely strong. There are more than a billion drivers in the world. Only a golden thread win world titles.

And at the very top of the pyramid are drivers who, through their magical prowess, transcend their sport. Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton, the double world champion, is one such person.

This year alone he eclipsed Sir Jackie Stewart’s record of grand prix wins (albeit there are more races now).

Of course, ‘personality’ is a slightly different thing from high-performance achievement. Yet with his bling and his tattoos, Hamilton at least stands out among his pit-lane peers.

As this is the season of goodwill, I have the perfect solution: Lewis for the Sports Personality of the Year and Rory — the admittedly brilliant Rory — for the Overseas award.
