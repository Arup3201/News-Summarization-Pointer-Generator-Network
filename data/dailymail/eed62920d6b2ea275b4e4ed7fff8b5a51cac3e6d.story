Skin cancer: John Darwin in a 2008 handout picture from Cleveland Police. He is suffering from skin cancer related to his time spent in the tropics

Canoe conman John Darwin has been treated for skin cancer which he believes may have been caused by the tropical sun while he was on the run in Panama, it emerged today.

Darwin spent some two years in the Latin American country after he faked his own death by apparently disappearing in a canoe in the North Sea.

The father of two has undergone surgery to help overcome the illness, but doctors have warned him the condition is likely to reoccur, reports say.

They have told the convicted fraudster, 62, who was jailed for a million pound life insurance scam, that his cancer was caused by 'high ultra-violet sunlight', according to the Sunday Mirror.

Darwin, who now lives in Hartlepool, told the Sunday Mirror: 'I do have skin cancer. I've had an operation. Did I get it in Panama? Well I've been told it was caused by intense sunlight.'

The former prison officer and teacher in 2002 conspired with his wife Anne to fake his own death and claim almost Â£1million in life insurance.

A death certificate was issued after the empty wreck of a canoe was found in which he had been seen paddling into the North Sea near the family home in Seaton Carew, County Durham.

The couple's grown up sons, Mark, 36, and Anthony, 32, were left heartbroken.

They were unaware their father was alive and living in a bedsit next door to Anne, 61, which could be accessed through a wardrobe.

Under the assumed identity John Jones, taken from a local child who died in infancy, Darwin travelled around the world planning a new life for himself and his wife.

was jailed for six years and three months after failing to convince 
police he had amnesia

The couple bought a flat and land in Panama, where temperatures average 27C, and hoped to open a hotel and canoeing centre focusing on eco-tourism.

But in 2007 he returned from the country and walked into West End Central police station in London, claiming to have no memory of the past five years.

His lies were quickly uncovered after pictures were found on the internet of him and Anne posing for a photograph in the office of an estate agency in Panama City.

Hoodwinked: Darwin's sons, Anthony, right, and Mark leave Teeside Crown court after their parents Anne and John were sentenced to over six years in prison each on July 23, 2008. They were not in on the scam

The fraud saw Darwin jailed for six years and three months and Anne for six years and six months. They were forced to sell everything they owned to repay the insurance companies and pension funds they had defrauded.

Now Darwin's attempt to start a new life in the sun has apparently had another unintended consequence with his diagnosis of and treatment for skin cancer.

An unnamed source told the Sunday Mirror that doctors had told Darwin that his cancer is linked to the time he spent in the tropics and the failed-fraudster is convinced it is down the time he spent in Panama.

'He went to Panama to escape justice but he couldn't get away from the sun,' the source said.
