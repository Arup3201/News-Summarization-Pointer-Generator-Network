Alan Pardew says £12million France midfielder Remy Cabella is not ready for the demands of the Premier League, warning that he could revert to the bench at Arsenal on Saturday.

The 24-year-old has been in and out of the Newcastle side since his big-money move from Montpellier in the summer.

Cabella has shown flashes of the promise which won him a place in the France squad at the World Cup in Brazil, but has otherwise looked off the pace of the English top flight.

Remy Cabella started in Newcastle's win over Chelsea, but was replaced after 53 minutes with the score at 0-0

Cabella has played some part in 14 of Newcastle's Premier League games, but not established himself

And Pardew said: ‘I’ll pick and choose (when he plays). He’s not ready for the demands of this division yet.

‘Before I started him against Chelsea I said that he would be like this all year for us – he’ll be in, out, he’ll start, he’ll be sub.

Newcastle boss Pardew, November's manager of the month, says Cabella may sit out against Arsenal

‘The way he plays, sometimes he can get lost a little bit. But when the game gets open, like it did second half at Burnley and Spurs, he can have more and more influence when we get a bit more possession.

‘It actually favours him a little bit when the game slows down and he comes off the bench and can affect the game.’

The Newcastle manager says coming off the bench suits the Frenchman's game as he adapts to the league

Cabella has shown flashes of his brilliant best, but has not been able to perform consistently yet
