Women should be encouraged to take up ‘sports’ like cheerleading and ballet, the sports minister Helen Grant has claimed on the day that Britain's women won bronze in the curling at the Winter Olympics.

Insisting women did not need to feel ‘unfeminine’ while keeping fit, she said it was possible to look ‘radiant’ and ‘absolutely gorgeous’ while taking part in activities like roller skating and gymnastics.

But the remarks from Miss Grant, who is also an equalities minister, were condemned for focussing on the looks of athletes and not their achievements.

Glamorous: Sports and equalities minister Helen Grant has suggested cheer leading as a sport for women

Campaigners have battled to encourage more teenage girls to take part in sports at schools by urging them to shed the need to look good at all times.

Olympic gold medal winner Jessica Ennis has spoken of her classmates’ reluctance to get ‘hot and sweaty’ when competing.

But Miss Grant suggested that women could still feel ‘feminine’ while competing in glamourous sports.

‘There are some wonderful sports which 
you can do and perform to a very high level and I think those 
participating look absolutely radiant and very feminine such as ballet, 
gymnastics, cheerleading and even roller-skating,’ she told the Telegraph.

Miss Grant also suggested ballet and rollerskating as sports which women could take part in and still look 'radiant'

Miss Grant went on: ‘It’s having a good spread on offer.

'For example some girls may well not like doing very traditional hockey, tennis or athletics, others might, so for those who don’t want to, how about considering maybe gym, ballet, cheerleading?’

She said she had watched girls aged 7-17 rollerblading at a YMCA event.

‘Those girls arrived and they looked absolutely gorgeous.

‘They were wearing their socks pulled up, beautiful socks with sequins and their hair was done.

‘But my goodness they could skate. I felt quite underdressed in my jeans.’

The comments are especially damaging coming on the day that Eve Muirhead led Team GB's women's curling team to a historic win as they beat Switzerland in the bronze match today.

The female curling team's win guaranteed that Britain will walk home with the most medals in a Winter Olympics since 1924.

Muirhead,
 the leader of an all-Scottish team including Anna Sloan, Vicki Adams 
and Claire Hamilton,  punched the air in delight after she sealed 
victory with the last stone of the 10th end, keeping her cool to take 
the point that left the Swiss empty-handed.

‘I am so happy, we are all pushing each other and it makes it more fun to win something,’ she said.

Laura Bates, founder of the Everyday Sexism project, insisted Miss Grant was wrong to focus on the looks of sportswomen and suggest the purpose of sport is to be 'girlie and feminine'.

“We shouldn’t say women should only do sports while they look radiant and beautiful. It’s actually discouraging for a minister to say this. It suggests the problem is coming from the young women themselves, when I think a big problem is societal responses.'

Miss Grant has stumbled before since being handed the sports brief last October. She was left humiliated after she failed to get a single question right in a basic quiz – on sport.

She did not know the name of the current Wimbledon women’s champion, who won the FA Cup or the name of the England Rugby captain.

In fact she got all five questions wrong in a quiz on ITV Meridian, and ended up pleading with the presenter: ‘Come on, help.'

Despite her support for 'feminine' sports, Miss Grant herself has a lengthy sporting pedigree.

She was an under-16 judo champion for the north of England and southern Scotland while at school in Carlisle, and also captained the school's tennis and hockey teams, as well as being a county-level athlete, cross-country runner, tennis and hockey player.

A DCMS spokesman said: 'It is nonsense that the minister suggested women's participation in sport should be based on looks.

'The point is that there is a sport or physical activity out there for all women. For some it will be tennis or football, for others judo or dance.

'Women decide what they want to do based on their interests and own lives and that choice is up to them.'
