Fernando Torres is considering a return to Atletico Madrid if they can find the necessary funds to buy him.

Atletico chief executive Miguel Angel Gil was in London negotiating over the weekend but returned to Spain on Sunday with the deal still unsigned.

Atletico were attempting to get Torres for around £14million, which is well short of Chelsea's valuation.

For sale: Chelsea are hoping to raise £20million for Torres, despite his poor form since joining from Liverpool

Struggle: Atletico are struggling to pay £20m for Torres plus meet his £8m-a-year wage demands 

Atletico have denied making any official bid for Torres but there is an interest. The player, for his part, has so far said he is happy to fight for his place at Stamford Bridge.

Chelsea signed Torres for £50m from Liverpool only three years ago and would still want £20m for the Spaniard despite the fact he has failed to reproduce the form that once made him the scourge of Europe's defences.

Atletico coach Diego Simeone hinted last season that Torres would be welcome back at the Vicente Calderon Stadium where he spent his formative years but they will have to stretch their budget.

Alvaro Negredo's broken metatarsal means he will likely stay at Manchester City but even he would have cost Atletico £26m.

Interest: Chelsea have also asked about Atletico defender Miranda, pictured here tussling with Torres

Torres is 30 now and Atletico believe their offer is a reasonable price.

The two clubs have already agreed deals on Diego Costa and Filipe Luis and although Romelu Lukaku was offered to Atletico, Simeone would prefer other options.

Chelsea have also asked about Atletico's 29-year-old Brazilian centre-back Joao Miranda but that may be a deal too far for Simeone.
