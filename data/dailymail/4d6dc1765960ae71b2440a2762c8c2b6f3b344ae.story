Tribunal: Fire station commander Warren Simpson, 48, is suing his bosses for alleged race discrimination

A black fire station commander is suing bosses for race discrimination, claiming colleagues nicknamed him ‘Frank’ after the boxer Frank Bruno.

Warren Simpson says he suffered victimisation, harassment and bullying and was passed over for promotion for seven years.

The Birmingham-based commander, 48, alleges his career was not  supported in the same way as white colleagues, leaving him ‘demeaned, subjugated and belittled’.

The commander, believed to be the highest-ranked black officer in the West Midlands Fire Service, is taking his brigade to an employment tribunal after claiming he was victim of race discrimination, including victimisation, harassment and bullying.

Mr Simpson joined the brigade in 1985
and worked at various stations before becoming a station commander at 
fire service headquarters in Birmingham.

His wife Cordell Simpson represented him at the city tribunal. She claimed he had been referred to as ‘Frank’ after the ex-world champion Bruno.

Mrs
Simpson added: 'Mr Simpson believes his development has not been 
supported in a comparable way of that of his white colleagues.'

The
discrimination accusation was denied by David Maxwell, representing 
West Midlands Fire Service, who labelled harassment and bullying claims 
as 'absolutely preposterous'.

He
suggested Mr Simpson had his 'ups and downs' with a boss but that they 
were good friends. He also accused the commander of ‘over-reacting’.

The
hearing was also told that the fire station commander had been on sick 
leave at one stage and that an occupational health report had been 
prepared.

Mr Simpson 
had previously told the tribunal he wanted a face-to-face meeting with 
one of his bosses to discuss the way he was being treated.

'Discrimination': Warren Simpson claims that bosses at West Midlands Fire Service blocked him from rising above the rank of station commander

The father-of-three said he also requested a transfer to another fire station, but the service said there had been only four vacancies available at the time at other stations.

Mrs Simpson added: 'In conclusion, it is submitted that Mr Simpson has experienced racial discrimination, victimisation and harassment in the form of a constant shifting of the goalposts by the respondents.

'They have sought to block his progression beyond that of station commander, demean, subjugate and belittle him, ignoring him when he raises serious concerns and then adding insult to injury by claiming it is all in his head and sending him for a mental health assessment.'

The hearing ended on Friday and a judgement is expected in mid-November.

Mr Simpson, from Corby in Northamptonshire, is being represented by the group Race 4 Justice, which said that he was the highest-ranked black fire service officer in the West Midlands.
