Dubai, the Middle East emirate that thinks big, is building the world’s largest man-made lagoon to stretch across 40 turquoise hectares.

Developer Crystal Lagoons expects to finish the project by 2020 and take the Guinness World Record.

The lagoon will have a Caribbean feel and is expected to dwarf a 12-hectare lagoon already built in the Egyptian resort of Sharm El Sheikh, the current title holder.

Dubai plans to build the world's largest man-made lagoon, stretching across 40 hectares and dwarfing the 12 hectare site in Egypt which currently holds the record.

The
 lagoon will include wide beaches and offer swimming and water sports in clear, filtered water - reportedly using just one per cent of the chemicals used in more traditional systems.

Earlier this week, Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid also 
unveiled plans for the Dubai Water Canal Project, with a 2.8-kilometre elevated 
waterway that will stretch from Dubai's Business Bay to the shore at Jumeirah.

The projects may mark a turning point 
for Dubai, which roiled markets with its request to delay $25 billion of
 debt payments in 2009.

Dubai is also bidding to hold the Expo 2020 World Fair and needs about $7.1b of infrastructure spending in order to host the event, according to a report this week by Bloomberg.

Dubai hopes to set a new record for the world's largest lagoon, near the Jumeirah Beach Hotel, and other Dubai attractions

The lagoon plan is the most ambitious project of its kind so far from developer Crystal Lagoons Corp., which has offices in Florida, Chile, the Middle East and Asia.

The bay will form part of the the upscale Mohammad Bin Rashid City residential community development now underway.

Luxury residences, shopping, dining and recreational facilities are part of the project.

The lagoon will cover 40 hectares, more than three times larger than the world’s biggest man-made lagoon in Egypt

Crystal Lagoons claims it will use up to 100 times fewer chemicals than traditional pool systems and just two per cent of the energy required by conventional filtering technologies

The lagoon will form an integral part of the $7 billion Mohammed Bin Rashid City

Crystal Lagoons’ 250 projects include five Middle East based developments including lagoons in the Egyptian resort of Sharm El Sheikh

Crystal Lagoons has already completed projects in Egypt's Sharm Al Shaikh, Jordan and Oman among other countries.

'Based
 on our track record in the Middle East, we have proven that our 
technology can add value to a top destination, making beachfront real 
estate a reality anywhere in the world.' said Kevin Morgan, CEO of Crystal Lagoons.

'Caribbean landscapes are no longer exclusive to tropical destinations,' Mr Morgan said.

Sheikh Mohammed said the Dubai Water Canal, announced earlier this week, will connect the Business Bay with the Arabian Gulf passing through the heart of Dubai at a cost of about US$2billion
