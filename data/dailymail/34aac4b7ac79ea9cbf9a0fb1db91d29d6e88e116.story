A jewellery designer whose body was found in his burning home had been violently attacked before his death.

Michael Griffiths, 59, was left with serious injuries to his head and body before he was found by firefighters on Thursday morning.

Detectives have launched a murder inquiry and expressed fears that he may have been targeted because of his work as a jewellery and with antiques.

Injuries: Michael Griffiths, 59, whose body was found in his burning home in Fernhurst, West Sussex, suffered serious injuries to his head and body

Murder: Police have launched an investigation, saying there is 'no doubt' that he was murdered

It is understood that Mr Griffiths lived alone at the house in Old Glebe in Fernhurst, West Sussex, and was on his own in the property at the time of the fire.

The 'talented' designer was described as a 'well-known and popular' man.

A post-mortem examination carried out yesterday by a Home Office pathologist failed to establish a cause of death but police said there 'is no doubt' that he was murdered.

Investigators said a suspicious seat of fire was found near a window in the lounge at the back of his building.

Detectives also said that two windows appeared to have been opened before the fire broke out.

Detective Chief Inspector Jeff Riley, who is leading the Surrey and Sussex major crime team, said: 'On Thursday evening, fire investigators advised us that they were suspicious of a seat of fire close to a lounge window at the rear of the house.

'Smoke patterns on a couple of the windows suggest that they were open when the fire broke out.

'The post-mortem has revealed that Mr Griffiths suffered serious injuries to his head and body, but at this stage it is not possible to firmly conclude that they were the cause of his death.

Target: Police are investigating whether Mr Griffiths, who worked with antiques and as a jewellery designer, was targeted because of his professional activity

Alone: It is understood that he was alone in the property when the incident occurred on Thursday morning

He added: 'Michael was a well-known and popular local man who was a talented jewellery designer and maker and was an enthusiastic antiques buyer and seller.

'I am considering that this may have led to him, or at least his home, being specifically targeted and this forms one of our main lines of inquiry at this time.

'There is no doubt that we are dealing with a murder and I would appeal to everyone in Fernhurst's close-knit community to think about anything suspicious or just out of the ordinary in the days leading up to the fire and especially the time between 6.30 and 8am on Thursday morning, to give us a call.'

It emerged that Mr Griffiths was visited by callers who threw snowballs when he answered from an upstairs window. at about 8.25pm on Tuesday .

The police said the incident may well have been 'an innocent prank' but said they wished to speak to anybody who had experienced a similar experience.

Forensic investigators are still examining the house today and are expected to remain at the scene for a few days.

Their work was being hampered by fire damage, with some of the upstairs area needing to be made safe before their investigations can continue.

Anyone with information is asked to call Sussex Police on 101, quoting Operation Killick, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
