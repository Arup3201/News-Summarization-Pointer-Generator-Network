It sounds like something only a Bond villain would propose, but the Nazis planned a mile-wide ‘space gun’ powered by the sun.

The giant mirror could be used to focus the sun on a target – like the magnifying glasses used by children to create fire.

A long-forgotten article from Life magazine in 1945 revealed how ‘US Army technical experts came up with the astonishing fact that German scientists had seriously planned to build a “sun gun”’.

The mile wide mirror would be able to focus the power of the sun onto a target on Earth

The giant orbital mirror would ‘focus
 the sun’s rays to a scorching point on the Earth’s surface’. The German
 army, readers were told, ‘hoped to use such a mirror to burn an enemy 
city or to boil part of an ocean’.

The idea came to renowned rocket scientist Hermann Oberth in 1923.

With an estimated cost of three 
million marks and taking 15 years to construct, the original purpose of 
the space mirror was to provide the  people of Earth with sunshine on 
demand, anywhere on the globe. But Oberth later described it as the  
‘ultimate weapon’.

‘My space mirror,’ he wrote, ‘is like
 the hand mirrors that schoolboys use to flash circles of sunlight on 
the ceiling of their classroom. A sudden beam flashed on the teacher’s 
face may bring unpleasant reactions.’

Hermann Oberth, the man behind the 'sun gun'

Hermann Oberth was an Austro-Hungarian-born German physicist and engineer.

He
 is considered one of the founding fathers of rocketry and astronautics,
 and constructed his first model rocket as a school student of 14.

In
 1928 and 1929 Oberth worked in Berlin as scientific consultant on the 
first film ever to have scenes set in space, Frau im Mond (The Woman in 
the Moon), directed at UFA-Film Co. by Fritz Lang, although he lost the 
sight in his left eye in an experiment for this film.

In
 autumn 1929, Oberth launched his first liquid fuel rocket, named 
Kegeldüse, helped by his students at the Technical University of Berlin,
 one of whom was Wernher von Braun, who would later head the wartime 
project to develop the rocket officially called the A4, but far better 
known today as the V-2 - which incorporated many of his inventions and 
ideas.

Oberth eventually came to work for his former student, Wernher von Braun, who was developing space rockets for Nasa, and  retired in 1962 at the age of 68

In 1945, when the victorious Allies 
began sifting through captured war plans, it emerged that the Nazis had 
updated Oberth’s proposals and begun looking into the possibility of the
 Third Reich building a mirror weapon in orbit 22,236 miles above the 
Earth.

Details of the sun gun emerged again after they were discussed by US military experts and appeared on internet forums.

The secret plans by Adolf Hitler's Nazi party were only found at the end of the war

Life magazine believed it would be 
put into orbit in pre-assembled sections. It would also contain a manned
 space station, with 30ft holes in which supply rockets could dock, 
hydroponic gardens to provide oxygen and solar-powered generators for 
electric power.

Once in orbit, the ‘master rocket’ 
for the project would unreel six cables. Spinning the rocket on its axis
 would extend the cables radially, allowing construction to begin.

The Germans are not the only nation 
to look into harnessing  the power of the sun. In 1999, the Russians 
unveiled a plan to use a mirror to reflect sunlight to Earth during 
winter.

The giant mirror would be assembled in space, and also contain a manned space station
