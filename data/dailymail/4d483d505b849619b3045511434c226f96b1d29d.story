A widow whose western
Pennsylvania home was sold by the county after she failed to pay
interest accrued on $6.30 in late tax fees was overjoyed when a
court ruled she can keep her home, her lawyer said on Friday.

Eileen Battisti, who is in her early 50s and lost her
husband in 2004, was unfamiliar with managing her finances and
did not understand in 2009 that she owed the $6.30 late fee.

It subsequently accrued $234.72 in interest, prompting the
tax sale of her home in 2011, said her lawyer, Ed Santillan.

A judge in Pittsburgh on Thursday ruled Battisti could keep
ownership of the home in Aliquippa, about 20 miles (32 km)
northwest of Pittsburgh.

Eileen Battisti was unsure how to run her family's finances after the death of her husband in 2004, meaning a late tax bill of $6.30 led to the sale of her home. A judge in Pennsylvania has now overturned the decision 

Mrs Battisti has been staying in the property, worth $280,000, with two of her adult children during the court proceedings and will not be forced to leave 

She has remained in the home with two of her three adult
children since it was sold by the Beaver County Tax Claim Bureau
to S.P. Lewis, a man who buys tax delinquent properties and
sells them back to their former owners for a profit, according
to court papers.

'We are thrilled with the decision of the commonwealth court
and my client cried tears of joy when she heard the news,'
Santillan said.

'I think when you read the opinion it is clear that the
property should never have been sold,' he added.

Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court Judge Mary Leavitt ruled
that county tax officials failed to provide Battisti with proper
notification or warning regarding the sale of her house.

'A reasonable tax claim bureau would have responded to
Taxpayer's payment on the 2008 taxes with an invoice for $6.30,
and it would have invoiced Taxpayer in 2010 for the 2009
shortage of $234.72,' the judge wrote in her ruling.

The home, which is worth between $250,000 and $280,000, was
sold to Lewis for $113,000. He offered to sell the property back
to Battisti for $160,000, Santillan said.

Lewis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The bureau still has the money from the sale and is expectedto return it to Lewis, Santillan said, but Lewis has 30 days toappeal the court ruling. 

The property was sold to S.P. Lewis, a man who buys tax delinquent properties and sells them back to their former owners for a profit, for $113,000. He however agreed to sell it back for $160,000
