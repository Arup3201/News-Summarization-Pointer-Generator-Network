Boris Johnson is out in front in the battle to succeed David Cameron, a new poll of Tory members reveals.

The London Mayor has the support of almost two in five Conservatives activists to become party leader.

While he sought to play down talk of a leadership bid today, Mr Johnson insisted he remains an ‘eternal optimist’ that something will ‘crop up’ after his term in the capital ends.

The survey of Conservative party members found six out of 10 think Mr Cameron should quit if he is ousted from Number 10 at the next election.

Mr Johnson is way ahead of all the other challengers, despite maneuvering by the likes of Home Secretary Theresa May and Education Secretary Michael Gove.

Mr Johnson receives the support of 38 per cent of grassroots members, double the number backing Mrs May.

Mr Gove, who has repeatedly insisted he has no leadership ambitions, is backed by 13 per cent while Chancellor George Osborne, whose stock in the party is rising as the economy recovers, got just three per cent of first preferences.

Professor Bale said: ‘Basically, our survey shows us that Cameron is toast if he can’t deliver the Tory Party a second term, and that Boris is best-placed to replace him, if he can get into the Commons, because he commands support that’s as deep as it is wide.

‘May is running a credible second, but Gove’s support is narrower. Osborne maybe in with a chance but he will have to make up a lot of ground.  No one else looks like a serious prospect.’

While Mr Johnson garners a lot of support in London, he also appeals to younger voters.

Bale added: ‘Theresa May does well among women and appeals reasonably 
well to working class as well as middle-class members, which suggests 
that a May-led Tory party may attract more support among women and the 
fabled C2s.  

‘You can’t rule out Gove or even Osborne. But in the end, Boris is the man to beat.’

However Mr Johnson dismissed the poll as ‘all fantasy politics’ as he Johnson was challenged over his ambitions as he took questions on LBC 97.3.

He added: ‘It’s not going to happen and what you’ve got is a Prime Minister who I think is increasingly confident and on top of his game.’

He insisted that while the general election is due in 2015, he will have ‘another full year as Mayor of the greatest city on earth’ to last until 2016.

And after that he will ‘completely deliquesce, something will crop up, I’m an eternal optimist’.

Asked what he would do about Deputy PM Nick Clegg if he ever became Prime Minister, Mr Johnson replied: ‘Well, thankfully that is a completely hypothetically question which I can swerverama.

‘But what I would say is that, and I’m sure this is the view of David Cameron as well who I think will continue to be Prime Minister after 2015.’

He added there is a ‘real, real chance now, a bigger chance than ever there is going to be an absolute Conservative majority at the next election’.
