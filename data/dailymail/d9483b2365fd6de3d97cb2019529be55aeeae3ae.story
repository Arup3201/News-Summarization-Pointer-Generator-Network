Nabbed: Casey Wentworth is accused of stealing a laptop over a year ago. Police arrested him Monday after a call he made to Apple tech support using the computer's serial number led police to him. But wasn't an overnight success for owner Michael Witonis

A New Hampshire man whose Mac laptop was swiped from his home while he slept in 2013 may soon finally get it back all because the alleged thief called Apple tech support.

But the call was made nearly a year ago and it's taken since then for Michael Witonis to convince Apple to give police the dirt they have on suspect Casey Wentworth.

Witonis says he finally got them to hand over their records by tweeting at CEO Tim Cook.

The Dover mechanical engineer's aggravating saga started in February 2013 when someone came into his home and took his MacBook Air, just months after he'd purchased the pricey computer.

He's chalked it up as a loss until a few months later when Apple support emailed him regarding a support call made in regards to a computer with the serial number of the one he'd had stolen.

Apple representatives informed him that they could only give their information to police.

'That was the start of an eight-month battle with Apple to get the information from them,' Witonis told ABCNews.com.

He requests to have them turn the info over to police were met with scripted responses about an internal procedure they have in place for such issues.

But the information stayed put even after Witonis obtained subpoenas. So Witonis decided to take his grievance to Apple's CEO himself via social media.

'@tim_cook #feedup with #red-tape in 
the #apple legal department. 2 subpoena still no progress. I just want 
my stolen #macbook back,' he tweeted at Tim Cook last October.

After several months of continued silence, he tweeted again.

'@tim_cook
 please help! I'm feed upÂ  w/ #apple legal dept. 8 months & 2 
subpoenas later still no progress. I just want my macbook air back,' he 
wrote

Sluggish: Witonis learned of the suspects tech support call but Apple was not forthcoming with their information that could help nab the suspect

The exasperated Witonis finally decided to tweet his problem at Tim Cook. After two attempts, Apple suddenly went from unhelpful to totally forthcoming. Two hours after the cops got their information, they located the suspect

'Within a day, a guy at Apple executive customer relations called me back,' Witonis told ABC.

Five days later, Witonis said the police were getting the necessary information.

Then Witonis says that 'within two hours' after police had it, they also had their suspect, Casey Wentworth.

Wentworth was arrested Monday and released on $1,000 bail. he's due in court in May.

Meanwhile, Witonis has yet to get back the laptop police had described to him as 'pretty beat up.'

He'll have to wait until it leaves the evidence locker before he knows exactly how beat up.

But Witonis is just happy to have some closure.

'It was sort of shocking,' Witonis told WMUR. 'I guess luck was on our side that the guy who took it didn't try to get rid of it, which was sort of strange. Then, all of a sudden, he decides in his infinite wisdom, "Well, I'll just call Apple and see if they can help me unlock this thing."'
