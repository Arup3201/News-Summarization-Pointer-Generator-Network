The Australian bride charged with adultery and bigamy offences while visiting her boyfriend in Lebanon has tearfully told of the ordeal which saw her fleeing from authorities and dodging bullets.

Sydney mother and teacher Mahessen Issa also revealed to Channel Seven's Sunday Night program what drove her to the edge of forced her halfway around the world into another man's arms.

Ms Issa and her estranged husband Bassam Abou Lokmeh were separated when she decided to travel to Lebanon earlier this year, and their relationship had been in jeopardy for a long time before.

'It got to a point where I couldn't bear to see him anymore, the disrespect in front of people, because he knew I didn't want a bar of him, I didn't want him to come next to me at all,' Ms Issa revealed.

'And he tried many many times to try to fix the relationship, but you can't, you can't piece back something that's broken a long time ago.'

When asked what forced her into the spontaneous decision to travel to Lebanon for two weeks on June 20 while her former husband was looking after their children, the mother-of-two said she had simply reached the end of her tether.

'I think I just cracked, I'd just had enough,' Ms Issa revealed. 

The mother broke down when she revealed her ordeal and how she could not speak to her children

When she touched down in Lebanon, Mr Awick - who proposed to her just hours after meeting her - would quickly find that they would be living their lives on the run for the next few months.

The couple first stayed with Mohammed's mother and her seven other children, and revealed how she would hug the youngest who was 'the same size as my daughter'.

But their trouble really began when Mr Lokmeh hired a Lebanese lawyer to officially register their Australian marriage in a Lebanese Sharia court, meaning her marriage or commitment to Mr Awick could land her in jail.

Her best hope was to prove to the Islamic court she's not married to her new partner. 

After gunshots were fired into the apartment the pair were forced to flee to another part of the country, where they met with Ms Issa's lawyer, Zali Burrows, who had flown from Sydney to help her. 

Ms Burrows went to Lebanon to negotiate with Mr Lokmeh's lawyers and told of her reasoning for wanted to assist Ms Issa.

'She told me what was happening and I just knew I had to help because she didn't have anyone in the community putting their hand up for her,' Ms Burrows said.

Ms Issa revealed how grateful she was that Mr Awick had stayed with her, admitting she would have fled if the situation was reversed 

'Her family had disowned her and not one single Muslim group had actually put a statement out there in support of her, she was basically abandoned.

On the program Ms Issa also told of the fear she and her boyfriend spent living in and how she was scared her new man would leave her.

'He risked his whole life for me,' she said.

'I was honestly scared that he would, because anyone would run - I would!

'If I was in a predicament like that and I was going to jail I would run.

'(But) he didn't. I never left him and he didn't leave me.' 

When Ms Issa's estranged husband Mr Lokmeh saw pictures of Ms Issa and Mr Awick allegedly marrying in early July and alerted authorities, that began a months-long hunt for Ms Issa.

But Ms Issa told Sunday Night the pictures were actually of a commitment ceremony, rather than a wedding.

Dressed in white and wielding a bouquet of roses, Ms Issa entered a commitment ceremony with her new partner, Mohammed Awick. The pictures, posted online, would lead to her being accused of bigamy

'In love': Sunday Night reporter Steve Pennells told Daily Mail Australia Ms Issa and Mr Awick have a very real relationship

Reporter Steve Pennells, who travelled with Ms Issa during her time on the run, said she was desperate and at risk of 'real danger' while in Lebanon.

'At times, she was frantic, scared and demoralised, verging on hysterical - she was pushed to the edge,' Mr Pennells said.  

Ms Issa, who was only meant to stay in Lebanon for two weeks, was unable to see or talk to her two children, both under the age of 10. 

She had no money, Mr Pennells said, and even heard reports her house had been rented out without her consent and possessions taken or sold. 

In July, husband Mr Lokmeh told Daily Mail Australia his wife was 'a devil... This lady, she's a devil.'

He expressed outrage that his wife had married another man before their divorce was finalised and had 'deserted our children'.

Relatives said they had 'disowned' her, with one telling Daily Mail Australia Ms Issa was crying so sympathetic Australians would come to her aid.

'We tried to put a stop to it but she decided to proceed with her marriage in Lebanon...now it has backfired on her.

'She's not going to jail because of adultery, she's going to jail because she got married while she was still married. 

'That's illegal everywhere, not just in Lebanon. All she's doing is crying out for Australia to help her.'  

Ms Issa resurfaced in Australia in earlier this month.

Ms Issa returned to Australia recently, but revealed her cousin was the only person to greet her as the rest of her family had abandoned her

She said Mohammed is her true soulmate and she hopes to be reunited with him in the future

It remains unclear how she returned as her passport was 'flagged' by the Lebanese Government following the charges.

Ms Issa applied to bring an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) against Mr Lokmeh at Bankstown Local Court on October 9, but her application was dismissed.  

At the heart of Ms Issa's saga, Mr Pennells said, was a 'very, very messy break-up story'.

Ms Issa described Mr Awick as her soulmate, and revealed to the show she had never been in love like this, despite now being back in Australia without him. He was recently denied a visitors visa.

'They always say you always know your soulmate and truly, he is.

'He loves me, and I love him, and I've never ever been in love like this.'

When asked by reporter Steve Pennels, who travelled with Ms Issa during her time on the run who she considered her husband to be, the Sydney teacher had no hesitations.

'Whether now, tomorrow, two months time, forever, Mohamed,' she said.
