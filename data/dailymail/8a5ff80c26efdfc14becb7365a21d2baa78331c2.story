She might have earned the title 'Fit Mom' with her impeccably toned body post three children.

But Maria Kang, 32, from Sacramento, California, finds keeping in shape a constant struggle because she's not genetically predisposed to looking 'like a model' or 'Barbie doll.'

In her twenties she suffered from bulimia, which saw her weight fluctuate dramatically. At her heaviest, her 5ft 4in frame tipped the scales at 152lbs - putting her in the overweight category.

Fit mom: Maria Kang, 32, from Los Angeles, California, (pictured in 2007) says keeping in shape is something she has to work hard at because she's not genetically predisposed to 'look like a model'

In an interview with MailOnline, she reveals how she started feeling self-conscious about her body from a young age.

Often she would compare herself to her taller, leaner sisters or supermodels in magazines.

'I was always heavier . . . I was chunky. ' she said.

Her mother also battled weight problems and was put on a special diet in a bid to cure diabetes and high blood pressure.

Becoming aware of the connection between food intake and weight, Ms Kang says, was a trigger for her eventual disordered eating.

Lots of hard work: The petite brunette was overweight and suffered from bulimia before getting in shape - she said the real turning point was meeting her husband and falling pregnant with her first child

Feeling 'lost' in her early twenties, the self-described 'pear-shape' brunette would binge and purge on sweet foods two to three times almost every day of the week.

'I used disordered eating to fill an empty void. It was worse when I was feeling anxious. People often call bulimia the "good girl drug" because we don’t do drugs or drink alcohol we just abuse food.'

'I had to let go of being perfect, When I became pregnant with my first child I was like "Wow this is what my body is really made for"'

As is often the case with bulimia, Ms Kang saw her weight yo-yo and her metabolism 'shut down'.

Although friends and family were aware of what was happening, they didn't know how to help.

In the end it was Ms Kang who made the conscious decision to start 'loving' herself. Determined to get physically fit and healthy, she started practicing mindful eating.

However, the real turning point came 
when she met her husband, David Casler, in 2007 and fell pregnant with 
her first son two years later.

'I
 had to let go of being perfect,' she said. 'When I became pregnant with
 my first child I was like "Wow this is what my body is really made 
for."'

Looking back on her days as a bulimic, on her blog she writes: 'It was a horrible habit.

'I felt like I had no control over my  mind and I had such self-defeating thoughts. I felt a variety of emotions, sadness, guilt, emptiness.' 

After giving birth she started treating herself 'kindly' and eating right. Because she was in a regular pattern the pounds slipped away and she managed to slim down to 125lbs.

'I think fitness always makes me 
happier it makes you feel like you can control so many things in your 
life'

Ms Kang fell pregnant with another boy a year later in 2010 and again in 2011. Each time, she said she was able to bounce back because the foundations of a 'toned figure' were already in place.

Offering a tip to other women she said: 'Be fit before you get pregnant.'

Now her favorite parts of her 125lb, 
size 2 body include her arms and 'toned abs' but she is less 
enthusiastic about her 'short', 'muscular' legs.

'I don’t have long legs. I never wear skinny jeans.'

Ms Kang came to the public's attention last month when she posted a photograph of her toned post-baby body to Facebook, captioned 'What's your excuse?'

The photo, which Ms Kang has since used as her profile picture, shows her knelt alongside her three young sons, dressed in a workout bra and matching micro shorts.

While many of her 256,000 followers cited her as an 'inspiration' some also accused her of being 'insulting', 'obnoxious' and a 'fat shaming bully'.

Indeed, one woman wrote: 'You are . . . hurtful to women and think way too much of yourself. Disgusting is what you are!'

'If I can make health a priority as a working mom of three kids who has struggled with bulimia and weight issues, then you can too!'

And a mother-of-two named Sarah added on Ms Kang's website, mariakang.com: 'I have two kids and both have caused my skin to stretch soo bad my stomach, from my rib cage straight down the the middle of my vaginal area, look like the U.S. road atlas.

'People like you who post pictures like this make people like me cry because I know that without surgery to lose the extra skin I will never look like you.'

But Ms Kang told MailOnline that she was merely being 'playful' and saying if 'if I can make health a priority as a working mom of three kids who has struggled with bulimia and weight issues, then you can too!’

To maintain her figure she likes to do 30 to 60 minutes of 'intense' strength training and cardio every morning, five to six days a week.

On a typical day she tries to get to the gym before her sons wake up or in-between her morning errands.

She
 then focuses attention on managing her elderly care homes and fitness 
progams for a non-profit she founded, Fitness without Borders, which 
promotes fitness education in schools and local communities.

'My issue is that people are often push body image before health. Right now, I'm talking about health'

'I think fitness always makes me happier it makes you feel like you can control so many things in your life. It’s the ability to be set a goal, take action, remain consistent and create a result. that process takes a lot of discipline.' she said.

When it comes to food she likes to eat protein and carbohydrates at each meal.

Describing her daily diet she said: 'I have eggs and oatmeal or eggs and fruit for breakfast.

'On the go I like to eat nuts – mainly almonds. Lunch I usually have what we had for dinner the night before. Today it will be turkey meatballs and sweet potato fries. I love salads too.'

But it's not all clean eating and, as a busy mother-of-three running on a budget, Ms Kang has admitted to eating fast food, especially when it’s convenient with her kids in tow.

Starting from a young age: She says her sons know how to do sit-ups because they watch her workout

‘There are healthier fast food options that are affordable. for example, I like the $1.50 grilled chicken wraps from Taco bell.'

Two of her other biggest temptations - bar pre-made chicken wraps - are dark chocolate and red wine.

Concluding on the topic of fitness and health she said: 'I think that we’re obviously struggling as a nation with our weight and it’s a sensitive issue.

'My issue is that people are often push body image before health. Right now, I’m talking about health.’

'I work to be a role model. It's important to love yourself and remember to strive to be better physically, professionally and personally.'
