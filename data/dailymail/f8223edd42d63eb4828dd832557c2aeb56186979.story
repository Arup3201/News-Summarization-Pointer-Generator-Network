Even though the U.S. economy appears to be on the mend, two thirds of American adults are unhappy these days, with minorities being the most miserable of the bunch, according to a new poll.

The polling company Harris Interactive surveyed online 2,345 U.S. adults between April 10-15, asking them questions to calculate their overall level of happiness.

According to the findings of the poll, only a third of Americans can quality as 'very happy.' Among the most discontented group are minorities, recent college graduates and people with disabilities.

Discontented: The Happiness Index was especially low among Hispanic Americans, which may be related to the immigration debate mired in controversy

An especially deep decline in the Happiness Index was registered among Hispanic Americans over the past two years - a trend that has been partially attributed to the acrimonious debate over immigration policy.

African-Americans appear to be less happy today than in 2011, with 36 per cent qualifying as very happy - down from 44 per cent two years ago. However, though the Happiness Index was down among black survey participants, they remain roughly as happy as caucasians.

‘Our happiness index offers insight into what's on the minds of Americans today and is a reflection of the state of affairs in our country,’ Regina Corso, senior vice president of the Harris Poll, said in a statement. ‘While the attitudes on the economy may be improving, we're seeing that this is not translating into an improvement in overall happiness.’

Among Americans with disabilities, the percentage of those very happy has slid from 34 to 31 per cent - another drop which may be related to cuts or feared cuts in services as a result of the recently implemented sequester.

College graduates appear to be less content now than two years ago - a possible casualty of a tough job market coupled with growing doubts about the true value of higher education.

While it is accepted by most people that money can't buy happiness, the survey indicates that having more of it can significantly improve one's outlook on life.

Gender gap: Men are less likely than women to quality as very happy, according to the Harris Poll

Americans earning under $50,000 in annual salary are less likely to qualify as very happy than in 2011 - down from 33 per cent to 29 per cent among those earning less than $35,000, and from 35 per cent to 32 per cent among those earning between $35,000-$49,999.

Old age is rarely associated with joy or exuberance, but poll results show that those over the age of 50 are more likely to be happy than their younger counterparts.

About 41 per cent of adults over age 65 rank highest on the Happiness Index, while the least likely to be happy are those between the age of 30-39, with about 28 per cent of this group qualifying as very happy.

Insiders vs outsiders: Political independents are less happy that either Democrats or Republicans

The survey also found that women are happier than men, while political independents are significantly less happy that members of either the Democratic of the Republican parties at 35 per cent each.

The silver lining of the rather gloomy poll results is Americans' attitude toward work: compared with 2011, fewer survey participants consider their jobs frustrating.
