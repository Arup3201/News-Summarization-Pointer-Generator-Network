Tatler's latest editorial  lays out the rules of etiquette surrounding a threesome

Tatler has long been the go-to read for anyone interested in learning how the other half lives - or seeing fellow aristo chums in the party pages.

But now the upper class bible and subject of a BBC documentary, has shared its etiquette tips for a rather racy social situation - how to behave in a threesome.

The rules laid out include guidelines on personal hygiene and how to pick the third member, if you're a couple.

The article notes: 'In sex, as in life, generosity and manners are important - particularly in a threesome. 

'It's like talking to people on either side of you at a dinner party; you must share your attention equally and not allow anyone to feel left out.'

The magazine recommends  upping the normal standards of personal grooming (because 'the stakes have been doubled').

It also  wisely suggests ensuring you are STD-free before sharing a bed with two people.

Besides these basic courtesies, the magazine explains how to have a terribly polite and correct ménage à trois without offending well-to-do friends or rocking your social circle.

According to Tatler, if you decide to get frisky at somebody else's house it is rude not to at least extend the offer of a threesome to the host first.

And whatever the venue, you can only change your mind about your participation before clothing has been removed. To leave once people are naked is classed as 'poor form'.

Once the deed is done, it is apparently acceptable to leave swiftly, without the normal obligatory emotional moments, post-coital embracing or morning-after breakfast.

If, and when, you run into someone with whom you've shared a threesome, Tatler offers very clear rules on behaviour.

Leaving no room for error it explains: 'When you next bump into the participants - at a party, for example - look them in the eye, kiss them on both cheeks (face cheeks, mind) and act insouciant.'

It is correct behaviour to  invite the host if you engage in a threesome at a party or another person's house

The eyebrow-raising article is a far cry from Tatler's usual fare, covering the latest faces at debutante balls and explaining how to behave when invited to a friend's Tuscan villa, a piece which appeared in this month's edition of the glossy magazine.

Although Tatler's readership is small, it represents one of the richest (and poshest) of any publication in the UK.

However, while threesomes might be becoming popular among the rich and titled, not everyone is a fan.

Rowan Pelling, former editor of Erotic Review and sex columnist, says: 'I tend to think that there's a sort of sexism at play.

'Most men are very keen on two women and a bloke, but not at all interested in two blokes and a woman (unless they happen to be a premier league footballer, that is).

'And then there's also the truth - in my observation of friends who've dabbled in them - that someone gets left out.

'I've seen couples invite another person in, only for one party in that couple to get carried away about the new individual, sometimes carrying on an affair behind their partner's back.

'Three is always a slightly unsatisfactory, someone's-left-out number. Just as three friends at school are always forming new dynamics and leaving someone out.'

Tatler was recently the star of a BBC2 documentary, Posh People: Inside Tatler which followed the workings of the historic magazine as editors and writers attempted to capture the upper class zeitgeist.
