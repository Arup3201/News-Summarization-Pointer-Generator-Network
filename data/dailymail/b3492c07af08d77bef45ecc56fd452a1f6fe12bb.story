Many parents dread the moment when they have to explain the birds and the bees to their children.

But in Emma Thompson’s case, they simply enlisted the help of a rather famous family friend.

When she was just eight years old, the 54-year-old was given a sex education lesson by legendary actor Alec Guinness.

The actress - who has previously admitted creating a ‘sex handbook’ for her own 13-year-old daughter - received a ‘calm and accurate response’ when she asked him for details, her mother has revealed.

Phyllida Law, who is also an actress, said she felt ‘faint’ at the time, but admitted she and her husband Eric were equally forthright when it came to educating their two daughters about the facts of life.

The 81-year-old told the Sunday Times Style magazine: ‘I think I drew pictures. My husband was blunt and I did the diagrams. I think we laughed.

‘Sex is ridiculous behaviour from adults who tell you not to pick your nose. Emma, aged eight, once asked Alec Guinness about the details and he gave her a calm and accurate response: very helpful, though I felt a bit faint.

‘Sophie, then five, listened gravely, fixing him with her headlamp eyes.’

In an interview last year Miss Thompson, who has won two Oscars and two Baftas, revealed she was sexually abused by a children’s magician at her eighth birthday party.

She said the ‘old man’ offered her a sweet before sticking his tongue down her throat, adding: ‘He gave me the sweet and said, “Will you give me a kiss?” and I said yes. So I went up to kiss him on the cheek and he planted his mouth on mine, stuck his tongue in my mouth and wiggled it about.

‘I thought it was my fault - children always think it’s their fault.’  Miss Thompson also said she had created a sex handbook to arm her daughter Gaia, 13, against material she might find on the internet.

She said: ‘I drew pictures and said, you know, you can sometimes feel things in your loins you don’t feel in your heart, and you need to look at that.

‘If you listen to what’s going on in your emotional language, you will be able to keep the sexual activities safe.’

Miss Law, whose most recent TV appearance was in ITV drama Foyle’s War, revealed her second daughter, actress Sophie Thompson, 52, has equally curious children.

She said: ‘My grandson Walter, while at school, did a picture of a lighthouse, which his teacher took to be quite another thing.

‘She was not amused. Such a pity. A good laugh with a teacher on this difficult subject would be very valuable. I think she missed a trick.
