A university student has shot dead a housemate and seriously wounded another before turning the gun on himself, police said today.Â 

The murder-suicide happened at 1am on Tuesday at a house close to the University of Maryland campus in College Park.

Davyon Green, 23, started several fires in the basement of the small property and in the yard. The flames awoke his two housemates who fled outside, where he opened fire on them with a handgun.

Ambush: An unidentified male student, who attends the University of Maryland, is taken to hospital following the murder-suicide at a home close to campus in the early hours on Tuesday

Loss of life: Davyon Green, 23, is believed to have shot dead one male roommate and injured another at their home in Prince George's County, Maryland

Stephen Alex Rane, 22, from Silver Springs, was shot where he stood while another young man was hit while running away.

The shooter then went to the backyard of the home where he committed suicide, Prince George's County police said.

Green was armed with an  Uzi submachine gun, a machete, baseball bat and ammunition along with the handgun with which he shot his victims, according to authorities.

Emergency: Fire crews attended the scene close to the college campus as the alleged shooter had set several small fires

Lock-down: The shooting occurred at 1am on Tuesday and emergency crews quickly swarmed the scene

Heavily armed: Green was armed with an Uzi sub-machine gun (stock image) but did not use the weapon police said

An official told the Washington Post that Green could have inflicted far more serious damage with the more high-powered weapon.

The victims names had not currently been released as police spoke to their families.

Students at the college were informed of the shooting via text message as the campus issued a high alert. Witnesses said that police were on the scene five minutes after the gunshots were heard.

The home is not part of university housing and the street is a mix of college students and families.
