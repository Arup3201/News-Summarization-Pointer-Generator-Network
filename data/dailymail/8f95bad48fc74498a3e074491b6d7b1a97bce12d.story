Manchester United's Angel di Maria has been voted Argentina's foreign-based player of the year by the country's sports journalists, beating Lionel Messi to the award.

Di Maria, who joined Louis van Gaal's side for a club record £60million fee this summer, won the Olimpia de Plata (Silver Olimpia award) at a ceremony on Tuesday after pipping Messi to the prize.

Di Maria helped former club Real Madrid win their 10th European Cup in May and Argentina reach the World Cup final, which he missed through injury, in Brazil and has made an impressive start to his career in England.

It is the first time Messi has failed to win the award since 2006, despite the Barcelona forward being named on the three-man shortlist to win the 2014 Ballon d'Or.

Striker Lucas Pratto of Velez Sarsfield won the equivalent for best player in the Argentine league.

Velez, announcing Pratto's award on their website (www.velezsarsfield.com.ar) on Wednesday, said the striker was on the verge of joining Brazil's Atletico Mineiro pending a medical.

Media reports have said Velez will receive £3.2m for Pratto, a high fee for a transfer between South American clubs.
