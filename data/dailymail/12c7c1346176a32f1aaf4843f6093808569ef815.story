Michael Jackson's former housekeeper has agreed to back in court a choreographer's claim that the pop superstar molested him in the shower when he was a boy, it has been claimed.

Blanca Francia, 57, says she walked in on The King of Pop showering with Australian Wade Robson, then eight, and has at last summoned up the courage to describe what she saw to a judge.

Robson, 30, claims he was abused by Jackson for seven years who told him he'd go 
to jail for the rest of his life if he told anyone about it.

The choreographer approached Ms Francia to testify at his abuse civil lawsuit last week, according to reports, but only now has she agreed to do so, claiming Jackson also abused her son, Jason.

She told the Daily Mirror: 'Michael Jackson abused Wade. My opinion has never wavered. We have been through a lot since then.

'They [Wade’s lawyers] would have to subpoena me to appear in the court case, but I would tell the same story. I will talk to them. I am still in shock that this has all happened.'

Lawsuit: Wade Robson, pictured yesterday with his family, has launched a civil lawsuit against Jackson's estate claiming he was abused and staff from the pop singer's company should have protected him

Support? Robson's lawyers are approaching Jackson's former maid Blanca Francia, left, to back him, according to reports. Robson denied her claims Jackson showered with him in the star's 2005 trial, right,

It is understood two other members of Jackson's staff have also emerged from the woodwork with claims the 'Smooth Criminal' singer behaved inappropriately when child visitors came to the house.

Personal maid Adrian McManus revealed staff talked openly  about Jackson’s bedtime antics with children while former ranch manager Mark Quindoy alleged he kissed a boy during a car trip in the early 1990s.

Robson's lawsuit is a change of tune for Robson who 
took to the stand as the first defense witness at a trial in 2005, where 
Jackson was accused of molesting 13-year-old cancer survivor Gavin Arvizo.

It was the same court case where Francia spoke out about seeing a young Robson in the shower with the singer.

'I walked in and they were in the shower,' Ms Francia told the court, according to a report from the time.

'When I saw it I saw clothes on the floor by the shower...underwear,' she said, adding that she recognized Jackson's and Robson's underclothes.

According to TMZ in the maid's full written testimony she said she couldn't see what was happening in the shower but could hear Jackson laughing.

Ms Francia's own son spoke at the court case in which Jackson was cleared of all 14 counts.

Robson is planning to argue that Michael Jackson's companies -- MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures -- had a duty to protect him.

However, his claims have been ridiculed by those close to the now deceased pop star.

Debbie Rowe, 54, the ex-wife and mother of two of Jackson's children, criticized Robson on Thursday.

Seven years of alleged abuse: Robson, pictured right with Jackson as a kid, said from the age of seven to around 14 Jackson 'performed sexual acts on me and forced me to perform sexual acts on him'

She called the choreographer 'opportunistic' and said he was seeking publicity.

She told TMZ on Thursday: 'It will be quickly forgotten, and will do nothing, nothing to tarnish Michael's extraordinary legacy.'

Jackson's estate has called the claims 'outrageous and pathetic' while Jermaine Jackson has said that Robson is 'full of s***'.

But Robson has been making his case too.

He appeared on the Today program this week for a lengthy interview on why he is coming forward now and to outline his claims.

He says from the age of seven to around 14, Jackson 'performed sexual acts on me and forced me to perform sexual acts on him'.

Robson told Today Jackson
 convinced him that 'both of us would go to jail for the rest of our 
lives' if he told anyone about what they had done together.

During the Arvizo case he adamantly denied that he had ever been molested or inappropriately 
touched by the singer.

Robson, now a top music choreographer
 who has worked with Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake, said he hadn't yet come to terms with 
what had happened to him.

'I said what I understood and I said what I was able to say,' he explained. 'From
 seven years old, from day one of the abuse, Michael told me that we 
loved each other and this was love, this was an expression of our love. 
And then he would follow it up with 'but if you ever tell anyone what we
 are doing both of our lives and careers would be over'.'

'This is not a case of repressed 
memory. I have never forgotten one moment of what 
Michael did to me, but I was psychologically and emotionally completely 
unable and unwilling to understand that it was sexual abuse.'

He said having his own child two 
years ago made him face up to the truth, as he said he couldn't help 
thinking about how he'd feel if a stranger molested his little boy.

'I'm a father and I became a father 
two and a half years ago to this beautiful baby boy and during the first
 18 months of his life I collapsed into two nervous breakdowns, 
terrifying nervous breakdowns,' he said.

Evidence: Jackson's case was backed by Robson at the star's 2005 trial, pictured entering court, over molestation claims

Idol: Robson, pictured as a young boy, was supported by Jackson who had him appear in numerous videos

'At that point, I had no idea what 
was going on. And for the first time in my life, I began to realize that
 my completely numb and unexplored feelings about what Michael did to me
 might be a problem and maybe I need to speak to somebody about it.'

He has asked a 
probate court to allow him to file a late creditor's claim against Jackson's 
estate, even though the deadline has passed for creditors to file such 
claims.

The estate's lawyer, Howard Weitzman, has dismissed Robson's claims.

In a statement Weitzman said:
 'This is a young man who has testified at least twice under oath over 
the past 20 years and said in numerous interviews that Michael Jackson 
never did anything inappropriate to him or with him.

'Now, nearly four years after Michael has passed, this sad and less-than-credible claim has been made.'.

Robson said the ordeal of launching such a public case was too great for it to be about money.

'The idea that I would make all of this up and put myself, 
my wife, my son, my entire family through this extremely stressful and 
painful experience all for money is incomprehensible,' he said.

'I've lived in silence and denial for 22 
years and I can't spend another moment in that... I'm never going to go 
away with this for the sake of money. I'm never going to be silenced for
 money. That's not going to happen.'

Robson's lawsuit comes as the high
 profile trial of Michael Jackson's tour promoter, AEG, continues.

The trial
 is brought by the singer's mother and children who claim AEG shares 
blame in his death for neglecting to vet and supervise Jackson's doctor,
 Dr Conrad Murray.

THEN

Wade Robson, who was then 22, testified in the Santa Maria courtroom that he was five when he met Jackson for the first time in his hometown, Brisbane, Australia.

Two years later, he was a guest at Jackson's Neverland ranch for the first of some 20-plus overnight visits. He told jurors he shared a bed with Jackson on numerous occasions from the ages of seven to 14, at Neverland, as well as apartments in Los Angeles and at hotels in Las Vegas and LA.

When asked by Jackson's lead lawyer, Thomas A. Mesereau Jr., whether he'd ever been molested by the singer Robson replied: 'Absolutely not,' before also denying strongly that Jackson had ever touched him in a sexually explicit way.

When senior deputy district attorney, Ronald J. Zonen, questioned Robson's account, he replied: 'I'm telling you, nothing ever happened.'

Zonen then said, according to a New York Times article at the time: 'You're saying nothing ever happened when you were awake,' to which Robson responded: 'I think something like that would wake me up.'

However, a former maid at Neverland who testified at the trial as a witness for the prosecution, said she had seen Jackson groping Robson in the shower at the ranch. But Robson denied ever having a shower with the star.

NOW

But now Robson is claiming Michael Jackson did in fact molest him, over a period of seven years.

In an interview with Today, Robson, 
now 30, labelled Jackson 'a pedophile and a child sexual abuser' who from the ages of seven to around 14 'performed sexual 
acts on me and forced me to perform sexual acts on him.'

He said that Jackson told him the alleged abuse was 
'an expression of our love.'

Robson added, explaining why he gave what he claims now was a false testimony: 'This is not a case of repressed 
memory. I have never forgotten one moment of what 
Michael did to me, but I was psychologically and emotionally completely 
unable and unwilling to understand that it was sexual abuse.'

But he said he was never offered money to deny the abuse during the trial.

'There was no money, there was no "you must lie." Michael, when he would talk to me before these things were going on, and he would call me everyday... it was complete manipulation and brainwashing. It wasn't any sense of the truth on the phone, he would role play with me and train me for these scenarios.'
