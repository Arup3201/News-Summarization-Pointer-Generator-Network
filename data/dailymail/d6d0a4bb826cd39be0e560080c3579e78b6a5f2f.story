Dream job: Charlotte Green will now announce the football scores on BBC Radio 5 Live

She left the BBC after fearing her voice was too posh. But now radio announcer Charlotte Green is to return to the corporation – to read the football scores.

In a move that could upset some of the sport’s more traditionalist fans, the 57-year-old will replace the renowned James Alexander Gordon on Radio 5 Live’s Sports Report.

She will become the first woman to read the classified football results, which are broadcast  at 5pm on Saturdays, when Gordon retires after 40 years on the programme.

Some listeners expressed mixed feelings when the decision was announced yesterday.

Writing on Twitter one fan said ‘Charlotte Green is a funny name for a bloke’ while another asked: ‘A woman? Reading the football?’

Others were more supportive and celebrated the appointment of a woman.

One posted: ‘Charlotte Green will be reading the football results on the BBC. Pack up, feminists, the war has been won.’

Miss Green, who supports Tottenham Hotspur, read the news on Radio 4 before taking voluntary redundancy in January.

After she left, she revealed she felt she was too posh for the channel, saying: ‘Received pronunciation, or accent-less accent, is on the wane.

The BBC’s days of employing people who sound like me are more or less over.’

The veteran broadcaster will be the first woman to read the BBC Radio 5 Live football results

The presenter, who went on to be the 
voice of a Classic FM programme called Charlotte Green’s Great 
Composers, described her new post – revealed by Charles Sale in 
Sportsmail yesterday – as a ‘dream come true’ and ‘an honour’.

She said: ‘I’m delighted to be offered this opportunity as I’ve been a football fan all my life.

Passing on the torch: Miss Green will take over from James Alexander Gordon, who has read the scores out for more than 40 years

'In fact as a six year old I used to 
sit at the dining room table reading the football scores out loud from 
the newspaper so this really is a dream come true.

'It is a huge honour to take over from James Alexander Gordon.’

Miss Green, who once famously had an uncontrollable giggling fit in the middle of reading a Today programme bulletin, will join the Sports Report programme in September.

Announcing her appointment, Richard Burgess, Head of BBC Radio Sport, said: ‘We are delighted to welcome Charlotte to 5 Live and we are really looking forward to hearing her distinctive voice reading the classifieds, made so famous by James Alexander Gordon.

'She is a broadcaster of true calibre and I know she will bring clarity and warmth to the role.’

Her appointment comes after the BBC’s only female cricket commentator, Alison Mitchell, was denied the chance to commentate on the Ashes.

She has appeared on programmes to do with the contest, but never actually  provided commentary on Test Match Special.
