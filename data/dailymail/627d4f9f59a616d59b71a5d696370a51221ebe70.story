They already enjoy massages, nap rooms, free gourmet food and one paid day every week to focus on personal projects.

Now the pampered employees of internet giant Google can add a private ferry service to their envy-inducing list of workplace perks.

While others endure long commutes through heavy traffic every morning, lucky Googlers can step aboard the Google boat to be whisked effortlessly across San Fransisco Bay to the firm's California HQ near Redwood city.

All aboard: Internet giant Google has chartered a private ferry to take employees from San Fransisco to their headquarters near Redwood City

The search engine has chartered passenger catamaran the Triumphant to take up to 150 workers from San Fransisco to Redwood with two services every workday morning and evening.

Then from Redwood it's just a short hop to the rapidly expanding Googleplex headquarters at Mountain View.

The firm has long been operating a large fleet of shuttle buses for their staff which have become a common sight on the streets of San Fransisco.

Destination: The internet giant's rapidly expanding Calfornia Headquarters named Googleplex

But the gleaming vehicles have have been angering many San Fransisco residents who see them as a symbol of the gap between the haves and the have nots and complain they should not be allowed to use the city's public bus stops.

Recently the shuttle buses have been targetted of protesters, demonstrating over rapidly rising property prices and a spate of evictions across the city. 

A Google spokesman said in a statement: 'We certainly donâ€™t want to cause any inconvenience to SF residents and weâ€™re trying alternative ways to get Googlers to work.'

The catamaran is part of a pilot program which the technology giant kicked off this week.
