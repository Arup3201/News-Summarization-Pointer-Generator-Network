The sharp increase in house prices comes amid growing concern that Government schemes to boost the housing market may be fuelling another house price bubble

The average asking price of a home in England and Wales has jumped by around £20,000 since the beginning of the year, a report reveals today.

A typical home advertised for sale in an estate agent’s window now has a price tag of £250,000, equal to nearly ten times the average full-time salary in this country.

The sharp increase comes amid growing concern that Government schemes to boost the housing market may be fuelling another house price bubble.

At the beginning of January the report, from the property website Rightmove, reveals the average asking price was £228,989. Today it is £249,199, a jump of £20,210.

In London, the affordability crisis facing anybody wanting to get onto the housing ladder, or move to a larger home, is even more acute.

The average asking price in London hit £501,067 this month [aug], compared to £454,875 in the same month last year, according to Rightmove.

Miles Shipside, director of Rightmove, called on ministers to ensure ‘an unsustainable boom in property prices’ is not created by their recent interventions.

He said: ‘It is now critical that the supply of property improves so that the goal of a significant increase in transaction numbers is not over-shadowed by an unsustainable boom in property prices.’

Since April, a scheme called Help to Buy helps people with a small deposit of five per cent to buy a new-build property for up to £600,000. They are given a five-year interest-free loan for up 20 per cent of the property price.

From January, another scheme, which confusingly is also called Help to Buy, will allow people with the same small deposit to buy a home, with the Government providing a guarantee to the mortgage lender of up to 15 per cent of the loan. This scheme will apply to old properties as well as new properties.

The Institute of Directors slammed the
new Help to Buy scheme as ‘very dangerous’, while the consultancy 
Capital Economics said it is ‘ropey economics’ but added it may be ‘more
successful politically.’

Rightmove
said it is ‘already seeing early signs of demand outstripping supply’, a
problem which Britain’s housing market has faced for many years to the 
fury of housing campaigners.

The housing charity Shelter says 250,000 new homes are needed every year, but only 106,820 were completed between May 2012 and June 2013, according to the Government’s figures.

Kay Boycott, a director of Shelter, said: ‘Unless we see radical action from the government to tackle our chronic shortage of homes, house prices and rents will quickly rise even further out of reach for millions of people across the country struggling to find a stable home of their own.’

Overall, the Rightmove figures show the average asking price has risen by 5.5 per cent over the last year, although it fell by 1.8 per cent in August.

The asking price of the average flat has reached an all-time record of £209,652, compared to £188,445 for a terraced property, £204,392 for a semi-detached home and £364,254 for a detached house.
