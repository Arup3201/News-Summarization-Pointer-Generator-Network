Tipping the scales at just four-and-a-half stone, 35-year-old anorexic Tricia Webb's life was in serious danger.

But her 20-year battle against the eating disorder was given a boost when she adopted four Cavalier King Charles spaniels, which she says, gave her a reason to live.

Now, she has turned her life around and has gained three stone - all thanks to the dogs, named Tyler, Bodie, Max and Sam.

Reason to live: Tricia says the dogs gave her a reason to carry on and wouldn't have made it without them

'My dogs are my life - they brought me back from the dead,' explains the recovering anorexic who hails from Middlesbrough.

'Without their regular visits, and their compassion and love, I simply wouldn’t have made it. They were my goal from beginning to end - to see them and to stay alive for them.'

Tricia, who has owned the dogs, all aged between seven and nine years old, even told concerned doctors that she knew she would pull through because of her cherished canines.

'When I was in hospital, the doctors would ask me "what’s your goal or reason for recovery?" I would always say ‘my dogs are my goal’.”

Tricia now weighs seven stone and has been out of hospital for a year - the longest she has ever managed without an admission.

Her illness began when she was a teenager and she started skipping meals while working busy shifts at a hair dressing salon.

But the illness soon began to take a toll as her weight plummeted to six-and-a-half stone and her hair began falling out.

Her parents Cath, 64, and Keith, 66, took her to see their GP who said it was just a phase. But when the weight continued to drop off her already skeletal frame she was diagnosed with anorexia and admitted to hospital.

'I never intended not to eat. I just never felt hungry and I was so busy that I didn’t consider what it was doing to me,' reveals Tricia.

'I was never a typical anorexic because it wasn’t that I didn’t want to eat, I just forgot, and then it got to the point where I couldn’t eat.

'It wasn’t until I was admitted to hospital that I decided if everyone thought I was anorexic, I may as well act like it.'

And act like it she did, with the result that her weight plummeted to less than five stone. And worse was to come.

By now seriously ill, she collapsed in the snow one Christmas and broke her shoulder before being re-admitted to hospital.

'If I hadn’t broken my arm then I probably would have died, as I would never have willingly gone back to hospital,' she admits.

But even that wasn't enough of a wake-up call and she endured three further relapses before checking herself into The Retreat rehab centre in York.

At the clinic, she was given a private room and felt in control of her own recovery, both of which, she says, made a difference - but her dogs were her main inspiration.

'They were brought in to see me and each time they left they would put their noses up to the glass, spurring me on to get better.'

'I’ve had them since they were pups, and they are my babies. Whenever I have been low, it is my dogs that have helped me bounce back.

'I talk to them about my problems - and obviously I can trust them not to tell anyone!'Although one, Tyler, sadly died from cancer in August, Tricia says her recovery is continuing apace.

'I just need to remember that I have three others - and of course my parents - for support.'
