Romelu Lukaku insists he is hoping to stay at Chelsea next season, despite uncertainty surrounding his future at Stamford Bridge.

The Belgium striker joined Chelsea in 2011 but has spent the last two seasons on loan - with West Brom and Everton respectively - and manager Jose Mourinho is reportedly prepared to sell to anyone willing to meet their £25million valuation.

However, the 21-year-old is determined to fight for his place at a club where he has only started a single Premier League game and is yet to score a goal.

'It would be nice to get clarity 
beforehand, but that will not happen, so I'm completely focused on the 
World Cup,' Lukaku told Het Nieuwsblad.

'You know, I still have a
 two-year contract at the biggest club in England, because that's 
Chelsea. So I still hope to play there. Chelsea have a good coach.'

Lukaku scored 15 league goals for Everton last season and, although manager Roberto Martinez would be interested in making the move permanent, the Toffees have been put off by Chelsea's asking price.
