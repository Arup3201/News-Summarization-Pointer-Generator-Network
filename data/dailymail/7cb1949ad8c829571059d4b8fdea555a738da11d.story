Discover some of Sydney's most iconic treasures, as over 50 most private buildings open for just one day of urban exploration.

On Sunday, Sydney Living Museums is unlocking the doors to the city for it's 10th Sydney Open, allowing City Pass holders the opportunity to gain exclusive access to some of the most incredible buildings in Sydney's CBD and Darlinghurst. 

Participants will be allowed entry into some of Sydney's latest award-winning architecture, underground tunnels, towers, roof gardens and stunning penthouses with panoramic views.

Some of the buildings include Eternity Playhouse theatre - that was once a church, Queen Victoria Building, Anzac Memorial, 50 Martin Place Rooftop and St James' Church Crypt. 

Sydney Open is a self guided experience, where visitors can make their way through particular spaces of interest.

The event also allows explorers to venture behind the scenes for Focus Tours and gain access to some of Sydney's most private spaces, such as the Sky Garden in Broadway, Sydney's CBD.

Sydney Living Museums aims to enrich and engage people through the living history hidden in Sydney's city.

By bringing these private and ancient spots to life, visitors are able to experience Sydney's past in the present. 

Sydney Open will begin on Sunday at 9:30am to 5pm.
