A daredevil Finn has set a new world record for the fastest car on ice, reaching a confirmed speed of over 208mph.

The new record was set by Janne 'Iceman' Laitinen on an 7.5-mile track carved into the frozen seas of the Gulf of Bothnia, near the city of Oulu.

He broke the record in an
Audi RS6 fitted with a new type of street-legal studded tyre.

Ice-driving: A new world record has been set for
the fastest car on ice, with Finnish test driver Janne Latinen reaching
over 208mph in an Audi RS6 fitted with a new kind of street-legal 
studded tyres

Zoom: The new record beats the previous, also set my Mr Laitinen, by just over two miles per hour

Skids: In the latest attempt Mr Laitinen in fact
reached speeds of over 211mph, but an average was taken of speeds down 
two runs of the kilometre long track

Mr Laitinen, already a multiple record holder, reached the phenomenal speed in an
Audi RS6 fitted with a new type of street-legal ultra-low profile 
studded tyres developed by Finnish firm Nokian Tyres.

The Guiness World Records organisation stipulates that driving ice-speed records must be set using commercially available tyres approved for road use in the country where the record is made.

The new record beats the previous one, also set by Mr Laitinen in the same car and also using tyres made by Nokian, by just over two miles per hour.

Mr Laitinen also holds the world record for speed while driving on ice in an electric car, reaching a speed of just over 156mph in March 2012 driving a prototype vehicle.

In the latest attempt he in fact reached speeds of over 211mph, but Guinness rules specify that the speed down the one-kilometre (0.62 mile) track be measured in both directions and the record is an average of time each way.

The vehicle takes a flying start on the track, which must be natural and not roughened or chemically treated, and the allowed time to achieve the record is only one hour.

Studded: The tyres used to achieve the new 
record were Nokian's latest Hakkapeliitta 8 studded tyre, which are 
designed for balanced lateral and longitudinal grip

Useful up north: The company says this helps drivers to get 'stable and predictable handling' at 'extreme speeds on uneven ice as well as during regular overtaking on winter roads'

Frozen wastes: The vehicle takes a flying start

treated, and the allowed time to achieve the record is only one hour

Nokian's technical customer service manager Matti Morri said: 'At extreme speeds, the forces focused on the tyres are 
enormous, as the car travels over 93 metres per second and the studs hit
the ice 43 times'

The tyres used to achieve the new 
record were Nokian's latest Hakkapeliitta 8 studded tyre, which are 
designed for balanced lateral and longitudinal grip.

The Guinness organisation defines specific rules for the world record for driving on ice.

The
company says this helps drivers to get 'stable and predictable 
handling' at 'extreme speeds on uneven ice as well as during regular 
overtaking on winter roads.'

As the world's northernmost tyre 
manufacturer, Nokian has form in creating tyres for running on ice. The 
company developed and manufactured the worldâ€™s first winter tyre for the
winter frost in 1934.

Matti Morri, technical customer service manager for Nokian Tyres, said: 'Relentless testing at the extreme limits always works to serve the interests of the consumer.

'We wanted to set an extremely tough challenge for the new Hakkapeliitta 8.

'At extreme speeds, the forces focused on the tyres are enormous, as the car travels over 93 metres per second and the studs hit the ice 43 times.

'As the air resistance increases, we need even more grip to accelerate the car. In addition to grip, handling and stability are also essential.'
