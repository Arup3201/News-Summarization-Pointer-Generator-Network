Businessman Donald Trump and comedian Russell Brand engaged in a nasty Twitter spat on Thursday.

The digital fight started when Trump tweeted that the Forgetting Sarah Marshall star is a 'major loser.' Brand, however, hit back - and eventually suggested that Trump is not the entrepreneur he has claimed to be, by linking to an an article that mentioned his multi-million dollar inheritance and financial aid from the US government.

'I watched Russell Brand @rustyrockets on the @jimmyfallon show the other night—what the hell do people see in Russell—a major loser!' Trump first wrote.

Trump's comments came three days after Brand appeared on 'Late Show with David Letterman' on Monday. Brand is not scheduled as a guest this week on 'The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon'.

Attack: Donald Trump called comedian Russell Brand 'a major loser' on Twitter Thursday 

Split: Pop star Katy Perry and Russell Brand were married in 2010 and legally divorced in 2012  

Insult: Trump posted this message slamming Brand on Tuesday 

Trump then published another tweet, which read '.@katyperry must have been drunk when she married Russell Brand @rustyrockets – but he did send me a really nice letter of apology!'

It was not immediately clear what 'letter of apology' Trump was referring to.  

Perry and Brand were married in 2010 and divorced two years later, with Perry telling Vogue in June 2013 that Brand announced his intention to divorce in a 2011 New Year's Eve text message.

Brand soon retaliated and responded to Trump's second message with jokes about Trump's sobriety and his much-lampooned hairline.

'.@realDonaldTrump are you drunk when you write these tweets? Or does that foam you spray on your bald head make you high?' he tweeted.

Brand later tweeted '.@realDonaldTrump I don't think your daddy left you any witty ripostes, and everything you have you inherited.'

Included in that tweet was a link to an excerpt from 'The Self-Made Myth: The Truth About How Government Helps Individuals and Businesses Succeed' - which disputed Trump's image that he independently built a real estate empire.

Trump inherited between $40million and $200million from his father Fred Trump - who himself received government funds in both the Great Depression and World War Two for projects, according to the excerpt.

Counterattack: Brand replied to Trump's message about his marriage to Katy Perry with jokes about Trump's sobriety and his hairline

Strike back: Brand eventually linked to an an article that mentioned Trump's multimillion-dollar from his father inheritance and financial aid from the US government

 Fighting words: Brand also linked to a second article which slammed Trump on several fronts 

When Donald Trump was head of The Trump Organization in 1990 and the company faced a $5billion debt, 'The survival of the company was made possible only by a bailout pact agreed upon in August of that same year by some 70 banks, allowing Trump to defer on nearly $1 billion in debt, as well as to take out second and third mortgages on almost all of his properties,' the book excerpt argued. 'If it were not for the collective effort of all banks and parties involved in that 1990 deal, Trump’s business would have gone bankrupt and failed.'

Brand later tweeted '.@realDonaldTrump Also -' and included a link to an April 2011 opinion article from The Atlantic which slammed Trump on several fronts.

That article quoted 'a former Deutsche Bank employee familiar with Trump from this $640-million deal gone awry on the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago. Trump was sued to collect on a $40-million personal guarantee that was part of the deal.'

Direct address: Trump tweeted at Katy Perry 'I watched Russell Brand and I think his mind is fried - he looks really bad. Russell is a total joke, a dummy who is lost!'

Trump went on to Tweet at Perry following Brand's links 

Silence: Perry has so far not responded to the feud on Twitter

'[The Chicago deal] was pretty minor given all the other things going on at the time,' the ex-employee told The Atlantic. 'Real estate developers do default from time to time. But this guy has been doing it for 20 years, failing. Remember the Trump Shuttle? That's why he'll never run. His finances just won't hold up to scrutiny. It's pretty well known in financial circles that this guy is a deadbeat.'

Included in the piece was an April 2011 NBC report around the time Trump considered running for president, which reported Trump had faced multiple casino bankruptcies and lawsuits from various business ventures.

Following Brand's tweets, Trump later pulled Perry more directly into the spat, writing '.@katyperry Katy, what the hell were you thinking when you married loser Russell Brand. There is a guy who has got nothing going, a waste!'

He also tweeted '.@katyperry I watched Russell Brand and I think his mind is fried - he looks really bad. Russell is a total joke, a dummy who is lost!'

Perry has so far not responded to the feud on Twitter.
