Republicans hoping to use Benghazi as a cudgel against Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she runs for President in 2016 may be out of luck, a new Fox News poll suggests.

Released Wednesday, the poll asks respondents a number of questions about Clinton, including whether they think she is responsible for deaths of four Americans killed in the September 11, 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack. It also asks if they think Clinton is 'honest and trustworthy.'

Despite the negative attention Clinton received throughout last year for her role in the administration's failure to prevent the deaths and it's subsequent botched response to the attack, Clinton's favorability ratings outpace those of her main 2016 rivals.

Hillary Clinton gets favorable marks from Americans despite her association with the Benghazi terrorist attacks

Just over a year ago, Clinton resigned from her cabinet-level position amidst Congressional hearings into Benghazi. As if the physical attack on Benghazi wasn't bad enough, Clinton floundered in the face of Congress, shouting out the now infamous line 'what difference at this point does it make' when pressed about the cause of the attack.

'The fact is we had four dead Americans! Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided theyâ€™d go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make?' Clinton said while testifying at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on January 23, 2013.

'What difference at this point does it make?' U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton infamously shouted at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 23, 2013

Not much, it would seem.

Clinton's outburst has lost much of its initial sting, based on respondent's answers to Fox's poll.

While respondents do not think the Obama administration is being 'open and transparent' about the Benghazi, when directly asked if they blame Clinton for what happened, responses were mixed, with only a combined total of 55 percent of respondents placing any blame whatsoever on her.

Fox's recent poll is not an anomaly. The news company's polls show that furor over Benghazi has steadily declined in the last year.

During a Q and A earlier this year, Clinton acknowledged Benghazi as her 'biggest regret' during her tenure as Secretary of State, and she is expected to discuss the scandal in further detail in her upcoming memoir, Hard Choices.

The book, the title of which was just released today, will hit the shelves on June 10.

'The hard questions are not, "Do you want to be president?" "Can you win?" ' Clinton said during a recent speech.'The hard questions are, "Why?

Why would you want to do this?" and "What? What could you offer that could make a difference?" '

Republicans have continued to make Benghazi an issue. On Thursday, Georgia Rep. Lynn Westmoreland told a blogger for United Liberty that a group of nine House Republicans, including himself, have been reviewing congressional testimony on the attacks from various witnesses to look for 'any contradictions in testimonies.'

While not expressly named by Westmoreland, Clinton's testimony is undoubtedly on the group's list to review.

'Benghazi happened on her watch, so she will always have a connection to the attack,' a former spokesperson for Clinton at state, told The Washington Times last week. 'There have been some efforts to make it about her, which I suspect will continue despite the lack of evidence.'

In Fox's poll, a majority of respondents said they thought Congress should continue investigatating the Obama administration's roll in the Benghazi terrorist attack, and 61 percent said they still believe the Obama administration is engaged in a cover-up.

The percentage of Americans who believe the administration is lying about Benghazi remains steadfast, but the percentage who believe Congress should continue its investigation has significantly decreased since June of last year. Then, 73 percent of respondents wanted Congress to continue 'until lawmakers feel they know the truth.'Now, only 60 percent say the same thing.

The poll surveyed roughly the same number of Republicans and Democrats and it contained similar percentages of both compared to previous Fox News polls on these issues.

In a potential match up against New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, two politicians who ranked highest on Republican respondents' 2016 wish list, Clinton would beat both by a solid eight to nine points, the poll found.

On the issue of trust, 54 percent said Clinton was 'honest and trustworthy' compared with Christie, who has taken a public relations flogging in recent months over the Bridgegate scandal, whom only 41 percent said they trusted. Jeb Bush didn't fare much better, with only 49 percent giving him positive marks in the trust category.

Clinton's favorability rating is at its lowest point since 2008, but she she outpaced President Barack Obama, Jeb Bush and high-profile Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, two more likely 2016 candidates.

'Polls don't matter much at all right now - what's most important is that there are millions of Americans in all corners of the country who are ready to help her win if she decides to run,' Ready for Hillary communications director Seth Bringman told MailOnline in an email. 'Poll numbers could change, but the enthusiasm of her supporters and the list of grassroots supporters can only grow.'

While it's still early to be making blanket statements about the 2016 presidential election, it's clear that Benghazi won't have the thrust Republicans hoped it would. Should Clinton decide to run, Republicans will need to find a fresh angle on the issue to attack Clinton from or dig up new dirt.
