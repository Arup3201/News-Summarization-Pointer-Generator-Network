Nigel Evans has resigned as Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons after it emerged he will be charged with a series of sex offences against seven men.

The 55-year-old Tory, who said he will continue to represent his Ribble Valley constituency in Lancashire but as an independent MP, was told he will stand trial accused of eight offences, the most serious of which carries a maximum life penalty.

The decision to charge the openly-gay politician – a popular figure in Westminster – came after he was arrested for a third time yesterday morning.

Charged: Nigel Evans seen leaving Preston Police Station after being questioned for over 12 hours. The 55-year-old Tory MP has been charged with eight alleged sexual offences against seven men

In the House of Commons today, Speaker John Bercow thanked Mr Evans for being 'highly competent, fair and good-humoured'

He added: 'He has been a loyal and valued member of the team of deputy speakers who assist me in chairing our proceedings. I am warmly grateful to him.'

Last night Evans was charged with the 
rape of a man between March 29 and April 1, 2013, five sexual assaults 
dating back to 2009 and two indecent assaults dating back to 2002.

Evans
 dismissed the original allegations against him as ‘completely false’, 
and said they had been made by two people he had ‘regarded as friends’.

In
 June, after his second arrest, he said: ‘I continue to refute all 
allegations.’

Evans has now resigned from his Speaker duties, but last 
night said he would ‘robustly’ fight to prove his innocence from the 
back benches.

After spending more than 12 hours in custody, he joked to reporters about the darkened sky: ‘Is it still Tuesday?’

He continued: ‘May I assure everyone at this time that I will robustly defend my innocence.

‘I have today answered bail following complaints I have said were incredulous.

‘While
 I am saddened this case has not been closed today I am certain of two 
things – firstly that I am innocent, and secondly that my innocence will
 be demonstrated.

'Having informed my fellow deputy speakers Lindsay Hoyle and Dawn Primarolo, my association chairman and my staff, I can confirm I will now resign as Deputy Speaker.

'However I will continue to work hard for the people of the Ribble Valley from the back benches where I first started my political career in 1992.'

He added that he 'will not be making any further comment until after the case concludes.'

Director 
of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC said: ‘Following an 
investigation by Lancashire police, the Crown Prosecution Service has 
received a file of evidence in the case of Mr Nigel Evans MP which 
concerns allegations of a sexual nature.

'After careful consideration, we
 have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and that it is in the 
public interest to prosecute Mr Evans.’

Evans
 was detained and quizzed on fresh allegations of indecent assault and 
sexual touching against two men in their 20s when he answered bail at 
Preston police station yesterday. 

He
 had previously been arrested by Lancashire Police on suspicion of rape,
 sexual assault and three indecent assaults against five men, also all 
in their 20s.

Evans’s 
initial arrest in early May related to offences alleged to have been 
committed in Pendleton, Lancashire, between July 2009 and March 2013.

The
 three counts of indecent assault, over which he was arrested in June, 
are alleged to have happened in Blackpool and London between 2003 and 
2011.

The two fresh allegations he was quizzed over yesterday related to alleged incidents in London between 2002 and 2009.

His
 trial is expected to take place next spring or early summer, something 
which will be will be of major concern for Tory strategists with a 
General Election looming in 2015.

He
 was one of three deputy speakers elected in a secret ballot of MPs in 
2010. Later that year, in an article in The Mail on Sunday, he came out 
as gay, saying that he was ‘tired of living a lie’.

He had in the past received threats of blackmail from political enemies threatening to expose him, he said.

Evans
 was brought up on a Swansea council estate and worked in his parents’ 
shop before studying politics at Swansea University.  He joined the 
Conservative Party when he was 16.

His
 career in politics began when became a councillor in 1985. He won 
Ribble Valley for the Tories in the 1992 General Election.

Evans will appear before Preston magistrates on September 18.

This morning Evans’s constituency association chairman backed him over his sex assault allegations and said local Tories would continue to support him.

Michael Ranson said: ‘Ribble Valley Conservative Association is disappointed that the CPS have indicated that they have charged our MP Nigel Evans with rape and other sexual offences.

‘Nigel has strongly denied all the offences and has said that he will vigorously defend them - in the United Kingdom a person is presumed innocent until he is found guilty in a court of law and we will continue to support Nigel at this very difficult time.

‘We understand that Nigel has resigned as deputy speaker and will return to the backbenches where he will continue to represent the people of the Ribble Valley as he has done for the last 20 years.

‘He will hold regular surgeries and deal with the usual heavy caseload of constituents’ problems.

‘We hope that the case will come to court as soon as possible so that the uncertainty hanging over Nigel and the constituency can be quickly resolved.’
