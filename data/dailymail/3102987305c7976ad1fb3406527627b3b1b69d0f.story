It's fondly remembered as the classic bodice-ripper, with millions of television viewers in the 1970s enthralled by scenes of passion and adventure played out against a backdrop of windswept Cornish landscapes.

And now, the BBC's new adaptation of Winston Graham's Poldark novels is again set to shock viewers – but this time because of a lack of sex scenes and nudity.

Debbie Horsfield, the acclaimed dramatist who has written the new series, said: 'I am always fascinated by the way Poldark is described as a bodice-ripper.

'There don't seem to be any bodices being ripped in the original material and this new series is very much an adaptation of the source material.'

Horsfield's comments might reassure fans of Graham's 12 Poldark books but will surprise fans of The Hobbit star Aidan Turner, cast as the brooding Captain Ross Poldark in the 2015 adaptation.

They have welcomed a 'sexy and steamy' trailer for the show which shows 'a buffed' Turner topless and then has him swimming naked in the sea. One wrote online: 'OMG, Aidan Turner has made me feel things again!' while another added: 'I have Turner fever!'

But Horsfield, who created the hairdressing drama Cutting It, said the trailer, which has been shown frequently on the BBC, wasn't necessarily typical of the drama to follow. 

She said: 'I can't comment on what choices are made for a trailer. I don't think you will be seeing those sorts of scenes every few seconds. My view is that less is more.'

The Mail on Sunday has seen the first episode of the new adaptation and can confirm there is no actual nudity. The new series will not be short of romance and intrigue, however, as it focuses on an 18th Century love triangle involving Poldark, his former fiancee Elizabeth and the servant girl Demelza whom he eventually marries.

The new series will inevitably be compared with the previous adaptation which caused a sensation when it was broadcast from 1975 to 1977.

That version, which starred Robin Ellis as Poldark, Jill Townsend as Elizabeth and Angharad Rees as Demelza, proved to be a ratings hit and is still considered one of the best television dramas ever made.

But Horsfield said she didn't give it a second thought when she started work on her own adaptation, which has Eleanor Tomlinson and Heida Reed in the roles of Demelza and Elizabeth respectively.

She said: 'I know there is a certain generation that watched the 1970s version. I just wanted to convey the complexity of the story telling. I didn't think of the earlier version when I was writing it. We are sticking much more closely to the novels. The 1970s adaptation diverged quite considerably.'

The new eight-part series, which will be shown on BBC1 on Sunday nights, is based on Graham's first two novels. But the BBC hopes to adapt all 12 books if audiences warm to the story.

The original series only covered the first seven novels although ITV did adapt the eighth in 1996.
