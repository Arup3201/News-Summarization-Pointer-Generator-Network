The vast majority of Britons would prefer to go without sex than live without their mobile phones, a survey suggests.

Two thirds of young Britons claim that they ‘couldn’t live without their phone’ and nine per cent of people polled said they'd rather go without their own children than part with their gadgets.

More than 2,570 adults across the UK, aged between 18 and 30, took part in the survey by Mobileinsurance.co.uk.

The survey found that 9% of UK adults would rather live without their own children for a week than give up their mobile phone, while 53% of those polled admitted they were addicted to their handsets

During the study, 2,571 adults were asked what would they rather live without than their mobile phone.

The top 10 items were:

1. Sex – 94%

2. TV/Film – 82%

3. Car – 71%

4. My partner – 62%

5. Bed – 55%

6. Money – 47%

7. Basic meals – 45%

8. House – 32%

9. Any other human contact – 23%

10. Own children – 9%

It found that 94 per cent of people in the UK would rather live 
without sex than their mobile phones.

All of those questioned owned mobile phones and were in a relationship.

When asked to describe how they felt about their mobile phone, 65 per cent claimed they ‘couldn’t live without it’.

Almost a quarter, 22 per cent, said they were ‘very dependent’ on their 
handset, while 10 per cent felt they could ‘take or leave’ their mobile phone.

Just one per cent said they only needed their handsets occasionally and a further 2 per cent said they 
could ‘easily live without it’.

And despite the reliance most of the people studied put on their phones, just 12 per cent said they have mobile phone insurance to protect their must-have gadget. 

The research also asked the participants what they would rather live without for a week, than give up their mobile phone.

Despite 65 per cent of people claiming they couldn't live without their handsets, only 12 per cent had mobile insurance

The poll also found that 45 per cent of those questioned would rather live without ‘basic meals’, 71 per cent said that they would be willing to forgo their car and 9 per cent would rather live without their own children than be parted from their handset.
