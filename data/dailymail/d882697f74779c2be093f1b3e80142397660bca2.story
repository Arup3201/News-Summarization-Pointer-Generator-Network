A book that was given to Richard III as a teenager has gone on public display for the first time since it was written 550 years ago.

The signed book is one of only 13 of Richard III's books that is known to still exist. It is especially valuable as he has signed it 'R Gloucester' as he was only the Duke of Gloucester as a young man.

The rare book was rediscovered in a library at Longleat House in Wiltshire.

Rare manuscript: Richard III's book contains tales of chivalry, classical history, and two of the less bawdy Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer

King Richard III: A hand-written book, believed to be made in York in the 15th century, has been uncovered at Longleat House in Wiltshire

It features a signature by Richard, 
whose remains were found in a car park in Leicester last year, 
527 years after his death.

Books like this containing chivalric tales were given to nobles as part of their education.

Above his signature in the book he wrote the words 'Tant le desieree', which means 'So much desired'.

Historians say the motto was a chivalristic code the young duke might have adopted for tournaments.

Richard, who was the Duke of Gloucester at the time, would have been received it in his early teens.

As the fourth son of the Duke of 
York, he received the education of a future cleric and was more 
competent in Latin than most of his peers.

The
book has been at Longleat since Thomas Thynne, the First Viscount 
Weymouth, bought it in 1709 along with several other medieval 
manuscripts.

Signed by Richard III as a teenager: One of only 13 surviving books personally owned by Richard III, which he signed 'R Gloucester' in his role as Duke of Gloucester

Dr Kate Harris, curator at Longleat 
House, said: 'It is a fascinating piece of history. His handwriting is 
extremely competent, which shows he was highly educated.'

'Within the book are tales of derring-do, as well as classical Greek and Rome.'

'Most of the books of the time were in French and Latin, so this one is unusual.'

Dr Harris is curious as to why Richard signed the book in the middle, instead of at the beginning or at the end, which is more traditional.

'He may have done it as a security measure.

'If you sign your signature at the beginning or end it is easy for somebody else to tear it out.

But you can't tear out a page from the middle of a book.'

Although he has gone down in history as a hunchbacked tyrant, most historians now say that image is fictitious.

Richard's modern day image is down largely to his portrayal by William Shakespeare.

Richard's body, which was found in a shallow grave in a Leicester car park last year, is expected to finally have a proper burial at a tomb in Leicester Catherdal.
