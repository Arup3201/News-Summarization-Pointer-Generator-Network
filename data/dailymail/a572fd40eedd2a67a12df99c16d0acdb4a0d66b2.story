Watching Friends is like stepping back into the Nineties, a time before mobile phones and selfie sticks were the norm.

But a funny new video re-imagines the sitcom in a modern setting, with some hilarious results.

In the clip, Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Ross, Chandler and Joey are replaced by a group of six modern-day selfie-taking 20-somethings dressed in hipster clothes.

In the show's iconic theme tune montage, instead of dancing around a fountain together, they all focus on their phones, texting and striking a pose as they absentmindedly take pictures of themselves.

Even when they jauntily pop open their colourful umbrellas as with the original credits, their eyes remain glued to their smartphones.

And instead of the classic single I'll Be There For You by The Rembrandts, this rebooted version, created by Nerdist, features an edgy remix.

The lyrics play off the original refrain but add in updated lyrics addressing the current vogue for online dating, going dairy-free or, like Beyonce, opting for a 'plant-based' diet.

The song begins: 'No one told you life was gonna be this way, your Tinder profile sucks and you spilled your almond milk latte.

'Feels like everyone's growing out their beard and your roommate's going vegan while you're drinking gluten-free beer.'

The song then mentions the greatest difference between Friends then and now - mobile phones.

'I'll be there for you, if you shoot me a text first.

'I'll be there for you, taking phone calls is the worst.

'I'll be there for you, but my battery's really low.'

The modern-day Friends stars have a brand new favourite locale, too - a  cafe called Woodcat, with minimal decor and exposed lightbulbs adding to its overdone hipster charm

The video has been viewed more than 350,000 times since it was posted on YouTube last week.'It's so depressing but so true,' one commenter said of the Friends reboot

The modern-day Friends stars have a brand new favourite locale, too - a cringingly cool cafe called Woodcat, with minimal decor and exposed lightbulbs adding to its overdone hipster charm.

While the original Friends cast cracked jokes and watched Phoebe sing during their Central Perk sessions, this group simply continues to stare at their phones, completely uninterested in one another.

The video has been viewed more than 350,000 times since it was posted on YouTube last week.

'It's so depressing but so true,' one commenter said of the Friends reboot. Another wrote: 'Sad but true. Good Job! I laughed!'

Friends isn't the only show Nerdist has parodied; the group releases a new comedy video covering different areas of pop culture on their YouTube channel every two weeks.
