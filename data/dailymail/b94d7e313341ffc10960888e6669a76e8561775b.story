Facing jail: Karl Lang, pictured, has been warned he could be sent to prison for the crimes against vulnerable young women

A psychic who convinced vulnerable young women to strip to improve their chances of contacting the dead has been warned he faces a jail term after being found guilty.

Karl Lang, 49, was convicted of causing women to engage in sexual activity without consent - in one case telling a victim to 'perform like a porn star'.

The rogue medium targeted two women in their 20s who sought him out in the belief he could contact dead relatives.

A jury at Newport Crown Court found him guilty of all 12 charges today, dismissing claims that he was an innocent spiritualist instructor.

Judge Patrick Curran QC agreed to grant Lang bail to ‘get his affairs in order’ until a sentencing hearing next month.

But he warned: ‘This involved a very serious breach of trust, and an immediate custodial sentence is, it seems to me, absolutely inevitable.’

He described Lang’s activity as ‘systematic conduct and a breach of trust involving two very vulnerable young women’.

He added that they were 'vulnerable in the sense that they were bereaved and sought the defendant’s consultation in communicating with those who died, and he took the most gross advantage of the situation'.

The jury agreed he was essentially a predator who targeted vulnerable women who turned to him with hope while at their lowest ebb.

He operated by offering his victims spiritual training as mediums, claiming it would boost their own psychic powers.

Once under his spell they were manipulated into stripping off and effectively acting out raunchy sex shows for his private gratification.

Both young women were also encouraged to take naked photographs of themselves and send them to his phone.

Lang, of Newport, South Wales, vehemently denied the claims, dismissing them during the trial as ‘wicked lies’.

Guilty: Lang, of Newport, South Wales, was found guilty at Newport Crown Court, pictured, of 12 charges causing women to engage in sexual activity without consent during séance sessions

He claimed he had been shocked when one young woman stripped off during a spiritualist session.

In interview he told police that 'letting go' was key to success in 
spiritualism and if that is what they wanted to do 'it was their 
problem'.

He told the jury he could see, hear and communicate with spirits from the other side, and had done so since the age of four.

He also claimed he had sought out a spiritualist church in Newport after a spirit attacked him at home in 1999.

From then on, he claimed, his powers increased and he performed to crowds of up to 1,000 at spiritualist churches across the UK.

Despite his insight into the world of 
the departed, the outcome of his trial today shows he failed to foresee 
where his behaviour would ultimately lead.

During his trial one of his victims, 
aged 26, told how she felt ‘embarrassed and ashamed’ that she was fooled
into taking part in nude séances.

Giving
evidence by live video link to avoid seeing 49-year-old Lang in the 
dock, she said she had been desperate to make contact with her 
grandfather.

Describing Lang’s method of improving 
her spiritual power, she said: ‘To get stronger, he told me I had to do 
things that mankind was afraid of.

‘This meant I had to get naked and 
perform a bit like a porn star. He said the more outrageous I performed,
the stronger I would become.’

The
woman, who first visited Lang when she was 19, carried on the sessions 
for more than three years, during which time she was instructed on 
reaching higher levels of ability, described in terms of ‘levels’ and 
‘colours’.

She said: ‘If you
didn’t dance to his tune, all hell would break loose. Bad things would 
happen. I’d lose my colours if I didn’t do what he wanted.’

The
woman continued: ‘Thinking about it now it makes me feel sick. I’m 
embarrassed and ashamed about what I had to do, but I was completely 
controlled. He mentally abused me.

‘I
met Karl at a very vulnerable stage in my life. He made me feel 
special. His eyes were warming and he made me feel safe and comfortable.
I saw Karl as my saviour.’

She
added: ‘After Karl was arrested, he rang me and begged me not to say 
anything. He said, “I’m big time in the s***, please don’t hang me”.’

The
other victim, now 27, said: ‘The first time I stripped off my clothes 
he said “Well done! You’ve gone up a level in the spiritual world”. He 
told me the more outrageous I behaved, the higher level I would get. It 
was like a reward system.’

On one occasion after obeying his 
sexually explicit instructions, she told the court: ‘Karl congratulated 
me by saying: “I didn’t think you had it in you – you really pleased the
spirit world”. I felt uncomfortable.’

She added: ‘He asked me to talk about 
my sexual fantasies during meditations. I would be naked with my eyes 
closed. He told me to imagine having sex. He said: “Be as outrageous as 
you want, don’t just have one man, have five”.’

The victim contacted Lang in 
an attempt to get in touch with her father, who died ten years ago. She 
later told police she felt ‘brainwashed, manipulated and groomed’.

The court heard that Lang had warned 
the woman not to tell anyone about his methods because he was the 
‘reincarnation of Jesus Christ’.
