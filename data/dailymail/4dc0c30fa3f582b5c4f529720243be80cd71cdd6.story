A woman has unearthed a treasure trove of pining love letters her father sent to her mother from the trenches during the Second World War.

Jim Allen, 23, was called to join the Irish Guards in April 1940, forcing him to leave behind his sweetheart, Ella Bradley.

Devastated that they hadn't married before he was deployed to Caterham, they wrote letters to each other every day.

Sweethearts: Jim Allen and Ella Bradley, who married during the war, wrote to each other every day

Finally unearthed by their daughter Virginia Aighton 70 years later, the moving notes have been compiled into a book, offering an awe-inspiring glimpse into wartime Britain and the life of a conscript.

Jim, from Accrington, Lancashire, 
served as an instructor before crossing the channel 12 days after D Day,
 where he faced fierce fighting.

During his early days of training, he wrote to Ella, declaring his love and describing the intensive daily routine at Caterham.

On April 9, 1940, he sent an emphatic letter about his elaborate uniform - 'boots that have to be polished till they look like glass!' - and intense daily routine.

At 6am they are up, dressed and tidying their quarters, he explained, before breakfast and the first parade at 8am.

'That is followed by Drill and when I say Drill I mean Drill! My feet are sore with stamping!' he exclaimed.

'Afterwards it's weapon training with rifle and bayonet. Then it's DRILL again till Dinnertime.

Treasure trove: It took Mrs Aighton 10 years to find the courage to look through the collection

'After dinner it's P.T. and more DRILL till tea, after which we polish our kit too 8 o'clock when we finish if we're lucky.

'To be honest darling to be here is like HELL!'

The sergeant major was discharged after being blown up by a mine while on reconnaissance near Maastricht.

He
 spent nine months in hospital, and wore a calliper for the rest of his 
life, although it didn’t stop him working at a printing firm.

Although he spoke often of his time in the war, Jim's daughter could not bear to go through his souvenirs and letters when he died in 2003.

Mrs Aighton, 65, had always planned to archive them - but it wasn't until she was listening to a war-themed radio piece this year that she finally felt ready to look at the suitcases of photos, telegrams, and notes.

She said: 'My father often entertained us round the dinner table with his stories about his wartime adventures.

'Dad also gave me a small brown suitcase containing letters and souvenirs from the Second World War.

'I was very busy at the time with work and family commitments, but we had an understanding that one day I would work on this project.

'Then one day I happened to hear a request on the radio asking if any listeners had authentic letters from the decades of the 20th century.

'I retrieved the suitcase from the cupboard and for the first time began to study properly the contents.'

Mrs Aighton, a retired teacher, added: 'When I started to read the letters, I found they were beautifully written and full of fascinating details about the times. Reading them was rather like peering through a window into the past.'

Wounded: Jim Allen, then a sergeant major, was blown up by a mine near Maastricht in November 1944 but survived with wounded to his hands and legs

Ella died from cancer in 1991, but Jim remained strong, staying in the house he shared with her from the end of the war until his death.

After tackling an intruder at home, he was taken to hospital with a broken hip, but succumbed to his injuries a fortnight later following an operation.

Two men, who got away with just £30 during the robbery, were jailed for manslaughter in connection with his death.

Ginny, who now lives in Wilpshire, Lancashire, is selling the book online on Kindle, and has several hard copies for sale too, which were printed by Jim’s former employer, John Nayler.
