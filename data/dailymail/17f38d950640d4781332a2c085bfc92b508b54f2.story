Blame: Judge Marson, pictured, said that although the boy carried out the rape the main instigator was the 12-year-old girl

A 12-year-old schoolgirl dared a boy to rape her friend and screamed 'you're not finished' when he tried to stop, a court has heard.

The bully punched the 11-year-old victim as she resisted the horrific sex attack by the 14-year-old male in West Yorkshire, who was worried he would look like a 'wimp' if he did not do it.

Leeds Crown Court heard the horrific case and the girl ringleader and the rapist were both sent to young offender institutions for 28 months.

In a shocking hearing yesterday it was revealed that the girl protagonist was laughing throughout the rape in October 2010.

The boy, now 15, admitted the attack but a judge said he was satisfied his younger co-accused, now 13, was the instigator of the heinous crime.

Judge Geoffrey Marson said: 'I accept although you were the older you were encouraged by a younger, stronger character.'

She was the one to suggest playing dares and had punched the girl when she resisted, he said, adding, despite their age he said there was no alternative but to impose 28 months detention.

Jason Pitter, prosecuting, said the girl had been domineering and bullied the victim, although they had a form of friendship.

On the day concerned they had ended up back at the girl defendant’s home in her bedroom and were later joined by the youth.

It was at that point the 12-year-old suggested a game of dares to the other two.

'It was a game that was to have serious consequences for the complainant,' he said.

The girl suggested the boy have sex with the 11-year-old who was punched in the face when she indicated reluctance to participate.

The boy later said he had not seen that blow but was aware the girl was injured because he saw a cut to her lip.

The girl pushed her on to the bed and after her lower clothing was removed the boy raped her but stopped when the victim told him to.

Mr Pitter said the girl 'was encouraging what was happening and heard to be laughing.'

When the boy stopped she told him: 'No you’re not finished' but he ignored her.

Their victim ran home and her mother noticed her face was red. She said the other girl had hit her but did not at that stage reveal her ordeal. It was only  later she felt she had to speak out.

Mark Foley, representing the boy, now 15, said: 'This was a very unusual and  extraordinary and exceptional set of circumstances.'

The boy was extremely immature and vulnerable to pressure from a stronger  character. He said later he felt he could not back down on the dare because it would make him 'seem like a wimp.'

Richard Reed, for the girl, now 13, said it was 'highly unusual offending particularly for a young female.'

She too was immature and because of her troubled background had difficulty at the time empathising with the victim’s situation.
