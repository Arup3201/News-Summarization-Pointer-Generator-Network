Nearly seven in ten people believe the military campaign in Afghanistan has not been ‘worthwhile’ for Britain.

As the last British troops left Camp Bastion yesterday, a poll suggested the majority of the public are sceptical of the claims of politicians and generals that the 13-year conflict has made both Afghanistan and the UK safer from terrorism.

The research, for BBC news, found 68 per cent thought it had not been worthwhile and 42 per cent believed the UK was actually ‘less safe’ now than when the war began in 2001.

Only 14 per cent of the 1,000 people polled thought the UK was safer as a result of the intervention, and 39 per cent thought there was ‘no real difference’ as Britain’s military involvement formally came to a close this week and Camp Bastion was handed over to Afghan control.

Less than a third were confident that Afghanistan could continue to ‘protect its citizens without the help of UK forces’ following years of training and investment in the Afghan national police and Army, while 64 per cent said they were not confident they were up to the challenge.

Labour shadow justice minister Dan Jarvis, a former officer in the Parachute regiment who has served in Afghanistan, yesterday called for a formal review of Britain’s role in Afghanistan, after the election, to look at whether the political and military objectives had been achieved, and examine the war on drugs.

He said the review would not seek to ‘apportion blame or scrutinise individual decisions, but to constructively draw conclusions about what can be learned from this deployment, to inform future foreign policy’.

‘Given the effort, the sacrifice and resource we’ve dedicated to this long campaign, I think that would be the right thing to do now,’ he added.

The commander of the Afghan army, Major General Sayed Malook, said: ‘I would really like to pay my condolences to the families and even to the governments, those who sent the soldiers to bring peace and prosperity to the Afghan people.

‘I wish them all the best, especially all those mothers who sent their sons right here to secure this nation and to provide safety and security for the Afghan people.’

Meanwhile, David Cameron paid tribute to the ‘incredible’ service personnel who have completed their mission in Afghanistan.

He said: ‘Yesterday, British forces concluded their combat mission in Afghanistan. I know the thoughts of the whole House will be with the friends and families of every one of the 453 British soldiers who lost their lives in this long campaign.

‘We will never forget their sacrifice for us.’

Labour leader Ed Miliband added: ‘All of our thanks are with those who have served our country and all of our thoughts are with the families of those who lost their lives.

‘But every one of our troops who served in Afghanistan can take pride in both their mission and what they achieved.’

The lives of the young Britons killed fighting the Taliban had been commemorated on memorial walls in Camp Bastion, but as the UK’s campaign in the country ended yesterday, it was confirmed they had been dismantled.

They will be part of a new memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. Tory MP Colonel Bob Stewart said it had been a ‘sensible decision’ because the memorial could have been desecrated. Speaking from Camp Bastion yesterday, Brigadier Rob Thomson, the UK’s most senior officer in Helmand, said: ‘We are going home and so we are taking it home.’

A memorial to murdered soldier Lee Rigby near the spot where he was hacked to death by jihadists will not include his name, it has emerged.

Campaigners have accused councillors of bowing to threats from extremists. More than 100,000 people had called for the tribute to the 25-year-old, who was murdered outside Woolwich Barracks, South London, in May 2013.

But the stone memorial in St George’s Chapel Gardens opposite the barracks, will not refer to him directly, but commemorate ‘all service men and women who have served or lived in Woolwich and who have given their lives in the service of their country’.

Lyn Rigby, the fusilier’s mother said: ‘I support the council’s plans and will feel able to visit the memorial in the Chapel.’
