Almost half of Twitter's 974 million active users have never sent a tweet, it has been claimed.

Research has revealed that 44% of accounts have never sent a tweet.

It is believed the 'dark' users only ever read other people's tweets, or simply abandoned their account after they signed up.

Research has revealed that 44% of accounts have never sent a tweet.

Twopcharts said that 30% of existing Twitter accounts have sent 1-10 tweets, and only 13% of the accounts have written at least 100 tweets.

It also found 47% of users have never uploaded a profile pictures.

However, Twopcharts is unable to track how often people logged into their accounts.

Last month, the firm estimated there have been 1.5 billion signups in Twitter’s eight-year history, but 500 million were deactivated or deleted as a result of spam and other transgressions.

Twitter said it has 241 million monthly active users the last three months of 2013.

The firm also tracked how people access Twitter, and found the iPhone app the most popular

Twitter defines a monthly active user as an account that logs in at least once a month.

By Twitter’s standards, a person does not have to tweet to be considered a monthly active user.

A Twitter spokesman declined to comment, saying the company does not comment on third-party data.

Earlier this week the company said it was introducing a redesign of profile pages that includes bigger photos, more user controls and a distinct resemblance to Facebook.

'Moment by moment, your Twitter profile shows the world who you are,' the company wrote in a blog post.

As part of its latest redesign, Twitter users can now pin tweets to the top of their profile, add larger profile pictures, and customise their header images. Tweets that have received the most retweets or interactions now appear larger on a person's profile. Michelle Obama's Twitter account pictured features the new look

'Starting today, it will be even easier (and, we think, more fun) to express yourself through a new and improved Web profile.'

As part of changes coming in the next few weeks, users who access Twitter via the Web will notice larger photos on their profile pages.

Besides profile photos on the left corner of the page, the redesign includes a large banner photo that resembles the big rectangular cover photos on Facebook pages.

Users will be able to "pin" one of their tweets to the top of the page to give others an idea of the topics they like to tweet about. In addition, tweets that receive the most interest from other users will appear slightly larger.

Earlier this year, Twitter rolled out the new design to select users and it was criticised for closely resembling how Facebook profiles look.

The
 most noticeable change was the size of the cover photo. Twitter added 
the feature initially during a redesign in September 2012, five months 
after Facebook included it as part of its Timeline rejig.

Twitter
 cover photos now appear full-width along the top of the screen, and the
 profile picture that used to sit in the centre of this cover image was 
moved to the left-hand side.

In
 line with this change, a user's bio that traditionally appeared inside 
the cover photo has also been moved to below the profile picture.

Many users recently spotted that Twitter was experimenting with doing away with the Retweet button. A number of members reported the option had been replaced with a Facebook-style 'Share with followers' button, while the Quote Tweet button had been replaced with 'First add comment', pictured

Thumbnail pictures of followers have been moved up and Trends have been moved down.

In March, Twitter posted a blog announcing a new range of photo options. Users can now add up to four pictures in each tweet, where they could only previously add one.

The firm also added the ability to tag up to ten friends in a photo, without using up any of the tweets 140 characters.

Many users also spotted last month that Twitter was experimenting with doing away with the Retweet button.

A
 number of members reported the option had been replaced with a 
Facebook-style ‘Share’ button, while the Quote Tweet button had been 
replaced with ‘First add comment.’
