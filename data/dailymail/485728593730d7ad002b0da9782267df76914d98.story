An internal investigation at  American Apparel Inc has found that its 
CEO Dov Charney  violated company policies, ranging from misusing 
company funds  to failing to stop the discrediting of at least one 
former  employee who had accused him of sexual harassment, a person  
close to the matter said.

Employee Irene Morales claimed in an unsuccessful lawsuit that Charney held her captive in her apartment for several hours and forced to carry out sexual acts.

The case was thrown out in 2012 but Morales was subject to an online campaign to discredit her and Charney is now facing claims he failed to stop it.

The company's board 
ousted the 45-year-old Charney as  chairman on Wednesday, citing 
unspecified allegations of  misconduct. It suspended him as president 
and chief executive  officer, and plans to fire him for cause, following
 a 30-day  period stipulated in his contract.

The
 company's independent directors hired law firm Jones Day  in mid-March 
to lead the investigation, said the person and a  separate source 
familiar with the matter.Â

Irene Morales, 21, said that Charney allegedly made her his sex slave and new information states Charney may have allowed an employee to impersonate her online

It is unclear what  events prompted the board 
to initiate the investigation, which  is ongoing.

The
 probe revealed that Charney, who founded the hipster  clothing brand, 
was using company funds to book flights for his  parents, the person 
said.

He also sometimes provided corporate  apartments to friends and 
stayed in them himself when he wasn't  on company business, according to
 this person.

The investigation's findings also 
included that Charney had  known about but failed to stop a blog created
 by an American  Apparel employee that displayed naked photographs of 
former  saleswoman, Irene Morales, who had sued him, the person said.

A
 person familiar with Charney's thinking said that any use  of 
photographs of the former employee by American Apparel was  only done to
 counter her damaging allegations and the strategy  was approved by 
other company officials.

This person said that 
Charney believed any use of apartments  was not material and was normal 
business practice.

In terms of  the travel charges, this person said 
Charney's father is on  American Apparel's payroll and that his mother, 
although not an  employee, is a retail and design contributor to the 
company.

Charney's employment
 contract entitled him to "vacation  benefits and reimbursement of 
reasonable and necessary business  expenses," according to a company 
filing in April.

His father,  Morris Charney, received $238,000 in 
architectural consulting  and director fees from the company in 2013, 
the filing showed.

A spokesman for American 
Apparel declined to comment. A  representative for Jones Day was not 
immediately available for  comment.

The company, 
which only has a market value of $120 million,  has been struggling with
 weak sales and heavy debt.

While the  industry lauded Charney for his 
creativity, the company has been  under fire for lax financial controls 
and concerns about the  strength of its management team.

In
 recent years,  Charney has fought off a series of sexual  harassment 
lawsuits.

In one of the most high-profile cases,  Morales claimed she 
was held as a teenage sex slave, forced to  perform sexual acts during 
an eight-month period, including oral  sex in Charney's Manhattan 
apartment just after she turned 18.

A lawyer for 
American Apparel said in 2011 that it was  Morales who had stalked 
Charney and was trying to "shake down"  the company.

In
 2012, a New York judge ordered her $250 million claim to  be 
arbitrated. The status of the arbitration proceedings could  not be 
immediately determined.

American Apparel is in 
talks to hire an investment bank,  expected to be boutique Peter J. 
Solomon, one of the people  close to the matter said.

The bank, which 
could not be  immediately reached for comment, will provide capital if 
the  company's lenders declare it in default on some of its debt, the  
person said.
