Born with only half a heart, this brave, determined little eight-year-old is living life to the full.

Abbie Bayes was born with the rare condition which means the right side of her heart is underdeveloped and unable to pump enough blood around her body.

The serious congenital heart defect, hypoplastic right heart syndrome, affects some 600 babies every year and many of those die within just days of being born.

Living life to the full: Abbie Bayes, 8, was born with the rare condition which means the right side of her heart is underdeveloped and unable to pump enough blood around her body

Abbie underwent surgery at 13 weeks old and aged four, and will need a full heart transplant as she continues to grow.

Now aged eight, Abbie is a determined little girl living on ‘borrowed time’, her mother Tracy Pears, 43, of Durham said.

She said: ‘We feel like we're on borrowed time with Abbie, so we make sure that every day counts.

‘We make the most of our time and we spoil Abbie rotten. Whatever she wants to do, if we can make it happen, we will do it.

‘We always carry a camera with us as we want to get memories of Abbie all the time and we're always doing something.’

Abbie’s serious heart defect, hypoplastic right heart syndrome, was not discovered until she was six-weeks-old.

Parents Ms Pears and Gary Bayes, 46, first learned something was wrong when a routine check-up detected their daughter had a heart murmur.

Subsequent tests and examinations revealed that she had the condition and would need intensive treatment at the region's children's heart unit to survive.

It came as a shock to the family as the pregnancy had gone smoothly and Abbie was born a healthy baby at the University Hospital of North Durham, weighing 7lb 10oz.

Ms Bayes said: ‘When we were first told that Abbie had heart failure I immediately thought that she was not going to make it.

‘It came as a shock as she looked like any other child her age and was doing everything that you would expect a baby to do.’

Mr Bayes has a heart defect and so Ms Pears had undergone an extra pregnancy scan to see if her daughter also had a problem with the organ.

Shock diagnosis: Born a healthy baby, it came as a shock when Abbie was diagnosed with the condition which kills many babies within days of being born, but she has proved to be a determined little girl, undergoing surgery again when she was four (pictured)

However, all scans came back clear and it was thought that Abbie was growing and developing as expected.

Abbie's serious complex congenital condition puts added pressure on the working side of the heart as it compensates for the damaged side.

This added pressure will eventually lead to organ failure, when she will need a heart transplant.

Abbie finds it difficult to walk up stairs as she easily gets out of breath and her lips and fingernails often 

turn blue due to the lower oxygen levels in her blood.

'Centre of attention': Abbie 'has a mind of her own' says Ms Pears (pictured together with brothers Charlie, left, 10, and Harry, five)

It is anticipated that Abbie will need a heart transplant in the future and will then spend a lifetime on anti-rejection medication.

Abbie's siblings Siobhan, 25, Craig, 23, Charlie, 10, and Harry, five, do not have any heart problems.

But despite all she has gone through, Abbie is a determined girl.

Ms Pears said: ‘Abbie has a mind of her own and loves being the centre of attention. She is a real girly girl. She is very confident.

‘I can't put into words how great the team is at the Freeman's children's heart unit as they do an outstanding job.

‘They give you so much confidence that your child is going to get the best care possible and that everything will be done to help.’
