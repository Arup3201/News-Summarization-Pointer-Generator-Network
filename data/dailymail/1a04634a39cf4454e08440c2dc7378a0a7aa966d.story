Like many identical twins, Jo and Kerry Burton have done everything in sync – from ballet lessons to beating chickenpox.

So when Jo decided to have cosmetic surgery on her nose 17 years ago, Kerry followed suit.

And since then, the 38-year-olds have spent £70,000 on a host of cosmetic surgeries – all carried out at the same time by the same doctors – to ensure they cannot be told apart.

They have had two breast enlargements, identical nose jobs, eye-lifts, tattooed eyeliner, facials, spray tans, manicures and pedicures.

Twice a year they even have Botox together – at the same time, naturally, so they age at the same rate.

Their most recent operation was in January when they underwent another breast enlargement, going from a DD cup to an E on the same day. Their identical surgeries began when the women, who live within five minutes of one another in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, were just 21.

Beautician Kerry, who is the eldest by 15 minutes and mother to Drew, six, and Sienna, three, recalled: ‘Jo said she’d like a curve in her nose. I agreed that our noses were very straight and it seemed natural to go under the knife together.’

And strangely enough, the operations, which cost £2,500 each, both went wrong. ‘The tip of Jo’s nose turned one way and mine went the other,’ said Kerry.

So a year later they had joint corrective surgery. However the experience didn’t put them off. In 2004, they both got a breast augmentation costing £4,500 each, to go from a 34B to a 34DD.

Jo, who lives with partner Andy Ince, 46, and is a full-time mother to Jade, 12, and Evie-May, ten months, said: ‘The surgeon even scribbled our initials on our stomachs so he didn’t get muddled up.’

By the age of 26, the twins were having regular Botox and facials. ‘Always at the same time,’ says Jo, ‘so we age the same way.’

In 2009, at a cost of £300 each, they had eyeliner tattooed on their eyelids, following eye-lifts totalling £6,000.

Once again it was Jo’s idea. She said: ‘I noticed a few crow’s feet appearing around my eyes and thought about an eye lift. Kerry agreed and we were delighted with the result.’

After discovering their implants were faulty PIP ones, they replaced them in January this year and went up to an E cup. The operations cost £3,000 each.

Kerry: 'We did ballet together and even beat chickenpox together. As toddlers we spoke in our own language that only we could understand'

They said their close bond came as no surprise to their parents Valerie and Colin – who had no idea they were expecting two babies until four weeks before they were born. Kerry weighed 6lb 13oz and Jo was 7lb 2oz.

Kerry said: ‘Mum did her very best to ensure she could quickly tell us apart. Jo was always dressed in blue and I was in pink. But even as children we wanted to do everything together.

‘We did ballet together and even beat chickenpox together.

‘As toddlers we spoke in our own language that only we could understand. Then at school we’d often swap places.

‘I didn’t like cookery and, as a result, I was hardly ever there.’

They said that as they grow older, they would consider a facelift. However, Jo added: ‘It would have to be joint surgery.

‘We’d never have anything done without the other.’
