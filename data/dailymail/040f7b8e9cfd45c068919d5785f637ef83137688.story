Franck Ribery has revealed that he rejected a cortisone injection from French medical staff before the World Cup because he knew it was 'not good' for his long-term fitness.

The 31-year-old winger was forced to withdraw from France's 23-man squad after failing to recover from a back injury in time to play in Brazil.

His absence from the squad has caused a major selection headache for coach Didier Deschamps whose side had been built around Ribery.

And Ribery has revealed that French medical staff suggested a cortisone injection - which would provide powerful anti-inflammatory medication to his back - to his back could have allowed him to play a part in the tournament but he refused one.

Speaking to German news agency SID, the 80-cap international said: 'I'm not afraid of injections, but I didn't want to have a cortisone injection from the French doctor.

'I know it's not good (for my long-term health).'

The Bayern Munich star's comments were made in response to French national team doctor Kevin Le Gall's comments claiming that Ribery had not been offered any injections because he was afraid of needles.

Le Gall said: 'Franck belongs to a club (Bayern) whose method of treatment for all ailments, whatever they might be, is based on injections.'

Ribery, who has netted 16 times for France, leaves Les Bleus with only one player in their squad - Karim Benzema - who has scored more than 10 international goals.
