The Syrian refugee crisis escalates as some 100,000 refugee fled Syria, the highest monthly total since the hostilities started 17 months ago, U.N. figures reveal.

The tide in people fleeing the civil war, a figure that includes both refugees who are registered and those awaiting registration with the Geneva-based U.N. refugee agency, highlights the growing violence between the regime of Syria's president, Bashar Assad, and the armed anti-government groups. 

The refugee situation worsened as activists say some 5,000 people were killed in August, the bloodiest month so far in the 17-month-old uprising and more than three times the monthly average.

Bloodiest month: August has seen the largest amount of Syrian refugees flee the country as activists claim it to also be the bloodiest as violence continues such as this car bomb which ripped through Jaramana, a suburb of Damascus yesterday

The U.N. children's agency says 1,600 were killed last week alone, also the highest figure for the entire revolt. 

The August refugee total represents more than 40 per cent of the 234,368 Syrian refugees who, as of the last count on September 2, had fled for surrounding countries since the uprising began 17 months ago.

U.N. refugee agency spokesman Melissa Fleming said at the U.N.’s European headquarters in Geneva: ‘If you do the math, it's quite an astonishing number and it points to a significant escalation in refugee movement and people seeking asylum, and probably points to a very precarious and violent situation inside the country.’

Precarious: The significant refugee movement points to a 'very precarious and violent situation inside the country,' U.N. spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said as this Free Syria Army fighter received treatment in Aleppo

The refugee agency and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent are continuing to expand their operations to support displaced Syrians and are appealing to all nations to take in Syrians who need asylum. 

There are now more than 80,000 Syrian refugees in Turkey, where the borders remain open, but there is a backlog of some 8,000 Syrians waiting to be processed at the border, Ms Fleming said.

Jordan has more than 77,000 Syrian refugees, Lebanon has more than 59,000 and Iraq nearly 18,700 according to the agency.

Food aid: This building was damaged yesterday by a car bomb as the U.N. announced plans to increase operations providing food urgently needed by 1.5million people in areas where there has been fighting and people have been left homeless

The U.N.'s World Food Program 
spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs said that her agency is scaling up operations
 to provide food urgently needed by 1.5 million people this month, 
mainly in areas where there has been fighting and people made at least 
temporarily homeless.

The fighting has spread to the country's two largest cities, the capital Damascus and the commercial hub of Aleppo, where more than 264,000 people are taking shelter in public buildings in the Aleppo region. About 200,000 are in rural areas and more than 64,000 are in the city proper, Ms Byrs said.

The two major activist groups, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Local Coordination Committees, have raised their total death toll to between 23,000 and 26,000. 

More assistance: Peter Maurer, left, the new president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, has urged the respect of international humanitarian law and the need to boost assistance on the ground as he met volunteers in Damascus today

Welcomed aid: President Bashar Assad is said to have welcomed humanitarian operations as long as it remains 'impartial and independent'

The new president of the International 
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), veteran Swiss diplomat Peter Maurer, 
met in Damascus with Assad on Tuesday.

Maurer urged respect for international 
humanitarian law and the need to boost assistance on the ground in 
Syria, ICRC spokesman Hisham Hassan said in a statement.

State television said Assad told Maurer that he supports the work of the ICRC in Syria so long as it remains ‘impartial and independent’.

State television said: ‘President Assad assured the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross that he welcomed the humanitarian operations carried out by the committee on the ground in Syria, as long as it remains impartial and independent.’

Syria's state-run SANA news agency reported that Assad told the Red Cross it was welcome to operate on the ground in Syria ‘as long as it works in a neutral and independent way’. 

A fifth meeting of the U.N.-sponsored Syrian Humanitarian Forum, made up of hundreds of nations, regional groups, U.N. agencies and non-governmental organizations, is also planned for Friday in Geneva. 

At the last meeting in mid-July the operations director for the U.N.'s humanitarian office said its appeal for $189 million to help people inside Syria was only 20 per cent funded.
