Mexico is about to see its first openly gay mayor after a singer who owns a gay bar was elected in a rural area of the country.

The election of Benjamin Medrano has been hailed as a significant victory for gay rights in Mexico, where homosexuals often feel oppressed due to the conservative Catholic culture.

His victory in the city of Fresnillo came despite a smear campaign against him in which his political rivals apparently criticised him to voters 'as if being gay were a crime'.

The city is located in Zacatecas state in central Mexico, a largely rural region famous for a macho culture where men wear cowboy hats and boots, and a state plagued by shootouts between drug gangs.

Champion: Benjamin Medrano has become Mexico's first openly gay mayor after being elected in Fresnillo

Mr Medrano, 47, described his constituency as 'very machisto', adding that the area is 'full of tough country people, who don't necessarily have much information on what's happening elsewhere, and have even less of an automatic sympathy with their gay mayor.'

However, despite his openness about his sexuality, the new mayor insisted: 'It's not like I'm going to paint city hall pink.'

Gay people in Mexico rarely face official persecution, as homosexuality has been legal in the country since the 19th century, and there are a number of laws banning anti-gay discrimination.

However, 95 per cent of Mexican gays feel oppressed by others, according to a recent survey, as the strong Catholic influence on society means many people regard homosexuality as immoral.

While a number of Mexican politicians have been rumoured to be gay, none has ever come out, making Mr Medrano the most senior openly gay official ever to have been elected.

He won his victory by campaigning over public safety, aiming to clamp down on the gang turf war in Fresnillo which has led to bodies being found hacked to bits, decapitated or with their throats slashed.

Tough: The area where Mr Medrano will hold office is remote and plagued with violence

The city of 230,000 is at the centre of fierce fighting between the Zetas and the Gulf Cartel because it sits on some of northern Mexico's main trafficking routes.

Mr Medrano insisted he is 'not at risk' because he has no ties to any of the cartels, but admitted: 'Of course, I have the same fear that anybody who lives in Fresnillo has.'

He said that he had become accepted in the rough region thanks to his fame as a singer - one area where homosexuality is widely accepted - and his two decades running a gay bar.

The new mayor has been seen at gay rights marches in the past, and said he is 'very proud to be the first openly gay mayor in this country' - adding that other gay politicans should be unafraid to be open about their sexuality.

Mr Medrano is a Roman Catholic, and is reluctant to contradict the teaching of the church.

'I wish the church had a different view, but I cannot go against doctrine,' he said. 'I respect my church, and I don't want to dig any deeper beyond what's permitted and what is appropriate.'

'I'm not in favour of gay marriage, I don't share that view, because we are still a very small town - in short, we're not prepared, in my view. Not yet, anyway, because we have strong roots in our religion, and in our customs.'

Gay rights campaigner Alejandro Brito, director of Letra S, said that Mr Medrano's election was likely to be a breakthrough for the movement in Mexico, adding that the only gay politicians to hold office previously were chosen by political parties rather than directly by voters.

'This shows that our human rights system is providing some protection,' he said. 'Because, even though there is no public majority in favor of electing gay politicians, he knows that the legal framework will protect him.

'It is now more risky for a political rival to be openly homophobic than it is to be a homosexual candidate.'
