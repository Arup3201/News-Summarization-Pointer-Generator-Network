Unhappy: Sir Jonathan Miller says he is 'ashamed' to be helping his grandchildren through private education

Socialist Sir Jonathan Miller has admitted being 'ashamed' that he is supporting his grandchildren through private school.

In a war of words with his own son William, the renowned theatre director said the decision was made to ensure they got a good education.

Sir Jonathan added he was furious about 'belonging to a society which makes such as sharp distinction' between Britain's rich and poor.

There was 'something deeply malignant about a structure which makes it necessary to make these invidious choices,' he said.

He sent his own children to state schools but his son William called the decision a 'cavalier social experiment'.

William has sent his own children into private education, which Sir Jonathan says he is contributing towards.

'I do give them a little bit just to ensure there is some sort of 
security, but I feel rather ashamed of it and I feel ashamed of 
belonging to a society which makes such a sharp distinction between the 
prosperous and the assured, whose future is guaranteed, and those who 
are not,' Sir Jonathan told the Sunday Times this week. 

'It all ought to be state education. It’s part and parcel of 
this profound and malignant separation of the prosperous from the poor.

'People who have huge amounts of can afford to wrap their children in 
all sorts of protective educational devices which guarantee that they 
will become like their parents.'

William Miller claims that he and his
 two siblings would have fared better had they been sent to public 
schools and Oxbridge, like their parents, but instead they were sent to 
state schools to appease the couple's socialist principals.

Wrong: Son of Sir Jonathan Miller, William, said his parents put him through state school as some sort of 'social experiment'

'It
 turned out to be a cavalier social experiment that saw all three of his
 children fail to gain a single qualification. He is right to feel 
guilty: it was a wholly avoidable disaster,' he wrote in 2009.

Miller grew up near London's Regent's Park where his parents' neighbours were intellectuals including Alan Bennett, George Melly, Shirley Conran and AJ Ayer. He started school at Primrose Hill state primary in 1969 and went on to Pimlico comprehensive in 1975.

He says: 'If you were to ask me what I remember about learning, I think I could just about recall that the Romans long baths and hated the Scots.'

But Sir Jonathan himself went to the prestigious St Paul's School in London and then on to Cambridge University.

'One wants to have freedom of choice – it is a very important thing – but there is something deeply malignant about a structure which makes it necessary to make these invidious choices to guarantee your children are enveloped in protected devices,' he said.
