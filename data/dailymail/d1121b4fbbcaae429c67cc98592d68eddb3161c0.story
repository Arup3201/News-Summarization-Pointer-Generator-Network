The Americans have a score to settle after surrendering the Ryder Cup back in 2012 after a sensational comeback from the Europeans.

Englishman Ian Poulter gives Sportsmail the lowdown on the opposition as he aims to retain the trophy on home soil.

(Top row L-R) Phil Mickelson, Keegan Bradley, vice captain Andy North, Bubba Watson, Matt Kuchar, vice captain Steve Stricker, (middle row L-R) Rickie Fowler, Jordan Spieth, Patrick Reed, Hunter Mahan, vice captain Raymond Floyd, (front row L-R) Webb Simpson, Zach Johnson, Tom Watson, Jimmy Walker and Jim Furyk of the US Ryder Cup team pose

Bubba Watson

Ryder Cup record (W-L-H): 3-5-0

So unorthodox, but you have to say it’s impressive the way he gets it around. Don’t think he will be getting the crowd to applaud on the first tee this week, will he? It was great last time, though.

Jimmy Walker

Ryder Cup record: Debut.

Don’t know a lot about him, to be honest. Played with him recently and he seems quiet and shy. Certainly hits it a long way. One of those swings where you wouldn’t think he’d be long, but he is. Plenty of short game, too.

Zach Johnson

Ryder Cup record (W-L-H): 6-4-1

I admire him a lot. Done it his way since day one. Shut at the top of his backswing and hits it with a big draw but look how much he’s won. And he’s like G-Mac in the Ryder Cup — never knows when he’s beaten. 

Phil Mickelson

Ryder Cup record (W-L-H): 14-18-6

The most accomplished member of this American team. I just love the fact he’s only ever had one caddie and what discussions they have! Sometimes it’s like they’re auditioning for the United Nations.

Jordan Spieth

Ryder Cup record: Debut.

Reminds me a lot of the young Sergio Garcia in the way he has burst on the scene and looks so at home out there already. I think it’s brilliant the way he keeps churning out results. I don’t think he was ever off a leaderboard for his first 15 months on tour.

Rickie Fowler

Ryder Cup record (W-L-H): 0-1-2

Can be risky changing your swing but Butch Harmon has turned it around and Rickie was just amazing in the majors, with the lowest average score of anyone. A gutsy guy and one to watch this week, that’s for sure.

Matt Kuchar

Ryder Cup record (W-L-H): 3-2-2

The 20-teeth plodder! Sorry Kooch, I mean it in the nicest sense. Another who does it his way and another who makes it work. Hardly ever misses a fairway and while his putting stroke is pretty unique, it gets the job done.

Jim Furyk

Ryder Cup record (W-L-H): 9-17-4

It’s not going to be easy for him after last time, is it? There must be some scar tissue in there, but you have to say his play over the last six months has been fantastic. Relies on his wedge play and there’s plenty to rely on.

Patrick Reed 

Ryder Cup record: Debut.

I’ve barely spoken to him but he’s won three times so he’s obviously got a very decent game. Would he hold it against me if I said that claiming to be a world top five player is probably stretching it, though?

Keegan Bradley

Ryder Cup record (W-L-H): 3-1-0

You won’t be surprised to learn I love the fire he brings to the Ryder Cup. Okay, the caddie went over the top last time, swirling the flag above his head, but Keegan gets it and that’s great to see.

Webb Simpson

Ryder Cup record (W-L-H): 2-2-0

Gotta be honest — I can’t remember anything he’s done this season. But he’s steady, he’s a major winner and putting is his strong suit, which is never a bad thing at a Ryder Cup.

Hunter Mahan

Ryder Cup record (W-L-H): 3-2-3

Will be itching to make amends after Celtic Manor. An understandable wildcard pick, given he won a tournament this month. Makes lots of birdies, so watch for him in the fourballs.
