The chant Cambridge United fans directed at £60m Angel di Maria on Friday night was an indicator of how much football can change in a short period of time.

'What a waste of money,' heckled the supporters, with the former Real Madrid star flattering to deceive as Manchester United failed to break down their League Two counterparts in the FA Cup.

After a blistering start to life in the Premier League, the club record fee splashed out on Di Maria was heralded as a snip. But while the Argentine obviously has the quality, things are just not clicking under Louis van Gaal at present.

Comparisons can of course be drawn to Mesut Ozil who also flew out of the blocks before suffering with injuries and form, while La Liga is obviously an entirely different prospect to the Premier League. It is easier to pinpoint Di Maria's dip in form, though. 

United couldn't have pulled off a more suitable signature if they had tried when they lured the 26-year-old to England.

The winger was in the form of his life, man of the match in the Champions League final last season, starring at the World Cup with Argentina. This was the man to reinvigorate the Red Devils, that flying No 7 fans crave in Manchester.

A goal on his Old Trafford bow against QPR, as well as several fancy flicks and tricks, suggested United had found their new hero. Sportsmail's Chris Wheeler even claimed that there may not have been a better home debut since Wayne Rooney's hat-trick in 2004. He made 76 passes in that game, compared to just 21 against Southampton in his most recent home outing.

A superb chip at Leicester followed, while he also netted against Everton. United would have been bereft of ideas during their 2-2 draw at West Brom in October were it not for Di Maria impressing in a diamond formation, or even in the much maligned 3-5-2.

But Van Gaal was obviously uneasy with how his team were playing, and most importantly, defending. United had conceded 12 league goals in eight games after the draw at the Hawthorns, they've conceded nine in 14 since.

'That is what the club has been built on for the last 10 to 15 years – being able to get from box to box quickly, being able to spring on teams, having people that can dribble and are quick in the final third,' Sky Sports pundit and Manchester United legend Gary Neville said in August.

'This signing fits the bill in terms of what United are and the philosophy.'

Di Maria's swashbucking runs forward have since disappeared. That pace and drive with the ball, with which he gathers confidence to show off his ability, seems to have been reined back.

With the attacking talent Van Gaal brought in last summer adding to the likes of Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Juan Mata already at the club, he was always going to have a conundrum. But despite Di Maria's form out wide and starting moves further back, coupled with Radamel Falcao's eagerness to play, his next position to test out was up front.

The counter attacking display at Arsenal was perfect for his talents as an out and out striker. His goal may have convinced his boss that this was a method to test in the future.

Of course, Di Maria's versatility should not be disregarded. He was loved by Carlo Ancelotti in Madrid for his ability to operate out wide to compliment Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale in a 4-4-2, or testing the opposition centrally with his box-to-box runs in a 4-3-3.

But his move from a withdrawn midfield role, to a brief spell at wing back to up top this season has been bizarre from Van Gaal, despite fans catching a glimpse of his talents when given the space to run.

Injuries disrupted Di Maria in December, while Van Gaal's new-look cautious United kept grinding out wins. His return to the starting line up against Southampton saw him struggle more than ever in the role of a striker.

Fans chanted '4-4-2' during United's win against QPR last weekend, obviously eager to see Di Maria on the ball on the wing rather than wasting his talents away from the action.

The Dutch boss has since revealed that the formation leaves him 'twitching his ass', though that didn't refrain him from opting for the diamond at Cambridge, much to the delight of supporters.

However, the Di Maria we saw at Abbey Stadium was not the player every one knows he can be. This was a player bereft of confidence (even Phil Jones was taking the corners), eager to make an impact on the game but his decision making was way off. 

Van Gaal was unhappy with his side's performance against League Two minnows Cambridge in a 0-0 draw

Di Maria had five shots against Cambridge, one of which ballooned out of the stadium

One of his five shots in particular was the subject of ridicule from the noisy home faithful, an effort from 30 yards which ballooned over the bar, and out of the stadium. 

Perhaps Van Gaal should have taken Di Maria out of the firing line in a game which obviously wasn't going to suit his ability. Perhaps a strong start masked over the fact that every player takes time to acclimatise in England.

But the speed in which the super-talented midfielder has gone from star of world football to the butt of minnows' jokes will be worrying for United fans and Van Gaal.
