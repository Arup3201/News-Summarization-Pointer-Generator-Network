Former Newcastle defender Davide Santon has been called up to the Italy squad for Tuesday's friendly against England.

Santon, who made his loan move from Newcastle to Inter Milan permanent last month, has been drafted into Antonio Conte's squad following injuries to Matteo Darmian and Manuel Pasqual.

AC Milan defender Ignazio Abate has also been called up.

Italy warmed up for England's visit with a 2-2 draw in their Euro 2016 qualifier away to Bulgaria on Saturday.

Goalkeeper and captain Gianluigi Buffon sat out the match in Sofia with flu and he is a doubt for the international against Roy Hodgson's men at the Juventus Stadium.

Theo Walcott has been picked out by Giorgio Chiellini as the England player who can be most dangerous

Meanwhile, Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini is more concerned about the presence of Theo Walcott than the goal threat posed by Wayne Rooney and Harry Kane in Turin.

'I am always a fan of Walcott, a quick sprinter and terrifying for defenders,' Chiellini said. 'England notice his absence. For the world of football, it is positive that Walcott recuperates totally to his top level.'

Italy beat England 2-1 in last summer's World Cup and also eliminated the Three Lions from Euro 2008 in a quarter-final penalty shoot-out.
