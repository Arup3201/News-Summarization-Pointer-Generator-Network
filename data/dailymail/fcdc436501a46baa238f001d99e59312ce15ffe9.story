Nigel Pearson has been contacted by the Football Association and asked for his observations following his verbal altercation with a fan that was caught on camera.

Film footage postage on social media appeared to show the Leicester manager responding to a foul-mouthed taunt from a supporter during the defeat by Liverpool with the words: 'F*** off and die.'

The move from the FA comes after video of the exchange emerged online.

A decision will be made on whether Pearson should face a misconduct charge once his written reply is received. He has until 6pm on Wednesday to get back to the governing body.

Pearson has refused to apologise to the fan in question when given opportunity, but has express regret if others were offended.

'I have had run-ins with fans in the past and in the heat of the moment these things happen,' he said on Friday. 'It's best if we don't speak about what happened on either side, I'm not going to repeat what happened here.

'I am very keen to protect my players and myself and I'm more than happy to stick up for myself in that situation.

'If people were offended by what happened that is regrettable but there's no need for me to apologise to someone of that ilk.'

Leicester announced last Wednesday they would look into the incident as a club but he has received board support over the matter and is unlikely to face any internal action. Any announcement is set to be made after FA proceedings have run their course.

Leicester are on a 10-game winless streak and lost 2-1 at Aston Villa on Sunday to sit bottom of the Premier League.
