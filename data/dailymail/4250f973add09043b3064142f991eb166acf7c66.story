Masked gunmen on a motorbike opened fire on a Coptic wedding in Cairo killing three people, including an eight-year-old girl.

The attack took place at the Virgin Mary Coptic Christian church in the Waraa neighborhood of the Egyptian capital yesterday evening. A man and child were reportedly killed at the scene, the woman died on the way to hospital.

A health ministry official confirmed three people had been killed and that 12 people had been wounded in the first such assault targeting Christians in Cairo since the military coup that ousted Islamist president.

First fatal church attack: Egyptians gather around blood stains at the entrance of the Virgin Mary Coptic Christian church in Cairo after gunmen on a motorbike shot dead three people

Calls for justice: Egypt's interim prime minister has condemned the attack, pledged the perpetrators will be brought to justice and that their actions will not divide Muslims and Christians

'We heard a very loud sound as if something was collapsing,' one eyewitness, quoted by the BBC, said.

'I
found a woman seated in a chair with lots of bullet wounds, covered in 
blood. Many other people had fallen around her, including a child,' he 
added.

Egypt's interim prime minister has 
condemned the attack and pledged police would do everything possible to 
bring the perpetrators to justice.

Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi said in a statement today that the attack on Sunday night was a 'callous and criminal act'.

He says such attacks will 'not succeed in sowing divisions between the nation's Muslims and Christians'.

Since a popularly-backed military coup ousted the country's Islamist president in July, there have been stepped-up attacks against Egypt's Coptic Christians and their churches.

Tensions between the two groups 
escalated before the country's revolution in January 2011. But many 
local people blamed such attacks on the government, claiming they were 
to distract people from the country's bigger economic and social 
problems.

Clashes continued yesterday between police and hundreds of supporters of the country's 
ousted Islamist president. Riot police besieged the protestors inside a prestigious Muslim 
institution after stone-hurling protesters cut off a main road.

Sunday's clashes marked the second day of unrest at Al-Azhar University, Sunni Islam's most prominent center of learning. Many supporters of ousted President Mohammed Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood are students at Al-Azhar, a stronghold of the group. The campus is also near where Islamists had set up a sprawling protest camp that security forces raided in August, leaving hundreds dead and sparking days of unrest.

The students' protest started with a march inside campus, where protesters hurled stones at the administrator's offices, smashing windows and breaking doors, said Ibrahim el-Houdhoud, deputy head of the university. He told satellite news channel Al-Jazeera Mubashir Misr that he warned protesters against leaving campus and clashing with security forces.

The protesters however ignored the 
advice, marching out of the main gates to hold 'prayers for the dead' - 
honoring students killed in earlier clashes between security forces and 
protesters in July.

The 
protests come amid heated debate over a new law that would place tougher
restrictions on demonstrators, which includes imposing heavy fines and 
possible jail time on violators.

Morsi was overthrown by the military July 3 after millions took to the streets to demand he step down. Since then, Cairo has seen non-stop demonstrations by his supporters demanding his return. A military-backed crackdown has left hundreds dead and seen thousands arrested.

Ousting Morsi escalated militant attacks in Egypt, especially in the volatile Sinai peninsula. Egypt's interior minister escaped an assassination attempt when a car bomb targeted his convoy near his residence in Cairo last month.

Egypt's official news agency MENA also reported that two members of Central Security Forces were injured Sunday when their bus came under attack near border town of Rafah in northern Sinai. Militants attacked the bus with automatic weapons and fled the scene. The soldiers were heading to their camp in Rafah.
