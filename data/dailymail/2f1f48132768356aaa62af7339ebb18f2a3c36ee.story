Fatal crash: Dale Smith, 51, and four relatives died after their small plane experienced engine problems

A Silicon Valley software executive and five of his family members have been found dead more than a month after his plane vanished in the Idaho wilderness.

Dale Smith vanished after reporting engine problems as he flew himself, his son and daughter-in-law, his daughter and her fiance from Oregon to Montana after Thanksgiving on December 1.

The wreckage of the plane was found on Friday with no survivors.

Rescuers said all five victims perished in the crash and were not stranded in the wilderness.

The single-engine plane was piloted by 51-year-old Dale Smith, a software executive from San Jose, California.

Also on board were Smith's son, Daniel Smith and his wife, Sheree Smith, daughter Amber Smith and her fiance, Jonathon Norton.

The plane was flying from eastern Oregon to Montana on December 1 when it disappeared in mountains 150 miles northeast of Boise.

Authorities had suspended the search for the plane in mid-December but groups of volunteers continued to search for the family members.

Dale Smith's brother Dellon Smith, also a pilot, was the one to find the plane.

In a Facebook post, Dale Smith's wife Janis told friends that the plane had been found and thanked all the volunteers who searched.

'Less than two hours before they needed to wrap up the search for the foreseeable future, Dellon and Arthur found the plane,' she wrote.

'I am so grateful that Dellon was the one who found his brother. The plane is in pieces and buried in snow. They have not yet found all the parts. However, we do know my family members on the plane died quickly and painlessly. They did not suffer.'

The recovery effort may be delayed due to a severe storm coming in, according to the sheriff's office.

The official search for the plane was called off on December 12 due to increasingly hostile weather conditions, but volunteers kept looking.

Dellon Smith and others set out on a 
four-day search Wednesday, a last-ditch effort to find the plane before 
winter set in and the search had to be abandoned until spring.

Rand Kriech, who co-founded company SerialTek with Smith in 2007, said he got a call Friday evening, telling him the wreckage had been found.

The private search involved hundreds of online volunteers analyzing satellite images of the terrain, looking for clues like damaged trees that might indicate a crash site, and posting that information back to a search website, Kriech said in a telephone interview.

Search teams then checked promising sites.

'They were just getting ready to close up today, checking one last site - and sure enough,' Kriech said.

'It's simply amazing that so many people were volunteering so much of their time to bring the family peace,' he said. 'It's just really hard to get closure if you don't have any information.'

The
 last communication air traffic controllers in Salt Lake City received 
from Smith around 3.30pm on December 2 was that his six-seater plane, a 
Beech Bonanza, was experiencing engine troubles.

They directed him to the nearest landing site, the small and remote grass-covered Johnson Creek airstrip, which is about 125 miles north of Boise, Idaho - but the plane never landed, KTVU reported.

Friends and family said the Mormon engineer, who lived with his large family in San Jose, California, was an experienced and safe pilot.

The family had spent Thanksgiving together in Oregon just before the accident.

Fellow pilots told KTVU at the time that they were hopeful the plane had landed safely and was simply out of reach of cell phone coverage.

'We have no idea what the status of things is right now,' Valley County Shieriff's Lt. Dan Smith said. 'They could have landed safely somewhere and just can't communicate.'

Smith was taking his adult son to Montana following the Thanksgiving weekend.

Rand Kriech, who co-founded a hardware and software company, SerialTek, with Smith, said his friend was an excellent pilot.

'He's one of the safest pilots I know. A very cautious pilot,' Kriech told NBC. 'Have no fear of flying with him at all. I'm a pilot myself and I really appreciate somebody that takes as much care as Dale.'

Route: Smith and four family members took off in his plane from Oregon for Montana but reported trouble over Idaho. They were directed to land at Johnson Creek airstrip

Their company was founded in 2007 and now employs around 10 staff, online records indicate.

Others said that despite all of his accomplishments, Smith was essentially a family man who was devoted to his community and Mormon faith.

'When there was Hurricane Katrina, Dale was the first one to get in his plane, grab a bunch of members of the church and go out and help,' friend Ann Dyreng told KGO.

Smith obtained his pilot's license in 2005 and had a second-class medical certification, which allowed him to operate a commercial aircraft, the Associated Press reported.
