A ‘Lithuanian pirate’ tried to steal a millionaire’s £550,000 pleasure boat from its moorings on the Thames and sail it away, a court heard.

Ramunas Slusnys, 33, drove the luxury vessel as far as a lock before realising he was unable to get through without a booking - so turned around and parked it.

He then helped himself to a bowl of cornflakes and drank a bottle of wine on the 48-foot Fairline Phantom craft moored in St Katharine Docks, near Tower Bridge, central London.

Jailed: Ramunas Slusnys was given 18 months behind bars after being found guilty of taking the boat - but will be released immediately as he has already served the sentence while on remand

But as he made himself at home on the vessel, owner William Carter was alerted by dock staff who became suspicious and the homeless 33-year-old was arrested.

Yesterday he was jailed for 18 months at Snaresbrook Crown Court after a jury unanimously found him guilty of attempted theft of the boat and taking the bottle of wine.

However, he is expected to be released as he has already served 10 months behind bars while on remand - the equivalent of a 20 month sentence.

Slusnys, who kept his eyes shut for the entire two-day case, was arrested on the vessel on March 28.

Piers Wauchope, prosecuting, told the 
jury during the case: ‘The question you’ve got to ask yourself is 
whether he was trying to steal the boat or whether he was just taking it
without authority.

‘There are two scenarios - one in 
which he’s a sort of Lithuanian pirate in the sight of the City of 
London, taking a very expensive powerboat or intending to take it. 
Perhaps this time he was just seeing if he could work it.

Attempted theft: The Lithuanian tried to drive off in a 48-foot Fairline Phantom worth £550,000

‘The alternative is that he’s little 
more than a homeless man, although a homeless man with a knowledge of 
boats as few could manoeuvre it in the way he did without causing damage.

‘While he was there, in his desperate 
condition, he had some cornflakes and a bottle of wine but he had no 
plans and was just messing about.’

Giving evidence, Mr Carter said he had bought the boat as a pleasure craft three months before Slusnys had attempted to take it.

He added that the vessel was complex to pilot and it took extensive training to avoid damaging it.

James Mehigan, defending Slusnys, of no 
fixed address, said boat-owner William Carter had only really lost out 
to the tune of a £10 bottle of wine.

Passing sentence, Judge Timothy Lamb said it was remarkable that the Lithuanian had not had an accident in the vessel.

'It is miraculous, that having manoeuvred that boat single-handed around St Katherine's dock, that no damage resulted to it, which is also fortunate for you.

'The jury were satisfied that your intention was to make off with this asset worth half a million pounds. Before that theft they found that you stole a bottle of wine which was on the boat.

'I take full account of the fact that you are homeless and you have had problems with your health. Nonetheless, these are serious offences.'
