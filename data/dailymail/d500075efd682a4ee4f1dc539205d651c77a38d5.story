Labour has been accused of plotting a 'Bridget Jones tax' on singletons as its local authorities demand an end to council tax discounts for those living alone.

In a formal submission to ministers, the Local Government Association is calling for the power to end the 25 per cent discount offered in recognition of the fact single people place fewer demands on local services.

More than seven million are thought to benefit from the discount, at a cost of around £2.7billion a year.

But if town halls get their way a single person living in a typical Band D property would see their council tax bill rise from £1,083 to £1,444 – an increase of £361 a year, or £30 a month.

Councils are also demanding the removal of a rule that forces them to hold a referendum if they want to increase council tax. They said town halls should be free to raise council tax by as much as they like.

The LGA is an umbrella group representing hundreds of councils of different political persuasions.

But sources claim the campaign to end the discount is being driven by Labour authorities including Liverpool, Sheffield, Islington and Exeter.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: 'There is clearly a well-orchestrated campaign being pushed forward by Labour councillors to target the most vulnerable.

'This is a Bridget Jones tax and shows how out of touch Labour are.'

In its submission, the LGA calls for councils to be given the 'full and unconstrained ability to vary locally all council tax discounts, including the single person's discount'.

Councils argue the power is needed to help them deal with a 10 per cent cut in funding for discounts this year.

Local authorities are also angry at legislation forcing them to hold a local referendum if they want to increase council tax by more than 2 per cent a year. The rule was introduced following a free-for-all during Labour's years in power when council tax bills doubled.

No council has yet dared to stage a referendum, although a number raised council tax by 1.99 per cent this year.

Ministers have provided funding for a council tax freeze for three years running, equivalent to a 9.7 per cent cut in real terms for bill payers.

But more than 30 per cent of councils chose to increase their bills this year, arguing the Government could not guarantee long-term funding.

The LGA said town halls should be given 'flexibility around income generation, including council tax'.

A Government source said there is no prospect of the referendum rule being lifted.
