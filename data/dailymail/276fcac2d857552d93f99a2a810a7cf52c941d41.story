Plans to force high school girls in Indonesia to pass virginity tests in order to be allowed to graduate were met with fierce criticism by campaign groups and Muslim leaders.

The district council in Jember in East Java province was said to be drafting 'good conduct' regulations that would have forced girls at high schools to prove they had not had sex before they graduated.

However the proposals were met with fierce criticism from campaigners and Muslim leaders who said they discriminated against  girls, and the plans were eventually dropped.

Indonesia, home to the world's largest Muslim population, places a high value on virginity. 

Last year Indonesian officials admitted doing virginity tests on women seeking to join the police or military even though the practice has no scientific validity, according to the World Health Authority.

The proposals to introduce virginity tests in Jember have now been dropped, but local lawmakers defended the plans and said they hoped they would be extended across the area - home to 2.3million people.

'If they're not virgins any more, don't let them pass,'
local lawmaker Mufti Ali was quoted as telling
news site Berita.Jatim.com.

'We can't test the boys ... but at least with the
regulation, girls will be afraid. The boys will be prevented
from the act because girls will become unwilling.'

Indonesia's top Muslim clerics opposed the proposal, saying
it discriminated against female students and was contrary to
Islamic teachings.

Jember's council deputy speaker Ayub
Junaidi apologised and dropped the proposals amid widespread public condemnation of the plan.

'On behalf of the Jember Consultative Council we'd like to
apologise to the public, especially to all women and girls
across Indonesia,' he told local news site Kompas.com.

 The proposals were quietly abandoned in Jember, East Java province, after widespread public criticism

Campaign group Human Rights Watch welcomed the decision to halt the proposals but spokesman Andreas Harsono said it was
alarming that the test was still used by the police and
military. The group has called for an end to tolerance of the tests in the country.

Mr Harsono added: 'It should be stopped ... it is degrading. It isdiscriminatory. It is cruel.'

Indonesia's police force came under fire three months ago
for admitting it administered virginity tests for female police
applicants to see if their hymen was intact. A police spokesman
said the tests were part of a routine health check but there was
no requirement for women to be virgins and no discrimination.

In December Home Affairs Minister Tjahjo Kumolo announced aspiring civil servants and public administrators will no longer be required to undergo the test, but the police force refused to withdraw it. 

The practice, which is supposed to determine if the candidate's hymen is intact, has been widely discredited as unscientific and degrading.

Previous attempts to introduce virginity tests for female
students, in South Sumatra in 2013 and in West Java in 2007,
also backfired.
