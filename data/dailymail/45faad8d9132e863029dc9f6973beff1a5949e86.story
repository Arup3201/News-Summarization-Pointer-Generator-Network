Journalist Caroline Clarke has known for most of her life that she was adopted, but it was not until she turned 37 and was searching for some medical history that she found out that her grandfather was the legendary signer and jazz pianist Nat King Cole.

Clarke, a married mother of two who hosts the syndicated TV show Black Enterprise Business Report, made the shocking discovery in 2002. That same year, she reunited for the first time with her birth mother, Carole 'Cookie' Cole.

Last year, Clarke published a book about her extraordinary family titled Postcards From Cookie: A Memoir of Motherhood, Miracles and a Whole Lot of Mail.

Cole clan: Carol Cole, pictured far left as a child next to her sister Natalie and their parents, gave birth to a baby daughter in 1964. She was forced to put her up for adoption because she was conceived out of wedlock 

For Clarke, it all started when a mystery pain in her joints forced her to reach out to a social worker in hopes of obtaining her birth mother's medical history.

But the woman at Spence-Chaplin Adoption Services did one better and voluntarily  provided Clarke not only with her family's medical records, but also with a seven-page report detailing her mother’s personal history, down to her major in college. 

What the Ivy League-educated journalist learned was that she was born on Christmas Day in 1964 at Lenox Hill Hospital to an exceptionally wealthy and famous black family, but her 20-year-old mother was not allowed to raise her because Clarke was conceived out of wedlock, and the scandal could have damaged her grandfather's reputation, reported the New York Daily News back in April.

Memoir: Caroline Clarke wrote a book about her incredible family in 2014, five years after the passing of her biological mother 

By the time Clarke was born, Nat King Cole, her maternal grandfather, was one of the most celebrated entertainers in the country. The singer, his wife and their five children lived in a 20-room mansion in a tony part of Los Angeles where they hosted lavish parties for their famous friends.

Born Nathaniel Adams Coles, Nat King Cole emerged in the post-World War II era as a trailblazing black performer, best known for such chart-topping hits as Mona Lisa and Unforgettable. He also held the distinction of being the first African-American man to host a show on NBC.

That is why when the family learned that the singer's eldest unwed daughter, Carole, became pregnant, her mother made the decision to put the child up for adoption.

Determined to keep her child, whom she named Gretchen, Carole Cole initially refused to sign the adoption papers, but she finally relented upon learning that her 45-year-old father was dying of lung cancer.

‘I lost my baby in December. I lost my father in February. I lost my soul,’ Carole Cole would write in her journal.

Not long after, Robert and Vera Clarke, an African-American couple from The Bronx, adopted little Gretchen and renamed her Caroline. Her adoptive father was a college professor while her mother taught high school. Nat King Cole's music was ever present in the Clarkes' home on Wilson Avenue.

By her own account, Caroline Clarke enjoyed a happy childhood marked by joyous celebrations and summers spent at her adoptive uncle's home in Long Island.

It was during one of those family get-togethers that she met her future husband, John Graves, at the age of 7.

Clarke went on to earn a Bachelor's degree from Smith College and a Master's degree from the prestigious Columbia University School of Journalism.

In an unexpected twist of fate, during her time as an undergraduate student, Clarke met and became close friends with Timolin ‘Timmie’ Cole, one of Nat King Cole's younger children who had a twin sister, Casey.

Keeping up appearances: Maria Cole (far right) insisted that Carole put her child up for adoption. The Clarke family, from The Bronx, New York, raised little Caroline as their own

Over the course of their 20-year friendship, Clarke got to know the Cole family well and was told about Timmie Cole's much older sister, Carole, who was an actress in Hollywood, and who put up her baby for adoption.

Carole Cole herself was adopted by Nat King Cole and his wife, Maria, after Maria's sister died in her youth.

After learning the truth about her heritage, Caroline Clarke recalled how at age 17, she was invited to a sleepover at Maria Cole’s penthouse at the Ritz Carlton in Boston.

That night, Nat King Cole’s imperious widow questioned Caroline about her date of birth, the hospital where she was born and the circumstances of her adoption.

At the time, Caroline Clarke thought nothing of Maria Cole’s very personal line of questioning. It was not years later that the conversation came back to haunt her.

In 2002, Caroline Clarke finally reached out to her birth mother after getting her phone number from her friend, Timmie, who was actually her aunt.

The mother and daughter reunited later that year and kept in touch, mostly via postcards, for the next seven years, until Carole Cole passed away from cancer in 2009.

Truth comes to light: Caroline Clarke, the host of the TV show Black Enterprise Business Report, reached out to a social worker in 2002 to obtain medical history, but she got so much more than that 

Over the course of their relationship, Carole Clarke was shocked to learn that her biological father was a white Jewish man whom her mother met in college, and who knew nothing of her existence.

Clarke, a strong, independent black woman who married into the family that owned Black Enterprise, initially struggled to accept that she was a person of mixed race.

‘I was raised black in a black family, very happily, proudly, adamantly black. And finding out that my birth father was white was jolting,’ she revealed to the site The Root.

In the end, however, Clarke was glad to uncover her  family history, with all its dark secrets and unexpected twists and turns.

‘My feelings have evolved,' Clarke said in an interview with Smith College's news site. I accept that I am what I am genetically. Mixed-race is such a common reality now; the culture has evolved, which helps. But I still identify as African American.’
