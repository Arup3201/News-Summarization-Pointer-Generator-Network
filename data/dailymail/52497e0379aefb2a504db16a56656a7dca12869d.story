One of the three people to win $564.1 million in this week's Powerball was from Puerto Rico.

And Twitter went crazy.

The Atlantic island has been U.S. territory since 1898, with its inhabitants subject to U.S. taxes.

But it seems those facts are well-kept secrets in the mainland. 

'WTF .... since when could you win a Powerball jackpot in Puerto Rico? Don't they use the Euro as currency?' exclaimed @Matty_lee87.

'If #PuertoRico is too good to be a state, then they don't deserve to win our #Powerball! #Shenanigans' @DillonChance surmised.

The lucky Puerto Rican, who has yet to be identified, will be sharing their lot with somebody from Texas and one from North Carolina. 

While the latter two have been broadly accepted by the cyber world, their islander neighbor came under some flak. 

Latino Rebels reported that the backlash started when Lisa Sanchez, of KLAQ Morning Show, said on the radio that Puerto Ricans should not be eligible to enter the draw because the island is not a state.

Her Twitter account is no longer active. 

Her comment was followed by hundreds like this from @Sniper, who fumed: 'If I'm the guy from Texas or NC I'm pissed I have to share the powerball with someone from Puerto Rico. Should have to speak English to win.'

Reaction: Puerto Ricans hit back at the slew of comments slamming their island as 'foreign'

Reacting to the outburst, Julio Ricardo Varela, editor and founder of Latino Rebels, wrote in a blog post: 'This silly story was the perfect storm of so many issues: culture, identity, colonialism, history and oh yeah, the Powerball drawing.

'The hope here is that this post forced the conversation so that more Americans dedicate real attention to Puerto Rico and its people in a way that goes beyond ignorant tweets. 

'I know that sounds silly, but when one ridiculous story basically gets more traffic in one day than what this entire page got in 2011 you tend to believe that the topic truly matters, and you just hope this new energy can lead to real dialogue.'

The only identified winner so far is mother-of-four Marie Holmes, 26, from Shallotte, North Carolina.

Holmes said that she scared her kids, one of whom has cerebral palsy, after she found out she had won and began screaming that they 'didn't have to struggle anymore'.

Historic: The Powerball jackpot  reached $500 million for Wednesday night's draw, making it the fifth largest prize in U.S. history

Yeehaw!: The Texas lottery tweeted tonight that they have a Powerball winner somewhere in their state 

She used to work at McDonald's and Walmart before quitting to take care of her children. 

The numbers of the fifth largest jackpot in U.S. history were revealed at 11 p.m. on Wednesday.

The winning numbers for the $564.1 million jackpot were 11-13-25-39-54. The Powerball red number was 19 and the Powerplay was 3x.

The $500 million pot - which equates to a cash value of $337.8 million - had been building steadily for two months.

If no one were to win the Powerball then the jackpot for the next drawing on February 14 could have equaled $650 million making it one of the largest lottery game jackpots in U.S. history.

To win, the players needed five numbers and the Powerball number. The odds of winning are one in 175 million.

Each ticket costs just $2.

The lottery is played in 44 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The Powerball jackpot was last won on November 29. A Washington woman who bought her first-ever lottery tickets on a whim on Thanksgiving Day won $90 million.

February 2014 was the last time that the Powerball reached the current prize amount.

Jackpot winners receive either payments over 29 years or a smaller cash lump sum.
