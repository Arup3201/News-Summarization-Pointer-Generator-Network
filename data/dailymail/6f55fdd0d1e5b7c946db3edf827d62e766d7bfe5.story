Medical experts are urging parents to be aware of the potential risks loom bands (pictured) pose after four children were taken to hospital in one week with loom bands stuck up their noses

Parents need to be more aware of the dangers of loom bands amid the potential for the popular accessory to become lodged in children's noses, a report has warned.

Four children were treated at a Scottish hospital in just one week after the rubber bands became stuck, according to an article in the Journal of Laryngology & Otology.

Loom bands - tiny loops of elastic in different colours that can be linked together to create low-cost jewellery such as necklaces and bracelets - have become something of a craze, with even the Duchess of Cambridge and pop star Harry Styles seen wearing them.

But they have also been linked to a string of mishaps in which children have been hospitalised for injuries that include damaged eyesight.

In a paper entitled Loom bands and young children - a tragedy waiting to happen? staff from the ENT Department at Monklands Hospital in Airdrie, said there had been a surge in the popularity of the bands recently, and urged people to be aware of the potential risks.

In September, Kyle Lawrence, 7, was left with permanent sight damage after his brother accidentally flicked one of the popular bands into his eye while they were making a bracelet.

The Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, youngster developed a cataract, which led to lasting muscle damage to his left eye.

The report's authors said: 'Although the four cases presented were resolved without the need for general anaesthetic, the ever-soaring prevalence and popularity of loom bands necessitates a degree of caution and vigilance from parents, retailers and manufacturers alike.

'We believe there is an urgent need for greater public awareness of their potential hazards.'

There is a risk of inhalation when objects become stuck in nasal passages, obstructing the airway, they added.

In August one of the country's leading toy stores removed loom band charms from its shelves after they were found to contain potentially harmful chemicals.

The Entertainer said the charms could contain phthalates, which can disrupt hormones in children.

The chemicals, which are used to soften plastics, have been banned in toys on sale in the European Union for several years.

Manchester-based RMS International, which supplied the charms to The Entertainer, said the incident involved only a number of PVC loom charms, adding that loom bands are 'entirely safe'.

The colourful rubber bands are woven together to make friendship bracelets and have been worn by high profile celebrities well as children.

While a computer game can cost £40, 1,800 loom bands are as little as £2.50. They are already Amazon’s eighth best-selling toy of all time, after classics such as the Rubik’s Cube, Monopoly and Scrabble.

Mark Lambert took this photo of his son Brandon, to show him how dangerous loom bands can be. The eight-year-old is pictured when two of his fingers went black after he fell asleep with loom bands wrapped around them

In July, eight-year-old Brandon Lambert's fingers went black after he fell asleep with the elastic bands wrapped around two digits.

Fortunately, his father Mark checked on him half an hour after he fell asleep and removed them.

The scare left the 36-year-old warning his son could have lost his fingers if the circulation of blood to his fingers had remained cut off.

He said: ‘I don’t usually check on Brandon, but I am so glad I did. If the bands had stayed on his fingers all night then he might have had to get them amputated. The circulation had been completely cut off.

‘I took a picture quickly because I wanted to show Brandon how dangerous they can be. He was shocked when he saw the picture.’

The landscape gardener, who lives in Skipton, North Yorkshire, with his wife Donna, 32, a carer, added: ‘Brandon spends up to six hours a day at the weekend playing with loom bands, but nothing like this has happened before.

‘They are marketed as a fun and safe product but I don’t think they are. They are like elastic bands, and elastic bands are not child-friendly. They can be dangerous.’
