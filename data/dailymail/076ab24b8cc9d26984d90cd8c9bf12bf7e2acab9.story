Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers believes his side's slow start to the Premier League season is partly down to the club having to sign 'a lot of new players' as they look to compete on four fronts this season.

The Reds have lost two of their first four Premier League games so far this season, but Rodgers believes it's just a matter of time before his players click into gear.

He said: 'We've had to bring in a lot of new players this summer because of the Champions League. Naturally that takes a bit more time but I've been really pleased with the way everyone has settled in. We've got players adapting to different counties.

'We will just continue to work hard. The players have got great qualities but it will take a bit of time for that to show through. There's no magic formula it's just time.'

'Our form last year was incredible but we were not playing like that this time last year. The players need to settle.'

Rodgers also admitted that his side 'weren't at the level' he expects as they crumbled to a 1-0 defeat against Aston Villa last weekend.

Liverpool were beaten by a first half strike from Gabriel Agbonlahor last Saturday as Rodgers' side failed to convert a number of chances at Anfield.

He added: 'Last week against Aston Villa we weren't at the level we expect in the final third.

'They defended well and got the result, but we move on. In reflection, beating Ludogorets was a very good result, even if maybe people thought we'd win more comfortably. Southampton's good form has shown how well we did to beat them, and we were outstanding against Tottenham.

'The international break came at a bad time for us and we lost some of our players, which upset our rhythm, but we'll continue to work hard.'

Rodgers has also given his backing to misfiring midfielder Philippe Coutinho after the Brazilian's disappointing start to the season.

The 22-year-old has started three of the Reds' four league matches but last weekend's defeat to Aston Villa was the first time he completed 90 minutes, while he was also taken off in their Champions League win over Bulgarian minnows Ludogorets.

In Liverpool's best performance so far - the 3-0 win at Tottenham - Coutinho was left on the bench throughout and the early part of the campaign has seen him fail to showcase the talent he has displayed intermittently since his arrival in January 2013.

However, Rodgers has no doubt about the Brazilian's quality or ability.

'He's a brilliant young player, a fantastic young player,' he said.

'I had planned to leave him out of the game against Aston Villa because he'd had a lot of travelling in the international week, and if we didn't have so many injuries he would have been given a rest on the side and then played in the Champions League game.

'We couldn't afford to do that. We had to play him, but it was great for him and his experience getting back into the Brazilian squad.

'I've got no qualms about him; he's a big, big talent. He has lit up the Premier League since he came to the club.

'He's going to have some games where he won't be at his best, but he always gives his best and that's all I ever ask of the players.

'The kid is a great boy who wants to do well. He's very conscious that I have absolutely no doubts about him.'
