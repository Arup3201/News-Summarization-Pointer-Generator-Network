A tourist resort in Tuscany could start using drones to assist lifeguards within the next two months, according to reports in Italy.

Bosses at Forte dei Marmi, a beach resort popular with the rich and famous, want to introduce the technology as a way of transporting life jackets and communicating with distressed swimmers from the shore.

They say that the drones are likely to be quicker and more efficient at providing life jackets to swimmers than people.

Forte dei Marmi has been a popular holiday destination for wealthy holidaymakers since the 1960s.

The population of the town, around 7,700, nearly triples during the summer, because of the hundreds of tourist who come mainly from Florence, Milan, Germany, and Russia.

Among the area’s most famous residents is designer Giorgio Armani, who built his first holiday home there in the 1980s.

Roberto Santini, who owns the exclusive Piero beachclub, said he is in favour of introducing the technology, which is said to have been developed by an Iranian manufacturer.

‘We don’t want to replace the traditional lifeguards,’ Santini told local newspaper Versilia Today.

‘They’ve always been indispensable, but we want to give them more support. We are confident that in a couple of months we will be able to use the drones.’

Stefano Russo, of Italdron – which makes drones used for aerial images and data collection – says civilian drones in Italy are currently mostly used by photographers and surveyors.

‘It is a very new topic for people,’ he says. ‘The media is always talking about drones being good for things like delivering pizza.

‘I think it’s possible to use drones for life-guarding, but it’s more like experimentation than real-world usage.’

The  drone is touted as being capable of communicating via a loudspeaker.

The concept has the backing of the mayor of Forte dei Marmi, Umberto Buratti, though he also emphasised concerns about safety.

‘It is necessary that this new application meets all the safety requirements and is run by people who are adequately prepared,’ he said.

Drones used by unauthorised people would be confiscated, he added.

The machines, also called unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs, are currently used in war-zones and military operations to provide an effective means of gathering intelligence and venturing into hostile areas without the need of a pilot.

The machines were first used in WWII, but there have been significant developments in the technology since then.

It has even been suggested that large mail order companies could develop UAVs to deliver their goods to customers in the future.

It was in 2013 that the chief executive of Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, revealed the company had been testing unmanned drones to deliver goods.

Aviation authorities are currently in the process of drafting rules for the commercial use of drones for everything from TV news coverage to package delivery to crop monitoring.

Forte dei Marmi is not the only beach looking at using drones. Officials near the iconic Bondi beach in Australia are considering to use drones to help detect sharks, according to reports.

In 2013, Iranian-based laboratory RTS revealed that they were developing a drone specifically designed to fly to the relief of people drowning near coastlines.

Equipped with four rotors, the makers say it will be able to carry three life jackets as well as record sound and take pictures.

The manufacturers also claim it will also be able to detect lifejackets in the water and feature a heat-sensing camera which is able to detect objects in the dark.

Once the drone locates individuals in the water, manufacturers say victims will be able to shout at it which will activate a system that drops a life jacket.

Makers claim it has an inbuilt GPS system and will be able to return from its rescue mission without user guidance.
