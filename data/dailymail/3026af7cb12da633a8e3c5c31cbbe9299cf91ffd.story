In the wake of the embarrassing 'bridgegate' scandal, a new poll has revealed that Americans now have a largely unfavorable opinion of the New Jersey Governor and presidential hopeful Chris Christie.

However, among his core Republican supporters, Christie's approval ratings are almost unchanged from before the September 2013 closure of the George Washington Bridge as revenge against the mayor of Fort Lee, New Jersey by Christie staff.

The survey found that 51 per cent of Republicans say they have a favorable opinion of Christie while 33 per cent have an unfavorable opinion.

Taking a dive: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (seen here in March) has lost favor with Independents and Democrats but his fellow Republicans haven't wavered

Overall, 45 per cent of Americans have an unfavorable opinion of Christie, and 34 per cent have a favorable opinion.

These figures show a dramatic drop since January, when another YouGov/Huffington Post poll found that just 34 per cent of respondents said they had an unfavorable view of the New Jersey Governor, and 38 per cent had a positive view of him.

Increasingly, Americans are mistrustful of Christie, with 36 per cent saying they believe he is lying when he says he didn't know anything about his staff's involvement in causing the bridge bottleneck - though 48 per cent of Republicans believe he is telling the truth, as opposed to 19 per cent who believe he's lying.

The drop in approval is almost entirely among Democrats and Independents, who largely believe Christie lied about his involvement in bridgegate and that he is an unfavorable candidate.

As for Christie's presidential hopes, 10 per cent of Republicans 'definitely' plan to support his nomination, while 32 per cent would consider it.

Massive holdups: Two of three lanes on the George Washington Bridge were closed between September 9-13 at the behest of Christie staffers without warning to the public or emergency services

Christie has maintained throughout the scandal that he was ignorant of any revenge plot hatched by his staff.

A law firm handpicked by Christie himself somewhat unsurprisingly found that he was not involved in the bridge closure scheme.

The tax-payer funded, self-commissioned report came out ahead of any results from independent investigations by federal prosecutors and a special committee of state lawmakers.Â 

A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll conducted in October - before the scandal erupted - showed that just 17 per cent of Americans viewed Christie negatively, a dramatic difference from today's results.

The September 9 lane closure on the George Washington Bridge caused a threat to public safety, not to mention inconvenience to residents.

Local area officials and emergency services officers, as well as the general public, were not notified of the lane closures, and there were multiple cases in which emergency services responses were delayed.
