The growing divide in home ownership was laid bare today, with millions of young people struggling to get on to the property ladder.

While three quarters of over-55s home their own home just a third of under-35s have managed to buy a property.

Rising house prices and tougher mortgage checks have been blamed for the trend, which means overall levels of home ownership are now at their lowest since the 1980s.

The latest English Housing Survey reveals that in 2012-13, there were 22million households in England. Overall, 65.2 per cent were owner occupied, 18 per cent were privately rented and 17 per cent were socially rented.

By contrast, at the end of the First World War in 1918, three quarters of households in England were private renters, a quarter were in owner occupation and less than 1 per cent were in social rented accommodation, the EHS said.

The boom in people buying their own homes instead of renting came in the 1980s, when the number of families living in a property they had bought increasing from 9.9million in 1981 to 12.2million in 1988.

However, the impact recessions in the 1990s and the financial crash in 2007 has made access to mortgages more difficult.

The number of owner occupiers has fallen every year since 2006, and in 2012-13 reached its lowest level since the 1980s, (14.3million).

However, renting a home costs much more than buying one through a mortgage, the survey revealed.

Families in the process of paying off a property spent 20 per cent of their income on their mortgage.

But private renters spent 40 per cent and social renters 30 per cent of their income on rent.

Alex Hilton, director of Generation Rent, said: ‘Renters spend two days every week working to pay off their landlord’s mortgage.

‘This is a financial thumbscrew applied to people who simply have no other choice of tenure and it’s hard to see how this can be characterised as anything other than exploitation.

‘This underlines the urgency of the need for affordable housebuilding and tenancy law reform.’
