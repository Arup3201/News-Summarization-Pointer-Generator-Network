Whether it's Brussels sprouts or black pudding, Brits have been revealed as the most likely to leave food on their plates.

And although they’re heralded as an international 
delicacy and served in restaurants across the world, snails topped the list as most hated food.

Tripe, oysters, squid and 
anchovies also made up the top end of the ‘gastro-dislike’ list.

The Fussy Food Nation Report also found that amongst the top 20 most hated foods were liver, 
olives, black pudding, kippers, blue cheese, beetroot, sardines, and 
Brussels sprouts, which may not surprise many.

What may come as a shock to foodies is
the fact that delicacies such as avocado, goats’ cheese, pate, prawns 
and mushrooms have made the top 40 most disliked foods, which shows that
once and for all we’re a nation of fussy eaters.

And it's children that are the biggest culprits 
when it comes to refusing to eat certain foods with 39% being fussy eaters, while 24% of fathers are fussy followed narrowly by mothers at 23%.

Escargot was voted the most hated food above tripe and oysters

A staggering 54% of people in relationships say their partner is a fussier eater than they are, with a tenth of Brits 
even resent their partner sometimes because they don’t like a food that 
they enjoy eating (10%).

A quarter of the 2,000 people studied 
feel their own diet suffers because their mother, father or sibling 
refuses to eat particular foods.

It's not just partners that 
prove fussy - forty per cent of parents confessed they'd gone to huge 
extents to get their kids eating greens by bribing their children to eat
the food in front of them.

The study, which was 
conducted by Hotpoint to mark the launch of the Active Oxygen fridge 
freezer, which keeps food fresher for longer, also revealed 41% of 
parents sneak healthy foods into their children's meals to ensure they 
are getting nutrition.

Not only are we fussy eaters but also just under half of us say we don’t eat as healthily as we should, one in five of us say this is because fresh food tends to spoil quickly, with most of us saying we’re simply too busy to eat healthily.

The study also asked people what puts them off certain foods, with almost 60% saying the texture and more than half saying the smell.

One in seven say being forced to eat a certain food as a child has left them hating it forever, while a similar number say they hate certain foods so much they physically make them ill.

Cook, food writer and broadcaster Valentine Warner said: 'I’m astounded that so few people enjoy eating beetroot, it’s one of my all-time favourite vegetables.

'Perhaps everyone has been put off by the slightly limp, pickled sort in jars? When eaten fresh, it’s delicious.

'I’d implore people to try more foods and to not be put off by previous experiences; yes, even snails can actually be very tasty. Experiencing new food is a joy, you may not like everything but it’s trial and error and in my experience, the more you try things the more you get to like them.'

When it comes to our children, four in ten of us have had to resort to desperate measures to get them to eat their vegetables, with steps ranging from ‘sneaking’ them onto their plate, or ‘hiding’ them in a recipe, to bribing them with money in a last ditch attempt to encourage healthy eating.

Typically the humble Brussels sprout, mushrooms and spinach feature among the most challenging foods to convince our children to eat.
