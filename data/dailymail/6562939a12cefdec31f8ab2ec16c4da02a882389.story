'Birdman' Steve Elkins faces ruin after unsuccessfully suing the organisers of the Worthing International Birdman Competition

A birdman who was inches from winning a £30,000 prize in a contest to fly 100 metres faces ruin after unsuccessfully suing the organisers.

Hang-glider designer Steve Elkins, 51, of Hope, Derbyshire, claimed to have flown the required distance from Worthing Pier in West Sussex during the annual birdman contest in 2009.

But organisers Worthing Town Centre Initiative said he was short by 14cm – less than 6in – and denied him the prize.

Judge Jonathan Simpkiss ruled at Brighton County Court that they had been correct not to pay out and ordered Mr Elkins to pay WTCI’s £60,000 court costs – £20,000 of it within 28 days.

'I'm quite surprised and quite shocked,’ Mr Elkins said. ‘I have been a fool in some ways.’

WTCI said it had to fight the case or it would not be able to get insurance for the prize, putting the event in jeopardy.

The dispute has been ongoing since 2009 when Steve claimed to have flown the 100 metre distance required to claim the prize at the Worthing International Birdman competition.

The organisers claimed he was 14 centimetres short and ruled his flight was 99.86 metres.

The total cost of TCI's legal fees was £60,000, made up of solicitor and QC costs and expert witness costs.

Sharon Clarke, manager of the TCI said: 'We are certainly not rejoicing, it's been a torrid time for all of us.

'Mr Elkins chose to take these actions and he should have been aware of the implications.'

Judge Simpkiss said: 'It's one of those things that's happened that would have been much better if it hadn't.'

He claimed to have flown the required distance from Worthing Pier during the annual contest in 2009. But the organisers Worthing Town Centre Initiative said he was short by 14cm and denied him the prize. A judge upheld that decision and Mr Elkins now faces paying WTCI's costs of £60,000.
