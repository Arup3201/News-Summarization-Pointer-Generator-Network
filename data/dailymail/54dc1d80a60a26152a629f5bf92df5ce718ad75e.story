A mother under investigation for letting her two young children walk a mile home from the park by themselves has spoken out to publicly defend 'free-range parenting'. 

Danielle Meitiv appeared on the Today show Monday morning with her children Rafi, 10, and Dvora, six. Just before Christmas, the two children were walking about a mile home from a park near their Maryland home when police officers stopped them and asked why they were alone. 

The officers escorted the Meitiv children home, launching a Child Protective Services investigation into Danielle and her husband Alexander's competence as parents. 

But Mrs Meitiv doesn't think she they did anything wrong in giving her children a little independence.

What's wrong? Danielle Meitiv (right) appeared on the Today show on Monday with her 10-year-old son Rafi (center) and 6-year-old daughter Dvora about a month after Child Protective Services launched an investigation because she let the two walk home from a park alone

Walking home alone: Rafi said his parents let him take short walks alone or with his sister in a practice known as 'free-range parenting'

'We're just doing what our parents did. It was considered perfectly normal just one generation ago,' she said on Today. 

Free-range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so-called 'helicopter parenting'.

'Helicopter parents' are named for their habit of hovering over their offspring, micro-managing their lives in an attempt to keep them safe.

However critics believe this creates under-confident, over-reliant children, while also causing the parents stress.

Free-range parents advocate a more hands-off approach, where children are allowed to go out and experience the world on their own.

Instead of constantly monitoring activities to make sure children are safe, the emphasis is put on adults assessing risk ahead of time, and equipping children with the skills to deal with danger themselves.

Mrs Meitiv admits that the walk back from the park was longer than her two kids had taken before, but says she wasn't worried because they have been on several shorter walks together with no issues. 

'Well I've walked home from school before. Not with my sister, but I've done it alone,' 10-year-old Rafi said. 'We walked around the block a lot and we walk home from another park which is just around the block. 

The Meitivs describe themselves as 'free-range parents' who encourage their two children to take journeys without supervision in order to build confidence and teach them about the outside world. 

Usually they have the kids carry around a card that reads 'I'm not lost. I'm a free range kid' but they left them behind that day when they went to the park that was a bit further away from their house.

Someone saw the two kids walking alone and called 911, and about three police officers stopped the children as they were about halfway home.

While Mrs Meitiv says her children assured the officers that they knew where they were going, the police escorted them home to talk to her husband, Alexander Meitiv. 

Mrs Meitiv wasn't home at the time, but says the officers were aggressive to her husband, and that her son called her crying, fearing that he would be arrested. 

'He was shocked. He sees three police officers with our kids. And they didn't really explain what was going on so it was kind of uncomfortable. They asked for ID. He said he felt they were really aggressive,' she said. 

Journey: On December 20, the brother and sister were walking about a mile home from this park when a citizen called 911 after seeing the two without their parents 

When Child Protective Services later showed up at the house, she says they threatened her husband if he didn't sign a form, promising to supervise his children at all times until a follow up appointment. 

'He said I don't want to sign this without talking to a lawyer or talking to my wife. And she said if you don't sign this we're going to take the children right now and she called the police,' she said. 

The Meitivs are still under investigation by CPS. Mrs Meitiv says she understands why other parents wouldn't let their children walk alone, but doesn't believe her decision to give her children more freedom makes her a bad mother. 

'I think what's really unfortunate is we're really overestimating the danger and underestimating our children. 

'And in fact what's really sad is that by driving our kids instead of letting them walk, we're actually endangering them more because the number one cause of death for children this age are actually car accidents. 

'So letting children walk is not only good for their health, it's actually safer than driving.' 

Parenting choice: Mrs Meitiv (pictured) says she and husband Alexander often let their children Rafi, ten, and Dvora, six, walk alone to teach them about the world

Alex and Danielle have yet to learn whether any further action will be taken against them, but say whatever happens next, the experience has left them furious.

Mrs Meitiv previously told the Washington Post: 'I think what CPS considered neglect, we felt was an essential part of growing up and maturing. 

'We feel we’re being bullied into a point of view about child-rearing that we strongly disagree with.' 

A CPS spokeswoman told the Post that they couldn't comment on individual cases, but pointed to state law which says children under eight must be left with a responsible person aged at least 13.

Police said they could not find information on the case, but a spokeswoman said that when concerns are reported, 'we have a responsibility as part of our duty to check on people’s welfare.'
