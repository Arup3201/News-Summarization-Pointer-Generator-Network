Humiliated: A woman (not pictured) was stripped half-naked and paraded on a donkey by members of her village in India after she was accused of murdering her nephew by the dead man's wife

A woman was stripped half-naked and paraded on a donkey through her village in  India after being accused of killing her nephew, police said today.

Members of the village also blackened her face with coal dust and cut her hair following orders from a local council of elders in Rajasthan, the police officer said.

Thirty-nine people, mostly members of the village of Thurval in Rajsamand district, have been arrested over the incident that took place on Saturday night, additional superintendent of police Sudhir Joshi said.

The woman was accused by the village council of killing her nephew who had died some time earlier, the officer said.

'The woman aged around 40 years was in her house when some villagers stormed into the house and pulled her out on Saturday evening,' Joshi told the AFP news agency..

'They cut her hair, blackened her face and stripped her half-naked. 

'Then they mounted her on a donkey and paraded her in the village for ten minutes,' he said.

'It was after a meeting of the panchayat (village elders). 

'The cruel punishment was meted out to the woman just on a suspicion,' he said. 

The nephew, named locally as Vardi Singh, had died on November 2, but police said the circumstances his death were not known, mainly because the villagers had cremated his body without informing officers. 

The officer said that Mr Singh's wife suspected that his aunt killed him.

The woman was now being cared for by family members, the officer added. 

Councils made up of village elders - usually known as 'khap panchayats' - are common in rural parts of India, especially in the north, where they are often accused of dispensing 'Taliban-style justice'.

Their diktats are often unconstitutional and illegal, but they continue to hold sway with rules seen as regressive by women's rights activists.

In September this year, 13 men were jailed in West Bengal state for gang-raping a woman who was accused by the local council of 'dishonouring' her village.

The council ordered the attack against the 20-year-old woman for the perceived offence of having a relationship with a man from a different community.
