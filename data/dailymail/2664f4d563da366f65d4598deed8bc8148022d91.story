Protests against rail fare rises will be held across the country today as it emerged that the cost of train travel next year will be 40 per cent higher than in 2008.

Campaigners say January’s rise will be the sixth time in seven years rail fares have outstripped wages.

Although ticket prices will have risen by 40 per cent since 2008, average earnings are only expected to have increased by 15 per cent.

Protests against rail fare rises will be held across the country today as it emerged that the cost of train travel next year will be 40 per cent higher than in 2008

The TUC and the Action For Rail campaign group will stage demonstrations at almost 50 stations to mark the publication of the latest retail price index (RPI) inflation figure, which is used to calculate next year’s rail fare rise.

Analysts predict the RPI will be 3.3 per cent today, which would see regulated rail fares rise 4.3 per cent in January, well above average wage rises.

The TUC warned some season tickets could rise 9 per cent against forecasts of a 2.4 per cent increase in average earnings next year.

It said rail privatisation was costing taxpayers £1.2billion a year despite ‘minimal’ investment in trains and stations.

General secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘Every year, hard-pressed rail commuters have to hand over an ever greater share of their earnings just to get to and from work.

‘Wage-busting fare rises are not even going on much-needed service improvements. Instead, passenger and public subsidies are lining the pockets of the shareholders of private rail companies.’

Stephen Joseph, of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: ‘Getting to work is the biggest single monthly outgoing for many commuters, more than food, more than housing. 

‘One of the surest ways of stamping on any green shoots of recovery is to price people off the trains and out of the jobs market.’

Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers’ union Aslef, said: ‘The increased costs of travel, and the inability of some to afford to travel, contrasts with the increased profits made by train companies.’

Julia Long, of the Unite union, said: ‘The current system of privately-owned operators is haemorrhaging enough cash each year to cut fares by at least 18 per cent without reducing staff or services. Yet every year we see fares soar way beyond the inflation rate.’

But Michael Roberts, chief executive of the Association of Train Operating Companies, said: ‘Government determines how the average season ticket price rise is set each year. Since 2004, it has been Government policy to allow regulated fares to rise above inflation to support investment in more trains, better stations and faster services.

‘This is helping to drive passenger satisfaction to near record levels while seeking to reduce taxpayers’ contribution towards the cost of running the railways.

‘To help limit future fare rises, the rail industry is working with the Government to find ways of providing services even more efficiently.’
