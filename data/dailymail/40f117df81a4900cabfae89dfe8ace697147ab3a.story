The White House confirmed on Monday that President Barack Obama knew about Hillary Clinton's private email address because he emailed her at it during her tenure of secretary of state. 

When Obama said in an interview that aired Sunday that he found out Clinton used a private email account to conduct official business at 'the same time as everybody else learned it through news reports,' what he meant was that was the first he'd heard of her exclusive use of use of personal email and of her private server, his spokesman clarified this afternoon.

'The president, as I think many people expected, did over the course of his first several years in office trade emails with his secretary of state,' White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters.

'I would not describe the number of emails as large, but they did have the occasion to email each other.'

'Same time as everybody else': President Obama told CBDS News he learned Hilary Clinton had used a private email account for  state business during her tenure as Secretary of State when news reports surfaced

In an interview with CBS News during his trip to Selma, Alabama, Obama had defended former Secretary of State Clinton and applauded her decision to release the emails.

'I'm glad that Hillary's instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed,' Obama said. 'I think that the fact that she is putting them forward will allow us to make sure that people have the information they need,' 

'The policy of my administration is to encourage transparency, which is why my emails, the Blackberry I carry around, all those records are available and archived,' Obama said.

Clinton, seen as the front-runner for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 2016, said on Wednesday she wanted the State Department to publish her emails so that the public could read them. 

Pressed by reporters to acknowledge that the president had in fact emailed his secretary of state during her four-year tenure,his spokesman said Monday, 'The point that the president was making is not that he didn’t know Secretary Clinton’s email address, he did.'

'But he was not aware of the details of how that email address and that server had been set up or how Secretary Clinton and her team were planning to comply with the Federal Records Act,' Earnest explained. 

Earnest said he did not know when the White House's Office of Legal Council first knew of Clinton's private email and server system. 

'It is the responsibility of individual agencies to establish an email system and to make sure those emails as created are properly recorded and maintained,' he again told reporters during the briefing, standing by his statements from last week.

He also stuck by the White House's stance that there's no 'reason to doubt' that Clinton's team has not done 'exactly what they said they would do' and give the State Department a copy of all of her work-related emails.

'But ultimately that is the responsibility of Secretary Clinton and her team,' he said.

Responding to a question about a House committee's investigation into the 2012 assault on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi and committee chair Trey Gowdy's suspicions that Hillary may be withholding pertinent emails, Earnest challenged the reporter or Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican, to produce evidence of foul play. 

And if Gowdy 'has specific questions about specific emails that should be produced in response to a legitimate congressional inquiry, then he should raise that directly with State Department officials, Earnest said.

Asked by the same reporter, Bloomberg's Justin Sink, if the White House feels it now needs to step in because the State Department 'doesn't seem to be doing its job,' Earnest said that was 'one step too far.'

The State Department has cooperated at 'great length' with the eight committees have investigated the Benghazi terrorist attack, he contended.

Moments later, he again went after Gowdy, saying, he 'would hazard a guess that if the White House were intimately involved in that kind of effort to review email and make determinations about what should be provided to Congress, that he'd be complaining about that on national television as well.' 

The growing controversy over Clinton's use of personal email for work while she was U.S. secretary of state threatens to cloud the expected launch of her campaign. 

A senior State Department official told Reuters last Thursday that a review of her emails would not happen quickly.

'The review is likely to take several months given the sheer volume of the document set,' the official said.  

The State Department has said there was no prohibition during Clinton's tenure on using personal email for official business as long as it was preserved.

A total of 55,000 pages of documents covering the time Clinton was in office has been turned over, according to the State Department. 

But Clinton and her aides controlled that process, and the emails were not archived on government servers.
