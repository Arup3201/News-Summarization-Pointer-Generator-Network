Clemson University has stopped all fraternity activities one day after a student died falling 20ft off a bridge into a lake following a run with his frat brothers. 

Tucker Hipps, 19, was found dead on Monday night under a highway bridge hours after the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity reported him missing.

However, the South Carolina university and police have so far not tied the death to fraternity hazing despite mounting social media speculation that he died during an initiation ritual.

Hipps, 19, was running with fellow Sigma Phi Epsilon members before dawn on Monday when he started falling behind, authorities said. Fraternity members noticed Hipps wasn't at breakfast and reported him missing to university police at 1:45 p.m.  

Authorities are currently investigating claims that 19-year-old student Tucker Hipps' recent death was hazing-related

 His body was found under the bridge just west of campus a few hours later, according to deputies and university officials. They say he fell more than 20 feet from a state highway bridge over the Seneca River to the shallow water below.

Oconee 
County deputies said Wednesday that there is no evidence Tucker Hipps' 
death was a result of hazing, but they are still trying to piece 
together what happened. 

However, The Tiger News
 reports that a representative from the national office of Hipps' 
fraternity, Sigma Phi Epsilon, came to campus to investigate the hazing 
claims.

Officials haven't found anyone who saw him fall Monday, sheriff's office spokesman Jimmy Watt said.

On Tuesday, the university enacted a ban on social activities for all 24 fraternities on campus. In a statement, Vice President for Student Affairs Gail DiSabatino cited reports of possible criminal activities and violations of the university's code of conduct - ranging from alcohol-related medical emergencies to sexual misconduct - for the move.

DiSabatino called Hipps' death tragic but did not say it was responsible for or related to the ban.

The suspension is intended to give fraternities time to work with other student and campus organizations to make sure members stay safe, university spokesman John Gouch said.

"They didn't want to put a deadline on it because they wanted to give everyone plenty of time to think," Gouch said. Clemson placed similar restrictions on Greek organizations four years ago, also after allegations of criminal activities

Students organized an impromptu vigil for Hipps on Tuesday, raising cellphones above their heads instead of candles. University President Jim Clements joined the remembrance and said everyone who knew Hipps called him a leader and a good man.

Detectives have interviewed about 50 people so far, including the fraternity members running with Hipps who have been cooperative, Watt said.

"We haven't talked to anyone who saw him fall," Watt said. "We don't know why he ended up in the water."

The national Sigma Phi Epsilon organization said in a statement that if foul play was involved in Hipps' death, it would make sure those responsible are brought to justice.

A statement from the college added that the sheriff's office is investigating Hipps' death.

'We are cooperating and also conducting our own investigation,' DiSabatino said. 'We're terribly saddened by Tucker's death. It's always tragic when someone so young and promising is lost. Our hearts go out to his family and friends.'

Students have been provided with grief counseling services.

After Hipps did not appear at breakfast friends went searching for him, and his body was finally discovered that afternoon in a lake

A roundup of recent Clemson student legal troubles at Jezebel notes that six undergrads were arrested on felony drug charges in April in a sting operation authorities called 'Spring Tiger.'

According to The Tiger News those students were charged with a variety of crimes related to the sale or possession of marijuana and psilocybin mushrooms.  

The reports did not specify whether those charged had fraternity connections.

The university placed similar restrictions on Greek organizations four years ago.
