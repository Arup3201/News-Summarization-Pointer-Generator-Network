Whitey Bulger has revealed that he relishes his years spent on the run and says that those memories are the ones helping him through his latest prison sentence.

The notorious Boston gangster was sentenced to spend life in prison plus up to 30 years after being found guilty on racketeering and extortion counts from his days as the head of the Winter Hill Gang.

Now he is using that time in jail to formulate his own narrative, writing a letter from his prison cell where he tells how he wishes things were different for himself- and for his longtime girlfriend, Catherine Greig.

Better days: Whitey Bulger wrote in a recent letter from prison that the 16 years he spent on the run with his girlfriend Catherine Greig were the best of his life (pictured together here in an undated photo)

Spotted: Greig and Bulger were captured in 2011 in their then-apartment in Santa Monica, California

'My 16 years on the run were the happiest years of my life and hers. Memories sustain me,' he wrote in the letter.

Captive man: Whitey Bulger, 83, was sentenced to life in prison with up to 30 additional years behind bars

'If I met Catherine at a younger age I would have had a better life. She was the best thing that ever happened to me.'

Greig began dating Bulger sometime in the 1970s and lived together in Boston before they went on the run in 1995.

After being caught by authorities by Bulger's side in their adopted apartment in Santa Monica, California in 2011, she was recently tried and found guilty of harboring a fugitive. She is now serving an eight-year prison sentence.

Bulger does not appear to be settling for his life sentence, as he writes that he is 'getting things together for appeal'.

'Jail and prisons are a dead end,' he said in the letter obtained by Radar.com. It is unclear who the intended recipient was meant to be.

'I expect the worst is yet to come — I’ll deal with it and welcome the "peace,"' the 83-year-old convict wrote.

'Will be busy but will write you again later on — You could do me a favor. Stay out of trouble and avoid entanglement in this. Meet a nice girl and enjoy life + appreciate freedom.'

In another jailhouse letter, Bulger wrote how he finds Greig has been inappropriately sentenced, as her eight years is a larger sentence than many of the fellow mobsters who testified against him in trial.

Writing that ‘her sentence is a crime,’ Mr Bulger said, signing the letter 'Inmate No. 1428AZ,' the same prisoner number he was issued during his early 1960s stay at Alcatraz.

Traveling man: Bulger, seen here in an undated photo that was shown at his trial, was on the run from about 1995 to 2011 but now he will spend the rest of his life behind bars

Earlier days: In his latest letter, Bulger said that the years on the run- and not the ones when he was working his way up to be Boston's biggest mob boss- were his favorite

‘More time + fine than people who confessed to murder and made deal to testify against me for the gov and in return set free after short sentence. They told the gov what it wanted to hear and were rewarded.'

Of the former Winter Hill gang henchmen Mr Bulger is referring to, one is likely Stephen ‘The Rifleman’ Flemmi – a confessed murderer who pulled his victims’ teeth out to prevent identification, had a sexual relationship with his stepdaughter and lured her to a home where Mr Bulger allegedly strangled her to death, according to his testimony during Bulger’s long-awaited trial.
