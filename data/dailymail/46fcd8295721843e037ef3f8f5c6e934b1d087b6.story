Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson and boxer Amir Khan starred in a short video in their roles as ambassadors of Maxi Nutrition. 

Henderson quizzed Khan on the details of his career, training techniques, fitness and strict diet. 

And when Khan was probed as to who he would most like to fight, he told Henderson 'Floyd Mayweather.'

Elsewhere, in an interview with Liverpool's official magazine, Henderson admitted that he is not getting complacent over inheriting the club captaincy from the departing Steven Gerrard. 

Although he is widely considered the favourite to take on the role, given that he has already captained the side in Gerrard's absence through injury, the England star is keeping his feet on the ground.  

'Next season we'll see what happens because it might not be me succeeding Stevie, it might be someone else,' Henderson said. 

 'There are a lot of strong leaders in the dressing room. There are a lot of big characters in the team - down-to-earth, humble people.'

He suggested that there were plenty of other suitable candidates to be considered for the captaincy. 

'Mama (Sakho), Emre (Can) and Skerts (Martin Skrtel) have developed a strong collective understanding. You can see their passion, they're desperate to win, they give everything.

'Studge (Daniel Sturridge) is a big character. Lucas (Leiva) is too. I can only do the current job the best I can.'

Henderson joined Liverpool from Sunderland in 2011 for a reported £20 million fee and has since gone on to become a mainstay in their first-team.
