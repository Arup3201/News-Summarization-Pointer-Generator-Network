The Empire State Building's lighting crew has tackled Halloween, Thanksgiving, the Fourth of July and even Alicia Keyes, but it has never attempted to perform one of its mesmerizing light shows for a Christmas audience - until now.

Friday marked the first of several Christmas light shows at New York's most recognizable building, and people from Williamsburg to Hoboken watched in awe as the iconic landmark sparkled with red, white and green LED lights powerful enough to light up the sky.

The lights flash, change color and flicker - all while set to music that can be heard on a radio station throughout the city.

'Synchronizing the Empire State Building's incredible LED lights with 
Lite fm's Christmas music is our early holiday gift for all New 
Yorkers,' Tom Poleman, president of national programming platforms 
for Clear Channel, which owns the radio station 106.7 Lite FM, on which the synchronized music can be heard, tells Today.com.

The light show uses the building's Philips Color Kinetics LED lighting system that was installed in 2012 to replace the traditional incandescent lights that previously lit the building.

Holidays: Since the new lights were installed, the building has performed light shows for the Fourth of July, Halloween and Thanksgiving

Building officials say the best spots to view the shows are near the Brooklyn Bridge, Bryant Park, The Highline, Hoboken/Jersey City 
Waterfront, Hudson River Esplanade, Long Island City, Madison Square 
Park, Tribeca Park, Union Square, Jackson Square, and the Williamsburg 
Waterfront.

The shows will run every night at 7 p.m. until Christmas Eve, when there will be a special 'grand finale' show to ring in the holiday.
