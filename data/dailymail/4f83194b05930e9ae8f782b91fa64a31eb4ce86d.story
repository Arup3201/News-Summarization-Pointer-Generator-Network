Former RAF pilot Alistair Mathie, 67, who was killed when he walked into the spinning propeller of an aircraft

A former RAF pilot who died after walking into an aircraft's propeller could not hear the blades spinning because he was deafened by his headset, an accident report has claimed.

Alistair Mathie, 67, a former fighter pilot, had just landed the Piper J3C-65 Cub at an 
airstrip when he had a 'momentary lapse in concentration' and walked 
into the revolving blades.

He was killed instantly after suffering a severe head injury and pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.

He was said to be the 'best of the best' in the flying world and was known all over the globe.

The incident happened shortly after 3pm on January 28 after the flying instructor touched down at Priory Farm air strip in Norfolk during a lesson to allow a student to take the controls.

A report by the Air Accident 
Investigation Bureau (AAIB) has revealed Mr Mathie was wearing his 
headset at the time of the accident and may not have heard the engine.

The AAIB found the wind produced by 
the working engine when the aircraft was stationary was not particularly
strong and Mr Mathie may not have felt it.

Experts also believe he may not have 
seen the propeller because, as although the tips of the blades had 
different colours, the hues may not have been visible to him.

A post-mortem report found the 
injuries Mr Mathie, from Burgate, Norfolk, sustained were consistent 
with him having had his head down at the time of the accident, when he 
was struck once on the head.

He had no medical conditions which could have contributed to the accident, the report found.

Mr Mathie lived in a large farmhouse in 
Burgate with his wife Dorothy who is also a pilot and who he taught to fly. He was born
in India before moving to the UK to pursue a career in the RAF.

He was a former fighter pilot who flew Jaguar fighter jets before becoming an airline pilot for Thomas Cook.

The AAIB did not recommend any specific safety improvements, but the Light Aircraft Association (LAA) is set to broaden its training.

The LAA, which qualified Mr Mathie as a coach, plans to include the dangers posed by propellers when boarding or leaving the aircraft in future training.

The AAIB report also stated the accident illustrated the value of a procedure used by some pilots of following a path along the edge of the wing when approaching or leaving the aircraft to ensure safe clearance from the rotating propeller.

The possibility of turning off the engine in between flights was also considered.

However, the Piper Cub’s engine has to be started by hand, which can be equally as hazardous as leaving the engine running, especially if hot after recent use.

Tragic: Mr Mathie pictured in his RAF days when he flew Jaguar fighter jets

Speaking at the time of his death Peter Gill, 67, secretary of the International Auster Club said Alistair Mathie, 67, was 'the best of the best' in the flying world.

He said: 'I cannot believe what has happened. I am gutted.

'Al was a highly skilled pilot. He was the best of the best.

'If you were going to fly with somebody he was the man you would choose.

'He was very well respected all over the world - I have received tributes from Brazil, South America, Australia and New Zealand from people who knew Al.

'Al taught his wife Dot to fly. they keep their own Auster plane on their farm - it was Al’s pride and joy.

'I know what happened but I am puzzled by it. If Al was on an air field and saw somebody doing something wrong he would be the first to tell them.

Speaking at the time of his death life-long friend Al Couts paid tribute to the hero saying he was a true gent.

He had just landed a Piper J3C-65 Cub, similar to the one pictured, at an airstrip when the accident happened

Posting a message on a pilot forum he said: 'I've known Al for a very long time, we were in the RAF together in the early eighties.

'I think of him and Dot as friends - about once a year he or they fly in and we have countless cups of tea and I tease out his great stories.

'I've learnt a lot from him, saw him as a mentor never a peer and thoroughly enjoyed his company and his willingness to help.'

Robert Sage, who owns the airfield, paid tribute to Alistair saying he was a 'selfless' and 'popular' man.

He said: 'He is one of the most experience pilots I know - he flew Jaguar fighter jets in the RAF so we are still in disbelief as to how this happened.

'He kept planes on his own private air strip and was just here to help out.'

Figures have showed that since 1991 there had 
been 15 accidents involving light aircraft, 10 of which occurred while 
trying to start the engine by hand swinging the propeller and five when 
passengers or ground personnel were hit by rotating propellers.
