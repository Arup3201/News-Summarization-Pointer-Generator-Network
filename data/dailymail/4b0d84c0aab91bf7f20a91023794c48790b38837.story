A woman has spoken of her shock after she was attacked by a fox in broad daylight in the middle of London.

Nanny Kirsty Poole recounted how she was trying to take a picture of the animal because she thought it was 'cute'.

But the vermin ran at her and bit into her Ugg boot, which it seems to have mistaken for another animal.

Ms Poole, 31, had just got off the Tube in Putney when she was surprised to see the bold fox walking around in broad daylight.

She told the Evening Standard: 'I saw this fox, and I thought, "How cute", and took a picture with my phone.

'It ran towards me and bit straight into my Ugg boot. I was really shocked that it bit in so hard.

'I had to fight to get it away and I suppose it stopped biting when it realised the boot wasn't food.

'Luckily it didn't get to my skin because the boot was so thick.'

Eventually Ms Poole managed to shoo the animal away, and it started running after another passer-by instead.

She told the Standard she partly blamed herself for stopping to take the fox's photo, but also reflected on her bad luck for wearing footwear which looks so much like a fox or other type of animal.

The nanny said she was shaken up by the incident, which she will report to the local council in an effort to help others avoid a similar situation.

Ms Poole plans to buy a new pair of the £85 boots, joking: 'I don't think it looks very good to have a fox bite on the front of your shoe.'

Wildlife expert John Bryant said that foxes rarely attack humans, and suggested that it might have thought that the boot was either an attacker or prey.

'It might have thought that the furry-looking boots were an animal or animals attacking,' he said. 'I could guess that it may have felt it was under attack.'

Ms Poole's ordeal is one of a string of recent incidents where foxes showed aggression towards people.

Over the weekend, a fox was filmed trying to drag a three-year-old boy away while he was sledging in his garden.
