The most feared puncher in boxing added a flash of menace to one of London's most regal streets on Thursday afternoon.

Gennady Golovkin, the Kazakh wrecking ball with a knockout percentage touching 90 per cent, met St Helens' Martin Murray on a fleeting visit to Regent Street.

The next time the middleweights come together will be two months hence in the equally glittering setting of Monte Carlo.

Even the father of Princess Charlene of Monaco took his place at the top table.

Golovkin, whose arrival was delayed by two days due to visa issues, smiled a boyish grin that belies his devastating power.

The world champion, who has stopped his last 18 opponents, said: 'I am really happy to have a big fight with Martin.

'I respect him, he's a great fighter. I have a lot of time until February 21.

'Martin is very strong, I think he's my best opponent. He's the biggest challenger for me.

'He has style and more boxing class.'

Murray, in his third world title fight, insisted he can do what 31 men before him have failed to on his third visit to the principality.

He said: 'I'm looking forward to the challenge. It's a tough fight but with it comes great reward.

'I think his last opponents were already beaten when they went in but I'm confident I'll win.

'He possesses great power but on my day I have the tools to beat any middleweight in the world.

'I think my versatility will win me this fight.'
