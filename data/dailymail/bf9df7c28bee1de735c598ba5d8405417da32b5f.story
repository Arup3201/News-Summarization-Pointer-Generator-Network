The competition between the two British TV stations covering the World Cup will be as fierce as any on the pitch.

Both have invested in big names and foreign stars to try to give viewers the best insight into the biggest tournament on the planet.

Here, Sportsmail assesses the two sides and give our verdict on who will do it best in Brazil...

BBC’s Gary Lineker is suave and sophisticated. He has a slick line in patter of which his old mentor Des Lynam would approve. Lineker’s 10 goals in two World Cup finals make him as qualified as any of his studio experts to pass judgment. ITV’s Adrian Chiles is not everyone’s cup of tea, but he does a decent job of stirring up his studio guests. He certainly transmits the sense that he knows what it’s like to be an England fan.

Verdict: BBC by a mile

Winning team: The BBC, led by Gary Lineker (centre), have some formidable pundits

BBC boast Thierry Henry, Clarence Seedorf, Rio Ferdinand, Alan Hansen, Juninho, Alan Shearer, Danny Murphy, Phil Neville, Neil Lennon, Robbie Savage and Sportsmail’s Martin Keown among their team.

ITV have lost Roy Keane but include Patrick Vieira, Ian Wright, Lee Dixon, Gus Poyet, Gordon Strachan, Andros Townsend, Glenn Hoddle, Fabio Cannavaro, Martin O’Neill — and a possible deal for John Terry will help them compete.

Verdict: BBC edge it

Anchorman role: Adrian Chiles will front ITV's coverage but losing Roy Keane (below) is a huge blow

BBC have England’s opener against Italy, but kick off their coverage with the June 13 clash between 2010 finalists Spain and Holland. The Beeb’s 31 matches include the last 16 game if Roy Hodgson’s men make it through.

ITV have England’s other two group games against Uruguay and Costa Rica. ITV’s 34 matches kick off with Brazil v Croatia.

Verdict: A score-draw

In the knockout stages the BBC gets first pick of the round of 16 and semi-finals while ITV will take the first pick of the quarter-finals. Both the BBC and ITV will broadcast the final live.
