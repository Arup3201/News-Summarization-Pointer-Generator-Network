A self-confessed 'bad boy' is today preparing to donate one of his kidneys to save the life of a complete stranger to make up for all the wrong he has done in his life.

Wesley Joyce, 32, will become an organ donor after being touched by 34-year-old Sally-Anne Grainger who has cystic fibrosis.

The pub landlord came forward after hearing the mother-of-two's desperately plea for help in April.

Ms Grainger went into renal failure after having to take strong medication following a double lung transplant in March 2009.

Following her first transplant Ms Grainger said she had been 
given a second lease of life.

But since her kidneys started to fail, the student has been forced to have dialysis treatment three times a week, leaving her 'barely existing'.

She is also anaemic and gets easily exhausted, which is impacting negatively on her university work.

She pleaded for a donor to come forward, wanting to extend her life to spend as much time as possible with her daughters Kelsey, 14, and Megan, 10.

In 2009 the mother-of-two had a double lung transplant and is now preparing to go under the knife for the life-saving operation after doctors gave the transplant the go-ahead.

Mr Joyce, a former soldier, said giving Ms Grainger the 'gift of life' to change his ways after a checkered past.

The father-of-four, from Worcester, said: 'When I was younger the dad of a lad I went to school with took me to the Wolves ground.

'He had a heart and lung transplant and I thought if he hadn't, he wouldn't have known me and I wouldn't be the person I am today.

'I looked at her story and it got to me a bit. I looked at her children and I could not imagine the mums of my children not being there for them.

'I thought, "I need to change my life a little bit" as I’ve not been a good boy all my life.

'I’ve done good things and bad things but I thought, let’s do good from now on.

'This is a good place to start. Let’s save someone’s life.'

Mr Wesley told how he had turned his life around after being jailed for four years for grievous bodily harm in 2004.

He said: 'When I was about 21 and 22 I was a bit of a bad boy. I was mischievous to say the least.

'I was always getting drunk and fighting and getting into trouble with the police. I was pretty violent and a bit of a rogue.

'Then I got jailed for a Section 18 disorder and spent time at Blakenhurst prison where I vowed never to go back. I hurt somebody very badly, that's all I'll say about that,

'I was out in two years for good behaviour and wanted to get my life back on track and then I saw the story about Sally-Anne.

'I wanted to prove that despite chequered pasts there is always a light at the end of the tunnel if you want there to be.

'I didn't want to get caught on that slippery slope and hope I am really proof that bad guys can turn good.'

Mr Joyce had to undergo a series of tests to check if he was suitable to be a donor for Ms Grainger.

When results revealed he was the perfect match, doctors asked him whether he wanted to go ahead with the two-hour operation.

Cystic fibrosis is a life-shortening inherited disease, affecting more than 10,000 people in the UK.

It is not a condition a person can catch, those diagnosed with the disease are born with it.

It is inherited and caused by a faulty gene, which controls the movement of salt and water in and out of the cells in a person's body.

The lungs and digestive system become clogged with mucus, making it hard to breathe and digest food.

More than 2.5million people in the UK carry the faulty gene, around one in 25 of the population.

There is currently no cure for cystic fibrosis but many treatments exist to help manage symptoms, including physiotherapy, exercise, medication and nutrition.

HOwever in more severe cases, sufferers will go on to require a lung transplant.

He added: 'I’m not letting anyone down. I’m saving this woman’s life.

'I’m nervous but I’m not nervous for me, You’ve got one life so live it the best you can.

'I believe what will be will be. I’ve lived my life. I’ve done everything I need to do and I’ve got four beautiful children.

'It’s time for me to let someone else live her life. I can’t have this lady’s children losing their mum.

'When I went for my scans, my 15-year-old messaged me and said I’m so proud of you for what you are going through and what you are doing.

'That’s all I need and to see a smile on Sally-Anne’s face when it’s all over.

'To know that her children are growing up with their mother and I’ve had a little help towards that.

'I just want to meet her now to say I’m going to do my best for you and I’m not going to let you down. I will do everything I physically can to help you.

'Life’s too short and I’m not having someone die at 34 - not if I can help it.'

Ms Grainger told of her delight at finding a match, and is set to undergo the operation at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital in the next few months.

The 34-year-old, who lives three mimles from Mr Joyce, in Wardon Villages, Worcestershire, said he was giving her the 'gift of life'.

'It was amazing to be told they had found a match - I couldn’t believe it,' she said.

Miss Grainger today thanked Mr Joyce - saying 'It will mean I can live a normal life and be a mum to my girls'

'I really cannot thank them enough for their selfless gift.

'I’m buzzing but I am trying not to get too over excited after what happened before but I want to stay positive.

'If I have it in August I am determined to be back at university again.

'It will mean I can live a normal life and be a mum to my girls for as long as possible.'
