Hutain who is a photographer says he's also 'found himself in the LED stick figure costume business,' following last year’s success and that while the new glow suit isn't for sale yet, they will be sometime in the future on his website Glowyzoey.com.

For now, viewers can enjoy precious footage of his daughter who he calls, Glowy Zoey, as light up-Minnie Mouse illuminating cuteness in a dark room.

Not only can Zoey light up any dim space, she can also change the color of her LEDs by making a loud sound.

Twisted Sifter reports that the 2014 version of the costume had the LED strips hooked up to an Arduino microcontroller.

The microcontroller is responsive to sound and has a button in the back of one of the ears along with two potentiometers and a microphone in the front of the costume.

The outfit has 372 LEDS and 12 different modes.

The vibrant costume is a hit with kids and parents alike as it's a sure-fire way to spot one's child in a crowd of costumed trick-or-treaters.

Grown-ups who have an inner child shining from within can also sport it on the outside with the adult stick figure version of Glowy Zoey.

Sudden success: Royce Hutain  made the stick figure suit for his daughter Zoey last year just for fun but says he 'got into the LED costume business' following his creation's mass success

Fun that glows: The LED suit is enjoyable for children especially those who may be afraid of the dark 

Minnie Mouse: Zoey's LED costume is made to look like Minnie Mouse, a popular Disney character
