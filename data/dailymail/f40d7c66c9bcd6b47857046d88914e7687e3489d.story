The final of the Invitational Darts Tournament in Melbourne was halted for after a riot broke out among members of the crowd.

The match which saw Michael van Gerwen comeback from 5-1 and 8-4 deficits before eventually triumphing over Australian Simon Whitlock 9-8, was stopped for a period of time as officials attempted to restore some order about the Etihad Stadium.

Chairs were thrown and tables were overturned as spectators ran amok at the tournament which is in its third year.

People were understood to be jumping on the tables until they broke in half and some were body slamming other crowd members.

Security guards tried and failed to defuse the situation, before dozens of riot police entered the stadium.

It is unclear how long play was suspended for or why supporters were rioting. One spectators, 19-year-old Joel Yeowart, who was in the crowd at the Etihad Stadium told Melbourne based newspaper,The Herald Sun that the chaos had started when 'a small group of people started chucking chairs at each other. 

Another spectator, 25-year-old William Cook, said that hundreds of people started throwing chairs and tables during the final game and saw one man urinate on the ground. 'It was a total disaster,' he said, 'It was crazy, it just built up so fast.' 

Another eyewitness who traveled to Melbourne from Sydney especially for the tournament told www.theage.com.au he was shocked and disgusted at the scenes.

'It was an absolute mess, drunken idiots that were getting bored and looking for a bit of excitement.

'It was like a proper riot mentality. The security guards couldn't get a handle on it, it was a real uphill battle for them.'

The eyewitness said when the match eventually concluded, Van Gerwen seemed unimpressed with what had gone on in the crowd.

He added: 'The look on his face after he won, it was a look not of victory, but one of pure disgust.

'I've never seen anything like it. It wasn't good for the sport, it wasn't good for the city's image. I thought it was terrible.'
