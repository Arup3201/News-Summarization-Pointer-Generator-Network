Roy Keane's and Sir Alex Ferguson's frosty relationship doesn't appear to have melted after the duo blanked each on a flight home from Paris to Manchester on Wednesday afternoon.

The pair both boarded the flight AF1068, departing from Charles de Gaulle airport at 12.55pm, but failed to acknowledge each other throughout the duration of the one-hour-or-so journey.

Keane and Ferguson had both been in the French capital to watch Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League last 16 first leg 1-1 draw at home to Chelsea on Tuesday night.

Keane had attended the Parc des Princes clash as a pundit for ITV's coverage of the match, while Ferguson was in the stands watching as part of his work with UEFA.

According to the Guardian, Keane sat impassively by the window with former United team-mate, and ITV pundit, Paul Scholes on one side as Ferguson sat three rows back on the other.

The publication notes that Ferguson was the first to board the plane with his wife Cathy.

As Keane eventually took his seat, it is reported that Mrs Ferguson gave her husband a nudge to indicate who had walked past.

But instead of greeting him, it adds that 'Ferguson took one look, narrowed his eyes and then lifted up his newspaper to continue reading the sports pages.'

The hostile atmosphere is the latest episode in the two's long-standing feud since Keane sensationally left Manchester United in 2005.

Both Keane and Ferguson have reported their version of events differently at how the former left the Old Trafford outfit in subsequent well-documented autobiographies - to the disdain of each.

Prior to that the pair enjoyed a trophy-laden 12-and-a-half-seasons period as manager and player at Manchester United which included seven Premier League titles, four FA Cups and a Champions League crown.
