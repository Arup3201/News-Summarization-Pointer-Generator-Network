A 'superfan' of  Charles Manson appears to have carried out her vow to marry the 80-year-old notorious mass murderer.

Afton Elaine Burton, who calls herself Star, was spotted outside her home on Saturday proudly flaunting a new ring on her wedding finger.

The 26-year-old has been writing to the killer since she was a teen and even moved from her home in Illinois to the California town where he is imprisoned.

Newlywed? Charles Manson's girlfriend Afton Elaine Burton was seen outside her Corcoran, California home on Saturday wearing a band on her ring finger, suggesting the couple had tied the knot

May-December: Burton, who goes by the name 'Star', first met Manson as a teen when she started writing to him behind bars. She moved to Corcoran, California at the age of 18 to be nearer to him 

The couple filed for a marriage license on November 7, which gave them just 90 days to carry out the nuptials. Calls to the California State Prison were not immediately returned Sunday morning. 

California Department of Corrections spokesman Jeffrey Callison previously stated that the wedding would have to take place on a visiting day, which happen on Saturdays, Sundays and certain holidays (including Thanksgiving).

Callison said the couple would be allowed 10 guests from outside the prison, two guests from inside the prison and an officiant of their own choosing.

However, the two are not be allowed to consummate their marriage since Manson's life in prison sentence bans him from receiving conjugal visits.

In previous interviews, Star gushed about falling in love with Manson and his 'philosophy' as a teen, and how she already considered herself married to him.

Behind bars: Manson has spent the last four decades in prison after being found guilty of participating in seven murders in 1969 

'I'm completely with him, and he's completely with me. It's what I was born for, you know. I don't know what else to say,' she told CNN in August.

Manson has been in prison for the last four decades, after he and four disciples of his doomsday cult carried out a series of murders in 1969.

One of their victims was Roman Polanski's actress wife Sharon Tate, who was butchered to death in her upscale southern California home when she was eight and a half months pregnant.

Manson and his disciples were initially sentenced to death, but later had those sentences commuted to life in prison.

In 2012, he applied and was denied parole, and cannot apply again until 2027 which means the couple have little chance of living together in matrimony.

Manson has been married twice before, first to Rosalie Jean Willis from 1955 to 1958 and then to Candy Stevens from 1959 to 1963.

Star has also been compared to one of Manson's disciples Susan Atkins, known as 'Sexy Sadie', who was also convicted of participating in eight of the August 1969 killings.

Manson and his 'Family' of disciples carried out a series of murders in August 1969, which they thought would bring about a 'Helter Skelter' race war.

The murders were centered on affluent Los Angeles neighborhoods, which they tried to pin on African American.

Not ok: Star's father Phil Burton (pictured) previously spoke out to MailOnline to say he does not approve of the marriage and will not be attending the jailhouse ceremony 

Star's father Phil Burton spoke exclusively with MailOnline in July, to describe the moment his daughter called to announce her engagement.

'Daddy I'm getting married to Charlie,' Star gushed to her 45-year-old father.

Mr Burton, of Bunker Hill, Illinois, said that while he loves his daughter, he would not be attending her wedding and does not support her relationship with Manson.

‘We have not, we are not going to and we never will, no matter what she does in her life, disown our daughter. I love my kids more than life itself. I love my daughter, my wife loves my daughter and I know she still loves us,' Mr Burton told MailOnline.

Mr Burton revealed that his daughter first discovered Manson in high school, when a friend profiled the mass-murderer for a school project.

‘This particular friend of hers got hold of a lot of pro Manson literature. She’s a kid. She didn’t dig. She didn’t research. She’s just wanting to do her paper. And it had a lot to do with what he’s doing now with ATWA (Air Trees Water Animals and All the Way Alive),' Mr Burton said.

Mr Burton says his young daughter was drawn to ATWA and its naturalistic ideals, which led her to first reach out to Manson through letters.

However, Mr Burton says he was not aware of his daughter's first contact with Manson, and would have stopped the correspondence had he known. 

‘If I could have shut it down when it started, of course I would have. But we couldn’t. She was already 18 by the time we found out,' he said.

Mr Burton also revealed his opinion about Manson, who he has spoken to over the phone.

‘I’ve talked with him and I don’t mean this as an insult, it’s an observation, I think maybe there’s been a bit of Napoleon syndrome over the years. He’s not a tall man and perhaps he’s made up for that by becoming this big personality,' he said.

While Mr Bruton is troubled by his daughter's fascination with Manson, he says he is comforted by the fact that Manson will be behind bars for their marriage.

‘It’s never going to be able to come to fruition. It’s never going to develop into a full blown relationship and I think that may be a part of what eases me a little as a parent,' he said.
