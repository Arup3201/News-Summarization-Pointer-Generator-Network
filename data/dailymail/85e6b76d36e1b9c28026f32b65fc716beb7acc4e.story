India has unveiled a massive military spending plan that will see it splash out more than £10billion on a fleet of new warships and submarines.

The country, which has received £1.6billion in aid from Britain in the past eight years, will bolster its navy by building seven frigates at a cost of £5.2billion.

A further £5.2billion will be spent on six nuclear-powered submarines.

The defence plans follow the successful launch of a rocket capable of manned space flight at an estimated cost of £250million.

Britain is stopping its handouts, totalling around £210million this year, from the end of this December. But many more millions will head towards Delhi in the form of private sector expertise and technical assistance.

India’s government has cleared the plan to build its most advanced warships only months after making its order for new submarines in October.

The orders are part of a plan to try to close the gap with the Chinese navy in the Indian Ocean.

Since taking over last year, prime minister Narendra Modi has signalled his resolve to build a strong military following claims the country would be unable to fight a two-front war against China and Pakistan.

The decision to bolster India’s navy comes after it has been rattled in recent months by the presence of Chinese submarines docked in Sri Lanka, just off its southern coast. 

The Indian frigates, which are being made in a programme called Project-17A, will be built at the government shipyards in Mumbai and Kolkata.

There has been growing anger from Tory backbenchers over spending on Britain’s aid budget at a time when public services are being slashed in the UK.

Tory MP Peter Bone said last night: ‘This is why we should not be giving any aid to India. It was not aid that brought India out of poverty but trade. Aid is just a sticking plaster.’ Andrew Rosindell, Tory MP for Romford, said: ‘It is clear that India is becoming a wealthy country if it is able to spend such a colossal amount on its military.

‘There is absolutely no justification for Dfid [the Department for International Development] to now be spending any money on India.

‘It’s a pity it’s taken this long to put a stop to it, but at least the decision has now been taken.’

In 2012 the Government announced the current eight-year £1.6billion aid package running until the end of this year would be the last. The amount of aid to India will reduce to £35.1million by 2016/2017.

The decision came after India’s finance minister Pranab Mukherjee told the Indian parliament: ‘We do not require the aid. It is a peanut in our total development spending.’

Justine Greening, the International Development Secretary, said: ‘It is time to recognise India’s changing place in the world.

‘After reviewing the programme and holding discussions with the government of India, we agreed that now is the time to move to a relationship focusing on skill sharing rather than aid.’

In reply, India’s foreign minister, Salman Khurshid, said: ‘Aid is the past and trade is the future.’

Earlier this month, a major report warned that Britain’s foreign aid budget has been increased so quickly that ministers and officials were ‘struggling’ to spend it properly.

It found that they were ‘unprepared’ for the challenge of spending a 30 per cent increase in the budget last year.

The increase followed David Cameron’s controversial pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of the UK’s income on foreign aid.

In a devastating conclusion, the Independent Commission for Aid Impact said there was only ‘limited evidence’ that the money made a real difference in the world’s poorest countries. In some cases it may even have made problems worse.
