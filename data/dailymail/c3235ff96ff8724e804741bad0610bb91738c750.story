After years of being overweight, grandmother Marcia Thomas, 53, from East Grinstead, was thrilled when she managed to shed 7st courtesy of a healthy diet and plenty of exercise.

But despite spending hours in the gym trying to tone her upper arms, they remained stubbornly flabby.

At her wits end, Marcia decided to pay for surgery in Belgium to remove the unsightly bingo wings - and was left devastated when she discovered that not only had the bungling surgeon failed to remove any flab; he'd left her arms badly scarred to boot.

Not right: Marcia was horrified to discover that no fat had been removed following her Â£3,500 surgery

Now she has spoken out about her experience of surgery abroad and says she wishes she had never been tempted by the cut-price deals available.

'I'm really angry with the surgeon and I
 wish I hadn't had the surgery,' she admits. 'I can't even bear to look at my arms - I
 feel like a freak!'

Marcia's story began when she decided to break the habit of a lifetime and embrace healthy eating in a bid to lose weight.

Originally tipping the scales at a hefty 16st, she slowly but surely managed to lose seven through diet and exercise and says she was thrilled with the results.

'I felt great for it - I looked good as well,' she reveals. 'My clothes looked good on me and the only downside of it was the skin on my arms.'

Ouch: She had surgery to remove pouches of skin left after weight loss but was upset to find them still there

While the rest of her had become taut and toned, the skin on her arms had stretched and lost elasticity, leaving her with pouches of wobbly skin.

''I'd always have to buy a size larger in jackets just so my arms could fit in,' she remembers. 'I wanted to feel feminine and I wanted to look feminine.'

Convinced that no amount of gym-going would fix the problem, she travelled to the Belgian capital Brussels for surgery to remove her bingo wings at a cost of Â£3,500.

'It was a very, very nice clinic,' she remembers. 'The 
doctor told me what he was going to do and said he was used to working 
on women of colour so I felt really calm.'

When she emerged from surgery, she was horrified by the results. 'I had the scarring to prove that I'd 
had this surgery but the actual size of my arms still looked the same,' she reveals.

'I
 was told by the surgeon that that was normal and I wouldn't see any 
difference for a few weeks.'

Relief: Marcia has since had further surgery which saw medics remove a whopping 250g of fat from her arms

Four months later, she was still waiting to see results - much to the horror of British consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon, Peter Arnstein.

'She has had no recourse to further 
opinion and back-up on her trip to Belgium and for me, that's just 
unforgiveable,' he says. 'For a patient to be left adrift is just unacceptable.'

Dr Arnstein has since helped Marcia put her botched body right, courtesy of a two-hour operation which involved removing 250g of fat - all of which should have already been removed by the bungling Belgian doctor.

Speaking after the surgery, a thrilled Marcia said it had helped her regain some of the confidence lost as a result of the botched surgery.

'I can wear feminine clothes now and I can show my arms with pride,' she adds. 'They look really good and I feel really, really good.'
