At 21, she was a talented English literature student with a bright future ahead of her.

He was a volatile 26-year-old electrician consumed with jealousy for his gifted girlfriend.

Yesterday an inquest heard how Katy Winchester was found strangled next to the body of Kurt Tyrrell, the boyfriend variously described as violent, possessive and controlling.

Tempestuous relationship: Katy Winchester with Kurt Tyrrell

At the time of the incident police said they believed he had killed Miss Winchester and then hanged himself.

Friends said the couple had ‘drifted apart’ while Miss Winchester was 100 miles away at Manchester Metropolitan University.

She was killed during a weekend visit to Tyrrell’s home in North Hykeham, Lincolnshire, just weeks before her finals.

Coroner Stuart Fisher heard that the pair were found dead in the 26-year-old’s locked bedroom last April.

Friends of the couple said Tyrrell – a ‘weekend binge drinker’ – had been both violent and unfaithful towards his girlfriend in the past.

Miss Winchester’s best friend, Natalie Watson, said that while the couple appeared normal on the surface, Tyrrell was ‘quite controlling and the jealous type’.

She added: ‘I didn’t think  they were 
going to be together forever. They had different views on life. They 
wanted to do  different things.’

The court heard that in 2010 Tyrrell 
took a job in Manchester to be closer to Miss Winchester. The couple 
split up in the autumn of that year but had reunited by that Christmas.

Miss Winchester’s semi-naked body was 
found by a paramedic who smashed open Tyrrell’s bedroom door with a 
sledgehammer after a 999 call from a housemate who had been unable to 
rouse the pair. Tyrrell was also found dead in the room.

The inquest heard the couple had spent the previous evening drinking with different groups of friends in Lincoln city centre before sharing a taxi for the five-mile journey back to the house.

Stuart Hall, one of Tyrrell’s housemates, said the pair had shared four bottles of vodka with another friend during ‘drinking games’ before heading off for their night out.

Mr Hall told the inquest when he arrived home at 3am he noticed what turned out to be blood on the floor of the house, but which he dismissed at the time as ketchup.

He saw Miss Winchester’s and her boyfriend’s shoes outside Tyrrell’s bedroom door and assumed they were inside, but raised the alarm when they had failed to appear by 5pm the next day.

Mr Hall said he noticed ‘the largest knife from our kitchen’ in the bedroom alongside the bloodied and bruised bodies.

Asked by Mr Fisher if it was correct to say the couple were drifting apart, Mr Hall replied: ‘Yes, they argued a lot.’

Mr Hall described the couple’s relationship as ‘tempestuous,’ adding,: ‘It was always on and off, one day he never wanted to see her again and the next he wanted to marry her.’

Another housemate, Oscar Campbell, said Tyrrell once admitted going ‘mad’ during a night out in Manchester, which culminated in him wrecking Miss Winchester’s bedroom.

Mr Campbell also said Tyrrell had once admitted his girlfriend ‘made him that mad he could kill her’, but dismissed the remark as a figure of speech.

He added: ‘Kurt had a bad temper but only when he’d had alcohol. I know he’d hit her a few times ... He was a weekend binge drinker. He would just flip and lose control of himself.’

A post-mortem examination revealed Miss Winchester died from compression to her neck and had also suffered two blows to her face.

Tyrrell died from ligature strangulation and also had superficial stab wounds.

The couple had booked a holiday in the Canary Islands for when Miss Winchester finished her studies, her father told the hearing.

But although Frank Winchester, 71, said they seemed happy together it was also apparent the pair ‘wanted different things’.

Mr Winchester, from Sleaford, said: ‘She was a very popular girl and had many friends.’

The couple were due to visit him on the day they were found dead.

The inquest continues.
