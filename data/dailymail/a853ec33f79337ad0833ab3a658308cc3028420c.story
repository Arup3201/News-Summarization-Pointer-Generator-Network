First things first: the selection of Jack Nowell on the wing is an excellent call by Stuart Lancaster. He’s been playing centre for Exeter and will bring a great deal of footballing nous into England’s back line.

To have three players in your back three who can play in any position is a massive advantage and England are getting stronger with every game. An in-form Nowell strengthens this team and Ireland coach Joe Schmidt would not have liked this change, which is great news! Jonny May would have been targeted in this game and Nowell’s positional play and greater defensive awareness should stand England in good stead against Ireland’s outstanding kicking game.

It’s a good, positive selection. But this game will not be won and lost out wide on the wing or between the No 10s — Jonny Sexton and George Ford — as many are saying. It will be won by the forwards.

The clash will not be won and lost out wide on the wing or between the No 10s, the pack will decide the game

Stuart Lancaster will have looked to his pack first and foremost - they are an under-rated group

When you get to the crunch games like this, any international coach will look to his pack first and foremost. You start by writing down the names of players No 1–8.

Much has been written about the England backs in this RBS 6 Nations but they can only play the way they have because of the performance of an under-rated England pack. They are not household names but they have every chance of becoming so.

What does it mean when people talk about winning the forward battle? How can one pack put pressure on another? Pressure can be created in many ways but the most important is the speed and intensity with which you operate.

I hope Lancaster has spent the week eyeballing his forwards. Here are six indicators to see who is winning the forward battle.

George Ford will hope that England's forwards can help him to an easier ride against the Irish on Sunday

THE SCRUM 

The nearer you get to World Cups, and the more important the games become, the more important the scrum becomes. If you don’t get it right you will lose. That is still the achilles heel of Australia and Wales, who are both in our World Cup group of death, and it will be a massive factor in this game.

In England’s first game against Wales they conceded a try from the first scrum. Yet when you looked at it objectively, England smashed them in that scrum. It was a massive moment because, while England conceded, they gained a huge psychological advantage, continued to dominate that area and went on to win the game.

Ben Youngs is key to disrupting Ireland's scrum, and needs to be all over Conor Murray at the base

England did not start well on the scoreboard but in the most important part of the game, they started brilliantly. England must look to disrupt at least a third of Ireland’s scrums and try to win 100 per cent on their own put-in.

By ‘disrupt’ I mean the opposition scrum-half finds it difficult to get the ball away from the base cleanly. I want to see Ben Youngs  all over Conor Murray at the base of the scrum.

England have a better front row and a better all-round pack of forwards, and they can gain the upper hand there. A dominant scrum will not allow the opposition to play how they want to.

Youngs will be an important part of England's efforts to disrupt at least a third of the opposition's scrums

THE LINE-OUT 

England must be looking to win at least 90 per cent of their own throw while disrupting 25 per cent of Ireland’s ball.

They must play with variety in the line-out, not just in terms of numbers but in terms of where they throw the ball, to get Ireland thinking. They need to be doing the unexpected and executing everything faster than the Irish team are accustomed to. This will create pressure.

Something we used to do - and if you watch the 2003 Grand Slam game vs Ireland you’ll see this - was delay kicking a penalty to touch until everybody knew the line-out call rather than making that call when everyone is assembled at the line-out. It meant that once the ball was in touch, everyone went quickly to the line-out.

Winning at least 90 per cent of their own throw is important  and England must show variety at line-outs

Ideally, the England support staff will be ready with a second ball. Do not assume the ballboys will give you a ball quickly because they will have been told to slow everything down (we did the same by the way!)

The hooker gets there as quick as he can and readies himself. The ball is thrown in immediately and you’re already playing quicker than the opposition can react.

Get the Irish out of their comfort zone. They will want it slow but a champion team wants it fast.

As hooker, Dylan Hartley will have to get to the line-outs as quickly as possible to throw in immediately

THE RESTARTS 

I recently reread my notes from before the 2003 game and one of the things we highlighted was the restarts. We identified two guys, Mike Tindall and Ben Cohen, who were outstandingly athletic and good in the air.

Every restart should be taken with the aim of winning the ball back, and with a kicker like Jonny Wilkinson we would look left, right or straight down the middle and use the accuracy of his kicks to give those great athletes a chance of reclaiming the ball. We want the ball so why just kick long?

England need to avoid kicking to Paul O’Connell from restarts because he is so strong receiving. Instead, they must look for Ireland’s weakest receivers.

BACK-ROW MOVES 

They seem to have vanished from the international game but they remain a vital weapon. Keep it simple and take the pressure off the backs by calling a back-row move.

This is as simple as No 8 picks up, runs, passes to the scrum-half who feeds the full back — England have great talent in the backs so just give them the ball early and let them play.

DROP GOALS 

Just like back-row moves, England seem to have forgotten the value of drop goals. Forwards love them because, even when defences are on top, they provide a means to keep the scoreboard ticking, which is a must, especially away from home.

Ireland’s defence is one of the best but they cannot defend a drop goal. It provides a massive lift and can be a real dagger to the opposition.

THE CONTACT AREA 

England need to bring some real pain to the contact area and let this Irish side know they are in a physical battle from the word go.

A great win of Lancaster’s, often forgotten, was the victory in Ireland two years ago. It is forgotten because England got hammered in Cardiff a few weeks later but in that win in Ireland, the England pack were awesome.

My favourite word at the moment is ‘grit’. Sheer, bloody grit will go a long way tomorrow. This England pack should relish the chance to show the world how tough they are. In forwards coach Graham Rowntree they have an excellent role model.

They must explode into the game and flood the breakdown with a minimum of three players in addition to the ball carrier in order to smash the opposition. It’s a strength of Ireland’s but I want to see England dominate them at the breakdown. I believe they can do that.

England need to go straight through the middle of the Irish breakdown as often as possible because it provides a massive psychological blow.

We used to call it ‘killer’ because of the damaging effect it had on opponents when they knew you had the physical and technical attributes required to just smash through them. It’s the ultimate pressure builder. If England can build pressure, they’ll win.

Ford and Sexton will have a big impact but whichever fly-half is given the easier ride will emerge victorious. Over to the forwards.

England’s pack will dominate this game - so they should win by five points.
