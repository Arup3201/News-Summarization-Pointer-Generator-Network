Brendan Rodgers believes Alberto Moreno will be a terrific signing for the club as the Sevilla defender finalises his switch to Anfield.

The Liverpool manager has been keen to add a left-back to his ranks all summer and believes the imminent arrival of Moreno is exciting news for the club.

He said: 'Moreno will be a terrific signing. He is nearly done now.'

Tears: Moreno said a tearful farewell to his Sevilla team-mates on Tuesday ahead of a move to Liverpool

Talented: Liverpool have been impressed enough by Moreno to splash out £12million on the left-back

Classy: Daniel Sturridge scored 26 goals in all competitions for Liverpool last season

Talent: Big things are expected of £9.8million signing Emre Can this season

Lethal: Raheem Sterling has been outstanding for club and country over the past year

Rodgers was also quick to insist that what happened last season, when Liverpool were pipped to the title by Manchester City in the final few games, is now firmly in the past as the Reds prepare for life without star man Luis Suarez.

He added: 'We are looking forward to the new season. We've had a really good pre-season and are really looking forward to the Southampton game. 

'They are a fantastic club and have been excellent since coming back. They have got some outstanding players. They will expect to do well. 

'We want to consolidate out place in the top four. There are maybe seven teams challenging for the top positions. But we will be ready. 

Moving on: Luis Suarez sealed a £75million transfer to Barcelona earlier this summer

'We are trying to make this a sustainable team. I see some odds with us not being in the top four. We are up there to be competitive. 

'We want to be up there again. We scored 101 goals last season.

'There is no change to what we will do. Whether we have lost our fear factor remains to be seen but there will be no change.There is nobody bigger than the club.'
