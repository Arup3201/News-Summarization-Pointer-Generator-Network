For more than half a century they shared the accolades as the greatest actors of their generation.

They first appeared on stage together in 1935 and were once photographed chummily arm in arm.

But behind the scenes, a poisonous rivalry appears to have soured  Alec Guinness’s view of Laurence Olivier.

Party snub: Sir Alec Guinness's (with wife Merula in 1964) opinions of fellow actor Laurence Olivier have been revealed in his personal diaries, part of an archive acquired by the British Library

For privately, Sir Alec thought his fellow thespian cruel, unpleasant, destructive and pretentious.

The deliciously un-luvvie spat was revealed in Guinness’s personal diaries, part of an archive acquired by the British Library.

Although he praises Lord Olivier as ‘technically brilliant’ and ‘a total actor’, he adds: ‘He was always very conscious of the audience and his own powers over them.’

Even on the day after Olivier’s death
in July 1989, Guinness apparently couldn’t bring himself to join the 
public tributes unreservedly. In his diary, he branded Olivier 
‘unpleasant, possibly even vindictive’.

Later
entries included snide observations about Olivier’s performances, 
notably his ‘trick’ for making Shakespeare memorable by reading it like 
‘flashes of lightning’.

‘He would chose an obscure line and give it extraordinary emphasis,’ Sir Alec wrote. ‘His “I defy you, stars” in Romeo was memorable. And so was his “Poor naked wretches etc” in Lear.

‘But his famous howl in Oedipus I thought just tiresome.’

In a waspishly barbed compliment, Guinness pays homage to his fellow actor’s acknowledged mastery of production: ‘He knew every trick of the trade and used every one, including when he made his first entrance, the lights coming up a few points and going down again when he left.’

An indication that the venom and 
cattiness was not simply one way came when Guinness recalled a clash in 
1983, when Olivier either failed or feigned not to recognise his wife at
a party.

Guinness thought Olivier was joking at first when he asked her name. ‘Oh yes,’ Olivier had said.

‘Merula Salaman. Isn’t she some sort of relative of yours?’

Sour: Sir Alec Guinness (pictured in Our Man In Havana) described Sir Laurence Olivier as 'possibly vindictive'

‘My
wife for the last 45 years,’ Guinness replied. He duly records: ‘I 
could see Joan Plowright [Lady Olivier] in the room, and, bitchily, I 
couldn’t resist asking, “Is Joan here?” “Over there,” he said. “Do point
her out,” I said, and then moved away.’ Guinness’s 900 letters and more
than 100 volumes of diaries were compiled during a lifetime in acting.

They
were bought recently from his family as part of an archive released 
more than 12 years after the death of the actor, who won an Oscar for 
his role in The Bridge On The River Kwai and went on to play spymaster 
George Smiley in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star
Wars.

Guinness once appeared in a photograph – not in the archive – that showed him arm in arm with Olivier, alongside fellow actor Sir Ralph Richardson.

The trio posed for photographer Terence 
Donovan in the 1980 portrait on condition that it was not published  
until all three were dead. The archive also reveals Guinness to have 
been deeply superstitious.

Ambitious: Sir Laurence Olivier (pictured in Henry V in 1944) was said to have a cruel and destructive streak

He
describes having a misplaced premonition while serving as an officer in
the Royal Navy during the war that he would ‘die tomorrow’.

In
1983 he recorded his sorrow at the death of his friend Richardson – and
described an experience of feeling that someone invisible was helping 
him on with his coat one day.

‘I
felt a shiver of fright, made the sign of the cross, and then 
laughed... Because I thought it was the sort of thing Ralph might have 
done,’ wrote Guinness.

The archive will be open to researchers next year – alongside that of Olivier.
