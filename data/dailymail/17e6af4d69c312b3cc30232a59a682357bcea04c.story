Northern Ireland fans will be allowed to attend their side's Euro 2016 qualifier in Romania in a fortnight after UEFA gave the go-ahead to the Irish Football Association.

A disciplinary case against the hosts following crowd trouble in the 1-1 draw against Hungary had meant a full stadium ban for the November 14 encounter with Michael O'Neill's side had been a possible punishment.

Some Northern Ireland followers had already made and paid for travel arrangements to Bucharest while others were waiting for the verdict, which had been delayed at least twice.

While the precise nature of the ruling on Romania was still unclear on Friday afternoon, the Irish FA - who have been pushing for an answer on behalf of their fans - were able to confirm that there would be no impact on the travelling support.

An IFA statement read: 'The UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body has today met with regards the Romania v Hungary disciplinary case. The Body has reached a decision on the case and UEFA has informed the Irish FA that there will be no impact on Northern Ireland fans attending the European Qualifier against Romania in Bucharest on 14 November.

'Tickets for the game will go on sale online at 9am on Monday 3 November, subject to the confirmation of the ticket allocation from the Romania Football Federation.'
