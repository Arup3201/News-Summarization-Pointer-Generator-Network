Television reality shows normally pulsate with optimism. Participants greet one another with air kisses and whoops of delight.

They look ahead to fame and riches. That's reality TV, right? Not quite. Not in the case of a new Channel 4 series called My Last Summer. Its participants hobble and weep.

Not for them the possibility of years on the Hello! magazine circuit and chat shows. For all these people are - or were - terminally ill. 

All the participants from My Last Summer suffer from a terminal illness, left-right: Andy, Jayne, Ben, Lou and Junior

They decided to talk about their shared predicament in front of the cameras and the result is powerful, emotionally draining television. It may also help us as a society to be a little less distant about death, something I wish I had known earlier. 

The five sorry souls who took part, three of whom have died before the series starts next Wednesday, were taken to a manor house in Gloucestershire.

The opening programme shows the uneasy bonhomie, soon followed by sobbing tears and bursts of bleak anger, as they welcome one another to this most unwelcome of clubs.

Breast-cancer sufferer Jayne, 58, has a penchant for wine, laughter and lipstick. At first encounter she's irrepressible, determinedly insisting that she will keep her head held high. Taciturn Andy seems to be the opposite.

He was told at 41 that he had leukaemia. He nearly overcame the illness, then he developed lung complications which, inescapably, will kill him. Andy has a family and money worries (shortly before his diagnosis he stopped paying into a crucial insurance policy). He walks through the gardens and stoically wonders if he'll be buried there.

Folksy mother of four Lou, whose motor neurone disease is expected to kill her within a year, is just 38. Her youngest daughter, who's six, will not utter the word 'dead'. Instead she says 'chocolate'. 'When you're... chocolate... can I have your phone?' she asks her darling mum. Somehow, Lou manages to laugh at this innocent question. I'm afraid it made me bawl.

'Lou's,  daughter will not utter the word 'dead'. Instead 
she says 'chocolate'. "When you're... chocolate... can I have your 
phone?" she asks her darling mum. I'm afraid it made me bawl'

Former 
disc jockey Junior, 48, was once a dude, quite the Romeo about town (he 
had 11 children by ten women). That was before he learned he had 
prostate cancer. Junior is now struggling to contain his despair. He is 
supported by his girlfriend of 16 months, 46-year-old Sonia, a woman of 
eloquence and beauty.

We
 see them having a searingly upsetting row. 'I just want to give up,' 
says Junior, who is in terrible pain. 'I ain't got the fight in me.'

Sonia
 leaves the car in fury, her saintly patience fraying - and who can 
blame her? Is terminal illness not sometimes as hard for those who watch
 their loved ones dying? I suppose there could be an argument that the 
cameras should have been turned off  - as Sonia at one point requests.

Yet
 there is public value in the insights we gain. Junior is now in a 
better place but the grieving Sonia has done a noble thing in baring her
 emotions so that we may understand better the maelstrom people in her 
position must endure.

Finally we
 meet Ben, 57. He's a former ferry worker who says he's smoked himself 
to an early death. Philosophical, he hopes his fate will alert others 
not only to the dangers of cigarettes but also to the needs of 
terminally ill people to be allowed some normality.

'I'm
 not dying of cancer,' he told me - shortly before he died. 'I'm living 
with cancer.' Ben may look the least healthy of the five but appearances
 can be misleading. We soon see how the amazingly chirpy Jayne is at the
 end of her thread.

She breaks down as she discloses that her husband of 25 years couldn't cope with her illness. On the day she was going for her test results, he reportedly sat in his chair and said, 'I've just made a tomato sandwich' and let her go to the doctor alone.

When she returned with the news that she was terminally ill, he allegedly said, 'Oh', and left the room. Jayne adds, 'If you can't talk to your family and friends about it, who can you talk to?'

Gosh, that question hurt. You see, my dear, quiet, undemonstrative father went through a terminal illness before his death at 82 four years ago. He refused the treatments that might have given him a couple more months.

He faced the demon death with the greatest dignity. Watching My Last Summer forced me to revisit that time - a period, for our family, of heightened memories, an exhausting time when all other life seemed suspended - and I saw how I could have done better. What did this series do to me? I nearly write that it shamed me, but perhaps it is truer to say that it showed me, too late, how I might have behaved in a different way.

Papa was diagnosed with terminal cancer one November afternoon. I was on a train when my mobile rang and one of my sisters gave me the news. I hastened to my parents' house and found my mother on the phone and my father reading the paper.

'Oh, hullo,' he said, as though it was any normal day. 'Your mother shouldn't be long.' Shouldn't be long. Shouldn't be long. To this day the words toll in my mind. Should I have flown to his arms and given him a hug? He was not that sort of father. Yet maybe he would have liked it.

The participants in My Last Summer say it's a relief to meet people in the same boat. At last they find they don't have to explain all the time how they're feeling. Jayne talks of being momentarily 'free from people who just don't know what to say'.

Jayne says her husband went through 'PLOM' syndrome - poor little old me' - and dwelt on his own misfortune at being left behind. It may have been more complicated than that - somewhere out there he will be nursing his grief. But Jayne's words do illustrate the loneliness of the terminally ill and the way that they're denied so much normality.

Lou voices a worry that will, I suspect, make viewers gasp with tears. She knows that her husband John will never be able to play the mumsy role for their girls.

'Daddy's not going to be able to plait their hair or give them motherly chats about periods,' she says with the anguish of knowing another woman will bring up her daughters, yet 'not knowing who they are now. You don't know if they're going to do it right. If they're going to love them right. I want to choose them now. But John will have a fit!'

My father and I had never had a chatty relationship but I wish, in those final months, I'd assured him he had been a fine father. I wish I'd told him how much I respected him. I regret that I allowed my English reserve to trump the imperatives of love.

My mother assures me he knew we all loved him and I'm reasonably sure she's right. Even so, I would now feel more complete if I had described to him the depth of my regard.

'Look,' said Ben, as we finished our conversation, 'I've had a bloody good life. I don't mind sharing the end of it.'

Thank you, Ben, and all who took part in My Last Summer. It may be hard watching for those who have lost loved ones to terminal illness but like the best tragic drama, it leaves you with a sense of catharsis and of understanding better this vale of tears we call life, not least when we know it must soon end.

My Last Summer, Wednesday, 10pm, Channel 4.
