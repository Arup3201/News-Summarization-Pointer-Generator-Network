MailOnline's Fantasy Football season has started in earnest, but there is still time to change your team.

We will be taking a look at players new to the Premier League with the potential to light up England's top tier over the coming campaign.

FRASER FORSTER IN A NUTSHELL

Forster has been at the heart of everything that Celtic have achieved over the past five seasons and he will hope to continue that success on the south coast with new club Southampton.

Having signed for Ronald Koeman's side in a £10million deal earlier in August, the England international has gone straight into Southampton's side as their No 1 goalkeeper.

The 26-year-old is big - he stands at an imposing 6ft 7in tall - and he is a huge presence in goal, filling out the frame and intimidating opposition strikers.

He made his Premier League bow for Southampton against Liverpool on Sunday and, although he was beaten twice, he looked composed and relaxed in his new environment. 

Ready? Fraser Forster has signed for Southampton from Celtic and will test himself in the Premier League

WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE FORSTER IN YOUR MAILONLINE FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM

Forster is a relative newcomer to the Premier League, but he has bags of experience having played more than 250 club matches and having been capped twice by England.

He has kept an incredible 127 clean sheets in 251 matches for Stockport County, Bristol Rovers, Norwich City and Celtic since making his debut in 2008. That is better than a one in every two-game ratio.

Although life may be somewhat tougher in the Premier League with a team who are likely to finish in the middle of the table rather than at a club who won the Scottish league at a canter, Forster's record at every side he has every represented suggests he will bag points on a regular basis.

At just £5.1m in our game, he appears to be a bargain. 

CLEAN SHEET KING 

It is easy to dismiss Forster as only having done well at Celtic because they won the league without being stretched - but his record is still phenomenal.

Last season, Forster set a Scottish Premiership record of 1,256 minutes without conceding a goal and racked up 27 clean sheets in 51 appearances.

It is irrelevant what level he was playing at. That is an exceptional achievement. 

Presence: Forster stands at an imposing 6ft 7in tall and really fills out the frame of the goal he defends

BUT HOW WILL HE PICK UP POINTS? 

Because, if his record is anything to go by, he will keep clean sheets. Yes, Southampton have lost their main defender in Dejan Lovren, but they have a solid unit and Forster performed reasonably well in the Saints' 2-1 loss to Liverpool.

Southampton will face easier tasks than a trip to Anfield, and Forster is bound to pick up points for making some big saves too. 

He also has Champions League experience with Celtic which can only leave him in good stead.

International: Forster has been capped twice by England and was part of Roy Hodgson's World Cup squad 

DON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT

Southampton boss Ronald Koeman has been full of praise for Forster since he signed him and he expects big things from the England international.

'It's a big challenge to play in the Premier League but it's easier to be first choice for England,' Koeman said.

'He's got a good personality. He's very tall. If you see him in goal you'd think it's difficult to beat him. He's also a very good passer,' Koeman said in The Sun. 

Goalkeeping legend Pat Bonner, meanwhile, also lauded the stopper after he broke the Scottish Premiership record for minutes without conceding.

He said: 'What Fraser has achieved has been just incredible - it's a remarkable achievement and all credit to him.

'I've spoken recently about how quick he is for a big goalkeeper. He gets into position quickly, and moves around the goal well and makes these incredible saves.

'I watched him against Hibernian and he produced an unbelievable save where he tipped the ball away with his unorthodox hand. It was a one-of-a-kind save.' 

Stopper: Forster holds the Scottish Premiership record of 1,256 minutes without conceding a goal 

HE'S A CHEAPER VERSION OF...

Forster is the 12th most expensive goalkeeper in the game, but he is certainly not the 12th best in the Premier League.

Expect him to pick up points - and at a better points per price ratio than some of these big names: 

Joe Hart (Manchester City) - £6.0m

Thibaut Courtios (Chelsea) - £5.8m

Petr Cech (Chelsea) - £5.8m 

David de Gea (Manchester United) - £5.7m 

Simon Mignolet (Liverpool) - £5.6m
