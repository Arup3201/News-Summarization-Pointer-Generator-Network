Police have released the frantic 911 call made from the soccer match where referee John Bieniewicz was knocked unconscious after he was punched in the head by a player.

The 44-year-old died at a Detroit hospital on Tuesday following the attack on Sunday at a park in Livonia.

'The referee is knocked out. He's not waking up,' a woman who witnessed the attack can be heard telling officers during the emergency call.

Mr Bieniewicz (pictured with his family), a dialysis technician at Mott Children's Hospital, lived in the Detroit suburb of Westland with his wife and two sons, ages 13 and 9

After the assault, the woman says, the assailant and another man ran to a black Jeep Wrangler featuring 'a huge Brazil flag.'

'Oh God. They're peeling out,' the woman tells the dispatcher.

Police said the attack at the Mies Park game came after Mr Bieniewicz announced his intention to send the man off during the match.

Prosecutors have charged 36-year-old Baseel Abdul-Amir Saad, of Dearborn, with assault with intent to do great bodily harm.

The Wayne County prosecutor's office 
said the charges would be reviewed and possibly amended when it had the 
necessary documentation.

No new charges had been brought as of Wednesday, said Maria Miller, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office.

County medical examiner's spokeswoman Mary Mazur said an autopsy would take place today at the earliest.

Defense lawyer Brian Berry said Saad, an auto mechanic who has been playing soccer for 16 years in the area, is not guilty of the charges and 'wishes to extend his deepest sympathy to the family and friends of John Bieniewicz.'

Mr Berry said Saad has two children and supports two stepchildren.

'Just yesterday, when I visited Mr Saad at the Wayne County jail, he stated: "I just want to go home and hug and kiss my kids,"' Mr Berry said yesterday.

Mr Bieniewicz, a dialysis technician at Mott Children's Hospital, lived in the Detroit suburb of Westland with his wife and two sons, ages 13 and 9. He was a soccer enthusiast who refereed games for two decades.

Two funds have been set up to help with funeral expenses and for Mr Bieniewicz's family. One, set up by friends, had raised $50,000 as of Wednesday afternoon. The other is through Huntington Bank.

Earlier this week Jim Acho, a longtime friend of Mr Bieniewicz, said: 'I speak for all his friends when I say 
we are devastated. Crushed. Just a senseless way for a great guy to go 
out. He deserved better.'

'His friends love him. He lives life to the fullest. Never has a bad day. Ever,' Mr Acho said.

Mr Bieniewicz was doing what he loved on Sunday when he was attacked at Mies Park, Mr Acho said.
