The Republicans are set to win the overall control of the Senate, according to new polling which gives the GOP leads in almost all the key battleground states.

New surveys from NBC News/Marist give the party leads over the opposition in Colorado, Arkansas and Iowa, which could lead to power in the upper house changing hands for the first time in eight years.

It comes as their Democrat opponents took a beating in a separate poll - which registered the highest disapproval from the party across all of Congress in 20 years.

Battle for Akansas: Senate hopeful Tom Cotton, a Republican, (left) has a two-point lead over Senator Mark Pryor (right) in the polls

The new NBC/Marist polls show slender leads for in the three hotly-contested states, Politico reported.

In Arkansas, challenger Rep. Tom Cotton was given 45 per cent of the vote, while Democratic incumbent, Senator Mark Pryor, picked up 43 per cent. Seven per cent were left undecided.

Colorado's race seemed closer, but still favored the Republicans, with a 1-point lead for Rep. Cory Gardner, with 46 per cent, pipping Senator Mark Udall's 45, with 5 per cent of voters undecided.

Iowa in the balance: Joni Ernst (left) is fighting for one of Iowa's seats against Bruce Braley, the Democrat challenger

It is a marked change from polling last month, when Udall led by 6 points.

In Iowa, the third heavily-contested state, the polls gave the GOP's Joni Ernst a three-point lead over Rep. Bruce Braley. Ernst got 49 per cent of the vote against Braley's 46, with 5 per cent undecided.

North Carolina also hangs in the balance, with neither party showing a clear lead. A Republican victory could also be threatened by independent candidate Greg Orman, who could unseat Republican incumbent Pat Roberts.

It came after a Washington Post-ABC News poll delivered a bloody nose to Democrats across the board, after 67 per cent of voters disapproved of their performance in congress.

The disapproval rating is the highest the party has received for 20 years. However the same poll cast dire - though not unprecedented - predictions for the Congressional GOP, with a 72 per cent disapproval rating.

For  Congress as a whole, ennui was even higher, with 79 per cent of Americans disapproving of the national legislature overall.
