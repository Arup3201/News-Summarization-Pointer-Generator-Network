Japanese police have arrested a factory worker accused of lacing frozen meals with pesticide, poisoning thousands of customers and leading to 6 million products being recalled.

Police on Sunday identified the suspect as Toshiki Abe, 49, a worker at Aqlifoods. Abe was arrested Saturday and has denied the charges, police said.

As many as 2,800 people across Japan may 
have been affected by the tainted food, which includes pizzas, croquettes and
 pancakes manufactured at the plant in Gunma prefecture, north of Tokyo.

Toshiki Abe, 49, a factory worker, has been arrested on suspicion of lacing frozen foods with pesticide

Today Abe appeared at the Ota police office in Gunma prefecture, north of Tokyo, as he was sent to the prosecutor's office.

Abe is suspected of lacing the food with the pesticide malathion four times in October. The chemical was found in his possession, according to Kyodo News service.

The scandal has lead to the resignation of the president of Aqulifoods, as well as Toshio Kushiro, the president of its parent company Maruha Nichiro Inc.

The company has also announced executive pay cuts in order to apologise to customers.

The manufacturer has repeatedly said sorry and bought full-page
 ads in major newspapers to warn people not to eat any of the tainted food.

Up to 2,800 customers may have been affected by the poison, which can be lethal in high doses

Malathion, used in farming and gardening, can cause death in high concentrations, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.

No life-threatening illnesses from Maruha's products have been reported, but public trust in food safety has been badly shaken.

In another scandal, late last year a slew of top-notch hotels and department stores acknowledged the food they were serving or selling wasn't what it was billed to be, but cheaper substitutes.
