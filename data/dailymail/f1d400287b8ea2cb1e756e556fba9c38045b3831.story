An MSNBC news anchor has ignited controversy with a TV ad promoting the network, in which she says children belong to communities, not to their parents.

Melissa Harris-Perry, host of a Sunday morning MSNBC show that bears her name, cut the promo spot to promote her program. And conservative pundits Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck are seeing red.

'We have never invested as much in public education as we should have,' Harris-Perry says in the ad, 'because we've always had kind of a private notion of children: "Your kid is yours, and totally your responsibility." We haven't had a very collective notion of "these are our children."'

'So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.'

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Sarah Palin (L) and Glenn Beck (R) lashed out at MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry for suggesting that communities - not individual parents - bear the largest responsibility for raising children

'Once it's everybody's responsibility, and not just the household's, then we start making better investments,' Harris-Perry adds, in a subtle call for more government spending on education programs.

Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, vented her outrage on Twitter.

'Apparently MSNBC doesn't think your children belong to you,' she tweeted. 'Unflippingbelievable.'

The theme of collective child-rearing first most famously caused trouble for American liberals when Hillary Clinton, then the first lady, made a similar argument in her book titled It Takes A Village.

Sarah Palin hit the roof on Twitter after seeing Melissa Harris-Perry's latest network promo ad on MSNBC

Hillary Rodham Clinton, the first lady, published It Takes A Village, which made the point that collective child-rearing was superior to individual parents raising their kids without the government's help or intrusion

Glenn Beck, the conservative former Fox News talk show host who now has his own paywall-protected online TV show, snarked in response to the Harris-Perry commercial that now 'my kids do not belong to me. My kids are not my kids. They are the community's kids.'

'So, I don’t really have responsibility for my kids. I can look to the state to also take that responsibility and, quite honestly, that burden from me.'

Beck editorialized that MSNBC didn't make a gaffe but was consciously endorsing a socialist view of child-rearing.

'This is not a mistake,' he said on The Blaze TV. 'This is the announcement of where they’re headed.'

'What’s really horrible about this,' Beck added, is the idea behind this is going to be so appealing to so many people.'

Mediaite reported that according to an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report, the United States already spends more money per pupil on education than any other country in the world

MSNBC's 'Lean Forward; series of ad promos came under fire in 2012 for its similarity to the Obama re-election campaign's use of 'Forward' as a slogan. MSNBC host Al Sharpton, a Christian reverend, recited the Pledge of Allegiance in one of the spots, omitting the phrase 'Under God.'

MSNBC's 'Lean Forward' slogan has drawn fire for its similarity to the Obama re-election campaign's 'Forward' slogan. The network is widely regarded as the most politically liberal broadcast of the major US news TV outlets
