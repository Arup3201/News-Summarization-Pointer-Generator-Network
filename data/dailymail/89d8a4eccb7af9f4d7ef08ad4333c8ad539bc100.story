Smitten: Hannah Stone is at the centre of a love triangle after she 'fell for' opera singer Bryn Terfel's 'charm offensive'

What a delightful operatic libretto it would make: a story of star-crossed lovers, with a hint of farce.

A beautiful young harpist with golden hair, who plays in royal palaces across the land, entrances two men.

Both are opera singers. One is older, rich and famous, a big hulk of a man; the other is young and fresh-faced and on the cusp of greatness.

They become love rivals. The beautiful harpist marries the younger man, but realises it is the hulk of a man she really loves.

The young woman and her older suitor run off together and are christened by those who have observed the unfolding drama ‘Beauty and the Beast’. Throw in a prince and a few hummable arias and it all has the makings of cracking entertainment.

But this story has happened in real life.

Bryn Terfel, the phenomenally successful 48-year-old Welsh bass baritone, is wildly in love with 27-year-old Hannah Stone, official harpist to the Prince of Wales.

She has walked out on her husband of just two years, Gary Griffiths, an up-and-coming Welsh baritone. To add to 31-year-old Mr Griffiths’s pain, he has frequently been described as ‘the next Bryn Terfel’.

In an interview in June 2012, a month before his nuptials with Miss Stone, Mr Griffiths talked about the similarities between himself  and Bryn.

‘Whenever someone makes a comparison between me and Bryn Terfel, I think it’s incredibly flattering,’ he said.

‘I spoke to him after I won the Gold Medal [an award given by the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, which Bryn won 20 years earlier] and he was extremely supportive. He’s such an incredible artist, but in many ways we are quite different as he’s a bass baritone and I’m a baritone. He’s such a busy guy and he finds  the time to support so many young singers.’

Indeed he does. Harpists, too.

So just how was the lovely Hannah enticed away from the next Bryn Terfel into the arms of the actual Bryn Terfel?

According to a well-placed source within the classical music world, Bryn launched a charm onslaught so intense that eventually Hannah could do nothing but capitulate.

She had married Mr Griffiths in a romantic ceremony on Gower peninsula in South Wales in July 2012 and they had settled together at a property at Cardiff Bay.

Hannah, who was brought up in Swansea, had come to prominence in 2011 when she landed the coveted role of official harpist to the Prince of Wales.

She made her debut in the summer of that year at a charity reception at Charles’s Llwynywermod estate in South Wales, and said just beforehand: ‘I’m a little bit nervous, but I’m excited, too. I auditioned about five weeks ago, then I got a phone call from his [the Prince of Wales’s] secretary and an official letter. I couldn’t believe it.

‘I’ve played the harp since I was eight and ever since I knew about this role it’s been my dream.’

With the role comes prestige — but not a great deal of money. It is an unpaid position, for which  Hannah receives around £3,000 in expenses a year.

She is also part of the La Mer Trio with two other glamorous female  performers, Renate Sokolovska on  the flute and Maja Wegrzynowska  on viola.

Bryn and Hannah had known each other for some time, after repeatedly appearing at the same classical events. It is possible that Bryn was bewitched by the pretty blonde at first sight, but managed to keep his feelings to  himself until his own marriage had broken down.

He had married his childhood sweetheart, Lesley, in 1987, and the couple went on to have three children.

But last year it was revealed that the marriage had collapsed at the end of 2012, after Lesley reportedly fell for a local man called Ian Pleming, who lived on a council estate a mile down the road from the couple’s white-walled mansion outside Caernarfon, Gwynedd.

Meanwhile, Hannah seemed happy enough with Gary, posting this tweet in October last year: ‘Really enjoyed Mid Wales Opera’s Albert Herring!! Me and @Gary-Griffiths chuckled all the way through it!’

But the laughing stopped soon after that, it seems. Two months later, just before Christmas, Bryn and Hannah were thrown together to record the story of the Nativity for a Christmas special for the Welsh language channel, S4C.

Bryn was clearly captivated by the beautiful young musician and posted this tweet during recording: ‘Hannah Stone, our beautiful royal harpist, getting ready for  her solo.’

‘In fact, Bryn swept her off her feet. He
 has a huge presence, a big personality. He pursued her, he paid her a 
great deal of attention. Eventually she capitulated'

At the outset, those around him thought that poor lovelorn Bryn would have no chance with a relatively newly-married woman 20 years his junior.‘The thing is, Hannah was perfectly happy with Gary,’ said a friend of Hannah’s.

‘It wasn’t as though she’d become disillusioned with marriage —  well, there wasn’t really time  for that.

‘It was clear Hannah was being friendly towards Bryn, but most of us thought she was leading him down the garden path.

‘In fact, Bryn swept her off her feet. He has a huge presence, a big personality. He pursued her, he paid her a great deal of attention.  Eventually she capitulated.’

The romance was revealed last weekend, but may have been going on for some time. In the classical music world, it has been an  open secret.

Last month, Bryn watched Hannah perform with La Mer Trio at the Fishguard Music Festival. Afterwards, he helped her load her harp in her car and then they left together. When it was suggested to Ms Stone’s booking agent, Gillian Green, that they were not making a secret of the affair, she said: ‘Yes, I have spent an afternoon with them. Bryn was not playing at the concert, but he came along to it.’

Fishguard Festival manager Geraint Hodges said: ‘It’s not any great secret in music circles that they are a couple.’

Bryn and Hannah are represented by the same musical agency, Harlequins. Their agent, Doreen O’Neill, confirmed to the Mail that they  are on holiday together in Spain this week.

‘They see themselves as soulmates,’ says a friend. ‘They share the same taste in everything — film, music, food. They are in love, very happy and see a long-term future together.

‘Hannah is very sensitive, of course, about how this has been perceived. She is keen not to be seen in a bad light.

‘They both see it as one of those things — a great love, nothing could be done about that. She says they were powerless. They make a striking pair and everyone calls them Beauty and the Beast.’

How their respective spouses feel about this ‘great love’ is another matter. Bryn and Lesley were  married for 25 years, during which time she focused on raising their children as her talented husband’s star rose.

The bass baritone played numerous major roles in operas such as Don Giovanni, Cosi Fan Tutte and Wagner’s Ring operas. Soon the farmer’s son and his wife were living in that mansion outside Caernarfon, overlooking the Snowdonia mountains in one direction and the sea nearby to the west.

The collapse of the marriage and Lesley’s affair with Ian Pleming, who works in a local supermarket and is known as ‘Chops’ to his friends, came as a shock to their friends.

Out at a nightclub one night, Mr Pleming was reportedly attacked by two men — one wielding a glass or bottle — in the early hours as he drank and chatted with Mrs Terfel at the bar.

As he was being consoled by door staff, Mr Pleming told them he was ‘in a relationship’ with Mrs Terfel, adding, as they tended to his injuries, that she was likely to receive an £8 million divorce settlement.

The Terfels are currently going through the painful process of unravelling their finances as part  of the divorce.

Bryn’s company, B Jones Cyfyngedig, which posted profits of £545,172 on its last accounts and appears to be co-run with Lesley, went into voluntary liquidation after the couple split.

At the last accounts, Lesley and Bryn paid themselves £70,500 each in dividends.

Whatever financial settlement Lesley emerges with, it seems that Mr Pleming will not be sharing in her riches — for the Mail can reveal that Lesley’s relationship with Ian has broken down.

His mother confirmed to the Mail this week that the couple are no longer together.

Lesley has remained at the family home in Caernarfon, while Bryn is living at his flat in West London, which is currently being renovated.

Griffiths, meanwhile, was ‘bereft’ when Hannah left him, friends say. It is not known if divorce proceedings are under way.

What, then, will be the final act in this fast-paced libretto?

Will the star-crossed lovers marry, once they have extricated themselves from their current spouses?

Only one thing seems certain. Gary Griffiths, it’s fair to say, will never wish to be referred to as ‘the next Bryn Terfel’ ever again.
