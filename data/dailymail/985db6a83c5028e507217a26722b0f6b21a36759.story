Season tickets and Oyster cards could soon be relics of the past after proposals have been drawn up to introduce a phone and credit card payment system for train travel.  

Under the plans, expected to be published by the Department for Transport (DfT) later this year, rail firms will be expected to introduce new ways for travellers to pay for their tickets online and then use their credit card to open platform barriers.

In the longer term, customers will 
also be able to use their phones in a similar way, replacing completely the need 
for season tickets and Oyster cards.

The scheme will launch in London at the end of this year, before being rolled out to the rest of the rail network - starting with the South- East - the Independent reports.

It will work by using the contactless payment systems which are embedded in most new credit and debit cards.

The technology will soon also be available in smartphones.

Commuters will be able to buy a ticket 
online or on their phone then use either the phone or credit card to 
electronically access ticket barriers.

Transport Secretary Patrick Mcloughlin said buying tickets online is currently 'too complicated'

It is believed the scheme will eventually replace the Oyster card system, which has enjoyed huge success since its launch in 2003.

Rail users will also no longer need to buy weekly or monthly season tickets.

The system will calculate when a customer's travel has exceeded the cost of those tickets - and stop charging.

The Transport Secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, said: 'The journey from buying tickets online to taking your seat on the train is too complicated at the moment.

'By harnessing the latest technology to make the ticketing process easier, we can vastly improve the passenger experience.'

The DfT is also considering budget pricing to manage demand across the rail network more effectively, in a similar way to airlines.

TfL is also working on technology which can tell passengers waiting at a station to see how full trains are, and decide whether to instead wait for the next one.
