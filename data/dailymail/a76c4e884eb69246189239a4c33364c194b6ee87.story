Fat-cat lawyers getting rich on criminal legal-aid cases are to have their fees slashed by almost a third under plans unveiled yesterday.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the best-paid QCs receive more than £500,000 a year courtesy of the taxpayer.

But in ‘very high cost cases’, lasting more than 90 days, he intends to reduce payments by 30 per cent.

Plans: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the best-paid QCs receive more than £500,000 a year courtesy of the taxpayer - but in 'very high cost cases', he intends to reduce payments

The current fees are £500 a day for advocacy, plus up to £150 an hour for preparation work. In 2010/11, six barristers received more than £500,000 each for defending suspected criminals at the taxpayer’s expense.

Mr Grayling said: ‘We have an excellent tradition of legal aid and one of the best legal professions in the world. But we cannot close our eyes to the fact legal aid is still costing too much.

‘It is not free money - it is paid for by hard-working taxpayers, so we must ensure we get the very best value for every penny spent.’

The fee reduction is part of a string of measures designed to slash £220million from the criminal legal-aid bill, which is currently more than £1billion a year.

In other measures, defendants living in households with a disposable income of £37,500 or more would not automatically be given legal aid.

Mr Grayling also wants to see criminals pay for the cost of running courts out of their future earnings. Offenders can already be required to make payments to victims, the courts or other government agencies through a range of orders and fines.

But there is currently no power to make them pay directly towards the running costs of the court, such as security and staff.

Mr Grayling decided to act after seeing the sums paid to the highest-earning QCs. The largest legal-aid bills normally involve cases of money laundering, fraud or terrorism.

The QC who earned the most from criminal legal aid in 2010/11 is a barrister who represents people accused of multi-million-pound tax frauds. John Charles Rees, based in Cardiff, was paid £554,152.

The Criminal Bar Association, which represents barristers, says the legal-aid totals may cover several years of work and include VAT. Bills are paid by the Government when a case is complete.

In a wide-ranging review,  Mr Grayling also announced that there will be a further crackdown on civil legal aid.

A residency test will be introduced to prevent legal aid going to immigrants who have lived in Britain for less than a year. And prisoners will be denied legal aid unless the case relates to their sentence.

Mr Grayling said taxpayers’ money is being used for ‘unnecessary legal cases’ that could be dealt with by the prison service, such as which category of jail an inmate is being kept in.

Solicitors criticised other plans to make them compete for some legal contracts in the future.

Lucy Scott-Moncrieff, president of the Law Society, said: ‘We also think it is implausible that tendering will save the sort of sums of money the Treasury is looking for, and there is some doubt whether it will save anything at all.’

Last week, reforms to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act came into effect, removing large areas of law from the scope of civil legal aid. These included welfare and family law.

Some law firms estimated that the reforms will reduce the number of people who qualify for legal aid by 75 per cent.

The crackdown follows outrage that former fugitive Asil Nadir received more than £1million in legal aid while renting a £23,000-a-month London residence during his trial for stealing £28.8million from his Polly Peck empire in the 1980s.

The former Tory donor, who was jailed for ten years last August, received £230,409 to pay solicitors and £641,072 for his barristers. A further £185,000 went on court costs known as disbursements.

Other criminals who have milked the legal-aid system include convicted gangster Terry Adams, who got £4.7million, and the Connors family, the caravan park owners who kept homeless drug addicts and alcoholics as virtual slaves.

The Connors family owned homes with hot tubs, a fleet of cars including a Rolls-Royce and a Mercedes, enjoyed Caribbean cruises and holidays in Mexico and Dubai, and had £500,000 in the bank.

Yet they were still able to claim around £500,000 in legal aid. They received the payments because their assets were frozen and, pending prosecution, these cannot be taken into account when assessing a suspect’s wealth.
