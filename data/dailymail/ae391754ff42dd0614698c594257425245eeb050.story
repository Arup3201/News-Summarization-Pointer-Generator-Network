Around 2,000 people a year die from skin cancer each year in Australia.

Now an enterprising trio of young designers have created an outfit made from 50+ sun protection fabric, aimed at keeping the sun’s harmful rays away from the skin.

The students at WA’s Central Institute of Technology were tasked with creating an outfit that ‘incorporates sun protection with youth fashion’ by the Sunsmart team at Cancer Council WA.

‘Living in Australia means we’re at high risk of developing skin cancer, but you don’t have to compromise fashion to protect yourself,’ Sunsmart said.

Cassandra Pittard, Silvia Dzemail and Lauren Willems designed the winning grey jumpsuit.

The only bit of skin that it shows are the forearms and lower legs, thanks to three-quarter length sleeves and cropped trousers.

The simple design features a breast pocket and stitching around the two pockets on the waist.

‘Young people are often fashion and image conscious, and unfortunately this can come at the cost of sun protection,’ SunSmart Campaign Coordinator Carolyn Minto said.

‘The project encourages the designers of tomorrow to show that fashion and sun protection can go hand in hand. 

‘Melanoma is the most common cancer in young people, and this project is a way of improving attitudes towards sun protection in this group,’ she said.

Australia has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world

This is the fourth SunSmart fashion garment produced out of the partnership. The design is now on sale in a local store, Ruck Rover General Store in Northbridge, WA.

Australia has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world, with two in three Australians diagnosed with skin cancer by the age of 70.

The disease costs the health system around $512.3 million annually, as reported in 2010,  the highest cost of all cancers.
