This huge seventeenth-century barn could be yours for an absolute bargain - as long as you don't mind a bit of DIY.

The enormous structure, which is on the the market for only £100,000, has been dubbed the ultimate flat-pack challenge for any Ikea fan.

Made from dozens of solid oak beams, it will be delivered to the buyer completely dismantled.

But don't worry if you're not handy with a hammer - there's no sign of an Allen key, picture instructions or a Swedish meatball in sight. 

Instead, each piece of timber has been numbered and an expert in historic buildings will be on hand to help rebuild it.

This CGI image shows what the barn, which is on sale for a mere £100,000 after 25 years in storage, could look like when it is assembled 

The barn will be delivered to the buyer completely dismantled with each solid oak beam numbered to make it easier to put together

The building began life as a thatched tithe barn at Acton Hall, a grand country estate near Stowmarket in Suffolk, before being converted into a house in its own right. 

There, it stood for 350 years on a country estate until the owners decided they no longer wanted it.

Under threat of being sold off in individual chunks, the barn was salvaged by John Langdon, an expert in preserving historic barns, in the early 1990s.

It was dismantled and sold to a brewery 25 years ago who planned to turn it into a unique venue for functions but a suitable location for it was never found.

It has been in storage ever since until it was recently listed for sale again following a change of heart by the brewery. 

It has now gone on sale at Summers Place auction house at Billingshurst, West Sussex, with an auction to take place on October 22.

And although the barn is currently in pieces, it can easily be reassembled into a structure that is 121ft long, 28ft wide and 25ft tall by a team of experts. 

But despite a pre-sale estimate of £100,000, it will cost another £100,000 to put it back together and transform it into a grand house, office or function hall.

Mr Langdon, from Petworth, West Sussex, said: 'The barn dates back to the mid-17th century when it would have been used as a tithe barn to store lots of different things in.

'It was dismantled about 25 years ago on a big farm estate where it was getting in the way of modern farm buildings being built.

'It was going to be sold off as individual timbers so we bought the whole lot, numbered it up, dismantled it and found a new home for it with a brewery.

'It was intended to remain as an open plan building that would be used for functions but the brewery never got round to finding the right site for it.

'In the end they asked us to buy it back from them, which we did.

The barn first stood at Acton Hall, a grand country estate near Stowmarket in Suffolk.

It was a thatched thithe barn before it was converted into a house.

After 350 years, under threat of being sold off in parts, it was salvaged by John Langon, an expert in preserving historic barns, in the early 1990s. 

It was bought by a brewery 25 years ago to turn into a venue for functions but a location was never found.

It has now come out of storage and gone on sale at Summers Place auction house in Billingshurst, West Sussex.

'The barn is made up of many tonnes of beams that we have been storing.

'It's like the ultimate Ikea flatpack, which is exactly how things were made back then.

'The only differences are that we will deliver it to the buyer and they won't need an Allen key to put it up - we will help re-erect it too.

'The barn is hugely historic - very few buildings last as long as its been around, and it will easily last another 500 years.

'The framework is hand hewn from oak and it is held together entirely with mortise and tenon oak pegs and it's in amazing condition.

'I can confidently say there will never be another barn like this come up for sale.

'We are expecting offers over £100,000 and it would probably cost the same again to erect and turn into a house.

'That's cheaper than buying a terraced house in some parts of the country.

'We think it would make an ideal wedding venue - there's a real demand for unique wedding venues and we think this building would be wonderful for just that.

'It is an exceptional building, a unique situation and an absolute bargain.'
