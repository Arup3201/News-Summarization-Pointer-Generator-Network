A female hippo proved that you should never come between a mother and her baby - no matter the species after she took on two attackers singlehandedly when they went for her calf.

The hippo mother was enjoying some bonding time with her young calf,Â  at the Okovango Delta in Botswana, when a male and female hippo interrupted.

The assailants went for the baby, throwing it into the air with their fangs, and submerging it into the water during the vicious fight.

According to wildlife guide Joe Molekoa at the Seba camp in Botswana, who took the pictures, the calf's life was at risk during the fight, but the mother managed to grab it and swim away.

Fortunately, when Mr Molekoa returned the next day to find all was well with mother and baby who had returned to their tranquil routine.
