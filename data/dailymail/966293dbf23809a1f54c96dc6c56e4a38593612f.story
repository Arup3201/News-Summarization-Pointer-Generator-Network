A pensioner who was blinded by a police water cannon flew to Britain to confront police over plans to bring in the controversial weapon last night.

Dietrich Wagner, 69, was left with just five per cent vision in both eyes after being blasted at close range by water cannon during an environmental protest in his hometown of Stuttgart, Germany about a train station development.

The force of the jet of water fired from just 15 feet away tore his eyelids, irreparably damaging his eyes and fracturing the orbital bone around the eye.

Mr Wagner, 69, suffered terrible injuries from a water cannon at an environmental protest in his native Germany. Pictured is a water cannon being used during a recent protest in Turkey

Mr Wagner said of the incident on September 30, 2010: 'It was like a punch in the face.

'The punch was crammed with pain.

'I can remember falling over backwards. It went very quiet and I lost consciousness.

'When I came around all I could see was black. I remember screaming, "help me I can't open my eyes".'

Surgeons battled to save the retired engineer's sight but after six operations to reconstruct his eye socket, he can now only make out dim shapes.

Yesterday he flew from Germany to London to address a public meeting debating the use of the tactic in Britain.

He said: 'Water cannon are dangerous and they cannot solve social issues.

'They are costly and unnecessary. I worry that people like me could be injured like me.

'It is my duty to make the people of London aware of how lethal these weapons are.

'Before my injury, I had no idea of the damage they could cause.

'I am lucky to be alive. Doctors said that if it went on for a minute more, the force of the water would have caused brain damage.'

Disorder: After the riots of August 2011, Scotland Yard boss Bernard Hogan-Howe has been calling for officers to have access to the high-pressured cannon

He added: 'The police also need to know what this will mean for their relationship with the public.

'They used to be respected and seen as a force for good in Stuttgart. But since 2010, this relationship has been damaged beyond repair, and there is now a deep mistrust and hostility towards the police by most people in the city.

'The use of water cannon is akin to the breakdown of the democratic process. I strongly urge the Mayor of London, Theresa May and London's police not to introduce this weapon.' London Mayor Boris Johnson wants Britain's biggest police force to be armed with the fearsome weapon by the Summer.

In the wake of the riots of August 2011, Scotland Yard boss Bernard Hogan-Howe has been calling for officers to have access to the high-pressured cannon to quell possible future outbreaks of disorder.

More than 35,000 people have signed a petition against the plans

But the Home Secretary Theresa May has refused to fund it as a 'national asset' for forces.

Now Boris Johnson is pressing ahead with a public consultation on the scheme, telling the Home Secretary he is happy to fund the machines after receiving assurances from the Met Commissioner that they will be 'rarely used and rarely seen' only in the most extreme circumstances.

More than 35,000 people have signed a petition against the plans and last week the London Assembly voted against the Mayor's proposal to spend Â£200,000 on three second-hand German water cannon.

Among those who voted against the scheme last Friday were four key Conservative members including Kit Malthouse, the former deputy mayor for policing and James Cleverly, the chairman of the London fire authority.
