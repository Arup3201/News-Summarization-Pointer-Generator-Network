Samantha Kidd leaves Brighton Magistrates' Court today after denying six charges of assault by beating

The estranged wife of stunt motorcyclist Eddie Kidd appeared in court today to deny charges relating to domestic abuse.

Samantha Kidd, 44, faces six charges of assault by beating Mr Kidd between July and October last year.

Four of the charges were said to have taken place in East Sussex, one in Southampton and another in Cumbria.

Mrs Kidd, of Seaford, East Sussex, denied all the charges during the short hearing at Brighton Magistrates’ Court.

Mrs Kidd was released on bail and told not to contact her husband or go to his address.

She is however, on one occasion allowed to go with police to pick up some of her property from his house.

District Judge Stephen Nicholls said: ‘If you fail to attend the trial it could take place in your absence.’

The trial, expected to last a day and a half, will take place on July 9 and July 10 at Brighton Magistrates’ Court.

Mrs Kidd was arrested in December last year, days after it had emerged the former Grange Hill actress was no longer living with her disabled husband.

Mr Kidd, 53, is confined to a 
wheelchair and needs round-the-clock-care after suffering brain damage 
when a 1996 motorcycle jump over 13 buses went wrong.

He has been married twice previously to Hot Gossip dancer Debbie Ash and former Stringfellows nightclub waitress Sarah Carr.

Eddie, who is paralysed and brain damaged after a motorbike stunt went horrifically wrong in 1996, defied doctors who said he would never walk again to complete the gruelling course.

In his prime Kidd was one of the most famous stunt riders in the world.

He first stunned spectators, fans and press in December 1979, when he jumped 80ft across the gap in a derelict railway bridge in Essex on a 400cc Yamaha.

Kidd's achievements culminated in 1993 when he jumped the Great Wall of China and beat Robbie Knievel, son of Evel Knievel, to the stunt bike world championship.

However, his life changed forever when he suffered serious head and pelvic injuries after a failed stunt jumping over a speeding car at the Bulldog Bash rally in Warwickshire in 1996 and was in a coma for six weeks.
