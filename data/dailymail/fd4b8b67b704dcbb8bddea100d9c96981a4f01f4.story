A science teacher who took a pupil to concerts and had sex with her on the way home has been jailed for three-and-a-half years.

Married father-of-one Paul Burford, 38, parked up in lay-bys and service areas after driving the 15-year-old to gigs including White Snake and Thin Lizzie guitarist Gary Moore.

Over two years, he had sex with her on the street in her uniform, gave her sex toys, and bought them matching rings.

Burford was a science teacher at Darlington Branksome School when he kissed first his 14-year-old student in 2010. The liaison continued for two years until the girl went to the police

The science teacher even continued the liaison for a year after being interrogated by Child Protection officers - who desisted when he claimed to be teaching the girl guitar.

The girl was 14 when Burford, then a science teacher at Branksome School in Darlington, kissed her in a classroom when they were alone, Teesside Crown Court heard.

From 2010, they had sex at his homes in Darlington and Sadberge, both in County Durham, while his wife was with her parents in Carlisle, said prosecutor David Lamb.

Once they had sex in the street in West Auckland Road, Darlington, when she was in her school uniform.

The girl finally went to police in May 2012 and they arrested Burford who was then assistant head at a school in Devon.

He is now separated from his wife and eight-year-old daughter.

Teesside Crown Court heard he had sex with the girl on the street in her uniform and gave her sex toys

He confessed the affair to his father on his deathbed, said Amrit Jandoo, defending.

Mr Jandoo added: 'He apologises to the complainant, the school and his family.

'He accepts that his behaviour has had a devastating effect on her life and his own life.'

Judge Tony Briggs told Burford: 'It is perfectly obvious that custody is inevitable and it has to be for a man of your age and background a significant sentence.'

Burford, from Plymouth, was jailed for three and a half years after pleading guilty to 14 charges of engaging in sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust.

He was also put on the sex offenders' register, and given an indefinite Sexual Offenceâ€™s Prevention Order banning contact with under-age girls.
