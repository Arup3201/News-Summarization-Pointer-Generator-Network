A girl who was left scarred by a violent random attack on a night out could become the next Miss England after her boyfriend convinced her to enter a beauty pageant.

Alexandra Homayoonpoor, 24, had her nose sliced almost in two in an unprovoked in Leeds on New Years' Eve.

Despite initially feeling 'so ugly' she had to hide from her friends, she is now on course to become the next Miss England after being crowned Miss West Yorkshire.

'I was convinced to enter a beauty pageant after my the glassing left me with a scarred nose and I felt unattractive. It was to try and boost my confidence,' said Alexandra, who is known as Lexi.

'Even after surgery I have been left with a little notch on my nose, but I have come to live with it.'

Bouncing back: Alexandra Homayoonpoor has made a remarkable recovery and has just been crowned Miss West Yorkshire, boosting her bid to become the next Miss England

Lexi, who works for a PR company in Otley, West Yorks says: 'The doctors have offered me reconstructive surgery, but I have declined because I am happy the way I am now.'

Her nostril had to be surgically reattached after a group of men attacked her and her boyfriend in a bar on New Year's Eve.

Lexi was glassed in the face on New Year's Eve 2010 in The Box pub, Headingley, Leeds, when a thug struck her with a broken glass.

Scarred: Lexi suffered terrible injuries during a night out in 2010

The then 21-year-old was left with a 4cm laceration to her nose and a nose stud she had been wearing was left embedded in the wound along with a piece of glass - which was stuck so deep it could only be detected by X-ray.

Plastic surgeons worked for an hour to save her nose, reattaching her nostril with 12 stitches at Leeds General Infirmary.

Lexi - who had never previously thought of being a beauty queen or modeling - felt too deformed to even see her closest friends for three months after her injury.

But her then boyfriend Ben Johnson, 25, convinced her to pluck up courage and enter the local beauty pageant.

'I didn't win first time, but I really enjoyed the contest and I felt more glamorous.

'I'm too short to be a model - I'm 5' 5" and you need to be at least 5' 7" - but getting this far is a real honour.'

Recalling the night of the attack, 
Lexi, whose father is Iranian, said: 'This idiot in the pub swiped his 
arm across a table of bottles and glasses and I was hit in the face.

'It
felt like I had been punched in the face. My arm was covered in cuts 
from the glass and the next thing I knew my face was streaming with 
blood.

'It was everywhere, and I was hysterical, screaming "He's broken my nose, he's broken my nose!

'I
couldn't understand why there was so much blood. I knew I hadn't been 
punched but there was so much blood, it was just gushing from my face. I
was covered in it.

'No one would tell me what had happened. People just kept saying, "Don't worry, it'll heal, it'll heal".

'It
was only after the paramedics took me to A&E that my dad came and 
told me that my nose had been sliced open on one side, from the front 
right the way to the back.

Lexi says she turned to the beauty queen circuit in a bid to boost her self confidence after the attack

 Alexandra Homayoonpoor's case is still open as the attackers who glassed her have still not been caught

'They couldn't operate on me that night and I had to go back the next day to have an operation under general anaesthetic.

'They X-rayed me and said that there was a piece of glass still stuck in there, which they would have to remove and they had to cut out my nose stud which had become caught up in the flesh.

'No one knows exactly what happened, but the doctors said that because of the way it was cut a glass probably hit me straight in the face and smashed on impact."

Footage from CCTV cameras at the club where the incident happened was not clear enough to identify Alexandra's attackers, who were kicked out by management immediately afterwards.

No one took their details and the police had no evidence to go on, meaning her case remains open.

Alexandra said: 'I had always dreamed of entering the competition because I am basically just a little girl deep down who loves dressing up and feeling like a princess.

'Winning Miss West Yorkshire has not really sunk in yet. It was amazing, I was overwhelmed.'

Lexi needed 12 stitches to repair the damage and to remove a shard of glass.

The eventual winner of Miss England goes through to the Miss World competition, which has a cash prize of £100,000.
