What's the best way to erase an ex-lover from your life?

As Victorian artist William Holman Hunt found, painting over her is a good start.

His portrait of this pre-Raphaelite beauty (main picture) did not always feature the steady gaze of this striking woman with dramatic brows and a tumble of auburn curls.

The new beauty: Fanny Waugh's face in the finished portrait

Some years earlier it was the face of the artist’s previous lover and model Annie Miller, above, smiling out from the painting.

When she ended her affair with Hunt in 1859, the unfinished canvas lay untouched for years until Hunt fell in love with Fanny Waugh – the woman who would become his wife. That’s when he got the painting out, scraped off Annie’s face and replaced it with Fanny’s.

The secret about-face is revealed in an X-ray released by Tate Britain, where the painting will go on display this month as part of the Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde exhibition.

The X-ray was taken during routine 
cleaning of the painting. Although Hunt removed Annie’s face all those 
years ago, some remnants can  still be seen thanks to the fact  that he 
originally painted on to a white background.

Annie’s mouth is smaller than Fanny’s and she has a shorter, rounder nose and less defined jawline.

Experts say, however, that the finished painting of Fanny still bears Annie’s hands and maybe even hair.

Historians
believe Hunt had intended to marry Annie but she was fiercely 
independent and enjoyed the company of other men too much. Dante Gabriel
Rossetti, who along with Hunt and John Everett Millais founded the 
Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in 1848, is thought to have also been her 
lover.  

Hunt’s wife Fanny died in childbirth in 1866 – the year the portrait was finally finished.

The painting, Il Dolce far Niente, also features a different background arrangement to the original draft, and the artist even sewed an extra piece of canvas on to make it bigger.

In his memoirs, Hunt indicated that a third woman – a professional model known only as Miss Foster – also sat for the piece, but she is not discernible from the X-Ray.

Curator Alison Smith said: ‘Hunt was a sincere and intense  man. He was attracted to striking-looking women. He loved strong independent types.

‘When Annie left him, he was devastated. He was very jealous of her relationships with other artists and quite controlling. He put the unfinished portrait aside when it ended and took it up again when he had a new fiancée.

‘The painting's title means “It is sweet to do nothing“, so presumably she’s looking out at someone who is her lover. She’s dallying in front of her  betrothed.

‘It’s a picture about acceptance, so it’s quite  understandable that the artist would want to show the  woman he wanted to spend his life with.’

The exhibition at London’s Tate Britain begins on September 12.
