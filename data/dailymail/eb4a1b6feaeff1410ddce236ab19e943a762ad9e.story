A desperate man climbed to the top of the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday afternoon and threatened to jump.

Police closed the Bridge in both directions on because of the potential jumper.

The man was first spotted on the edge of the western Brooklyn Bridge balustrade around 3 p.m. It is unclear how the man got there.

Traffic on the bridge came to a halt and police blocked the pedestrian walkway as negotiations got underway to coax the man down.

On the edge: Six cops from the NYPDs Emergency Services Unit try and talk the man down from the ledge atop a 276ft tower on the Brooklyn Bridge

Five cops from the NYPD’s Emergency 
Services Unit wearing bright blue helmets and tethered to the bridge, 
scaled the cables to get to the top of the 276-foot tower in order to 
try to prevent the man from jumping.

Hundreds of people gathered to watch 
the standoff and some cars attempted to back up off the bridge. There 
were traffic jams for several blocks.

Jordana Rothman
tweeted 'Cop walking among the trapped cars screaming 'MAKE YOUR OWN 
JUDGEMENT' re: backing up off the Brooklyn Bridge. This is gonna go 
well.'

One step at a time: Police scaled the dizzying heights of the the Brooklyn Bridge in order to talk the man down. 90 minutes later their efforts were rewarded

Negotiations: Here you can see the outstretched arms of an NYPD negotiator attempting to convince the man not to take his own life

Alone: Police try to convince the man to come back down to the ground

took some pictures with a telescope from the South Street Seaport and 
saw one of the police officers offering the man chewing gum.

The man was seen to be sitting on the top of the tower for a time before he started to pace back and forth.

The standoff came to a peaceful end with the man deciding to come down.
