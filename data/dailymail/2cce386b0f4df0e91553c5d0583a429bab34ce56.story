A hapless thief was caught red-handed on CCTV - but walked free from court when the charge was withdrawn because of a police error.

Edward Goble, 28, broke into a garage in Essex and stole a £400 scooter and a box of records - but victim Pauline van Dijk managed to get hold of a photo of him from a surveillance camera.

She posted the image on a neighbourhood 
Facebook page called Basildon Memories, and within minutes, one of the 4,000 members had identified Goble.

He was arrested the same day and made a full confession to police 
officers, but yesterday, a burglary charge against him was 
withdrawn at Basildon Magistrates' Court.

it is understood that the case fell down because  Goble has mental 
health problems and police failed to interview him with another adult.

Ms Van Dijk said she was outraged that he was let off the hook.

She said: 'He was caught bang to rights. The CCTV pictures proved he 
was there and that he took the stuff, plus he admitted it, and when the 
police caught him the same night he was in the same clothes.'

But Essex Police say he was 
assessed by a healthcare professional and was deemed fit to be 
interviewed without another adult being present.

A police spokesman added: 'It is 
unfortunate that this case could not be proceeded and we will be looking
to see if our procedures could be tightened up to ensure that this does
not occur again.'

The police said they did not contact the victim or any other witnesses because Goble had admitted to the offence.

Ms Van Dijk added: 'Whether he has mental health problems or not, he knows stealing off people is wrong.'

The scooter was worth £400 and was recovered.

Goble, of Basildon, was
also in court to face another charge of attempted burglary at a 
house in his area on July 15.

He had earlier pleaded guilty, and was handed a 12-month community order, including 
supervision, and ordered to go on a mental health treatment course.

After his sentence was passed, he said: 'I know it was wrong to commit the offence.'

A CPS spokesperson said: 'In light of the defence’s argument that an appropriate adult was not present during the police interview of the defendant, the CPS lawyer in court informed the magistrates that the case would be withdrawn for the police to make inquiries with a view to it later being reinstated.'
