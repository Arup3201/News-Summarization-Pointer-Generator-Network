A woman has been put into isolation at Northampton General Hospital with a suspected case of Ebola, it has emerged.

The hospital released few details about the patient last night but it is believed she had recently travelled abroad.

A spokesman for the hospital said: 'I can confirm that we have a suspected case of Ebola. It is a female adult. She will be in isolation if she is suspected of having the illness.'

The hospital spokesman said she was unable to provide further details about the identity of the woman or how she may have contracted the illness.

It comes just two days after it was revealed the condition of Pauline Cafferkey had improved - the 39-year-old nurse was struck down by the virus after returning from Sierra Leone in west Africa.

In recent months Northampton General Hospital has attempted to reassure the public it has plans in place to manage cases of Ebola in the event of an outbreak.

A spokesman said: 'We have robust systems and processes which will ensure we are able to identify and isolate a patient who presents with symptoms of Ebola or any other infectious disease.

'We have sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment, and access to expert testing and advice.

'We would like to reassure local people that the risk of infection in the UK remains very low.

'Nevertheless we are being extremely vigilant and taking all appropriate measures to ensure we are fully prepared. Our plans are being kept under continuous review and amended as the situation changes.'

Miss Cafferkey had been a volunteer with Save the Children at the Ebola Treatment Centre in Kerry Town but only became ill when she returned to Britain just after Christmas.

After taking an experimental anti-viral drug and receiving blood plasma transfusions from a European Ebola survivor at the Royal Free Hospital in north London, her condition improved.

A hospital spokesman said Monday: 'The Royal Free Hospital is pleased to announce that Pauline Cafferkey is showing signs of improvement and is no longer critically ill.

'She remains in isolation as she receives specialist care for the Ebola virus.'

David Cameron welcomed the news during Prime Minister's Questions at the House of Commons. He said he was sure everybody was thinking of her, adding: 'It is very good news that she is out of critical care, but there is still a long way to go.'

He was responding to Conservative Nicola Blackwood, who said: 'I'm sure the whole House will want to honour the bravery of NHS Ebola volunteers and welcome the news that nurse Pauline Cafferkey is off the critical list.'

She also raised the work going on in Oxford to develop a vaccine, which the Tory leader called 'vitally important'.

He added: 'The minister for government policy is leading the work on this and making sure we do everything to try and cut through some of the bureaucracy that otherwise would be in place so that we can develop a vaccine fast.'

There are currently no specific drugs to cure Ebola, nor any approved vaccines to prevent the disease. 

Two experimental vaccines are currently being trialled on human volunteers in the UK, US, Mali and Uganda.

Experts expect to see the first results of those trials early next year.

The Royal Free Hospital is the only High Level Isolation Unit in the UK to house two high-security containment beds.

They are located inside isolation 'bubbles' - specially-designed tents with controlled ventilation allowing medics to provide clinical care while containing the infection.

Three other hospitals - The Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne Royal Victoria Infirmary and Sheffield Teaching Hospitals - are designated centres for escalation if more patients are diagnosed with Ebola.

There are around 50 other designated Ebola beds at these three centres.

Around 45 per cent of those infected in the current outbreak have survived without treatment.

ZMapp, developed by US biotech company Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc, is manufactured in the leaves of genetically modified tobacco plants.

The process could yield 20 to 40 doses a month.

Evidence suggests that effective treatment with ZMapp requires three doses of 15 milligrams per kilogram of body weight.

It is thought the blood of those who have survived the disease may contain antibodies, which can prove effective in fighting the disease.

The nurse, from Cambuslang, South Lanarkshire, had volunteered with Save the Children at the Ebola Treatment Centre in Kerry Town, Sierra Leone, before returning to the UK.

Save the Children has launched an investigation into how she was infected, but admits it may never establish the exact circumstances.

She flew back to the UK via Casablanca in Morocco. Her temperature was tested seven times before she flew from Heathrow to Glasgow and she was cleared to travel.

She later became feverish and followed advice given to her at Heathrow to contact local services and was admitted to an isolation facility at the Brownlee unit in Gartnavel Hospital, Glasgow, at 8am on December 29.

After a blood sample tested positive for Ebola, she was transferred in a military plane to the Royal Free Hospital by 8am on December 30.
