We all dream of owning a little place in the country, though most would admit 12 bedrooms, 85 acres, a cricket pitch and a Roman mosaic is a bit much.

Not so for the millionaire owner of Nottingham Forest FC, who has bought a £4million 19th Century stone mansion as his part-time bolthole.

Aged 45 and from one of Kuwait's wealthiest families, Fawaz Al-Hasawi is expected to live in Grade II* listed Dunstall Hall for some of the year and spend the rest of the time in his home country.

Holiday cottage: We all dream of owning a little place in the country, but not like this. The millionaire owner of Nottingham Forest FC has bought the 19th Century stone mansion Dunstall Hall, near Burton, Staffordshire, for £4million - as his part-time bolthole. The home was on the market for a year and the price was lowered by £1m

Sumptuous: The mansion has stained glass windows, grand chandeliers, classical friezes, carvings, paintings and a Roman mosaic of Cerberus the three-headed dog

We're going to need a substitution: The dining room table seats 20 - an unfortunate number if 45-year-old Mr Al-Hasawi wants to invite the Nottingham squad for supper

Originally a hunting lodge on the brow of a hill in Needwood Forest, the mansion near Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, sits on a former 1,500-acre estate which dates back to 1145 when it was owned by the Earl of Derby.

In the 19th Century it was owned by the son of Sir Richard Arkwright, a leader of the Industrial Revolution who invented the spinning frame bearing his name, before being bought by the Hardy family in 1851 who turned the Old Manor House into the grand home it is today.

At the entrance to the hall stands an imposing 1850 portico-like structure whose legend reads: ‘ISQUI DEDIT MIHI SERVET’ (He who has 
given watches over me).

Things get better inside, where the mansion has stained glass windows, grand chandeliers, classical friezes, carvings and a dining table that seats 20, just short of a full squad.

The great hallway boasts a Roman mosaic of Cerberus the three-headed dog, who guarded the entrance to the mythical underworld, which is said to have been appropriated from the ancient settlement at Trivoli near Rome, Italy.

Each main room leads into the hallway, and the whole mansion is L-shaped to make as many views as possible of the grounds, which nowadays are a more modest 85 acres and include parkland, a cricket pitch, gardens and a lake.

Room with a view: One of the 12 bedrooms in the mansion, which underwent extensive renovation in the last 15 years including new wiring and plumbing

Grand: The main hall is dominated by a staircase with detailed depictions of animals set amongst foliage carved by the master craftsman Edward Griffiths in 1899

Luxury: Over the last six years the mansion has been used as a grand wedding venue after it was bought by the bookmaking millionaire Barry Morgan and converted

Alongside the main home, Mr Al-Hasawi will also get an integrated one-bedroom apartment, a former stable block which is now a 
three-bedroom cottage, offices and garages.

The house was bought in 1997 by the racing tycoon Sir Stanley Clarke, and after his death it fell into the hands of Barry Morgan, the former owner of bookmaker Needwood Racing.

He turned it into a corporate venue which hosted sumptuous weddings, including in the grand stone orangery attached to the main house - a use which could possibly continue under its new owner.

The home was on the market for more than a year and the price is believed to have dropped by around £1million before the sale was completed.

Estate agent Strutt and Parker said it has undergone a complete refurbishment with new wiring and plumbing in the last 15 years.

'The house now presents 
itself as a wonderful opportunity to be used as a family home or 
business', the estate agents said. 'The house is mainly built of ashlar stone and is L-shaped 
making the most of the views and surrounding park.

Manicured: The estate's current 85 acres include parkland, gardens, a lake and a private cricket pitch for the 45-year-old (good practice for if he ever switches sports)

Grandiose: The mansion was once the hunting lodge on an estate whose origins can be dated to the 12th Century. In the mid-1800s is was hugely expanded

Stained glass: The mansion includes highly decorative windows and is now owned by Fawaz Al-Hasawi, the 45-year-old chairman of Nottingham Forest FC (right) who succeeded his cousin Omar in December 2012. He can also enjoy a ballroom, vaulted ceilings and grand arches - when he's not in his home country of Kuwait, that is

'The main reception 
hall is dominated by a magnificent staircase, which has detailed 
depictions of animals set amongst foliage carved by the craftsman, 
Edward Griffiths, in 1899.

'The sitting room is interlinked to the
 long library through double mahogany doors providing very flexible 
entertaining space.

'The passageway from the great hall features a series
 of arches, exquisitely decorated vaulted ceilings and stained glass 
windows overlooking an internal courtyard.

'The
 ballroom is a rare surviving gem from the age of Victorian 
extravagance. The cross- beamed ceiling with gilded frieze depicting 
classical figures supports a trio of magnificent chandeliers. The oak 
sprung dance floor is complemented by polished wood panelling.'

The chairman succeeded his cousin Omar at the helm of Nottingham Forest in December 2012, a turbulent time for the club, and has since improved its fortunes in the eyes of many fans.

One of his first moves was the surprise sacking of manager Sean O'Driscoll, but it would not be the first. In a busy time for the club, two more managers have parted ways with Nottingham Forest in the last 18 months.

Mr Al-Hasawi could not be reached for comment.
