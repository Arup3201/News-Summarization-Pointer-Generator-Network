Hero: Rachel Wheeler has raised more than $250,000 to help build new homes for the victims of the earthquake in Haiti

Rachel Wheeler has spent a large part of her life dedicated to the relief effort in the desperately poor Caribbean country of Haiti.

Her tin-rattling, pledge-inducing exploits have raised an incredible $250,000 which has been spent on building 27 homes on the earthquake-torn island.

All in all, not bad for a 12-year-old.

The families in the village of Leogane were so delighted with their new homes, they have baptised the housing development 'Rachelâ€™s Village'.

But her dream has not stopped there. She now wants to rebuild the local school, which was severely damaged in the 7.2-magnitude earthquake which devastated the country in early 2010, killing 316,000 and leaving 3million homeless.

'Life is life,' she told msnbc.com. 'You can't expect to change Haiti overnight with the snap of the fingers. You have to work at it. You have to make it happen.'

Three years ago, when she was just nine, the Florida youngster tagged along to a meeting about the charity work being carried out in Haiti by Food For The Poor.

There, she met Robin Mahfood, the head of the aid agency, who described the famine, disease and homelessness affecting the children so badly.

But just as her mother, Julie Wheeler, thought her daughter didn't understand what was being discussed, Rachel stood up on a chair in front of all the adults and pledged to build 12 homes.

What a relief: Nine-year-old Rachel is surrounded by grateful Haitians in Leogane. The families were so pleased with their new homes they have named the development 'Rachel's Village'

Humanitarian effort: Not content with just building homes, Rachel also delivers care packages to villagers on the earthquake-struck island

Rachel ran bake sales, passed the tin at homecoming games and sold homemade potholders at her Zion Lutheran School in Deerfield Beach, Florida, it was reported on msnbc.com.

Through her Facebook page and by word-of-mouth, a cherry farm in Washington heard about Rachel and sent along the proceeds from one of its season's harvest.

Another generous donation came from a family that regularly supports the overseas work of Food For The Poor.

Rachel, who has been to Haiti twice to see the abject poverty first-hand, has more than doubled her promise.

A family enters their new abode for the first time. Such was the alien environment of these houses, many of the residents had to be shown how to use a lock and key

Safe haven: Workers build the concrete, earthquake-proof homes in Leogane - 27 of which have been paid for with money raised by Rachel over the last three years

She spent $170,000 on brand-new earthquake-proof cement structures that shelter 27 families in Leogane, a small fishing village outside of the capital Port-au-Prince.

Many of the residents had spent their whole lives in makeshift homes and tents - Food For The Poor needed to give them instructions on how to use a lock and key on their new abodes.

Mr Mahfood said Haiti would be a 'completely different country' if everyone helped like Rachel had done.

'After nearly two years (since the earthquake), there is still so much great need. The children are experiencing an incredible amount of pressure.

'There aren't enough schools to go around and there is a lack of clean drinking water. People don't have the ability to look after their children properly or build their own home. There is so much unemployment it is unreal.'

Teamwork: The youngster with Robin Mahfood, the head of aid agency Food For The Poor, whom she met at the meeting in Florida three years ago which encouraged her to help out

Determined: Rachel ran bake sales and encouraged businesses to donate money to make her promise a reality

Rachel has about half of the money needed to re-build the Reap de Morel school in Leogane, where 200 students learn in classrooms that have no walls, a patched tin roof and dirt floors.

Classrooms are partitioned by bed sheets. The school 'library' is a simple wooden table displaying no more than 30 tattered books. Each child owns just a single pencil and notebook.

Food For The Poor has worked in Haiti for 25 years. The charity runs hundreds of food pantries that feed more than 400,000 people daily and supports dozens of free health clinics.

Many young Haitians suffer from deadly diseases such as cholera, which has killed more than 6,200 Haitians.
