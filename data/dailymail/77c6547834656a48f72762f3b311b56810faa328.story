The number tickets has doubled since 2009, leading to claims town hall chiefs are targeting drivers to make up money lost by budget cuts.

The AA’s Paul Watters told the Daily Mirror: 'Councils say they don’t profit from tickets but many do and there’s a temptation to increase fines.

'They should make spaces available in return.'
