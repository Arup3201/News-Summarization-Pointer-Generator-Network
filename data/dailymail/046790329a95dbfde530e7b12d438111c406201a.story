The Bloods street gang has threatened to kill more Jersey City police and 'not stop until the National Guard is called out' following the death of a man who shot dead a rookie cop, it has been reported.

Police are reportedly being warned of 'retaliatory action' from the gang in the aftermath of the death of Lawrence Campbell who was shot dead by police after he killed rookie officer Melvin Santiago.

A senior law enforcement official told The New York Post the gang had threatened to 'kill a Jersey City cop and not stop until the National Guard is called out.'

An internal Port Authority advisory, obtained by The Post, read: 'New Jersey State Police has received credible information from the Jersey City Police Department about specific threats toward Jersey City police officers and law enforcement.

'The United Blood Nation may take retaliatory action against police officers.'

It is not known whether Campbell was a member of the gang.

A law enforcement source also told the paper a statewide alert had been issued following three shootings involving police in the city.

Santiago was ambushed on Sunday as he responded to an armed robbery call at an all-night Walgreen's, authorities said. Other officers returned fire, killing Lawrence Campbell, 27.

Angelique Campbell, Campbell's widow, said she doesn't plan to restore a memorial to him that went up in their neighborhood but was taken down by Tuesday morning.

She had told News 12 New Jersey on Sunday that she was sorry for Santiago's family but that her husband should have killed more officers if they were planning to kill him. She later apologized for the comments.

'Both families are hurt. Let this cop be laid to rest peacefully. Let Lawrence be put to rest peacefully. That's it,' Angelique Campbell told The Associated Press on Tuesday.

'There's no back-and-forth. I don't want to argue with no cops, I don't want to fight with no cops. I just want to put him in the ground, he's gone, that's it.'

She said that Campbell had slipped back into an old drug habit over the past couple of weeks and 'got back with the wrong crowd.'

Authorities in Jersey City, already 
on edge following the ambush-killing over the weekend, said an officer 
shot a man Tuesday morning who authorities say had attacked him and his 
partner with a sharpened fence post.

The
 man, whose name was not released, was taken to a hospital and was 
expected to undergo surgery for non-life-threatening injuries, the 
prosecutor's office said. The police officers were also being treated.

West District Commander Capt. Michael J. Kelly said yesterday's shooting was not related to officers being in a heightened state of alert in the wake of Santiago's killing.

'Our officers are always in a high-alert state. That's part of our profession. It's a dangerous profession,' he said.

Kelly said condolences have been pouring in from departments across the region. He described Santiago as a quiet, serious young man who had dreamed of being a police officer since childhood and who had just started to hit his stride after less than a year on the job.

According to a preliminary investigation of Tuesday's shooting, two officers with the emergency services unit saw the 25-year-old man at about 2:30am and ordered him to drop the fence post, the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office said in a statement.

Authorities said the man threw the post through a passenger-side window of the emergency services truck, hitting an officer in the head. The man then reached through the window and grabbed the officer's rifle, authorities said. The two struggled for the rifle, which discharged through the vehicle's door and struck the man, officials said.

The officers exited the vehicle and ordered the man to the ground. One officer opened fire, striking the man, after authorities said the man refused to show his hands and hid a hand in his waistband.
