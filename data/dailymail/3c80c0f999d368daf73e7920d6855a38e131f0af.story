Andy Murray lost to Novak Djokovic after a well-fought battle at the Australian Open court earlier today.

The Scotsman may have missed out on the trophy but his fiancée Kim Sears, 27, was on hand to console the tennis champ while Novak celebrated his triumph alone as wife Jelena, 28, remained at home in Monte Carlo, with their three-month old son.

It’s just the latest on-court meeting between Andy and Novak and as Murray prepares to fly home, we examine how their off-court partners– who share seemingly identical tanned good looks, perfect hair and sparkling engagement rings – match up.

Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic have fought a close battle throughout their careers. Their partners Jelena Djokovic and Kim Sears are equally matched. FEMAIL looks at the Tennis WAGs.

Andy's loyal fiancee Kim is attracted even more attention courtside today than usual with her statement sweater and long golden locks, a position usually mirrored by Novak's wife Jelena, 28, were she not needed at home to babysit their young child.

The two women share many traits - they are both known for their outlandish support of their partners in the bleachers and  the press love to follow their fashion choices at every competition. 

The ladies are also both huge dog lovers, close to their family and place an emphasis on maintaining  interests outside of their famous partner's sporting commitments. 

Both tennis stars have also widely credited their WAGs for keeping their feet on the ground in what is an extremely nomadic and fraught career path. 

So FEMAIL put the two women head-to-head, to see who wins the TWAG trophy (the cup that REALLY matters):

Courtside manner: 

Kim and Jelena both find it impossible to keep a poker face when watching their partners battle it out on the tennis court. 

The women regularly appear on the brink of tears or react angrily to the decisions made by the umpire. 

Jelena once said of her inability to control her emotions during competitions: 'You can get very passionate when watching your boyfriend from the players' box. 

'We just want them to be happy. You don't want to see them in pain. If they are not happy, neither are you.'

Just last week, Kim was caught on camera mouthing 'F*****g have that, you Czech flash f***' at the Australian Open last week to Andy's opponent Tomas Berdych..

Relationship Status: 

Andy Murray proposed to his girlfriend of eight years last autumn with a three-carat diamond ring said to be worth around £200,000.

The couple have already been living together in a mansion in Oxshoot, Surrey, for more than three years.

Childhood sweethearts Jelena and Novak married last July in the grounds of Montenegro's exclusive Aman Sveti Stefan resort. 

Jelena, who was pregnant at the time with the couple's first child, wore a dressed designed by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen. 

The couple have since welcomed their son Stefan into the world, in October last year, which is the reason that Jelena is missing from her usual court-side spot at this year's Australian Open.

Dog points:

Both Jelena and Kim are animal  lovers, but Kim definitely takes the doggy biscuit in this leg of the competition. 

Jelena and Novak dote so heavily on their two poodles Pierre and Tesla, regularly taking them away on holiday together and sharing their antics on instagram. 

But Kim is so devoted to her two border terriers, Rusty and Maggie May, that they inspired her business - Kim Sears, Brushes And Paws, where she paints portraits of people's pet dogs.

Hair fame: 

Kim Sears fans envy the 27-year-old as much for her long bouncy locks as for her money-can't-buy courtside seats. 

The golden barnet is now so well-known that it has spawned a twitter handle of it's own - Kim Sears Hair, which describes itself as: 'I'm fabulous. I am the gorgeous mane you all love.'

Jelena's honey-coloured tresses have reached almost the same level of stardom in her home country of Serbia, with fashion bloggers regularly commenting on her unruffled appearance during stressful matches.

Career: 

In the early days of her relationship with Novak, Jelena was a successful model, starring in several high profile campaigns, including Figleaves (pictured above). 

But Jelena is just as much brains as beauty - she graduated from university in Milan with a Masters degree and is now working the director's of the Novak Foundation, which invests in pre-school education in Serbia. 

After graduating from Sussex university, Kim Sears struggled to find a her ideal job for a couple of years but finally settled on the art world. 

She has established herself as a very successful painter of pet portraits and is commissioned by people from all over the world through her website, Brushes And Paws.

Fashion credentials: 

Kim and Jelena both have the ace card in the fashion stakes - each woman has been photographed FROW with none other than Anna Wintour. 

Jelena was snapped deep in conversation with the Vogue editor at the Ralph Lauren SS14 show in September 2013, while Andy and Kim were given the coveted spot next to the taste-maker at the Burberry Prorsum show in September 2012.
