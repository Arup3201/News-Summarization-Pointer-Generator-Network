Winter has finally arrived Down Under, and it is certainly here with a vengeance.

Overnight the weather bureau issued a severe weather warning for damaging winds and blizzards all across New South Wales, which were expected to hit the Hunter region, Illawarra, South Coast, Central Tablelands, Southern Tablelands, South West Slopes, and the Snowy Mountains.

However, some good came from the cold front as ski fields across New South Wales and Victoria saw their first big dump of the snow season, which meant Thredbo, which is 500 kilometres south of Sydney, and Mount Hotham in Victoria, both had over 50 centimetres of snow.

Michael Collins, spokesperson for Thredbo told the MailOnline with school holidays coming up, the season is almost in full swing for them.

'But then there's a fairly significant cold front expected on Saturday with snow expected all the way down the Snowy Mountains.'

Wind speeds of up to 110km/hour in the Sydney and the Hunter Valley regions could shake things up on Tuesday afternoon, and these gale-force winds are expected to peak around 4pm.

The NSW State Emergency Service, who has already received 51 calls, have warned residents that 'there is potential for some damage' and are urging people to take precautions.

Meanwhile, heavy snow in the Blue Mountains hasn't caused any road closures, but the SES is keeping a close eye on the area.

The cause of the sudden change in weather is a cold which front crossed southeast NSW late yesterday, and an intense low pressure system near Tasmania which is expected to move east/northeast through Bass Strait today further intensifying the westerly winds over eastern NSW.
