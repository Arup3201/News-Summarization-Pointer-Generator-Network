The husband of an Oregon barista who disappeared en route to work earlier this week sobbed uncontrollably during Thursday’s press conference and was hardly able to utter a word as the missing woman’s mother begged for her daughter’s safe return.

‘It hurts to breathe right now,’ Lorilei Ritmiller told reporters while speaking of 21-year-old Whitney Heichel. ‘But we just want to find her and we're not going to stop.’

Heichel was reported missing by her husband, Clint Heichel, after she failed to show for her 7am shift at a Starbucks in the Portland suburb of Gresham. The drive from her apartment complex to the coffee shop takes less than five minutes.

Just hours after Thursday’s emotional press conference, children playing in an apartment complex several miles away from Heichel’s home found what is believed to be the missing woman’s cell phone.

Parents of one of the children told KATU that the device was spotted in bushes outside the Troutdale Terrace Apartments Thursday evening. The family said the phone had a screensaver of a picture of Heichel and text messages from her relatives asking if she was okay.

‘I was pretty shocked. I mean I knew right away ... I recognized the face,’ April Fletcher, the mother of one the girls, told ABC News.

The apartment complex is about four miles away from Heichel's home in Gresham. Police have not confirmed whether the phone belongs to Heichel.

Investigators said Heichel's ATM card was used at a Troutdale gas station at 9.14 am. Two hours later, her sport utility vehicle was found in the Wal-Mart parking lot in Wood Village with the passenger side window smashed.

Gresham police said at a press conference Thursday that they have interviewed the Troutdale gas station attendant, examined surveillance video and canvassed the neighborhood where Heichel lives.

Lt. Claudio Grandjean declined to say if Heichel was seen after 7am, or to say who may have been driving her SUV.

Police said they recovered potential evidence during searches of Dodge Park and Larch Mountain, remote, forested places east of Gresham where they believe the SUV was Tuesday morning.

‘There has been property recovered at different locations, but we can't positively say that that property is related to this,’ Police Chief Craig Junginger said.

Ritmiller said her daughter's nickname within the family is ‘Mama,’ because she's always been like a second mother to everybody, including her six siblings.

Ritmiller added that her daughter is a hard worker, a devoted Jehovah's Witness with a ‘heart as big as the sun,’ and her greatest hope is to have children of her own.

Desperate plea: While Clint Heichel, left, was too overcome with emotion to speak to reporters, her mother, right, begged for the 21-year-old's safe return and said that her family is not going to stop until she's found

‘She's wanted to be a mama since she was two years old and I brought her sister home,’ she said. ‘That was just her biggest hope, to have babies.’

Grandjean said police received 25 phone tips Wednesday and another 21 overnight. Two dozen detectives have been assigned to the case that has been classified as a suspicious disappearance.

Though he acknowledged that the first 48 hours are very important in a missing-person case, he stressed that the case is far from cold.

‘The leads and the evidence we've gathered have not gone cold, and so we continue to push forward until we find Whitney,’ he said.

Heichel left her apartment, which she shares with her husband, in Gresham, Oregon at 6.45am on Tuesday for a 7am shift but failed to turn up to work.

Six hours later, her SUV was found with a smashed window in a Walmart parking lot four miles from her home - and police learned it had been seen at a gas station in the hours in between.

Friends said that a gas station attendant claimed the vehicle had been driven by a man, who was acting 'suspicious and hurried', as Heichel sat in the passenger seat.

Her husband, Clint Heichel, told Fox 12 that he learned of his wife's disappearance when her manager at Starbucks called to say she had not arrived for her shift.

'She got dressed this morning, normal everything. Kissed me goodbye, said goodbye,' he said on Tuesday.

'(At)
about 8:15 her boss called me and said, "Hey, I was just curious, did 
Whitney decide to be sick or not feeling well? Have you seen her or 
talked to her?"' he told KATU.

Mr Heichel tried calling and texting her, but she did not respond.

Worried, he drove to her parents' home 
and then to a hospital in the area, as well as calling family and 
friends to see if anyone knew of her whereabouts.

When they could provide no further 
information, he called police to report her missing at 9.56am, and 
friends and family began distributing flyers and searching for her.

Detectives learned that her vehicle, a black 1999 Ford Explorer, was seen and her ATM card was used at a gas station three miles from her home at 9.14am.

Her
missing poster claims an attendant said she was in the passenger seat next to a man, who was 'acting suspicious and hurried'. It adds that he was driving the car and 
bought a small amount of gas, but police could not confirm this.

Concerns: Police confirmed that her SUV was seen at a gas station before the vehicle was found in a car park

At 1pm, family and friends looking for
Heichel found her vehicle, with the passenger window smashed, at a Walmart in Wood Village, around four miles from her home.

It appeared as if someone had rummaged through the car, according to her missing poster.

'The passenger side window was busted
out, the backseats were down, there was mud on her tires, which it 
wasn't that way the night before,' Clint Heichel said.

'It just is weird that we found her truck, completely off the path that she would take to go to work.'

He added: 'Anyone who has a loved one or is 
married knows if your spouse goes missing and there's no word... I don't 
know what to say, I don't know what to think, I don't know what to do.'

Details: Family and friends have been handing out flyers in the area in the hopes of gathering information

Gresham police said that there is surveillance
video showing the SUV at the gas station, but the video 
is poor quality and detectives are unable to see who is driving the car.

Police have called her disappearance suspicious and continue to follow leads, Sgt. Claudio Grandjean said.

Family and friends continue to search for the young woman, setting up Facebook groups and handing out fliers across the area.
