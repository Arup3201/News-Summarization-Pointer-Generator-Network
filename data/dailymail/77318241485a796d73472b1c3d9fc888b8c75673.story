A New England Patriots locker room attendant who allegedly tried to introduce an 'unapproved' ball into last month's AFC Championship Game at the center of the 'deflate-gate' scandal has now been named and pictured for the first time. 

An investigation by ESPN identified the attendant who was assigned to the officials' locker room as 48-year-old Jim McNally.

Mr McNally has been interviewed by the lawyer who is looking into the allegations the Patriots intentionally used under-inflated footballs.

It's believed McNally has been in charge of the officials' locker room at Gillette Stadium, which hosted the 2015 AFC Championship Game January 18. The Patriots, led by Tom Brady (pictured), beat the Indianapolis Colts

Accused of tampering: New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is fresh off a big Super Bowl win. Will favorable new Deflate-gate details help bolster his already high spirits?

 

The Patriots worker who became the focus of an NFL investigation after footage showed him carrying game balls into a room before he took them to the field was an elderly gentleman.

The room he entered with the balls was a bathroom and he was there for 98 seconds.

Both Tom Brady and coach Bill Belichick have adamantly denied any involvement.

Eleven of the 12 'Deflate-gate balls' were under-inflated, though only one was two pounds below the required PSI of 12.5 while the others were below by only a small amount.

The investigation is ongoing. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said Friday that 'we have made no judgments.'

Now a separate investigation by ESPN is alleging that a locker room attendant was involved in attempted to have an 'unapproved ball' put into play on the field.

As soon as the move was noticed, the NFLs vice president of game operations was notified.

It's believed McNally has been in charge of the officials' locker room at Gillette Stadium for the last seven years and has worked Patriots games for even longer.

The ESPN investigation suggested that McNally tried to give an unapproved football to an alternate official who was in charge of the special-teams footballs. 

The growing storm over the team's use of illegal balls, which is being referred to as 'deflate-gate,' dominated the buildup to the February 1st Super Bowl.

Under NFL rules, game balls must be inflated to between 12.5 and 13.5 pounds per square inch and no alteration is allowed once they are approved.

Patriots quarterback Tom Brady threw three touchdown passes during that game in wet conditions where a firm grip on a slippery ball could have helped.

Both Brady and Patriots head coach Bill Belichick have professed innocence regarding the deflated ball issue and said they knew nothing about it until the following Monday, after the game.

Before every NFL game, footballs are inspected and measured by NFL officials in their locker room before they can be approved for in-game use.

NFL officials then place a special mark on each ball so that other officials are aware that it has been inspected and approved.

During the game in question, ESPN are alleging that Greg Yette, an official at the game became suspicious when he noticed that a football that McNally handed him did not have the proper markings on it.

What was even more alarming was the fact McNally was on the field trying hand him a ball.

Locker room attendants usually remain in the dressing room areas and it is rare for them to be assigned ball-handling duties.

McNally's alleged involvement in attempting to introduce an unapproved ball into the game caught the attention of the NFL's vice president of game operations, Mike Kensil, who was at the game and sitting in the press box.

What is unclear at this stage is McNally's likely motivation for attempting to introduce an impermissible football into the game.

Both the official, Yette, and McNally have refused to speak to the press about their specific roles and circumstances on the day.

It is also not known if McNally is the same locker room attendant who apparently went into a bathroom with a bag of footballs for 90 seconds before taking them out to the field before the start of the game. 

Patriots owner Robert Kraft said investigators spent three days at the team's facility during which they were given access to every full- and part-time employee they requested to speak with and every communication device that they wanted to search.

Of those balls, reports NFL.com, 10 were likely just slightly under-inflated while only one was a full two pounds per square inch below the 12.5PSI minimum.

New twist in Deflate-gate: An investigative report from ESPN tells of a locker room attendant who attempted to have an 'unapproved' football used during the game

Patriots coach Bill Belichick has attributed the 11 underinflated game balls to atmospheric conditions and has said the Patriots 'try to do everything right; we err on the side of caution.'

Team owner Robert Kraft, in a strong defense of his head coach and quarterback Tom Brady, said: 'I want to make it clear that I believe unconditionally that the New England Patriots have done nothing inappropriate in this process or are in violation of NFL rules.' 

As the NFL's investigation into 'deflate-gate' continues, the spotlight of suspicion remains firmly fixed on the Patriots with some fans even questioning why New England was allowed to play in the Super Bowl at all. 

But the Patriots are not stranger to controversy and have developed a reputation as a team not above a bit of skullduggery.

In 2007, coach Belichick was fined $500,000 and the Patriots lost a first-round draft pick after an investigation found New England had videotaped an opponent's signals on the sidelines in what became known as 'Spygate'.
