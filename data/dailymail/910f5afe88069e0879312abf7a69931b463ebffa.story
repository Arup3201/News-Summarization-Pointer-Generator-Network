A new website has been launched to allow university students to meet for casual sex and its designer claims it is being dominated by female Oxford students.

Tom Thurlow's 'shagatuni.com' encourages members to send each other saucy messages and meet up for no-strings-attached liaisons.

It allows users to post a Facebook-style profile which explicitly advertises what they are looking for in a sexual partner.

Website: 'Shag at Uni' has been set up by internet entrepreneur Tom Thurlow who says hundreds of women from Oxford University have joined

Mr Thurlow, who became well known after setting up a successful second-hand book business at 13, now claims the biggest uptake so far appears to have been from young women studying at Oxford University. He says statistics show a whopping 722 woman from Oxford signed up since the site launched in October.

But Oxford’s biter rivals Cambridge University prove to be the most prudish - with the lowest amount of members in the whole country.

'The site is aimed at 18-30s university students, college students and people who may be friends of students. We have seen a real boost from the Oxford students,' he said.

'I am not surprised. When I tour the country filming MTV Freshers the Oxford students are always the most wild.

'They are always uptight in the day but by night they were always the craziest. It doesn’t surprise me they have the highest proportion of women looking for sex.'

The seedy site advertises itself as a space for students to have sex without 'the strings attached with dating'.

Design: Users like these ones post a profile, similar to Facebook, which explicitly advertises what they are looking for in a no-strings-attached partner

It boasts 26,933 members with 18,400 men and 8,533 women signing up for membership since it went live two months ago.

Sex-crazed students aged 18-30 can create revealing profiles supplying potential suitors with descriptions of themselves and their sexual preferences.

Some of the academic members even include naked self portraits and explicit details of where and how they like to have sex.

One of Oxford’s academic elite described as 'voluptuous Sandra', 19, describes her interests as role playing, home-made adult movies and goes into detail about her favourite sex acts.

Anyone can join the site and users do not need a university email address or tie to a university institution to enter the site.

Mr Thurlow, who has never studied at University, said: 'At uni it is all night parties, partying on a Monday, Wednesday never mind the weekends.

'People don’t go to university anymore to learn, they just want to have a good time - and part of that is having lots of sex.

'I think the reason the site is so popular is that students don’t want commitment and they just want a casual lifestyle.

'The site is what it is, people hunting for sex and they can approach it however they want through the site.

'We offer all our members advice for meet-ups expressing how important it is to do the meet and greet in a public place.

'It is important that our online members are safe.'

Membership is a one off £5 for men and free for women giving users the chance to message each other, “wink” at each other and arrange to meet.

The National Union of Students said today that people should consider their sexual health if getting involved.

#University students sexual practice is entirely a personal choice. The main consideration for the NUS is of course "safety first" and safe sex information is available from most Students Unions,' a spokesman said.
