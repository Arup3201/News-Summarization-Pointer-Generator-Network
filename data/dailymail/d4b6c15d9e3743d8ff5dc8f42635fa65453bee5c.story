On September 12, 1989, Liverpool humiliated Crystal Palace with a record 9-0 thumping at Anfield in the old First Division. But the teams met again later in the season and this time, remarkably, Palace won a thrilling FA Cup semi-final at Villa Park, 4-3 after extra-time.

Liverpool went on to win their 18th league title while Palace lost the Cup final after a replay to Manchester United — giving Alex Ferguson his first major domestic honour in England.

As Palace take on Liverpool in the FA Cup fifth round at Selhurst Park on Saturday, Sportsmail talks to members of the Palace squad for their memories of that incredible season.

GEOFF THOMAS (Palace captain)

The league game at Anfield was a nightmare. The last few minutes were particularly torturous. We were 8-0 down and desperate not to let it slip into double figures. Ian Wright was running around crying tears of frustration. It was awful.

For us, a side that had just been promoted to the First Division, the match amounted to a real lesson; a crash course in playing football at the highest level.

Steve Nicol scored Liverpool’s ninth in the 90th minute. No time to score a 10th at least! But Steve Coppell told us we had embarrassed ourselves when we returned to the dressing room. Being a Liverpool lad it really hurt him. His family had been there for his first game at Anfield as a manager.

How the two sides lined up for both games in the 1989-90 season

There were freakish elements to the game. Every chance they had seemed to result in a goal. They had eight different scorers. I remember hitting the post when it was 0-0. But then I also remember putting a penalty in row Z when we were 6-0 down! As captain I was so angry, I just wanted to burst the net. I blasted it. Miles over. Had I just side-footed the ball softly towards Bruce Grobbelaar I reckon he would have let it in, he felt that sorry for us.

Those were the days when we still had a team bath and John Pemberton broke the ice. ‘I reckon they’ll do OK this season,’ he said, and we all had to duck under the water to keep the noise of our laughter from the manager.

It helped us recover. We drew 1-1 at Southampton in the next game before beating Nottingham Forest in our first game back at Selhurst Park. By the end of the season we stayed up comfortably, finishing 15th.

The only real casualty of that night at Anfield was our goalkeeper, Perry Suckling. I didn’t think he was to blame but Steve responded by spending £1million on Nigel Martyn.

Over the next seven months we learned to cope better with the demands of top-flight football. And Steve worked us really hard in training, to make sure we were fit enough to deal with Liverpool come that semi-final. We used to do these cross-country runs and hill repetition sessions in Coulsdon. The place was called Happy Valley, which was a little ironic given how unpleasant training could be.

Every Friday we’d play a north versus south game, which could be really competitive. The foreign lads were on our team. They were always close but the southerners weren’t shy in letting us know when they came out on top. Flash gits.

We went into the semi-final much more confident. Steve wanted us to keep it tight, frustrate them. They were pushing hard to win the championship and he said if we could limit them to a goal or two by half-time, we’d have a fighting chance. We went into the break 1-0 down. Going out for the second half one of the lads cried: ‘Come on, let’s make history’. That day was one of the best atmospheres I ever played in.

Before Kenny Dalglish had even taken his seat we equalised. 1-1. Pemberton burst down the right — he was really quick — and put in a great cross for Mark Bright. Then we scored from a set-piece to take the lead. Gary O’Reilly put us in front, only for Liverpool to score twice in two minutes with eight minutes left. One or two of our lads thought we were done but enough of us remained defiant. We felt we were finishing the stronger of the two sides and after Andy Gray equalised we hit the woodwork again before the game went to extra-time.

Of course, it was Alan Pardew who got the winner — 109 minutes. Great stuff. The lads were delighted for Pards. He was hugely popular in that dressing room. We had some good players but along with myself and Gray he gave the team its engine room. We were a close-knit bunch. Even today we remain in touch. Ian Wright and John Salako are supporting my charity bike rides this summer to raise money for Cure Leukaemia, the charity run by Charlie Craddock, the professor who saved my life.

As for Pards, I was delighted to see him become Palace manager. He’s a bit misunderstood. Some people mistake his self-confidence, which you need as a manager, for over-confidence.

Alan always believed in hard graft, honest endeavour. It was a quality of the Palace team that got to the FA Cup final that year.

It’s a reason why he’s one of the best English managers around today.

NIGEL MARTYN (Palace goalkeeper in the semi-final)

I can remember leaving the training ground the day before the match, when we went up to Birmingham. It wasn’t just the players, it was people from the training ground too.

We passed a church that had a sign that read: ‘With God all things are possible’. The lady who used to give us our lunches pointed it out.

We weren’t particularly religious, but maybe it was a sign.

On the day itself, Steve Coppell said if we kept it tight we’d have a chance because we had some fit guys. They were the footballers but we were very fit.

Ian Rush scored and we came in 1-0 down but we got an early goal and then made the mistake of going ahead with too long to go! They switched on and had a spell where they re-took the lead.

You had a sense that they thought that was where they belonged and I think they took their eye off it a bit.When you take your foot off the gas like that it’s hard to put your foot back down.

When Alan scored the winner it was difficult for me to celebrate. I’m inwardly celebrating but then that’s replaced by having to make sure we don’t concede.

That final 11 minutes? The longest 11 minutes of my career.

MARK BRIGHT (Scored for Palace in the semi-final)

After the 9-0 game, Ronnie Whelan asked Geoff Thomas: ‘Can I ask you a serious question? Do you train with a ball or do you just run?’

Fast-forward to later that season and the motorway is packed full of Palace supporters having just beaten Liverpool in the semi-final.

On the way back from Villa Park, I’m in a car with Ian Wright, who missed the game with injury. We come to a standstill because of the traffic and Wrighty is sitting out of the sunroof drinking champagne. Fans are running out of their cars to hug us. Wrighty had his leg in plaster but he was so happy because he had the chance to play in an FA Cup final.

Speaking about it I get goose pimples. At full-time, Andy Gray shouts in my ear: ‘We are going to play at Wembley!’

It’s magical. A unique feeling. When Alan scores the winner, I can’t explain to you how it feels. It’s inexplicable.

The pendulum kept swinging in the game. To play in it, you knew you were playing in a special game.

Just before the start of extra-time, the manager said to us: ‘This is your time, you have to grasp it. You’re fitter, younger and hungrier.’

And he was right, it was our day. During the final 10 minutes, I just kept asking the referee: ‘How long left?’

You’re just thinking to yourself: ‘No-one make a mistake.’ You try to block Wembley out, but you can’t help it.

One headline the next day read: ‘The best day’s TV since man stepped foot on the moon.’ Wow.
