It's Pancake Day today when many children will be having fun in the kitchen, mixing and frying batter and enjoying the fruits of their labours. 

But this family activity doesn't have to be limited to one day a year. Stroud schoolboy Tom Barlow-Kay started cooking when he was nine after being inspired by watching his parents whip up meals from scratch.

By the tender age of 12, he was crowned Junior MasterChef champion 2012, beating 32 other contestants and impressing judges with his delicious dishes.

Here's one I made earlier: Junior MasterChef champion and his zingy meatballs

Getting stuck in: Tom was inspired to take up cooking at the age of nine after watching his parents in the kitchen

Now Tom is keen to encourage children to get into the kitchen 
to have fun, learn about new foods and discover if, like him, they have a
 talent for cooking.

While many children love baking 
cookies and fairy cakes, Tom says children's culinary ventures don't have to be limited to creating sweet treats.

While making pancakes on Shrove Tuesday is a great place to start, Tom said there are a number of other dishes children can create with minimal fuss.

One of them is his 'Zingy Meatball' recipe which he created after being inspired by the film Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs 2.

He
 said: 'I love making new recipes and this is one other children can do 
with their parents at home. I served them with salsa and they love and 
taste great.'

Tom said one of his favourite things about cooking is watching people's reactions when they taste his food.

Fiona Hamilton-Fairley, founder of The Kids' Cookery School, said that getting children to help out in the kitchen is an excellent way to build their confidence in new skills and 
get them interested in healthy food.

She told MailOnline: 'Children are more likely to eat a dish or meal if they have had a 
hand in it, so let them help out in the kitchen even if it is only doing
 something small and not dangerous. Allow them to explore the 
ingredients and learn from them.'

Like Tom, Fiona said parents shouldn't feel limited to just baking with their little ones.

Don't just do it on Pancake Day: Getting children cooking and baking all year round is a great way to help them learn a new skill and learn about healthy eating (posed by models)

She recommends finding unusual fruit and 
vegetables at the supermarket and finding new ways to prepare and cook them to make healthy eating more appealing.

She said: 'Try not to always make the same 
thing and try and keep away from the very sweet things. Savoury dishes 
are just as much fun to prepare and make as sweet biscuits, cakes and 
desserts, and of course much healthier to eat.'

She also advises letting the child 'be creative in the kitchen and put their own 
stamp on the food'.

She explained: 'This makes them happy and empowers them to eat and 
explore food further.'

This was the case for Tom and now he hopes to be a full-time chef when he leaves school - watch out Jamie Oliver.
