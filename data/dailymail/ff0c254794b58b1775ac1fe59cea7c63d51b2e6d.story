Chief executive Marc Bolland (pictured with Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) will be forced out unless he can engineer a recovery, say analysts

Healthy food sales have helped rescue Marks & Spencer from a disastrous start to the year as the store’s fashion and general merchandise continues to decline.

The popularity of the ‘5:2 diet’, which requires followers to restrict what they eat two days a week, helped sales of the store’s Count on Us range, which offers meals at fewer than 400 calories.

These products enjoyed a rise of up to 65 per cent in the first three months of this year.

Overall, food sales were up by 4 per cent – which helped to off-set a 3.8 per cent fall on fashion and general merchandise.

The net effect was that total like-for-like sales excluding changes in store space were up 0.6 per cent in the 13 weeks to March 30.

However, fashion lines continue to disappoint younger women, who have defected to cheaper rivals such as Primark, Zara and H&M.

Fashion and merchandise have now shown annual falls for almost two years, leaving M&S at risk of losing its crown as Britain’s biggest fashion retailer, and even surrounded by rumours of a takeover.

City analysts say chief executive Marc Bolland, hired from supermarket chain Morrisons with a multi-million pound golden hello, will be forced out unless he can engineer a recovery.

M&S has drafted in former Debenhams and Jaeger boss Belinda Earl to revitalise womenswear – as well as a publicity campaign fronted by supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley – but it is still too early to judge Miss Earl’s impact on ranges, which are not due in stores until the summer.

By contrast, the food division has delivered more than three years of growth, with the most recent quarter benefiting from its best ever Easter week.

It now makes up 55 per cent of M&S sales, with clothing and merchandise at 45 per cent. Last year the chain took some £4.7billion through food tills and £4.2billion on fashion and home products.

The 5:2 weight-loss technique requires dieters to restrict themselves two non-consecutive days a week to 500 calories or 600 for men, and eat normally on the other five days. M&S dishes such as the 380-calorie Green Thai Curry and 340-calorie chilli bowl fit in with the regime, and saw a rise in sales of 65 per cent and 58 per cent respectively. There was also a 54 per cent rise in sales of packs of low-calorie vegetable stir fries.

Healthy meals product developer Elaine Kessler said: ‘We’re delighted with the impact on sales.’

Food sales were also bolstered by the fact M&S had no connection to the horsemeat scandal. The figures led to shares rising by 4 per cent in early trading yesterday. However, overall annual group profits are expected to fall for the second year in a row when M&S reports results later this spring.

It follows a grim 2011, when profits fell for the first time in three years, to £705.9million. James McGregor, of retail consultants Retail Remedy, said: ‘General merchandise is clearly still struggling but these numbers will buy Marc Bolland a few more months. Judgement day for him  will come later this year.’

Sales slunmp: Marks & Spencer said sales in its clothing and homeware division fell for the seventh straight quarter.
