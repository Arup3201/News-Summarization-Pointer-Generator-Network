Pulling a knife on this brave grandmother almost proved fatal for a suspected armed robber.

Ernestine Aldana was working behind the counter of her convenience store in Milwaukee when the man, wearing a dark hat and grey top, appeared to threaten her with a knife before grabbing the cash register.

But in dramatic CCTV footage released by the police, he is soon seen sprinting to the door in terror after the 48-year-old pulled out a gun and pointed at him.

Threatening: After pretending to try to purchase a bottle of drink the man pulled a knife out and waved it at grandmother Ernestine Aldana in her Milwaukee store

Cowering: The man quickly realises he has bitten off more than he can chew as she pulls out a knife and levels it at him

Terror: The man backs off in fear as she continues to point the weapon towards him

The man, who is being sought by police, had a lucky escape after Mrs Aldana revealed she had been prepared to pull the trigger.

'I shouldn't say this but I think was going to shoot the gun but he was already running away and once his back was turned I couldn't do it,' she told WISN.

'I mean I didn't think, I didn't remember what was being said. I took a step back and grabbed the gun and that was that.'

Escape: He heads for the door as the grandmother shows no sign of lowering the gun

Gone: He escapes with his life. Mrs Aldana later admitted she was prepared to shoot the man

Instinct: Mrs Aldana said the robbery was over so fast she barely had time to think

Mrs Aldana, who has run the store 
with her husband for two-and-a-half years, said her son had bought her 
the gun for her protection, and had taken her to a shooting range to 
teach her how to use it.

Milwaukee police said Thursday that an arrest had been made in the case after they released the surveillance video.

The 'Castle Doctrine' was passed in 
Wisconsin in 2011 giving home and business owners protection when using a
gun to defend their property, ABC news reports.
