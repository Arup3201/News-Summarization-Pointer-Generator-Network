A woman in police custody should never have been strip searched by four male officers, a watchdog has said.

The 22-year-old was arrested outside Supperclub in west London and taken to Chelsea police station where she was left naked in a cell for half an hour.

While she was locked up, there were CCTV cameras broadcasting her movements to the custody desk.

Arrest: The 22-year-old woman was detained outside Supperclub in west London because she was intoxicated

There was a female officer present, but 
the Independent Police Complaints Commission said that all officers 
should be of the same gender for such a search and the watchdog has now 
called for six police officers to face misconduct proceedings.

The clubber was 'intoxicated, distressed and running in and out of a road' when she was arrested.

Officers believed she was on drugs and might have illegal substances hidden in her clothing, the IPCC found.

IPCC Commissioner Derrick Campbell said: 'This incident caused a great deal of distress to the victim.

'I find it difficult to understand why police officers think they have the right to strip a young woman of all her clothes, leaving her naked for half an hour and then expose her to being filmed.

'I am sure, like the complainant, the public will want to understand how this was allowed to happen. I look forward to the misconduct process getting the answers that are needed.'

The woman was arrested outside Supperclub in March 2011.

The IPCC said that the police sergeant on
duty should face a charge of gross misconduct for failing to make a 
written record of the strip search or make sure that it was carried out 
in line with the rules.

Five constables should face misconduct proceedings for breaching the guidelines for searches, while another two should face 'management action', an internal measure.

One is accused of potentially discouraging the woman from getting legal advice by implying that she would have to stay at the police station for longer if she did so.

It is claimed that the other failed to investigate her claim that her drink was spiked at the club.

The woman complained about her treatment to Scotland Yard, which carried out its own investigation, but she was unhappy with the findings and so went to the IPCC.

Scotland Yard said it will hold disciplinary proceedings against the sergeant and the five search officers, but it is reviewing whether the remaining two constables should face management action.

A spokesman said: 'We agree with the recommendations of the IPCC and will be holding a gross misconduct hearing for the sergeant involved in this incident in due course.

'The five officers involved in the search will now face misconduct proceedings and we are still reviewing the recommendations that the remaining two officers should face management action.'
