It seems it's not just humans who appreciate a spectacular sunrise.

These playful Gelada Baboons wake up before daybreak and climb to the highest vantage point they can find to bask in the dawn sunshine of Ethiopia's Simien mountain range.

The Geladas, which are some of Africa's most sociable monkeys, were pictured by photographer Simone Sbaraglia, who followed the group as they got up early and climbed to the nearest peak to catch the the morning rays.

Photographer Simone Sbaraglia, 41, said that the best time to photograph the baboons was either as they came out of their nest in morning, or as they returned just before sunset

Gelada baboons are not actually baboons in a traditional sense - and are easily recognisable by the patches of hairless skin on their chests.

Due to a diet that consists primarily of grass the Geladas need large foraging grounds, with the heights of the Simien Mountains, which are more than 4,200 meters high, providing the perfect location.

Mr Sbaraglia, 41, spent three weeks following the group and said that over time the monkeys started to allow him to get up close and personal with them, as they gained his trust.

The photographer, from Rome, Italy, said that the best time to photograph the baboons was either as they came out of their nest in morning, or as they returned just before sunset. Both times allowed Simone to capture beautiful backdrops of the sun and surrounding mountains, he said.

Simone, who is a professor of photography and mathematics, said: 'I really enjoyed being close to Geladas and observing their behavior: the grooming, the babies playing and the occasional fights between males. 

'They like to spend the night on the cliffs to seek refuge from predators, so I used to wait for them to come out of their night nest before sunrise and then go back before sunset to wait for them to return. That is where I got the best pictures, showing the monkeys with the amazing backdrop of the Simien mountains.

'I was fascinated by the location that these primates live it. I think this is what makes them special, so I was especially interested in portraying their habitat together with their special features, such as the long fur and the 'bleeding heart' that they display on their chest.

'They are very special in that the live very high up on the mountains - more than 4200 meters above sea level. Furthermore, they feed exclusively on grass - no fruit, no insects like many other primates - so need a large foraging ground.

'They live in large groups with more than one leader. I find them extremely beautiful and fascinating with their fur and heart-shaped mark on the chest.

'They are generally not aggressive and oblivious to photographers and occasional visitors. I spent three weeks following the same group of monkeys from sunrise to sunset, so they grew accustomed to my presence and let me get very close to them.'
