Paranoia about the pervasive influence of the Red Menace in the first half of the 20th century led British spymasters to investigate the Scouting   movement because they feared Communist agents were trying to brainwash impressionable young minds, it has been revealed.

Espionage files released to mark the centenary of the First World War show that MI5 agents tapped phone calls between leading Communists and planned to   send an agent to an international Scouting jamboree.

They even looked into Bolshevik 'plots' to take control of certain Scout troops.

More than 150 files created during the period of the Great War, but often extending beyond it, have been digitised by the National Archives and released   to mark the conflict's centenary.

They include interrogation reports, letters, postcards and photos relating to individuals and groups under   surveillance.

One memo from the 175-page dossier asks what is known about the 'Red' boy Scout movement in Britain.  The answer, reports the Daily Telegraph, was apparently not satisfactory: 'We know nothing about the red boy Scout movement.'

What followed was series of intelligence investigations into the perceived threat. One reports details an incident at a jamboree on The Wirral, where   four men were arrested for distributing Communist literature.

Members of the public were furious, but the Scouts reportedly shielded the agitators and, demonstrating their fire-kindling schools, torched the pamphlets.

The files also contain details about the spy Mata Hari, who was covertly monitored by MI5

But MI5's fears were apparently not without merit. William Rust, secretary of the Young Communist League, claimed his organisation was 'penetrating the   Scouts.

Meanwhile, a Scout leader in erith, Kent, was approached by the 'Erith Soviet Scouncil' in the early 1920s and offered the command of the troop -   presumably an honour they thought he craved - if he accepted the top spot in their own organisation.

The USSR banned Scouting in 1922, creating a separate Young Pioneer organisation of the Soviet Union. The Pioneer Movement still exists in some fashion   in China, Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam, and Tajikistan.

Part of a wider security service personal file series held by the National Archives, based in Kew, south-west London, the files form part of its First   World War 100 programme of digitised releases.

The files contain details of spies around the world, including famous people like British nurse Edith Cavell, who saved soldiers in German-occupied   Belgium; Mata Hari, the notorious female spy and entertainer; Arthur Ransome, author of Swallows And Amazons, and American poet and author Ezra Pound.

They also contain intelligence reports and surveillance of organisations such as the Bolshevik Party and the British Communist Party, as well as files on   political figures from known fascists to communists and Russian leaders such as Leon Trotsky and Vladimir Lenin.

National Archives records specialist Dr Stephen Twigge said: 'The files in the National Archives' collection reveal the importance of the security   service in safeguarding the nation during the First World War.

'Now that we have made the files available online as part of our First World War 100 programme, people across the globe can discover the secret history   behind the war for themselves.'
