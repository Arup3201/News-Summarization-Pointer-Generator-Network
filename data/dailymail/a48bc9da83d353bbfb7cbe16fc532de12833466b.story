The High Court has found Sydney radio station 2Day FM broke the law by airing a royal prank call which saw two presenters mimic Queen and Prince Charles.

Djs Michael Christian and Mel Greig made the hoax call in 2012 to a London hospital, where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for severe morning sickness. The nurse who put through the call later took her own life.

The Australian Communications and Media Authority on Wednesday won its appeal against an earlier Federal Court decision, with the court finding the call breached New South Wales surveillance laws.

The High Court has found 2Day FM breached New South Wales surveillance laws, paving the way for possible penalties to be imposed on the station such as having their licence suspended or terminated

In its judgement, the High Court said 2Day FM did not obtain the consent of the hospital's staff to air the recording.  

The unanimous decision by the court paves the way for a possible penalty against the station, including being temporarily taken off air or even terminated, reports Mumbrella.

2 Day FM could also be subjected to 'enforceable undertakings to force future compliance, or further licence conditions.'

In the call, the two announcers phoned London's King Edward VII Hospital pretending to be the Queen and Prince of Wales and seeking information about the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge.

They managed to dupe nurse Jacintha Saldanha who transferred their call to another nurse who divulged private information about the Duchess' condition.

Soon after the hoax was publicised, Ms Saldanha committed suicide. 

Both Mr Christian and Ms Greig were devastated by the nurse's death, and apologised for making the call. 

Ms Greig flew herself to London hto make a statement to the court and apologise to Ms Saldanha's family.

ACMA sought to take action against the station for breaching a condition of its licence which stipulates that it would not use its broadcasting service in the commission of an offence.
