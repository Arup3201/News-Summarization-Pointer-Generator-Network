'Pregnant man' Thomas Beatie's divorce from his ex-wife is trapped in legal limbo while an Arizona judge decides if their marriage was ever valid in the first place because Thomas, who was born a woman, has given birth to three children.

The transgender made headlines four
 years ago when he became pregnant because his wife Nancy couldn't have children. The couple, who married in 2003, are now trying to get divorced and work out the custody issues for their three children, plus the division of property and spousal support.

However the family court judge assigned to his case, Douglas Gerlach, is questioning the 
legitimacy of the marriage, because after being legally declared male, 
Beatie performed that most female of miracles - child birth.

The validity of the Beatie's marriage now hangs in the balance, as same-sex marriage is forbidden in Arizona and the state doesn't recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states.

Beatie was born a woman, Tracy Lehuanani Lagondino, in 1974 in Oahu, Hawaii. After undergoing male-hormone therapy he was legally allowed to change his birth certificate and driver’s license to say he is a man. He was also legally allowed to get married as a man.

Judge Gerlach understands that, but as he wrote into the court record, 'In other words, it appears that, by any reasonable standard, (Beatie) was the biological mother of those children at the times they were born. As such, parties’ marriage was between a female and a person capable of giving birth, who later did so.'

He asked the Arizona Attorney General’s Office for an opinion as to whether this was a valid marriage or a same-sex - and consequently invalid - marriage, but they declined the invitation to get involved.

“I was surprised at the remarkable indifference I received,” Gerlach said in open court Friday. So it is up to him to make a decision that, however he rules, is likely to be taken to the Court of Appeals. Gerlach said he would reach a decision by early February.

Beatie has called the judge's decision 'frustrating'.

'I live my life, I know who I am and 
someone else's opinion, even though it is a Judge's opinion is not going
 to change that. I am Thomas, I am husband, I am father, I am a man, hear
 me roar,' he told Anderson Cooper last month.

Cooper pointed out that he could get the marriage annulled but Beatie, 
though recognizing it would be the easiest thing to do says: 'My 
marriage did happen and I was married to 
Nancy for almost ten years, we paid taxes, we bought and sold homes, we 
started a family together and I want that to be validated. It's being 
challenged right now so if I back down from it we all lose.'

His marriage to first wife Nancy reached a bitter end when footage of her appearing to violently attack her 
husband, mishandle their children and destroy their computer emerged.

He has previously claimed that Nancy was a violent alcoholic who would 
attack him in the night and once punched him in the crotch in front of 
the kids.

In May, a judge gave Beatie temporary full custody over the couple’s three children.

He
 said: 'It's been a process. We physically separated back in March when I
 filed for separation and there was a protective order but basically I 
didn't wear my wedding ring for a year prior to that.

'We
 were supposed to finalize the divorce back a couple of months ago and 
the judge is thinking it's out of jurisdiction and potentially could 
rule it as same sex marriage.'

Beatie has filed documents hoping to prove his marriage’s legitimacy, 
highlighting that both his U.S. passport and his Hawaii birth 
certificate list him as a man.

When
 he was in his 20s he began having testosterone injections, giving him 
facial hair, a lower voice and altering his sexual organs.

The
 couple met shortly after Beatie began taking the testosterone. Nancy is
 11 years older than him and has two teenage daughters, Amber and Jen, 
from a previous marriage.

But at the 
age of 28 she had a hysterectomy because of severe endometriosis - where
 cells from the lining of the womb are found elsewhere in the body - so 
she couldn’t have any more children.

Thomas had already had a mastectomy to remove his breasts, and hormone treatment that gave him an outwardly male appearance.

But he chose to keep his female sexual organs so the couple could have children.

They bought sperm from an anonymous donor and Beatie underwent artificial insemination.

He
 eventually fell pregnant with Susan in late 2007 and had his next two 
children in quickly after, as he only had a short window of not taking 
testosterone.

He posed for a famous picture in 2007 which displayed him as heavily pregnant but with facial hair.

He told Oprah on her show four years ago: 'I wanted to have a child one day. I didn't know how. It was just a dream.'

The
 couple has been open about their sex life, revealing on Oprah that the 
testosterone had enlarged Beatie's clitoris. It grew to a small penis, 
allowing him to have sex with his wife, he said.

In
 March, Beatie revealed he had filed for bankruptcy and was desperately 
seeking a job to get his family off welfare handouts and pay his 
$5,000-a-month mortgage.

Last month Beatie appeared on Anderson Live with his new girlfriend Amber and said that they had not ruled out having babies together.
