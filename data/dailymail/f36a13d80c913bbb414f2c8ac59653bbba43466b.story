A bride-to be had an unexpected surprise at her engagement party when she opened up her cake to find she had been sent a dessert in the shape of faeces.

Micaela Harris, 24, of Invercargill, New Zealand ordered an extra cake for her engagement party, but after a disagreement between her sister and the cake maker, the result left a bad taste.

The baker, Emma McDonald, is said to have become annoyed at Harris’s sister for not specifying what type of cake she wanted, and sent her a pile of ‘chocolate poo’ with a flag stuck in it, telling the party guests to ‘eat s***’.

'Congratulations on your engagement!': New Zealand baker Emma McDonald sent this unfriendly message to her customer after a disagreement

According to local media, Ms Harris’s 
sister had won a $50 voucher from Oh Cakes. The voucher, reduced to $30 
as Oh Cakes’s owner claims $20 was owed from a ‘separate business 
engagement’, was set to cover an engagement party cake for Ms Harris.

Ms
 McDonald, who runs Oh Cakes, claims Ms Harris’s sister ‘got what she 
deserved’ for not specifying what she wanted other than ‘chocolate’.

‘I
 have no regrets at all about what I did. I feel she got what she 
deserved,’ The Southland entrepreneur told the Herald on Sunday.

‘I 
don't make cakes as a business. It is just a hobby and I'm taking it all
 with good humour.’

Expectation vs Reality: When Ms Harris's sister ordered a 'chocolate cake' she probably meant something looking more like this one

After it
 was picked up, McDonald posted on Facebook: ‘Your (sic) left with a $30
 voucher and you want a cake still?? ok cool - give me some ideas?? oh 
wait you have none apart from wanting chocolate. I have a brilliant idea
 for your cake!!! - so here it is, your turd cake! Hope you learn your 
lesson.’

A text, claimed to 
be from Ms Harris’s sister, was also posted by Ms McDonald on her social
 network: ‘We r (sic) just at my sister's engagement and got your cake, 
we and every1 else is absolutely disgusted.’

The posts were later removed.

‘The
 cake was for an engagement party and this woman is not remorseful at 
all, which is disappointing,’ the family member told the New Zealand 
newspaper

‘It was wrapped up in a box, so it was done deliberately as a nasty surprise. It was a disgraceful thing to do.’
