An epileptic child was forced to sleep in a giant dog cage after her mother's application for a special bed was turned down by local authorities. 

Sadie Fenton Hunt, 10, has such severe disabilities she needs to be boxed in to her bed every night to stop her crawling out and hurting herself. 

When her mother moved from Northumberland to Edinburgh to be near her parents earlier this year, she assumed the council would pay for the specialised piece of furniture. 

Sadie Fenton Hunt had to sleep surrounded by dog caging after her mother's bid for a special bed to keep her from crawling out at night and hurting herself was turned down 

Ms Fenton was forced to think on her feet when the application was turned down. She used some furniture to steady the caging 

But Ms Fenton was 'totally stunned' when she learned her daughter didn't meet NHS Lothian's criteria, and was forced to put dog caging around a mattress on the floor to keep Sadie safe at night. 

After sharing photographs of her daughter, who has a mental age of around 18 months, the mother-of-two has been contacted again by the council which has agreed to pay for a new bed. 

'Sadie is severely disabled, she's in a special school and has limited ability and lots of learning needs. 

'Mentally, she is the age of an 18-month-old so really she is just like a big toddler.

'We moved back to Edinburgh to be near my parents so they could help as I'm a single mother so it has been difficult. 

'But I was totally stunned when I learned we couldn't get the same bed we'd had before. I was really upset'. 

The 41-year-old resorted to caging Sadie's mattress in to keep her from crawling out and hurting herself during the night. 

Sadie has a mental age of around 18 months and can seriously hurt herself if she crawls out of bed at night

A bed, similar to this one, has been paid for by Edinburgh City Council and will be delivered to Sadie immediately 

'Sadie hasn't ever been on holiday, she'd only ever slept in a bed like that. We need it, we all need to sleep - she does, I do and her brother does as well. 

'I just had to think outside the box but to be honest experts do say when dealing with children with special needs, especially as they get older, sometimes dog equipment is best. 

'If you think about stair gates, the children's ones are too small for Sadie but one for a tall dog isn't.' 

In response to the photograph of Sadie sleeping on the floor, Edinburgh City Council said it would pay for the child to get a new bed. 

'We have urgently reviewed Sadie’s case and are taking immediate action. We are going to provide the family with a new bed which will meet her current and future needs. 

'We would like to apologise to Sadie and her family for any upset caused.'
