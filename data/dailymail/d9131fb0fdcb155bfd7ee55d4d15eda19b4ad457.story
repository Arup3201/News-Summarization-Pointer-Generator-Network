Six schoolchildren had to be rushed to hospital this morning after taking legal highs before school.

The alarm was raised at Lealands High School, in Luton, after a pupil collapsed and was taken to the medical centre when he took an unknown legal high.

Ambulances were called at just after 8.30am but, before they arrived, another two pupils had fainted while three more began to complain of feeling dizzy and nauseous. All the teenagers were then rushed to the nearby Luton and Dunstable Hospital.

Police confirmed the six students had all taken the same legal high this morning. But a parent claimed that even the teenagers themselves weren't sure exactly what substance they took.

One female pupil at the school, who would not be named, said: 'A year seven boy was given it by a year nine student but he went into the atrium and collapsed and the doors were closed.

'After he fainted the other pupils who took it started getting ill too. An ambulance arrived in period one and helped them.'

Her mother, who also has another teenage daughter at the school, blamed the incident of falling discipline standards at the school.

She said: 'Since the new headteacher took over the school has got a lot worse. The children at the school frequently get into a lot of trouble.

Three pupils collapsed and another three became dizzy after taking an unknown legal high this morning (pictured is mephedrone, a legal high, known as meow meow, white magic, drone, bubble and MCAT, which was legal until April 2010)

'This probably happened at the breakfast club which the school holds before classes start.

'They are allowed to do what they want and go outside if they want to so they probably had it then.' 

A spokesman for the East of England Ambulance service said the pupils, a mixture of boys and girls, were all discharged from hospital this afternoon.

'We treated six patients who were unwell,' he added. 'Three of them had collapsed and the other three were feeling dizzy.'

Detective Sergeant Sandra Evans said police were called 'following concern for the health of several pupils who had fallen unwell after taking what was believed to be a 'legal high' before coming to school.

'Six students, all in their teens, were taken to the Luton and Dunstable Hospital suffering from a variety of symptoms and were later discharged,' she added.

'We'd like to take this opportunity to remind people that just because a substance is marketed as being 'legal', it does not mean it is safe.

'It's not always clear what ingredients such substances are made up of, or what effect it is likely to have on you.'

Police said this was the first report of any incident involving legal highs at the school and are offering to work with them to educate pupils on the dangers of the drugs. 

Headteacher John Burridge said all pupils had been offered support after the incident. 

He said: 'Before arriving at school six students from different year groups appear to have become very unwell. 

'We first became aware of this when one of these students attended the medical room on arrival at school. We immediately contacted the ambulance service and then it emerged that other students were suffering similar symptoms. The pupils were taken to the Luton and Dunstable Hospital for further assessment and care.

'At this stage we are not certain of the cause of their symptoms. We have advised all pupils about the incident and have offered support if they have any concerns, however we are not aware that any other students are affected.

'Our absolute primary concern at this stage is the welfare and wellbeing of the students who are now in the hands of medical professionals.'

'All pupils were discharged earlier today in the care of their parents.'

Drugs experts have warned that deaths linked to ‘legal highs’ could overtake those linked to heroin by 2016.

Deaths increased eightfold, rising from 12 in 2009 to 97 in 2012, according to figures from Centre for Social Justice who claim the UK has the highest rate of legal highs use among young people in Europe.

Only last August, father-of-three Michael McKay, 33, from Arbroath, Angus, passed away at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee following a five-month addiction to new psychoactive substances (NPS), which caused him severe heart problems.

In 2013, Adam Hunt, 18, died four days after taking the psychoactive substance AMT at his home in Southampton, Hampshire, after purchasing it from a website. 

In the same year, keen sportsman Jimmy Guichard, 20, suffered a heart attack and severe brain damage within hours of taking one of the herbal substances.

The soaring death toll led to ministers calling the rise in the use of legal highs a 'national emergency'.

Currently drug laws in Europe and North America only ban the use and sale of specific substances.

This means new compounds developed by chemists can be sold without fear of prosecution until they are added to the list of controlled substances.

Mephedrone, created by Dr Z and sold over the internet as plant food, caused at least one death and has been implicated in at least 13 others. 

The drug became popular among clubbers in 2007 as a more easily available - and legal - replacement for ecstasy. 

Mephedrone's popularity gave rise to a whole new market for legal highs sold over the internet.

When the substance was finally banned in 2010, a range of other novel synthesised drugs had sprung up to take its place.

They include psychoactive substances (NPS) and 6-APB, known commonly as Benzo Fury.

Those attempts have now turned into a cat and mouse game with legislators, with chemists synthesising new substances faster them Parliament can ban them, spawning a whole industry to feed Britain's hunger for mind-altering substances.

However, unlike drugs which have been around for years and for which risks are generally well known, the long term - and indeed short term - risks many of these new substances are still a mystery.
