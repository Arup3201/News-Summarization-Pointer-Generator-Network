The Duchess of Cambridge better watch out, there's another Royal keen to steal her style crown.

But while Kate prefers thrifty high street style, Princess Beatrice has been channeling a high fashion look of late.

Last night, the 25-year-old made sure all eyes were on her as she was seen leaving trendy new Marylebone eatery, the Chiltern Firehouse.

High fashion: Princess Beatrice, 25, was seen leaving the trendy Chiltern Firehouse last night in a stylish ensemble complete with £2,000 arm candy

Princess Bea looked effortlessly chic - a look she has carefully mastered - in a £40 ASOS boucle jacket with leather shoulders, black mini skirt and her favourite Kurt Geiger studded pumps.

She complemented her outfit with a black Celine handbag. The arm candy, which costs around £2,000, is loved by the likes of Kim Kardashian, Coleen Rooney and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and has fast become the most coveted tote amongst the fash pack. 

Beatrice had been enjoying an evening at the Chiltern Firehouse - a new-found favourite haunt of the A-list set.

Earlier this week, Kate Moss and Lily Allen were seen dining at the restaurant, which is headed up by top chef Nuno Mendes, while Kate took Cara Delevingne there last week.

Good taste: Bea dined at the Chiltern Firehouse - frequented earlier this week by Kate Moss

The restaurant is within the hotel of the same name by American hotelier André Balazs.

The menu is fairly low-key, offering American dishes such as crab doughnuts, fried chicken with bacon infused aioli, as well as maple-glazed salmon and chargrilled Iberico pork.

Last week, Princess Beatrice stole the show at the launch of a new fashion blog in London store Fortnum & Mason with a very classy monochromatic ensemble.

She wore a tailored black
 blouse which cinched at her waist and paired it with a geometrically 
patterned black and white mini skirt as she posed with friend Poppy Delevingne.
