Saved: The eight-month old female harbor seal, known as Pup 49, had to have a flipper amputated to save her life

She may have one less flipper - but this young seal has plenty to smile about after her life was saved by vets following a brutal attack.

The eight-month-old, known as Pup 49, was found badly injured on a Massachusetts beach following a fight with another seal.

Her horrific injuries included deep cuts all over her body which became seriously infected.

She is now getting used to her new life with one less rear flipper at the Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut after vets were forced to remove one to stop the infection spreading through her body.

The plucky pup's strength has nearly returned but she is still coming to terms with the amputation - occasionally swimming to the platform's edge and trying to haul herself from the water, ABC news reports.

Workers at the aquarium have even installed a special ramp to help the pup get out of her pool.

But things could have turned out very differently for the inquisitive creature, after she was left on the brink of death following a battle with an older seal off the New England coast.

She was found stranded and emaciated in PlymouthÂ  Massachusetts last July.

The seal, which was named Pup 49 after the ID number she was given when rescued, was also struggling to breath properly due to the impact of her wounds and infection.

The decision to amputate her flipper was made after vets found the infection had spread to her bones - putting her life in danger.

Healing: Experts at the aquarium have been encouraged by her progress as she has adapted her swimming to suit her disability

Flippers play an essential role in helping seals guide themselves through the ocean - so losing one was never going to be easy for the young pup.

But experts at the aquarium have been encouraged by her progress as she has adapted her swimming to suit her disability.

However, the seal's fate remains uncertain after officials from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said she could not be released back into the wild due to concerns about her ability to hunt properly, ABC News reports.
