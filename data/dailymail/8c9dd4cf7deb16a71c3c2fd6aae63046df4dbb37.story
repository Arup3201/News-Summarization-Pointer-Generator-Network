Police in Tampa, Florida have released footage of the dramatic rescue of a pilot from a burning aircraft last Thursday night.

Footage of the rescue, caught on infrared camera, shows an officer extinguishing the engine fire before pulling the pilot from the cockpit.

Two officers in a Tampa Police Department helicopter on routine patrol, Dave Dennison and Brian Gentry, heard the pilot's mayday calls and headed towards him at Tampa International Airport, arriving in time to witness the plane crash-land.

Infrared footage: The police helicopter's camera recorded the plane falling from the sky and landing in a ditch at the Tampa Airport

Rescue: The police landed their helicopter near the burning wreck of the small Cessna aircraft

Tampa International Airport received the call from a pilot in distress with a report of low engine oil at 11:44pm.

Seconds
 later he radioed through to air traffic controllers: 'Iâ€™m running a 
little bit rough here. I should be able to make it though.'

Four minutes later, officers Gentry and Dennison saw the plane crash next to a retention pond at the airport west of runway 19R and came in to land nearby.

The footage depicts an officer running towards the burning plane to investigate the situation.

He runs back towards the helicopter then returns to the plane with a fire extinguisher, putting out the flames before throwing the extinguisher away and running around to the cockpit.

Brave: Officer Brian Gentry runs towards the plane to rescue the pilot

Quick action: He extinguished the fire before cutting the pilot from his safety harness and dragging him from the wreck

Saved: Gentry drags the pilot a safe distance from the plane and administers first aid until paramedics arrive

He pulls the unconscious pilot out of 
the plane after cutting him out of his safety harness, then drags him a 
safe distance from the wreckage.

According to the Tampa Bay Times, the officer who can be seen pulling the unconscious pilot from the plane and extinguishing the engine fire is Gentry.

A police spokesman told the Tampa Bay
 Times that the pilot broke his ankle and may have internal injuries but
 is in a stable condition.

A witness told WTSP that the plane was already on fire before it crashed.

'I saw a plane coming parallel with 
Hillsborough and I knew it wasn't right. And I saw it was on fire. I'm 
surprised he didn't hit the [Veterans Expressway], as low as he was," 
Mark Lieberstein said.

ABC Action News reports that the pilot was rushed to hospital by Tampa Fire Rescue which also attended the scene.

The small Cessna 210N is registered to AirNet Systems based in Columbus, Ohio and was en route to Tampa from Valdosta, Georgia.

Wreckage: The plane is still at the crash-site as authorities investigate the incident

The company's website says that the company specializes in delivering 'time-critical small packages.'

The wreckage of the plane remains at the crashsite today, partially obscured by a tarp.

The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash.
