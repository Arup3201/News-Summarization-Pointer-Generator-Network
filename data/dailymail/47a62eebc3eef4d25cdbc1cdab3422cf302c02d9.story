It seems almost an oxymoron: a blind marksman. 

Yet there are dozens of men and women across America who have been trained to shoot handguns and rifles without being able to see a foot ahead of them.

One such shooters is Carey McWilliams, who was holding his guide dog's harness when he boldly walked into the sheriff's office in Fargo, North Dakota, seeking a gun permit.

A skeptical clerk told him he'd need to pass a shooting test.

'So then she took a picture of me, and my application then went up through the ranks,' he told BBC.

'It got the signature of the chief of police of Fargo, the sheriff and the state attorney general's office, and they kept calling me and calling me, saying, "There's a shooting test, there's a shooting test."'

Then the day of the test came up.

Care McWilliams is completely blind, but that doesn't mean he is unable to hunt. In 2012, he made this 120-yard neck shot with a 270 bolt action rifle

One by one, McWilliams took out the half-size cutouts of assailants, firing the targets from about seven yards away with a .357 magnum.

All of his shots landed near the center.

'The deputy sheriff said: "Well, you have all these stickers here telling me that you're blind, but you passed the test, so you got your permit,"' McWilliams told BBC.

The sheriff added: 'Expect a lot of grief because you're a test case for the whole system, no-one's done this before.'

McWilliams shot the targets by listening to the sound of the cutout being wheeled back and forth.

He picked up the technique when he was 18 and begged a trainer to take him on a pistol marksmanship course run by the Reserve Officer's Training Corps.

The training group, which trains military officers, had no requirements that students be a part of the armed forces.

The instructor took him on reluctantly but later was aghast: McWilliams shot better than two-thirds of his class.

From there, he continued to perfect his art.

And once he was ready, in 2008, McWilliams moved on to hunting.

McWilliams listens to ducks fly across the sky, tracing the sound of wings with the barrel of his rifle, picking up on their sounds as if it were bicycle tires on a pavement.

For elk, a companion will whisper general directions to him, much like a sniper's spotter would in a combat situation.

'In the beginning I thought it was a joke, that somebody was blind and wanted to go on alligator hunt,' Mark Clemens, who a hunting business in Florida, told BBC.

'Then I sent an email back and I guessed he was serious,' he added. 'And once I got him on the phone, you know, he said that he was having a hard time finding anybody that would take him. That's what the sad part was. Everybody thought he wasn't capable of doing it. He was definitely capable of doing it, if he had instructions.'  

Miekka uses a sonic scope of his own design, which translates visual information into audio cues so he knows where the target is

McWilliams, who once shot a black bear, owns about nine guns, including an AR-15.

He says he has mentored nearly 100 blind people on how to shoot.

One of his students, Jim Miekka, uses a sonic scope of his own creation to shoot.

'I found out that it worked best with a telescope,' Miekka, who invented a device that translates visual information into audio cues, told BBC.

'At about the same time my best friend Bill was getting into target shooting, and he said, "Why don't we try mounting it on a gun and seeing how it works?"'

Miekka takes pride in his marksmanship. He is quick to point out that searching on Google for the term 'world's best target shooter' returns a video of him on his range.

But he doesn't go around boasting

'I learned from Carey that you want to be somewhat discreet,' Miekka told BBC.

For many of the people McWilliams teaches, carrying a gun is not just for sport.

'Being blind you're naturally more vulnerable to the criminal element,' McWilliams told BBC. 'You're naturally more a pedestrian. You can't avoid a dangerous situation or run from one if an attack occurs.

'So you're going to have to stand and fight with whatever means you have available. For me, that's a 9mm pistol.'

Permits to carry guns are issued at the state level, and each state has its own rules on who can get a weapon.

McWilliams had no problem getting a permit in North Dakota, where the statute has no language preventing a blind person from qualifying for one.

In Florida, however, he could be denied one because the law says 'physical inability to handle a firearm safely' could be a reason for denial.
