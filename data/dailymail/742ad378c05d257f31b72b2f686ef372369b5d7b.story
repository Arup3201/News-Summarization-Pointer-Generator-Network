Border officials have been accused of pointing a loaded gun at a Boy Scout's head while the child was on a camping trip.

According to Troop Leader Jim Fox, officials also threatened another boy with arrest, ten years in jail, and a $10,000 fine after he took a picture of them.

The incident happened as Mid-Iowa Boy Scout Troop 111 were attempting to cross the border between Canada and Alaska.

Scout leader Jim Fox (front) says border officials threatened to arrest one of his troop when he took a picture as they were crossing from Canada into Alaska, then pointed a loaded gun at another boy's head

Mr Fox said the incident began after one of the children took a picture of the border guards, at which point the officer threatened him with arrest, saying it was a felony offence

According to WCCI TV, four vans full of Scouts were travelling through the crossing as part of a 23-day trip when one boy attempted to take a picture of the guards.

Fox said: 'The agent immediately confiscated his camera, informed him he would be arrested, fined possibly $10,000 and 10 years in prison.'

The guard informed Fox that taking a picture of a border official was a felony offence, then ordered all the vehicles to be pulled over to one side to be searched.

Fox said he didn't complain as he did not want the situation to escalate further, but as another boy was taking camping gear down from the top of a truck, a second border guard pulled his gun.

Speaking about the boy, Fox added: 'He hears a snap of a holster, turns around, and here’s this agent, both hands on a loaded pistol, pointing at the young man’s head.'

The troop, which included 17 other Scouts and three volunteers, was held for another four hours before they were finally allowed to go on their way, with Fox saying the situation left them all afraid. 

But despite suffering through a terrifying ordeal, Scouting official Charles Vonderheid said the children should view the experience as a valuable lesson in 'civics'.

He added that it was every scout's mission to become a good citizen, and that it was important for boys to learn to follow the rules.

In total the group of 18 Scouts and four volunteers were held for four hours while border guards searched them

Fox, meanwhile, says the crossing incident has left him feeling deeply angry and upset.

He added: 'I am outraged by that fact that you have 18 boy scouts that want to come home [getting stopped], yet we have southern borders and border protection but it's like a sieve.'

According to regulations, pictures of federal facilities are allowed 'only with written permission of an authorized official of the occupying agency concerned.'

However, it is unclear whether that also applies to federal buildings and agents clearly visible in public places, which would be protected under constitutional law.

The law gives people the right to photograph anything visible in a public space in which a person is legally present as long as the building or people are in plain sight, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.

A spokesman for the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol said that the agency are aware of the story, but are not commenting at this time.
