United Airlines has reportedly issued an urgent warning to its pilots after a series of cockpit blunders that could have put passengers in danger.

The memo was said to have highlighted four 'major safety events,' including one where a pilot was forced to perform an emergency pull up maneuver to avoid crashing into the ground. 

The two page document entitled 'significant safety concerns,' was given to pilots last month, according to the Wall Street Journal.

United Airlines has reportedly issued a stern warning to its pilots after a series of cockpit blunders

Another incident reportedly highlighted in the report involved an aircraft flying with fuel levels that fell below the mandatory requirements. 

 The incidents, which all happened in the weeks leading up to the memo being produced, were categorized by the airline as 'major safety events and near-misses.'

'The common thread with all of these is that they are preventable,' the bulletin published by ABC News reads.

'We must ask ourselves, ''Do we have our priorities in line every time we put on our uniforms and strap into the airplane?'' 

It warned that a 'common thread' in the incidents was 'a lack of attention to discipline.' 

It was signed by Howard Attarian, Sr. Vice President Flight Operations, and Mike Quiello, Vice President Corporate Safety.

The airline said that it regularly alerts pilots to safety findings, including highlighting incidents in their memos, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The aim of the document was to 'get pilots' attention,' United Airlines spokesman Charlie Hobart, reportedly told CNN.  

One pilot, who declined to be named, said that the safety concerns might highlight 'training needs to be improved,' according to the news website.

'The responsibility is in their hands,' he added.

'As part of our commitment to safety, we constantly monitor flight operations data and regularly communicate the findings with our pilots,' United Airlines said in a statement.

'Our proactive approach to safety aligns with the FAA’s Safety Management System and enables us to recognize potential issues and adjust our actions to further ensure the safety of our customers and coworkers.'
