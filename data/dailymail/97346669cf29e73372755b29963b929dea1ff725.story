It's the type of scandal that would make most people in the public eye want to crawl under a rock, or at least keep a low profile for a short amount of time.

But then most stars aren't Simon Cowell, and instead of act ashamed of his actions, Simon has instead acted like it's business as usual - quite literally.

The music mogul brushed off the attention he's been receiving since it was revealed married socialite Lauren Silverman is pregnant with his best friend's baby by attending a One Direction concert on Saturday night.

Business as usual: Simon Cowell brushes off his pregnant lover scandal by attending a One Direction concert in Las Vegas on Saturday night

Simon, 53, was spotted mingling with fans as he stood in the audience and watched his X Factor stars perform in Las Vegas.

Cowell concentrated on the gig as he stood next to a male friend acting as if his problems were a million miles from him.

But while his woes aren't really a million miles from him he is certainly trying to distance himself while the news and fan reactions calm down.

Cowell jetted out of Los 
Angeles this weekend - leaving all the furore over
his married, pregnant lover behind.

The
X Factor supremo, 53, left California from a private airport and will 
join friends on board the Slipstream yacht in St Tropez, in the South of
France, for what is expected to be a month-long vacation.

Taking his mind off things: Simon even attended a press conference this week despite the furore surrounding his private life since Lauren Silverman, his best friend's wife, revealed she's pregnant with his baby

He
will tour Europe and take time to evaluate how exactly to proceed after
it was revealed last week that New York socialite Lauren Silverman - 
married to his friend Andrew - is expecting his baby.

Members of Cowell's harem including 
his ex-girlfriend and 80s popstar Sinitta, and even possibly his former 
fiancee Mezghan Hussainy, are expected to join him.

Both are standing by him and have given him their full support.

Ironically,
it was on board the $458,000-a-week Slipstream that Cowell was pictured
sharing a tender embrace with Lauren last August, in images that came 
to light earlier this week.

But
as Cowell soaks up the sun, his lover is spending the weekend in the 
Hamptons with her estranged husband as they attempt to come to an 
'amicable resolution' over their divorce, according to one source.

The couple want to make their seven-year-old son Adam their main priority, the source said.

New revelations: Simon Cowell is said to have ended his relationship with Lauren before he knew she was pregnant

And it seems Simon will need to use his time on holiday to come to terms with the expense of his latest scandal.

Cowell is reportedly set to pay out £63 million in child support.

The
53-year-old music mogul is said to have pledged to give her £3 million a
year until the youngster turns 21 after taking legal and financial 
advice over the "messy" situation.

A
source told the Daily Star Sunday newspaper: 'He wants to ensure he 
does the right thing for her and their baby as well as resolving this 
mess.

'Simon wanted to know exactly where he stands and to minimise the damage this will do to his bank balance.

'Over': Reports are claiming Simon finished with Lauren, only to then be told she was pregnant with his child

'He has a good relationship with 
Lauren at the moment but when you're as wealthy as Simon, you can't take
any chances. Money changes people.'

Simon
has been named in divorce papers filed by Andrew and it is claimed the X
Factor boss has "happily agreed" to cover his former friend's legal 
costs if he drops an adultery claim in favour of a no contest divorce.

Andrew
has been spotted at the lavish New York home he shared with Lauren - 
who stands to receive between $3 and $4 million in the divorce under the
terms of their pre-nuptial agreement - and their son over the last few 
days, but friends insist there has been minimal communication between 
the estranged couple.

One pal told the New York Post newspaper: 'Andrew stayed at the house to create some normalcy for their son.

'There
was no talk about the divorce settlement. That is being handled by the 
lawyers. There was minimal conversation between them. It was done purely
for their child.'

And while he was enjoying himself at the One Direction concert, more news broke about his situation as it has been claimed he actually dumped Lauren six weeks ago - before he knew she was pregnant.

The 53-year-old music mogul is said to have ended his romance with the 36-year-old socialite - the wife of his close friend Andrew Silverman - six weeks ago, only to later discover she is expecting his baby.

He is said to have told a friend: 'It's over with Lauren - it has been since before anyone knew she was pregnant. I want matters resolved but in a sensitive way. I have to respect a lot of people's feelings. There's a lot of people's feelings here.'

Break: Cowell was spotted leaving Los Angeles on his private jet on Friday night

Simon is said to be feeling "confused" about Lauren's pregnancy but has vowed to stand by her.

The source added to the Sunday Mirror newspaper: 'Simon feels like he's been done up like a kipper in all of this.

'He and Lauren split up six weeks ago but the next thing we know he gets a phone call from her saying, 'Guess what?' Since then he has been feeling very confused about everything.'

Lauren's mother, Carole Saland, meanwhile has slammed claims her daughter deliberately got pregnant to "trap" the 'X Factor' boss.

Happy days: Cowell and Silverman vacationing in France last August. He left for St Tropez this weekend

And she's calling for him to do the "right thing" and marry her pregnant daughter.

She told The Sun newspaper: 'Lauren is not a gold-digger. She came from a very comfortable family and never lacked for anything.

'Her and Simon are very fond of each other. She tells me great things about him and has always spoken very highly of him...

"I trust Simon to do the right thing by my daughter.'

Lauren - who is 10 weeks pregnant - has a seven-year-old son, Adam, with Andrew.

The casino boss has filed for divorce.
