Batsman remains in induced coma

Stuart Broad defends Sean Abbott 

Sean Abbott is reportedly struggling after bowling the bouncer that has left Phillip Hughes fighting for his life in a Sydney hospital.

Abbott was seen walking into Sydney Cricket Ground, where Hughes was struck on the back of the head by his short-pitched ball during a Sheffield Shield match on Tuesday.

Counsellors and team-mates continue to help the 22-year-old following the accident amid concerns for the New South Wales paceman.

Cricket Australia's executive general manager of team performance, Pat Howard, confirmed all New South Wales and South Australia players were receiving counselling after the incident.

The Australian Cricketers' Association added they were particularly focusing on Abbott.

Their CEO Alistair Nicholson said: '[Abbott] has got a lot of support around him from his team-mates and also the counselling services.'

'He's someone who we're monitoring closely and we know he's got a lot of support around him.'

Hughes remains in a critical condition following scans on Wednesday morning after he had a 90-minute operation to relieve pressure on his brain the day before.

Abbott attended to Hughes after the 25-year-old hit the ground face first, and Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland has said they will offer any help they can. 

'It says a lot about Sean, doesn't it?' Sutherland said. 'Sean will have all the support he needs around him. 

'I'm sure his team-mates and everyone doesn't feel in any way ill of him for what happened. It's a freak, freak incident.' 

The sporting community, including Marcus North, have come out in support of bowler Abbott

Cricket legend Glenn McGrath wrote 'our thoughts are also with Sean Abbott' after he paid tribute to Hughes

Former Australian bowler Stuart Clark told Fox Sports he understood Abbott was 'struggling a bit' and insisted the incident was not his fault.

'He's out there to get Phil Hughes out. It's a competitive sport. It's professional sport and I really feel for Sean Abbott at the moment,' he said.

'I hope he's got support. You just worry that this could jeopardise Sean Abbott and his cricket career and we don't want that.' 

Abbott and Hughes came up through the junior ranks of the New South Wales cricketing system together.
