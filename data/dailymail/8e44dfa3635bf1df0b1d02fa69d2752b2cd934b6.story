We are all guilty of a little overindulgence when treating ourselves to an extravagant dinner out but a new restaurant concept is set to leave diners feeling guilt-free by helping them burn off the calories consumed before they even walk out of the door.

Miele will launch Britain's first 
calorie-neutral restaurant: Steam, which is bound to have foodie lovers nationwide rejoicing.

The pop-up eatery in London's Covent Garden, promises to help diners enjoy healthy, steamed food 
without compromising on taste, or their waist.

Calorie neutral: The new pop-up offers diners freshly cooked food followed by sessions to help them burn off the calories before the leave

And before food aficionados start panicking, 'calorie-neutral' doesn't mean you will just be nibbling on lettuce leaves and sipping water.

Miele has teamed up with the award-winning Head Chef at The Boundary, Frederick Forster, and maintains that every meal served oozes with flavour.

So, what will be served up? Dishes 
for the day include scallop and chorizo brouchette with cucumber and 
ginger dressing, beef fillet with beansprout salad, quail egg cocotte 
with mushroom and leek fondue and prawn stuffed lemon sole with herb 
butter sauce.

Diners will even enjoy a dessert, as Frederick is serving up a tasty banana cake with confit pineapple and crème chantilly.

After a healthy feast, diners will be invited to participate in a number of interactive activities to burn the calories before bed.

Dominic Worsley, Marketing Director at Miele said: 'We are very excited about the launch of Steam.

'This is something that has never been done before, so we can't wait to hear what people think. If the restaurant proves a success, we'd love to roll them out across the country.'

Talking about the restaurant, National Chef of the Year Frederick Forster added: 'To show that healthy food can be tasty too, all of the dishes I have created for the restaurant will be cooked using Miele steam ovens.

What's cooking: From Quail egg cocotte with mushroom and leek fondue to banana bread for dessert, the menu promises to be tasty

'Cooking with steam preserves all natural flavours, vitamins, colour and texture, and there is no need to add oils or fats to your food, making it healthier than food cooked using other methods.'

As a supporter of The Haven, Miele will also be raising money for the UK breast cancer charity at the restaurant launch.
