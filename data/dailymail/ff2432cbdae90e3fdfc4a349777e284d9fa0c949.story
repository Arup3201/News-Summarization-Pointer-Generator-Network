A New York Times journalist who has worked as a correspondent in China since 2000 has been forced to leave the country following the paper's report about the Prime Minister's family wealth.

Chris Buckley, a 45-year-old Australian reporter known for his balanced reporting and rigor, flew out of Beijing with his partner and 12-year-old daughter on Monday after authorities failed to renew his annual media accreditation and residence visa before the December 31 deadline.

He had sought to update his paperwork after leaving Reuters, a news agency and rejoining the Times in September. Despite numerous requests, authorities did not act in time and he has now flown to Hong Kong, The Times reported.

Report: In October, the New York Times revealed Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao's family's wealth. A Times correspondent in China, Chris Buckley, has now failed to have his visa renewed

Requests to transfer visas in the country are usually processed within weeks and Buckley has reportedly received no official explanation about why he has not received his.

The delay could be seen as retaliation for  an October 25 news report about the family wealth of the Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao, theÂ Sydney Morning Herald reported.

The report revealed Mr Wen's relatives had acquired at least $2.7 billion in assets.

Within hours of it being published, the powers-that-be in the Communist state blocked the paper's website both in English and Chinese.

Searches for the publication's site 
as well as the names of Mr Wen's family members were also barred on the 
country's main microblog service with the Chinese government describing 
the feature as a 'smear'.

But it was just one in a series of foreign reports about how leading Communist Party families have acquired enormous wealth despite their professed socialist ideals.

Bloomberg has also been blocked in China since a June 29 investigative report that close relatives of new leader, Xi Jinping, had accrued 
assets of more than $1 billion.

The refusal to allow Buckley to stay in the country comes despite Mr Xi's 20-year-old daughter, Xi Mingze, currently attending Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The failed visas also suggests a concerning double standard, where reporters from Chinese state media are given access to Australia and the U.S. - yet it does not appear to be fully reciprocated.

The new 
Beijing bureau chief, U.S. citizen Philip P. Pan, has also failed to receive accreditation, despite applying in March.

'I regret that Chris Buckley has been forced to relocate outside of 
China despite our repeated requests to renew his journalist visa,' Jill 
Abramson, the executive editor of The Times, said.

'I 
hope the Chinese authorities will issue him a new visa as soon as 
possible and allow Chris and his family to return to Beijing. I also 
hope that Phil Pan, whose application for journalist credentials has 
been pending for months, will also be issued a visa to serve as our 
bureau chief in Beijing.'

The Times noted that six other reporters in China have had their visas renewed for 2013 in a timely manner. David Barboza, who wrote the articles about Mr. Wen, was among these, they said.

The New York Times article stated that the family of Mr Wen, 70, 
known for his humble background - his mother was a teacher and his 
father tended pigs - have accumulated most of their assets since Wen was
named vice premier in 1998 before his promotion to Prime Minister nine 
years ago.

The estimate of his family's wealth was made according to a review of corporate and regulatory records from 1992 to 2012.

According
to the review, his widowed mother Yang Zhiyun, 90, has had just one 
investment to her name - in a financial services company with assets 
worth $120 million in 2007.

Aside
from his mother, Mr Wen's son, daughter, younger brother and 
brother-in-law appear to have made most of the money with their 'knack 
for aggressive deal making,' as the Times describes it.

The family has assets in 
telecommunications companies, jewellers, tourist resorts, and banks 
among other projects and the records show that family business ventures 
received support from state owned corporations such as the nation's 
largest mobile phone operator China Mobile.

No holdings were found in Mr Wen's own name.

The family also profited from 
opportunities arising from state decisions according to the report - 
though it is not known what role Mr Wen plays in those decisions.

His wife Zhang Beili is a leading authority on jewellery and a state diamond company that she ran were privatised. Mr Wen stepped down as part of a transition of power on November 8.
