The BBC is sending 300 staff to cover Glastonbury festival – 28 more than it is sending to the World Cup in Brazil just weeks before.

The astonishing number of employees will descend on the four-day music event to provide wall-to-wall television and radio coverage, at a time when the Corporation is under pressure to make budget cuts.

Yesterday campaigners claimed the staffing plans were ‘overkill’ and amounted to little more than a ‘jolly’ for staff.

The BBC will send more staff for its coverage of Glastonbury Festival. This year's presenting team including Chris Evans, Lauren Laverne and Jo Whiley

In total there will be 250 hours of 
Glastonbury coverage, the same as last year when the BBC faced criticism
 that it was giving the festival too much airtime.

Headliners
 for this year’s event are Arcade Fire, Kasabian and Metallica, with 
acts such as Robert Plant and Dolly Parton also among those who will 
play.

It
 will be spread across all BBC channels, as well as Radio One, Radio 
Two, iPlayer, the red button and the BBC website, including an edition 
of The One Show from the festival site in Somerset. Coverage will be 
hosted by a team of 17 presenters including including Jo Whiley, Fearne Cotton, 
Dermot O’Leary, Lauren Laverne, Steve Lamacq, Greg James, Stuart 
Maconie, Pete Tong, Cerys Matthews and Mark Radcliffe, with Chris Evans 
and Alex Jones hosting the Glastonbury edition of The One Show.

The BBC 
said the number of employees going to the festival is reflective of the 
‘demanding workload’ and that all 300 have a ‘clear and accountable’ 
role.

The BBC is broadcasting 30 hours of TV coverage across its channels and more than 50 hours of radio

By comparison, this year’s World Cup coverage has seen a reduction in numbers on the 295 who staffed the South African contest.

John O’Connell, 
director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, branded it an ‘inappropriate’ use 
of resources, saying: ‘Taxpayers will be deeply suspicious that their 
money is being used to send staff on a jolly.

‘The
 BBC is already sending 272 people to Brazil for the World Cup, and 
sending another 300 to Glastonbury does seem like overkill. People will 
be watching the coverage closely – it had better be worth the expense.’

Last year the BBC faced similar criticism after spending £2million sending a 296-strong team to the festival.

There
 were further complaints over the quality of broadcasts, with music fans
 branding presenters ‘annoying’ and accusing them of filling time with 
‘boring chit chat’.

BBC 
music chief Bob Shennan yesterday defended this year’s staffing 
decision, saying: ‘We’re sending the same number of people as last year 
and, whilst some will inevitably still argue this is too many, I can 
assure you that every member of staff on-site has a clear and 
accountable role, working long hours to offer unparalleled coverage for 
our audience.

‘We have worked hard in recent years to identify areas where resources can be shared or tasks more easily undertaken off-site.’

Metallica have proved a controversial headliner with some festival-goers unhappy they are topping the bill

'Whilst we are working hard to ensure we are being as efficient as possible, we will not compromise the quality of our output and we have been robust in scrutinising our plans and minimising costs.'

Metallica have proved a controversial booking for the event with some festival-goers unhappy that a hard rock act are topping the bill.

Some have said the group’s inclusion is against the event’s environmental ethos, as frontman James Hetfield supports bear hunting.

Mr Shennan said he hoped the BBC coverage of the band’s performance would do justice to their renowned 'powerful, pyrotechnical performances'.

But he added: 'If metal isn’t your cup of tea however, there will be plenty of alternatives just a few clicks away on your tablets or interactive TVs.'

A BBC 
spokesman said: 'Broadcasting comprehensive, high-quality coverage of 
major cultural events requires this level of resource and every member 
of staff onsite has a clear and accountable role, working long hours to 
offer more than 250 hours of unrivalled coverage across to audiences 
across TV, radio and online.
