The High Court in Dublin has dismissed an application to extradite a senior Irish Republican Army veteran wanted in the U.S. over alleged links to a North Korean counterfeiting plot.

Seán Garland, from Navan, County Meath, has been fighting extradition from the Republic of Ireland since his arrest in Dublin in 2009.

Authorities in the U.S. want the 77-year-old former IRA adjutant-general to face charges over distribution of high-quality counterfeit U.S. dollars produced in North Korea.

Garland had previously absconded on bail from Northern Ireland, which remains under British jurisdiction, when facing extradition on the same charges in 2005.

High Court Justice John Edwards said today that he will explain his reasons for refusing the U.S. extradition request on January 13.

A Marxist, Garland was one of a generation of IRA leaders who attempted to introduce a left-wing political agenda into the organisation.

He became a key figure in the Official Irish Republican Army after its split from the Provos at the beginning of the Seventies, and rose to the position of president in Sinn Féin, the militant group's political wing, which was subsequently renamed the Workers Party under his direction.

The U.S. Justice Department indictment accused Garland of circulating North Korean counterfeit $100 bills in the Nineties.

According to some estimates, one in 10,000 U.S dollar bills is a 'superdollar' counterfeit.

So called because of the calibre of the forgeries, the name derives from the fact that their quality exceeds that of real dollar bills.

The notes are said to be made with the high quality ink printed on a cotton/linen blend using the intaglio and typographic printing processes.

The U.S. Government believes that these notes are most likely being produced in North Korea.

Based on the testimony of defectors they allege that the bills are produced in a factory based in the city of Pyongsong and distributed around the world through North Korean embassies.

The U.S. Secret Service estimates that North Korea has produced $45million in superdollars since 1989.

Other speculated sources include Iran and Syria, criminal gangs operating out of China and Russia - or even the CIA itself.

It alleged he worked in cooperation 
with the Russian Communist Party and British criminal contacts to 
organise the distribution and resale of the 'super-dollars' - so called 
because of their high quality of the forgeries.

In an affidavit to the High Court, the
 U.S. stated: 'This case involved a long-standing and large-scale 
supernotes distribution network based in the Republic of Ireland and 
headed by Seán Garland, a senior officer in the Irish Workers' Party.'

The U.S. alleges that Mr Garland and 
six co-conspirators, a Russian, a South African and four Englishmen, 
used couriers to transport supernotes around the world.

On a number of occasions between 1997 
and 2000, Garland was allegedly seen visiting the North Korean embassy 
in Moscow along with some ex-KGB officers.

According to the U.S. indictment, he 
visited to collect forged US dollars which, with the help of associates,
 would be transported to Dublin and Birmingham where the notes would be 
exchanged for pounds or authentic dollars.

The indictment also refers to Garland 
as 'the man in the hat' and identified specific dates when he had 
transported forged currency from North Korean embassies.

Garland denies the accusation.
