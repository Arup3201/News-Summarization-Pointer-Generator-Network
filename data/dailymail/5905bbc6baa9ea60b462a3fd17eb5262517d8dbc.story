Among British aristocrats there has been but one topic of conversation since King Juan Carlos of Spain announced his abdication: will HM the Queen follow his example?

Now one of this country’s most prominent bluebloods, historian John Julius Norwich, has spoken out to urge Her Majesty not to renounce the throne in favour of Prince Charles — even if she becomes seriously ill.

‘The Queen should not stand down,’ Viscount Norwich tells me. ‘It doesn’t matter if she gets Alzheimer’s. I mean, George III went a bit crazy and had a Regent. The same could happen again.’

Lord Norwich, who will speak on Wednesday at the Chalke Valley History Festival near Salisbury, compares King Juan Carlos’s abdication to Pope Benedict XVI’s resignation last year. He was the first pontiff to quit in almost 600 years.

‘I was shocked when Pope Benedict stood down, like a bank manager,’ says the 84-year-old historian, who through his father, Tory politician and diplomat Duff Cooper, is descended from William IV and his mistress Dorothea Jordan.

‘A pope shouldn’t do that. He should have stayed on until death. He has set a pretty awful precedent.’

It is highly unusual for a public figure to discuss the Queen’s health in such frank terms. Her Majesty is in fine fettle at 88, while the Queen Mother lived to 101.

Juan Carlos, 76, is reported to have told courtiers that he stepped down because he wanted to hand over the throne while his son and heir, Crown Prince Felipe, 46, was still a young man to stop him ‘withering’ like Charles. The Prince of Wales, 65, is the oldest heir to the British throne for 300 years.

Author Kate Williams, who will speak at Chalke Valley on Saturday, says: ‘Although the Queen will never abdicate, she will step back increasingly from the role — especially the more arduous duties, public occasions etc. She has already stepped back from foreign travel.’

Why consult octopuses and apps to predict the winner of the World Cup when you have the impeccable logic of Kwasi Kwarteng, MP for Spelthorne.  Kwarteng, whose new book, War And Gold: A Five Hundred-Year History Of Empires, Adventures And Debt, was published last month, has a sensible theory. ‘South American countries always win when the tournament’s held in South or Latin America,’ he tells me. So who does he think will win? ‘Argentina,’ says Kwarteng, who will be speaking at today’s  Chalke Valley History Festival for Schools.

Television presenter Peter Snow admits to feeling nervous about the publication in the U.S. this summer of his book, When Britain Burned The White House: The 1814 Invasion Of Washington.

‘I’m very worried,’ he tells me. ‘I’m going over, as the book will be published there on the anniversary of the invasion, August 1814, but I’m concerned about the number of eggs and tomatoes that may be thrown at me.’

‘I think it was one of the most shameful defeats in U.S. history,’ says Snow. ‘It took a long time to recover from the humiliation.’

Snow, who will be discussing his book at the Chalke Valley History Festival this Sunday, is optimistic about the future of that thoroughly British institution, BBC’s flagship current affairs programme Newsnight, which he presented 17 years ago.

‘It’s really terrific,’ he says. ‘Newsnight still remains untouchable. Jeremy [Paxman] will be very hard to replace. But there are plenty of good candidates.’

Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt MP is looking forward to his Chalke Valley History Festival talk this Saturday.  The reason? The venue is piquantly close to the South Dorset seat of Tory MP Richard Drax, whose slave-trading family is extensively covered in Hunt’s latest book, Cities Of Empire.  Last year it emerged that Drax’s ancestors, who made a fortune running slave plantations in Barbados, were given compensation for  having to release 189 slaves in 1833.

Antiques Roadshow presenter Fiona Bruce was criticised a few months ago by art expert Lucinda Lambton who said she was  ‘unqualified and not highbrow enough’ for the show and an example of the BBC dumbing down.

Since then, however, Bruce has discovered a lost Van Dyck sketch, soon to be auctioned at Christie’s, and has won praise from her TV art sleuth close colleague and Fake Or Fortune? co-presenter Philip Mould.

‘Her instincts were bang-on,’ says the gallant Mould, who once discovered a lost painting of Henry VIII’s older brother Prince Arthur and will be speaking at the Chalke Valley History Festival tomorrow. ‘She has become a very valuable part of the show. By taking part in programmes like this, you can’t help learning about artistic technique.’

Over to Lucinda, wife of Sir Peregrine Worsthorne. ‘I’m delighted Philip Mould is singing Fiona’s praises,’ she says. ‘Well done her. That’s terrific. Did she really do it herself?’
