You can lead a lion cub to water, and even make it drink ... just don't try to make it jump across, as this patient lioness learned the hard way.

The mother lion tried to make her five youngsters cross a river where a freshly-killed topi was waiting to be eaten in Kenya's Masai Mara last month.

Wildlife photographer and Exodus guide Paul Goldstein arrived just as the scaredy cats were preparing to cross.

Scaredy cats: The cats were being encouraged by the lioness to cross the water to where a freshly-killed topi was waiting to be eaten

Masterclass: The pictures show five cubs being led down to the water, before being given a masterclass in leaping the obstacle by their mother

We will not be moved! But still they would not budge, unwilling to risk setting foot in the cold water

Force: The mother even tried force in a bid to persuade her cubs to cross the river

Cajoled: And still they looked at her blankly from the opposite bank as she cajoled them with every motherly trick she had

Take a break: The lioness then took her young to another part of the stream to try again where they drank some water in preparation

Follow in her pawprints: Time and time again the mother leapt over the stream with Olympic grace only to fail in her persuasion

She, with the help of another lioness, began by giving them a masterclass in leaping the obstacle, padding down on the other side without getting a hair wet.

But the cubs were less than impressed and resolutely remained on the bank, refusing to budge. 

Paul explains: 'This particular morning in October we had an early start from Kicheche Bush Camp in the Mara Olare Conservancy to search for the fabled marsh lions. 

'It took a while to find them but finally we spotted a couple of females feasting on a very fresh topi kill. The only problem was the five cubs were on the wrong side of a stream. 

'The adults were clearly uncomfortable about this and made several attempts to entice them over but it was chilly that morning and clearly the water did not look lovely to the cubs. 

Finally: Finally after yet another airborne example from their mother, the two youngest cubs leapt over

Easy peasy: At first it looked like they were going to clear the stream with ease

Splash: But they fell short by a matter of inches, splashing down in the cold water

Made it! They were wet but alive and made it to the other side where their dinner was waiting

Tasty: Moments later they were tucking in to the topi on the other side

Tasty: Once they had had their fill, she gave them a bath to clean off the mud from the stream

Cheeky: And after they were fed, the cheeky youngsters found time to mess about before their mother brought an abrupt end to the fun

'The whole adventure took almost 30 minutes, there was no-one else there except my three Kicheche land cruisers and the show was incredible. 

'Time and time again the mothers leapt over the stream with Olympic grace only to fail in their persuasion. 

'They coaxed, they cajoled, they flattered and they even tried picking up their charges but to no avail. It was very endearing to hear the cub's cries of anguish and trepidation. 

'Finally after yet another airborne example the two youngest leapt over, getting pretty damp in the process. The mothers then went back for the other three older cubs. 

'Finally, they all cleared the river and with stomachs calling tucked into breakfast. I abhor humanising animals and dislike cheesy interpretations of animal behaviour, particularly on TV, but that morning you really had to feel for mum. 

'It was a very special half hour which I am unlikely to forget in a while. Fortunately one of my clients David Moxon was filming, we both had big smiles at the end of the water jumps.'

She appears to try everything from cajoling to picking them up, but they still will not dare risk getting wet
