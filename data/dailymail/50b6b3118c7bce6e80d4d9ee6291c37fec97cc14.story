Europe's answer to a 'space taxi' is now poised and ready to launch on a February 11 test flight.

Dubbed the IXV, for Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle, the craft will provide Europe with its own shuttle-like, reusable space vehicle.

This mission will provide vital flight data that could help Europe develop technology for a sample return mission to Mars, or to return astronauts from the space station.

On February 11, the Vega rocket will be launching the unmanned space plane from Kourou, French Guiana, to undertake a 100-minute test flight. 

The initial launch had been scheduled for November 18, but Arianespace in October announced a postponement 'to carry out additional flight trajectory analyses'.

Studded with 300 sensors, the prototype IXV will collect data on the craft's handling and thermodynamics.

'Launch preparations have resumed,' said Jose-Maria Gallego Sanz, Esa's IXV launch campaign manager.

'Batteries that were removed from IXV are being taken from cold storage, charged and reinstalled. No additional tests are needed – IXV is ready to fly.'  said Jose-Maria Gallego Sanz, Esa's IXV launch campaign manager. Pictured is an artist's impression

Weighing around two tonnes and the size of a car, IXV is a snug fit inside Vega's protective fairing.

The two-piece shell will open to release the space plane at an altitude of 200 miles (320 km).

IXV will coast to up to 260 miles (420 km) and then begin its re-entry phase, recording a vast amount of data from a large number of conventional and advanced sensors.

The entry speed of 4.6 miles per second (7.5 km/s) at an altitude of 75 miles (120 km) will create the same conditions as those for a vehicle returning from low orbit. 

This mission will provide vital flight data that could help Europe develop technology for a sample return mission to Mars, or to return astronauts from the space station. Pictured is the IXV installed on its payload adapter

Developed over five years at a cost of 150 million euros ($225 million), the IXV is the testbed for a reusable vehicle that may one day be able to land on a conventional runway on Earth after a mission to space

IXV will be launched into a suborbital path by a Vega rocket launched from spaceport in French Guiana in February 11. IXV will separate from Vega at an altitude of 200 miles (340 km)

IXV will glide through the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds to test new re-entry technologies before parachutes deploy to slow the descent for a splashdown in the Pacific.

The Nos Aries recovery vessel is now stationed in Flamenco Island Anchorage in Panama. Over the last month, the crew have been testing the equipment for hoisting IXV out of the water.

Developed over five years at a cost of 150 million euros ($225 million), the IXV is the testbed for a reusable vehicle that may one day be able to land on a conventional runway on Earth after a mission to space.

This could be useful for bringing astronauts back from the International Space Station (ISS).

The only craft currently able to ferry astronauts to the ISS and back is Russia's Soyuz. 

IXV program manager, Giorgio Tumino, said there are a number of follow-on applications for re-entry technologies, including Mars sample-return missions

Last month saw two major setbacks for the space industry.

On October 28, an Orbital Sciences Antares rocket exploded shortly after launch on what was to be a supply mission to the ISS.

This was followed three days later by the crash of Virgin Galactic tourist space plane SpaceShipTwo on a test flight, killing one of two pilots.
