Two rogue Afghan policemen brazenly posed for pictures with British soldiers minutes before shooting them dead, an inquest heard today.

Corporal Brent McCarthy, 25, and Lance Corporal Lee Davies, 27, were killed at an Afghan police base in Lashkar Gah, Helmand province, on May 12 last year.

The soldiers killed in the attack had been part of an eight-man British Army patrol, with an interpreter, advising and training local forces.

The patrol had gone to the base so British officers could meet local police officials, with Cpl McCarthy - an RAF policeman - acting as a specialist adviser.

However, a short while after the patrol arrived, there was a burst of gunfire which left both servicemen, including L/Cpl Davies, of 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, fatally injured.

The two suspected killers, dressed in police uniforms, were seen dashing out the base’s main gate and across fields by another British soldier who managed to get a shot off at one of them.

The inquest at Oxfordshire Coroners Court was shown several photographs including one of Cpl McCarthy, of the Royal Air Force, with one of the policemen - each holding the other's weapon.

Another showed both Afghans posing for the camera with their own AK47 rifles.

Guardsman Joshua Foley, of the Welsh Guards, told the inquest that the training group had 'a good relationship' with the Afghans.

But a some point a new local police unit had moved into the base and when the British patrol had arrived that afternoon there were several unfamiliar faces among the Afghan units, he said.

He said he and his comrades had been trained to pick up on warning signs - 'atmospherics' - that might suggest a possible betrayal by Afghan security forces.

Such attacks are known in the Army as a green on blue incident.

However, asked by the coroner for Oxfordshire, Darren Salter, if he was aware of any heightened risk before the patrol set out that day he said he was not, adding 'the atmospherics were fine'.

As he was stood with L/Cpl Davies and Cpl McCarthy, two Afghan policemen passed them near the main entrance to the base and there was an attempt by the British soldiers to strike up some 'banter'.

'We tried to have a laugh with them but they didn’t seem to get it,' Guardsman Foley told the coroner.

However, Cpl McCarthy then produced a camera and the Afghans agreed to have some photos taken, including with Cpl McCarthy and Guardsman Foley.

Guardsman Foley then described how L/Cpl Davies said to his fellow soldiers that one of the Afghans appeared to have a wet patch between his legs.

'He said "look, he’s pissed himself, he’s scared of you",' said Guardsman Foley.

Asked by the coroner if he thought either of the Afghans heard the comment, Guardsman Foley said he did not believe they had and pointed out they seemed to understand very little, if any, English.

He then left L/Cpl Davies and Cpl McCarthy with the policemen to take up duty in one of the base’s two guard towers.

'I heard a rapid burst of shots, and as I looked I saw the two Afghan police holding their weapons and L/Cpl Davies was lying back,' said Guardsman Foley.

'I did not see the Afghan police fire any shots but they both ran out of the main entrance.'

Mr Salter asked: 'You saw the two before and then immediately after the shots, were you able to see if it was the same two?'

Guardsman Foley replied: 'Yes, it was them.'

The two soldiers, who were injured, were quickly evacuated. Both men were pronounced dead later.
