Walking free: A stalker, pictured but cannot be named, subjected his TV star victim to a campaign of 'serious alarm and distress' but was still able to walk free today

A 'sad' loner who stalked a TV personality and made sinister references to the murder of Jill Dando before trying to kiss her outside her office was spared jail today.

The middle-aged fantasist bombarded the presenter with 517 tweets and scores of emails, texts and phone calls declaring his love for the woman.

Both parties cannot be named for legal reasons. 

The stalker dreamed of sweeping the victim off her feet on 'a white charger' before getting her 'happily pregnant' and believed they were having a 'cyber-affair'.

Judge John Hillen QC said he lived 'a sad, lonely and isolated existence', and told him at the end his trial at Blackfriars Crown Court it was just 'a continuation of your stalking and obsession'.

But the man was still allowed to walk free after Mr Justice Hillen gave him a suspended sentence. 

His trial heard how had terrified the star with messages with bizarre references to crimes including the Jill Dando murder, which the victim made her 'blood run cold' and left her fearing for her life.

The Crimewatch presenter was shot outside her home in Fulham, west London, in April 1999, aged 37, and her killer has never been found.

The stalker, who now has a permanent restraining order, claimed in court: 'I wanted to start a conversation about the Jill Dando killing, and why nobody ever talks about it'.

But the TV personality spoke of her horror at the message, saying: 'For any woman on television - the name Jill Dando - it strikes terror into your heart, that if you are on screen and you are on TV, you are going to get targeted. Reading that, my blood runs cold'.

She also described to the court an unwanted kiss on the cheek at a charity event at the O2 Arena, which prosecutors claimed amounted to sexual assault.

'I felt humiliated wiping that [saliva] off my cheek', the victim said.

But the obsessive argued it was a 'flamboyant air-kiss' to say thanks for an autograph, and that his behaviour was not sexually motivated.

The stalker - who described himself as 'cheeky' - even tried to bring hand-warmers to her office as a gift and sent her an inscribed edition of romantic novel The Scarlet Letter for Christmas.

As a result, bosses insisted she stop taking public transport and police advised her to step up her home security.

The stalker, who was one of the first prosecuted under the tougher Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, was convicted after a trial at Blackfriars Crown Court.

Fear: The stalker mentioned the unsolved murder of Jill Dando in 1992, which he claimed was just for a general conversation, but his victim said she then feared for her like

But he walked free from court after Judge John Hillen QC said he lived 'a sad existence' and was 'lonely and isolated'.

He said: 'You contested this trial before the jury. It seems to me - in my judgment - that it was apparent that the trial was a continuation of your stalking and obsession.

'You gained pleasure from having [your victim] in the witness box all to satisfy your vanity and self-gratification.

'She was left feeling that she constantly had to be careful for herself and her family. Your unwanted attentions therefore had an adverse effect on her usual day-to-day activities.

'In short, you took away her peace of mind. Your repeated behaviour, your pestering of her was unacceptable, oppressive and demonstrated obsessive attention towards her.'

The judge added he was satisfied he 'had followed her or watched her at the restaurant to which she took contacts'.

He sentenced the stalker to six months imprisonment suspended for 18 months and an indefinite restraining order. Neither the stalker nor the victim can be named.

Defence counsel Karen Walton said her client was 'theatrical and fantastical' and said he 'apologises profusely' and'has had to hang his head in shame'.

Referring to her client's health problems, Miss Walton commented, 'He is a fairly classic example of somebody who can't physically go out and see the world but becomes infatuated with what he has seen through his computer.'

Trial: The fantasist had denied stalking and a sex assault saying that he and the woman were friends and he believed they had a 'cyber-affair' 

The stalker had claimed to be in a 'cyber-affair' with the presenter, after she politely replied to a handful of emails and Tweets about current affairs.

'She and I had had a pen-pal relationship on email', he said at his trial, adding: 'I sent her an email and she wrote back to me. She was so friendly. She wrote back to me straight away.'  

The stalker, from north London, was convicted of stalking involving serious alarm or distress. 

Jurors failed to return a verdict on the alleged sexual assault, and prosecutors asked for the count to lie on the file.

He was ordered to contribute £250 to prosecution costs of £2,000.
