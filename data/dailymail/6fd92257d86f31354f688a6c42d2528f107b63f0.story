Students at the University of Nottingham are being investigated over a twisted 'rugby-style' chant about necrophilia. 

The students from the Cavendish Hall at the university sang a bawdy chant outside their accommodation as part of their Freshers' Week celebrations. 

However, several of the lines of the chant were very objectionable. Including one about disinterring a sexual partner for a reunion.

According to the Impact Nottingham student magazine, the chant was led by former residents of the accommodation block.

The University hired students to act as 'Week One Reps', acting as guides to new students. 

One student told the magazine: 'I went out every other night for the rest of the week. Each night I heard the same chant, still being led by Week One Reps.

'As the week progressed, freshers started to lead the chants themselves. On the Sunday night, whilst on the bus and queueing for the Freshers’ Finale [hosted at Capital FM Arena], I heard the chant seven times in the space of an hour.'

One student recorded the controversial chant on their mobile phone before uploading it to the internet. 

I wanna be a Cavendish ranger, living a life of sex and danger.

High flying, 69-ing.

These are the girls that I love best, many times I’ve s***** their breasts.

F*** her standing, f*** her lying, if she had wings I’d f*** her flying.

Now she’s dead, but not forgotten, dig her up and...

Anagharad Smith, who was a co-ordinator for the Week One events said that Reps had signed a contract outlawing  'abusive, offensive, crude or intimidating chants or songs'. 

According to The Guardian, the Students' Union is conducting an investigation into the vile chanting which has been considered misogynistic.  

The University's Students' Union has received complaints from campus feminist organisations over the 'laddish' nature of the singing. 

As part of the chant, the leader sings a line which is immediately repeated by the group. 

Harry Copson, President of the University's Students' Union said: 'It is unfortunate that in this instance the guidance we provided has not been implemented in the way that we would hope for as a Students’ Union, to ensure enjoyment and comfort for all our members. 

'I must however stress that the issue in question has come about as a result of negligence by a minority, and stress that the Students’ Union wishes not to undermine the brilliant hard work put in by all members of the Week One team, including both students and staff.' 

This follows an investigation at the London School of Economics after a leaflet was distributed to students looking to join the university's rugby club which was deemed racist, sexist and homophobic. The LSE's Students' Union disbanded the club for the rest of the academic year in response to the leaflet. 

Meanwhile at the University of Exeter, Freshers were forced to kiss a dead conger eel as well as drink beer from a shoe as part of an initiation ceremony. 

The Nottingham University students are the latest group to exhibit bad behaviour during Freshers' Week
