A new robot that moves just like a salamander has been created by engineers.

The robot, called Pleurobot, walks and swims in a life-like way that mimics the shy amphibious creatures.

It was developed by recording 3D X-ray videos of short-ribbed salamanders - Europe's largest salamander - allowing researchers to track 64 points on the animal skeleton.

Scientists behind the robot, which has 27 movable joints, believe it could be used to help palaeontolgists understand how extinct animals like the dinosaurs moved.

A video released by Google's Boston Dynamics sparked complaints after an engineer kicked one of its dog-like robots to show off its ability to remain upright.

Viewers said the robot had been mistreated and claimed the employees were being cruel.

It sparked a debate about whether it was possible to be cruel to a robot.

Ethicists and robotics experts waded into the argument to explain the only way it could be unethical would be if the robot could feel pain.

Others pointed out it is impossible for robots to have feelings.

They say as it is able to cope with a range of different terrain and squeeze through relatively small spaces, the robot could also be used to help search for people trapped in disaster zones.

And they added that the robots highly flexible spine also allows it to swim in water, but only if it is given a waterproof skin.

Professor Auke Jan Ijspeert, a researcher at the biorobotics laboratory at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EFPL), has been leading the development of the robot.

According to the group's website: 'Because of its low centre of mass and segmented legs it can navigate over rough terrain without losing balance. 

'With a waterproof skin it can also swim. 

'Those features may one day enable Pleurobot to help in search and rescue operations. 

'On the other hand, salamanders are a good living analog for the first tetrapods that made the transition from water to land.

'In the future, we plan to use Pleurobot's design methodology to bring early tetrapods to "life".'

Its engineers say that because it is able to cope with a range of different terrain and squeeze through relatively small spaces, the robot (pictured) could be used to help search for people trapped in disaster zones

Salamanders are remarkable creatures capable of regenerating limbs and researchers at University College London (UCL) recently identified the biological pathway involved. 

Called ERK (Extracellular signal-regulated kinases), the pathway must be constantly active for salamander cells to regenerate - a process not seen in the same way in other mammals.

Although a long way from achieving the same feat in humans, the discovery could help researchers unlock the ‘regenerative potential’ of cells across other animals.
