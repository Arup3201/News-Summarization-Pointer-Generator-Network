The space agency Nasa has put multi-billion observatories into orbit to study the stars - but its latest space telesope may be a little more budget-friendly.

Nasa scientist Maxim Markevitch and his team aim to build an X-Ray telescope based on rolls of plastic tape - inspired, Markevitch says, by Scotch tape.

‘I remember looking at a roll of Scotch tape and thinking, 'was it possible to use the same design for capturing hard X-rays,' said Markevitch. ‘I talked with a few people, and to my surprise, they didn't see any principal reasons why it couldn't be done.’

Stuck together with Sellotape? Maxim Markevitch claims that a telescope made of sticky tape could be a viable new way to look for X-Rays from the distant galaxy

Markevitch and a team of X-ray optics 
experts at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, have begun 
investigating the feasibility of fashioning a low-cost mirror from 
plastic tape and tightly rolling it like the sticky adhesive commonly 
found in most homes and offices.

‘Maxim's Scotch tape idea is in an 
early stage,’ Zhang said. ‘In the next year, we will know whether it has
a chance of working.’

If it does, it could prove 
‘game-changing for hard X-ray astronomy,’ Markevitch said. ‘It could 
significantly reduce the cost of building large mirrors, bringing within
reach the possibility of building a mirror with 10 to 30 times greater 
effective area than current X-ray telescopes.’

With funding from NASA's Center Innovation Fund, the team now is pursuing Markevitch's ‘early-stage’ idea and has already begun testing candidate materials that could be fashioned into a rolled mirror capable of collecting X-rays — in itself a challenging proposition.

To capture these ever-elusive photons, the mirrors must be curved and nested inside a cylindrical optical assembly.

The rounded geometry allows the high-energy light to graze their surfaces, much like a stone skimming the surface of a pond.

X-Ray universe: Over the past few decades, NASA has launched several X-ray observatories sensitive to lower-energy ¿soft X-rays,¿ including the Chandra X-ray Observatory, which took this picture

Over the past few decades, NASA has launched several X-ray observatories sensitive to lower-energy ‘soft X-rays,’ including the Chandra X-ray Observatory. They discovered and imaged the faint, diffuse X-ray signal from a variety of astrophysical sources dominated by thermal emission, such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies.

Other missions, like NASA's Swift satellite, were sensitive to higher-energy gamma rays, but they lacked imaging capabilities.

‘There remains a large and totally unexplored discovery space of faint, diffuse nonthermal astrophysical objects emitting at high X-ray energies,’ Markevitch said.

One class of objects waiting to be better understood is cosmic rays — highly energetic subatomic particles generated in deep space — that reside in galaxy clusters and other large-scale structure in the universe.

Scientists believe that cosmic rays and the magnetic fields between galaxy clusters can alter the physics within galaxy clusters.

A better understanding of these physics could reveal more about the birth and evolution of the cosmos, Markevitch said.

To study cosmic rays, however, observatories would have to be tuned to hard X-rays.

Although NASA's recently launched Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) and Japan's New X-ray Telescope, also known as Astro-H, are sensitive to hard X-rays, Markevitch said they only ‘will graze the surface of this discovery space.

’Because the signal is so faint, only an imaging X-ray telescope with a collecting area 30 times larger than that of NuSTAR, working with current and future radio telescopes, could do the job, Markevitch said.

‘However, to our knowledge, nothing of the kind is planned or even proposed in the U.S. or elsewhere because of the cost something like this presents,’ he said.

The only solution then is developing a new technology that would dramatically reduce the cost of building X-ray optics and increase the size of the light-collecting area. ‘If we can build a mirror that's big enough, this might be the way to go,’ he said.
