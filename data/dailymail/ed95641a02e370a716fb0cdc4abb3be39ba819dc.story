John Boye and Andre Ayew scored as Ghana came from behind to defeat South Africa 2-1 and seal their progress to the quarter-finals of the African Nations Cup.

Both teams were facing elimination from the tournament following Mandla Masango's fantastic first-half strike, but Boye gave Avram Grant's side hope in the 73rd minute.

Ayew's header seven minutes from time ensured the four-times winners progressed as Group C winners, with Algeria also reaching the knockout stages, while Bafana Bafana finished bottom of their group with just a solitary point.

Ephraim Mashaba's men needed to win and hope Algeria lost to Senegal if they were to progress while the Black Stars only needed to defeat South Africa in Mongomo.

South Africa were forced into desperate defending early on when Eric Mathoho brilliantly cleared off the line from Jordan Ayew, whose first strike was parried back into his path by goalkeeper Nhlanhla Khuzwayo.

Ghana's profligacy came back to haunt them as Ephraim Mashaba's men took the lead in sensational style in the 17th minute.

There appeared to be little danger when Masango fell after flicking on, but when the ball was headed back into his path, the Kaizer Chiefs forward was up in a flash and backpedalled before unleashing a volley over Brimah Razak.

It raised South Africa's hopes of progression but Ghana responded well, with Daniel Amartey missing with a header and Khuzwayo pulling off another excellent save from Baba Rahman's strike.

South Africa, though, remained a threat going forward and Razak kept the deficit to one at the interval with a fine stop from Bongani Ndulula's downward header.

Asamoah Gyan's free-kick went just over while Jordan Ayew's effort had Khuzwayo struggling to tip round the post, but otherwise Ghana struggled going forward.

Both sides were facing the prospect of going out, with Algeria's lead over Senegal thwarting South Africa's hopes, but Ghana gave themselves a lifeline in the 73rd minute.

Andre Ayew's cross-cum-shot fell into the path of Boye, who turned and slotted home to level matters.

The goal galvanised Ghana and they nearly took the lead immediately afterwards as Kwesi Appiah's long range strike was tipped onto the post by Khuzwayo.

But it proved not to matter as they scored again seven minutes from time, with Andre Ayew just getting to Rahman's left-wing cross ahead of Khuzwayo to head into an empty net.

Seconds later, Algeria doubled their lead against Senegal to ensure both they and Ghana progressed.
