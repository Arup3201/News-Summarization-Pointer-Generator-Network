A young George W. Bush once had a
blind date with the daughter of President Richard Nixon - but the romantic liaison didn't go as well as his father might have hoped.

The elder Bush was a member of the House of Representatives
from Texas in the late 1960s when he arranged for his son to take Tricia Nixon to dinner.

Bush recalls the incident in an anecdote-filled book being released this week about his father, former president George H.W. Bush, called '41 - A Portrait of My Father.'

George W. Bush describes the unfortunate blind date his father set up with Richard Nixon's daughter Tricia

He describes how as a young man he made his first-ever
trip to the White House to pick Tricia up - but the date seemed doomed from that point onward.

'During dinner, I reached for some butter, knocked over a
glass, and watched in horror as the stain of red wine crept
across the table,' George W. writes.

'Then I fired up a cigarette, prompting a
polite suggestion from Tricia that I not smoke,' he wrote. 'The
date came to an end when she asked me to take her back to the
White House immediately after dinner.'

The book also deals with the heart-wrenching moment that Bush learned that his little sister Robin had died from leukemia aged just three years old.

In an extract published in The Times, Bush writes that he has a 'vivid memory' of that day, when his parents arrived at his school in the middle of the day seven months after Robin had been diagnosed.

'As I sprinted over to the car, I thought that I saw Robin's blond curls in the backseat,' he continues. 'I was so excited that she had come home. But when I got to the car, she wasn't there.

'Mother hugged me tight and told me that she was gone. On the drive home, I saw my parents cry for the first time.' 

Bush calls the book, named 41 because his father was the 41st president, a 'love story' about his father.

In it, he writes of the family's concern when the elder Bush
declared his intention to go on a parachute jump to mark his
90th birthday earlier this year. 

Asked what his birthday wish
was as he prepared to jump, George H.W. Bush said: 'Make sure
the parachute opens.'

Bush also writes that
his father, who was in the White House from 1988 to 1992 and his staff should have been more active in
explaining to Americans why he broke his 'no new taxes' pledge
as part of a 1990 budget agreement.

The issue seriously hurt the
Republican president among conservatives and was a factor when
he lost his 1992 re-election bid to Democrat Bill Clinton.

'By taking the issue to the people, a president can build up
public support and change minds in Washington,' George W. writes.

'Unfortunately,
George Bush did not do that for the budget agreement of 1990,
and the bitterness that resulted from his broken pledge damaged
his standing within the party.'

Another section dealing with Vladimir Putin shows that Bush Snr was continuing to play a part on the world stage well into his 80s.

Although the two almost talk politics, George W Bush would still use his father to help host world leaders - such as Putin in 2007, according to a preview of the book by Drudge Report.

In an excerpt from the book, Bush told how he asked his father to invite Putin to the family compound at Walker's Point, Maine, so the two leaders could talk about missile defense programs.

In a surreal episode, Bush Snr, then 83, took Putin into the Atlantic on a speedboat. While the idea 'startled' the Russian leader at first, he 'loved' being driven at top-speed by the octogenarian politician when the time came. 

Elsewhere the book shows how a shocked Bush Snr told President Nixon to resign after learning he would lose an impeachment hearing over revelations he lied to the American people.

Bush Snr, then chairman of the Republican National Committee, sent a letter to Nixon urging him quit for his own good and that of the country, according to a preview of the book by Drudge Report.

It said: 'I now firmly feel that resignation is best for this country, best for this President... If you do leave office, history will properly record your achievements with a lasting respect'. 

The elder Bush had a serious illness two years ago.

In December 2012, he was hospitalized with pneumonia. The
family feared the worst and gathered at his bedside. The elder
Bush put his hand on granddaughter Jenna's pregnant belly and
said, 'There's death and there's new life.'

'We all left the room sobbing,' Bush writes.
