Swansea director John van Zweden believes Wilfried Bony will be wasted at new side Manchester City as he will just sit on the bench.

Bony sealed a £25million move to City from the south Wales side earlier this month and the fee could rise to £28m after add-ons.

And while Van Zweden admits the 26-year-old's departure is a huge loss to Garry Monk's side, he thinks the Ivory Coast star will play second fiddle to Sergio Aguero and Co at the Etihad Stadium.

He said: 'We will miss the goals from Wilfried Bony a lot. The most frustrating thing is that he will sit on the Manchester City bench.

Wilfried Bony joined Manchester City from Swansea earlier this month

The 26-year-old was the top scorer in the Premier League during 2014 - netting 20 goals for his former side

Wayne Rooney (Manchester United) - 16

Edin Dzeko (Manchester City) - 14 

Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool) - 13

'Sergio Aguero remains their main striker. I'd personally love Wilfried to be at the heart of a top club like City.' 

Van Zweden also believes the highly-rated forward left the Swans on the cheap - despite his huge price tag.

He added: 'If Manchester United were able to get as much as they did for Luke Shaw, then the money they have paid for Bony, the Premier League’s top scorer in 2014, is still on the very low side.'

Bony could make his debut for City in the top-of-the-table clash with Chelsea this Saturday, if his country crash out of the Africa Cup of Nations when they play Cameroon on Wednesday.
