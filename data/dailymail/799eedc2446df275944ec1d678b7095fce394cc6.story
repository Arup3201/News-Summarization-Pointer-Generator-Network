An American couple held in Qatar on child abuse charges since January have been freed from jail as they prepare their defense against charges that could see them both executed in the Persian Gulf nation.Â 

As of Wednesday, Matthew and Grace Huang are free to move about Qatar but cannot return home unless they are found not-guilty in a ruling likely to come in December.

The Los Angeles natives are accused of starving their adopted daughter Gloria to death so they could sell her organs. Gloria was adopted from Ghana at age 4.

The couple's family and lawyers said the charges are the result of cultural misunderstandings about international adoptions and faulty forensic evidence.

The family's lawyers say they have not been allowed to present the Huang's side of the case since the could were arrested in January.

On Tuesday, after a hearing by a four-judge panel, the chief judge announced in Arabic 'You have been set free,' Al-Jazeera reports.

If the couple are convicted of starving their daughter to death, they could potentially be sentenced to death - though Qatar has had a de-facto moratorium on executions for the past ten years.

At a hearing Wednesday, family friends testified about having lunch with the Huangs and their three adopted children days before Gloria's death.

They said the couple made sure that all of their children ate.

Their lawyers will now submit summaries of the evidence of the couple's innocence to the judges.

They will meet in secret to review the evidence and the testimony and are expected to render a verdict in December.

The Huangs claim Gloria was from medical problems complicated by anorexia-like bouts.

The case has brought legal support and other aid from Californian groups, where the couple lived until 2012, and has highlighted potential cultural misunderstandings in a Gulf nation unfamiliar with adoption.

The prosecution alleges the couple 
denied food to their daughter Gloria, who was born in Ghana and adopted 
at the age of four. They also claim she was locked in her room at night.

The couple say the girl had various 
medical problems and also erratic eating habits, including periods of 
binging and self-starvation.

They say she was not allowed from her
room at night because of bizarre behavior during eating sprees, 
including rummaging through garbage for food.

She would also try to leave the house
at night in search of food and pick through the medicine cabinet on 
late-night binges, according to a report prepared in the U.S. by Janice 
Ophoven, a pediatric forensic psychologist who reviewed the case for the
family.

The behavior is not uncommon in adopted children who have suffered from severe malnutrition in their past, the report says.

Gloria,
who was slight for her age, also had been treated for an intestinal 
parasite, and recent blood tests had showed severely low levels of a 
certain type of white blood cell that could have been a sign of an 
underlying bone marrow condition, as well as a vitamin D deficiency.

When Gloria died, she was in an anorexic episode and had not eaten in as many as four days, Ophoven wrote in her report.

A Qatari doctor who conducted Gloria's 
autopsy found that the child's hips, ribs and spine protruded and 
concluded the cause of death was dehydration and wasting disease.

Supporters
in the U.S. say those diagnoses aren't possible and don't take into 
account the child's long history of eating disorders and malnourishment 
that caused lifelong health concerns, as well as recent blood work.

Officials in Qatar also have raised questions about the adoption procedures, including payments to an adoption agency.

This is likely because adoption is 
virtually unknown in traditional Gulf Arab societies, where extended 
families would provide care.

In addition, an investigative report 
by Qatari police raised questions about why the Huangs would adopt 
children who did not share their 'hereditary traits' and raised concerns
that the children were part of a human trafficking operation or were 
'bought' for organ harvesting, according to the family's website.

Matthew Huang was working on water 
engineering projects as part of infrastructure improvements for Qatar's 
hosting of the 2022 World Cup.

The couple has two other children adopted from Africa.

'We are innocent,' Mr Huang told reporters 
after a hearing. 'We are suffering. I hope to be reunited with 
my wife and children soon.'
