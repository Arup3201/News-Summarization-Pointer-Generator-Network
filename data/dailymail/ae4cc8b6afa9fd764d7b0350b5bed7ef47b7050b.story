A man and a woman have been arrested after they were caught on tape planting a fake bomb at a school in East Hampton, New York, as a joke after a big night out.

Sean Doran and Kayla Sypek, both 20, are accused of leaving the device near the front entrance of East Hampton Middle School at around 1:45 a.m. on Saturday.

According to police, staff discovered the makeshift weapon at around 8:30 a.m. as they were preparing to open the school for a youth basketball competition.

Charged: Sean Doran, left, and Kayla Sypek, right, both 20, are accused of leaving the device near the front entrance of East Hampton Middle School on Saturday morning

Police immediately locked down the school and secured the area after the phoney weapon was reported.

The
makeshift bomb was red and orange, approximately 12 inches by 8 inches 
by 4 inches with a clock on top and covered in plastic.

The Connecticut State Police Bomb Squad was called in and determined the suspicious item did not contain any explosives. Police said the school was checked for any other possible dangerous items and was then deemed safe.

They have both been charged with reckless endangerment, threatening and breach of peace.

Authorities
from the Federal Bureau of Investigation are also investigating the 
case and Doran and Sypek could face federal charges.

Found: The device was found by school staff near the front entrance of East Hampton Middle School, pictured

They were held on a $100,000 bond each and arraigned in Middlesex Superior Court on Monday.

The two suspects walked out of the courthouse with jackets over their heads and surrounded by family members.

When a reporter asked Sypek whether she had anything to say, the woman replied: 'How about "bite me."'

'It's taxpayers money because of my 
client's foolish actions,' said Doran's attorney Gerald Klein told WFSB Eyewitness News.

'But, the judge in characterizing these actions didn't 
call it devious or malicious or anything like that. She called it 
exactly what his parents have been telling me, a stupid, foolish act.'

Sypek's attorney, Mike Epright, 
added: 'There's a lot sensitivity right now with Newtown and its on 
everybody's minds right now. But at the same time, I think its important
that everyone does a fact check and at the end of the day not to 
overreact to something that's just bad judgement.'

Reckless: Both have been charged with reckless endangerment, threatening and breach of peace

The suspects were identified in a 
school security video, which showed the couple's silver, four-door 
vehicle pull up to the school gate at around 1:45 a.m. and Doran jump 
out, leaving the bomb-like device at the school entrance.

Doran and Sypek were located at 
around 12:30 p.m. in their car, and the man was wearing the same plaid 
shirt shown in the video, officers said. Also in the vehicle was the couple's 2-year-old daughter.

The couple  confessed to the 
crime, saying they found the 'fake bomb' at a paintball compound before 
placing it at the school. 

Doran's father Stephen Doran is also facing charges after he allegedly struck a female reporter outside the courthouse where his son was being arraigned on Monday.

The 50-year-old is charged with third-degree assault and second-degree criminal mischief.

Sypek, who previously worked at a daycare facility in east Hampton, wrote on her Facebook on Monday night that 'real friends and family are all that matter.'

She went on: 'Shows who knows u and who doesnt. I love everyone that takes the time to talk to and listen to me about everything and realizes me or sean are not a terrorist (sic).

'I am so sorry for everything and it is something i will b living with the rest of my life i legit cant apologize enuf and know every sory in the world wont change what happened. But it happened and its time for some sierous changes (sic).

'It may not be easy to ignore everyone of u but its easy for it to not affect me when i know the real story (sic).'

At 8:48 a.m. on Saturday, before the fake-bomb discovery was made public, Sypek wrote on her Facebook page: 'Muchhh fun last nitee :)'
