Bank of England Governor Mark Carney addressed the TUC Congress at the BT Convention Centre, Liverpool today

Sharing the pound is ‘incompatible’ with independence, the Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said today.

Mr Carney said a separate Scotland could not forge a currency union with the rest of the UK because it needed a shared central bank and controls over public spending.

The Bank chief, speaking at the Trades Union Conference in Liverpool, warned that without these in place Scotland would risk a Eurozone-style crisis.

Mr Carney’s remarks are a significant intervention against the Scottish National Party’s plans for independence.

Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond has insisted that the Government is bluffing that it will block a formal currency union after independence.

The ‘No’ campaign against intervention will hope to use Mr Carney’s remarks to convince wavering Scottish voters that they risk losing the pound in the event of independence.

In January Mr Carney warned that a currency union – like the Eurozone - ‘requires some ceding of national sovereignty’. Today, he went even further, declaring: ‘A currency union is incompatible with sovereignty.’

Unions in favour of Scotland staying within the UK welcomed the comments.

Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB, said: ‘The comments were a breath of fresh air.

‘People keep talking about whether there is a Plan B or Plan C, but there aren't any, because it is incompatible, as the governor has made clear.’

Mr Carney said there had to be three things in place to make a currency union work.

He said these were the free movement of goods and services across the different parts of the currency, a banking union underpinned by common institutions such as a central bank, and controls on spending.

The subject of currency has been a political battleground after George Osborne said earlier this summer that an independent Scotland could not keep the pound.

Only this weekend Mr Osborne reiterated the prospect of a currency union.

The Chancellor said: ‘No ifs, no buts, we will not share the pound if Scotland separated from the rest of the UK.’

That position has been backed by both Labour and the Lib Dems.

SNP leaders have refused to offer a ‘Plan B’ alternative to a continued formal currency union.

Mr Osborne's threat to block a currency union was trumped this weekend by a stark warning from the Labour leader Ed Miliband that border guards could be deployed in the event of a 'Yes' vote.

He said: ‘If you don’t want borders, vote to stay in the United Kingdom.'

Asked whether that would mean him introducing border guards and passport checks if he was Prime Minister, Mr Miliband warned: ‘It would have to be looked at.’

And Mr Miliband’s spokesman added: ‘The last time I looked there were two sides to the border – and we would be in charge of one of them. It would be up to us, not Mr Salmond, to secure our northern border.’
