An adorable video of a father dueting with his tiny one-year-old son has captured hearts across the world with more than 300,000 views in just three days.

Diogo Mello, 1, from Brazil, was filmed playing the Beatles 'Don't Let Me Down' on his ukelele alongside his father Christian Diego Mello, who then posted it on YouTube on Thursday.

The double act showcases already musical Diogo, who will be turning two in a
month, showing off a big voice and early strumming skills.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Duet with dad: Diogo Mello's dad Christian posted a video to YouTube of himself singing and duet with his almost-two-year-old son three days ago which has been viewed more than 300,000 times

Proud dad Christian accompanies his 
son on guitar, pausing to let Diogo shout the chorus enthusiastically, 
and occasionally prompting him with the lyrics.

The pair are an accomplished 
covers double act who have been performing Beatles hits together almost since Diogo's birth.

The comments section for the video has lit up with people enchanted by cute little Diogo, and congratulating his father for teaching him the 'classics' early.

'How beautiful!' wrote Hailson Reis Souza Silv. 'The world really is not lost. This little boy is very talented and has good taste in music too!'

'Rock is still alive!' wrote Danilo Alencar.

'Great! You didn't let me down!' commented Marluce Fagotti.

Little boy, big voice: Many of little Diogo Mello's new fans are hoping his dad posts some more YouTube videos of the tiny rocker

Christian Mello responded to his young son's fans on the page, 'I'm his Daddy!'

'Very proud of him. Big hug!'

Diogo appears to be performing in his pyjamas. It is unclear whether or not a Yoko Ono figure stepped in and broke up the jam session to send the budding musician to bed.
