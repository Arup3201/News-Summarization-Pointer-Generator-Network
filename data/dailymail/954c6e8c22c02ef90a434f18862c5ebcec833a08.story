The heat is on and there are contrasting statements from some of the Premier League’s most prominent managers.

Manuel Pellegrini loftily announces that he has no need to win trophies to keep his job at Manchester City.

Brendan Rodgers openly admits that unless he had put Liverpool back in the running for honours he would have been sacked.

Louis van Gaal urgently instructs his Manchester United players to minimise passes back to their goalkeeper in an attempt to pacify fans who are demanding a return to the attacking style of Sir Alex Ferguson.

Roberto Martinez airily falls back on the support of his chairman Bill Kenwright as Everton drift, as if rudderless, towards the rapids of the drop zone.

Get real, Senors Pellegrini and Martinez.

Right on, Mister Rodgers and Meneer Van Gaal.

Complacency has never been a recipe for security in the football management game and you begin to fear for Pellegrini and Martinez as the season heads towards the home straight.

Pellegrini’s calm intelligence and fine football principles have won our admiration but he is kidding himself if he truly believes it when he says: ‘I’m not under any pressure to win titles. It’s about playing with style. We won’t change. It’s not about my relationship with the owners. They are not so desperate to win.’

Oh, really? Good luck with that one if after they spend so much money you come up short of Chelsea in your defence of the Premier League title and Barca finish you off in the Champions League. And it didn’t look that good against gallant Leicester on Wednesday night.

Martinez comes across as honest – albeit painfully so at times – as well as a smooth media operator but he may be taking a little too much for granted when he says: ‘I was always aware of the support I would get from the chairman.’

Roberto Martinez has suffered second season syndrome at Everton with the Toffees perilously perched

Brendan Rodgers was candid about his chances of survival before Liverpool's remarkable turnaround

Beware the good old vote of confidence, Roberto, and let’s hope you don’t come to re-evaluate something else you’ve just said about Mr Kenwright: ‘Bill is a mad Evertonian.’

Fanatical fans are not usually very forgiving of only one win in a run of a dozen games including that tepid defeat at Stoke.

Rodgers and Van Gaal, meanwhile, are sensibly watching their backs.

Not long ago I had occasion to chide Rodgers in this column for doing too much talking about himself but seemingly not enough work on a Liverpool team sliding into crisis. Since then he has seen the warning signs and cleverly switched to a positive 3-4-3 formation which has turned them into the form team of the Premier League and he freely declares now: ‘I’ve learned that if the team is not functioning it doesn’t matter how much support you have in the boardroom. You have to win.’

So it’s well done to him.

Since losing to United on December 14, Liverpool have won nine and drawn three in the Premier League

Van Gaal is proving himself shrewd enough to know that sometimes not even a run of only two defeats in 21 matches is enough at a club as huge as United. The Old Trafford faithful are chanting ‘attack, attack, attack’ while his raft of expensive imports – including £60million record signing Angel di Maria – are struggling to comes to terms with the quick-fire culture of the game in England. And the manager hears them: ‘I agree with the fans that we don’t have to use the goalkeeper so much. That there are times when we could play at a higher tempo.’

United are approaching a potentially season-defining sequence of matches against Spurs, Liverpool, City and Chelsea in the League and Arsenal in the FA Cup quarter-finals and he promises: ‘We can improve.’

So it’s well done to him, too.

This quartet are not the only managers sweating in the boiler room of big-time football.

Heaven knows, for example, what poor old Gus Poyet was burbling on about in his bottle-kicking rant during Sunderland’s fractious draw at Hull this midweek. Or whether his sanity will hold up under the pressure of fighting to stave off relegation without his star England winger Adam Johnson following his arrest on suspicion of having sex with an underage girl.

Hull boss Steve Bruce and Sunderland's Gus Poyet played down their spat and have since shaken hands

The trapdoor is beginning to creak under some auspicious names.

Don’t feel too sorry for them if it swings open.

Unlike the great managers of yore – even Sir Alex was financially strapped in his early years astride the hot seat – these celebrities are paid millions to cope with the pressures.

Like several of their more immediate predecessors, they would not necessarily be obliged to find another job after the pay-off.

It’s mostly the pride that’s in danger of being hurt.

There is one lesson above all others which England’s rugby goliaths need to heed from that Six Nations defeat in Ireland.

Brawn alone will not be enough to win the World Cup this autumn, even on home turf.

Stuart Lancaster’s pack is a monster, right enough, but you cannot simply shove, bore and batter your way to glory against the best teams on the planet in the Test matches which matter above all others.

England will need more than a game based around brute force if they are to succeed in the World Cup

Ireland gave Chris Robshaw his men a lesson and the Red Rose will need to regroup - and add guile

You have to play some football, at least, when it comes to Ireland, probably France, even more so New Zealand.

Sir Clive Woodward had Martin Johnson the Enforcer but he also got the sparkling best out of Jonny Wilkinson, whose phenomenal kicking blinded many to his creative talents.

Lancaster has Chris Robshaw the Mighty. He also has at his disposal the mercurial genius of Danny Cipriani, who he leaves parked on the bench.

There is no reward without risk.

There was an awed reaction to my reminiscence earlier this week of how Tottenham’s late, great Dave Mackay refused to believe he had broken his left leg for a second time until he stamped his foot and the jagged white bone stuck out through his sock…then spurned the stretcher and insisted on walking off.

So don’t be too surprised if this much loved and revered iron Scot arrives at the funeral on his own two feet.
