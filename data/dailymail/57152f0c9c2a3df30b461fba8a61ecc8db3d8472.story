Matt Damon’s new sci-fi blockbuster 'Elysium' has received a deluge of criticism that it is pushing a socialist agenda - inspired by the Occupy movement - down moviegoers’ throats.

Set in the year 2154, ‘Elysium’ imagines a world where the wealthy elite have abandoned an overcrowded Earth for a better life aboard a luxury space station.

While Earth is characterized by crime-riddled and poverty-stricken slums, the super-rich live in Elysium, an exclusive gated community in space complete with a cure for all illnesses and robots that enforce strict anti-immigration laws.

The extreme disparity between the haves and have nots in the movie bears strong parallels with the Occupy movement’s fight against social and economic inequality and the vilification of the one per cent.

The Hollywood Reporter has called it a ‘politically charged flight of speculative fiction’, while Newsmax has escribed it as ‘political propaganda’ and 'sci-fi socialism.'

Variety said it is one of the ‘more openly socialist political agendas of any Hollywood movie in memory, beating the drum loudly not just for universal healthcare, but for open borders, unconditional amnesty and the abolition of class distinctions as well.’

The film’s star – and renowned Hollywood liberal - Matt Damon has denied that it has an overtly political message.

‘I don’t think it is trying to say anything. It just presents the issue – the distinct difference between the haves and the have nots,’ he told Fox.

The movie’s director Neill Blomkamp has also denied that he wanted to be a political statement and said it is unfortunate that parallels had been drawn with the Occupy movement.

But critics have rubbished their denials.

‘It’s not just hypocritical to say this movie isn’t political, it’s hilarious. This is just the latest of several Hollywood movies this year to try and co-opt Occupy Wall Street plotlines into their films,” Dan Gainor, VP of Business and Culture at the Media Research Center, told FOX.

The scenes on earth and supposedly set in Los Angeles a century and a half from now were filmed in Mexico, while luxury space station was based on real designs for how habitable space station might look.

Future life? The concept of people living in space stations is something that NASA has been working on since the 1970s

NASA estimates that it would cost about $828.11 billion to build a space station capable of sustaining life

This premise of people living in space might seem far-fetched considering how man's interest in space exploration has waned in the 30 years, but it could soon be within our reach.

NASA has been working on designs since the 1970s. In 1975, a report titled 'Space Settlements: A Design Study' was created in an attempt to detail the costs and needs of life in space.

The estimated price tag of a space station was about $190.8 billion, in 1975 dollars. Adjusting for inflation, the cost jumps to about $828.11 billion.

'The future takes imagination, you have to extrapolate for the technology we have today. Within the next 1000 years, the type of technology used to support a space station like Elysium could be developed,' Mark Uhran, former director of the International Space Station Division at NASA headquarters, told ABC News.

'We’re already demonstrating some of this technology on the international space station today.'
