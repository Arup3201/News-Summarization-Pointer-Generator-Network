A man wanting to sell his second-hand car was inundated with would-be buyers after he used a mannequin that looks like a blow-up doll to pose beside it.

Angus Dean, 47, from East Grinstead, Sussex, thought using the doll would help get the advert for his old VW Golf noticed.

He borrowed Sandy, a friend's doll, and posed her in a variety of positions next to his 1990 hatchback before uploading them to eBay, with an initial bid of 99p invited, or the option to buy it now for £450.

Mr Dean, 47, from East Grinstead, Sussex, said he wanted to make his car advert stand out from the rest

As well as being pictured opening the car door and sitting in the driver's seat, Sandy was also used to point out the areas of rust on the Mk2 1.8-litre model.

Mr Dean, an estate manager, said: 'I thought it was a great idea and I’ve had people ringing up about it.

'We did the same with a ride-on mower, and it sold straight away.

'The car needs a bit of work to get it back on the road, but it's a future classic. Hopefully the doll will help sell it.'

The doll's owner, a married father-of-three who asked not to be named, said he uses the doll for professional purposes because they come 'without the fuss' of the real model.

He said: 'I've asked models if they would pose for eBay adverts before and most aren’t interested in it.

'Poseable mannequins are ready, and do what you need them to do. You don’t get the fuss you might get with models.

The doll, known as 'Sandy' is owned by a friend of Mr Dean's - he uses her to make eye-catching eBay adverts

More rust: The original buyer failed to materialise with the cash so Mr Dean has re-listed his car on eBay today

'You don’t need to feed them or pick them up from the train station and you don’t need to pay them any royalties.

'There are an enormous number of cars for sale and the mannequins are a way to grab your attention.'

The advert, listed as ‘Classic VW Golf 1.8, MK2’, was uploaded to eBay again today after the previous buyer didn’t come forward to pay.
