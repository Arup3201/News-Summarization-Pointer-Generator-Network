For years scientists have debated whether an asteroid, climate change or a combination of catastrophes were responsible for the demise of dinosaurs.

Now experts believe that the majority of the prehistoric creatures were wiped out by a perfect storm of ‘colossal bad luck’.

Dinosaurs might have survived the asteroid strike that led to their extinction if it had come slightly earlier or later in history, they said.

Dinosaurs might have survived the asteroid strike that led to their extinction (illu8strated) if it had come slightly earlier or later in history. Experts say that the creatures were killed by 'colossal bad luck' as they were already weakened by a changing climate and did not have time to adapt

But when the six-mile-wide (10km) asteroid hit what is now Mexico approximately 66 million years ago, dinosaurs were experiencing environmental upheaval, which left them vulnerable.

The new study by an international team of palaeontologists led by the University of Edinburgh looked at an updated catalogue of dinosaur fossils, mostly from North America.

They found that widespread volcanic activity, changing sea levels and varying temperatures had weakened the dinosaurs’ food chain when disaster struck.

If the asteroid impact had come a few million years earlier, when the range of species was bigger and food chains more robust, they may have survived, according to the study, which was published in the journal Biological Reviews.

Many scientists agree that a six-mile-wide (10km) asteroid that struck what is now Mexico 66 million years ago, led to the dying of the majority of dinosaurs.

The new study says that if it had struck a few million years earlier or later, prehistoric creatures such as the T.Rex may have survived.

Experts studied fossils to find that widespread volcanic activity, changing sea levels and varying temperatures had weakened the dinosaurs’ food chain when disaster struck.

If the asteroid impact had come a few million years earlier, when the range of species was bigger and food chains more robust, they may have survived.

Likewise, if it had come later in history when new species had been given the chance to evolve, they might have escaped extinction.

But when the asteroid struck - causing tsunamis, earthquakes, wildfires, sudden temperature swings and other environmental changes - the already weakened dinosaur kingdom was wiped out one species after another.

The only dinosaurs to survive were those that could fly, which evolved to become the birds of today.

Dr Steve Brusatte, of the University of Edinburgh’s School of Geo Sciences, said: ‘The dinosaurs were victims of colossal bad luck.

‘Not only did a giant asteroid strike, but it happened at the worst possible time, when their ecosystems were vulnerable.

‘Our new findings help clarify one of the enduring mysteries of science.’

Dr Richard Butler, from the University of Birmingham, said there was nothing to suggest that dinosaurs were doomed to extinction when the asteroid hit.

‘Without that asteroid, the dinosaurs would probably still be here, and we very probably would not,’ he added.

It is hoped that that ongoing studies in Spain and China will aid even better understanding of what occurred.
