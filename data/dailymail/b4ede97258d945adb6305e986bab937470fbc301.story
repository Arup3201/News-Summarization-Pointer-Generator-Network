A man with a rare condition which means his scrotum is so big he struggles to walk is appealing for money to help pay for lifesaving surgery in America.

Tyrone Bowd, 24, from Willowbank in Queensland was diagnosed with scrotal lymphedema about 12 months ago. The agonising condition causes infections that cause his temperature to soar, his heart rate to increase and his body to turn septic.

His mother Tanya Bowd said her son’s quality of life was declining as his scrotum was already the size of a watermelon - and was still growing. 

Tryone Bowd's watermelon-sized penis caused him to have an accident on his motorbike earlier this year

‘As a mother the last 12 months have been emotional. I can’t sleep and I’m always doing research about how to help my son,’ she told the Courier Mail.

‘Some days I get to the point where I think we won’t get the help we need but as a mother I can’t stop. I’m 100 per cent committed to saving my son’s life.’

Ms Bowd said her son, who weighs 112kg who also has an inverted penis, had sought help from more than 100 medical professionals including doctors at Ipswich Hospital.

‘No one can help us in Australia,’ she said. ‘I had doctors discuss building a team to give surgery a go only to be told by a urologist that if I was to sign on the dotted line and allow anyone in Australia to operate I would be signing my son’s life away.’

She said her son no longer had any faith in doctors and was 'banging his head against a wall' in frustration that no one medical professional in Australia could help his heartbreaking situation.

'One response I got was they could give him a sex change but couldn’t repair his scrotum so I basically threw my hands in the air,' she said.

'A couple of doctors said they could build a team and give it a go and I said "it’s not a game of cricket mate, he’s not a guinea pig".'

His family were left with no choice but to hold a car drive in Ipswich, Queensland, this Saturday to raise funds for Tyrone to fly to California to undergo lifesaving surgery performed by Dr Joel Geldman.

Ms Bowd has been liaising with Dr Geldman who she said guaranteed that he and his medical team could perform an operation to save Tyrone’s life.

Wesley Warren famously had his scrotal lymphedema corrected by Dr Geldman after going public on shock jock Howard Stern's radio show to talk about the plight of his 45kg scrotum.

Mr Warren died in March after suffering two heart attacks when he was hospitalised due to complications from diabetes.

Dr Geldman, stated in an email to Ms Bowd that he had performed the procedure 175 times.

‘I’ve contacted Dr Geldman and I have had continuous correspondence with him,’ she said. ‘He has been monitoring Tyrone’s condition via medical reports CT scans, ultrasounds and photographs.’

Mr Warren had never travelled to tropical areas and believed the condition was down to an accident in 2008, when he caught his testicles with his leg while twisting in bed.  

Ms Bowd said that maintaining a normal family life was difficult.

'Tyrone needs help to go to the toilet and he has a lot of difficulty walking.

'He broke his leg in a motorbike accident earlier this year and that’s because his scrotum was a hindrance on the bike,' she said.

Tyrone and his dedicated mother, Tanya, who won't give up until her son has been cured of a heartbreaking condition

'His scrotum is so big that he can’t ride a bike anymore and family and friends pitched in to get him a quad bike.'

Ms Bowd said Tyrone had a heart of gold and rarely complained about the pain.

'He is always trying to make everyone he meets laugh, he loves fast cars, motor bikes, playing jokes, listening to music and spending time with people,' she said.
