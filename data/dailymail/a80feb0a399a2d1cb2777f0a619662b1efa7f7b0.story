The teenagers captured in a remarkable photo by Ringo Starr in 1964 were suspended as soon as they got back to High School.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline Bob Toth,66, shown in the passenger seat of the car said: ‘The principal certainly suspended me for three days as soon as we got back to school.

'The story didn’t even make it into the yearbook because he didn’t want to look like he was encouraging kids to cut school.’

Caught: Bob Toth (front passenger seat, left), Gary Van Deursen, (next to him) Suzanne Rayot, Arlene Norbe Ressler and Charlie Schwartz pictured by Ringo Starr on the day they cut class to see their idols The Beatles

Forty years later he met his former
 principal at church: ‘He said to me, “You know, in retrospect what you did that day
 was a very good idea."'

The search for the friends who 
skipped classes that day began after Ringo Starr, 73, wrote in his new 
book, 'Photograph' how much he would like to know who the teenagers 
were.

'It's just a great shot,' he wrote. 'They're looking at us, and I'm photographing them.'

It has now emerged that they were, from 
left, Bob Toth, Gary Van Deursen, Suzanne Rayot, Arlene Norbe Ressler, 
Charlie Scwartz and Matt Blender.

And Mr Toth admitted that he had no idea the photograph even existed until today. He said: ‘It’s kind of nice to have something legitimise the story we’ve all told on and off over the years.’

The way they were: Bob Toth,66, today pointing to himself in the Ringo Starr picture that has become a sensation. He was in the front of the car  next to best friend Gary Van Deursen, 67

No invention: Gary Van Deursen at his home in Connecticut holding a copy of the picture (he is circled) caught by Ringo Starr on February 7 1964

The car belonged to Mr Toth's best friend, Gary Van Deursen, 67, who today revealed himself to be the driver in the photograph.

He told MailOnline that none of his friends had believed his story until now.

The chance meeting took place on 
February 7, 1964 when The Beatles were to arrive at JFK, two days before their first appearance on 'The Ed Sullivan 
Show'.

Van Deursen explained: 'I took my Chevy convertible – it was white with a red interior. We cut school and decided we'd try to see The Beatles. It was so hyped so of course we got to the airport and it was mobbed.

'We went up to the top of the international building I believe it was. There was a crowd on the roof and reporters and one of my friends, Matt Blender, put on a British accent.

'A reporter overheard him and interviewed him life on the local radio. I was laughing so hard I had to move away.'

Skipping school: Van Deursen, pictured left in 
his yearbook, asked some of his friends if they wanted to miss class to 
see the band and they jumped into his car. They were also joined by 
Robert Toth, right

School Days: Charlie Schwartz (left) has also recounted the excitment of meeting Starr - but how no one believed them. He said that his closest friend from the group, Matt Blender (right) has since died

Highlight of their lives: Suzanne Rayot pictured in her yearbook in 1965, the year after that unforgettable day

He continued: 'As we were driving home, back across George Washington bridge a limousine passed us, then another, then another, then another and we realised it was The Beatles each in a separate limo.

'I crossed over lanes and overtook so they would all pass us again. The last one had Ringo Starr in it and the reporter from TIME magazine – though we didn't know that then.'

According to Mr Toth until then the friends had actually left JFK disappointed: ‘It was such a mad scene at 
JFK that we left disappointed because we just thought there was no way 
we’d get close to the band.

'Then we saw all these limousines as we were 
driving home and pretty soon realised it wasn’t a funeral it was the 
Beatles.’

Starr, he said, was ‘the friendly one,' who leaned out of the window and spoke over the screams of the 
two female passengers who, Toth laughed, could not contain their 
excitement.
He said: ‘Suzanne was behind me, screaming her lungs out. It was crazy.’

Mr Van Deursen continued: 'Ringo gestured to us to wind down the window so we did. He asked where we were from and one of the kids in the car held up his jacket with the school name on it because it was hard to hear Fair Lawn.

'We didn't have tickets to the show which was sold out and we asked Ringo if he could get us any. He said he was sorry he couldn't help.'

Youth: Arlene Norbe, circled, also joined the group in skipping school in an attempt to see the band

School days: Norbe is circled again. She is now believed to be living with her husband in New Jersey

Today the friends who drove to JFK 
that day are scattered across the country, but Mr Toth still lives in 
New Jersey where he works as a Senior Sales Engineer for an Air conditioning and Heating firm and lives with wife Nanci, 49.

Mr Van Deursen
 runs his own company as an inventor and designer. He lives in 
Connecticut with his wife, Alison, with whom he has a son and daughter. 
His career as an industrial designer and inventor has seen him live in 
Europe as Vice President and Head of Design for Black & Decker as 
well as Head of Design for General Electric and Coleman Outdoor Camping 
Equipment.

Principal Daniel A Rothermel: At the time he took a firm line on the teens'excursion. Years later he admitted, 'it was a good idea'

But however successful his career and
 life since that day on George Washington bridge he said: ‘It was the 
highlight of our lives really. Though I should say it was reported in 
TIME that I lost control of the car – I never did. Still we were glad 
when that piece came out.

'We
 had gone back to school and told everyone the story about how we had 
seen the Beatles and spoken to Ringo Starr and nobody believed us. They 
thought it was just some crazy story we were all making up.'

Schwartz has also spoken out about the once-in-a-life experience.

'We were hardcore rock-and-rollers,' Schwartz told the New Jersey Record. 'It was all about the music.'

Schwartz, then 17, had just arrived at 
the school student lounge when Van Deursen said he had a car and was
 going to drive to see the musicians.

Schwartz said: 'He said, "Are you in or are you out?" I said, "I'm in".'

They skipped class and headed to Queens.

But
 when they arrived it was madness so they were forced to turn the car 
around for the direction of home, they came across the group.

He recounted how they pulled up alongside Ringo's car and that the musician began snapping away at them.

He
 said he is no longer in touch with the others in the car and said 
that Blender - his closest friend - has since passed away, NewJersey.com
 reported.

Ringo's team has not yet contacted him, but the media has been knocking, he said.

Memories: Starr stands beside the image at Genesis Publications unveiling of the book on Wednesday

Fab Four: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr shot to stardom as The Beatles

'The
 whole thing seems quite surreal, but it’s a gas,' he said. 'It's a lot 
of fun. I've talked to people I haven't talked to for quite a while. 
I’ve gotten calls from all around the country.'

The Beatle had put out an appeal for the group, hoping that someone would recognize them.

The picture is being published for the first time in Starr’s new book Photograph, along with over 200 never-before-seen shots.

The Beatles formed in 
Liverpool in the late 1950s with their most famous line-up being John 
Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr.

The group’s first big hit in the States was I Want To Hold Your Hand, which sold 1.5 million copies in less than three weeks.

A
 crowd of thousands greeted them at the airport in New York when they 
arrived for their tour and one radio station even aired a running 
commentary on the event.

Their
 first gig in America took place in Washington DC and their first US TV 
appearance – on the Ed Sullivan Show - attracted around 70 million 
viewers.

There
 are just 2,500 copies of Photograph for sale. Each one is signed by the
 author and is available from www.RingoPhotoBook.com.
