Former union boss Paul Howes allegedly abused two luxury goods executives after they 'discreetly' told his wife to 'adjust' her dress at a charity function at the Sydney Opera House.

The alleged incident kicked off on the dance floor at The Opera Ball gala fundraiser on Saturday night where Mr Howes was with his Qantas executive wife, Olivia Wirth.

The two women involved, aged in their mid-thirties, claim they approached Ms Wirth to let her know her underwear was showing before Mr Howes, a former head of the Australian Workers' Union, started verbally abusing them.

'My friend had simply gone up to her discreetly, on the side of the dance floor and suggested she might want to adjust her gown which appeared to have either split or come apart... her underwear was showing and it wasn't very flattering,' one of the women told the Sydney Morning Herald. 

'She was trying to do her a favour. The next thing we knew we were being told off by her partner who demanded to know who we were.'

Opera House security guards later called NSW Police after Mr Howes reportedly approached the women outside the venue at the taxi rank.

'Later as we walked to the taxi rank, the same man came up from behind and started being abusive... he grabbed my friend by her dress, suddenly her purse was kicked to the other side of the street and the security guards got involved,' one woman said. 

The women gave statements to police, but a police spokesperson said one of the females later withdrew it and they would no longer be investigating. 

Mr Howes, who would not repeat the alleged insults, admitted to having an argument with the women but denied claims he grabbed the woman's handbag saying 'it kinda just fell'.

'I had a go at her because my wife had been reduced to tears. They had said some truly awful things to her and I wanted to let them know that was very poor behaviour,' he told the Sydney Morning Herald.

Ms Wirth claims the two women were 'drunk and abusive'. 

'It's a really awful experience when people feel the need to insult you in public and your husband has to defend you,' she told the Daily Telegraph.

'It ­ruined what was a lovely evening and we just want to put it behind us.'

The couple, who married in May, were seated on the Qantas table with CEO Alan Joyce.

The two women involved denied being drunk and a witness told the Sydney Morning Herald Mr Howes 'attacked her'.

'It really was not appropriate and she was very, very upset. I made a statement to police but if she doesn't want to pursue it then that is her decision,' he said.
