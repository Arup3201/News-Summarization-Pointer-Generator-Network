A couple who were brought together by their mums' cancer diagnosis, have revealed they tied the knot just days before the bride's mother died.

Kirsty Summers, 27, met her husband, Darren Summers, 34, through a cancer support forum.

As they chatted, they discovered they only lived three miles away from each other in Lincoln and their mothers both suffered from inflammatory breast cancer.

Kirsty and her husband Darren were bought together through a cancer support group and have gone on to have two children together Jack, five and Isabelle, two

As mother's day approaches Kirsty Summers has revealed how hard it will be to spend the day without her mother Carol who died just eight days after her wedding

But while Maureen Summers recovered, Carol Mellars was given just months to live, forcing the couple to bring their wedding forward.

Despite being confined to a wheelchair and on oxygen, she managed to watch her daughter walk down the aisle and whisper: 'You look like a princess.'

She died just eight days later, aged 50. Now Mrs Summers has paid tribute to her mum for finding her 'perfect man'.

The baby sign language teacher said: 'She was so happy the day I got married and I'll always have her to thank for finding my perfect man.

'Mum being diagnosed was the worst thing that happened to me but it ended up leading to the best thing that happened to me.'

The couple have had two children together since their wedding in 2008, Jack, five, and Isabelle, two. On Sunday, Mrs Summers will remember the tragic circumstances she met her husband in.

She said: 'Mother's Day has become easier to cope with now I have the kids and they can make their own little presents.

'That gives things a nicer focus but it's always bittersweet.'

Ms Mellars was first diagnosed with grade-three inflammatory breast cancer in 2007. This meant that the cancer had spread from her breast to her lymph nodes. 

When she was undergoing her first round of gruelling chemotherapy, devastated Mrs Summers joined an online support forum.

'When Darren and I started messaging, the main topic of conversation was always about our mums,' she said. 'But then we got to talking about other things, like hobbies and how much we had in common.

'It just felt like there was a bit of a connection there.' After 10 days of chatting online, the pair arranged to meet at a coffee shop as friends.

She said: 'I was looking forward to the prospect of meeting up with somebody and being able to honestly tell them how I was feeling and know that they were going through the exact same thing.'

When Mr and Mrs Summers' relationship deepened, they introduced their mothers. Soon Ms Mellars and Maureen Summers, 67, also became great friends.

'I think their relationship was similar to mine and Darren's, they found someone they could talk to who knew exactly how they felt,' Mrs Summers said.

In March 2008, six months after the couple met, Mr Summers, a graphic designer, proposed in front of Lincoln cathedral.

The couple had something else to celebrate a month later when both their mothers were given the all clear.

Mrs Summers said: 'We all went out for a meal. We had a lot to look forward to, and it was just brilliant.' But five months later, Ms Mellars developed a cough.

'One day Mum was struggling to breathe so she decided to go to hospital,' her daughter recalled. 'She packed herself a little bag, fed the cat and called herself a taxi.

'Most people would have got themselves an ambulance if they could barely breathe - but that was Mum.'

Doctors ran a full body scan and blood tests which revealed the tragic truth – her cancer had returned.

Mrs Summers said: 'I got a voicemail from Mum asking me and Darren to come round because she wanted to talk to us.

'I just knew. I remember the car journey there - I've never been so hysterical in all of my life.

'We pulled into Mum's street and we hadn't even stopped driving when I jumped out. I just wanted to get to her as soon as I could.

Kirsty continued: 'I banged on the door and when she opened it I fell straight into her arms and was just sobbing my heart out.

'She made us a cup of tea, even though I just wanted to sit down and talk about it - the usual good hostess. I said: 'it's back isn't it?' And she said yes and I started crying.'

Ms Mellars told her daughter that the cancer had spread to her liver, lungs, brain, spleen and eye.

Doctors had given her just months to live. Although Mr and Mrs Summers had planned to get married in May 2010 – two years away - they vowed to bring the wedding forward so Ms Mellars could be there.

'I arranged a whole wedding in four weeks, so she'd be well enough to enjoy it,' Mrs Summers said. 'I imagined her at the reception dancing and still being in quite good health.'

Kirsty says that celebrating mother's day will be made a little bit easier by her two children Jack and Isabelle

But by the time they married in October 2008, Ms Mellars had already deteriorated.

Mrs Summers said: 'She was in a wheelchair and on oxygen. She could barely speak anymore but she had a little notepad for writing down what she wanted to say.

'She managed to whisper to me that I looked like a princess. Half way through the meal, Mum got really tired, so her carers took her home.

'I locked myself in a room and cried in hysterics. I knew that was it. It was literally a countdown until she died because we'd done the thing that she was living for.'

Tragically, Ms Mellars died eight days after the couple married. It also hit Mr Summers' mother hard after they had forged a close friendship.

'My mum became her best friend and so when we lost mum it was a huge loss for her as well,' Mrs Summers explained.

She is now keen to raise awareness of the importance of regular health checks.

'Mum was an extremely healthy person - she didn't smoke, she didn't drink. It just proves that cancer really does pick on anyone,' she said. 'You can't be too careful.

'You have to take every little thing seriously, even if you feel like you're bothering the doctor.'

She misses her mum every day, but Mother's Day is particularly difficult.

'It's just an extra reminder than my children are missing their grandma,' she said. 'There are times I could really do with her advice and her reassurance and Mother's Day highlights that she isn't around.

'I know she would have been so caring with them. Mother's Day will be hard but now I have my own children we can make new memories.'
