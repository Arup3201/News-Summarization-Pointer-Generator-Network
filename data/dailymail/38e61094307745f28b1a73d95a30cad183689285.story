Brothers Zefi, 12, Marsel, 7, and Marsela, 9, do not understand the simple pleasures of an ordinary childhood.

They don't go to school or visit friends, even kicking a football around the garden is out of the question.

Instead the youngsters have spent their entire lives locked inside their home in the Albanian village of Bardhaj, 76 miles north of the capital Tirana, prisoners of a family blood feud which makes it too dangerous for them to venture outside.

The brothers are among an estimated 900 children who must hide indoors to avoid being slaughtered under the ancient Balkan code of practise known as Kanun - which gives a person the right to kill a rival or a rival's relatives in retribution for an earlier killing.

Killings under the Kanun are known as Gjakmarrja or blood-taking, and are similar to the Italian tradition of vendetta.

The practise is said to date back to medieval times although some historians say they can trace its origins to the Bronze age.

Home life: Marsel entertains himself inside his spartan bedroom in the Albanian  village of Bardhaj, 76 miles north of capital Tirana

Tradition: The Kanun is an ancient Balkan code of practise that gives a person the right
 to kill a male member of an offending family in retribution for an earlier killing

It applies to both Christian and Muslim Albanians and regulates
 all aspects ofÂ  life including crime, family, marriage, transfer of 
property, damages as well as personal and social conduct.

It
 was virtually stamped out under Communism but has since returned as 
Albania struggles to emerge as a modern and prosperous democracy, with 
many claiming to hold no faith in the current legal system.

Although
 the blood feud killings are known to date back to the Middle Ages, many
 of the 'rules' have not been adapted to modern times, often they can 
continue until every male member of the families are dead.

Education: In a bid to help trapped children like Zefi, Marsel and 
Marsela Albania's education ministry organises teachers to pay home visits

Bond: The three children hug their hug their teacher who comes twice a week to help them with lessons

Under the rules of Kanun, the killing of women and children and the elderly is technically prohibited, but it is not unknown and most are forced to go into hiding or remain closed in at home.

In a bid to help trapped children like Zefi, Marsel and Marsela Albania's education ministry organises teachers to visit three times a week, for ten hours a week so they can at least receive an education.

Deputy Education Minister Halit Shamata told SETimes: 'We assist by sending in teachers of the school closest to the child's residence.

'In most cases, we prefer teachers who have taught these children before, when they normally attended the lessons. Teaching in these conditions entails difficulties, but teachers try to do the best for these children.'

Longing: Zef, 12, looks out of the window at the forbidden world beyond his own front yard
