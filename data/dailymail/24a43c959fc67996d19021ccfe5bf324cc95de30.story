A shotgun once owned by Wild West sharpshooter Annie Oakley is expected to fetch at least £60,000 at auction.

Oakley was just 25 when she literally shot herself to fame as the top attraction in Buffalo Bill Cody’s travelling Wild West show. She drew huge crowds with her remarkable skills.

Her most famous trick was shooting a playing card facing side-on, then hitting the pieces again as they fell to the floor –from 90ft away.

The 1893 16-gauge Parker hammer shotgun is thought to be Oakley’s first proper gun and came to be one of her favourites.

She used it to wow audiences around the world for 20 years before retiring from the show to take up acting.

During her time on the road she performed for dignitaries including Queen Victoria and Kaiser Wilhelm II.

She was so sure of her talent that for one daring stunt she shot the Kaiser’s cigarette from his mouth.

Following the outbreak of the First World War, she wrote a letter to the Kaiser requesting a second shot but he didn’t reply.

Oakley retired in 1913 and died in Ohio in 1926 aged 66.

Also up for sale is Oakley’s treasured charm bracelet boasting trinkets from her admirers including one from Buffalo Bill.

Experts have tipped both the gun and the charm bracelet to fetch about $97,000 each when they go under the hammer.

They are being sold by Oakley’s great grand niece Bess Edwards, 90, who in 1984 established the Annie Oakley Foundation in her memory.

'Annie Oakley is remembered as an incredibly talented trick shooter who was the star performer with Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show for almost 20 years. Tom Slater, an expert in Americana at auctioneers Heritage, said.

'She was so popular that arguably she made Buffalo Bill’s show famous, not the other way round.

'Annie was skilled with a gun from an early age and was named Little Sure Shot by Native American chief Sitting Bull who also toured with the show.

'She would use all manner of guns in her act but she favored shotguns because their scatter-spray meant it was slightly easier to hit targets.

'She bought this gun in 1883 and there is no evidence of her owning a gun before this one.

'Parker guns were the best you could get and she used this gun throughout her time with the Wild West show.

'In 1887 they went on tour to Europe, and while in Britain a gun specialist watched how she fired and gave her tips on modifications to make to the gun.

'On her return to the US she had the gun restocked to the specifications he suggested.

'Following her death the gun was passed on to her family and has now been consigned by her great grand niece Bess Edwards.

'Bess is now 90 and she has decided it is time to pass these historical items onto someone else.'

The auction will take place in Dallas, Texas, tomorrow.
