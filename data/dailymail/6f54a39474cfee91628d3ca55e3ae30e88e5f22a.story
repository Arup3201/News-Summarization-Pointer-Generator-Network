Mitt Romney has been criticized for being unemotional in the past, but that seems to be behind him as he joined running mate Paul Ryan in welling up with tears during a campaign event in Ryan's home state of Wisconsin on Sunday.

'Tears filled my eyes, tears filled Ann’s eyes. I’m not sure about the kids, but the rest of us felt very emotional,' Romney said after the event in Waukesha, Wisconsin.

The rally was held the day after Ryan was announced as Romney's vice presidential pick. Ryan, the 42-year-old Congressman who still lives in his hometown of Janesville, was undoubtedly the most moved by the strong show of support.

'Hi, Mom!' were his first words.

Tender moment: Romney shows support of running mate Paul Ryan who appeared overwhelmed by the reception he received at a Waukesha, Wisconsin event on Sunday

Native son: Ryan, who has been a Congressman for his district in Wisconsin for 14 years, joked that his large extended family took up half of the 10,000-strong crowd

Moved to tears: Ryan, seen with his wife Janna and their children Charlie, Liza and Sam, had a warm repartee with the crowd

'My veins run with cheese, bratwurst, and a little Spotted Cow and some Miller's,' he said of his Wisconsin roots.

'I like to hunt here, I like to fish here, to snowmobile here. I even think ice fishing is interesting.

'I see my family over there — that’s half the stadium. I have lots of family.'

The crowd seemed just as thrilled as Ryan was, and were more than happy to bring that familial headcount up.

'We are all brothers,' one fan shouted.

Keeping right up with the joke, Ryan replied: 'You're right, we are all brothers. That wasn't my brother who said that, actually.'

Bonding already: Since the announcement of Ryan on the ticket, Romney has seemed energetic

Quite a crowd: Ryan has announced that he will be running for re-election for his congressional seat at the same time as the presidential election because his name is already on the ballot

The Waukesha event which had an estimated 10,000 people in attendance took place the same day as Romney and Ryan appeared in their first sit-down interview since they announced their partnership.

Ryan made his name in Republican circles due to the major cuts he has suggested for the national budget and proposed Medicare overhauls.

While Romney praised Ryan's attempt to 'save Medicare' and called the diligence that Ryan has shown towards budget cuts- which Romney called 'very much needed'- Romney never actually committed to either.

Ryan showed that he was in step with Mitt Romney when it comes to the question of tax returns as he said he will only release two years of tax returns- the same amount that Romney has come under fire for releasing.

The pair appeared relaxed and notably open-collared during their interview with CBS's Bob Schieffer.

When asked how many years of returns he had to present to the Romney camp during their months of secretive talks leading up to his appointment as the vice presidential candidate, Ryan shied away from a clear answer.

Happy together: Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney appeared in their first joint interview which aired on CBS on Sunday night, the day after Ryan was publicly added to the ticket

‘It was a very exhaustive vetting process,’ Ryan said in the interview, adding that it was confidential and therefore he would not be releasing the exact number of years he had to give to the campaign before getting their stamp of approval.

‘I’m going to be releasing two years,’ Ryan confirmed.

Though he put the kibosh on the tax releases, that was not the self-proclaimed policy wonk’s last soundbite on their vision for tax policy.

Only a portion of the interview was aired on 60 Minutes on Sunday.

Policy wonks: Romney praised Ryan's analytical focus and said that they both enjoyed drafting policy

Both Romney and Ryan talked about how
their vision is one that differs greatly from the picture that 
President Obama’s campaign has painted, of how they reportedly plan to 
give tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans while forgetting about the 
less wealthy.

Ryan, who at 42-years-old is the same age as one of Romney's son's, has been yet to be seen wearing a tie since he hit the campaign trail formally on Saturday.

Romney. 65, has followed suit, taking off his tie in subsequent appearances and analysts have viewed the move as an effort to seem more relaxed and comfortable with his younger partner.

In recent months, Romney has been ditching the necktie more often as he has gained ground and become more comfortable campaigning since he was announced as the presumptive Republican nominee.

Ryan said that they plan to ‘take away the tax shelters that are uniquely enjoyed by people in the top tax brackets.’

Some political analysts immediately 
pointed as potentially pointed as it is thought that Romney’s reluctance
to release more years or tax filings comes because he may have used 
such havens to his advantage.

Ryan and Romney appeared at ease with one another during the taped interview that aired on CBS Sunday night and it gave the two men a chance to explain how they envision their relationship should they win come November.

Highlighting Ryan’s policy experience that comes as a result of his 14 years in Congress, Ryan said that they would be sure to capitalize on said knowledge if they win the election.

‘I anticipate that there will be certain areas that he will take a lead role,’ Romney said.

‘He would also have a role in helping shepherd legislation on the Hill. I can’t imagine not using him and to have his skill’ when dealing with Congress.

A complete suit: Internet commentators noted that, during their announcement on Saturday, Ryan wore a jacked with no tie while Romney wore a tie but no jacket

Insider: Romney praised Ryan's prowess in 
Washington, saying that 'There are people that may disagree with Paul 
Ryan, but I don't know of anyone that doesn't respect his character and 
judgement'

‘He has that almost unique capacity to find people of different parties to come together.’

President Obama released a statement 
on the selection of Ryan for the ticket that shows that Democrats will 
likely attempt to portray the Wisconsin congressman as a far-right 
conservative.

'He is a decent man, he is a family 
man, he is an articulate spokesman for Governor Romney's vision but it 
is a vision that I fundamentally disagree with,' he said in the 
statement.

While his congressional record will clearly be scoured over the coming weeks and months, what may become an issue for Ryan is the public perception of Congress in general. Though it has come down from its all-time high of 84 per cent disapproval rating, Congress still faces 76.2 per cent disapproval in the latest polls.

‘It’s the worst I’ve seen since I've been in Congress in the past 14 years,’ Ryan agreed, though he placed the blame on President Obama saying that Congress is ‘dysfunctional’ because of a lack of leadership from above.

‘President Obama is picking winners and losers based on personal connections,’ Ryan said.

‘What I see is a new amount of crony capitalism.’

The latest national polls still have President Obama at 4.6 per cent ahead of the Romney-Ryan ticket.

The pair appears to be on a charm offensive as the younger Ryan- who, at 42-years-old is the same age as one of Romney's son's- seems to have helped bring out the softer side of the Republican presidential nominee.

And according to his wife, that has a lot to do with his easy-going disposition.

'You know, he's pretty low-maintenance. Paul is someone who goes with the flow and has one of the sunniest demeanors and most positive outlooks of anyone I've ever met. So I'd say Mitt'll probably have a lot of fun with him,' Janna Little Ryan told People Magazine.
