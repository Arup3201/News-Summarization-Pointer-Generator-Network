As far as Douglas Pidgeon was concerned, he was only returning his neighbour’s property to its rightful place.

But when he scooped up a deposit left on his lawn by next door’s cat Oscar and hurled it over the garden fence, he cannot have imagined the nightmare it would trigger.

First there was a doorstep confrontation with neighbour Matthew Lucas who claimed there had been more than one missile and pointed out forcefully that one of them had come to rest on his garden table.

Battleground: Mr Pidgeon, who lives at the house on the right, was fed up with the cat belonging to Mr Lucas, who lives on the left, fouling his lawn

Then
 the showdown became physical. Blood was drawn as the two men wrestled 
outside their £250,000 homes in Chippenham, Wiltshire, and ‘clashed 
heads’.

Finally, it ended in court, with Mr Pidgeon, 60, facing a charge of assault. He was cleared after a day-long trial this week.

The father of two told magistrates: ‘The cat comes in and uses the garden as a toilet.

‘I went out to cut the grass and I scooped it up and lobbed it over the fence. I didn’t think anything more about it.

‘I
 know it was their cat. I just threw it – that was it. I didn’t really 
think about it to be honest. I agree the sensible thing to do would have
 been to go and speak to the owners. I have never spoken to them about 
it.’

He admitted throwing 
the poo back over the fence was ‘not the appropriate thing to do’ and 
‘quite irrational’, but added: ‘I didn’t expect anyone to come round at 
all to be honest. I was quite shocked when he did come to my door.’

The
 fight between Mr Pidgeon and Matthew Lucas, 38, was eventually broken 
up by Mr Lucas’s wife Karen, who lodged a complaint with police.

She
 alleged that 5ft 7in Mr Pidgeon had head-butted her 6ft 4in husband. 
But the 60-year-old was cleared of any wrongdoing after magistrates 
failed to agree that the clash of heads was deliberate.

Drama: Chippenham Magistrates court heard how the fight was broken up by Mr Lucas's wfie

The court heard how the dispute escalated on August 5 last year when Mr Lucas returned to his home with his two children.

When
 he opened the patio doors to allow them to play in the garden his 
five-year-old daughter discovered it was littered with cat poo.

Mr
 Lucas cleared up the mess but did not confront his neighbour until his 
wife came home two hours later. Mrs Lucas, 37, said: ‘I came home and my
 husband said my daughter had witnessed what she thought was mud on the 
garden table.

‘He said he 
went out to the garden and looked at it and realised it was cat faeces 
covered in grass, and realised it must have been thrown on to our table.

‘He was not aggressive, he was quite shocked and surprised by the situation.’

She
 said she urged her husband to speak to their neighbour because if their
 daughter ‘had touched this it could have blinded her’. ‘Mr Pidgeon 
admitted it straight away,’ Mrs Lucas told Chippenham magistrates’ 
court. ‘He said, “Yes, I did throw the cat poo over the hedge. I  am fed
 up of the cat coming in my garden”.’

Both
 men claimed to have been ‘speaking normally’ when the confrontation 
began and each blamed one another for starting the fight.

Mr Pidgeon alleged his neighbour prodded him forcefully in the chest before starting to ‘grapple’ with him on the doorstep.

Mr
 Lucas claimed the 60-year-old head-butted him as soon as he raised the 
issue of the cat faeces, causing him to restrain his neighbour through 
fear of another attack.

The court heard they smashed heads, slicing the skin on the bridge of Mr Lucas’s nose and injuring Mr Pidgeon’s forehead.

Magistrates
 cleared Mr Pidgeon of assault by beating after a trial on Monday. Roger
 Coleman, chairman of the bench, said: ‘We find any contact of heads was
 accidental in the course of the struggle that occurred between the 
parties.’

Last night Mrs 
Lucas said the family had not let three-year-old Oscar out since the 
incident. Another neighbour said ‘nearly everyone else in the street’ 
except Mr Pidgeon has cats.
