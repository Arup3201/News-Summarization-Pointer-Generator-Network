Larissa Westcott from Windsor, who says her dreams of being cabin crew with British Airways have been dashed because she has a tattoo on her foot

A student claims she was dismissed from an interview for her dream job as cabin crew with British Airways because she has a small tattoo on her foot.

Larissa Westcott says she was just 20 minutes into the all-day interview at British Airways' headquarters at Heathrow airport when she was told her application wouldn't be taken any further because of the inking on her left foot.

Miss Westcott, of Windsor in Berkshire had always dreamed of a life working at 36,000 feet for the airline.

But once she told interviewers that she had a discreet tattoo of the word 'Aquarius', which is her star sign, her hopes were dashed.

The 20-year-old said: 'I had put on a smart dress, pinned my hair up in a bun, put on heels and applied some red lipstick. I looked the part.

'It was all going well until the woman said, "do you have any tattoos?" I said yes and the woman looked mortified. Straightaway, she dropped her pen and said it was over.

'I wasn't even given a chance. I was humiliated and had to shuffle past all the other candidates on my way out. It was so embarrassing.'

British Airways is currently the subject of a BBC documentary called 'A Very British Airline', which has shown the strict standards the company has when employing cabin crew.

But Miss Westcott, who is a college student while working as an admin clerk, thinks British Airways need to 'get with the times'.

She added: 'If you go to any High Street and picked 10 people at random, I bet eight of them will have a tattoo.

The tattoo, which spells out her star sign Aquarius on her foot, which she believes would have been covered by the tights cabin crew wear as uniform

The 20-year-old, who is a college student and also works as an admin clerk says British Airways 'needs to get with the times'

'Mine is so small and discreet - plus you wouldn't even see it underneath the black tights you have to wear as part of the BA uniform.

'I was really upset because I love BA and I would still fly with them even now. For me, it is the best airline out there - but the way they treated me was ridiculous.

'I feel I would have been an asset for them. I feel BA are losing out on employing good people because their rules are too strict.

A spokesman for British Airways says their uniform policy is clearly stated in the application process

'If passengers can't see the tattoos, then what is the problem?'

However a spokesman for British Airways said: 'We receive thousands of applications to become British Airways cabin crew every year and are proud of the high standards of customer service the successful applicants deliver.

'Our uniform policy is clearly stated during the application process.'
