The older half of the teenage due dubbed Bonnie & Clyde after a multi-state crime spree of stolen vehicles and pilfered checks has been indicted by a grand jury in  Grayson County, Kentucky.

Dalton Hayes, 18, was indicted on 11 charges, including rape in the second degree and violation of custodial interference on Tuesday.

Because his girlfriend is underage, authorities are unable to comment on the charges she could be facing. She is expected to face charges in juvenile court.

Hayes’ bond has been set at $250,000 and he remains behind bars at the Grayson County Detention Center.

He reportedly cried during his arraignment last month when he pleaded not guilty to charges that included statutory rape, custodial interference, criminal mischief, trespassing, theft and burglary.

Hayes' defense lawyer had argued that the teen was not mentally competent to stand trial.

The brazen nature of the alleged crimes and the age of the two teens involved caused national media attention.

Hayes ran away with his 13-year-old girlfriend and allegedly went on a multi-state crime spree before the two were caught in Florida

Hayes and his girlfriend were caught in Panama City Beach, Florida, on January 18.

He was extradited back to Kentucky to stand trial.

The girl was sent back to her father - from whom she ran away.

The girl's mother, Sherry Peters, faces charges of custodial interference after she allegedly picked the girl up from her father's house - even though she has no parental rights.
