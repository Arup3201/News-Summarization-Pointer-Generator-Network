Most people would admit to 'dressing down' when they nip to the shops to buy a quick snack.

But one young woman in Poland took that quite literally and walked into a garage completely naked to buy her lunch.

Customer Cezar Zawadzki, 34, filmed the startling moment on his mobile phone and said he had been filling his car petrol when he saw the young woman  walking towards the garage in Krakow.

A naked young woman walked in to a garage in Poland and waited patiently in the queue to buy her lunch without anyone batting an eyelid

Customer Cezar Zawadzki, 34, took a video on his mobile phone and said he had been filling his car petrol when he saw the young woman completely naked walking towards the garage

She then stopped at the ice-cold drinks cabinet to choose something from inside.

He said: 'I went inside to tell staff but the woman seemed to think I was mad and ignored me, and then I realised she was coming into pay so I grabbed my mobile phone. 

 'She completely ignored me and she didn't seem drunk or on drugs, she just stood patiently waiting in the queue to be served so that she could pay for her drink and a sandwich.

'She  didn't seem drunk or on drugs,' said Mr Zawadzki who was shocked by the display

'The sales assistant served as if nothing was happening, and the blokes in the petrol station be much ignored her, they didn't even sneak a crafty look. It was a really surreal experience,' he said  

'It was pretty hot, I reckon it was well over 30 degrees outside, but what surprised me most was not so much the nudity as the way everybody treated it is perfectly normal.

'The sales assistant served as if nothing was happening, and the blokes in the petrol station be much ignored her, they didn't even sneak a crafty look. It was a really surreal experience. 

'After she paid she just left the shop and back of down the road as if it was the most normal thing in the world.'
