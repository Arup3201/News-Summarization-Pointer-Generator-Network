Javier Hernandez has voiced his disappointment over a lack of playing time at Real Madrid.

The Mexico international, nicknamed Chicharito, joined the European champions last summer on a season-long loan from Manchester United and has made just one Primera Division start.

Real have an option to make the deal permanent at the end of the season but the 26-year-old forward is unlikely to remain at the Bernabeu stadium.

'My situation is frustrating,' Hernandez said in an interview with Fox Sports which will air on Monday evening. 'I cooperate, I help and give my 100 per cent in training but in the games the opportunities are slim.

'I'm in a team but left out of what is important, which are the games.

'At times my confidence is rock bottom although I try for it to be sky high, thanks to the people that are always there with me and support me.'

Hernandez, who joined United from Chivas de Guadalajara in 2010, feels he has delivered for Real when called upon.

He has scored three goals and provided one assist in 13 league appearances for Carlo Ancelotti's side.

'The most important thing is to have opportunities and feel confidence in yourself,' Hernandez said. 'Whenever they (Real) have placed their confidence in me, the numbers have been positive.'

Hernandez opted to leave United last summer after falling down in the pecking order following the arrival of Radamel Falcao to Old Trafford from Monaco.

He is under contract with the Red Devils until June 2016.

Hernandez is currently on international duty with Mexico and he started and scored in Saturday's 1-0 victory over Ecuador in an international friendly in Los Angeles.
