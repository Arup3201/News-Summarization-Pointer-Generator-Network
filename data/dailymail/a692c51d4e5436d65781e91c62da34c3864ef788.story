Gregg's job involves being on call day and night, seven days a week, during the tinderbox summer fire season months in Western US

As one of the 'hotshot crew' - who are highly trained wildfire firefighters - Gregg has found stolen moments during his duties to capture some of the hellish sights he sees.

Working 16-hour days, the grueling role involves containing the fires using strategies to clear away natural fuel for the flames, such as branches, and digging fire lines, which are deep trenches intended to halt the flames.

Gregg used to work on the municipal side of the fire service but was inspired to apply for the hotshot crew after watching a documentary about their work.

Once on the job, he utilized his love of photography to keep friends and loved ones up to date with his work.

Gregg said his job on the frontline is significantly different than the municipal side of things, 'whether it is due to the amount of time you are away from home or the fact you may be sleeping in the dirt for 21 days straight'

Gregg tells VSCO: 'While planning on working in the municipal side of fire, I watched a documentary called 'Fire Wars' that quickly changed my mind, and I started pursuing a position on a hotshot crew with the United States Forest Service.

'To start, I went and camped out in my tent in Oakridge, Oregon, for the summer, while working on a contract crew to gain some experience and start building a resume. 

'The following year, I was offered a position on a hotshot crew in Northern California. The following year, and this past year, I landed a spot on a crew down in the Eastern Sierras.

Gregg said that many people 'are unaware of what goes on out there on a wildfire, and that's what I want to show people'

'While I am taking photos of what the job is like, I am hoping to show people what the wild side of firefighting is like. 

'It is significantly different than the municipal side of things, whether it is due to the amount of time you are away from home or the fact you may be sleeping in the dirt for 21 days straight.
