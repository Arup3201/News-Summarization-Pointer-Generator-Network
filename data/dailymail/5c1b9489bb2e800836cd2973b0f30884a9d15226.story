There isn't a single mention of anyone singing Jerusalem, and it certainly wasn't jam they were making on the kitchen worktop.

So a raunchy tale of two sex-starved sweethearts has aroused the passions of the Women's Institute – after it was published by members.

The 50 Shades Of Grey-style short story appears in a charity book put together by a WI writing group. Yesterday they defended their decision to include the X-rated work in a compilation of poetry and fiction, although one member conceded: 'It's not for the faint hearted.'

But some of the good folk of Wellington – the otherwise perfectly respectable Somerset town where the book is on sale – disagree. 'Really, one does not expect such smut from a group of women involved in the WI,' said Enid Ray. She added: 'I was wholly shocked.'

A WI writing club from Wellington, Somerset have published a book of short stories to raise money for charity. The last tale in the compilation is a steamy three-page piece of erotic fiction (Pictured, left to right from back: Bridget Hodges, Lynda Williamson, Janice Melmoth, Chrissy Barnett, Erica Bond, Chris Tron, Heidi Gains, Sue Bowler and Judith Smith who form part of the Wellington WI writing club)

The door creaked and in Clive walked. He looked amazing to behold with his mound of auburn curls and his newly grown designer stubble. He gave her a cheeky wink and a teasing tap to her rump. Mariah turned and gave him a massive full bodied hug. Her man was home. She kissed him temptingly and gave him her most longing and yet innocent of looks.

'I can tell you missed me Mariah. Been quite a while... and I am a man in desperate, aching need...'

Clive knew she was teasing him. He put his arms around her waist from behind and gently gyrated his massive schlong against her lovely wide buttocks

'Come on... drop your drawers, Princess! This man is lusty!' Clive was masterful in his demand.

The tempo of their passion escalated. He couldn't wait for his 'oats' any longer. HIs girl was certainly a naughty one!

'Do you think it's worked this time?' Mariah quizzed pleadingly. He had in his lust forgotten all about their efforts to conceive. 'Who knows, Princess? You never know! Now be a good woman and make us a cuppa. That exertion has totally knackered me out!' Clive then gave her buttocks a loving, playful tap and went and turned the TV on.

They would forever remember this moment in time. It would later prove to be a life-changing segment in their story. Time showed that this Adonis with his Goddess had finally conquered the game that is conception

Stacy Faulkner, 50, who sells the book from her shop, Nurtured by Nature, in the town, said a local WI woman came in and told her: 'I don't know if you want to sell this because the last chapter is a bit raunchy'. She added: 'I've been reading the book – I read the last chapter first! I can see why some of the older ladies are kicking up a fuss. But it's just a bit of fun.'

The story, The Conquering Gibraltarian Adonis features a couple called Mariah and Clive, reunited when he returns from a long spell at sea with tumbling auburn curls and newly-grown designer stubble.

The pair are married, it transpires, and – praise the Lord – intent on starting a family. At least that fits in with a WI ethos that has held firm since the organisation's inception in 1915. Yet Clive has barely crossed the threshold before it's straight down to business.

To be fair, the story is just three pages long so there's precious little space to waste on plot development. But what follows might make even 50 Shades author EL James blush. Much of it is unsuitable for repetition. Suffice to say that heaving thighs and 'magnificent cleavage' feature among the less controversial prose. Things hot up as soon as Clive announces: 'I am a man in desperate, aching need.'

The story continues: 'She was trying to play hard to get. That was becoming difficult as she really wanted it right now on top of the kitchen counter.'

It continues: 'Mariah giggled in that mischievous way he loved, whilst playfully taunting him with those eyes.

'She feigned interest and bent over the worktop to reach the tin of tea bags. Clive put his hands around her waist from behind…'

Heavens to Betsy! In a WI book? Surely not? 

The short story, written by a WI member for a charity book they have released, is called The Conquering Gibraltarian Adonis

But yes, yes… yes! Clive – 'masterful in his demand' – skips the romance by commanding: 'Drop your drawers, Princess – this man is lusty!' Their lovemaking causes 'sudden waves of pleasure' to pulse through Mariah's entire body. But then it's back to normal. 'Make us a cuppa,' says Clive, and moves away to turn on the TV.

The story comes with an 18-plus rating for readers and warns: 'Read no further if you are of a delicate disposition or think you may be offended by the contents of what follows.' Some are clearly not, however. The book, with an innocuous cover featuring butterflies and flowers in the artwork, was disappearing from local shops yesterday and 150 have already been sold.

The compilation authors are members of the Monumental Women's Writing Group, which takes its name from the town's monument.

 The 75-page book called Once Upon A Time Wellington WI is being sold for £4

Their Facebook page at www.facebook.com/monumentalwomensink contains details of the work below a photograph of some of the Wellington team. The £4 book, Monumental Women's Ink: Once Upon A Time Wellington WI, is being sold to raise money for nearby Musgrove Park Hospital's Beacon centre for cancer treatment.

Group leader Bridget Hodges, a 63-year-old retired writer, said: 'When 50 Shades came out, we talked about it quite a bit. We decided that we would have a go and try to write some ourselves.

'In the end, only one of our members managed to produce a piece.' When the book was compiled, the story was included.

Unlike EL James, however, the author remains anonymous. 'She doesn't want anyone to know it was her,' Mrs Hodges explained. 'She said her gran would be furious.'
