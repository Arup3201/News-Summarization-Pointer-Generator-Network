'We are working with the Australian Human Rights Commission to identify ways we can support working parents,' the report says.

'In 2013–14, we attended their national roundtable and contributed data to their national review into the prevalence, nature and consequences of discrimination in relation to pregnancy at work and return to work after parental leave.'

Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James said that failing to respect the rights of pregnant employees is a serious matter.

'It is the responsibility of employers to make sure they are aware of their obligations under workplace laws and that they treat workers fairly,' Ms James said.

'We want to increase awareness that discriminating against pregnant women is a serious breach of workplace laws and won't be tolerated.'

Sex Discrimination Commissioner Elizabeth Broderick told Daily Telegraph that she was not surprised with the figures, adding she also found half of working mothers experience discrimination in her surveys.

'I met women who were asked to make a choice - the job or the baby,' she told Daily Telegraph.

'The underlying implication was if you want to keep your job you need to terminate your pregnancy. And I met women who hard terminated their pregnancy as result of that.'

The next most common discrimination complaints in the workplace were disability with 20 percent, followed by family and carer's responsibilities at 10 percent.

Under the Fair Work Act, it is unlawful to discriminate against employees on the grounds of pregnancy, race, colour, sex, sexual preference, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family or carer responsibilities, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin.

Discriminatory behaviour can include dismissing an employee, threatening to dismiss an employee, reducing an employee's hours, denying training and promotion opportunities or refusing to employ, promote or train an employee.

The penalties imposed in the case also relate to contraventions of workplace laws relating to keeping employment records, complying with a Notice to Produce records and obtaining written agreements for part-time employees.
