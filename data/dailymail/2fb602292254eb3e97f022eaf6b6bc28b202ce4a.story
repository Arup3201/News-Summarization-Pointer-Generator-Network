A 17-year-old high school baseball star has been charged with murder after beating his mother with a bat then viciously hacking her to death on Christmas Eve, police say.

Police found Sharon Hill Aydelott in a pool of blood at her home in Gulf Breeze, Florida, with her throat slashed and a large kitchen knife sticking out of her eye socket about 6pm Tuesday.

Her son, William Brandon Aydelott, a promising pitcher on the Gulf Breeze High School baseball team, was arrested and confessed to killing her after a heated argument, authorities say.
