Chicago Bears star Chris Conte has said that he believes playing in the NFL is worth any risk to his long-term health

Chicago Bears star Chris Conte, who has suffered two concussions this season, has said that he believes playing in the NFL is worth any risk to his long-term health.

The 25-year-old defensive back told WBBM that he is happy to accept a shorter life span in return for living out his dream of playing professional football.

'I'd rather have the experience of playing and, who knows, die 10, 15 years earlier than not be able to play in the NFL and live a long life,' said Conte.

The player has experienced his fair share of injury issues this season, causing him to miss three games and leaving him unable to continue in seven of the 12 games he's been involved in.

'Ever since I was a little kid, it's what I've wanted to do,' Conte told WBBM.

'In college, I didn't even graduate school because my senior year, I honestly let school be a casualty to that because I knew I had one opportunity to make it to the NFL, and I put everything into that. And I felt school's something I could figure out later.

'As far as after football, who knows. My life will revolve around football to some point, but I'd rather have the experience of playing and, who knows, die 10, 15 years earlier than not be able to play in the NFL and live a long life. 

'It's something I've wanted to do with my life and I wanted to accomplish. And I pretty much set my whole life up to accomplish that goal. So I don't really look toward my life after football because I'll figure things out when I get there and see how I am.

'As long as I outlive my parents, then we'll be all right,' Conte said.

When questioned later about his comments, Conte reiterated that he believed 'doing what I love outweighs risks despite injuries I have amounted this year.'

'My reference wasn't even to concussions, just the associated risk with football and accepting the fact that life expectancy of someone who has played in the NFL is shorter than the average person,' he told ESPN on Wednesday.

'And I'm fine with trading that risk for the opportunity to play football since it's something I have always wanted to do and a dream come true.

Former Bears tight end Desmond Clark tweeted soon after that he agreed with Conte. 

'So I live to 75 instead of 85 and in return I had the chance to play in the NFL. I'll do it all over again,' Clark tweeted.

The NFL expects 6,000 of nearly 20,000 retired players — or 28 percent — to suffer from Alzheimer's disease or at least moderate dementia someday.  

But other former players have sued the league over injuries they say are the result of playing football.

The NFL last month urged a judge to approve an estimated $1 billion settlement of concussion lawsuits despite concerns raised by former players or survivors who felt left out. 

The 65-year fund would resolve thousands of lawsuits that accuse the NFL of long hiding what it knew about concussions and brain injuries to keep players on the field.
