Yesterday  SpaceX’s Dragon capsule returned to Earth in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Baja California.

The unmanned vehicle was returning from the ISS, carrying with it about 4,000lbs (1,800kg) of cargo including science experiments and equipment.

And, in a stunning image, the capsule was spotted above Earth before it made its way back through the atmosphere.

This amazing image shows the moments after the Dragon capsule was released from the ISS before returning to Earth early yesterday morning.  The SpaceX  spacecraft was detached from the ISS on 10 Feb by Expedition 42 crewmembers Samantha Cristoforetti of Esa and Terry Virts of Nasa using the robotic arm on the station

The image, taken at 0044 GMT (1944 EST)shows the Dragon capsule flying free above a coastline, with its solar panels extended and its service module still attached.

When the spacecraft begins to enter the atmosphere, both the panels and the service module are jettisoned.

This is because they cannot survive the temperatures of re-entry, while the top capsule can - it is designed to bring cargo back from the ISS to Earth.

Ultimately, a modified version of Dragon will begin taking astronauts to and from the ISS, possibly as early as 2017.

Dragon splashed down about 260 miles (420km) southwest of Long Beach, California after a journey of about five and a half hours from the ISS.

Its return overlapped with the company’s Falcon 9 launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, which took place last night.

This latest Dragon mission was SpaceX’s fifth scheduled cargo mission to the ISS under contract with Nasa, and the seventh flight overall of the Dragon spacecraft. 

The mission launched on 10 January 2015 atop a Falcon 9 rocket and arrived at the ISS on 12 January.

It brought with it more than 5,100lbs (2,300kg) or cargo, including provisions for the crew, science equipment and something called the Cloud Aerosol Transport System (Cats) - which will measure pollution in Earth’s atmosphere. 

The image of Dragon was taken above the coast line of Salalah in Oman, shown above, David MacLean of Centre of Geographic Sciences told MailOnline

The Dragon capsule is one of only two unmanned spacecraft that can return cargo from the ISS to Earth, the other being Russia's Progress vehicle. Parachutes are used to help the Dragon touch down in the Pacific Ocean, shown in these images

After landing the Dragon capsule was successfully taken on board a vessel, shown in this image. The cargo will now be inspected to ensure everything returned to Earth in working order

DSCOVR (pronounced discover) is designed to provide advance warnings of solar outbursts that could disrupt life here on Earth.

It will spend nearly four months traveling one million miles (1.6 million km), four times farther than the moon, to the so-called Lagrange point, a gravity-neutral position in direct line with the sun.

At this lookout location, 92 million miles (148 million km) from the sun, it will provide advance warnings of incoming geomagnetic storms that could disrupt power and communications on Earth.

The steady stream of Earth pictures, meanwhile, is expected to be high on the 'wow' factor.

The observatory's camera will provide the first snapshots of the entire home planet, its full face lit by the sun, since Nasa's final Apollo moon-landing in 1972. Subsequent Earth views have been stitched together from multiple images.

The launch of this mission also saw SpaceX attempt, for the first time, to land the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket on a floating barge.

The attempt was partially successful, with the rocket crash landing after running out of fuel - but almost hitting its target perfectly.

A second attempt was to be made on the launch of the Falcon 9 rocket yesterday on what was a busy day for SpaceX, but the landing had to be aborted after the barge was battered by high winds and waves.

Instead, the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket performed a successful precision landing in the ocean to further refine the technology - although, of course, with no barge the rocket was left to sink into the sea.

The next attempt will not be until April, which will be the next Falcon 9 rocket that will be fitted with the landing legs necessary to make a landing attempt. 

The launch, however, passed without a hitch. The unmanned Falcon 9 rocket blasted off at 1103 GMT from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida in perfect weather conditions.

It carried with it Noaa's £220 million ($340 million) Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR), the first deep-space mission for SpaceX.

DSCOVR replaces a 17-year-old satellite monitoring for potentially dangerous solar storms, which can disrupt GPS signals, block radio communications and impact power grids on Earth.

It will take DSCOVR 110 days to reach its operational orbit around the sun, where it will serve as a weather buoy, providing about an hour's advance notice of threatening solar activity.

DSCOVR also has two sensors to monitor Earth to track volcanic plumes, measure ozone and monitor droughts, flooding and fires.
