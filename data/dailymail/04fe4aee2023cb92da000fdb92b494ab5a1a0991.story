He has been in and out of jail, was arrested for selling cocaine and has been known to carry a gun.

But it seems Snoop Dogg, who was once renowned as one of the most dangerous rappers in the world, has become accepted by America's political elite.

He met the US Secretary of State, during the function hosted by the Obama Administration to celebrate the 2013 Kennedy Centre Honorees in early December.

The pair had a brief conversation before Kerry opted against a traditional hand shake and went for something a bit more 'gangsta'.

The rapper then uploaded a video of the encounter on Instagram and posted it on Twitter, saying: 'Boss life. me n john kerry at d white house !!! #reincarnated #khc.'

It is not the first time the fist-bump has been used by member of the Obama administration.

Kerry was photographed giving the gesture to the former US Ambassador to Italy, David Thorne.

President Obama has also been spotted greeting White House employees, guests and even his wife with the fist pound, which is a symbol of giving respect.

The first documented fist bump occurred among ancient Greek charioteers as a friendly greeting after finishing a race and became popular with biker gangs which travelled around America in the 1940's.

Respect: The greeting is also popular with President Barack Obama
