A Georgia man who accidentally lit his wife ablaze is now trying to douse a legal inferno.

Authorities are set to charge Austin Dawkins, 37, with reckless endangerment after he started a fire last month that badly burned his wife while flicking a lighter next to his gas tank.

Security footage shows the pair talking while pumping gas at a Clarkesville gas station Oct 16 when flames burn Jessica Dawkins, 30.

Not a good idea: Austin Dawkins lit his wife on fire after flicking a cigarette lighter next to his gas tank

Reckless: The fire consumed the back half of the truck - no word on whether it survived the blaze

A warrant has been issued for Mr Dawkins’ arrest, according to a statement from state fire safety commissioner Ralph Hudgens, which was first reported by CNN.

The inferno caused second and third-degree burns on Ms Dawkins’ legs, arms, back and head, the statement said, adding that Mr Dawkins also injured his hand.

Video shows Ms Dawkins walking up to her husband as he pumps gas. The amateur pyro then shows her a lighter before flicking It next to the gas tank.

This immediately sparks a fire, badly burning Ms Dawkins as she runs away.

Mr Dawkins is then seen running away as the back half of the truck is soon on fire while parked next to the gas tank.

If convicted, the fire starter faces up to one year in prison and a $1,000 fine.

There was no word on the condition of the truck.
