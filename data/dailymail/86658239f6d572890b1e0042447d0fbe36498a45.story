Stuart Pearce is entering what could well be the final weeks of his managerial career.

After six weeks of sustained defeats, the boardroom tittering at Nottingham Forest is becoming more pronounced and a decision whether to cut short their relationship is drawing near.

Pearce watched his side lose their fourth game on the bounce when the well-organised, albeit limited, Sheffield Wednesday scored twice in five minutes to stretch their hosts’ winless run to eight.

That includes an FA Cup humbling at Rochdale last week, as well as an alarming zero points from two games against Birmingham City. They have won just twice since September 17.

Talk is growing louder that owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi is growing restless.  

It is a sorry state of affairs for a man whose popularity at the City Ground should not wane because of a gamble that has not paid off.

For Pearce, Forest represents his last chance at building a career as a No 1. There would be no coming back if he were to be potted so soon in surroundings he should thrive in.

‘In myself, yes,’ Pearce said when asked if he believed he would still be in charge next week. ‘I don’t make that judgment call but the one thing this football club needs is togetherness. 

'Any manager would be disappointed not to be given the time they need to finish a job, but if you’re asking me whether I’m very disappointed at this moment in time, yes, I am.

‘All eyes are on me, whether it’s the media, the boardroom, the players, the supporters. I have to be rock solid and I can tell you I won’t be buckling, and the players have to take strength from me.’

Pearce is idolised for playing glories - he spent 12 emotional years at the club - and that, quite rightly, will never change. But regardless of the past, those who control Forest need to stick or twist - and let their fanbase know why.

It is not as if they haven’t been supportive. Yes, there were issues surrounding the sales and subsequent loans of Karl Darlow and Jamaal Lascelles to Newcastle United, but Pearce was given in the region of £9million in the summer.

Half of that was spent on Peterborough striker Britt Assombalonga; the idea was that this was an appointment for the long haul. Unfortunately such grand gestures cannot legislate for the results they are enduring.

Something has to give, but nobody around the club is wholly sure what. Pearce points towards a lengthy injury list as reason why they have fallen 10 points behind the play-offs, while others suggest his tactics and inability to get the best of out of his substitutions. As ever, the truth lies somewhere in between.

The supporters are now split. They are all willing the 52-year-old to do well and some assert that six months simply isn’t long enough to garner which direction this will eventually head. 

Others do not afford Pearce that sentiment. After waiting the best part of three years to at least show signs of competing at this level, the facts remain that results are not good enough and performances are lethargic.

And any discussions as to whether Forest should part ways with a sixth permanent manager in three seasons will doubtless take into consideration mistakes of the past, including Steve McClaren’s farcical three-month reign.

They are a club craving stability, but at what point do you draw the line and cut your losses?

Pursuing a strong figurehead who assimilates what the club stands for is laudable - Forest clearly went into this with the best of intentions - but they’ve picked the wrong man. 

Next up for Forest is a trip to promotion-chasing Derby, a fixture former manager Billy Davies (above) was sacked after on the back of a 5-0 thumping back in March

Sean O’Driscoll, Billy Davies and now Pearce might have appeared the right fits at the time but football has moved on without them.

It should not be overlooked that Pearce hadn’t been in club management for seven years prior to his homecoming and it’s showed.

Sportsmail reported last week that Al-Hasawi took the unusual step of seeking counsel from first- team players over the former England international’s management style.

‘We are trying to imitate Manchester City at a lower level,’ the owner said last month. 

He was at the game on Saturday and may have to revise that statement following an afternoon where Forest managed just three shots on target.

The word crisis is one banded about far too easily - they are nowhere near that state at present - although those at the top are twitching.

What lies ahead at the iPro Stadium on Saturday should bring matters to a head. 

Davies was sacked after losing 5-0 against Derby back in March; the same fate may befall his successor if another east Midlands embarrassment is dished up by McClaren and co. In a way, it’d be somewhat fitting.

Good week for... CREWE

Now out of the League One relegation zone, Crewe are on a four-match unbeaten run for the first time since the backend of last season. They have also managed to renew the loans of Nicky Ajose, Alan Tate and Jamie Ness until the end of the campaign.

Bad week for... CHARLTON

Another defeat - this time at the hands of Chris Hughton’s Brighton - meant the Addicks called time on Bob Peeters’ tenure as manager. Hardly surprising, really, given they’ve got steadily worse throughout the season. Peeters might’ve even taken them down.

TALENT SCOUT: Joe Bryan (Bristol City)

Might have come to the attention this weekend because of his opening goal in the 4-0 win against Notts County, but Bryan has been a steady performer at wing-back for the Robins and helped Steve Cotterill’s side become the meanest defence in League One.
