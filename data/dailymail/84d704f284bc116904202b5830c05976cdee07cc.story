Comedian Bill Cosby took to the stage on Saturday night despite drawing a 100-strong crowd of protesters who chanted 'Rape is not a joke!' and 'No means no!' outside the theater.

Remaining defiant amid a storm of sexual assault allegations against him, the 77-year-old entertainer carried out two performances at the Buell Theater in Denver, Colorado.

During his first show, he was welcomed to the stage with a standing ovation and hoots of 'We love you Bill!'. He did not make any reference to the allegations throughout the two-hour performance.

Meanwhile, dozens of demonstrators, led by lawyer Gloria Allred - who is representing at least seven of the women to have accused Cosby of assault - waved signs and chanted outside the venue.

Angry: Among the signs were the slogans: 'Colorado believes the women', 'What if it was your daughter?', 'If you support Cosby you support rape' (left) and 'Believe victims, rapists lie'. Ms Allred is pictured center

Earlier in the day, a woman had held a news conference, alongside Ms Allred, at a nearby hotel to accuse Cosby of sexually assaulting her in 1986.

During the conference, a teary-eyed Beth Ferrier, 55, claimed that the entertainer put drugs in her coffee when she went to see one of his shows in Denver.

'I cannot tell you how horrific of a feeling that is,' she said, adding that the next thing she remembered was waking up hours later in the back of her car 'practically naked'.

Ms Ferrier has said previously she was assaulted by Cosby. She went public in June 2005, alleging that as a model visiting New York in the early 1980s, she met Cosby and they had a brief affair.

Cosby is facing sexual assault accusations from at least 15 women, with some of the claims dating back decades. He has denied the allegations through his attorney and has never been charged.

Speaking outside the Buell Theater on Saturday night, longtime Cosby fan Robert Belveal, 48, of Denver, told the Associated Press the protesters outside did nothing to deter him from attending.

'I believe that if you're not convicted of a crime, then why should you be judged?' he said. 'All it takes is for one person to say something, then you have all these other people wanting to get their 15 minutes of fame.'

On Friday, Cosby performed at a packed show in Pueblo. About 25 chanting protesters gathered outside the venue. But inside, the crowd warmly welcomed the comedian to the stage.

Making his first appearance in Pueblo since a 1996 show at the Colorado State Fair, Cosby was embraced by a mostly middle-aged and older crowd.

On Thursday, the star released a statement saying that he felt ready to perform in Colorado.

'I have thousands of loyal, patient and courageous fans that are going to leave their homes to enjoy an evening of laughter and return home feeling wonderful,' he said. 'I'm ready!'

Cosby finished his statement with references to his 'Fat Albert' character's trademark line and to his 2013 television special - 'Hey, Hey, Hey - I'm Far From Finished.'

Cosby's persistence comes after protesters interrupted a handful of his recent shows.

Hecklers stood up and chanted repeatedly 'we believe the women' at Cosby's third and final performance of a Canadian tour on January 9.

The protesters then marched out of the theater as Cosby asked his audience not to react. The day before, a man at Cosby's performance in London, Ontario, called the comedian a rapist. 

The shows in Canada were the comedian's first since November when a string of performances were canceled over the accusations.

More recently, a model who claims Cosby drugged and sexually abused her at the Playboy Mansion in 2008 met with Los Angeles police on Wednesday to pursue criminal charges.

Chloe Goins' attorney said that his client is the first woman accusing Cosby of sexual misconduct whose case may fall within the statute of limitations.

On Friday, Cosby's attorney, Martin  Singer, said  the star was in New York the night Goins claims she was accosted.

It comes as NBC's top entertainment executive has said the door is firmly shut to Cosby's return to the network. Thirty years ago, Cosby was the sitcom king with NBC's 'The Cosby Show'.

But on Friday, the network's Entertainment Chairman, Bob Greenblatt, said: 'That's safe to say' when asked if NBC would ever again do a project with the comedian.

Speaking with the Television Critics Association, Mr Greenblatt went on to explain: 'Fifteen women came out and accused him of what they accused him of. When that many people come out and have such similar complaints, it became a tainted situation.' 

The network said late last year it was dropping plans to develop a 'classic' family sitcom with Cosby.

The comedian is scheduled to continue his tour in Turlock, California, on Sunday.

A statement from Cosby's publicist was not immediately available on Saturday night.
