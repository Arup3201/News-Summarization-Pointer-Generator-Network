This is the first picture of the man who shot his ‘childhood sweetheart’ leaving her in a critical condition hours after the family returned from a Boxing Day shooting trip.

Paul White, 37, attacked partner Shani Cockrell, 33, after he allegedly flew into a drunken rage while their two young boys, aged two and four, were in a nearby room.

The bricklayer was found dead by police in the couple’s bedroom in the early hours of yesterday morning after he turned the gun on himself.

Miss Cockrell was rushed to hospital where she was in a critical but stable condition.

Earlier in the day, Miss Cockerill's 
sister, Jez, posted photos of relatives at a Boxing Day shoot wearing 
camouflage gear, including a child holding a toy gun.

Their terrified sons were discovered by police cowering in a bedroom at the family’s terraced home in Bircotes, Nottinghamshire.

It is not known if they witnessed the shootings and are now believed to be staying with Miss Cockrell’s sister.

The couple, who had been together since they were teenagers, were yesterday described by shocked friends as a ‘happy couple’ who ‘hardly argued’.

One neighbour, who didn’t want to be 
named, said he saw them ‘happily’ walking home with a group of friends 
from a nearby pub just an hour before the incident. He said they were 
‘really not the argumentative type’.

‘It’s a massive shock,’ he added. ‘They were a lovely couple, I have no idea what’s behind it.’

However, neighbour Karen Taylor, 40, 
said she had seen the ‘usually very quiet’ Mr White walk home from the 
same pub earlier in the afternoon on Boxing Day looking drunk and 
‘wobbly’.

A police spokesman confirmed yesterday that the road worker and Manchester United fan was a licensed shotgun holder.

A Land Rover, which was parked outside the house yesterday, had a British Association for Shooting sticker in the back window.

As a keen game shooter he reportedly had several guns, and regularly enjoyed shooting trips with Miss Cockrell’s father Gerald, known as Gez.

Friend Tiffany Carmichael, 25, who works in the local fish and chip shop, said the couple were ‘childhood sweethearts’.

‘They’d been going out since school and been together all their adult lives,’ she said.

‘They aren’t known as a couple who row a lot. He was licensed to have a gun. He would often go hunting with Shani’s dad, and I’m told they’d been out shooting quite recently. She is a lovely, lovely lass.’

Miss Cockrell, who drives a Range Rover and works as a mobile hairdresser, a business she is believed to run with her mother, was described by friends as ‘bubbly’.

Another neighbour added: ‘This is going to devastate the whole community. The people are very close here. It is an old mining community. When you need people they are there for you.’

Mr Cockrell and his wife Julie, live in a house directly opposite the scene of the tragedy.

There was no answer at the property yesterday, and it is thought the couple were at their daughter’s bedside.

Mr Cockrell was a former miner who was forced to give up work after he lost an eye in a pit accident. Miss Cockrell’s uncle said last night: ‘It’s very tragic and terrible for the children. We are a close-knit family and this is going to hit us hard.

‘Shani and Paul seemed like a great couple. They were devoted to their kids so something awful must have happened for this to happen, but I have no idea what.

‘Paul was very into shooting in the countryside and it was well known he had a gun.’

A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police yesterday confirmed they had found a man’s body at the property. He said the children were unharmed and ‘safely removed’.

A cordon remained in place at the scene last night while the investigation continued.
