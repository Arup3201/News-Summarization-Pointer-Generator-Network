Five vicious robbers brutally beat a 20-year-old student who was rushing home in gale-force winds as Superstorm Sandy savaged New York. 

The thugs made off with Jeremy Furchtgott’s iPhone and $40 – but not before one of them ground the Yeshiva student’s face into the sidewalk and threatened to kill him.

Surveillance video captured the entire shocking assault in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn and nearby trees can be seen whipping violently in strong winds.

Brutal attack: Jeremy Furchtgott sustained a concussion and was knocked unconscious by the violent attack he sustained

Mr Furchtgott, a Princeton University graduate, was trying to make it home in his darkened city about 6.45pm on Monday before the worst of the storm hit, the New York Daily News reports. 

Suddenly, he was tripped by one of the thugs. 

Mr Furchtgott said he didn’t even realize what was happening until it was too late. He thought he tripped over a branch, at first.

Then, face-down on the ground, the robbers pummeled him with their fists and kicked him.

‘Give me your phone! Give me your wallet,’ one of the men told him.

They made him empty his pockets and give them everything he had. 

He handed over his iPhone and his wallet with $40.

Threat: The video shows four of the robbers casually walking away as a fifth lingers. He puts his foot on Mr Furchtgott's head, pushing his face into the sidewalk, and says: 'Stay down! Don't look up until you count to 100 or I'll shoot you!'

The blurry video shows four of the robbers casually walk away, but a fifth lingers a moment.

He put his foot on Mr Furchtgott’s head, pushing his face into the sidewalk, and delivered a threat.

‘Stay down! Don’t look up until you count to 100 or I’ll shoot you!’

The video shows the young man laying motionless for about 30 seconds. He wavered in and out of consciousness as he counted – obeying the instructions of his attacker. 

Sruly Halon, who was himself trying to make it home before the weather turned truly nasty, discovered Mr Furchtgott facedown on the sidewalk.

'Shocking' robbery: Police could not find the thugs responsible for the attack which has horrified the tight-knit Jewish community in Crown Heights

He never suspected that heartless robbers had left the young man that way.

‘At first I didn’t know why he was lying there. I wasn’t sure if something happened to him physically. Maybe a tree hit him,’ Mr Halon told the Daily News.

Mr Furchtgott was so dazed after struggling to his feet, he remembered being robbed, but could not recall being beaten. 

The NYPD showed up and scoured the neighborhood, but could not find the thugs. 

The attack horrified the tight-knit Jewish community in Crown Heights. 

City Councilman David Greenfield called the robbery ‘shocking’ and offered a $1,000 reward for the arrest of the hooligans.

Now watch the CCTV of the attack
