Wesleyan University says at least 11 students have been hospitalized with symptoms of overdoses on the drug known as 'Molly.'

Dean Michael Whaley, vice president of student affairs, said in a letter to the campus that one of the students, a sophomore, was in critical condition at Middlesex Hospital on Sunday.

The university says it's aware of 11 students being treated for overdose symptoms consistent with the use of Molly, a stimulant psychoactive drug also known as methylone, MDMA or a handful of other substances akin to ecstasy.

Overdoses: Wesleyan University says at least 11 students have been hospitalized with symptoms of overdoses on the drug known as 'Molly'

According to FoxCT, seven of the students were sent to the hospital via ambulance and four went to hospitals on their own.

No other information about their conditions was released.

Whaley said Middletown police, university police and residence officials are investigating. 

The school's administration asked students on Sunday to check on their friends and make sure they aren't in danger.

'I ask that you keep these students in your thoughts and share my hope that they will fully recover,' Whaley said. 

Middletown and university police declined immediate comment. 

Molly is the street name for drugs  pushed as a pure form of ecstasy.

In the last five years, Molly has made its way into popular culture, helped by references to it made by entertainers such as Madonna, Miley Cyrus and Kanye West.

The drug's dangers became more clear after a rash of overdoses in recent years.

The parties of the late 1980s and early '90s saw the heyday of ecstasy, but its popularity began to wane a decade ago after a number of deaths and hospitalizations.

That's when Molly made her way onto the scene.

Over the last few years, drugs sold under that name have 'flooded' the market, said Rusty Payne, a spokesman with the Drug Enforcement Administration.

In some states, there has been a 100-fold increase - the combined number of arrests, seizures, emergency room mentions and overdoses - between 2009 and 2012, according to DEA figures.

The drug is accessible and marketed to recreational drug users who believe it to be less dangerous than its predecessor, which was often cut with other substances, from Ritalin to LSD.

Like ecstasy, Molly is said to give a lengthy, euphoric high with slight hallucinogenic properties.

In reality, however, the promised pure MDMA experience 'doesn't exist,' said Payne.
