Trying - and failing - to fit into a size 20 wedding dress was the wake-up call needed for an overweight mother-of-two.

As 18st Lindsey Jones struggled into the too-tight bridal gown she had to accept she'd ballooned to a size 22. Bursting into ashamed tears, she made a vow to herself to lose weight before marrying her partner Sid.

So the beauty therapist from Worcestershire joined a local Zumba class where dancing to sexy salsa, samba and reggaeton tunes helped her to lose a staggering 6st - and also helped her to find a fulfilling new career as a dance instructor.

The mother-of-two from Bewdley, Worcestershire, would regularly snack on biscuits, cakes and crisps throughout the day, as well tucking into unhealthy takeaways every night and not eating a vegetable for weeks.

She cried when she stood on the scales and tried to squeeze herself into a size 20 in a bid to deny her real dress size.

But Lindsey decided to fight the flab and that evening signed up for a Zumba class.

She had lost 2st in time for her wedding three months later and through committed twerking and salsa-ing she lost another 4st after her big day.

She has since trained as a Zumba instructor and has given up her career as a successful beauty therapist to lead five classes a week helping other women twerk away their tummies.

Lindsey’s transformation has been so remarkable that last month she was invited to meet the creator of Zumba, Beto Perez.

Lindsey said: 'It was getting to the point where a size 20 was too tight and I couldn’t bring myself to look at my real weight. I just cried standing on the scales.

'Cream cakes were my favourite things and I was sat eating one at work when I realised I couldn’t carry on like this anymore and I couldn’t get married at 18st.

In the run up to her wedding, Lindsey became determined to drop her excess weight and began Zumba classes

'I didn’t like working out or going to the gym but when I turned up to my first Zumba class it was completely different.

'It was like a party. Nobody cared what you looked like or what you were wearing and I just danced away the weight.

'We shimmy and get low with our hips to all sorts of music - salsa, reggaeton and samba. There are elements of merengue, cumbia, samba, belly dance, bhangra and hip-hop.

'The moves go with the music and the rhythms from all over the world and it’s been a great way to lose weight.'
