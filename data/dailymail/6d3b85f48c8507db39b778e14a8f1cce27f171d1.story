Oops: Chrissie Ann Solis, 35, of Murfreesboro called the cops to report her friend had stolen $140 from her. Police say she'd actually given the friend the money to get her drugs and figured it out from text messages that allegedly showed Solis asking for seven Lortabs at $20 per pill...or $140 worth

A Tennessee woman's plan to have her drug dealer arrested appears to have backfired after police say they found text messages that prove she was looking to score some pain pills.

Chrissie Ann Solis, 35, of Murfreesboro told police a friend came over and stole $140 cash from her kitchen table.

When police apprehended the so-called friend, 30-year-old Tiffany Waller, they say they found messages between the two women in which Solis asked for pills worth a suspiciously familiar amount of money.

'Before she was transported, she gave
 me consent to look in her phone,' Officer Thomas B. Troutman told the 
Tennessean. 'In her texts, it showed where Ms. Solis asked Ms. Waller to
 get her 20 Loritab (pills) for $7 a piece, which turns out to be $140.'

When Solis contacted police, she claimed that Waller had snatched the money while Solis was in the bathroom.

Upon
 her arrest, Waller told the officers that Solis had given her the money
 to get her the pills, but that Waller's dealer had stolen the money.

According to the Tennessean, Waller also told the cops that she fully intended to pay Solis back.

Waller was charged with criminal impersonation, robbery and violation of probation.

Solis was arrested and charged with felony filing a false report and criminal conspiracy.

Solis was held on $6,000 bond and slated to appear before a judge April 24.

Waller claimed to police that her own dealer, to whom she took Solis's $140, had stolen the money. She said she had every intention of paying it back
