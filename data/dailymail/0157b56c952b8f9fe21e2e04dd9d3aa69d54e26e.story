Venezuelan terrorist Carlos
the Jackal appeared in court in
Paris today and claimed: 'My profession is a revolutionary.'

The once notorious Marxist, now 62, is accused of four bomb attacks in the
early 1980s that killed 11 people.

He faces at least one life sentence if found guilty at a special anti-terrorist
Assizes set up at the Palais de Justice in the French capital.

Speaking to confirm his real name - Ilich Ramirez Sanchez - Carlos looked
relaxed and calm in jeans, sweatshirt, and a blue casual jacket as he smiled
and raised his arm in a clenched-fist salute. 

During a number
of interventions, Carlos was cheered from the public gallery as he blamed
'Imperialists' for waging war on Muslims, and attacked the 'racist Zionists of
Israel'.

Referring
to those he had killed, Carlos said he was 'sorry for the victims of the
attacks. The killed and wounded were in the wrong place at the wrong time'.

Supporters
attending the court included a number of Venezuelans who view Carlos as a
political prisoner.

As their applause
intensified, judges called for order, saying that a courtroom was not a place
to hold a political demonstration.

He had arrived in a dock made of bullet-proof glass and with a cage roof under
conditions of the tightest security from Paris's La Sante prison, where he is
already serving life for the 1975 murders of two French secret servicemen and
an informer.

Carlos, who has recently gone on a 
hunger strike over his treatment in France's most notorious prison, had 
been put into isolation for using a phone to speak to journalists about 
the upcoming trial.

After being convicted of the murders in 1997, he claimed he had been 'stitched up' by Israeli secret service, Mossad.

The new charges relate to four deadly attacks in France in 1982 and 1983, which
killed 11 people and wounded another 100.

Prosecutors allege he carried out the attacks in order to force the authorities
to release two of his accomplices, including Magdalena Kopp, whom he went on to
marry.

Today, Carlos's legal team included his third wife, barrister Isabelle
Coutant-Peyre, 58, whom the notorious womaniser married in prison a decade ago.

four terrorist attacks in France during the 1980s

Supporting her husband before the trial, Ms Coutant-Peyre said: 'He is not a
criminal but a politician, like Nelson Mandela. He is a freedom fighter - a
revolutionary.'

When it was pointed out that Carlos had admitted killing hundreds during his
career as a 'super terrorist', Ms Coutant-Peyre said: 'It's very unfortunate
for the victims, but there's always a reason in international politics.'

In another interview on the eve of the trial, Carlos admitted being responsible
for up to 2,000 deaths.

He told El Nacional, a newspaper in his home country of Venezuela, that 'of the 1,500
to 2,000, there were no more than 200 civilian casualties'.

Carlos said he co-ordinated 'over 100' attacks during his terrorist career,
claiming that 'minor errors' had seen innocent people hurt.

He also singled out America and Israel as his 'main imperialist enemies'.

Ms Coutant-Peyre is convinced she can get Carlos out of his 'filthy dungeon'
and see him returned home to Venezuela as a pardoned political prisoner.

Carlos, who got his nickname from the Frederick Forsyth novel The Day Of The
Jackal, first made international headlines in 1975 when he led a commando raid
on an Opec oil cartel meeting in Vienna.

The raid led to three deaths, with Carlos then flying to Algeria with the
dozens of hostages and ending up extracting a ransom of around £10million.

Despite his confidence, Carlos is now a pale shadow of the swashbuckling young
'revolutionary Marxist' who regularly used to appear in a Che Guevara beret and
sunglasses.

Carlos, who converted from Catholicism to Islam in 1975, denies all the current
charges which he is facing.

If convicted, he would have to serve a maximum penalty of life, with a minimum of 22 years jail.

In a letter to the Ministry of Justice, Carlos's lawyer Francis Vuillemin said his hunger strike was in response to 'the deliberate violation of my client's rights by the prison administration'.

Mr Vuillemin said a computer which Carlos had been able to use to prepare his defence case had been 'dismantled and thrown in pieces into a cardboard box, with no possibility of it being set up in his isolation cell'.

The trial, which is expected to last for a month, continues.
