A young couple are suspected of stealing a £19,000 BMW convertible after taking the car for a test drive and not returning it.

The pair asked to take the car for a test drive after walking into a showroom in Barrow, Cumbria and were allowed to take the vehicle unaccompanied.

Neither the couple or the car have been seen at Knightsbridge Cars since they took it on Thursday afternoon.

The couple, believed to be in their 30s, asked to take the BMW convertible for a test drive from Knightsbridge Cars but the car has not been seen since

The owners of the dealership have now posted CCTV images which show the couple, believed to be in their 30s, looking at cars on the forecourt before entering the showroom.

The man was wearing jeans, trainers and a grey T-shirt. The woman wore a sleeveless summer dress and sandals. They both spoke with Welsh accents.

The car, which is still listed on the showroom’s website, has 52,000 miles on the clock and is priced at £18,991.

It is described as: 'Metallic black sapphire, this is just a hugely desirable e93 cabriolet with wonderful appointments.'

Police have said the car could now be in use with different plates.

It is believed the couple were allowed 
to take the car unaccompanied because the dealership has never 
experienced similar problems.

Knightsbridge Cars was unavailable to comment on the theft but other dealers in the town have said this sort of crime is not unheard of.

Tony Dale, who runs Abbey Road Car Sales
in Barrow, said thieves struck his business three years ago making off 
with a Ford C-Max.

He said: 'It’s happened to me. A man came in with a child and said he’d take the child home and then take the car out. I thought oh, he must be in Barrow.

'The car was recovered two months later in West Mercia.

'There has got to be trust both ways but now we accompany all of our test drives.'

Jonny Stoker, sales manager at DSG in Barrow, said: 'It’s not something I’ve experienced.

'More often than not we tend to go out with our test drives, not because of a lack of trust, but a lot of people are getting into a new car and if they have questions it’s the perfect opportunity to discuss them.'

One unnamed Barrow car dealer said: 'I think any dealer would be wary so you do tend to try and find out as many details as possible.

'We would generally take a driving licence but even that can’t guarantee anything.'
