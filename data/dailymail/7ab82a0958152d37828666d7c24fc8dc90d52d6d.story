Paul Hollywood's cheeky banter, piercing blue eyes and incredible skills with pastry have gripped the nation since the Great British Bake Off arrived on our screens.

But it seems that not everyone is a fan of the silver-haired fox.

The baker and television judge has been branded an 'amateur' by a chef at high street bakery giant Greggs.

Amateur: Paul Hollywood may be one of baking's most famous faces but a Greggs employee has branded him 'amateur'

During the first episode of Sky1 documentary Greggs: More Than Meats The Pie, a professional baker was quick to insult Mary Berry's right hand man.

John Curtis, who has worked for Greggs for 33 years, said that he would have no time for staff who made bread 'as badly' as 46-year-old Paul.

Bad baker: John Curtis said that is his employees baked bread as 'badly' as seasoned baker Paul, he wouldn't have much time for them

John said: 'I watched one of his shows the other week and he was making plaited loaves and it's like, if my guys made plaited loaves like that they'd be out on their ear.'

The confident employee continued: 'I would like him to sit down and try one of my plaited loaves and I can tell him how it is done, bless him.

'Some of what he says on telly is like he is reading it out of Enid Blyton.'

Documentary: John was speaking on Sky1 documentary Greggs: More Than Meats The Pie, which goes behind the scenes of the high-street giant

Mike Gillaspy, who directs the new documentary, said that he finds the Greggs staff a very amusing group of people.

'There have been times I've had to put the camera down for laughing so much.

'They are a really interesting bunch,' he said.

Greggs: More Than Meats The Pie starts on April 29 at 9pm on Sky1 HDÂ
