An image taken by astronauts aboard the International Space Station has revealed remnants of war from space.

In the remarkable image, land fortifications and systems of gun emplacements from the Iraq-Iran war can clearly be seen.

The photograph reveals fortifications along a 12-mile (20km) stretch of the Iraq-Iran border, near the coast of the Persian Gulf.

The snapshot, captured by an astronaut during Expedition 41 on 7 November 2014, was first thought to show a series of oil-pad installations.

But on closer inspection, the ISS team realised that the strange formations aligned along the international boundary were in fact military fortifications.

The lofty vantage point of the ISS has given it access to many scenes of conflict since its permanent habitation began in 2000.

For instance, astronauts watched on in horror when they saw the terror attacks in New York on Sept 11, 2001.

Poignant footage from space showed smoke rising from New York's Twin Towers, moments after two planes smashed into them in the terror attack which killed thousands of people.

And in 2008, cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko used an 800mm telephoto lens to take images of the South Ossetia region shortly after Russian forces invaded Georgia.

Systems of large curved earthworks, circular gun emplacements, and straight connecting roads run parallel to the international border. 

This region of oil refining and exporting was the centre of numerous military actions during the war in the 1980s, especially during the defence of the southern city of Basra. 

Images and views like this are not altogether rare for astronauts aboard the ISS.

In July 2014, for example, the world watched on in horror as the conflict between Israel and Gaza escalated - and its devastating impact reached space.

Looking down from his perch on the International Space Station 260 miles (415km) above Earth, astronaut Alexander Gerst was able to see rockets lighting up the troubled area.

Gerst tweeted an image of the horrifying scenes describing it as his ‘saddest photo yet’. The image shows Tel-Aviv near the centre with the city lights of Be'er Shiva seen towards the centre left.

The Gaza Strip runs along the coast to the far left of the photo. Disturbingly, many of the explosions are seen in the densely populated regions. 

On 10 November, three days after the Iraq-Iran image was taken, three of the six members on the ISS - Russian Maxim Suraev, American Reid Wiseman and German Alexander Gerst - returned to Earth.

During their time aboard the station, the crew participated in research focusing on Earth remote sensing, advanced manufacturing, and studies of bone and muscle physiology. 

They set a milestone for station science by completing a record 82 hours of research in a single week in July.

A key research focus during their mission, Expedition 41, was human health management for long duration space travel, as Nasa and Roscosmos prepare for two crew members to spend one year aboard the space station in March 2015.

The crew welcomed five cargo spacecraft during its time aboard the orbiting laboratory. 

Two Russian ISS Progress cargo vehicles docked to the station, bringing tons of supplies in July and October. The fifth and final European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), dubbed the Georges Lemaitre after the Belgian physicist who is considered the father of the Big Bang theory, launched to the station in July.

Wiseman and Gerst ventured outside the confines of the space station for a planned spacewalk to relocate a failed pump module and configure the station for upcoming additions. 

Wiseman completed a second spacewalk with fellow Nasa astronaut Barry Wilmore. Suraev also conducted one spacewalk during Expedition 41.

In addition to being a scientific research platform, the space station also serves as a test bed to demonstrate new technology. The first 3-D printer to be tested in space arrived at the station during Expedition 41. It will be the first step toward establishing an on-demand machine shop in space, which is a critical enabling component for deep space crewed missions and in-space manufacturing.

A new Earth monitoring instrument called RapidScat also was installed and activated on the station during the crew’s time in orbit. RapidScat will measure Earth's ocean surface wind speed and direction, essential measurements used in weather prediction.

Many other conflicts have been seen by astronauts from space. Here, looking down from his perch 260 miles (415km) above Earth, astronaut Alexander Gerst was able to see rockets lighting up the area as the conflict between Israel and Gaza escalated in July 2014
