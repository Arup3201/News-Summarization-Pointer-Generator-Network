Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown is set to announce he will quit as an MP at the next General Election. 

He is expected to formally reveal his plans to stand down 'within days' after 32 years in the Commons, sources have claimed. 

One close colleague predicted he may write to Labour Party members in his Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath constituency in the next few days and make a formal announcement before Christmas.

Sources claim Mr Brown is eager to bow out 'on a high' after he was widely credited for helping keep Britain together with a passionate 'war cry' in Glasgow the day before votes were cast.

Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown will step down after 32 years in the House of Commons 

A close ally of the former Labour PM disclosed to the Sunday Mirror: 'Gordon has confirmed to friends that he will stand down at the election in May.

'He wants to go out on a high after effectively salvaging the campaign to keep the UK together in September. He will focus on his charity work.'

'Gordon always holds a function for his party members at Christmas and if I were a betting man, I would bet that he will make an announcement then,' a source told Sky News.

Another senior source said: 'I'm reliably informed he will make an announcement in the coming weeks.'

Sources revealed that Mr Brown is quitting politics to focus on his charity work along with his wife Sarah

Since losing the 2010 election to David Cameron, Mr Brown has concentrated along with his wife Sarah on charity work and his role as UN Special Envoy for Global Education.

The 63-year-old had been criticised by political opponents for his rare appearances in the Commons until his stirring comeback in the Scottish referendum. 

In the Glasgow speech viewed as the crucial turning point for the Union, Mr Brown tore into Alex Salmond, insisting Scotland does not belong to him or any other politician, declaring: 'Scotland belongs to all of us.'

Speaking without notes, he urged anyone with doubts about the risks of separation to vote No to save the Union, adding: 'What we created together, let no nationalist split asunder.' 

Gordon Brown was widely credited with keeping Britain together, especially after his passionate speech

The former Prime Minister Mr Brown was one of the stand-out performers of the No campaign 

His departure is another hammer blow for the Labour Party in Scotland which could lose a swath of seats to the SNP in May. The announcement of the new Scottish Labour leader will be made on December 13, with Jim Murphy the favourite to land the role.   

The former Prime Minister will not bow to calls to take up a senior Labour role in Scotland to help the party get back on track north of the border. Allies also say he has no plans to take up a seat in the House of Lords. 

His resignation is also likely to see a fight among the party's rising stars for the safe seat of Kirkcadly and Cowdenbeath which won a majority of more than 23,000 in the last election.

Mr Brown's intentions to stand down come after his former Chancellor Alistair Darling announced earlier this month that he would stand down as an MP in May.

Mr Brown entered the House of Commons in 1983 when he won a majority of 11,000 in Dunfermline East

After Labour's landslide election victory in 1997, Gordon Brown became Chancellor of the Exchequer

Mr Brown became the longest-serving Chancellor in modern history and was in the job for 10 years

There were reports Mr Brown became increasingly frustrated at having to wait for Mr Blair to give up power

The former Prime Minister entered the House of Commons as a member for Dunfermline East in 1983, where he secured a majority of 11,000 in 1983.

He joined the Shadow Cabinet in 1989 as Shadow Secretary of State for Trade, and was later promoted to become Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1992. 

After Labour's landslide victory in 1997 where it won a massive 179-seat majority, he was appointed Chancellor. 

In that position, he became the longest-serving holder of that office in modern history. 

Over his 10 years at the Treasury, Mr Brown earned a reputation as the 'Iron Chancellor' who promised there would be no return to 'boom and bust.'

Days into the role he gave the Bank of England the freedom to set interest rates through the Bank's monetary policy committee in a move that was widely praised. 

While Mr Brown helped oversee strong growth in the UK economy, he attracted criticism for his decision to scrap tax relief on pension funds and his abolition of the 10p tax rate paid by people on low incomes. 

After years of waiting to become Prime Minister, Mr Brown finally entered No 10 on June 27, 2007

In his first few months in charge, Mr Brown was praised for for his handling of crises including failed terrorist attacks, flooding, a foot and mouth disease outbreak and the run on Northern Rock

Having been made PM, Mr Brown enjoyed an uneasy relationship with the media - he is pictured here in 2008 shaking hands with Elisabeth Murdoch, Baroness Amos and Rebekah Wade, the former editor of the Sun

While on the campaign trail in Rochdale ahead of the 2010 general election, Mr Brown was caught on microphone describing local pensioner Gillian Duffy as 'bigoted' when she quizzed him about immigration

After losing the election, Mr Brown resigned as Prime Minister on May 10, 2010 and leader of the Labour Party

It has never been confirmed when - if at all - Mr Blair agreed to step aside and relinquish power to Mr Brown, but there were reports the Chancellor was becoming increasingly frustrated at having to wait. 

He eventually replaced Mr Blair at No 10 Downing Street in June 2007. He is the sixth post-war Prime Minister, of a total of 12, to assume the role without having won a general election.

In his first few months in charge, Mr Brown was praised for for his handling of crises including failed terrorist attacks, flooding, a foot and mouth disease outbreak and the run on Northern Rock. 

But after initial success, Labour's popularity under Mr Brown started to dwindle with the onset of the global recession in 2008. 

The following year Labour suffered poor results in the local and European elections. 

While on the campaign trial ahead of the 2010 general election, Mr Brown was caught on microphone describing local pensioner Gillian Duffy as 'bigoted' after she quizzed him about immigration. His political opponents said the gaffe was evidence he held voters in contempt.

In the election, Labour lost 91 seats, the party's biggest loss of seats in a single general election since 1931 and days later Mr Brown resigned as Prime Minister and leader of the Labour Party. 

Since then, Mr Brown faced criticism for his rare appearance in the Commons and even described himself as an ex-politician during a summit on education in Qatar last year. 

But the former Prime Minister made a storming return to front-line politics when he helped galvanise support for the Union during the Scottish independence referendum.  

The second son of Rev Dr John Ebenezer Brown, a Church of Scotland minister, Gordon Brown was brought up in Kirkcaldy, a small coastal town north of Edinburgh in Scotland.

At the age of 16, he joined Edinburgh University to study history becoming the youngest undergraduate there since the war.

He became a Labour MP for Dunfermline East at the second attempt in 1983 with a majority of 11,000, after briefly working as a lecturer and TV reporter, and began forging an alliance with fellow MP Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson.

He was made chancellor in 1992, choosing not to stand for leadership thereby clearing the way for Blair, on the understanding he would retain power at some point. 

After Labour's 1997 landslide victory, Brown became the most powerful chancellor in modern times.

But he never stopped coveting the top job and  spend much of the next 10 years pushing Blair to make good on their deal.

Gordon Brown enjoyed a mixed relationship with Tony Blair and craved the leadership for many years

When Blair finally stood down in 2007, after winning three Labour election victories, Brown was made party leader, and prime minister, without a contest. 

However he found the job he had so craved more difficult than he envisaged and he struggled, particularly with the onset of the global recession in 2008.  

After a disastrous showing in the local and European elections in 2009, he lost the 2010 general election campaign after losing more than 90 Labour MPs in what was Labour's worst electoral performance since Michael Foot in 1983. 

Mr Brown returned to the front line political stage for the Scottish referendum and played a crucial role in keeping the Union with a barnstorming speech in Glasgow the day before votes were cast.
