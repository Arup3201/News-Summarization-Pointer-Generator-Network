Wojciech Szczesny has been pictured with his FA Cup medal and hugging the famous trophy despite not playing a single second in the FA Cup this season.

Arsenal's first-choice goalkeeper had to play second fiddle throughout the tournament to Lukasz Fabianski, but took his place among the bench at Wembley for Saturday's dramatic win over Hull.

The Poland keeper, who shared the 'Golden Glove' award with Petr Cech after 16 clean sheets in the Premier League this term, stormed the pitch to celebrate with his team-mates before leading the celebrations during Arsenal's open-top bus parade 24 hours later.

But after nine long years without a trophy at Arsenal you would not begrudge anyone at the north London club celebrating their Cup triumph.

The Gunners almost blew their chance to win Saturday's final after Hull took a surprise 2-0 lead with just eight minutes of the game gone.

But Arsene Wenger's side bounced back through a Santi Cazorla free-kick before Laurent Koscielny equalised after 71 minutes. Aaron Ramsey then scored the winner with 11 minutes remaining of extra-time remaining.

Wenger, who is set to sign a new deal at Arsenal, now sits alongside Sir Alex Ferguson in having won the FA Cup five times.

'It will force you first to be a bit more creative in the press conferences, but I trust you will be, I don't worry too much for that,' said Wenger on ending their trophyless streak.

'I have nothing against this question if you say that in the other clubs as well, there are some clubs who haven't won for 20 years and they don't get this question at all.

'But basically, the whole club and the 
fans were under that kind of pressure for not having won for years, but 
that will help to get that off our shoulders a little bit and focus on 
getting stronger.'

Wenger revealed he intends to sort out his new contract in the coming weeks. 'Yes (it will be done), because I go to Brazil on the 10th of June,' he said.

Arsenal, though, still have to resolve whether full-back Bacary Sagna will remain, the France defender's deal set to expire this summer with Manchester City a possible destination, before they can look to bring in new recruits.

'First, we have to wait for Sagna - what will he do? - and (goalkeeper Lukasz) Fabianski. After, we have to bring in two or three players to strengthen the squad that is for sure,' said Wenger. 'Unfortunately, everywhere we go, there are many teams on the market at the moment.'
