Lots of young women are thinking about gym visits or diets right now to prepare their bikini bodies for the summer months ahead.

But one 23-year-old is doing the complete opposite and force feeding herself - often through a funnel - in a bid to become as fat as possible.

Tammy Jung was once a healthy eight-stone teenager who wore skinny jeans, loved playing volleyball and going out with friends.

But in a bizarre reversal of a crash diet, Tammy has decided that she wants to put on a lot of weight as quickly as possible, and spends her days indoors eating buckets of fried chicken, boxes of doughnuts and whole blocks of cheese.

Before and after: Tammy, from Los Angeles, 
California, used to be a slim pretty teenager but bizarrely made the 
decision to go on a reverse crash diet, trying to gain weight as quickly
 as possible, for the sake of online fame

She even allows boyfriend Johan 
Ubermen, 28, to pour ice cream milkshakes down her throat in an attempt
 to ingest 5,000 calories a day.

Tammy's
 frightening diet has seen her weight soar by over 3st every six months,
 and she now weighs over 16st - just over halfway to her goal weight.

The once 
svelte young woman is piling on the pounds to earn money as a Big 
Beautiful Woman on internet websites and hopes to one day top 30st.

Tammy, who already has fat-loving male 
fans from around the world, has been warned she is putting her health at
 risk and shortening her life.

But the determined young 'gainer' celebrates every pound she adds and insists she doesn't care about damaging her body.

She said: 'I've never been happier than I am working to put on weight - nothing will stop me achieving my dream.

'I know it's controversial but it's no one else's business - eating makes me happy.

'I'm making lots of money doing what I love - and I want to make even more.

'As far as I'm concerned there is no such thing as too big.'

Slimmer days: As a teenager, Tammy played volley ball and soccer and weighed a healthy eight stone, but felt insecure despite her healthy frame

Aided by her 'feeder' boyfriend Johan, Tammy's daily diet includes up to 30 doughnuts as well as stacks of pancakes and waffles.

The couple can spend up to £70 a day on takeaways and junk food to fuel Tammy's mammoth  appetite.

Tammy
 said: 'I start the day with a huge breakfast of waffles, cream cheese, 
bacon and sausage then head to McDonalds for a few burgers in the 
afternoon.

'I can snack on cheese all day, a couple of blocks is no problem, then for dinner I'll either eat pizzas or make Mexican food.

'At the end of the day I make a weight gain shake from heavy whipped cream and a whole tub of ice cream, which Yohan feeds me through a funnel.

'The funnel forces me to drink the shake even when I'm full after a day of eating.'

As a teenager, Tammy played volley ball and football and weighed a healthy eight stone, but felt insecure despite her healthy frame.

Bigger is better: With a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 45, 5ft 2" Tammy is almost twice the average for a woman her size

Encouragement: She is being encouraged to gain weight by her feeder boyfriend Johan Ubermen, 28, who helps her by buying £70 of junk food per day and making thick ice-cream milkshakes which he feeds to her

Short life span: Tammy doesn't care that she is putting her life at risk

She said: 'I used to be self-conscious about my appearance. I always thought I was fat and had low self esteem.

'After
 I gave up sports, I began putting on weight. At first I was in denial. 
But one day I looked in the mirror and realised I was fat - and I felt 
great about it.

'My body looks so sexy and I feel more womanly the heavier I get.'

Tammy even films herself eating on camera for her army of online fans.

Funnel fed: Tammy weighs 16.5 stone but scoffs up to 5,000 calories each day by feasting on fried chicken, dozens of doughnuts and blocks of cheese through a funnel

She said: 'I get a lot of requests to eat and weigh myself on camera. Some guys even send me scripts so I know what to say.

'I can make up to £1,000 a month if I work at it, and I'm hoping to earn more the bigger I get.'

Johan, her boyfriend of eight months, doesn't worry about the attention from other men.

He
 said: 'I noticed early on that she really likes to eat and was eating 
more than me when we went for dinner - I was impressed.

'I would love her no matter what she looked like.'

Incredibly, Tammy's family have no idea what she does for a living - or that her weight gain is deliberate.

She said: 'My family have noticed that I am putting on weight but they still don't know I'm doing it on purpose.

'They probably wouldn't agree with it but I'm making a living and supporting myself.'

Dr Claude Matar, of the Pasadena Weight Loss Center, said: 'It's very straightforward, she is causing her life to be shorter. She is taking the risk of dying early.'

Just the way he likes her: 'My body looks so sexy and I feel more womanly the heavier I get' said Tammy, and her boyfriend doesn't mind that she gets attention from other men
