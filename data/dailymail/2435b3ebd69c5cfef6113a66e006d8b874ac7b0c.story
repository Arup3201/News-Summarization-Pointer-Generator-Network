You might think you’re looking at an idyllic part of the Caribbean - but these photographs were actually taken off England’s south-west coast.

Bathers were seen today enjoying outstanding tropical aqua seas off Porthcurno, Cornwall, as Britain basked in more glorious weather.

With a high of 30C (86F) expected in the South and 28C (82F) in Scotland, Britons were experiencing warmer climes than parts of Portugal and Spain.

Yesterday's high of 29.9C (85F) in 
Solent, Hampshire could be beaten, according to the Met Office, which 
predicted highs will continue until the weekend.

And
 the news was also good for the start of the Commonwealth Games, with a 
sunny and warm day forecast in Glasgow tomorrow with 27C (81F) highs.

There
 is a 10 per cent chance of rain tomorrow, but this falls to just 2 per 
cent on Friday, with temperatures again predicted to be in the mid-20s.

Conditions are expected to remain warm but become more unsettled over the weekend, with the possibility of showers.

Going into the early part of next 
week, the weather looks more mixed as the current easterly wind changes 
to a westerly coming off the Atlantic.

There
 was a 2014 high in Scotland and Wales today, with 28.7C (84F) at 
Porthmadog in Gwynedd, and 27.9C (82F) at Achnagart in Inverness-shire.

However,
 the Met Office has issued a yellow 'be aware' rain warning for tomorrow
 afternoon and evening in Cornwall, Devon, Dorset and Somerset.

And
 ultraviolet radiation levels were very high for the UK today and 
tomorrow - with the worst areas being the South West today and South 
East tomorrow.

But 
forecaster Emma Corrigan warned that the hot weather brings a risk of 
heavy downpours, saying that rain could hit the South West this week.

She added: ‘There is a risk of isolated heavy thunderstorms in the south west on Wednesday and Thursday and perhaps into Friday.’

August, while expected to begin with fine and dry weather, could see lower temperatures than July as a ‘frontal feature’ pushes in from the South East.

Billy Payne, a forecaster with Meteogroup, said August ‘should get off to a fairly dry and settled start’ with a build-up of high pressure.

He said next week will bring a slight drop in temperatures but still possible highs of 23C (73F) in the South of England on Monday.

While temperatures are likely to remain high this week, they will probably not beat the 2014 UK record of 32.3C (90F) set last Friday in Gravesend, Kent.
