Rachael Ray's family suffered tragedy over the Thanksgiving holiday after her elderly aunt collapsed and died in the freezing cold when she became locked out of the chef's mother's home.

Aunt Geraldine Scuderi, 77, was house-sitting for Ray's mother Elsa Scuderi when she locked herself out of the house in upstate New York on November 29 as temperatures dipped to 9F.

Around four in the afternoon, the woman reportedly went outside to feed the birds but could not get back into the home, desperately trying to break a window. She died of a heart attack, according to an autopsy report.

Geraldine Dominica Scuderi of Queensbury, New York, passed away on November 29 at the age of 77 after becoming trapped outside a home she was house-sitting for Rachael Ray's mother in the bitter cold

Gina Mesnick, a cousin of Food Network star Rachael Ray, told National Enquirer: 'My mother is dead today because the Ray family neglected her.'

Speaking of her mother's death, she added: 'At some point in the evening, I suspect that, because of her [chronic lung problems], she had trouble breathing and collapsed in the driveway and basically died there. Her body wasn’t found until the following morning.'

The Enquirer claims that the 77-year-old aunt, who had a history of heart problems, had not been left a key to get back into the home.

Ms Mesnick told the magazine that her mother was not given a key while house-sitting five days a week - for which she was paid $300 - but had to share with another house-sitter.

Neighbors close to the property were home at the time but it appears that the elderly woman was unable to make it the short distance for help. Mrs Scuderi's body was found the day after she died.

Ms Ray along with her producer husband John Cusimano missed her aunt's funeral on December 5 due to work commitments.

The Warren County sheriff's office confirmed to MailOnline on Wednesday that Mrs Scuderi had died of natural causes and there was no suspicious circumstances surrounding her death.  Lt Steven Stockdale said that there was no investigation into Mrs Scuderi's death.

A representative for Rachael Ray told MailOnline on Wednesday: 'Unfortunately, the day of Rachael's aunt's funeral (December 5) coincided with the final day of taping for the 2013 season of her daytime talk show.

'Her tape schedule could not be rescheduled partly because Rachael was committed to a live television broadcast on December 6 followed by a cross country book tour.

'Rachael has payed her respects privately and will spend more time with her family when she returns home.'
