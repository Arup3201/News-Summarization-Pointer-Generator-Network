David Cameron today admitted voters are ‘frustrated’ at the pace of action to tackle immigration into Britain.

The Prime Minister said voters wanted the government to go further and faster in curbing the numbers of people arriving in the UK.

It comes as ministers prepare for figures – to be released on the day of the European elections - which are expected to show net migration from within the European Union has overtaken arrivals from the rest of the world.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics show how net migration among people from elsewhere in Europe is on course to overtake those from outside the EU

Mr Cameron has promised to reduce net migration – the difference between the numbers arriving and those leaving – to less than 100,000 by 2015.

But after falling in the early days of the coalition it has started to rise again, fuelled by growing numbers of people arriving from the rest of Europe.

Ukip has stepped up pressure on the government with an aggressive campaign, warning the government can do nothing about the issue while Britain remains in the EU.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage has boasted that he will trigger a ‘political earthquake’ by winning the European Parliament elections on May 22, pushing the Tories into third.

Now it has emerged that within weeks new figures will show how net migration from within the EU is responsible for the majority of the population rise linked to immigration.

In the year to September net migration stood at 212,000, which the Office for National Statistics said was a ‘statistically significant increase’ from 154,000 in the previous year.

David Cameron claimed support for Nigel Farage's Ukip was fuelled by public frustration by the pace of progress in tackling immmigration

More detailed figures show that net migration of EU citizens almost doubled to 131,000 from 65,000 the previous year.

An estimated 209,000 citizens from the rest of the EU arrived in the UK, the highest since records began in 1964. At the same time only 78,000 left.

It means that net migration from within the EU stood at 131,000, just 10,000 lower than the figure for non-EU migrants. Just two years ago the gap was more than 150,000.

The figures expose how government action to tackle immigration is hindered by EU freedom of movement laws.

While rules have been tightened for people from outside the EU, little can be done for EU nationals.

Mr Cameron admitted the issue has left voters frustrated, which was part of the rason for the surge in support for Ukip.

He told BBC Breakfast: ‘I think there are lots of things happening here. First of all we’ve been through a very painful and difficult recession that has caused damage to families right up and down our country, we’re recovering from that, we’ve got more people in work, people are seeing our economy turn round, but it takes time and people feel frustrated by that.

‘Added to that, you’ve got issues like immigration, like reform of welfare, where I would argue this government has made huge progress, but people would like us to go further and faster and they’re frustrated by that.’
