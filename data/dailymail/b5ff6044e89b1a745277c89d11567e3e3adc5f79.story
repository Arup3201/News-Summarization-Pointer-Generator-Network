Virgin tycoon Sir Richard Branson has backed a £2.6m fundraising drive to keep his favourite childhood beach from falling into the hands of developers.

The National Trust is trying to buy 'magical' Bantham Beach in south Devon after its owners put it up for sale earlier this month.

The seaside idyll inspired Agatha Christie and is a favourite holiday spot of tycoon Sir Richard who says the British coastline is at risk of being overdeveloped and spoiled for future generations.

His comments prompted speculation that the billionaire businessman will make a sizeable contribution to the fund - or even buy the beach for himself.

Sir Richard said: 'I have a strong connection to Bantham, having holidayed there as a child.

'My dad used to take me down there in a little bumpyed-bump (corr) car and we would catch sand eels to use as bait to go fishing for bass.

'My daughter, Holly has a number of good friends that live there.

'A lot of the UK's coastline is being overdeveloped and spoiled for future generations.

'We therefore need to get behind the National Trust in their campaign to save one of England's most beautiful and untouched beaches at Bantham.'

Fancy it? Family-owned Evans Estates put the entire hamlet of Bantham up for sale, including 728 acres of land, 21 homes, a golf course a shop for £11.5 million

The National Trust decided to act after family-owned Evans Estates put the entire hamlet of Bantham up for sale, including 728 acres of land, 21 homes, a golf course a shop for £11.5 million.

Trust officials decided against buying the homes but hope to secure the beach and the surrounding Avon estuary for £7.2million.

The initial £4.6 million will come from the Trust's Neptune Coastline Campaign pot, set up to save and care for some of the UK's most vulnerable stretches of coastline.

A further £2.6m will need to come from public donations but only £36,000 has been raised so far.
