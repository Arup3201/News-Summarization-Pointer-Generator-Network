Jessa Duggar proudly shared her pro-life views as she joined her family for an anti-abortion march in Arkansas on Sunday.

The 19 Kids and Counting star and her husband, Ben Seewald, headed to Little Rock to participate in March for Life on Sunday afternoon.

They were also joined by her parents Michelle and Jim Bob, as well as at least 11 of her siblings, who all posed for snaps outside the Capitol.

'Headed to Little Rock right now,' she wrote on Instagram early in the morning. 'Join us at our state Capitol at 2 pm, and together let us take a stand for the life of the unborn.'

Family day out: Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar were at the rally with at least 12 of their children on Sunday

She later shared another image of a banner that read: 'God Loves Every Life from Beginning to End.'

They were also snapped with fans, while Jessa's parents and 10 of her siblings.

The rally was the 36th March for Life, which is held every year to protest the Roe v. Wade decision by the Supreme Court to legalize abortion. 

Noticeably absent from the pro-life parade was her pregnant sister Jill, who had instead opted for night out at Chinese restaurant P.F. Changs with her husband, Derick Dillard.

'#datenight with my amazing hubby,' she wrote on Instagram.

Jill is 30 weeks along and is expecting a boy, E! reported. 

Jessa has previously been outspoken about her anti-abortion stance. In September, she compared abortion to the Holocaust after sharing her thoughts following a visit to the Holocaust Museum.

'May we never sit idly by and allow such an atrocity to happen again,' she wrote. 'Not this generation. We must be a voice for those who cannot speak up for themselves. Because EVERY LIFE IS PRECIOUS.'

But the post sparked outrage, with some calling her 'naive'.

'Do not use the Holocaust as an excuse to preach about your religion,' one wrote. 'Abortion has nothing to do with the slaughter of millions of people. You should be ashamed of yourself.'

In the weeks before her post, her then-fiance wrote a Facebook post about the responsibility of young people to 'end the abortion holocaust'.

And in January, Jessa's father Jim Bob told Life Site News that he, too, was reminded of abortion when he visited the Holocaust Museum - so much so that he feels there should be a 'Life Museum' dedicated to 'how abortion started in America, how it became legal, and all the tragic stories that have happened.'

Jill Duggar missed out on the family trip and opted for dinner at P.F. Chang's with her husband Derick instead
