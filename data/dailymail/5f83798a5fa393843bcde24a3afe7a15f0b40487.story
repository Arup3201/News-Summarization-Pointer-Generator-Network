Thousands have claimed the most watched Sports Personality of the Year for 20 years was tainted last night as they could not vote because the BBC's phone system crumbled.

After a vintage year of sporting achievement for Britain, Tour de France winner and Olympic gold medallist Bradley Wiggins won the prize with nearly a third of all the 1.6million votes.

Almost 500,000 backed the cyclist - more than the total number of people who voted last year.

But some of the 14.5million viewers have complained they had to call 100 times to vote once or failed to get through at all.

Instead they were forced to listen to an 
engaged tone or an error message.

1. Bradley Wiggins 492,064 (30.25%)

2. Jessica Ennis 372,765 (22.92%)

3. Andy Murray 230,444 (14.17%)

4. Mo Farah 131,327 (8.07%)

5. David Weir 114,633 (7.05%)

6. Ellie Simmonds 102,894 (6.33%)

7. Sir Chris Hoy 42,961 (2.64%)

8. Nicola Adams 35,560 (2.19%)

9. Ben Ainslie 35,373 (2.17%)

10. Rory McIlroy 29,729 (1.83%)

11. Katherine Grainger 28,626 (1.76%)

12. Sarah Storey 10,342 (0.64%)Â 

Total votes: 1,626,718

Others complained the 35-minute window for voting was far too short - which caused the logjam - and argued the format should have included text and online voting.

One voter claimed he tried 100 times to vote for Andy Murray but could not get through, while another claimed she tried 61 times to vote for Nicola Adams.

Another said it took 12 attempts for her vote for Jessica Ennis to register - although the problem calls probably would not have changed the result in the end.

Alasdair Stephen tweeted: 'Tried voting for Andy Murray. 100 attempts but can't get through.'

@Fletcherdene tweeted: 'Just tried voting for SPOTY & BT announced network is too busy. They need more lines available.'

Charlotte Glass tweeted: 'What a joke, 1/2 hour to call vote for SPOTY and the lines are engaged. Who decided on this method of voting, why not text???'

Mark Parry tweeted: "Well that was ridiculous, voting lines only being open for 30 minutes. Why couldn't they have been open all show. I never got through.'

Rags Martel tweeted: 'Great show by BBC - but telephone voting failed. Didn't get through once in 30 mins' while Sebastian du Feu said: 'If the voting just closed, how did they get a trophy to Miami and tee up Murray and Lennox Lewis? Bit odd.'

Anger: Just one of the examples of the thousands frustrated because they could not get through

Pressure: As more than 1.6 million voted the BBC system creaked because of the volume of calls

But the BBC played down any problems today.

'We have had confirmation by the network operators that there were no reported problems with the telephone system,' a corporation spokesman said.

'Any issues around not being able to get through to the telephone numbers may have resulted from temporary congestion caused by the unusual number of callers dialling the same number at the same time. Any issues should have been temporary and resolved by redialling soon after.'

The 14.5 million viewers last night made it the most successful sports personality for at least 20 years.

One in three people watching TV tuned in and it had an an average audience of 10.6 million viewers.

As Mr Wiggins received the prestigious award from the Duchess of Cambridge at 10.30pm 14.5million watched.

Last year the show was panned after it was moved to a Thursday night where only 4.3million saw it.

The previous record was in 2003 when England had won the rugby world cup but that was still only 8.3million.
