A teenage girl who was kicked in the face and beaten by a student in her class has been suspended despite the vicious attack being caught on camera.

Fellow students at the Texas school filmed the moment the teenager was punched and kicked to the ground in her classroom.

But when her father contacted the Harris County school he was told his daughter was to be suspended along with her attacker.

Brutal: Fellow students at Cypress Ridge High School film as the teenage girl is punched and kicked to the floor 

'You don’t expect to see these kinds of things happening in a classroom,' Eric Green said.

Within a few hours of the attack taking place at Cypress Ridge High School on May 28, cell phone footage was uploaded to the internet.

It shows the senior, who asked not to be named, being attacked until other students in her class pull the other girl away.

The victim, who says she just likes to make people laugh, claims she was forced to defend herself after being attacked at the end of sixth period.

'Where’s the teacher,' Mr Green said. 'Why didn’t they step in and do something about this?'

He told KHOU that when he contacted the school's assistant principal he was told both girls would be suspended over the fight. 

'He basically told me we had two 
students that got in a fight. We had mutual combat. 
That was it.  She was being suspended. The other student was being 
suspended,' Mr Green said.

Concerns: Eric Green says he no longer feels Cypress Ridge High School is a safe place for his daughter

His daughter said her mind went blank when the girl, who she describes as a bully, began hitting her.

'I didn’t know what to do or what to think,' she said. 'I don’t even know how to fight.'

A teacher who was in the classroom at the time hit the panic button to alert emergency administrators, but cell phone footage shows it was other students and not an adult who broke it up.

'The teacher's in the classroom, but she has no control of the classroom,' Mr Green told NewsFix.

In a statement sent to NewsFix, a school spokesman said: 'Two female students engaged in a physical altercation that was captured on video by a fellow student. The classroom teacher immediately responded to the situation by requesting emergency administrative assistance.'

The statement added: 'The campus administration conducted an investigation and the students involved were disciplined according to the Student Code of Conduct.'

Mr Green however, said: 'It wasn't a fight, it was really an assault.

The father says he now fears for the safety of his daughter and other children at the school.

'My concern is Cy-Ridge have no system in place to protect my child while she’s in school. And it’s not just my child. It could be anybody’s child,' he said.
