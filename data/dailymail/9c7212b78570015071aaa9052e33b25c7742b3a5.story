'What's the deal with politics?' Cosmo Kramer asks from the floor of a crowded parliament house in Canberra. 'I don't get it. Am I right people?'

In the latest YouTube send-up by political satirist Huw Parkinson, the cast of Seinfeld take on Australian politics. And they've gone viral.

The heads of Jerry, Elaine, Kramer and George have been seamlessly transposed onto the bodies of Australian leaders in Parliament.

'Whats the deal with politics?' Kramer asks the Australian parliament in the mock up You Tube clip

Jerry Seinfeld addresses the media, flanked by Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Attorney General George Brandis

In one scene, George points the finger at Bill Shorten; 'Well the jerk store called,' he says, 'They're running out of you!', to which he is berated by the House Speaker Bronwyn Bishop:

'The Minister will refer to people by their correct name.'

In another scene, Elaine is pictured behind Shorten at a frantic press conference, rolling her eyes and looking disgusted.

'This guy smells,' she winces, 'Doesn't anyone buy deodorant in this city, what's so hard? You take the cap off and roll it on!'

Elaine looks less than impressed by 'this guy' who smells at a press conference

Other shots included Elaine smoking a cigar after PM Tony Abbott announces he's confident 'this is a budget that's fair,' and Tanya Plibersek being heckled from the bench.

Meanwhile, the rolling news feed on a spoof live cross to Canberra flashes: 'Scott Morrison says 'Yadda, yadda, yadda No more boat arrivals.'

You can view some of Parkinson's other popular send-ups on his Vimeo channel Rabbit and Coffee.
