Former NFL star Aaron Hernandez today pleaded not guilty to murdering a semi-professional footballer who was found shot dead near his Massachusetts home in June.

The 23-year-old only spoke to say 'not guilty' to each of the counts read out in Fall River Superior Court on Friday as the mother of his alleged victim, Odin Lloyd, sobbed throughout the proceedings.

The former New England Patriots tight end was indicted last month, when he was hit with a laundry list of criminal charges, including first-degree murder, carrying a firearm and possession of a firearm.

He pleaded not guilty to the six charges as his fiancee Shayanna Jenkins and supporters wearing 'Free AH 81' looked on. He will continue to be held without bail until his next hearing in October.

The emotional response from Lloyd's family came as his girlfriend, Shaneah Jenkins, told NECN that she's tired of the focus on Hernandez. Jenkins' sister is engaged to Hernandez.

'Every time thereâ€™s a story out it's always about the alleged murder and it's not about the tragedy that happened to Odin,' she said. 'The loss that all of us have taken and the fact that he is a human and his life was taken.'

Prosecutors claim that Hernandez 
orchestrated Lloyd's killing because he was upset at him for talking to 
people Hernandez had problems with at a nightclub days earlier.

It has also been suggested that he killed Lloyd because he knew about Hernandez's involvement in a 2012 double homicide. Hernandez has never been charged in that case.

Hernandez and two other men, Ernest 
Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, allegedly picked Lloyd up at his home in 
Dorchester on June 17 and drove to the industrial park. His body was 
found by a jogger later that day.

Hernandez,
who was dropped by the Patriots within hours of his arrest on June 26, 
could face life in prison without parole if convicted.

Defense attorney Charles Rankin said Hernandez's lawyers are confident that Hernandez will be exonerated during a trial.

'Not one shred of evidence has been presented yet,' he said.

Shortly
before Lloyd's death, authorities say, Lloyd sent his sister text 
messages.

He asked if she had seen who he was with when he got into the 
car in Boston.

Then he indicated who it was in a way that Lloyd's family said he knew his sister would understand. 'NFL,' he wrote. 'Just so you know.'

Moments later, authorities say, Lloyd was dead after gunshots rang out in an unpaved construction area by a warehouse after he apparently got out of the car for what he thought was a bathroom break.

Authorities have not said who fired the shots, but according to court documents, Ortiz told police in Florida that Wallace said it was Hernandez.

Wallace has pleaded not guilty to a charge of accessory to murder after the fact. Ortiz has pleaded not guilty to a firearm charge. Both are being held in jail without bail.

Authorities have said they haven't found the murder weapon, which they believe was a .45-caliber Glock pistol, but warrants released earlier this month suggested Hernandez may have asked his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, to dispose of it.

Hernandez's cousin, Tanya Singleton, 
also was indicted on a criminal contempt charge after prosecutors say 
she refused to testify before the grand jury hearing evidence in the 
case, even after they offered her immunity. Her attorney has agreed she 
be held without bail.

Hernandez is also connected to the investigation of a 2012 double homicide near a Boston nightclub.

While
probing Lloyd's death, police found an SUV, sought in the earlier 
killing, at the home of Hernandez's uncle in Bristol, Connecticut. It 
had been rented in Hernandez's name.

Hernandez,
who has appeared in court six times since his arrest, will appear in 
court once again for his pre-trial hearing on October 9. He continues to
be held without bail.

Charged: Ernest Wallace is escorted by a court officer while departing Attleboro District Court, in Attleboro, Massachusetts last month. Prosecutors say he was with Hernandez when Lloyd was killed

Accused: Carlos Ortiz, pictured at a hearing in June, said it was Hernandez who pulled the trigger
