Union leaders are telling MPs to vote against a proposed ban on aborting babies on the grounds of their gender.

A document circulated by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) argued that the amendment to make sex-selective abortions illegal would ‘divide communities’.

It also suggests there can be ‘compelling circumstances’ to allow abortion of female foetuses – such as if a woman is at risk of domestic abuse.

The TUC has urged Labour MPs to oppose a ban on  sex-selective abortion which will be debated today

The unions’ intervention into the debate provoked a major row last night ahead of today’s vote on the issue.

Religious groups, including Asian community leaders and representatives of the Muslim, Hindu and Sikh faiths, said there was no division on the practice and that they all viewed sex- selective abortion as abhorrent.

There was also a furious reaction from MPs, including some from Union-backed Labour, who demanded to know why the TUC was telling them how to vote on an issue of conscience.

Some senior Tories accused the unions of trying to use their financial muscle and influence over Labour to manipulate voting.

The practice of aborting babies because of their gender has long been suspected to exist among some Asian communities, in which sons are said to be more valued than daughters.

Tory MP Fiona Bruce’s amendment, which has been promised support by 100 MPs, attempts to clear up confusion about whether the practice is illegal.

It seeks to establish in law that ‘nothing in section one of the Abortion Act 1967 is to be interpreted as allowing a pregnancy to be terminated on the grounds of the sex of the unborn child’.

But Labour MPs have been urged to ‘consider opposing this amendment’ by the TUC.

An email signed by the Congress’s Westminster representative Isobel Larkin said there was no evidence to suggest sex-selective abortion has been happening and that official guidance already says an abortion cannot be authorised by gender alone.

It added: ‘The amendment does not attempt to address the root causes of deeply entrenched gender discrimination but rather has divided communities.’

Last night, Labour MP Mary Glindon said: ‘To [suggest] the amendment is dividing communities is unsubstantiated ... they won’t have any evidence.’

Tory MP Julian Brazier said: ‘It is a great shame that the TUC, which represents the lion’s share of the paymasters of the Labour Party, has chosen to intervene in this way.’ Miss Larkin claimed the support of several community groups, but only named one specifically Asian organisation – the Newham Asian Women’s Project.

The briefing paper sent round by the TUC suggested it could be right in some circumstances for a doctor to approve sex-selective abortion – for example, if a woman did not want a girl for ‘cultural’ reasons and could be abused by her husband if she kept the baby.

It's offensive rubbish, say Asians

Dr Jafer Qureshi said toleration of sex-selective abortion would lead to the slippery slope of 'designer babies' 

The UK’s major Asian faith groups were last night united in condemning the union’s abortion warning.

Muslim, Sikh and Hindu representatives all gave their full support for gender-selective abortions to be criminalised.

And they attacked the TUC’s suggestion that it should not be outlawed because of ‘complexities’ to do with cultural issues as ‘ridiculous rubbish’.

Dr Majid Katme of the Islamic Medical Association said: ‘The claim that the amendment is divisive is ridiculous. It’s rubbish.

‘No-one will accept that. How will this divide communities? This is upsetting only the pro-choice people, that’s all.’

He added: ‘All the major faith groups in the UK are strongly united against this criminal act of killing girls in abortion.

‘Why in a civilised society do you target girls to be killed? Why are we going the way of India and China in targeting girls?’

Bal Sandhu, of the Sikh Council UK, agreed and described the TUC’s opposition to the ban as ‘outrageous’. 

She said: ‘They shouldn’t be saying that. I am absolutely shocked. This is completely out of the TUC’s remit. It is very offensive.’

In response to the claim that there might be ‘cultural’ reasons for allowing a gender-specific abortion, she said: ‘It is appalling that they can make such generalised statements, that they can say something like that. We are in support of sex-selective abortions being a criminal offence because it will act as a deterrent and people might think twice.

‘It doesn’t mean that there will be wife- battering as a result. It will simply send out a clear message that sex-selective abortions are illegal, unacceptable and will not be tolerated in this country.’

Dr Jafer Qureshi, Muslim co-chairman of the Medical Ethics Alliance, said: ‘Toleration of sex-selective abortion would put Britain on the slippery slope to designer families.

‘Islamic teaching is very clear on this – it is not allowed, period. I am extremely worried about this being abused.’

Hindu leaders also spoke out against the practice, saying they had been campaigning on the issue for years.

In a letter on the Bruce amendment, members of the Hindu Council UK and National Council of Hindu Temples UK wrote: ‘We are all united in the belief that sex-selective abortion must end. We were campaigning for this long before Fiona Bruce or anyone else became interested.’
