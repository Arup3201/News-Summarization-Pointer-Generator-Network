A former homeless woman's attempt to pull a 15,000lb truck failed today but still raised thousands of dollars for women in poverty.

Lia Grimanis, from Toronto, appeared on the Today show to try to pull the massive truck through Rockefeller Plaza in three-inch high heels - and in the process, a few expletives slipped from her lips live on-air.

Ms Grimanis was aiming to set the Guinness World Record for the 'heaviest vehicle pulled in high heels by a female' by dragging it for 16 feet and 4 inches (or 5 meters).

Pull! The 42-year-old failed in her world record attempt on Monday but still managed to raise thousands of dollars for charity

The world record hopeful gave herself the extra challenge by trying to pull the 15,000lb truck uphill in three-inch heels from Aldo 

After checking that the truck was in 
neutral and with the Today show presenters lined up to cheer her on, Ms 
Grimanis began her attempt.

However, although the wheels of the truck rolled forward a little, she was beaten by the slight gradient of the plaza.

The
 42-year-old grimaced in pain and slid back and forth in her Aldo heels 
with the truck harnessed to her back and holding on to a tow rope.

After trying for several minutes and exclaiming 's***' a few times live on-air, Ms Grimanis shook her head and gave up the challenge.

However despite the failed challenge, Walmart announced that they 
would keep their promise to donate $25,000 to New York charity Women In Need which helps homeless women get 
back on their feet.

Ms Grimanis told Today that
 she first realized that she was able to pull heavy loads when she got a job as a rickshaw 
driver. She said that pulling up to eight people in the back of a rickshaw showed her how strong she could be.

The 42-year-old, who was a formerly homeless high-school dropout, has become a successful  businesswoman in her native Canada.

She runs a non-profit organization Up With Women which provides housing and employment opportunities for women trying to get out of poverty.

Ms Grimanis' truck-pulling feats are part of her fundraising efforts. In December, she broke the  Guinness World record for the 'Heaviest Vehicle Pulled 100ft By A Woman' by dragging a 17,000lb transport truck.

At the time of her record, she said: 'As a survivor of homelessness and violence in the home, I wanted to show women who are struggling that anything is possible, and that we are all stronger than we think we are.'
