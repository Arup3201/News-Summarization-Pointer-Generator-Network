An explosive new coroner's report reveals Hollywood star Natalie Wood sustained bruises to her face and other parts of her body on her yacht before she went overboard and drowned in 1981.

The new development suggests that foul play could have been involved in Woods' death and that she didn't accidentally fall overboard on her 60-foot yacht - as the original police investigation concluded.

The new coroner's examination asserts that bruises found on the actress' face, wrists, knees, and ankles occurred before she went into the water - not, as the 1981 report concluded, as she struggled to climb back aboard the yacht after falling over the side.

Those bruises could have been 'non-accidental,' the medical examiner postulated.

Party: Ms Wood, Mr Wagner and actor Christopher Walken were aboard the boat - along with captain Dennis Davern (right) when she disappeared and drowned

Beaten: Ms Wood, seen here in 1962, had bruises on her wrists, knees and ankles that were consistent with her being beaten, according to a new coroner's report released in January

CBS News reports that the document pokes numerous holes in the original autopsy reporting and the ruling that her death was accidental - however it stops short of calling her death a homicide.

The network also claims the Los Angeles County Coroner's new report indicates she was possibly assaulted aboard the yacht.

Wagner's publicist, Alan Nierob, told MailOnline he would not comment on the report.

Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives reopened their investigation in 2011 after the captain of the yacht claimed that Wood's husband, Robert Wagner, was with her right up until she went overboard.

Her death was ruled 'accidental' at the time, but in 2012, the coroner changed the ruling to 'undetermined.' The coroner's office says in the new report that there is not enough evidence at this time to rule on the manner by which Wood died.

However, the report plays special attention to the bruises found on Wood's body.

'The location of the bruises, the multiplicity of the bruises, lack of head trauma, or facial bruising support bruising having occurred prior to entry in the water,' the report states.

Fatal: This is the yacht Splendor that Ms Wood and Mr Wagner were aboard when the actress went overboard and drowned off Santa Catalina Island over Thanksgiving weekend in 1981

Dangerous: Ms Wood reportedly could not swim. Her body was found floating in the water near Catalina Island hours after she went overboard

Tragic: New information released in the last couple of years has cast suspicion on the original finding that Ms Wood's death was accidental (pictured here with Mr Wagner)

Confession: Dennis Davern, the skipper of the yacht, says he lied to police about what happened the night Wood drowned

'Since there are unanswered questions
 and limited additional evidence available for evaluation, it is opined 
by this Medical Examiner that the manner of death should be left as 
undetermined,' Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran 
wrote in the report completed in June.

Wagner has told investigators that 
Wood, who could not swim, must have fallen in the water when she got up 
to try to retie a dingy that had been knocking against the side of the 
yacht.

He is not considered a suspect by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office.

Wood's body was found to have a blood
 alcohol content of 0.14 percent, nearly twice the legal limit for 
driving. She was also found to be under the influence of a motion 
sickness medication and a painkiller, which likely increased her level 
of intoxication.

Her body was found floating off Catalina Island, near Los Angeles, several hours later.

The
 captain of the yacht, Dennis Davern, claimed that a fight had broken 
out between Wagner and actor Christopher Walken, who was also aboard to 
yacht.

He said that after Wood went to bed, he heard the fight continuing in her cabin, including sounds of a physical struggle.

Mr Davern claims Wagner waited several hours after his wife disappeared to call authorities.

Wood, 43, burst into child stardom in 1947 playing little Susie, the girl who didn't believe in Santa Claus, in 'Miracle on 34th Street.' Wood later starred as Maria in 1961's 'West Side Story' and was nominated for an Oscar for her role opposite James Dean in 'Rebel Without a Cause.'

Wagner, now 82, admitted he had a fight with his wife on the night of November 28, 1981, but said she was not in her cabin when he went to bed.

He maintains he had nothing to do with her death, though said he feels personally responsible for not looking after her.

However, Davern reportedly offered an alternate explanation for Wood's death. Lana Wood, the actress' young sister, claimed to author Suzanne Finstad that Davern called her and drunkenly confessed that Wagner allowed his wife to drown.

'He said it appeared to him as though (Wagner) shoved her away and she went overboard. Dennis panicked and (Wagner) said, "Leave her there. Teach her a lesson." Dennis said he was very panicky that he was sitting and (Wagner) kept drinking and kept drinking.

‘And he’d say, "Come on, let’s get her." And he said (Wagner) was in such a foul mood, at that point, that he then shut up and was waiting for when, when are they gonna go to her rescue, until all the sound stopped,’ Lana is heard telling Finstad in recordings make for her 2001 book Natasha: The Biography of Natalie Wood.

Lana continues on to say that Davern did not think that Wagner meant for Wood to die but he did not ‘run to her aid.’

'Even if he did not kill her, which is what I understand the guy’s saying, it was – you know, that it – it was an accident,' Lana said.

The setup: On November 28, 1981, the 60-foot yacht Splendor set out for Santa Catalina Island, a rocky island off the coast of California, 22 miles from Los Angeles. Aboard were Robert Wagner, Natalie Wood and the boat's skipper, Dennis Davern. The couple also brought Wood's newest costar, Christopher Walken, to celebrate their successful completion of filming for 'Brainstorm,' a science fiction thriller.

Wood, Wagner and Walken departed the yacht and rode a dingy to shore, where they had dinner at Harbor Reef Resultant on the island. Waitresses reported that all three Hollywood actors drank heavily - mostly champagne - and were rude and boisterous.

Witnesses say all three were very intoxicated about 10.15pm when they piloted the dingy back to the yacht, which was anchored offshore.

Exactly what happened after the three returned to the boat remains a mystery.

The tragedy: Wood's body was found floating in the water about a mile from the yacht about 8am on November 29 and the coroner determined that she had died of a combination of drowning and hypothermia.

Her blood alcohol level at the time was 
0.14percent - nearly twice the legal limit for driving. She also had 
motion sickness medication and painkillers in her system, which likely 
increased her level of intoxication.

The time of death is estimated at about midnight at on November 29.

'The fact that her stomach contained 500 cc of partially digested food material supports that opinion of that time of death being around midnight, especially given the information that dinner was consumed between 8 and 9pm,' according to the new report.

However, Wood was not reported missing until 1.30am - fully 90 minutes after she went overboard, according to an interview with the manager of the restaurant on shore.
