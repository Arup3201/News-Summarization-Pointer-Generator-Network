All NHS hospital patients should have one doctor taking overall charge of their care to help avoid another Mid Staffordshire fiasco, the man behind the report into the scandal said yesterday.

Robert Francis QC told a London conference that major failings which led to the preventable deaths at the trust of up to 1,200 patients from 2004 to 2009 could suggest ‘other Staffords’ in the NHS.

But he said if every patient in all hospitals has one doctor in overall charge of them, it would help make sure medical staff take more responsibility for their patients, reported the Daily Telegraph.

Concerns: Robert Francis QC told a London conference that major failings which led to the preventable deaths of up to 1,200 patients from 2004 to 2009 could suggest 'other Staffords' in the NHS

He is concerned hospitals are being too slow in raising standards following his report in February - and criticised the NHS for having a culture of waiting ‘for someone else to tell it what to do’.

Mr Francis told the International Forum on Quality and Safety in Healthcare at ExCel in east London that doctors and nurses must take direct responsibility for patients and should not tolerate poor care.

According to the Telegraph, he said: ‘I've been now to a lot of hospitals to visit patients (and) no-one ever seems to know who their doctor is, except in very exceptional cases, or who their nurse is.’

He added: ‘I think it's essential for the feeling of responsibility, that on a day by day basis the patient knows who is the person in overall charge of the case.’

Not again: Mr Francis's report warned that unless major changes were made to the NHS, the neglect and horrific treatment at Mid Staffordshire would be repeated

Mr Francis’s report suggested a culture of fear in the Health Service that was obsessed with targets to the detriment of patients.

It warned that unless major changes were made to the NHS, the neglect and horrific treatment at Mid Staffordshire would be repeated.

In his formal response to the Francis report, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt called the scandal ‘a betrayal of the worst kind’.

He said NHS staff would now have a legal ‘duty of candour’ to tell the truth about patient care to patients, families and the Government.
