A pub landlady has won a  landmark court case against the Premier League which could  bring more televised football to the public.

Fed up with paying a huge subscription fee to Sky to show matches, Karen Murphy instead bought games through a Greek satellite broadcaster for a much cheaper price.

The Premier League, which sold the right to broadcast games in this country exclusively to Sky and ESPN for  £1.8billion, took legal action claiming Mrs Murphy was in breach of copyright. She was fined £8,000 by a British court.

Victory: Landlady Karen Murphy won her legal battle at the European Court of Justice against the Premier League over the screening of games in her pub using a 'foreign' television decoder

But yesterday a European court backed
Mrs Murphy and said the Premier League’s stance was ‘contrary to EU 
law’ on the freedom of trade.

It means Sky and ESPN cannot hold 
pubs and fans to ransom with monthly subscription charges which are 
often as high as £12,000 a year.

Landlords could now be able to show 
all 380 Premier League games a season by buying decoder cards and 
subscriptions from TV companies based in other EU states for less than 
£2,000 a year.

The ruling does not offer much 
benefit to viewers at home at present because of the high cost of buying
a suitable satellite system to pick up the foreign stations.

Viewers would need a larger satellite
dish, which costs around £500, as well as the decoder box and card, 
which could be a further £1,500. A typical Sky subscription in the UK is
£480.

But market forces could see providers introducing cheaper systems to tap into the legal breakthrough.

The decision by the European Court of
Justice in Luxembourg could cost Sky more than £200million a year. The 
Premier League’s income from selling the TV rights to games could also 
be savaged, taking money from clubs and their multi-millionaire players.

Mrs Murphy, who runs The Red White 
and Blue pub in Portsmouth, initially clashed with Sky in 2005 when she 
was being charged £700 a month – £8,400 a year.

She found it was possible to make 
huge savings – and get 3pm Saturday kick-offs, which are not shown on 
Sky – by buying the matches via a Greek broadcaster for only £800 a 
year. This involved installing a TV satellite system and buying a 
decoder card from the Nova channel to unscramble the signals.

One reason the Premier League and Sky
refuse to show matches at 3pm on a Saturday is to encourage fans to 
attend matches rather than sitting in the pub or at home.

However, the judgment concluded: ‘The
Court of Justice holds that national legislation which prohibits the 
import, sale or use of foreign decoder cards is contrary to the freedom 
to provide services and cannot be justified either in light of the 
objective of protecting intellectual property rights or by the objective
of encouraging the public to attend football stadiums.’

The ruling could make it cheaper for pubs to show matches such as Sunday's clash between Tottenham and Arsenal

The ruling will now go back to the 
British High Court for final ratification. Mrs Murphy said: ‘If you as a
man on the street wanted to buy a car you could go to any garage and 
buy one. As a publican I could only go to a Sky garage and pay ten times
what you would expect to pay.

‘I fought this because I was angry. I
fought because it was an unjust thing and I don’t believe these  
corporate people should dictate how much I should pay for a system.

‘I’m thrilled. It’s taken quite a chunk of my life but I’m glad I took it on. It’s been like Karen versus Goliath.’

The British Beer & Pub 
Association welcomed the ruling, saying: ‘Perhaps now, football will 
become more affordable for pubs, as live sport is a key ingredient of a 
great pub for millions of customers.’

The Premier League said it would need time to study the judgment.
