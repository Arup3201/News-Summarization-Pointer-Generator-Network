It’s not what she choose as part of her bridal look on the day of her wedding to Prince Edward.

But yesterday, the Countess of Wessex looked on in wonder as a Pakistani artist gave her a pre-wedding henna tattoo.

Although her wedding day is fifteen years behind her, 49-year-old Sophie Wessex looked thrilled with the results of artist Humaira Rehrel’s bridal tattoo.

Henna tattoos involve staining the top layer of the skin, with the impermanent effect lasting for up to three weeks.

The reddish-brown colour, which is commonly applied to the hands and lower arms, is dark when first applied before gradually fading.

The Countess had the elaborate tattoo painted across the top of the hand and index finger as part of Heart and Soul in Edinburgh- an annual event that celebrates global religion.
