‘Where I come from,’ says the man standing between Amir Khan and his mega-fight with Floyd Mayweather, ‘it’s not good to be cocky.’

Where Devon Alexander comes from is St Louis, a 15-minute drive from the combustible town of Ferguson in which riots against white police killing unarmed black men have fanned out across America.

‘Where I come from,’ Alexander continues with cutting reference to growing up on the mean streets, ‘you don’t brag that you’re better than everyone. Because in our communities we believe nobody is better than anybody.’

Alexander has slammed Khan's arrogance ahead of their clash at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas

The 27-year-old American claimed that if Khan was really as good as he says he is he wouldn't need to brag

There is no doubting at whom the message is aimed.

But to make sure, Alexander drives it home: ‘I’ve not been around Khan much but I hear a lot about him. And what I hear - even from boxing fans in the UK - is that he’s arrogant. A lot of people hate him. That’s the feed back. Not cool.

‘If you’re as good as he says he is you don’t have to tell everyone. You don’t gloat. Because the cockier you are the harder you fall.’

The shrewd odds-makers in the Las Vegas casinos do not expect Khan to fall in the MGM Grand Garden on Saturday night.

They quote Bolton’s 28-year-old at 1-3 on, Alexander at 2-1 against.

As Alexander The Great held court in a luxury box overlooking the MGM sports book he jerked a thumb in the direction of the giant screens behind him and said: ‘The odds are not important. Any more than they would be important if they favoured me. They only matter to the gambler. And if you’re going to have a bet, put it on me.’

Alexander said even UK boxing fans were happy to admit that Bolton-born  Khan was a narcissist 

Oscar De La Hoya’s Golden Boy promotions, who represent both fighters, would reportedly prefer Khan to win

Nor does it concern him that for all Oscar De La Hoya’s unfailing respect for all fighting men, his Golden Boy promotion company want Khan to win.

Alexander says: ‘I sense the preference. But when I win it will not be an upset in my mind. And if it upsets their plans, hard luck.’

Clearly the design is for Khan not only to defeat his fellow former world champion but to do so in such spectacular style that the public will demand Mayweather finally gives him his shot at the really big time.

Alexander smiles at that notion and says: ‘He hasn’t done anything in our sport to deserve the big fight with Floyd. He’s had a lot gimmes in his career. Look at my resume – constant back to back fights against the best.’

The perceived wisdom here is that Khan’s lighting speed, light-footed movement and eradication of his old mistakes under new trainer Virgil Hunter will prevail.

To which Alexander responds thus:

‘Speed? I’m fast too.

‘Movement? I move a lot.

‘Mistakes? He still makes them.’

Alexander claimed his track record showed consistent bouts against the best opposition available

The St Louis-born fighter said he could match his British opponent both in terms of speed and movement 

Alexander insisted that whoever won between him and Khan deserves a shot at Floyd Mayweather Jnr

Alexander comes from the classically tough background of the black American fighter.

Where he comes from, to be precise, is Hyde Park. The one in London is more leafy and fashionable than the neighbourhood in St Louis, which is most commonly described as ‘down-trodden, rough, drug-riddled and gang-infested.’

He is the star graduate of the gritty gym in Ferguson at which his wise old trainer Kevin Cunningham offered boys an alternative to running with the street gangs.

Like Khan, Alexander turned professional at 17, albeit not with an Olympic medal to show for his fine amateur career.

Now he becomes the first professional Khan will have fought who is younger than himself. By two months.

Alexander, too, is excited to be topping the bill at the MGM Grand Garden ‘the Mecca of boxing.’ Unlike Khan, this will be his first appearance in Las Vegas.

Will the winner, no matter which of them, deserve to fight Mayweather?

‘Sure.’ he says. ‘Why not?’

He answers his own question and when he does so you can tell he senses that even if he is victorious he may not be granted that enriching gift: ‘Even after I beat Khan he may still be the one to get the call. Because he brings UK television money to the table.’

Young men who fight their way out of Riotstown USA never forget their economic reality.
