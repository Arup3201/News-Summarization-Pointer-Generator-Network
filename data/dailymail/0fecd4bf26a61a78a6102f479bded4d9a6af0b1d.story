The search lead to a seizure of almost 100kg of drugs.

Norephedrine is a stimulant commonly used to make amphetamines and other illicit drugs, police said.

Police have not released a street value of the drugs, however 1 kilogram of ketamine worth an estimated $20,000, making part of the the stash worth over $1.4 million.

RCMP officers from Toronto's airport detachment arrested three men at a business in the city on July 27 and charged them with importing a controlled substance, possession for the purpose of trafficking and conspiracy to commit an indictable offense.

Itolo Mallozzi, 57, of Dufferin County, Ont., remains in custody, while Kevin Gowanlock, 49, of Orillia, Ont., and Amritbal Gill, 35, of Brampton, Ont., were released on bail.

'Organized crime plays a major role in smuggling illegal drugs into Canada,' Inspector Dean DICKSON, Team Commander of the RCMPâ€™s Toronto Airport Detachment GTA Serious & Organized Crime section, said in a RCMP release about the seizure.

'The RCMP is determined to fight organized crime in order to provide safe homes and safe communities for all Canadians.

'The result of this investigation demonstrates how the RCMP and its partner agencies work effectively together to keep illegal drugs out of our communities.'

Pierre Provost, Acting Regional Director General for the CBSA, Quebec Region, said police had made intercepting drugs coming into the country a priority.

'Keeping illicit drugs out of our communities is a CBSA priority,' he said.

'Our officers use a multifaceted approach based on risk assessment, intelligence and advanced technologies to target illegal shipments.

'They also work closely with their national and international partners to prevent the trade of illegal drugs through international borders.'

The three suspects are scheduled to appear in court September 2.
