The sport of dog jumping originates from the dockyards of America during the 19th and 20th centuries.

It is said that while waiting for ships to dock the workers would bet on whose dog could jump the furthest from the dock side into the water.

But now the pastime has evolved into a major sport for dog owners across the Atlantic.
