Police were forced to smash the windows of a car to save the life of a dog locked inside on the hottest day of the year. 

Officers were called to Finsbury Park, in north London, where they found the pet inside the car but its owner was no-where to be seen.

Desperate for water, the dog was captured cowering in the footwell on the driver's side.

Police were forced to smash the windows of this car to free a dog found cowering beneath the wheel without any water on the hottest day of the year

Sgt Richard Berns posted a photograph of the car with its windows smashed on Twitter and wrote: 'This dog was left in this car on the hottest day of the year with no water or ventilation. It has both now.'

According to ITV, the car's owner did return and questioned why the windows had been smashed.

Officers said the owner was later spoken to and the RSPCA will be carrying out a home visit.

The incident happened on Friday when public health warnings were issued and temperatures in London reached 32 degrees.

Animals can sustain brain damage or even die from heatstroke in just 15 minutes if they are locked inside a hot car.

Beating the heat is extra tough for dogs because they can only cool themselves by panting and by sweating through their paw pads.

When it’s 22°C outside, the temperature inside a car can reach 47°C within 60 minutes.
