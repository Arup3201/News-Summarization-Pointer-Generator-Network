The wife of Swansea manager Garry Monk has reacted angrily after a letter was apparently hand delivered to the couple's family home criticising his performance at the Liberty Stadium.

Lexy Blackwell, who gave birth to twin boys in March, posted on Twitter on Wednesday afternoon claiming she had received the letter from a neighbour.

'Absolutely incensed a NEIGHBOUR has the audacity2hand deliver a letter moaning at Garry's handling of things/everything he's doing wrong,' she wrote.

Garry Monk was furious that referee Michael Oliver awarded Stoke a penalty on October 19

'If u want2talk2him go2the Swans.Don't come2my childrens home. Or better still,as u think u know better than him,y don't u bcome a manager.'

The incident came the day after the Swans were knocked out of the Capital One Cup by Liverpool with Dejan Lovren scoring a late winner at Anfield.

Monk, who was handed his first managerial job when he took over at Swansea earlier this year after 10 years playing for the club, was named Barclays Premier League manager of the month for August and has guided the team to sixth in the table with 14 points from nine games.
