Eric Frein, the man who eluded police in the Pocono Mountains for seven weeks after shooting dead a trooper and wounding another, today headed to court for a preliminary hearing.

The 31-year-old self-taught 'survivalist' sported neatly combed hair and glasses as he arrived at a Pike County courthouse in Milford, Pennsylvania in handcuffs around 8am on Monday.

It came in stark difference to his appearance following his capture after a lengthy manhunt last year, when he sported a bloodied nose, bruised forehead, straggly hair and a mustache.

At his hearing on Monday, surveillance footage was played of the moment he allegedly shot dead Corporal Bryon Dickson and injured Trooper Alex Douglass outside their barracks on September 12.

It showed the mortally wounded trooper falling to the ground before Douglass kneeled at his side - before he too was shot. Douglass then crawled into the lobby on his stomach.

The video showed another trooper dragging Douglass into a secure part of the barracks and three troopers bringing Dickson inside.

Frein, who was shackled by his hands and feet, sat quiet and still through the morning session in the packed courtroom. At one point, he wrote a note and whispered into his attorney's ear.

At the hearing, a district judge must decide if there are sufficient grounds to send the case against him to county court.   

Frein was identified as a suspect shortly after the shootings when a passer-by found his vehicle partially submerged in a small pond near the state police station. 

Authorities launched a massive manhunt for Frein, an expert marksman, across the rural area - blocking roads and terrifying residents.

At the hearing, Trooper Sean Doran, an evidence technician, testified that he found Frein's checkbook and two explosive devices in a backpack at a wooded campsite near Canadensis. 

Troopers also found three crumpled, wet pieces of notebook paper in a garbage bag at the campsite that authorities say bore Frein's handwriting and described the ambush in detail.

'Got a shot around 11 p.m. and took it,' one entry said. 'He was still and quiet.'

After weeks of possible sightings, a team of federal marshals performing a systematic search stumbled across him at an abandoned airplane hangar about 30 miles from the scene of the shooting and were able to arrest him on October 30. 

John Schaaf, a deputy with the US Marshals Service, described how he was with two other deputies found at the abandoned airfield when another marshal first spotted Frein, ordered him to put his hands up, and asked him his name.

Frein got onto his knees and told them who he was. Schaaf said he handcuffed Frein and searched him, finding a pocketknife but no other weapons.

He said he also spotted a green nylon cord attached to 'different metal devices.' 

'I immediately thought he had explosives on him,' Schaaf said. But it turned out to be Frein's suspenders. 

He said Frein said, 'Can I tell you where the guns are in the hangar?' adding, 'I don't want a kid to find the guns.' He said that two rifles were upstairs in the hangar and a loaded pistol was downstairs.

Frein was shackled with Dickson's handcuffs and driven to the police station in Dickson's squad car.  

Authorities said Frein confessed to what he described as an assassination designed to 'wake people up' and result in a change in government.  

He faces charges of terrorism, murder and attempted murder. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.

The lengthy hunt for Frein is believed to have cost authorities as much as $11 million.

On the mend: Trooper Douglass (pictured center with his brother, right) left a rehab center so that he could spend Christmas with his family. He was shot in the pelvis in the September attack

Trooper Alex Douglass, who was shot in the pelvis by Frein outside the Blooming Grove barracks, left a rehabilitation center to spend Christmas with family in Lackawanna County.

At the time of his release, Lieutenant Chris Paris said Douglass is in good spirits but has a long way to go with his rehabilitation in New York.

His brother posted a message on his behalf on December 20, with a picture of them together beside a Christmas tree. Douglass was pictured grinning while using crutches to stand.

'Thank you all so much for your love, well wishes, and support!' his message read. ' I have seen all of your posts and truly appreciate how many of you care about me. Happy holidays!'
