She's the rock star wife and lingerie model famed for showing off her spectacularly toned body on the Victoria's Secret catwalk.

But Californian-born Lily Aldridge strikes a very different pose in a new set of pictures for British Tatler magazine.

The 'Angel', 27, covers up for once in for the sophisticated photo shoot as she wears designer shirts with the precious jewels.

White-gold & diamond ring, POA, by Cartier. White-gold & diamond necklace, POA, by De Beers. Platinum & diamond bracelet, POA by Harry Winston. Silk shirt, £796; wool shorts, £476; Leather belt, £138, all by Marc Jacobs

Wearing pieces from De Beers and Cartier, Lily, a mother-of-one, is pictured in one shot wearing tailored shorts and a silk shirt as with her hair styled in a choppy bob.

In another, the brunette beauty is 
seen relaxing against a white wall wearing a pillar-box red Valentino 
dress with square neck and an accordion pleat skirt.

She shows off sparkling jewels including a Tiffany bracelet worth £110,000.

Victoria's Secret recently revealed a glimpse into the details of its 2013 show, set to take place on Tuesday December 10.

The
2013 offering will star the lingerie giant's most famous Angels to 
date, including Adriana Lima, Alessandra Ambrosio, Candice Swanepoel - 
and Lily.

Lily Aldridge looks stunning and sophisticated for a jewellery shoot in this month's Tatler

The model and wife of Kings of Leon's
Caleb Followill looked svelte on the catwalk in November last year, despite 
having given birth to her first child Dixie less than five months previously.

And
ahead of walking in the show she wasn't concerned about anything, other
than what she would be tucking into once it was over.

Talking about body issues she has said: 'You know, I have a gap in my teeth and sometimes people take it 
away. But I'm like, "I love my teeth." You know, that's me.'

Her
words come just days after supermodel Gisele Bundchen slammed the 
photo-editing process after posing make-up-free for photographer Johan 
Lindeberg.

The mother-of-two told Fashionista.com: 'He said okay we have two hours, let’s just do it now–no hair, no makeup and really real...

'I
loved his approach because I feel like women should be really real and 
raw and it doesn’t really happen anymore [in fashion photographs].'
