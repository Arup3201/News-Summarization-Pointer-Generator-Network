Emmanuel Augustine, 29, was arrested on Wednesday morning north of Houston after approaching a female undercover officer and offering her $10 for a sex act

A police officer has been arrested in a prostitution sting by his own force.

Emmanuel Augustine, 29, has been a patrol officer with the Harris County Precinct 4 Constable's Office for five years.

But on Wednesday morning he was arrested after offering a female undercover officer $10 (Â£6) for 'a sex act'.

He was off duty at the time of the incident, but was still said to be wearing part of his uniform.

A spokesman for the constable's office said: 'Following his identification, the administration was notified and responded to the arrest location.

'[He] was placed on immediate administrative suspension without pay pending an investigation into the incident.'

For Augustine's safety, he was kept separate from other suspects while awaiting a probable cause court hearing late Wednesday.

Augustine is charged with soliciting prostitution which is a Class B misdemeanor.

If convicted of the charge, Augustine will face up to 180 days in jail and or a fine of up to $2,000 (Â£1,200).

It is not the first time an officer has been caught out by their own agency.

In April 2012 Santa Fe deputy Mike Esikant was apparently caught by the dash cam in his own squad car having a sexually explicit conversation with himself while masturbating.

In August 2013 Lieutenant Thomas Foye was arrested after he allegedly stole cocaine from a Ludlow Police evidence locker.

Foye, who had been with the department for 25 years, was ordered to hand over his badge and firearms, but has denied the charges.

Augustine, who has been a patrol deputy for five years, has been suspended without pay while an investigation is being carried out
