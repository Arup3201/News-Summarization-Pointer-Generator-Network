The Elf on the Shelf tradition brings joy to millions of children, but for one seven-year-old boy with autism it has helped open up a new world of possibilities.

Norrin Quinones-Fontanez's mother, Lisa, told MailOnline that she bought him a toy elf last year and quickly noticed how the daily game of hide-and-seek fostered his communication and imagination.

The 38-year-old New York-based writer and founder of the blog site Autism Wonderland continued: 'He liked it, especially after we read the story to him. He liked that "Elfie" was in a different place every day.'

Norrin's behavior also improved as he 'believed that Elfie was watching him' and if he stepped out of line Santa would know.

Yesterday, Ms Quinones-Fontanez  said she forgot to hide the red-clothed character and was surprised by her son's quick-witted reaction.

'When I forgot to move the toy Norrin 
noticed and moved it. Then he asked me to look for Elfie. I think he 
liked the idea of us switching roles.'

'Seeing Norrin excited about Elfie makes the few seconds of finding a new spot makes it worth it'

While she acknowledges that Elf on the Shelf is a nightmare for most parents, she says she's 'all for' anything that gets her son 'talking and engaging'.

Norrin was diagnosed with autism when he was two-and-a-half years old, at the time he had no speech or 'imaginative play skills'.

Ms Quinones-Fontanez said she had suspected long before that something was 'wrong.' 

In one of her regular blogs for 
Parents.com she recalls: 'Norrin was about 16 months old [and] I 
remember asking my husband - [but] he dismissed my concerns.

The holiday ritual enjoyed by families around the world was inspired by 2005 best-selling children's picture book The Elf on the Shelf: A Christmas Tradition

'Experienced mom friends told me I was just being a "new mom." My mother told me I was reading too many books. And my pediatrician suggested we wait and see.

'So that’s what I did. I waited. I listened to everyone else instead of going with my gut instinct.

'But I knew. I knew as soon as I took Norrin in for that fist evaluation. I knew when I started flipping through Norrin’s milestone calendar. It was practically empty.

'It brings a little of the holiday magic 
to us, rather than having to seek it out. It’s Christmas fun in the 
comfort of our home'

'I wasn’t too busy to fill it out, he hadn’t met most of the milestones of a typically developing child. I knew - before the doctor even diagnosed him - that Norrin had autism.'

Occupational therapy has helped him to develop communication and social skills and he currently attends a special education school for children with autism.

Ms Quinones-Fontanez says at home, playing video games and building with Lego blocks have also proved effective in reducing symptoms.

Returning to the subject of Elf on the Shelf, she concludes on Parents.com: 'I’ve read so many negative things about [the ritual]: it’ a waste of time, it’s creepy.

'To me it’s just fun. [It's] our holiday thing. It brings a little of the holiday magic to us, rather than having to seek it out. It’s Christmas fun in the comfort of our home.
