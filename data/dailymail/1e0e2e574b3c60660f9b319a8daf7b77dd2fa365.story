Adam Hathaway, 22, admitted breaching a sexual offences prevention order which was handed to him in 2011 following a string of sex assaults on girls

A convicted paedophile posed as a talent scout to lure children to fake auditions for West End show Matilda and secured a job at a top London theatre to be nearer to kids, a court heard.

Adam Hathaway, 22, who was jailed for three years in 2011 for sexually assaulting young girls, invited children to a dance studio for 'fake auditions' despite being prohibited from being in contact with anyone under the age of 18.

He also got a front of house job at the Phoenix Theatre on Charing Cross Road, London, and would greet youngsters as they arrived for rehearsals despite being the subject of the ten year sexual offences prevention order which prohibits him from contact with children.

The prolific paedophile pleaded guilty to two counts of breaching the order, which was imposed in May 2011, at Southwark Crown Court yesterday.

The court heard how Hathaway, who is also known as Adam Barraclough, was first convicted of sexually assaulting young girls in 2011 after setting up bogus photo shoots.

He claimed he worked for a fake company called Jungle International and used a string of aliases to fool modelling agencies into sending him children for shoots in Manchester, London and Bolton.

He then assaulted the youngsters while pretending to take their body measurements.

Hathaway was jailed for 10 months for the offences to run concurrent to a three year sentence imposed at the same time for sexual attacks on two girls, then aged seven and eight, in North Yorkshire. 

He also made the subject of the ten year sexual offences prevention order at Manchester Crown Court.

However, a year later he breached the order after being caught travelling in a car with a woman and her 20-month-old son. 

Despite not being allowed near children, Hathaway – who was at that time known as Adam Bentley – told the woman he was a professional dancer and she had no idea about his past criminal behaviour.

The truth was revealed after the car was involved in a crash and police arrested Hathaway for breaching the order. He was jailed for a further 12 months for being in close proximity to the baby.

Today, he appeared at Southwark Crown Court charged with four further breaches of the order.

Prosecutor Peter Zinner said: 'Your honour knows that Mr Hathaway is a convicted sex offender. 

Hathaway got a front of house job at the Phoenix Theatre on Charing Cross Road in London and greeted children as they arrived for rehearsals. He was found guilty of breaching the order by being in contact with kids

'In relation to count one, the prosecution's case is that he rather audaciously held auditions at a dance studio.'

The court heard how Hathaway invited young girls to the premises, including one of around nine years old, with the promise of appearing on stage in the highly acclaimed musical.

2009: Conned aviation bosses into thinking he was an airline tycoon whose company had a £4.5billion turnover and owned high street chains such as Next and Topshop.

2011: Jailed for three years for sexually assaulting two young girls, aged seven and eight, in North Yorkshire. Also jailed for 10 months, to run concurrently, for sexually assaulting young girls after luring them to bogus photo shoots in London, Manchester and Bolton. Handed a ten-year sexual offences prevention order (SOPO) by Manchester Crown Court.

2012: Convicted of breaching SOPO - which prohibits him from having contact with children - after being caught travelling in a car with a woman and 20-month-old child. He was jailed for an additional 12 months.

November 2014: Pleads guilty to two further counts of breaching SOPO after luring children to fake auditons for Matilda and getting front of house job at London's Phoenix Theatre where he was in regular contact with young children. Also pleads not guilty at Southwark Crown Court to two counts of breaching the SOPO, in relation to owning a mobile phone which can store video. Police found no indecent images on phone and judge accepts pleas, ordering them to lie on file.

Mr Zinner added: 'Again, the Crown say rather audacious behaviour in bearing in mind Mr Hathaway, or his other identity as Mr Adam Barraclough, obtained employment at the Phoenix Theatre.

'That employment was as an operations person who, during the course of his employment as a front of house performer, would have come into contact regularly with young children who were attending various musical adaptations.'

Hathaway pleaded guilty to those two charges but denied two others which the judge accepted.

The two he pleaded not guilty to related to the unauthorised ownership of a mobile phone which had the capacity to store videos.

Forensic analysis revealed there were no indecent images of children on the phone and the charges were ordered to lie on file after the prosecution accepted his guilty pleas for the more serious 'contact' offences.

It is understood he will be sentenced on November 24 when he appears at York Crown Court for a mention hearing after he admitted further breaches of the order.

Hathaway first hit the headlines five years ago when he was convicted of tricking aviation bosses into thinking he was an airline tycoon.

In an escapade likened to the plot of Hollywood Blockbuster 'Catch Me if you Can,' the then 17-year-old boasted his company had a £4.5billion turnover and owned chains such as Next and Topshop.

He created fictitious fellow executives of his 'airline' and set up fake websites before he was stopped by police while trying to board a plane in Southend, Essex.
