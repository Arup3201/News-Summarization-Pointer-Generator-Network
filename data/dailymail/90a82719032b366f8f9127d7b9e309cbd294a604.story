Robots are increasingly being used for manufacturing and in medicine.

But a new study claims that surgeries performed by robots are no more successful than relying on a human surgeon using traditional instruments.

In addition this, the research has found that robotic surgeons are considerably more expensive too.

But a new study claims that surgeries performed with the aid of robots (pictured) are no more successful than relying solely on a human surgeon using traditional instruments - but they are more expensive

Researchers examined robotic and traditional surgery methods in performing colectomies – surgical procedures that remove areas of the large intestine.

The study, by Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, found that robots could not outperform humans when it came to complications and mortality rates as well as the length of time patients took to recover in hospital.

However, the research, which was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, (JAMA) claims that surgical procedures using robots cost on average $3,000 (£1,836) more those that do not.

The scientists looked at 244,129 colectomies performed during 2008 to 2010 on patients over the age of 21.

Previous evidence has shown using these robots, rather than surgeon's hands, results in less blood loss, reduced risk of blood transfusion and a shorter overall recovery time

A previous study by the University of 
Columbia, published in the same journal, found there were no benefits to
 robotic surgery when it came to hysterectomies, iO9 reported.

The study, which compared the results of 
robotic and human surgeries, found that the robotic operations were more
 expensive and cost an extra $2,100 (£1,285) per procedure.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is currently investigating the safety of robotic surgery and the manufacturers of a robot widely used in keyhole surgery, admitted its arms could stall and seize up while performing delicate operations.

Intuitive Surgical has put out an ‘urgent medical device recall’ for the robotic arms of its da Vinci Surgical System, which is used to treat cancer and has been credited with reducing the side-effects of surgery.

There have been reported problems with the system, including several disturbing incidents including a robotic hand that wouldn't let go of tissue grasped during surgery and a robotic arm hitting a patient in the face as she lay on the operating table.

These accidents - and even several deaths linked to the system - have led to investigation.

The problem could affect 1,386 robotic arms in use across the world, according to the FDA.

A statement on the company’s website said stalling in the robotic arms of the system could result in a sudden ‘catch up’ if a surgeon perseveres with a move, despite slight resistance from the machine.

The da Vinci has four spider like arms, controlled by the surgeon, which hold cutting instruments to make tiny incisions and remove cancerous tissue part using images from a telescope to guide the surgeon.

The da Vinci has four spider-like arms, controlled by the surgeon, which each hold cutting instruments to make tiny incisions. The hands can then remove unwanted growths and organs, depending on the operation being carried out. It also features a tiny telescope which is placed inside an incision in the patient's body

The telescope takes images from two points, which are relayed back to a console so the surgeon has a 3D image on-screen while he operates.

Previous evidence has shown that using these robots mean significantly less blood loss, reduced risk of blood transfusion and probably a shorter overall recovery time.

For surgeons, who control the robot while sitting at a computer screen rather than standing over the patient, these operations can be less tiring - and robotic hands don't shake.

A 2002 study in the journal European Urology found prostate cancer surgery done by da Vinci robots had better outcomes for continence and cancer control than keyhole approaches done by the human hand.
