A mother has defied odds of more than 130,000-to-one to give birth to her second Christmas Day baby.

Hamima Juma, 24, welcomed her eldest daughter Maheera into the world on December 25, 2009, but was stunned when her little sister arrived exactly three years later.

Against the odds: Hamima Juma with her daughters, who were born on Christmas Day exactly three year apart

The perfectly timed Christmas presents both came later than expected for Hamima and her husband Maruf - having originally shared the same due date of December 19.

Maheera, was born at 9.05am and weighed 5lbs 12oz, while the couple's latest arrival, who they have not yet named, weighed 5lbs 11oz and was born at 10.30pm.

The proud mother, who gave birth to both girls at Coventry's University Hospital, said yesterday: 'I used to joke with my friends that this baby would come early on Christmas Day again.

'But that was only supposed to be a joke. It shows that nobody knows what is going to happen.

'Once I went into labour my husband was willing the birth to be before 12 o'clock.

'Maheera
is quite excited - she can't wait to see her. I'm not sure what the 
chances are but it's quite a remarkable coincidence.'

Hamima and Maruf, 33, were in the middle of celebrating Maheera's third birthday at the family's home in Coventry when the contractions began.

Maruf, a chef, added: 'We had my sister who is a student midwife on stand-by because we knew what happened a couple of Christmases before.

'So when she went into labour we were in safe hands to start with and we got Hamima straight to the hospital.

'I was praying for another Christmas baby - it's brilliant. Next year will be mad now, we'll have two birthday parties and a Christmas party to organise.

'Phenomenal': Mrs Juma defied odds of more than 130,000-to-one to have second baby on Christmas Day

'But we wouldn't want it any other way - we've had a couple of Christmas miracles there and we feel truly blessed.'

Bookmaker James Desmond said the odds of the two births both coming on Christmas Day were 'phenomenal'.

He said: 'It is a long shot to have a baby on Christmas day, a one in 365 chance, but to have two born on Christmas day years apart puts the odds up to a phenomenal level.

'We would give you 133,225-1 chance of this happening if you came to put a bet on with us.'
