A single mother on  benefits funded her family’s entire Christmas by taking out eight payday loans.

Katie
 McGill, 28, borrowed around £1,700 from companies including the 
controversial Wonga so she could treat her two children to a 
traditional meal and expensive presents.

It meant Mya-Renee, three, 
and Calvin, eight, were each able to unwrap a new bike, a new TV and a 
DVD player, as well as numerous computer games.

But now the 
celebrations are over, their mother is saddled with more than £3,000 of 
debt – with only her benefits to use to pay it back.

Miss McGill, 
from Devizes in Wiltshire, started borrowing in the months leading up to
 Christmas to pay for this year’s festivities.

She ended up taking out eight of the controversial loans – which critics say charge sky-high rates – from various lenders.

Now,
 she says the only way she will be able to pay them back is by using the
 £140 of her fortnightly benefits that doesn’t already leave her account
 through direct debits for various expenses.

Miss McGill said: ‘Each 
time I’ve borrowed money I’ve started borrowing more and more and now I 
have ended up with £3,000 worth of debt.

'I started thinking about 
Christmas a couple of months ago and thought that the only way I’d be 
able to get my kids the presents they wanted was by borrowing the money.

‘There were hundreds of presents under the tree. Their gran passed away this year so it was nice to be able to treat them.’

The
 single mother has now criticised Wonga and the other firms for giving 
her the loans without properly looking into her circumstances.

She said:
 ‘It’s stupid really because I’m on benefits and there is no way I can 
afford to pay it all back.’

Miss McGill said that when she first 
started using payday lenders, back in 2009, she was in a stable 
relationship and she and her partner both had jobs.

This meant she was 
able to pay off the loans.

‘But now I am on my own and unemployed,’ 
she said. ‘Wonga haven’t looked into my change of circumstances though, 
and they’re still allowing me to borrow.’

Miss McGill – who has taken
 out pre-Christmas loans ranging from £80 to £380 – will need to start 
paying them back next Thursday.

Lavish Christmas: The mother-of-two was able to buy her children 'hundreds' of gifts with the £1,700 she received from the eight companies

Struggle: The single mother, who is on benefits, claims she will not be able to buy basic necessities when she starts making the repayments

But she says she won’t be able to afford it and fears she will simply end up borrowing more.

‘When
 I start paying back the loans I won’t be able to pay the bills or buy 
food, drink and necessities. Then I’ll start taking out more loans and 
it will just be one big, messy, circle.’

A spokesman for Wonga said 
the company does not let people take out more than one loan at once.  
Borrowers have to pay each one off in full before becoming eligible to 
take out another.
