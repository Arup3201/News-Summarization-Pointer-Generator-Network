The Duke of Cambridge has spoken of his close bonds with fellow RAF search and rescue crewmates in a new documentary that shows him at work.

William described colleagues as 'family' and highlighted his responsibilities captaining rescue efforts during the BBC Wales series about the search and rescue service.

Interviewed for the four-part series Flight Lieutenant William Wales, as the royal is known in the RAF, said: 'In this job if you have friends and you have guys you get on with, you've got to have some fun, you've got to have some laughs.

At the controls: William flies with three colleagues - a winchman and paramedic, co-pilot and winch operator - whom he describes as his 'family'

'At the end of the day you're operating sometimes in some really dodgy and quite dangerous conditions, you have to rely on each other quite a lot and so getting to know each other, being a family is all part of that.'

William flies with three colleagues - a winchman and paramedic, co-pilot and winch operator - but the individuals can change from shift to shift.

The first installment of the documentary series is screened next week and shows William flying a Sea King helicopter to rescue a 15-year-old boy who has fallen off a railway bridge onto some rocks in the Maenofferen slate quarry in the north Wales town of Blaenau Ffestiniog in Gwynedd.

The Duke and his crewmates are seen trying to pinpoint the casualty - who has damaged his ribs and is drifting in and out of consciousness - but are hampered by bright sunlight which throws dark shadows onto the ground.

The royal said: 'The weather was really good which makes searching a lot easier, having the sunshine out is great, but with the sunshine comes huge shadows as well and so if you're inside those shadows you can't be seen very easily.'

William is the first to spot the injured boy and he soon tells his colleagues and lands so the paramedic can assess the teenager.

But the helicopter is low on fuel and the royal flies off to refuel leaving behind winchman/paramedic Master Aircrewman Richard Taylor to look after the 15-year-old.

He is later airlifted to hospital when William returns and makes a full recovery.

The royal qualified as an operational search and rescue captain last year and works full-time - albeit with time off for royal duties - rescuing stranded climbers and stricken casualties.

William has been serving with C Flight, 22 Squadron at RAF Valley on Anglesey since 2010.

Speaking about the role of captain the Duke tells the documentary: 'You have to analyse all the information you're given and make the best judgment. It's not easy, it makes you feel worried, concerned, you obviously want to make the right call.

'I have a duty of care for the crew, for the casualty in many cases as well, so you do have to think very carefully. Overall I've got three other guys I can always rely on for my decision making.'Â
