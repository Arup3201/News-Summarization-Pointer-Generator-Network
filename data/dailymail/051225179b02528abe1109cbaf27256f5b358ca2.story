A man has been accused of raping a string of animals including cows, horses and even water buffalo in the Philippines.

Andy Loyola was arrested after he was allegedly caught having sex with a cow which had been reported missing by its owner in Silang, near Manila.

The farmer, Rustico Sarno, later claimed the animal had become pregnant  despite insisting it had never mated with a bull.
