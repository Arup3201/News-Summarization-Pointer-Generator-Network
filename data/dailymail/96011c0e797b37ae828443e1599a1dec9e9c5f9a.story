A Navy warship might seem an unlikely place for a ballerina to practice her pirouettes and plies.

But that is exactly what happened on board HMS Ocean after Officer of the Watch - and talented dancer - Lieutenant Anna Sanocki won a place at a prestigious U.S. ballet school.

The 30-year-old naval officer's superiors granted her special permission to attend a two week summer programme at Boston Ballet School - and she used an impromptu dance studio set up on Britain's biggest warship to prepare for her 'once-in-a-lifetime opportunity'.

Talented: Officer of the Watch Anna Sanocki was one of only 25 people picked for the summer programme at the prestigious Boston Ballet School in the U.S.

Lt Sanocki, from Plymouth in Devon, has served around the world on board the assault ship, but she kept up her dancing at the same time after falling in love with ballet at university.

She was one of only 25 dancers picked for the school's summer programme on the back of her ten years experience as an amateur ballerina.

'There are a lot more ballet schools in America than there are in the UK, and it's much more common for adults to do ballet over there,' said the naval officer, who trained under some of the world's best instructors during her sojourn at the Boston Ballet School.

'Boston has always been on my list of places to visit, so I got to kill two birds with one stone.'

Lt Sanocki said she had been hesitant
about applying for the scheme at first, because it clashed with the 
London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. HMS Ocean is currently moored 
on the River Thames at Greenwich as part of the security operation 
surrounding the event.

But the ship's commanding officer, Captain Andrew Betton, encouraged her application.

'Initially I was a bit nervous about 
bringing it up, because I knew about our tasking for the Olympics and 
Paralympics and how busy we were likely to be.

'But when I spoke to him about it, the captain was really supportive of the idea.

'He told me I had to go, that it was a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and that he was sure they could get 
around my absence somehow.'

Lt Sanocki's crew mates even helped her by turning a spare compartment on the ship into an impromptu dance studio.

'Some of the crew bring bikes and golf clubs on board. I just bring a barre instead,' she explained.

'Lots of people think ballet is easy, that it 
isn’t exercise, but it is,' the officer said.

'It’s
a very different kind of fitness and it’s all about making it look easy
and graceful when you’re actually working really hard.

'It’s a pretty weird hobby for a naval officer to have.

'But
it makes me happy so I don’t mind. When you’re focusing so intently on 
every movement, the rest of the world just disappears into the 
background. It’s very cathartic.'

Lt
Sanocki has returned from Boston and is now working as professional 
crew on board a P2000, a small fast training boat which provides 
university Royal Navy units with their own sea going training vessels.
