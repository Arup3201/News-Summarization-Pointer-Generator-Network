They aren't exactly two peas in a pod, but Brian May and Sir Patrick Moore shared a bond in science — and were so close that the guitarist even bought Sir Patrick's house to make sure he could live there for the rest of his life. 

Brian bought Farthings, the house in Selsey, West Sussex for £480,000 in 2008, paying about £40,000 above the market value to ensue the astronomer could stay in the home he had lived in for four decades.

Sir Patrick Moore died peacefully at his home last week, aged 89.

According to The Sunday Times, Brian leased the property back to Moore on the same day he bought it — charging 'one peppercorn if demanded' for a 25-year lease.

However, the Queen guitarist is furious about the Sunday Times' report and has released an angry statement on his website.

It reads: 'Sir Patrick Moore is not even laid to rest yet, but I have just heard that The Sunday Times (yes, them again) have been sneaking around, like the carrion eaters they are, and are now about to "reveal" all the details they've managed to sniff out about how we, as Patrick's friends, helped him in his latter years, to stay functional in his own home to the very end.

'I'm actually amazed and quite disgusted that these press people are so intrusive and nosy.

'Is there no respect at all?

'These matters were private, between friends. What motivates these grubby little people to go snooping around?'

Music of the spheres: Sir Patrick Moore was a keen xylophone player

In a statement to The Guardian, May said it was too soon to decide the future of the house, but hinted it's myriad scientific treasures could be opened up for the public to see.

He said: 'It's too early to be able to comment meaningfully on this. As Patrick's friends, we have been discussing possible futures for some time, but until now the first priority has always been safeguarding the quality of Patrick's life while he was alive.

'It will take time to assess what the possibilities now are.'

May, who has an estimate fortune of £90m, described Sir Patrick as a 'father figure' who inspired him to study for a PhD in astrophysics.

He had been a fan of the astronomer since childhood, when he begged his parents to let him stay up late to watch The Sky At Night, the show Sir Patrick presented for 55 years.

The two connected in person after working on a radio play together, and later co-authored the book Bang! The Complete History of the Universe.

They also shared a love of music – Sir Patrick was a self-taught xylophone player, and at Farthings he had one rule for guests: nobody was to touch the xylophone.

Moore also wrote more than 100 musical compositions, including a march in praise of Halley’s Comet, and once listened to a Viennese waltz on his car radio before realising he had written it.

The astronomer was a well-known socialite, and often hosted parties at Selsey with Brian and his wife Anita Dobson.

Sir Patrick bough Farthings for £4,000 in cash in 1967. It was also home to his private observatory

In the event of his death, the astronomer was clear about what he wanted. He would not have a funeral, but a party – ‘Quite a show. Plenty of drink.’ His family and friends have vowed to do just that.

Sir Patrick bough Farthings for £4,000 in cash in 1967. Eventually, he had four observatories in his back garden and was devastated when they were damaged in a storm in 1998.

But the house was never financially secure. Neighbours said Sir Patrick instead spent his money on telescopes, annual New Year's Eve parties for the village and helping young astronomers through university.

Neighbour Eileen Nolan, 73, said: 'He never was aware how much money he had or how little he had. Quite often the accountant said, "No more spending this week, Patrick."

'Brian said if ever I saw him looking as though he was getting into trouble to give him a call. So I did. And he just turned up.'

In an obituary for the astronomer, Brian May wrote of his friend's generous nature: 'His dedication to young aspiring astronomers was legendary.

'He gave away any income he made to the point where he had no security himself except that which his friends supplied.'
