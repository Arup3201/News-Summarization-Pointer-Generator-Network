A former federal cyber-security expert who used his professional skills to hide his membership of a 'dark web' child pornography ring called PedoBook has been jailed for 25 years. 

Timothy DeFoggi, 56, of Germantown, Maryland, joined a Tor-based website which featured images of child sex abuse believing that his activity would be completely anonymous. 

However, federal investigators discovered DeFoggi, who was the former acting director of cyber-security at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, joined the Tor-network-based website on March 2, 2012 until the site was taken down by the FBI on December 8, 2012. 

According to court documents, DeFoggi wanted to meet up with a fellow PedoBook member to fulfil his fantasy of raping and murdering a small child.  

Five other members of the PedoBook network have been jailed for between 12 and 20 years after they pleaded guilty and in some cases testified against DeFoggi during his trial in August 2014. 

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Department's Criminal Division said: 'Using the same technological expertise he employed as Acting Director of Cyber Security at HHS, DeFoggi attempted to sexually exploit children and traffic in child pornography through an anonymous computer network of child predators.

'But dangerous criminals cannot be allowed to operate on-line with impunity. Today's sentence shows that the Department of Justice will bring criminals and child predators to justice, even when they employ anonymous networks like Tor.'

DeFoggi was found guilty on August 26, 2014 following a four day trial of 'engaging in a child exploitation exercise', which carried a minimum jail term of 20 years and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. 

According to the Government's sentencing memorandum: 'Trial evidence demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, acting through his online aliases "PT***eater" and "****christ" joined and participated actively in the Tor-network-based "PedoBook" online social networking community.

'During the course of his membership in that community the defendant repeatedly accessed child pornography depicting infant and toddler-aged children being raped by adults or engaging in other sexually explicit activity; joined public and private groups such as "Boys Hardcore," "Kids with dog & other animals," "Toddler Girls Forced" and "0-2 Year Little Girls Private Sharing Group 2012".' 

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell, left, said DeFoggi used the skills he had developed while working as a cyber-security expert with the Department of Health to try and avoid detection 

Federal prosecutors discovered that DeFoggi encouraged 'others to interact with him in order to further his particular interest in violent child pornography and child sexual abuse'. 

He also solicited child abuse images from fellow members and 'discussed his desires to commit the violent rape and murder of children; and south to meet at least one fellow member to share in and facilitate that desire.'

According to federal prosecutors the PedoBook social network routed all communication through several computers before reaching their final destination in a bid to prevent them being intercepted by the authorities. 

'The defendant deployed multiple software programs, including Eraser and CCleaner, to delete evidence of his computer and web browsing activity. And when finally confronted by law enforcement agents executing a search warrant in his home, he immediately ran for his laptop computer (which was in the process of downloading a child pornography video from a Tor-network-based child pornography archive) and had to be physically removed from it by an FBI agent.'  

US Attorney for the District of Nebraska Deborah R. Gilg said: 'Today's sentence and the others imposed earlier demonstrate that those who exploit children will be aggressively pursued and prosecuted to the full extent of the law

'Those who think they are acting anonymously on the Internet will be found and held accountable.'

FBI Special Agent in charge Thomas Metz said: 'The production and distribution of child pornography is one of the most saddening, tragic crimes the FBI investigates

'Today's sentencing sends a message to those who advertise, distribute, possess, and trade child pornography that the FBI will look for you, will find you and will make sure you are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.'

Timothy DeFoggi, 56, formerly of Germantown, Maryland, was convicted on Aug. 26, 2014, following a four-day jury trial before Chief U.S. District Judge Laurie Smith Camp in the District of Nebraska of engaging in a child exploitation enterprise, conspiracy to advertise and distribute child pornography and accessing a computer with intent to view child pornography.

The PedoBook network was run by a single administrator Aaron McGrath, who was jailed for 20 years on January 31, 2014. He received a 10-year reduction in his sentence for providing 'substantial' assistance ot the government. 

Jason Flanary, 43, formerly of Chicago, Illinois but living in the Philippines and Guam received a 20 year jail term in June 2013.

Wesley Cameron 23, of Ashford, Alabama was jailed for 15 years in October 2014. 

Charles MacMillan, 29, of Rockville, Maryland and Zackary Austin, 28, of Reno, Nevada received 12 and 16 years respectively, when they were jailed in November 2014.
