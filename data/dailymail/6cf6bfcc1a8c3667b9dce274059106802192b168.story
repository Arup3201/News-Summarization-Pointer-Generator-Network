There we were thinking this was an all-new Arsenal. Here was a match which, for much of it, appeared to build on that 2-0 away win at Manchester City in January. The renaissance Arsenal team seems solid, workmanlike and ready to hit teams on the counter.

With Mesut Ozil orchestrating, Olivier Giroud turning into a warrior-like centre forward who can hold the ball up superbly, and the speed and skill of Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck wide, they are perfectly equipped to play this type of game. And with Francis Coquelin’s importance growing with every game, there seemed to be a solidity about Arsenal which has rarely been evident in the past.

It is, however, something of a mirage, an illusion. They might appear more robust but their fragility seems to haunt them, hanging around like an un-exorcised spirit.

Arsenal were in control of this game. They were defending well. The clock was ticking on and three minutes of injury time had been play when Shola Ameobi met a corner at the far post. Amidst the confusion – a ricochet off Tomas Rosicky, a bounce off Per Mertesacker – Wilfried Zaha drove in shot which David Ospina parried and in snuck substitute Glenn Murray to prod home a goal.

Still, it was no more than a consolation. Barely enough time remained for Arsenal to kick off. Yet within the remaining 90 seconds, Arsenal demonstrated sufficient vulnerability to ruin their new image.

Yannick Bolasie went tearing down the left and swung in a cross. Ospina came diving out to punch away and missed the ball completely. At the far post lurked Murray waiting to head home. He met the ball cleanly and yet hit the post with the ball rebounding into the hands of the fortunate and relieved Ospina.

That last kick – or head – of the game should have seen Arsenal forfeit two points. And even though it didn’t, it was enough to suggest that old habits die hard.

If Arsenal have truly changed, then maybe they could yet enjoy a sustained run in the Champions League and approach an FA Cup tie at Old Trafford with confidence. The final two minutes on injury time yesterday suggested otherwise.

‘We can learn from every game and I believe the players know that they switched off a little bit early,’ said Arsene Wenger ruefully. ‘Certainly they thought it was done. In the Premier League it is never done. And when that header went off the post, we were a bit fortunate.’

Crystal Palace were doughty opponents yesterday. They absolutely make the most of what they have. The return of Mile Jedinak from winning the Asian Cup with Australia adds more fortitude to an already hard-working midfield. The pace of Dwight Gayle and Wilfried Zaha and later Bolasie was always a threat.

Olivier Giroud started and finished the move for Arsenal's second goal. The strike came from a lovely Alexis Sanchez pass to Danny Welbeck, whose shot was parried into the path of Giroud. For more stats, pitch maps and analysis see  our brilliant MATCH ZONE

‘That’s probably the best we’ve played since I’ve been manager,’ said Pardew. ‘The one that hit the post and goes in the keeper’s hands summed our day up really. I actually though the spin of the ball was going to take it into the net when it came off the post. It could have gone anywhere. It wasn’t to be. There was some great team play, some great individual moments and probably the best players were on our team, but we’ve lost.’

Arsenal were presented with an unexpected foothold in the game with a penalty on 8 minutes. Palace were aggrieved but perhaps only to spare the blushes of Pape Souare. Only last week Alan Pardew was warning that it would take the Senegalese left back time to adjust to the speed and intensity of the Premier League.

He was miles off the pace on seven minutes, mis-controlling the ball and then lunging at Danny Welbeck as the Arsenal player chased the ball down ruthlessly. Palace’s complaint was that initial contact occurred outside the box – though Souare planted his foot on the line of the penalty area and his leg appeared to follow through into the box as he felled Welbeck. 

‘It’s a mistake and he should better but the call is tough on us as it looked as if the incident happened outside the box,’ said Pardew. ‘he just got caught out and dwelled ion it and he’ll need to learn from that.’ Though it took several replays to ascertain the truth, on this occasion the instincts of the referee and his assistant were correct. Santi Cazorla took the spot kick, swept it confidently to his right and celebrated enthusiastically in front of the Palace fans.

Thereafter, Palace played rather well but it was turning into a scrappy, physical game with little direction until Arsenal extended their lead on 43 minutes. This time Palace had legitimate cause for complaint.

Giroud's goal came against the run of play, with Palace causing Arsenal plenty of problems without hitting the target in the first 45 minutes

Though the ball from Alexis Sanchez for Welbeck was utterly sublime, the effect was ruined somewhat by Welbeck starting his run a fraction early and ending up in an offside position - just – as the ball was played. He shot, Julian Speroni parried and Giroud, who has been superb holding the ball up in the build up, followed up from close range to score his 50th for the club.

‘The second goal is offside,’ said Pardew. ‘And that should be made that call. I had more problems with the second goal than the first. It’s just before half time and you have to get that call right.’

Palace were much brighter in the second half. Monreal was required to block a Zaha strike amidst a chaotic goal-mouth scramble. Souare showed his attacking qualities with a delightful cross which Gayle met and headed wide. Their efforts were ultimately in vain. But they came mightily close to exposing Arsenal.
