Wartime code-breakers - and lovebirds - Marion and James Peet were ordered to change their wedding plans to avoid clashing with D-Day.

Former Flight Sergeant James and Corporal Marion, now both 93, fell in love while stationed at top-secret code-breaking centre Bletchley Park, Bedfordshire, during the war. The pair intercepted and analysed secret German messages as part of the war effort.

The smitten couple used to send each other love notes in Morse code while they worked on the World War II Enigma project in 1942.

The couple from Wickam, near Portsmouth, met before D-Day at the code-breaking centre in Bedfordshire

Marion, from Wickham, Hampshire, said: 'We couldn't say anything to each other so I had to think of a way to talk to Jim. It was all mushy stuff.

'He used to be a very good dancer and he could sing and so could I - that's why we got on so well together.'

James, 93, said: 'I said in Morse code "I love you", and that she was smashing. She still is.

'We wanted to marry in June 1944, but we brought it forward to April because we were told all leave was to be cancelled for an unknown period.

'It was only afterwards we found out the reason why was because of D-Day.

'At the time we both were attached to Bletchley Park as she would take German messages in Morse code and I would analyse them.

'We were particularly hot on knowing anything that was going on.

'And we both had to sign the official King's Secrets Act and couldn't tell anybody what we did until 1980, not even our family.

'We didn't know much about D-Day we just carried on with our jobs and what we were doing, intercepting and analysing the German's messages.'

Marion and James, who have recently celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary, have three daughters, seven grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.

James added: 'We married at the local church in Campton in Bedfordshire and it was a nice day.'Our reception was held in the village hall and although it was in the days of rationing everyone chipped in.

'Some locals brought tomatoes, others lettuce and so on - we even had the air force band.

'It was a really lovely day.'
