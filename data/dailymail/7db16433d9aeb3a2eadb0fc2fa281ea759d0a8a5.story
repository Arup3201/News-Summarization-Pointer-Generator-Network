Police have released further details of the moments leading up to Oregon mother Jennifer Huston's disappearance, saying she visited a store to buy trail mix and sleeping pills.

The 38-year-old mother-of-two left her home in Dundee to run errands and never returned to her husband and their two sons, aged two and six. Her husband, Kallen Huston, reported her missing on Friday, July 25.

Officers investigating her disappearance obtained surveillance footage of her withdrawing money from a local bank before heading to a gas station, it was reported yesterday.

Police have now revealed Mrs Huston visited a Rite Aid after leaving the gas station.

Jennifer Huston, 38, vanished as she ran errands last Thursday. Police have now revealed she visited a Rite Aid where she bought a sports drink, trail mix and sleeping pills before her disappearance

She bought a Gatorade sports drink, trail mix and sleeping pills at the store, FoxNews has reported.

The
 amount of sleeping pills bought at the shop was not believed to have 
been enough to cause a fatal overdose, investigators told the website.

Mrs Huston was spotted on cameras alone at a credit union in Newburg at around 6pm last Thursday, The Oregonian reported earlier this week.

Ten
 minutes later, she was captured on cameras at a nearby 76 gas station. 
After buying gas, her dark green Lexus LX-470 was seen driving off with 
only her inside.

At the time police had said she had not used her credit cards since and her cell phone has been switched off.

Authorities have not said how much money she withdrew from the bank, only saying it was a small amount.

'Amazing woman': Mrs Huston's father, Bill, said that there were no conflicts at home, and that she would 'never leave her boys. She is an amazing mom and woman'

Police have now said her vehicle, with a full tank of fuel, could travel up to 350 miles, FoxNews has reported.

Mr Huston has said that his wife complained of headaches three days before disappearing, but she hadn't seen a doctor. At a press conference on Monday, he said he feared she'd crashed her car.

'I ask that anybody helping us, regardless of the area they are in, look off to the left and off to the side of the highways,' he said.

'See if you can tell if shrubs are 
disrupted, maybe small trees knocked down where it would appear as if a 
car had driven off or crashed. Her car is fairly large so it would make a
 pretty good hole... Look to see if maybe her car is tucked away behind a
 garage or something.

'I have the feeling she's in a ditch somewhere.'

He added: 'This is totally unlike her. She's a devoted mother. Sheâ€™s just a very good person, and for her to do something like this is completely out of the norm.'

Detectives have said Mr Huston has cooperated with them during the investigation and had passed a polygraph test, KPTV.com reported.

Her parents have also begged anyone who has any information as to her whereabouts to get in touch.

Her
 father, Bill Turner, said he and wife Deborah, were 'scared to death 
... absolutely scared to death' over the mystery of her disappearance.

'She's
 a bright, vibrant person. She's a loving mom,' Turner said. 'She looked
 like she could be a model. She's the person who everyone will gravitate
 to and will want to talk to.'

Speaking
 of his daughter's marriage, he added: 'The best way to describe the 
relationship, the way my wife describes it, is two old souls living 
together.'

Mrs Huston's mobile phone has been switched off since her disappearance on Thursday. Her family has created a Facebook page to share photographs and information

He added that there were no conflicts at home, and that she would 'never leave her boys. She is an amazing mom and woman.'

The
 family created a Facebook page, Find Jennifer Huston, to share 
photographs and information, sparking a massive social media campaign to
 find her under the Twitter hashtag #findjenniferhuston.

According to a family flier, Huston 
was last seen wearing black and pink Nike shoes and yoga pants. She is 
5-foot-7-inches tall and has blond shoulder-length hair and blue eyes.

Anybody with information that may lead to finding Mrs Huston are urged to call their local police station immediately.
