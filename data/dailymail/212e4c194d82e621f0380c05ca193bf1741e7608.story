A serial pot plant thief has been caught on camera ripping off plants in broad daylight from a garden.

The brazen woman was busted on security vision pulling up out the front of a home in Coburg, in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, and confidently strolling through the open gate before taking her pick from the front yard.   

Homeowner Paul Ditchello purchased a $400 CCTV system earlier this year after a number of plants and an antique shopping trolley vanished from his garden.

'I'd just watered them the previous evening and noticed one was missing,' Mr Ditchello told Channel 9 News.

'It's just not their property. What gives them the right to go into somebody's house and take their property as they wish?'

Mr Ditchello is hoping his footage of the woman caught in the act walking back to her Toyota and placing the plant on her lap before driving off will help find the green-thumbed culprit. 

Although it's a minor theft, police have taken a formal report.

'They said if they get that they will issue a warrant and rescue the pot plant,' Mr Ditchello said.

Police hope to identify the culprit from the car registration number on the Toyota
