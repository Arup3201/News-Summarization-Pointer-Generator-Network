The pontiff, however, did not seem too bothered by the interruption, and calmly smoothed down his clothes and rearranged his mantle.

At one point the skull cap was blown clear off his head as he delivered his message during his weekly general audience.

It is not the first time the leader of the Catholic church has been captured sans hat.

In December, a curious child removed the headwear and patted Pope Francis's head.

With a smile, he calmly replaced his hat.

It comes as it has been revealed he has penned a new missive on the injustices of poverty amid indications that he and his cardinal advisers are eyeing a major overhaul of the Vatican's financial house.

Before long, the cap is blown clear from his head as he continues the address

Honduran Cardinal Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga, a key adviser in Francis' Group of Eight cabinet, told the French Catholic newspaper La Croix that the idea of creating a 'finance secretariat' was not only necessary but reasonable to better organize the Vatican's diverse financial departments so they can better serve the church.

He said: 'A cardinal will probably be in charge of the finance secretariat, but one could also think about a permanent counsel to help him, including lay people.'

The development came as Francis ended his third and final day of meetings with his advisers on Wednesday.
