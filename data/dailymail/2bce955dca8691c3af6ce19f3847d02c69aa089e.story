A dart game that used President Obama's face for target practice at a county fair in New York state is being dismantled today.

Fairgoer Abigail Czapsky submitted photos of the booth at Otsego County Fair to HuffPost yesterday, which show President Obama's face lined up alongside yellow stars in a dart game.

According to Czapsky's Facebook page, following yesterday's HuffPost story the booth has now taken down the offensive targets.

Outrage: This is the target of President Obama used at a New York State fair over the weekend

Target: Fairgoers were offended by the use of an image of the President's face as a target in a fairground game

Czapsky says the Otsego County Fair Board called her to apologize about the booth and explain that it was being taken down.

'Not one
 individual on the fair board, apparently, took issue with the game in 
any review that was done before the actual opening of the midway,' writes Czapsky.

'The 
quote was they "just missed it" at the time but would now be taking it 
down.'

It is unclear what the prize was for fairgoers who managed a bulls-eye on Obama.

It's not the first time the President's face has been used for fairground amusements.

In 2010, a Pennsylvania amusement company was forced to dismantle a game in which players shot foam darts at a likeness of President Obama's face.

At the time company head Irvin Good, Jr, told Associated Press, 'It was just a big, big mistake in judgment, and I feel sorry about it. I can't take it back, but I can try to make it better.'

Kathryn Chapman, the fairgoer who complained about the game, dubbed Alien Attack and featuring a painted image of a black man wearing a belt buckle with the Presidential seal and holding a scroll labeled 'Health Bill', was offended by its inferences.

Players stood to win prizes such as stuffed animals by hitting targets on the image's head and heart.

'What is the message you are sending kids, that if your views don't agree with somebody else's, shoot them? I just found it incredibly disrespectful and violent,' Chapman told HuffPost.

'And this was the president, the highest office in the country. It was absolutely appalling.'
