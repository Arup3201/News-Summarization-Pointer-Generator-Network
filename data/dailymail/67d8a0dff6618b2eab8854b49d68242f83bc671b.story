The kingfisher is one of our shyest and most elusive birds, despite its eye-catching plumage.

And it appears art has imitated life in this John Constable painting.

Experts were astonished to find one of the birds depicted in the centre of The Mill Stream after it was cleaned for the first time in over 100 years.

Decades of accumulated grime and discoloured varnish had hidden the small but obviously important feature, portrayed in a splash of blue and red as it darts through the air in the shadow of some trees.

After a spruce up on its 200th anniversary it was revealed that a kingfisher had been hidden for years and can now be seen, circled

The 1814 painting shows a view of Willy Lott’s cottage at Flatford near East Bergholt, Suffolk – the same spot used seven years later in Constable’s best-known masterpiece, The Hay Wain.

The find emerged during an operation to spruce up the oil painting on its 200th anniversary.

It has now been rehung at the Wolsey Gallery in Christchurch Mansion, Ipswich, which has the largest collection of Constables outside London.

Robert Entwhistle, conservation officer with Colchester and Ipswich Museum Service, said the kingfisher was the most significant find during the conservation process.

‘The kingfisher was one of the elements that became more visible once the cleaning began,’ he added.

‘It is only a very small element of the painting but one we had no idea was there before we began the cleaning process.

‘It is only a blur of red and blue in the middle of the painting but one that Constable obviously thought was important.’

Other discoveries included the ghostly image of two other birds near the middle of the painting that the artist decided to paint over. A chimney on the house was also moved.

The kingfisher was first spotted by conservator Rosalind Whitehouse, who spent a month restoring the painting by painstakingly removing layer by layer the dirt and coatings of varnish that had been applied over the years.

She noticed the unexpected addition while comparing the original to an enhanced digital photograph.

‘The painting had not been cleaned for probably over 100 years and the old varnish had become so yellow and dark that the painting’s colours were hidden,’ she said.

‘In the light of all the great Constable paintings that have been cleaned in recent years in public collections, this one was suffering by comparison.

‘The cool sky colours and clear definition of the beautifully painted trees are now visible, as is the sense of depth in the picture space which had been flattened out by the varnish.’

Constable, who was born in 1776, is known mainly for his paintings of Dedham Vale, the area around his home now known as Constable Country.

Despite being one of Britain’s best-loved artists he struggled financially throughout his career and was not elected to the Royal Academy until he was 52. He died in 1837. 

A kingfisher's vivid colour is due to iridescence caused by different wavelengths of light 

The common kingfisher’s vivid colour is due to iridescence, caused by different wavelengths of light reflected from different layers of feathers. It’s natural pigment is dark brown.

The bird is highly territorial about its stretch of river as it has to eat close to its own body weight of fish and insects every day.

It doesn’t have a song to match its spectacular plumage. Instead, it generally emits short, sharp whistles.

Less than a third of the British population has seen a kingfisher.

Only half of fledglings survive the first fortnight on their own. Many become waterlogged and drown during their first dives into water for food.

The Dusun tribe in Borneo considered the Oriental dwarf kingfisher to be a bad omen. Warriors who spotted one on the way to battle return home.
