A fresh property bubble could be inflating as the Government's Help To Buy scheme boosts demand and mortgage lending reaches pre-crash levels, experts have warned.

The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) today said the number of surveyors reporting house price rises has surged to an 11-year high, and warned urgent action was needed to stop demand outstripping the supply of homes for sale.

Meanwhile the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) reported 'renewed strength' in the market, with home loans worth £26.1bn handed out in the third quarter of this year - the highest quarterly figure since winter 2007.

And property website Zoopla said that sellers were becoming more confident about sticking to their asking prices, with a drop in the percentage of vendors dropping their original prices.

The latest RICS UK survey found that sales volumes are at their highest levels in more than five and a half years as more people flood into the property market.

Nearly three-fifths (57 per cent) of surveyors reported price rises last month, the highest percentage since June 2002, reflecting the imbalance between supply and demand, RICS said.

And over the three months to October, surveyors sold just over 20 homes typically, the highest average since February 2008, according to the figures published today.

Looking ahead, they said they expect house prices and sales volumes to edge higher in the next three months.

Meanwhile, demand for rented property is increasing at its slowest pace in over a decade as more people make the jump on or up the property ladder, RICS reported.

But it said that while the new phase of Help to Buy - to give borrowers with deposits as small as five per cent a helping hand to buy a new-build or existing home - is 'widening the net' of people who can get mortgage access, surveyors across the UK are reporting a 'problematic' lack of new instructions from sellers.

RICS said that as 'soaring demand' pushes prices up, almost every region is reporting an increase in sales, showing that recovery is 'spreading beyond the traditional economic powerhouses of London and the South East'.

The new phase of the Government's Help to Buy scheme, which offers state-backed mortgages to people with deposits as low as 5 per cent, was fired into action last month after the start date was brought forward from January.

State-backed lenders Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), NatWest, Halifax and Bank of Scotland are already offering mortgages under the scheme.

Other major lenders including HSBC and Santander have confirmed plans to come on board at a later date.

The Council of Mortgage Lenders said that lending to home-buyers between July-September was at the strongest levels since winter 2007, and said it would help add momentum to the market going into 2014.

Simon Rubinsohn, RICS chief economist,
said: 'A greater willingness by lenders to increase loan to values on 
mortgage products allied to the Help to Buy scheme has meant that more 
and more first-time buyers are in a position to enter the market.

'In
spite of this, the amount of homes currently up for sale is still 
nowhere near enough to keep up with demand and, in order for the market 
to function correctly, this imbalance urgently needs to be addressed.

'House building starts have picked up recently but we are still well behind in terms of the amount of properties needed.

'Housebuilding
starts have picked up recently but we are still well behind in terms of
the amount of properties needed. If we are to create a more sustainable
market, it is critical that many more good quality homes are built in 
areas where people want to live.'

Fears
have been raised that the upward pressure on house prices could lead to
a 'bubble', with borrowers over-stretching themselves. Ultra-low 
interest rates and a string of Government schemes are currently helping 
to keep mortgage payments relatively affordable.

RICS
recently suggested that the Bank of England should use its powers to 
limit house price increases to 5 per cent a year to remove the 'froth' 
from price booms.

It said 
that an annual increase of around 5 per cent could trigger caps on how 
much people could borrow relative to their incomes or the value of the 
property.

Recent figures from the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) showed that house builders in England are starting more new properties than at any other time in the past three years.

But housing charity Shelter has previously warned that the country is still building less than half the number of new houses it needs each year to tackle the 'chronic shortage'.

Housing minister Kris Hopkins said: 'We are pulling out all the stops to get Britain building.'

He continued: 'Already, we're well on track to deliver 170,000 new affordable homes by 2015, and our plans to invest £19.5billion public and private funding over this spending review, and £23billion in the three years after that, will help towards the fastest rate of affordable housebuilding for two decades.

'Housing starts are now a third higher than at the same time last year and it is clear house building will remain a critical part of our economic recovery.

'In addition, our Help to Buy schemes will help thousands of aspiring homeowners buy new homes with a fraction of the deposit they would normally require - helping to boost the housebuilding industry even further as well as supporting responsible lending.

'On average households have asked to borrow around £155,000 for houses worth about £163,000, which is below the UK average price of £247,000.'
