Under pressure: Former shadow police minister David Ruffley was arrested and thrown in a cell before accepting a caution for common assault

A Tory MP is facing a crisis meeting about his future as anger mounts over an assault on his partner during an argument.

Former shadow police minister David Ruffley was arrested and thrown in a cell before accepting a caution for common assault.

Sources said his girlfriend at the time, Wendy Drew, called 999 when he flew into a rage and ordered her to leave his luxury flat in London. Details of the domestic violence incident emerged only last month, several weeks after it happened.

Since then, he has faced calls from 
church leaders, support groups and even political allies to step down as
 MP for Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk.

His
 local Conservative association has brought forward a meeting of its 
executive from September 9 to July 31 and he faces a reselection battle 
as he is grilled about his conduct.

Critics include the Dean of St Edmondsbury Cathedral, who has written Mr Ruffley calling on him to consider his position.

The Very Rev Frances Ward, a close friend of Mrs Drew, said he had lost the confidence of many of his supporters.

Copies of the letter were sent to council leaders and new Government chief whip Michael Gove, among others.

She said yesterday: ‘Everything I wished to say was contained within my letter and I would not wish to comment further.’

Jenny
 Antill, a member of Suffolk Domestic Abuse Partnership and a Tory 
county council cabinet member, said: ‘He is a part of a government who 
has stood out firmly against domestic abuse in all its forms and I think
 under those circumstances he really must consider his position.’

Another
 senior local Tory, Joanna Spicer, who is responsible for health and 
wellbeing in the county, accused the Conservative Party of ‘protecting 
David Ruffley from the consequences of his police caution’.

She added: ‘The Government published an excellent “Call for Action” on domestic violence only two years ago and has recently revised the action plan.

‘Their silence leads many people, including Conservative supporters, to conclude that they condone domestic violence.’

Cambridge-educated Mr Ruffley was a solicitor and an adviser to Tory Cabinet minister Ken Clarke before becoming an MP.

He escaped with cuts and bruises after falling underneath a train in June 2010 following revelations about claims he made during the MPs’ expenses scandal including the purchase of a sofa and television.

In an interview with the Daily Mail last year he admitted having a ‘bout of depression’ but said he had turned things around and ‘the best is yet to come’.

Tory heartland: Bury St. Edmonds, Suffolk, the constituency Mr Ruffley represents in the House of Commons

Four months after the brush with death at London’s Victoria station he met Irish-born Mrs Drew, 56, a portrait and landscape artist whose later husband was a wealthy property developer.

He is now a member of the Treasury Select Committee and had been re-selected to fight his seat in 2015 before the incident in March at his luxury flat in Pimlico, a short distance from Westminster.

Bury St Edmunds Conservative Association confirmed it had written to Mr Ruffley ‘requesting’ that he attend.

Chairman Andrew Speed said the MP had always been due to attend the September meeting and other matters were due to be discussed.

‘This is not an “emergency” meeting. I’m sure members will want to ask David about the incident but we have other matters to deal with including how we will fight next year’s election.’

Mrs Drew was asked for a comment via her lawyers, Withers LLP, but there was no response.

A close friend previously claimed she was ‘scared’ of her former partner, adding: ‘I think she stayed for fear of what he might do if she left. He treated her that badly.’

Mr Ruffley has so far refused to discuss the police caution and remained silent yesterday.

A Conservative Party spokesman said: ‘This matter was investigated by the police and dealt with by them at the time.’
