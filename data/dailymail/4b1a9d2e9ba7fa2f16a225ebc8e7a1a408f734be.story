Swiss food giant Nestle has vowed to remove all traces of artificial colors and flavors from its chocolates by the end of this year - becoming the first major US candy manufacturer to do so.

The company announced yesterday that it is committed to giving its customers the healthier ingredients that they have been asking for and will therefore be swapping the artificial flavors and certified colors currently found in its beloved candy for natural alternatives, 'without affecting taste or increasing the price' of its chocolates.

'We never compromise on taste,' Leslie Mohr, the company’s nutrition, health and wellness manager, said in a statement about the changes, which will affect more than 250 products, including Nestle Crunch, Butterfinger and Baby Ruth.

She added: 'When making these changes to more than 75 recipes, maintaining the great taste and appearance consumers expect from the chocolate brands they know and love is our number one priority.'

For example, the Red 40 and Yellow 5 additives used to make the crispy golden center of Nestle's Butterfinger bars will eventually be replaced with annatto, which comes from the seeds of achiote trees.

Meanwhile the brand's Crunch bars will soon be made with natural vanilla flavor instead of artificial vanillin.

Nestle looked into making the changes after its internal research indicated that US consumers would prefer popular candy brands to be free of artificial flavors and colors.

The updated products will begin hitting shelves in mid-2015 and feature a 'No Artificial Flavors or Colors' label on its candy wrappers.

And this is just the beginning.

Nestle is also in the process of removing caramel coloring from its chocolate products.

'Our commitment to remove artificial flavors and certified colors in our chocolate candy brands is an important milestone,' said Doreen Ida, the company’s US president. 'We know that candy consumers are interested in broader food trends around fewer artificial ingredients.'

She added: 'We’re excited to be the first major U.S. candy manufacturer to make this commitment.'
