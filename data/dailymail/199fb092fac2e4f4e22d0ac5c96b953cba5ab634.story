Great Britain's David Weir today became the greatest wheelchair racer of all time as he won his fourth Paralympic gold medal of London 2012.

The 33-year-old, nicknamed the 'Weirwolf', timed his sprint finish to perfection in the T54 marathon to take the title in one hour 30.20 minutes.

With tens of thousands of people lining the route to cheer him on, the home favourite was in a leading group of six racers which broke away early on, content to sit just off the front.

Weir, from Sutton, South London, was 
second behind Switzerland's Marcel Hug in a leading pack of three, also 
including Australian defending champion Kurt Fearnley with three miles 
to go.

Weir
came into view of the finishing straight in the lead and pulled away 
from his rivals to complete a glorious end to a spectacular week.

Victory
gave the British wheelchair racing champion a clean sweep of four gold 
medals after earlier winning the T54 800, 1500 and 5,000 metres titles 
on the track in the Olympic Stadium.

Speaking after the momentous win, a clearly-exhausted Weir revealed he felt as though he was 'going to die' just five miles in.

He said: 'The first six miles were the hardest. I thought I was going to die. I felt like I had no energy and thought "if they keep this speed up, I won't last another mile".'

He praised the incredible crowd, which he said 'were there for him' throughout the race and helped push him over the line.

Weir,
whose partner Emily Thorne is pregnant with their second child, has 
become the biggest star of the Paralympics and trademark 'Weirwolf' howls from fans
have reverberated throughout the Olympic Stadium.

London 2012 chairman Lord Coe said following Weir's win: 'He has just had a majestic Games. He is a phenomenal athlete.'

There was more to cheer for the patriotic crowd as Shelly Woods powered home to win silver in the female marathon just minutes later.

After the win, Woods described the race as 'the hardest marathon of my life'.

Weir's marathon triumph brought him his sixth Paralympic gold medals in total. He won two titles on the track in Beijing four years ago.

The father of two, who has 'winner' tattooed on his arm in Japanese, has been unable to use his legs since birth and suffered a spine injury that left him walking with calipers.

He first competed in the Atlanta 
Paralympics in 1996 as a teenager, but abandoned sport soon afterwards 
after being disillusioned by the empty stadiums at that Games.

He returned in 2004 after being inspired by watching Tanni-Grey Thompson at the Sydney Paralympics.

In winning his fourth gold medal of 
London 2012, Weir has matched the achievement of fellow British 
Paralympian Sarah Storey, who also completed a clean sweep of her 
events.

Storey
won the women's cycling road race and time trial events at Brands 
Hatch, and also claimed gold in the 500m time trial and the individual 
pursuit in the velodrome.

She has 11 gold medals overall, having first competed at the Paralympics as a swimmer in Barcelona in 1992.

Weir's
win completes an excellent Games for Great Britain's Paralympians, 
which has seen an unprecedented number of medals won in front of packed 
stadiums as millions watch on TV.

The Great Britain team has a medal tally of 120 - 34 of golds, 43 silver and 43 bronze, surpassing their target of 103.
