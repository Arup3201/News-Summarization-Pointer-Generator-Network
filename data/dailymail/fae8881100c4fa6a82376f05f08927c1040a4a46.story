Goals from Leicester’s Riyad Mahrez and Tottenham’s Nabil Bentaleb put Algeria into the quarter-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations at the expense of Senegal.

Ghana’s late flourish in Mongomo, coming from behind to beat South Africa, saw them put Senegal out of the competition, despite starting the day top of the group.

Algeria had to settle for second place, but they can be encouraged by a much better performance in their final game, capped by a stunning strike from Bentaleb.

The Spurs midfielder lashed in the second goal from outside the box to seal the win nine minutes from time, and send the Algerian fans into ecstasy.

It was no less than the Desert Foxes deserved, as they survived the physical Senegalese onslaught far better than either of the other sides had managed so far in this tournament.

And, with their long-ball tactics producing next to nothing, Senegal had little else to offer, particularly after Southampton’s Sadio Mane, by far their most creative player, was withdrawn with 25 minutes left to play.

At the start of play both sides knew they would be guaranteed a place in the quarter-finals with a win, but either could go out if they lost and the result in Mongomo went against them.

The onus was on Algeria, with Senegal only needing a point, and they showed more intensity from the very first minute than they had in either of their first two games.

Inside 90 seconds the Desert Foxes should have been ahead, Hila Soudani – playing for the first time in the competition – robbing Serigne Mbodji and setting Valencia’s Sofiane Feghouli through on goal.

The winger, however, with all the time in the world, seemed to panic, and failed to take the ball around Senegal keeper Bouna Coundoul.

It set the tone for the game, Senegal’s defence – so solid before this game – surprisingly off the pace, with Soundani a constant nuisance.

And they were punished for a lack of concentration on 11 minutes, an innocuous ball over the top from the half-way line leaving the entire back three standing, as Leicester City’s Riyad Mahrez stole in behind.

Mahrez, so disappointing in the first game that he was dropped for the second, showed why he had been recalled, controlling nicely before calmly slotting home past Coundoul.

Senegal, for the third time in the tournament, had to try and come from behind, and they did pose an attacking threat in flashes, with Mane playing just off Stoke City’s Mame Biram Diouf.

Diouf’s pace in behind forced Rais Mbolhi to charge out of the Agleria goal to clear on one occasion, while Mane’s trickery posed a threat.

But the finishing Senegalese was lacking, the Saints winger once undone by a bobble on the pitch, and later flashing over after dancing past a couple of defenders.

Their best chance came just before half-time, when Papa Kouly Diop played in Stephane Badji as the Algerian defence switched off from a freekick.

With time and space inside the box, however, the wing-back took too long to get his shot away, allowing Bentaleb to get across brilliantly and make a crucial block.

Even with Senegal pouring men forward in search of an eqaulaiser it was the Algerians who looked more likely to score.

They were only denied a second by a brilliant goal-line clearance from Mbodji, after Saphir Taider had fired a shot from the edge of the box, before Mahrez wasted a good chance on the break.

But it mattered little, Bentaleb’s stunner securing the win, and progress into the knock-out stages.
