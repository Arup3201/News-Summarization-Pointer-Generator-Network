Apple’s eagerly awaited iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsets go on sale in nine days.

But this hasn't stopped fans queuing up outside Apple shops around the world so they can be among the first to own the new smartphones.

People with prime spots outside these shops could also earn money for being so keen - with one place in New York already being sold for $2,500 (£1,500).

Almost there: Apple's eagerly awaited iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsets go on sale tomorrow. But this hasn't stopped fans queuing up outside Apple shops around the world so they can be among the first to own the new smartphones. This photo was taken of fans in Tokyo earlier today

Fans in Tokyo (pictured) began queuing for the devices, which have been met with rave reviews from journalists, on the day of Apple's event last week 

In Tokyo and Sydney, groups are camped outside in relatively balmy weather, while in London, tents are already positioned outside the Apple Store on Regent Street.

A handful of fans have been queuing outside the firm's Fifth Avenue store since September 1, when the phones were still a rumour.

'We wanted to beat the record, which had been 18 days,' Brian Ceballo, who arrived at Apple's NYC flagship on Sunday to wait, told CNBC.

One couple - Moon Ray, 25 and Jason, 29, were among seven people in new York queuing up a week ago.

Checking in: These fans are today queuing outside the Apple Store on Regent Street, London. They have been fortunate that the weather has remained warm ahead of tomorrow's launch

They travelled over 1,000 miles (1,609km) from Jackson, Mississippi and arrived in New York on September 1 to find that they were not first in the queue, because cousins and New Yorkers Joseph Cruz and Brian Ceballo had beaten them to it.

The Mississippi couple paid $2,500 (£1,500) to swap places with the cousins.

Zoltan Wiettchen, 24, is the first in line in London after staking a place at 9pm on Monday night.

Mr Wiettchen, a Hungarian national who has been in this country for two years, said he is not planning on buying one of the handsets, but rather in the money he can make from queuing up. 

Cosy queuing: A handful of fans have been queuing outside the firm's Fifth Avenue store since  September 3, when the phones were still a rumour. This means they will have been camping out for over two weeks

The wait is on: People with prime spots outside shops could earn big bucks for their patience and some plan on selling their places in the queue for up to £1,000. Here, tents are pitched outside Apple's flagship store on London's Regent Street

Finally unveiled: Apple showed off two handsets last night as well as a smartwatch called Apple Watch. The iPhone 6 (pictured left) has a 4.7-inch screen, curved edges and will be available in dark black and gold, while the iPhone 6 Plus (right) has a 5.5-inch screen and 185 per cent more pixels than the 5S

Waiting with a friend: The iPhone 6 will start at $199 on a two-year contract for 16GB, $299 for 64GB and $399 for 128GB, while the iPhone 6 Plus starts at $299 for 16GB, $399 for 64GB and $499 for 128GB.

A comfortable wait: People are queuing up with their tents and seats outside Apple Fifth Avenue to buy the new iPhone handsets. These fans have been queuing since September 5

‘I don’t care about the phone at all. I’m not here for that,’ he said. ‘But I know lots of people do care about it and would be desperate to be the first person to use it.

‘I’m queuing to sell my position and I’m hoping to get £1,000 for it. I want to start a business as a personal trainer and that money would help me out a lot.

‘I’ve just finished studying an English language course so had a bit of spare time. It’s a good experience and I need the money.

‘My girlfriend and I are sharing the camping, I’m sleeping here and she’s going to be here during the day. I may be here for the next 10 days but I’m off as soon as someone gives me an offer.

‘It’s very noisy here, I’m spending much of my time with my tent shut trying to sleep, but people keep interrupting me to ask me what I’m doing.’

Keen: Apple fans Salvatore Gerace (left) and Christian Ibrahim (right) have got in line early for the new iPhone 6 at the Apple Store in Sydney - with other gadgets to make the wait seem slightly shorter

Selling out? While some people camping out 10 days early are genuine fans, waiting to get their hands on the handset, others hope to sell their place in line. One person camped out in London (store pictured right) is hoping to get £1,000 for their efforts - which could buy them a couple of handsets at a later date

A couple who travelled more than 1,000 miles to stand in line outside the Apple store on Fifth Avenue, New York, have paid $2,500 (£1,500) to be first in line.

Moon Ray 25, and her husband Jason, 29 travelled from Jackson, Mississippi on September 1 to discover there was already a queue outside the shop.

Cousins Joseph Cruz and Brian Ceballo from Statten Island, New York had beaten them to it by one day – but happily accepted the money to switch places.

‘We take turns going to the bathroom and washing and working out at the gym nearby,’ Ms Moon said

‘We only sleep a couple of hours a night - I brought a tent but cried when they told me I couldn’t use it.’

Joseph, who was third in line last week, is a veteran at waiting in line for Apple product, having camped out for new releases before.

Ms Moon said: ‘People passing by say all sorts of things to us - they think we’re crazy.’

One of the tents is being manned by Task Rabbit, an online company that outsources household errands, after being paid by a client to queue up on their behalf.

Uma Subramanian of the firm, said: ‘We’re taking it in turns to man the tent for a client who requested our services online. I cannot say how much he paid us or who he is, because that’s confidential, but our workers charge between £10 and £20 an hour for whatever activity they have been paid to do.’

Apple unveiled its latest smartphone last night alongside its much hyped Apple Watch. The iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch screen, curved edges and will be available in dark black and gold, while the iPhone 6 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen and 185 per cent more pixels than the 5S.

The iPhone 6 will start at $199 on a two-year contract for 16GB, $299 for 64GB and $399 for 128GB, while the iPhone 6 Plus starts at $299 for 16GB, $399 for 64GB and $499 for 128GB.

The iPhone 6 is 6.9mm and the iPhone 6 Plus is 7.1mm thick, compared to 7.6mm on the 5S. Both devices have Retina HD displays.

Both handsets feature the new Apple A8 64-bit chip, an 8MP camera and iOS 8 software, among a host of other features.

How the handsets stack up: The iPhone 6 is 6.9mm, the iPhone 6 Plus is 7.1mm thick. This table shows how the new handsets compare with rival offerings

Queuing becomes a business: One of the tents in London (not pictured) is being manned byan online company that outsources household errands, with a client thought to be paying between £10 and £20 an hour for the service - showing how much some people want the handset
