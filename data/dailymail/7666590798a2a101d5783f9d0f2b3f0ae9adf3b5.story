A Ferrari driver was remarkably uninjured after he smashed his supercar into this central reservation of the M1.

These images show the aftermath of the high-speed crash, which took place near to Woolley Edge services in Wakefield, West Yorkshire.

The front of the Ferrari 458 Italia is almost destroyed in the images, while the bonnet sticks up in the air.

Smash: A driver was left uninjured when he smashed his Ferrari 458 into the central reservation on the M1

Damage: The car's bumper was smashed following the collision near Wakefield, West Yorkshire, on Monday

Luckily, the rest of the car - prices for which start at around £170,000, appears relatively unscathed.

Fortunately, the driver was not injured in the crash - which took place at around 3.45pm on Monday.

No one else was harmed in the crash either, police confirmed.

Officers took to Twitter after the collision to issue road safety advice after the car careered into the barrier on the northbound carriageway.

The West Yorkshire Road Policing Unit tweeted: 'Ferrari RTC into the central reservation! Bad weather conditions be careful.'

Warning: West Yorkshire Police road unit tweeted this picture of the crash - taking the opportunity to warn drivers about poor driving conditions due to bad weather

Hot wheels: Officers then commented on the £170,000 vehicle - saying it was a 'very nice car'

Production of the Ferrari 458 began in 2009. It is rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive

There are two different body types: Berlinetta and Spider

Engine: 4.5L V8 (562 hp at 9,000 rpm)

Transmission: 7-speed dual-clutch

Acceleration: 0-100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.3 seconds

Top speed: 325 km/h (202 mph)

Price: Begins at £169,545

They later added: 'It was a very nice car.'

The Ferrari's 0-60mph acceleration is 3.3 seconds with a top speed of 202 mph.

It is powered by a 4.5L V8 engine which produces 562 hp at 9,000 rpm.

Last week, another Ferrari was in the spotlight for a very different reason - because its owner had wrapped it in £4,000 work of gold vinyl.

The £200,000 248 Spider belonged to kickboxing world champion Riyadh Al-Azzawi.

Mr Al-Azzawi parked the Italian supercar outside a gym in Kensington, London, where he was training.

It wasn't long before it attracted crowds of gawping onlookers - some of which even took videos of the rather garish vehicle.
