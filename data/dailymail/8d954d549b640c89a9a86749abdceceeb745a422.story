A wounded soldier who was horribly burned while serving in Afghanistan is moving forward from what was once intense pain - all with the help of this unconventional treatment.

Lt Sam Brown suffered burns over 30 per cent of his body when the Humvee he was riding in was blown up by an IED in 2008.

He survived, but was burned so badly in the explosion that he was kept in a medically-induced coma for weeks.

When he was flown back to the U.S., the daily treatments of the burns sometimes proved to be too much to handle, but Lt Brown was reluctant to take highly addictive painkillers.

Dr Christopher Maani, an anesthesiologist at the Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, offered Lt Brown another option.

Dr Maani told NBC News' Rock Center that the game, SnowWord, helps a patient take their mind off the pain so that doctors can continue rehabilitation.

Lt Brown told the network: 'I was a little bit skeptical. But honestly, I was willing to try anything.'

Dr David Patterson, the University of Washington psychologist who co-created SnowWorld with fellow psychologist Dr Hunter Hoffman, explained:  'With virtual reality distraction, you're taking a painful procedure like scrubbing off a wound.

'You're just taking the person and putting them in an alternate world. And it works for as long as people seem to be in the virtual world.'

Sound is also played in stereo - whether it be the roars of mammoths being hit with snowballs or background music.

In a study published in 2007 Sam Sharar, an anaesthesiology professor at Washington University, said the therapy could be as effective at controlling pain as an intravenous dose of hydromorphone - a potent derivate of morphine.

Thanks to SnowWorld, Lt Brown was able to continue his treatments pain free without the help of any painkillers.

NBC News reported that he is now married with a one-year-old son, and treasures his time with family.

Lt Brown told the network: 'The world I have now with Amy, and Roman, and God willing, more children, is all I need.'
