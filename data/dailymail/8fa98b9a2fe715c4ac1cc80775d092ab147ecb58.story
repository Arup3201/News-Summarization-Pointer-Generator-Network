France is one step closer to legalising euthanasia after approving a bill that allows doctors to sedate terminally ill patients until they die.

The bill stops short of recommending lethal injections and avoids the terms euthanasia or assisted suicide, but would give people 'the right to deep, continuous sedation until death'.

This must be at the patient's request, but only when their condition is life-threatening in the short-term.

Protests: Demonstrators gather near the French National Assembly holding white silhouettes as part of a silent protest against euthanasia in Paris on March 10. Slogans read: 'Let's relieve but do not kill'

On March 10. pro-euthanasia demonstrators held signs reading: 'Francois let's act like Holland'. Euthanasia has been taking place in Holland for many years

The proposed measure was passed by a vote of 436 to 34 in France's lower house of Parliament, and it must now be debated by the Senate.

Backed by the Socialist government, the bill would also force doctors in France to follow end-of-life instructions expressed by the patients themselves, or written in advance if they are no longer able to state their wishes.

Almost one in 20 people in northern Belgium died using euthanasia in 2013, more than doubling the numbers in six years, a study released today showed.

The universities of Ghent and Brussels found that since euthanasia was legalised in 2002, the acceptance of ending a life at the patient's request has greatly increased. 

While a 2007 survey showed 1.9 percent of deaths from euthanasia in the region, the figure was 4.6 percent in 2013.

'Euthanasia has been increasingly accepted by the patients as a valid option at the end of their life,' said Ghent University ethics professor Freddy Mortier. 

'Physicians themselves are more inclined to comply with the wishes of the patients."

Euthanasia is legal only in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg

Earlier this month in a speech at France's lower house of Parliament, Prime minister Manuel Valls praised 'a reform that proclaims the right to die peacefully, in dignity and without suffering'.

The bill has stirred debate in France and prompted a call for the preservation of 'the prohibition of killing' by five high-profile Christian, Muslim and Jewish leaders. 

It has prompted protests by those claiming the bill amounts to disguised euthanasia, as well as pro-euthanasia campaigners who believe it does not go far enough.

Doctors are also divided about the idea. So-called terminal or 'palliative sedation' can involve medicating patients until they die naturally of their illnesses, or until they starve.

The method does not actively kill patients, but some doctors say it can mean patients are sedated for weeks before they die, and that it may be more humane to euthanise. 

French debate over end-of-life legislation resurfaced last year over the case of comatose Frenchman Vincent Lambert. 

His wife wants doctors to stop life support but his parents disagree. The case is pending at the European Court of Human Rights.
