An Oxford University rugby club is to be disciplined after an invite for a party told players to pick a 'fresher of their choice' and spike their drinks. 

The crude claim was made in an email sent by a committee member from Pembroke College Rugby team announcing a ‘Crew Date’ with a female society.

Club secretary Woo Kim encouraged players to choose a female student as their date and then spike their wine with a 'substance' of their choice.

The fifty recipients of the vulgar invitation were told the 'substance' could be 'anything you like' and also urged members to 'bring a positive pregnancy test'.

The players were also asked to bring two bottles of wine with them, one for themselves and one for their 'guests'.

The evening was due to take place on Thursday but it was cancelled after angry protests.

The content of this e-mail is completely 
unacceptable, and I am taking the appropriate action on behalf of the 
College authorities

Dr Clive Siviour, Dean of Pembroke College, said: 'The content of this e-mail is completely unacceptable, and I am taking the appropriate action on behalf of the College authorities.

'These actions of a small number of students have been met with universal condemnation from their peers.'

Mr Kim, a second-year history and economics student, has been forced to step down from the club’s committee.

The shamed team have also been made to sit through a sexual consent discussion forum with college chiefs.

Third-year Pembroke student Will Brown said: 'I, like the vast majority of students at Pembroke, was disgusted by these comments.

'They represent an ugly, corrosive form of misogyny that simply shouldn’t be tolerated in any level of society, and that can’t just be dismissed as yet another supposedly harmless juvenile ‘joke’.'

Oxford feminist campaigner Lottie Sykes said: 'This email is another example of the sinister misogyny that encourages targeting younger female students through college crew dates.'

The controversial email came after the Pembroke rugby club declined an invitation to a Good Lad campaign workshop run by Oxford University Rugby Club to promote 'positive masculinity.'

A spokesman for Pembroke rugby club said: 'We accept that the emails circulated earlier this week about our proposed Crew Date were entirely misguided and represent a serious case of poor judgement.

'We would like to clarify that the “challenge” proposed in advance of the intended Crew Date was intended to be a harmless drinking game joke, and was in no way intended to mean that the team member should lace their dates’ drinks with anything illegal and/or to engage in any sexual abuse.'
