Paul Gascoigne has revealed Arsenal  paid £50,000 towards his medical care - and that part of that was arranged by Arsene Wenger.

The 47-year-old was spotted for the first time recently following an apparent alcohol binge that led to Gascoigne being sectioned under the Mental Health Act a month ago.

The ex-England midfielder has told how Arsenal, a team he never played for and north London rivals of his former club Tottenham Hotspur, helped pay for his treatment.

'I rang up (Arsenal) physio Gary Lewin and told him I wasn't feeling great,' Gascoigne told The Sun. 

'He said to go to hospital as he feared it was pneumonia. Wenger then agreed to arrange £28,000 to pay for treatment. Arsenal also paid £22,000 when I had hip treatment.'

But, when Tottenham were facing Real Madrid in 2011 in the Champions League, Gascoigne claims he was told by his former club that he would have to pay to get into White Hart Lane.

'I wanted to watch Spurs against Real Madrid and got told they only had two tickets for £60,' he continues.

'I'd have to watch from under the directors' box with some players who played 30 years before me.' 

Gascoigne spent almost a week in hospital after being sectioned under the Mental Health Act in October, and says he was doing '800 press-ups, 800 sit-ups and 800 squats per day' to stay fit.

Gascoigne is still remembered for his stunning goal against Scotland during Euro 96 at Wembley

He promises he is on the mend, and adds: 'There is nothing wrong me - as long as I don't pick up a can. The only person who can save me is me.'

Gascoigne tells The Sun that police turned up at his home and put him in a van, though not in handcuffs. A trip to hospital followed for a brain scan, which 'came up fine'.

But the next thing the England legend knew, he continues, was that he was at St Ann's Hospital in Poole, Dorset, where he spent almost a week and was told to rest.

He has struggled with alcohol addiction for several years since retiring from the game in 2004.

Gazza made 57 appearances for England, but later entered rehab seven times and was first sectioned under the Mental Health Act in 2008 following an incident at a Newcastle hotel.
