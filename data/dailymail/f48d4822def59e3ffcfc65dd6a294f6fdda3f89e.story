Fitted with laser-guided bombs and Hellfire missiles, these are the RAF's newest Reaper Drones which are being used in Afghanistan

Their main role is to gather intelligence and carry out surveillance for forces on the ground, but they can also be armed with deadly weapons.

Pictures released today show the unmanned aircraft being assembled and flying from Kandahar airfield on missions which will help Afghan, UK and ISAF forces.

Information gathering: Their main role will be to gather intelligence and carry out surveillance operations

The deployment of five new Reapers means there are twice as many in Afghanistan operating alongside the Army’s Hermes 450 unmanned aircraft. 

Their ability to provide real-time video to commanders on the ground is said to be vital to efforts to cement security in Afghanistan as allied forces pull out of the country.

The aircraft, dubbed by some as 'eyes in the sky', will be operated by XIII Sqn from RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire, and 39 Squadron at Creech Air Force Base in the USA.

The MoD has been keen to step away from the term 'drone' when talking about unmanned air systems, because it elicits ideas of unaccountable computerised technology.

In December the MoD said there had been more than 54,000 hours of operations using Reaper in Afghanistan, with only 459 weapons fired - less than one weapon for every 120 hours flying - while non-armed reconnaissance Unmanned Air Systems had flown almost three times as many operations, flying over 160,000 hours.

Announcing the latest Reapers, Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology Philip Dunne said: 'These new aircraft give the RAF enhanced Force Protection capability in support of UK, ISAF and Afghan troops.

'As we focus on the drawdown of UK forces from Afghanistan, the ability to provide force protection will become increasingly important and Reaper allows us to provide this assurance, remotely and without significant ground presence.'

Air Commodore Al Gillespie, who is responsible for the command and control of UK Air assets over Afghanistan, added: 'These aircraft will support UK, ISAF and Afghan forces as they work to protect the people of Afghanistan.

'They provide vital intelligence and precise strike capability without putting our servicemen and women at risk. 

'As we drawn down from Afghanistan it is precisely this technology that will keep us one step ahead and allow us to combat internal security in the country.'

Prevelant: More than 50,000 hours worth of operations in Afghanistan have been completed using Reaper drones, according to the MoD
