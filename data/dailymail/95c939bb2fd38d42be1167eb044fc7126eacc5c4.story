Jose Mourinho is furious with the Spanish Football Federation after star striker Diego Costa was ruled out of Saturday’s clash at Crystal Palace through injury.

Costa, the leading scorer in the Barclays Premier League with nine goals, returned to Chelsea on Monday after playing for Spain in two Euro 2016 qualifiers.

Mourinho had publicly asked Spain coach Vicente del Bosque to use the international break to rest the forward, but he ignored the Chelsea boss and last night it was unclear for how long the striker would be sidelined. Costa scored his first international goal in the 4-0 victory over Luxembourg.

Costa played all but eight minutes for the national team last week and Mourinho revealed: 'Yes. The Spanish team played in Luxembourg on Sunday. I gave them Diego, Fabregas and Azpilicueta.

'I gave them two days off, Monday and Tuesday, so they had to report to train on Wednesday at 3pm. And Diego was here Monday at 9am. So you can imagine how strong he was to be here at 9am on Monday.' 

The Chelsea boss added: ‘I don’t lose my time contacting managers from national teams. In the past they used to contact me, but it is never my initiative to contact national team coaches.

‘They have the power, we don’t have the power.

'Every Chelsea player who is selected at that time, we are happy that the players represent their country.' 

Ramires, Andre Schurrle, John Obi Mikel and Didier Drogba could also miss the trip to Selhurst Park as Mourinho admitted Chelsea have a 'long, long' injury list.
