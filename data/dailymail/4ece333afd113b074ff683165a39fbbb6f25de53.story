Ed Miliband faced fresh mockery today after a second Labour attack advert in a week backfired.

The party released a poster accusing David Cameron and Nick Clegg of being 'two peas in a pod' and putting £450 on a family's food bill. It said George Osborne's 2010 VAT hike to 20 per cent had caused the price of the weekly shop to rocket.

But the poster featured a host of everyday items that carry no VAT at all - because they are deemed essential by the Government.

Labour's new attack on the Coalition accused Nick Clegg and David Cameron of acting together to hike the cost of the weekly shop. But most of a family's everyday food bill is VAT free

The botched attack ad came just days after the party was accused of resorting to a 'crass' class war after releasing a party political broadcast featuring Nick Clegg as the 'Un-credible shrinking man'.

Today's poster shows the Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader surrounded by images of everyday goods, including fruit and vegetables, soft drinks, ketchup and biscuits.

But most food and drink carries no VAT - although duty is charged on specific products such as alcohol, crisps and savoury snacks, and confectionery.

However, even the chocolate chip cookies used in Labour's poster campaign appear to be VAT-free.

According to Treasury rules, 'biscuits covered or partly covered in chocolate or some other products similar in taste and appearance to chocolate are standard-rated' at 20 per cent.

But 'chocolate chip biscuits where the chips are either included in the dough or pressed into the surface before baking' are VAT free.

Only when biscuits are 'wholly or partly coated' in chocolate do they carry VAT, according to HMRC's bizarre rules.

However, they are at pains to point out that the classic 'bourbon' biscuit 'and other biscuits where the chocolate or similar product forms a sandwich layer between two biscuit halves'  are not taxed at all.

'Jaffa cakes and biscuits coated with caramel' are also VAT free.

Tory MP Henry Smith accused Labour of not knowing what they were talking about.

He said: 'It's the same old economic incompetence from Labour. They have no long-term plan to fix the economy so instead Ed Miliband resorts to political gimmicks that don't even add up.'

A spoof of the Labour ad was almost immediately created online, replacing Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg with Labour's leading figures Mr Miliband and Ed Balls.

The impromptu rebuttal says: 'Miliband and Balls, two Eds with no idea.'

The Tories immediately flipped the Labour attack back on Ed Miliband - accusing him of being so 'out of touch' he did not know food was VAT-free

But a Labour Party spokesman said: 'David Cameron and Nick Clegg are desperately trying to deflect from the truth of their VAT bombshell.

'Their decision to increase VAT has added £450 to family bills over the year, on the Treasury's own figures.

'Families are paying more on their typical weekly shop as a result of the Tories and the Lib Dems and this poster rightly holds them to account.

'It is not an itemised list of everything they have increased VAT on - it is a representation of an average shopping basket.'

Earlier this week Mr Miliband faced criticism from members of his own party over its 'un-credible shrinking man' political broadcast.

Ed Miliband has been accused of resorting to 'crass' class warfare in Labour's new advert for the European elections which features a shrinking Nick Clegg character (pictured)

The US-style attack advert is based on the 1950s film The Incredible Shrinking Man and seeks to portray Tories (character on right) as out-of-touch toff who bully Nick Clegg (left)

The film, titled shows an actor playing Mr Clegg shrinking in size as he 
ditches policies such as opposition to university tuition fees.

By the end of the film – a parody of the US 1957 movie The Incredible Shrinking Man – he is a tiny doll-like figure.

The ad is thought to be the first product of Labour's new collaboration with American election guru David Axelrod

One Tory ‘minister’ suggests he should be hunted, before an actor playing the PM sets the Downing Street cat on him.

The US-style attack ad is thought to be the first product of Labour’s relationship with American elections guru David Axelrod.

A Labour source said: ‘It was aimed at younger people who don’t usually engage with politics and we think it has been effective.’

Party election campaign co-ordinator Douglas Alexander said the film was ‘a bit of fun’ but made a ‘serious point’.

But critics in the party say its relentlessly negative message suggested a lack of ambition.

Some MPs said it recalled the 2008 Crewe and Nantwich by-election when an attempt to paint Tory candidate Edward Timpson as a toff backfired and led to a humiliating defeat.

One former minister described the film as ‘crass’. He added: ‘We tried waging class war in Crewe. It failed then and it will fail now.

'The trouble is the kids in the leader’s team are probably too young to remember that.’

Another Labour MP said the broadcast was ‘depressing’, adding: ‘Where was the positive vision to attract swing voters?’

Mark Ferguson, editor of the influential grassroots website LabourList, said the film lacked a ‘positive agenda’.

Left-wing Guardian columnist Owen Jones said it was ‘a classic example of politics with the hope stripped away’.

The advert takes place around the Cabinet table as 'posh' Tories lead by an actor playing David Cameron force Nick Clegg to backtrack on policies such as tuition fees

As Clegg abandons each of the policies he shrinks into his suit. However Labour critics say the ad doesn't mention Europe or their party

Mr Clegg tried to laugh off the film’s efforts to ridicule him. He said: ‘They spent money on this? Particularly from Ed Miliband who is the sort of missing man in British politics.

‘He hasn’t breathed a word about the issue we’re supposed to be debating, which is whether we’re in or out of Europe.’
