Peaches Geldof's widower Thomas Cohen has not returned to the country home they shared because he was left so traumatised by her death, it has been reported.

The inquest into her death this week heard how Mr Cohen, 24, found his wife slumped dead on a bed with puncture marks and almost 80 syringes were scattered in their home.

She
 had been looking after their baby son Phaedra, who was left alone for 
up to 17 hours.

Tragic death: Thomas Cohen (right), who married Peaches Geldof in 2012, has not returned to the country home they shared in Kent because he was left so traumatised by her death, it has been reported

Investigation: Police at the couple's £1million home in Wrotham, Kent, after she was found dead in April

An unnamed neighbour of the £1million home in Wrotham, Kent, told the Daily Mirror it had been mostly empty since her body was found on April 7 and Mr Cohen planned to sell it.

'Thomas hasn't been back to the house for a long time,' the neighbour said. 'Whenever he needs something, he gets his mum to pick it up.

'He is haunted by what has happened and is constantly reminded of Peaches and the happy times they shared, as well as the moment he found her.'

Mr Cohen gave evidence on Wednesday at the inquest into 25-year-old Peaches' death.

North West Kent Coroner Roger Hatch said the television 
presenter, model and journalist had been trying to wean herself off 
drugs and was clean five months before she died.

Inquest: Mr Cohen told the hearing this week in Gravesend, Kent, how he discovered his wife's body

The inquest heard Peaches had been clean five months before she died but then relapsed in February this year

Stashes of heroin, burned spoons and almost 80 syringes were scattered around the 25-year-old’s country home when police investigated.

Her husband had tried to contact her in vain the night before, and returned from a weekend away to find her body.

A used syringe was in a sweet box next to her body and a pair of knotted tights had apparently been used as a tourniquet, the hearing in Gravesend, Kent, was told.

Mr Cohen told the hearing she relapsed in February and was hiding heroin in the loft of their home.

Supplies of heroin found in the house and tested by police were 61 per cent pure, the inquest heard, which meant they were of ‘importation quality’ and more than twice as pure as street-level product.

Mr Cohen had been rehearsing on the 
weekend of her death. He had dropped off their two sons – Astala, two, 
and Phaedra, one – with his parents in south-east London, leaving his 
wife of two years behind.

The following night, Miss Geldof had dinner in London, staying at a friend’s house in Hampstead.

Phaedra was returned to her by Mr Cohen’s father Keith on the Saturday afternoon and she stayed in that evening watching TV.

On the Sunday night, a few hours before her death, she posted a picture of herself and her mother on the social networking site Instagram, adding the caption: ‘Me and my mum.’

Miss Yates died of a heroin overdose at the age of 41 when her daughter was 11.

Mr Cohen, who was the singer in the band S.C.U.M., paid tribute to his wife of 19 months after she died.

He said: 'My beloved wife Peaches was adored by myself and her two sons Astala and Phaedra and I shall bring them up with their mother in their hearts everyday.

'We shall love her forever.'
