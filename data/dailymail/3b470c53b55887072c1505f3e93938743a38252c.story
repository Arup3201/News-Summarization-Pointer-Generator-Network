A former failed politician and Guantánamo Bay detainee, who previously employed gunman Man Haron Monis, has claimed that he could have convinced the 50-year-old to end the Sydney siege without resorting to violence.

Mamdouh Habib, who was assisted by Monis in 2007 when he sought Labor's seat in Sydney's western suburb of Auburn, told Fairfax that he knew him 'very well' and insisted that Monis was 'not violent'. Despite this show of support Monis will be buried in an undisclosed location in Melbourne after the Sydney Muslim community reportedly refused to bury him. 

'I believe this man, in this situation, prepare himself to be shot – but he doesn't want to shoot somebody. He is prepared to be killed, but he doesn't want to kill anybody,' Mr Habib, who offered police to negotiate with Monis during the siege, said.

Mamdouh Habib (pictured), who was assisted by Monis in 2007 when he sought Labor's seat in Sydney's western suburb of Auburn, said he knew Man Haron Monis 'very well' and insisted that the Sydney siege gunman was 'not violent'

Instead, he claimed Monis (pictured) was only seeking attention and was motivated by his problems with the government and his limited ability to contact his children

Instead, the wrongly accused former Guantánamo Bay detainee, who was tortured after being arrested in Pakistan under the false pretences that he'd had knowledge of the September 11 attacks, claimed Monis was only seeking attention.

Mr Habib offered to help negotiate with the gunman during the siege, and maintains that Monis, while 'sick and disturbed' was motivated by his problems with the government and his limited ability to contact his children.

He insistently told Fairfax that he believed Monis had no intention of harming any of the 18 people he took hostage at the Lindt Café in Martin Place on December 15, nor that his attack was associated with motivations linked to terrorist organisation the Islamic State.

His offer of help police negotiate with the 50-year-old was one of many put forward by other Muslim community members, including the Grand Mufti, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed. All of these are believed to have been rejected.

Mr Habib recently announced he was considering taking a second round of legal action against the Australian Government, which he claimed was compliant in his torture by the CIA, the ABC reports.

Meanwhile, Monis' body has finally been claimed by some of his anonymous acquaintances, and is to be buried somewhere in Melbourne within the next few days, according to News Corp.

It comes after claims from the Muslim community, that no Muslim funeral home would accept him as his body remained in the morgue unclaimed, days after the siege had ended.

Contrastingly, an Islamic State propaganda magazine lavished  Monis' with praise for the siege, labelling the hostage crisis a 'daring raid' and calling for more lone wolf attacks in Australia.

In the foreword to its sixth edition, the IS magazine Dabiq described Monis as a brother and said he was fighting in the path of Allah.

He did so 'by acting alone and striking the kuffar (non-believers) where it would hurt them most - in their own lands and on the very streets that they presumptively walk in safety,' the magazine states. 

'It didn't take much; he got hold of a gun and stormed a cafe taking everyone inside hostage.

'Yet in doing so, he prompted mass panic, brought terror to the entire nation ... The blessings in his efforts were apparent from the very outset.'

At the start of the siege, a black flag with Arabic writing was visible in a window of the Lindt cafe in Sydney's Martin Place.

Dabiq declared this was 'a testament to his sincerity'.

It said Monis joined other Muslims who answered a jihadist call 'to strike those waging war against the Islamic State wherever they may be'.

In October, Dabiq published calls for lone wolf attacks across western nations, especially US, UK, France, Australia and Germany.

It repeated that statement in the latest edition.

'There will be others who follow the examples set by Man Haron Monis and Numan Haider in Australia,' it said.
