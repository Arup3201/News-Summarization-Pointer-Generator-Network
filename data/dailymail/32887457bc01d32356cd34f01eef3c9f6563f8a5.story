James Milner is ready to shoulder extra responsibility at Manchester City with David Silva ruled out of the Manchester derby.

Milner, arguably City’s best player this season, may be asked by manager Manuel Pellegrini to play in a more central role with City missing Silva’s creativity against United at the Etihad Stadium.

The 28-year-old has played in nearly every outfield position during his career and would not be daunted by switching from wide to the centre if Pellegrini opts for one up front.

Milner said: ‘It doesn’t bother me where I play — I just want to be in the team. But I think my best position is in the middle and if the manager thinks I can do a job there against United then I’ll be ready.

‘I don’t know what his thoughts are but I was bought as a central midfielder and I’ve had a bit more time in there this season, though mainly I have been used wide.

‘I’d rather be in a team with David Silva than without him. He will be a massive loss for us because he is such a great player,

‘But we have got a strong squad. When one top player drops out, another one comes straight in.’

Milner would have left in the summer had Pellegrini let him but he’s been a regular for club and country this season and is now open to the idea of signing a new contract before his current one expires in the summer. 

‘I’d love to stay at City. That’s the bottom line,’ he revealed. ‘This is a club that is winning things, we have great players and the fans have always been great.

‘It’s a no-brainer for me, I would love to sign a new contract. We are talking, but there hasn’t been an actual contract offer yet.

‘Obviously I’d like things to be sorted sooner rather than later, but I’m not putting a timescale on it. At the moment, all I am thinking about is keeping my place in the team.

‘You don’t expect to play every game when you’re at a club like this, but I wanted more opportunities and the manager has given them to me.

As one of the senior voices in the dressing-room, Milner doesn’t hide that this has been an inconsistent start to the season for City.

They have already lost four times in all competitions and trail Chelsea in the League.

‘We know we’ve let our standards slip in the last couple of weeks but it hasn’t been because of a lack of effort,’ he said.

‘We have spoken about it as a group. We’re quite harsh in the way we criticise ourselves. We don’t hide behind excuses.

‘There is such a long way to go and we certainly don’t feel that anything has been won or lost yet in terms of the Premier League.

‘This is a big game for us — but it’s a big game for United as well — and it’s true what they say that sometimes form counts for nothing. If you can’t get yourself up for a Manchester derby then you’re in trouble.’
