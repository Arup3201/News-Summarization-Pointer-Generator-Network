A bumbling arson suspect is feeling the burn after he appears to have set himself on fire while trying to burn down a building in Ohio last week.

Adding significant insult to the clumsy injury is the fact that it appears that this is the second time the alleged firebug has failed to burn down the same building, a Masonic Temple in West Toledo.

And not only did the ham-handed flame-thrower set himself on fire while failing to burn down the temple, video of the entire humiliating incident was recorded by surveillance cameras - and released onto the Internet by authorities looking to track down the culprit.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Oops: The unidentified firebug tried to burn down a Masonic temple in Ohio - and managed to set himself on fire in the process

Arson: The suspect approached the building about 5 a.m. Monday with what was later determined to be a brick with a rag attached to it

According to authorities in West Toledo, the suspect attempted to burn down the Masonic temple at 5025 Secor Road about 4:56 a.m. Monday.

Surveillance cameras recorded the unidentified suspect drive up to the temple, get out of his vehicle and walk towards the building.

Shortly after the suspects walks towards the building, a burst of light is seen coming from the side of the Temple as the suspect is seen scampering away.

Bad aim: The suspect apparently was not satisfied with his first attempt to set the building on fire

Try, try again: After missing his target, the man goes back for the flaming brick to try again to set the building on fire

When the fire appears to burn out, the suspect is seen running towards the building, apparently to try again. When he backed away, the man's hand appeared to be on fire.

He then jumped in his car and drove off.

Police in West Toledo say that fire officials determined that the suspect had used a patio brick with a burning rag attached to it to break a window at the temple on the north side of the building. The rag, officials say, was found on the lawn.

See ya: After failing to burn the building down - and setting himself on fire - the bumbling firebug ran back to his car and drove off

Still standing: Authorities say the suspect did about $300 in damage to the building in what appears to be his second failed attempt to burn it down

At the end of the day, the failed flaming brick did about $300 in damage.

Authorities say someone attempted to set the same temple on fire on May 14.

An investigation is ongoing to determine who attempted to set the building on fire, and whether the two attempts are related.
