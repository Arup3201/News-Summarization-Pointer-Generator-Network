This year marks the 30th anniversary of the charity I set up with my husband Bill Travers and eldest son Will, after we appeared in the moving and highly successful film Born Free.

The true tale of Elsa the lion cub and the game wardens, George and Joy Adamson, who raised her and then released her back into the wild has inspired and delighted generations.

Over the years we have had the backing of The Mail on Sunday and its readers. To have that kind of support to make people think and care about animals is invaluable.

It was an elephant which led us to establish the charity that became the Born Free Foundation.

After the 1966 film, Bill concentrated on making wildlife films. One of them was An Elephant Called Slowly, about Pole Pole, a little female elephant who had been captured by the then Kenyan government when she was only two and given as a gift to London Zoo.

Her sad story is told below and it prompted  us to set up Zoo Check, which later became Born Free. We have spent three decades exposing the suffering of captive animals and, sadly, it is work that is as necessary today as it was  all those years ago.

We are desperate to improve the plight of more than 40 solitary elephants held in zoos and circuses in Europe. We also work with Elephant Family, the charity founded by the Duchess of Cornwall’s late brother, Mark Shand, to save the endangered Asian elephant.

I continue to visit zoos around the world to monitor the animals kept there. Where possible we try to have them removed if they are in poor condition –  or at least to improve those conditions.

When Bill and I set up Zoo Check, it was dismissed as a nine-day wonder. But today Born Free is an internationally renowned organisation with more than 100,000 supporters and a host of celebrity supporters, including Joanna Lumley, Martin Clunes, Helen Worth and Amanda Holden.

Bill died 20 years ago and our son Will is now president of Born Free. And both of us feel as strongly about the cause as we did at the start.

In the early days, I was nervous about putting forward my views because we were not scientists, and many people probably thought we didn’t know what we were talking about.

But now, because I’m old, and I know I haven’t that much time, everything is more urgent.  I’ve got to speak out. I want to be judged for what I believe in.

I still have plenty of fire and fight. This month I am publishing my first book of poetry, and I am taking a group of people to Kenya on safari. We will visit Elsa’s grave, of course, which will bring back many memories. I hope her descendants still roam the Serengeti.

But there remains a lot of unending work to  do to ensure lions still live there in the future. My dream is to create a sanctuary for elephants in solitary captivity in Europe, perhaps in Italy or the South of France.

Yesterday the Born Free Foundation lent its support to the Global March for Elephants and Rhinos. Our patrons, actress Rula Lenska, broadcaster Nicky Campbell and racing driver Darren Turner joined hundreds of members  of the public to draw attention to the 50,000 elephants killed every year for their ivory.

Shockingly, an elephant is massacred every  15 minutes for its ivory, and a rhino is killed every nine hours for its horn. Often these magnificent beasts are still alive when their tusks and horns are hacked from their faces.

Here are just a few of the Born Free Foundation’s success stories, many made possible by you. But we must do more. Won’t you join us?

Rikki, a sweet-natured leopard, was discovered in 1994 locked inside a 6ft x 6ft cage on top of a disco building in Tenerife, along with lions Raffi and Anthea. 

During his years of captivity, Rikki had suffered extreme distress caused by the barren conditions and lack of exercise. He was also suffering from poor nutrition. Rikki had been born in a travelling circus on the island before the restaurateur took him. 

Mail on Sunday readers raised thousands to free him and the campaign was joined by Janet Ward, mother of Julie Ward, the 28-year-old photographer murdered in a Kenyan game reserve in 1988. 

For five years Rikki lived in a wildlife sanctuary in Kent, run by the Born Free Foundation, before finally, in 1999, he was released into a sanctuary near Port Elizabeth in South Africa

This pair of lions were bought as cubs by a Tenerife restaurant owner as an attraction for his business. 

He also kept Rikki the leopard captive as a customer attraction (see his story below). For five years, Raffi and Anthea were incarcerated in the tiny, rusting cage perched on a sun-baked roof. 

Some reports at the time claimed they had been fed live dogs within sight of a luxurious hotel. Malnourished and frustrated, the thin and filthy lions spent their days pacing back and forth.

The Foundation launched a campaign to free them and, with the support of The Mail on Sunday, managed to rescue them in 1995. A special hotline was set up for the animals, and horrified readers of this newspaper contributed a total of nearly £60,000. 

The lions spent two years in a UK big cat sanctuary before being shipped to the Shamwari reserve where they were released and eventually reunited with Rikki, who had already been saved.

Pole Pole was only two when she was snatched from her wild family and was given as a gift from the then Kenyan government to London Zoo. 

Bill and Virginia did everything they could to stop the move but the baby elephant’s fate was sealed. In 1982 the couple went to see Pole Pole in London and were dismayed by her miserable existence. 

With no companions of her own and prematurely aged by captivity, she had become difficult to manage. 

The death of Pole Pole the elephant inspired Virginia McKenna's Zoo Check, which evolved into the Born Free Foundation

Clearly frustrated, she paced her barren enclosure. But when they called her name she stopped, turned and came to them, straining with her trunk to reach their hands. ‘It was a heartbreaking and life-changing moment,’ recalls Virginia. 

The Travers renewed their campaign to give Pole Pole a better life, but in 1983 when she was just 16 (elephants can live to over 60) she died. Determined her death would not be in vain, in 1984 the Travers launched Zoo Check, which evolved into the Born Free Foundation.

Call of the wild: Pitou the leopard is freed at last

For ten years, their home was a 20ft cage set into the cliffs of Monte Carlo. But after a five-year campaign by The Mail on Sunday and the Born Free Foundation, leopards Sirius and Pitou were set free in 2008. 

The animals were part of the Jardin Animalier, started in the 1950s by Prince Rainier. The decision to release them was taken by his son and successor Prince Albert. 

They were taken to the Shamwari reserve in South Africa, where Pitou, aged 14, set off with a roar from her cage. Sirius, 13, had to be coaxed out. 

The campaign had begun with a Mail on Sunday report that led to thousands of protest letters, which Virginia and a group of children delivered to Monaco’s consulate in London.

Today he is the star of a much viewed YouTube clip. But in 1969, Christian the lion was bought as a cub from the then Harrods pet section by two young Australians, John Rendall and Ace Bourke, for 250 guineas.C

Naming him Christian, they raised him in their flat on the Kings Road, and he became a star of swinging London. He exercised in a nearby churchyard, and the friends wrote a book about him, A Lion Called Christian.

But he grew from a 35 lb cub to a rather more imposing 185 lb adult a year later. His future was secured when he was spotted by Virginia and, with the help of George and Joy Adamson, was taken to Africa. A year later, Bourke and Rendall went to see him. 

Although warned they shouldn't approach Christian as he was now wild, the lion clearly remembered his human chums,and his exuberant delight at their reunion has become a YouTube phenomenon.
