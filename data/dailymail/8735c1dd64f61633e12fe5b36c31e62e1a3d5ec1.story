An American inventor has created a rifle attachment that replaces the scope of a gun with an iPhone.

When used with the Inteliscope app, shooters can use the iPhone scope to see detailed weather conditions, zoom into targets and peek round corners without moving using the iPhone camera.

The Idaho-based company behind the invention is now taking pre-orders for the device, which costs around £46 ($69.95) and will be shipped in June.

The Shooter Tactical Rifle Adapter from Inteliscope can be used to replace the gun's scope with an iPhone or iPod touch. The scope shows crosshairs and weather conditions, plus it comes with 5x digital zoom, a built-in GPS mapper and compass, and it lets shooters peek round corners

The Inteliscope rifle attachment comes with filters, including a night vision scope. This filter can be enabled through the app and uses the iPhone or iPod Touch's camera to take images in low-light conditions

The Inteliscope adapter system can be used to attach an iPhone or iPod Touch to any gun with either a Picatinny (Mil-STD-1913) or Weaver tactical rail, such as the Heckler & Koch HK416.

It was created by inventor Jason Gidding, who also designed the Luminae glass multi-touch keyboard and touchpad.

The Inteliscope device was developed within 10 weeks. 

The Inteliscope is made of high-strength plastic with a rubber case.

The rifle attachment can also be moved along the barrel and switched between portrait and landscape.

The Inteliscope rifle adapter works with the iPod Touch, iPhone 4 and 4S, and the iPhone 5. It can be fitted to any firearm that has Picatinny (Mil-STD-1913) or Weaver tactical rail, such as the Heckler & Koch HK416. It is adjustable and can switch from portrait to landscape

A quick-release portable cover protects the  iPhone or iPod from the weather, as well as damage caused by impact.

The scope has a camera that can be moved by the shooter's thumb.

Images shown on the scope are taken using the built-in camera on the iPhone or iPod Touch.

This
 camera, when used with the app, also makes it possible for shooters to 
look and shoot round corners without having to move or reveal their 
position. 

The scope has a 5X digital zoom, crosshairs, a built-in GPS mapper and compass.

The Inteliscope app also comes with a red dot scope filter. When this filter is enabled a red dot becomes an aimpoint for shooters. It is used to improve shot accuracy and is common in police and military weapons

It can also show weather conditions, including wind speeds and direction. 

Shooters can additionally use the scope to record video and play it back, as well as time shots using the built-in timer.

The Inteliscope firearm adapter and iOS app is available for pre-order and will be shipped in June.

All three adapters for the iPod Touch, iPhone 4 and 4S and iPhone 5 cost around £46 ($69.95) plus postage.
