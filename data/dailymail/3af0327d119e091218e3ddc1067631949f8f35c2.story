SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO...

Crunch time: It was crunch time on the X Factor 
tonight, as the final three finalists, left to right Chris Rene, Melanie Amaro and Josh Krajcik had their last chances to wow both
the judges and the public

Crowd pleasers: All three finalists had the judges jumping up and down in their seats

Josh Krajcik performed with Alanis Morissette, Chris Rene did a duet with Avril Lavigne and Melanie Amaro took to the stage with R. Kelly.    

Krajcik, 30, opened the show, singing Morisette's hit Uninvited, from the hit soundtrack to the 1998 film City of Angels.

The audience was shocked and surprised when Alanis actually joined the Columbus, Ohio native on stage to power through the harmonies.

Electric: Krajcik, 30, opened the show, singing Alanis Morissette's hit Uninvited, from the hit soundtrack to the 1998 film City of Angels

Hugs: Following the performance, the Grammy-Award winning singer praised Krajcik, saying that he was a 'very soulful man'

'Ladies and gentleman, I cannot believe ‭I am inviting to the stage, the amazing Alanis Morrisette,' Krajcik yelled through the microphone, beaming.

Clearly
a little shaky at first, he sang along with the 37-year-old Canadian 
singer, the two going in and out of the verses together. 

Following the performance, the Grammy-Award winning singer praised Krajcik, saying that he was a 'very soulful man'.

'Wow, that was surreal,' judge L.A. Reid exclaimed.' It was such a natural pairing, for you to sing with Alanis Morrisette.'

Two peas in a pod: Next up with was Chris Rene and pop star Avril Lavigne, who performed her hit song Complicated together in matching leather

Owning the stage: Chris as always looked at home on the stage, rapping up a storm to cheers from the crowd

'I couldn't think of a better way to 
open this competition tonight,' added Paula Abdul. 'Not only did you 
hold your own, you but you kept your identity, dignity and integrity.'

But Simon wasn't as impressed, pointing out that he thought Krajcik was intimidated by Alanis.

'Josh I thought you were a little bit intimidated at the beginning... but it was an eight out of 10,' he said in a lukewarm tone.

But Krajcik's mentor Nicole Scherzinger refuted Simon's claims, telling Josh that 'the sign of a true artist is acknowledging the other person you're singing with. It shows how wonderful and generous you are as an artist.'

Close: Also cosy with her superstar singer, was Simon Cowell's finalist Melanie Amaro who did a duet with R'n'B legend R. Kelly 

Thrilled: It was the first time R. Kelly has ever let someone duet the song with him

Next up with was Chris Rene and Avril Lavigne, who performed her hit song Complicated together in matching leather.

'Ladies and Gentleman, the moment you have been waiting for, Avril Lavigne,' Rene said motivating the already roaring audience.

Like a teenage girl Avril was jumping up and down at the sidelines, clearly eager to get on stage with Rene.

The pair were like two peas in a pod with Avril even doing some rapping with Rene.

'That was kick a**. Chris is amazing. I think everyone should vote for him!' Avril said of Rene following the performance.

'It was a little shaky in the take off, but you came out on top... By the end your energy was so flipping infectious. You shined up there!' Nicole praised. 

Laughs: Judges L.A Reid and Nicole Scherzinger had a few laughs on the night

Fights: As always Simon Cowell and Paula Abdul were at loggerheads during the night

'You just sang with Avril Lavigne... What a wonderful, current, feel-good performance,' Paula gushed.

Simon said he thought that Rene looked comfortable throughout the performance.

'When it kicked in, I felt your total joy and confidence... And that would be a record,' he said.

L.A agreed, saying his protege: 'looked really at home with Avril.'

You guys looked like you were cut from the same cloth,' he said. 'I agree with Simon; that could be a record that we could cut tomorrow, and it would be a big hit.'

Classic: Krajcik used his soulful vocals to do a rendition of Etta James classic At Last for his second performance 

Going wild: Fans from his hometown in Wooster, Ohio were going nuts for the 30-year-old

Also cosy with her superstar singer was Simon Cowell's finalist Melanie Amaro.

The 19-year-old from Florida held hands with R. Kelly as they performed his hit power ballad, I Believe I Can Fly, the first time he has ever allowed someone to duet the song with him.

Following the performance, Kelly had nothing but praise for the diva in the making, telling the judges and audience members that 'There's no doubt in my mind this girl is on her way to the moon.'

Considering she was singing with one of R'n'B's legends, L.A still thought that Melanie shouldn't have been outshined as much by Kelly.

'If I am to be honest (and you know that I love you), I felt like you got a little bit overshadowed by R. Kelly. I expect more from you,' he said.

Celebration: Rene did an updated version of his rap Young Homie, celebrating eight months of sobriety just yesterday

Tears: The rapper broke down in tears following the judges remarks about his performance

'I think that she did the best that she could. She put a thousand percent into that performance,' argued Nicole.

And Simon had nothing but praise for his protege.

'I wouldn't listen to grumpy and dumpy over there (referring to L.A)... to me that was an incredible duet,' he said.

'You didn't look like someone in a talent competition, you looked like someone that could be a really important and established artist.'

For the second round the contestants went back to solo, singing their signature sounds that they have best become renown for.

Krajcik, Rene, Amaro all sang their songs from their original auditions.

So proud: Rene's mother had a cake with the words 'believe' emblazoned across the front as she watched from his hometown of Santa Cruz, California

Krajcik used his soulful vocals to do a rendition of Etta James classic, At Last, throwing in some guitar playing for good measure.

On the LED-lit stage, all of the judges thought he looked at home on the stage.

'I am so proud man, you look so at home up there man... You are such a rock star,' L.A said. 'You took your guitar and made it your own.'

'You owned that stage.' praised Paula. 'Great job tonight.'

Stunning: Last but not least was Amaro, who 
belted out the Beyonce classic Listen in a stunning sequined fish tail 
dress to deafening cheers from the audience

More waterworks: Amaro also required a tissue following her performance

Nicole said that Krajcik and music were at one.

'From day one, you have delivered every single performance. Music loves you,' she gushed. 'I am so proud of you!'

Rene did an updated version of his rap Young Homie, celebrating eight months of sobriety just yesterday.

Simon was blown away, telling Rene, 'That was your five-million-dollar song!

'We all have a purpose in life, and you are serving your purpose right now with that song,' Nicole gushed. 'That is yours and our belief anthem.'

Paula
was even more enthused, jumping up and down screaming 'Vote!' to the audience.

'You make every one fall in love with you!' she screamed.

Deafening: At her church in Sunrise, Florida the crown was deafening as they cheered on Amaro

Last but not least was Amaro who 
belted out the Beyonce classic Listen in a stunning sequined fish tail 
dress which was followed by deafening cheers from the audience.  

'Melanie, that is the Melanie I love 
right there,' L.A said. 'That wasn't a five million dollar performance, 
that was a 50 million dollar performance.'

'Melanie you empowered me and that is what music is all about right there,' Nicole said fighting back tears.

Waiting
to hear their fate: The three will find out who will go home with the 
$5 million prize money and a Pepsi commercial tomorrow night

Fashion face-off: Nicole and Paula both slipped into futuristic style dresses for the exciting evening

Simon simply cut to the chase telling her that in his eyes she was already the winner.

'You, to me, should be the winner of X Factor,' he said.

All three finalists will find out who
will go home with the $5 million prize money and a Pepsi commercial 
tomorrow night in the final results show.
