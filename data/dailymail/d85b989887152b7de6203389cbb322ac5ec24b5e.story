While the rest of New York is complaining about the freezing snow, Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig turned winter into something magical in their latest Marchesa show at the New York Public Library yesterday evening.

Inspired by 'visions of billowing bonfires sweeping through the Scottish Highlands', there was a sense of faded grandeur in the hand-embroidered wool, deconstructed kilt dresses and tartan lace.

Katie Holmes, Tyra Banks, Ireland Baldwin, Sarah Paulson, Anna Kendrick and Olivia Palermo made for an elegant front row as the label sent gown after sumptuous gown down the runway.

Showstopping: The finale gown at the Marchesa show yesterday was a saffron-gold silk faille ballgown. The fabric was embroidered at the waist with copper floral 3D ribbon, and the sculptural neckline was set off the shoulder to expose the decolletage

As always with Marchesa, the garments were couture-like in their construction. A crystal-and-ribbon-embroidered cocktail dress of cream wool - so fine it was almost transparent - seemed to float rather than hang on the model. Heavily-embellished dresses were draped with the world's most lavish argyle-knit 'cardigans', amped-up with fox fur, ostrich feathers - and of course plenty more of that intricate beading.

The cocktail numbers were largely inspired by the kilt and flashed sexy glimpses of leg. There was even a pair of lace-up trousers - a rarity for Marchesa, which specializes in statement dresses.

These soon gave way to evening gowns - the pieces de resistance - with full 'broomstick-pleated' skirts, dramatic trains and corseted waists.

The finale gown, a saffron-gold silk 
faille ballgown, showed this to best effect. The fabric was embroidered

A blood red silk evening gown referenced Scotland's chilly climes in the styling - beneath the Angelina-worthy leg-slit were buckled Christian Louboutin boots in lieu of the lace-up platform pumps we saw on so many other other looks.

Indeed, the shoes were something special. A
 collaboration with Christian Louboutin, they boasted concave wedge 
heels that almost gave the impression that the models were balancing on pointe like ballerinas.

The palette was a rich, moody one, as the show notes explained.

'Marchesa's Fall 2014 collection is guided through an ombre of fiery 
flames and smoky fog. Bursts of teal, cinnamon, saffron and copper hues 
give way to silver, blush and cream,' they read.

This concept was borne from personal experience, Ms Chapman explained backstage to the Associated Press.

'We have a lot of bonfires so we were looking at the fire and the smoke and we took a lot of the colors from the bonfires,' she said.

She and Ms Craig said that they were 'deconstructing Scotland,' in playing with tartan and the pleating in kilts.

And already, the collection has been receiving rave reviews from those in attendance. Ireland Baldwin was quick to Instagram her favorite looks, deeming the entire show 'phenomenal'.

'I am honored to have attended,' she added.
