Large tote bags and girly clutches are so last season at Louis Vuitton. Their new  fall/winter 14-15 collection, designed by the fashion house's hottest new property, Nicolas Ghesquiere, was unveiled today at Paris Fashion Week.

Models took to the catwalk carrying the Petite-Malle which is as innovative as it is distinctive.

The rectangular shaped bags are carried with a long leather strap that clips on to the sides. A fold over lid top, clasps and buckles give the appearance of a traditional vanity case or treasure chest.

In disguise: The bag can be covered in fabric to hide it's boxy appearance and sharp edges

For those who want a bag that looks more like a bag, a fabric cover can be attached giving the product a softer appearance and covering the sharp edges.

Fashionistas have already given the designs the seal of approval toting the Petite-Malle to be the IT bag of the year.

Harper's Bazaar praised Ghesqui√©re for 'creating the must-have bag of the season on his first outing for the fashion house' while style.com said it's like having 'a miniature LV trunk' at your fingertips.

The price of the bag has not been revealed as it is currently only available "on demand" and is not currently on sale via the fashion house's website.

But one lucky lady who already has her hands on it is Natalia Vodianova. The pregnant supermodel showed off her accessory along with her baby bump as she arrived to sit on the front row of the Paris show.

blonde hair swept back away from her face.

'As the Louis Vuitton show notes stated: "Today is a new day. A big day",' says fashion expert Simon Glazin.

'Nicolas Ghesquiere, formally of Balenciaga, wrote them to welcome the 1000-strong audience witnessing his first collection for the fashion house that Marc Jacobs built.

'And it certainly was a new dawn. The first few looks had something uniquely Nicolas about them. His hand at turning a skirt or a zip-up into something uber cool translated here. Tiny waists were exaggerated with twisted belts and statement pockets - both features present throughout most of the collection.

'Emphasis on necklines meant you looked from top-to-bottom of each look, which, for a designer, is something you hope for from eager editors. Big winged collars, roll-necks and plunged lines were all there.

'Something resolutely 70s was the 
undertone to this collection. Thick floral prints, A-line shapes and 
various rich brown hues that remind me of Abigail's Party.

'A
 fabulous mix of textures - another technique that Nicolas brings with 
him from his Balenciaga years - created some stand-out pieces: those 
leather and tweed dresses (celebrity frocks for sure) and the shine of 
patent teamed with the matte of a roll-neck jumper.

'What we got here was something fresh and cool. Marc bought the glamour and sequins, Nicolas brings the future'

Sexy leather and deep plunge necklines also took centre stage as sixties and seventies hues reigned supreme
