They say hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. But try telling that to this man, who used the front of his house to share a very public message to his ex.

Robin Baker, 45, tied a homemade sign from an upstairs window after finding his estranged wife had stripped the property of all their belongings.

The truck driver is in the process of divorcing his wife of 22 years, Jeanette Baker, 47, with whom he has three grown-up children.

Acrimonious: Lorry driver Robin Baker, 45, has publicly vented his feelings towards his estranged wife on a homemade sign on the front of his house

A man scorned: The angry message was painted in bold black letters and hung up outside a house near Coalville, in Leicestershire

He said the pair mutually agreed to 
end their relationship in April last year.But he claims he came home 
last week to find the semi-detached property in Coalville, 
Leicestershire, empty – with even the curtains and curtain rails 
missing.

Mr Baker said even the plants in the back garden of their £127,000 home had been uprooted and removed by his soon-to-be ex-wife.

So, in an act of revenge, he used thick black paint to scrawl a message on a 6ft by 4ft sheet.

The sign, which he has hung on the 
front of the three-bedroom house, declares: ‘Woman you stripped this 
house bare. I proved you a liar in court. Your [sic] getting **** all.’

He said he put up the banner to ‘inspire’ other men who have found themselves in the same situation.

And he insisted he would rather have the home repossessed than see part of its value going to his estranged wife.

When the former couple agreed to split, Mr Baker continued to live in the property and his wife moved out.

But last week, he was shocked when he 
returned home to find that the house had been completely emptied. He 
claimed: ‘Her and her family had taken literally everything, they hadn’t
 even left me a teaspoon.

‘The curtains were gone, the curtain 
rails were gone, even the plants from the garden had gone. I rang the 
police but there’s nothing they could do because it was domestic.

‘I thought I would put this sign up to show her that she wasn’t getting anything.’

He added: ‘It’s our house but I paid 
the mortgage and paid everything. I wanted to prove to other blokes that
 they don’t have to let their ex walk all over them.’

Mr Baker said that ever since he put 
the banner outside his upstairs front window, total strangers have been 
queuing up to congratulate him.

He said: ‘It’s had a great reaction. Strangers stop so they can take pictures and beep their horns. I get it all day.

‘One bloke even knocked the door and 
said he just wanted to shake my hand and say he had been through a 
similar thing and thought it was great.

‘She wants half of the house but I’d sooner get it repossessed than her have some of it.

‘The sign is to support every bloke in this country whose ex has tried to walk all over them.’

One of Mr Baker’s neighbours said: 
‘It’s one way of putting his point across I suppose. I think he’s a 
little bit upset.’ She added: ‘I’ve never seen anything like it before.

‘I think he wants to get his message across in a big way. It is quite eye-catching.’

Sources close to Mrs Baker denied that she had stripped the house of all their shared belongings.

When approached yesterday, she turned 
down the chance to explain her side of the story to avoid jeopardising 
the pair’s ongoing divorce proceedings.

But she did say: ‘If he is  mentioning anything like that then I will be taking it further.’

Mr Baker is due to face his wife in court later this month to finalise the divorce and decide how to split their equity.
