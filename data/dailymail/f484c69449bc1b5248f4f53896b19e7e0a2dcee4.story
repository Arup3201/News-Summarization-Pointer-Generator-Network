A couple have told how they were left fighting for their lives after being repeatedly stabbed in the head by a  guest at their own house-warming party as they slept,

Today Rob Plevin and Sally Roythorne, from Cumbria, look like any other healthy couple happily posing with their new baby, Poppy. 

But in May 2010 the pair were left with catastrophic injuries after friend Matthew Lucas crept into their room while they were sleeping and stabbed them both in the head.

Ms Roythorne suffered 18 wounds to her head and face and had a punctured lung. The ligaments in her hands had been so badly damaged while she was trying to protect herself from the blows of Lucas' knife that she spent three months with them in plaster casts.

Doctors did not expect them to survive the horrific ordeal. Ms Roythorne suffered 18 wounds to her head and face and had a punctured lung, while Mr Plevin was stabbed twice through the neck. 

His life was only saved by the quick thinking of other guests who tried to stem the bleeding, but after emerging from a two day coma, he lost so much blood that he had a full blood transfusion and required seven hours in surgery.

The ligaments in Ms Roythorne's hands had been so badly damaged while she was trying to protect herself from the blows of Lucas' knife that she spent three months with them in plaster casts.

At the time, a court heard that the couple had been celebrating their move from Newcastle to Cumbria, with a party of 30 friends on May 23 2010. 

The couple and a few guests who were staying over headed to bed not long after midnight once the party was over. 

But chef Lucas, 39 at the time, went into their kitchen, took a knife and crept up to their bedroom to attack them, with absolutely no warning or apparent reason. The court heard at the time that he had approached several different women at the party but his advances had been turned down each time.

Mr Plevin had known Lucas for around 10 years. They had first met through a friend and had seen each other intermittently over the years, mainly on canoeing trips in Scotland with mutual friends.

He said: 'In the run up to the party he had checked with us if any single women were going to be there - he was frustrated that he was still single.

'We knew that he was also pretty stressed out at work and that money was a bit of an issue for him, but we'd thought that our party would just be a chance to relax.'

'But the thought never crossed my mind that he would be violent.'

When the case finally came to an end and Lucas was given an indeterminate jail sentence with a 13-year minimum tariff.

Ms Roythorne said: 'We'd moved from Newcastle to Cumbria to be closer to Rob's parents, who were unwell, and had invited lots of friends to celebrate the new chapter in our lives.

'The house was a stunning four-bedroom detached former Police superintendent's home with a huge garden so we'd had a barbeque and been playing games all afternoon - we even played rounders on the village green.'

She added: 'Our physical injuries were only a fraction of what we experienced. It was the mental horror, the post-traumatic stress which caused us the most pain and anguish.

'When we woke up in hospital after the attack we were shocked that we were even alive - the doctors hadn't expected us to make it.

'We came round and just looked at each other with tears streaming down our faces.

'One thing that gave us relief in the very tough times was the idea of us both floating on a raft, letting go of all the anxiety and things we couldn't control - just 'going with the flow'.

The couple have since set up The Life Raft, an organisation to share what they had learnt overcoming their experience and to help others.

Ms Roythorne said: 'Before the attack, Rob and I were both very career-driven. We both had older children from previous relationships and we'd never even considered having a child together.

'But our long road to recovery made us re-evaluate our lives.

'We started meditating and we realised we wanted to refocus our lives around our family instead of our careers, and we had Poppy in 2014.

'She has been a little angel that arrived to finish of the healing process.

'If we hadn't have nearly died that night, we wouldn't be nearly as happy as we are today.' 

'It's been a long, long road to recovery but we're proud to say that our lives are better now than they were before that evening.

'It was a blessing in disguise and has given us a second chance at life.'
