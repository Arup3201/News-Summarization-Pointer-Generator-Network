Alexis Sanchez was afforded a well-deserved night out after firing Arsenal into the Champions League group stages.

The Chile star notched on the stroke of half-time during a nervy one-goal win against Beskitas at the Emirates.

And Sanchez, who cost Arsenal £30million from Barcelona in the summer, celebrated his first goal for the Gunners at London nightclub Chinawhite.

That's better! Sanchez notched his first goal for the Gunners in the win against Beskitas 

The 25-year-old’s role in the Arsenal side – whether he plays wide or centrally - has been up for debate over the last week.

But Sanchez indicated to manager Arsene Wenger that he is able to operate through the middle in the absence of Olivier Giroud.

The Frenchman is set to miss the next four months after surgery on a broken tibia but Wenger isn’t unduly worried.

'Sanchez can play his whole life at centre forward,' said the Arsenal boss. 'I bought him as a striker, not only to play on the flanks. He had a good game. He was mobile, dangerous and has shown as well he has great fighting spirit, qualities that will be very important in the Premier League.

'He produced the performance we wanted, technically, tactically and mentally. We needed that against a good team. It was nervous in the last 10 minutes when we were down to 10 men.'

Sanchez wasn't the only sporting superstar that enjoyed himself at the Chinawhite club on Wednesday night after sprint king Usain Bolt also made his way to the London nightspot.

Beaming for the cameras after dining with his friends at trendy London restaurant Nozomi, Bolt was wearing a floral shirt and donned a baseball cap and sunglasses before he headed to Chinawhite.

The world's fastest man was also showing off on Instagram, posting a video of himself performing a bizarre rap.

Still wearing the baseball cap, it seems as if the Jamaican superstar is better at sprinting than he is at flowing lyrics.

Bolt was due to run in the Diamond League meeting in Zurich this week, but pulled out due to injury as a result bringing his season to an early end.

The six-time Olympic champion, who will resume training in October, will be looking to retain his world 100m and 200m crowns at the World Championships in Beijing next year.
