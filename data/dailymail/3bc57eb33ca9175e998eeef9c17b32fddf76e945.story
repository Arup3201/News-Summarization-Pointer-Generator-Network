Sources told NBC News in New York that police were called on Thursday night by the doorman, who reported Bynes was smoking marijuana in the lobby of her building on West 47th Street.

Officers responding to the call went to Bynes' apartment where sources said they noted a 'heavy smell of marijuana and smoke'.

The
 officers were allowed inside by the actress and when they noticed a bong - a 
device used to smoke marijuana - Bynes allegedly threw it out of the 
high-rise window in full view of the policemen.

Her actions led to the further charges - under New York state law, reckless endangerment occurs when a person 
creates a substantial risk of serious physical injury to another person.

Nobody was injured by the falling bong.

Following her treatment at Roosevelt 
Hospital, Bynes was taken to a Midtown police station where she is 
expected to spend the night before a Friday court appearance.

Bynes was photographed in police custody on Thursday night as an officer escorted her out of a police station.

The actress was wearing her platinum blonde hair extensions and a black Versace sweatshirt.

Legal trouble: Amanday Bynes, shown smoking a hand-rolled cigarette in New York City in April, was arrested on Thursday night on charges of marijuana possession

The former Nickelodeon star has
 been exhibiting erratic behaviour of late with some eyebrow-raising 
public outings and online postings.

Two men who claimed they attended an
 impromptu house party at Bynes' Manhattan apartment last month said 
they witnessed Bynes smoking marijuana atop a bare mattress in her 
bedroom.

The men told 
In Touch magazine in an article this week that Bynes' home was filthy 
and filled with marijuana, presenting photos to back up their claims.

The men said that Bynes' home was virtually unfurnished and windows were spray painted black.

Bynes jumped to her own defense on Wednesday night on Twitter. She posted a tweet saying: 'That’s not my bed! Those aren’t my toes! My toes are pedicured!'

In another strange incident, TMZ 
reported on Thursday that Bynes was stopped from boarding a private jet 
last weekend for not having correct identification.

Child star: Amanda, shown in April 2001 at the Nickelodeon Kid's Choice Awards, had successful television shows in the late 1990s early 2000s

Since her driver's license has been 
suspended and she had no other form of ID, the actress told the pilot to
 search her name on Google to prove her identity.

The pilot 
checked with the jet company, but they were adamant that no special 
treatment be given and Bynes was not allowed on the flight.

Her bizarre antics commenced with her retirement from acting and move last year to New York.

The
 27-year-old is regularly on Twitter and has sent out some concerning 
tweets in which she asked Drake to 'murder her vagina' and posed topless
 while complaining about her weight.

Movie star: Amanda starred in the 2003 film What A Girl Wants with Colin Firth

The All That actress was arrested in 
April 2012 in West Hollywood, California on driving under the influence of alcohol after the black BMW she was driving struck a Los Angeles
 County Sheriff's Department patrol vehicle.

Bynes
 also has been on probation for driving on a suspended license related 
to an incident in Burbank, California in 2012 in which her car was 
impounded.

TMZ reported 
earlier this year Amanda was evicted from her apartment for being a 
'building nuisance,' as neighbours complained about smelling marijuana 
smoke from her abode.

The 
Easy A actress moved to the Big Apple to become a fashion designer last 
year, but the fruits of her labour have yet to surface.

She also didn't have much luck with her 2007 clothing line, Dear, after retailer Steve & Barry's filed for bankruptcy.
