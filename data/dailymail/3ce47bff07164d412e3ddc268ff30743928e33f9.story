Inmates at an Alabama women's 
prison have been raped, sodomized and sexually abused by guards and in some 
instances allegedly forced to perform sex acts to obtain basic sanitary 
supplies, a U.S. Department of Justice report released on Wednesday revealed.

The report was the 
result of a year-long investigation into conditions at the Julia 
Tutwiler Prison for Women, which is located in central Alabama and holds
 more than 900 inmates. It is also home to the only death row for women 
in the state.

'The women at Tutwiler universally fear for their 
safety,' federal officials wrote in a 36-page letter to Alabama Governor
 Robert Bentley.

Julia Tutwiler prison for women in Wetumpka Alabama has widespread sexual abuse of female inmates, a new report has found, including guards having sex with prisoners, watching them shower and organizing strip shows

A horrifying catalog of abuse at Tutwiler prison  is outlined in the DOJ report, including:

'They live 
in a sexualized environment with repeated and open sexual behavior 
including: abusive sexual contact between staff and prisoners, 
sexualized activity, including a strip show condoned by staff,' the 
report said.

Around a third of employees at Tutwiler have had sex with female inmate, it was reported. 

The report found that allegations of sexual abuse are 'grossly under-reported' because of inmates' fear of retaliation.

Dozens of inmates were interviewed as part of the investigation and 233 letters were received from women currently serving time at the prison.

Roughly a quarter of the prison population reported abuse including sexual harassment, dehumanizing behavior, excessive use of force and inadequate medical care.

Multiple women over several years made similar abuse allegations - which were backed up by some current and former staff.

The Alabama Department of Corrections is failing to protect the 
prison's inmates in violation of their constitutional rights, the 
Justice Department said.

'We 
conclude that the State of Alabama violates the Eighth Amendment of the 
United States Constitution by failing to protect women prisoners at 
Tutwiler from harm due to sexual abuse and harassment from correctional 
staff,' the letter said.

The DOJ added: 'The Alabama Department
 of Corrections and Tutwiler have demonstrated a clear and deliberate 
indifference to the harm and substantial risk of harm to women 
prisoners.

'Officials 
have been on notice for over eighteen years of the risks... and, for 
over eighteen years have chosen to ignore them.'

In 2007, a federal study found that Tutwiler was the women's prison with the highest rate of sexual assaults in the nation.

Kim 
Thomas, Alabama's corrections commissioner, said the state has been 
working to improve conditions at the prison and outlined a 58-point 
action plan he said he implemented last year.

'We are actively 
combating and correcting issues of concern at Tutwiler,' he said. 'We 
absolutely will not tolerate any inappropriate behavior.'

The DOJ noted that the prison's new warden was not there 'when much of the alleged misconduct took place'.

Under Alabama law, it is a Class C felony for 'any employee to engage in sexual conduct with a person who is in the custody of the Department of Corrections'.

The report was delivered last week to Governor Bentley. In comments to local 
media, he has said he was not surprised by the results of the 
investigation and said the state had been aware of the problems at the 
prison.

Justice Department 
officials said their report was based on interviews with dozens of 
prisoners during a visit to the facility in April.

Investigators also received more than 200 letters from prisoners, 
roughly a quarter of Tutwiler's prison population at the time, detailing
 a range of inmates' concerns about sexual abuse and harassment, 
according to the report.

'These problems have been festering for 
years and are well known to Alabama prison officials,' acting Assistant 
Attorney General Jocelyn Samuels said in a statement.

The Justice Department said it plans to expand its investigation to 
examine allegations of excessive use of force, constitutionally 
inadequate conditions of confinement and prisoner health care.

Bryan Stevenson, executive director of Equal Justice Initiative, a 
nonprofit legal firm in Montgomery, Alabama, said he hoped the report 
would prod state officials to move more quickly to reform the prison.

'Too little has been done to correct the problems,' he said.

Tutwiler prison opened in 1942 and was named after Julia Tutwiler, an advocate for improvement of prison conditions, whose nickname was 'Angel of the Stockades'.
