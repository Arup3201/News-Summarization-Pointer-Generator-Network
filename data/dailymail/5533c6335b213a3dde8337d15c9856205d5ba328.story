Anti-drugs lessons in schools may encourage pupils to try illegal substances rather than steer clear of them, Government experts have warned.

The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs said there was evidence that raising awareness could be counter-productive.

Its report said prevention classes that have been taught for generations were ‘ineffective at changing behaviour’ and ‘may even increase the risk of drug use’.

The board, which hit the headlines in 2009 after its then-chairman Professor David Nutt was fired for suggesting that alcohol and tobacco were more harmful than many illegal drugs, passed its findings to Home Secretary Theresa May last month, the Daily Telegraph reported.

It urged the government to cut funding unless there is good evidence that anti-drugs initiatives, such as 2003’s ‘Talk to Frank’ campaign are working. 

The report also said that hard-hitting school talks by policemen may make drugs appear ‘sexy’ to teenagers, while adverts that intended to conjure a ‘fear’ of drugs were also criticised as potentially counter-productive.

Many schools have already switched to behaviour-led measures that help children to avoid peer pressure, but experts have urged for faster and more wide-covering progress.

However, the report does concede that there is growing evidence of the importance of teaching drug prevention as part of a broader strategy to improve national health.

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Preventing and reducing drug misuse is a key part of our drug strategy and there are positive signs our approach is working.

‘There has been a long term downward trend in drug use over the last decade, the number of heroin and crack cocaine users in England continues to decline, and more people are recovering from their dependency now than in 2009-10.

‘Our evidence-based approach recognises the importance of having a range of prevention initiatives to give individuals the confidence to resist drugs. We welcome the ACMD’s advice on this important issue.’
