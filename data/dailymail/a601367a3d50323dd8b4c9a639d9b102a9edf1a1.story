The son of firebrand Islamist cleric Abu Hamza was leader of a gang who kidnapped a man and tortured him over a £15,000 debt.

Tito Ibn Sheikh, 28, was jailed for 12 years after a jury agreed he 'orchestrated the violence' inflicted on restaurant worker Hassan Monawwer over three days.

Mr Monawwer was knifed, strangled almost to death and battered with a metal bar and wooden cosh in three separate locations before armed police burst in to save him.

Family values: Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri, whose son Tito Ibn Sheikh was jailed for 12 years for kidnapping and torturing a restaurant worker said to have owed £15,000 to his friend

Sheikh, who is one of nine children of Hamza, was convicted last year, but a judge banned reports on his family ties to avoid prejudicing jurors.

But last week after he and an accomplice unsuccessfully appealed their convictions the court lifted the gag allowing him to be named the the circumstances of the case revealed.

Sheikh and friends Adam Abed and Mostafa Dawoud snatched Mr Monawwer in Acton, west London, in 2012. 

They subjected him to an ordeal of violence over £15,000 he was said to owe to Abed, the Sun on Sunday reports.

Yet in an effort to extort even more money, the trio told his family they would sell him to another gang unless they came up with £25,000 ransom.

Prosecutors said: 'His neck was squeezed so hard he thought his tongue would pop out.'

Scammers: Hamza Mustafa Kamel, Mohamed Kamel Mostafa and Mohssin Ghailan, the three sons of jailed hook-handed cleric Abu Hamza who exploited a loophole in the vehicle registration system to steal luxury cars

Hamza, 58, has nine children – six sons, two daughters and a stepson. Five of his sons are now known to have criminal records.

Mohammed Kamel Mostafa, Hamza's eldest son, was jailed for plotting to blow up British tourists. He was accused of masterminding a plot to sabotage economic and tourist sites in Yemen in August 1999, when he was just 17.

He returned to London in January 2002 after serving three years in prison in the Arab state. Six years later he was jailed again, along with his brother Hamza Mustafa Kamel and their step-brother Mohssin Ghailam.

Imran Mostafa was jailed after being convicted of armed robbery and illegal possession of a firearm over a raid on a jewellers in King's Lynn, Norfolk.

The trio operated a £1million luxury car scam which involved exploiting a DVLA loophole to steal BMW, Mercedes and other luxury brand cars, which they then either sold on or used as collateral to make fraudulent loans.

Although they were investigated by anti-terror police there was no evidence they used the cash for terrorist purposes. 'They just used the cash to party,' a source said at the time. 

In 2012, another of Hamza's sons, Imran Mostafa, was jailed after being convicted of armed robbery and illegal possession of a firearm over a smash and grab raid on a jewellers in King's Lynn, Norfolk. 

Hamza himself faces life in jail in the U.S. after he was convicted of 11 terrorism charges. Meanwhile, his second wife Najat Mostafa, 55, mother of seven of his children, lives in a £1.25million five-bedroom council house in Shepherd’s Bush, West London.
