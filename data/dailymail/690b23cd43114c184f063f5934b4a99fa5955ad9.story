She may be one of South America's finest exports, but Luisana Lopilato has decided that when it comes to the 2012 Olympic Games her loyalties belong firmly with the Brits.

The Argentinian model wife of singer Michael Buble has shown her support for Team GB by appearing in a set of British-themed sports lingerie pictures for UK underwear label Ultimo.

Eagle eyed readers will notice that there's something a little unreal about the pictures, and not just the blonde's incredible figure.

Ultimo have confirmed that the Union Jack flags have been added with a bit of computer wizadry.

But any friend of Team GB's is a friend of ours, and it would be a crime not to share Luisana's enthusiasm for our national team.

And the brand promise to put the set in to production if there's enough demand.

Michelle Mone OBE said: 'We’re 
proud to be a British brand and will be cheering on Team GB all the way 
in the London Olympics.

'Luisana looks phenomenal in the shots; she 
loves sport and keeping fit so this look really suits her! I’m sure if 
posing in lingerie were an Olympic sport Luisana would win gold.'

Flaunting her size eight figure and 34D bust in the shots Lopilato proves why she was chosen as the latest 'face and 
body' of the brand.

The 24-year-old is the first to admit it takes 
hard work and Olympic dedication to maintain her gold-standard frame.

She says: 'I work out
 everyday. I run for at least 30 minutes and play tennis. It's important 
for me to be fit and healthy.'

Lopilato has certainly been pulling her weight at Ultimo since joining the brand.

Barely a week goes by without her appearing in one of their new creations, and she was recently seen modelling the brand's stunning new diamante line, and a set of Oriental-inspired gel-fitted bras and girly briefs, available in both fuschia pink and black.

The model, who is a successful actress in 
her home country of Argentina, signed up as the face of Ultimo for a 
two-year stint in October last year.

Since
 then, sales have rocketed by 37 per cent - a spike that Ultimo founder 
and CEO Michelle Mone attributes in part to the Lopilato effect.

Uliitmo founder Michelle Mone says: 'Michael Buble¿s wife Luisana is one of our biggest international stars, and the response we have had has been phenomenal'

When Michelle Mone was awarded an OBE
 in 2010 for her services to business, she gave thanks to Luisana and 
the other Ultimo models, including Tamara Ecclestone and Amy Childs, who both modelled 
for the brand in 2011.

And when she promised that 2012 would be even bigger, she was not wrong.

At the time, she said: 'This year we 
have unveiled some amazing images designed to best showcase our 
collections and it has been fantastic to be involved with some 
incredible women.

'Michael Buble’s wife Luisana is one of our biggest international stars, 
and the response we have had has been phenomenal.

'It
 took me a long time to get her but I refused to give up. Luisana is a 
natural beauty and I'm delighted to have her on board for two years.'

The
 24-year-old actress has over one million followers on Twitter, and has 
massive global appeal - and on a very superficial level, it is not hard 
to see why.
