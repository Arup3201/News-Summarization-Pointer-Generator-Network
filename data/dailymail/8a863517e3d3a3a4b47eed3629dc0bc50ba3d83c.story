When Heston Blumenthal turned his skills to the Christmas pudding, the result was a sell-out sensation with buyers scrambling to pay a fortune on eBay.

Now, he has delivered his take on the Easter Egg in a limited edition creation that comes with a surprise nest of tiny eggs on edible paper in the middle.

Only 8,000 of the £20 hand-crafted eggs have been made for the Heston range sold through Waitrose.

Inventive: Heston Blumenthal has delivered his take on the Easter Egg in a limited edition creation that comes with a surprise nest of tiny eggs on edible paper in the middle

Sales of mass market Easter Eggs have been falling in recent years as the number given to children are rationed against concerns about obesity and the price.

However, Waitrose insists there is a market for premium creations with good ingredients, rather than the cheaper options with are heavy on vegetable fat and sugar.

Heston said: ‘Shoppers will open the packaging to find a dark chocolate velveteen egg, which has been hand sprayed with chocolate to give an unusual velvet effect, lightly coating the 65per cent dark chocolate shell beneath.

‘When you crack it open you discover six mandarin ganache chocolate filled speckled hen eggs on a nest of vanilla flavour edible shredded paper.

‘The citrusy notes of the chocolate eggs against a light backdrop of vanilla in the shredded paper combine in perfect harmony.’

Festive treat: The Heston from Waitrose range was launched in 2010 and his Hidden Orange Christmas Pudding has been a sell-out success for the last four years

Chris Moore, Buyer at Waitrose said: ‘Premium Easter Eggs are rising in popularity, so it was definitely the time to introduce a Heston from Waitrose egg.

‘We've been working with Heston for over a year to create an egg that will really stand out from the crowd. There's nothing else quite like it.’

The Heston from Waitrose range was launched in 2010 and his Hidden Orange Christmas Pudding has been a sell-out success for the last four years.

His new take on the egg launches in store tomorrow.
