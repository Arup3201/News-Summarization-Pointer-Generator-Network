A 16-month old girl who was killed by her own father in a tragic car accident outside their home has now been named.

Angel Pitts died in hospital after she was hit by the reversing vehicle in Leeds, West Yorkshire, earlier this month.

Angel, who had just learned to walk, had wandered out into the garden while her mother Megin was distracted and ended up behind the car.

Tragedy: Angel Pitts, 16 months, died earlier this month after her own father accidentally ran over her

Her father, Scott Pitts, was leaving 
the home in the family car and failed to see her as he drove away, 
reversing over the little girl.

Despite
 desperate attempts by neighbours and paramedics to save her, she was 
confirmed dead a short time after arriving at Leeds General Infirmary.

Megin and Scott Pitts later released a statement regarding their daughter's funeral, inviting mourners to wear Disney clothes or animal onesies.

‘Angel Jackie-Jean Pitts died aged 16 months.

‘This
 was a tragic accident that her father did not see coming and could have
 never imagined it happening.

'We would like to thank everyone for their support at this tragic time.

‘Her funeral will take place on 
Thursday, June 26, leaving from our house at one o'clock taking our last
 walk with her to Cottingley Cemetery where the ceremony will begin at 
two o'clock.

'We are hoping for people to be wearing animal onesies or Disney dress up, if not just bright colours.

‘Anybody
 is welcome to pay their respects to her. Any donations are welcome, all
 to go to the Sweet Dreams charity that provides memory boxes at 
hospitals for parents that have lost a child’.

A neighbour described the tragic event, which took place around 7.30pm on Saturday 14th June.

'He
 [Scott Pitts] had nipped out on a quick errand on Saturday evening and 
realised mid-journey that he had forgotten something and had rushed back
 home,' the neighbour said.

'He'd
 opened the garden gate and the family dog ran out into the street.

'The mother came out trying to catch the dog, all her attention was on 
the dog.

'Nobody had seen that the little girl, who had just learned to 
walk, had come out of the gate as well and had wandered towards the rear
 of the car.

'Dad then came out of the house and reversed over the little girl.'

Another neighbour said: ‘They are devastated. Even though it is an accident, the dad is blaming himself.

'It was horrendous, the other residents tried their best to help but there was nothing to be done to save her.

'She was a lovely 16-month-old girl who had just started to walk and wanted to explore the world.'
