The billionaire owner of the Grangemouth fuel refinery was spotted relaxing on his luxury yacht just hours after winning beating union bosses at the imperiled complex into submission.

Jim Ratcliffe's company Ineos forced through a survival plan for the huge petrochemical complex in Falkirk, Scotland, which saw workers swallow a pay freeze, redundancies and changes to their pensions.

And almost as soon as the ink dried on the humiliating deal, which also bans strike action at the plant for three years, Mr Ratcliffe jetted off to his luxurious ship, moored on the Cote d'Azur in the south of France.

Luxury: Mr Ratcliffe's £130million Hampshire II was seen in the waters of the Mediterranean in the south of France

Extravagant: The handsome vessel has an upper deck bar and a below-deck wine cellar with a underwater viewing area

He entertained 23 guests on the 255ft Hampshire II superyacht, attended by his personal staff.

The extravagant vessel, valued at £130million a year, also costs the billionaire tens of millions a year in maintenance costs.

Billionaire: Mr Ratcliffe headed to the south of France after a tense week for his Grangemouth refinery

Guests on the boat could enjoy a bar on the upper deck, or visit a wine cellar below, which has a underwater viewing area.

Mr Ratcliffe's floating palace also mingles sophistication with fun, as the 82ft-tall crow's nest features a zip-wire to carry guests back to the deck. A full-sized tennis court on the deck can be converted into a helipad.

The vessel, built by Feadship completed its sea trials in 2012. It replaces the older Hampshire I.

His luxury retreat came after a tense week in Grangemouth, which saw Ineos almost close the plant after failing to reach a compromise with union leaders.

Bosses at the company had announced they would close the Grangemouth petrochemical plant after a majority of workers refused a last-ditch plan to make sure the ageing plant remained commercially viable.

Closure of the plant - said to be costing Ineos £10million a week to run - would have resulted in hundreds of job losses.

It was also feared that the oil refinery in the complex could quickly follow, costing still more jobs. The Grangemouth complex alone is responsible for ten per cent of the entire Scottish economy.

But Mr Ratcliffe seemed not to be 
phased by how close the complex - Scotland's only remaining oil refinery
- came to oblivion as the keen sailor headed to his home on the waves.

After
union leaders backed down in the dispute, and took on the survival plan
in its entirety, he hailed 'a victory for common sense'.

The
industrialist, who gained the nickname Dr No for his refusal to 
compromise with his workers, has said publicly that he is unabashed 
about his extreme wealth.

The
reclusive businessman made his money by buying up unwanted assets from 
large industrial companies - BP in the case of Grangemouth - and 
ruthlessly cutting costs to maximise profits.

Just nine years after its foundation, 
Ineos is the third-largest chemicals company in the world, and Mr 
Ratcliffe features prominently on lists of Britain's richest people.

Assets: Mr Ratcliffe owners two thirds of Ineos, which in turn owns the Grangemouth plant and refinery

He owns two-thirds of the company, giving him a fortune estimated in the billions. He is also said to have a passion for sit-on lawnmowers and own a substantial collection.

The grammar-school educated businessman used to live in Hampshire, where locals said he would often come and go by helicopter, but moved to Switzerland in 2010 for tax purposes.

He is separated from his wife Amanda, 
whom he married in 1985. She now lives in a farmhouse near Salisbury, 
Wiltshire, where she owns a horse riding company.

They have two sons, Samuel, 21 and 
George, 19. Mr Ratcliffe graduated with a degree in chemical engineering
from Birmingham University and spent 15 years as a humble chemical 
engineer.

But he then developed a taste for 
business, acquiring an MBA from the London Business School. In 1989, he 
was appointed a director of Advent International, an American private 
equity group, and became steeped in the world of finance.

In a recent interview with the Daily Telegraph, he said that he felt he had 'done his bit' for Britain after investing in its industry, even though other countries are much more attractive prospects.

He also defended the fruits of his wealth, and played down the significance of his £130million 'nice boat'.

He told the newspaper: 'Yes, I’ve made some money. But I started off in a very poor part of Manchester.

'I don’t feel hair-shirted about the fact that I have a nice boat. It’s not relevant.'
