Missing: Janet Brown has not been seen since 2005

A wealthy heiress was killed and her body hidden by her lover as part of an audacious fraud that saw him strip her and her elderly parents of all their assets, a court heard today.

Donald Graham, 59, is accused of murdering Janet Brown, who has not been seen since 2005, so he could use her estate to fund his lifestyle.

The jury at Newcastle Crown Court was told that he then set about gaining the trust of her parents, giving him access to banking information and personal documents.

Along with Elizabeth Todd, 51, he is also jointly accused of perverting the course of justice.  Todd faces charges of conspiracy to commit fraud and forgery but both defendants deny the charges.

The court heard that Miss Brown had worked as an extra on TV and as a mystery shopper but had made most of her money through developing properties.

The court heard that after first meeting Miss Brown in 1998, the pair had begun a relationship.

Robert Smith QC, prosecuting, said that in 2005 the pair had planned a holiday to France together and they had booked tickets on a ferry from Dover.

But shortly before they were due to leave, Graham told her he was unable to go because his wife was too ill for him to leave her.

Probe: Police dig up land in 2012 as part of their search for Miss Brown. The court heard she has not been in contact with any of her friends, her family, her bank and or any service such as a doctor since 2005

Miss Brown decided to go anyway, Mr Smith said, and told friends this was what she intended to do.

As a result she arranged for a friend to collect her dog from her home in Hexham, Northumberland, where she lived with her parents.

On arrival he saw that her car had gone and so assumed she had left for her trip abroad.

‘Her Porsche car was not at the farm when he arrived and he believed that Janet Brown had left for her holiday as planned,’ he said.

In court: Elizabeth Todd, 51, is accused of perverting the course of justice and conspiracy to commit fraud and forgery but denies the charges

‘He had no reason at that time to 
think otherwise. But he was never to see or hear from her again. Janet 
Brown has never been seen or spoken to since.’

Mr
 Smith told the jury since that day she has not been in contact with any
 of her friends, her family, her bank and or any service such as a 
doctor or the police.

In essence, he told the court, she had ‘disappeared from the face of the earth’.

Mr Smith said the evidence could only be explained on the basis she had been killed before she was due to leave for France and that her body had been concealed and had remained concealed ever since.

The court heard when Graham had told Miss Brown that he would not be able to go on holiday because his wife was too ill, he had in fact lied to her.

But he had since found a new girlfriend, Elizabeth Todd, with whom he had become infatuated.

Mr Smith told the jury that just before she went missing, Miss Brown transferred Graham the sum of £300,000 after he convinced her to do it through some deceit, only now known to him.

‘Donald Graham knew Janet Brown had a significant amount of money in a bank account under her name,’ said Mr Smith.

‘He wanted that money so he could live a lifestyle that involved owning and driving powerful motor cars and to buy a property for Elizabeth Todd to live in.’

Trial: The jury at Newcastle Crown Court was told Graham set about gaining the trust of Miss Brown¿s parents, giving him access to banking information and personal documents

He would go on to send postcards from 
France to Janet Brown’s parents pretending to be her, saying she had 
found a job in Europe.

Mr 
Smith told the court that Graham ingratiated himself with Miss Brown’s 
parents who were elderly and in poor health and after her mother Olive 
died he began visiting her father Eric at his home.

Work: Miss Brown worked as an extra on TV and as a mystery shopper but had made most of her money through developing properties, the court heard

He began to do his shopping for him and went on to gain his trust and confidence.

The jury heard after both parents died
 Graham went on to arrange their funerals but did not inform any 
relative but did obtain a death certificate in order to defraud Eric 
Brown’s estate.

While 
visiting he also gained access to all Janet Brown’s bank documents and 
personal affairs, obtained Eric Brown’s cheque book, details of his 
pension and went onto strip their estate of all their assets through 
false telephone calls and false withdrawal slips.

Mr Smith said Graham and Todd’s downfall came in 2009 when one of the banks that Eric Brown held an account with suspected fraudulent activity.

Staff notified police about their suspicions and an investigation began. From there, officers discovered the full extent of the fraud, which had extended to Olive and Janet Brown.

‘That investigation has since established the details of her disappearance and the reasons for her disappearance,’ said Mr Smith.

‘We will be inviting you to conclude that
 there is no other reasonable explanation for Janet Brown’s 
disappearance other than she was killed by Donald Graham so he could use
 her estate and those of her parents to fund his lifestyle.’

'Donald Graham knew Janet Brown had a significant amount of money in a bank account under her name. He wanted that money so he could live a lifestyle that involved owning and driving powerful motor cars'

Robert Smith QC, prosecuting

Mr Smith said their estates were systematically defrauded by Graham, who killed Miss Brown and planned to start a new relationship with Todd.

He told the jury that, given her history of property development, the transfer of £300,000 probably related to an intended investment in property.

‘However, Donald Graham had different plans for that money. He used the money to house his newly found girlfriend, Elizabeth Todd,’ said Mr Smith.

‘Despite her disappearance, Donald Graham placed a deposit on a house in Seaton Delaval using Janet Brown’s money. He used the money of his former girlfriend, who had disappeared just two months before, to buy a house for his new girlfriend to live in.’

The trial continues.
