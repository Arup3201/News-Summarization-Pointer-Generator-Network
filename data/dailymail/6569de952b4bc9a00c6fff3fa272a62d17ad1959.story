One speed camera near a Brooklyn high school generated over $77,500 in fines against speeding motorists on a single day in July.

The camera is mounted near Abraham Lincoln High School according to the Washington Post, and generated speeding tickets for 1,551 drivers going more than 10 miles an hour over the limit.

A speeding violation is sent to the offender 30 days after the incident is recorded and the fine totals $50.

Gotcha: City councilmen Chaim Deutsch and Mark Treyger have conflicting views of the usefulness of the current placement of the speed camera, which is near the exit ramp on the right

Sheepshead Bites, a local blog, said councilman Chaim Deutsch originally claimed that 6,000 violations were recorded on a peak day for that camera and that it would encourage safer driving. 

The Department of Transportation later released the actual numbers for the peak day, which occurred on July 7.

The camera has been a thorn in the side for another councilman, Mark Treyger, who wants them moved farther down from the parkway exit ramp.

Cameras 'should not be placed in locations like the start of an exit ramp because this ‘gotcha’ location plays into fears of many that these cameras are solely revenue generating machines,' said Treyger.

The New York State Legislature approved the use of cameras in New York City at the end of 2013, with over 20 currently deployed throughout the boroughs, all within a quarter mile of schools. 

A study released by the Department of Transportation claimed that speed cameras reduced fatalities 40 to 45 percent in areas where they were deployed. 

The New York Times reports that in 2013, there were an estimated 286 traffic fatalities in the city. 

The service road where the overachieving camera stretches along the campus of Abraham Lincoln High School, between an exit and an entrance ramp for Shore Parkway.

The school is separated by a high fence, but a sidewalk runs along the service road.
