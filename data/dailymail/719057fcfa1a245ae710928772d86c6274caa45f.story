Gareth Southgate has raised the bar for his England Under 21 squad by challenging them to secure a Euro 2015 spot with style.

England will face their biggest test of Southgate’s reign in Wolverhampton on Friday night, when they face Croatia in the first leg of their play-off meeting.

If England can negotiate Friday night's contest, plus the return leg in Vincovki next Tuesday, they will set a record of being the only nation to reach five consecutive Under 21 European Championships. But just getting there is not enough for Southgate.

He has spent the last 14 months working on a distinct pattern of play, based around passing and movement, and the coach does not want to see those principles abandoned, even on a pressurised occasion.

‘I think they will look forward to it,’ said Southgate, who on Thursday night sent Carl Jenkinson back to West Ham after the right-back failed to recover from a hamstring injury.

‘People have enjoyed watching us and there’s a big crowd wherever we’ve played. We’ve been an exciting attacking team to watch. We play a possession-based game, we averaged over 600 passes per game in the group, so we’ve got to continue to do that. That’s the style we want to keep playing in.

‘I’ve set the bar high for them. It’s not enough just to win, I want them to win with a style that will make them successful to take them to the seniors. If I’m making it harder for them, so be it. That’s the benchmark I want to set.’

Though England are without key midfielders James Ward-Prowse and Nathaniel Chalobah, through injury, Saido Berahino gives them class up front.

Southgate is thrilled with the progress of the 21-year-old, who has scored six times this season for West Brom. ‘I would hope that in an England shirt, Saido will get a suitable reception and the fans at Wolves get behind him,’ he said.

‘Then when he comes back with West Brom they hammer him like they should! I hope the local fans will be able to put their club allegiance to one side just for one night.

‘I had to have a chat with him at the end of last year, but we’ve worked quite closely together. At times when he has needed a bit of encouragement and advice we have talked regularly and I am delighted with how he has started the season.

‘We always try to work alongside the clubs in terms of player development and give the right messages to the players to keep working at their game. At the moment Saido is reaping the rewards of that.’
