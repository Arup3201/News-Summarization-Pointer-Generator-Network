Two teenage Muslim boys banned from school and put in 
'isolation' because they would not shave off their beards will be 
allowed to return to school unshaven.

Mount Carmel Roman Catholic High 
School, in Accrington, Lancashire, had said the two 14-year-olds were in 
breach of the dress code, which bans beards as well as false nails, fake
tan, make-up, dyed hair and inappropriate jewellery.

But
today the school was forced to reverse their controversial decision as 
it did not comply with the European Convention of Human Rights.

Governors
have now ruled that only Muslim boys have permission to grow a beard as
a sign of their faith - as long as they are devout and practising.

Last week the boys were sent home after a month in isolation.

Despite
their parents' claims that the punishment was a form of discrimination,
headteacher Xavier Bowers claimed it was not a religious matter.

Two Muslim students have been banned from lessons at Mount Carmel Roman Catholic High School, in Lancashire, for breaching the dress code by refusing to shave off their beards

Last
week, the school said its own research concluded they are not required 
by the Koran to wear beards, and it is therefore a personal choice to do
so.

Around a third of
the 750 pupils at Mount Carmel are from ethnic minorities, mostly 
Pakistani, according to the 2012 Ofsted report.

A
relative of one of the boys said last week: 'Because these boys cannot 
shave their beards for religious reasons, they are being put in 
isolation for six-and-a-half hours every day.

'They are not being allowed to mix with anybody or speak to friends. It is pure discrimination.

'They
chose that school because it is within their area and has good results.
The school has to have an open policy and they have to take in people 
from all religions.'

She said the youngsters were put in a room on their own and made to study without the rest of their classmates.

She
also said their parents sent the school a letter of complaint 
explaining they could not shave as their beards were symbols of their 
faith.

The letter was later 
retracted to allow for talks between the families, teachers and the 
Lancashire Council of Mosques, the relative said. 

Mr Bowers said the rule had been in 
place for a while, but had been strictly enforced from the beginning of 
the new term, after letters explaining there would be no exceptions were
sent out.

He said: 'The rule in school is that all boys have to be clean shaven.

'Having
said that, there were two Year 11 boys last year who had grown a beard 
and because it was months or weeks before their GCSE exams, I spoke to 
the two boys, who explained that on religious grounds, they wanted to 
keep their beards.

'I felt it was an unfair pressure to bear on them and I agreed to an exception.

'On
the back of that, I made arrangements to speak to a number of other 
Asian boys who were also sporting beards to make them aware there would 
not be any further exceptions and, when they came back after the summer,
they were expected to be clean-shaven. All but two did.

'Children
who turn up to school with red hair, inappropriate jewellery, false tan
or make-up are isolated in a room until the matter is addressed and 
then they return to their normal day.

'These boys were given the option to do that and chose not to.'

Tonight, in a statement the school said: 'Governors at Mount Carmel have decided that there will be no change to the school rule which requires boys to be clean shaven.

'However, following discussions with leaders of the local community, exemptions will be made in certain clearly-defined circumstances.

The school has said the pupils are breaching the dress code, which bans beards as well as false nails, fake tan, make-up, dyed hair and inappropriate jewellery (file picture)

'As a voluntary aided Catholic school, governors are the employers and legitimately set their own rules regarding uniform and appearance.

'The rule regarding boys being clean shaven is reasonable and proportional and has been in place for some time. All parents and children are fully aware and accepting of school rules.

'The rule is part of the school standards agenda along with hair style, hair colour, jewellery and make up ensuring high expectations for all pupils and that their appearance is standardised.

'The school is advised that it is part of Muslim tradition and religious belief that a beard is a sign of commitment to the Islamic faith but it is ultimately down to personal belief.

'In line with European Human Rights legislation, governors have taken the decision to only allow Muslim boys permission to grow a beard as a sign of their faith'

'Having said all that as governors of voluntary aided schools we have to comply to the European Convention of Human Rights, as do all schools.

'As part of this legislation all schools must make reasonable adjustments to school uniform on genuine religious grounds.

'The Bishop of Salford’s advice has been for governors of Mount Carmel to work with the local Islamic leaders to support boys who are genuinely and fully committed to their faith.

'With this in mind, and in line with European Human Rights legislation, governors have taken the decision to only allow Muslim boys permission to grow a beard as a sign of their faith as long as they have started the Hafiz programme at their local Mosques.

'Hafiz is an extensive programme that involves attending Mosque for 2-3 hours a day to pray and learn the Koran word by word in Arabic.'

Welcoming the decision, County Councillor Munsif Dad said: 'I’m very glad that we are moving in the right direction and I’d like to thank the headteacher and governors for their understanding and co-operation.

'Mount Carmel is an excellent school in our local community - we have always supported it and will continue to do so.

'Understandably, this has aroused some interest, but we hope we can continue the dialogue and address the issues as they arise.

'Regards this issue, we hope the school can continue the important job of providing excellent education to its students.'

The
issue of whether beards are compulsory for devout Muslims is open to 
interpretation, according to Professor Muhammad Abdel Haleem, of the 
School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London.

Growing debate: Last month David Cameron weighed in on the debate about religious dress code in schools

He
said the Prophet Muhammad was believed to have had a beard and that men
insisting on doing the same claimed they were emulating his actions.

Mr Bowers said the issue was not one of religion, but of upholding school rules.

He
said: 'We have not taken this decision lightly. I have spent quite a 
lot of time researching the issue and speaking to Muslim elders.

'There
is nothing specifically written in the Koran about wearing a beard. It 
is a choice those boys are making. However inclusive we are, we have 
standards to maintain.'

Chairman of governors Dennis Ford said: 'The decision to uphold the rule was made by governors and it is a rule for everybody.'

Abdul
Hamid Quereshi, chairman of the Lancashire Council of Mosques, said: 
'The headteacher is co-operating and the school wants to learn about the
issue and address them appropriately.

'Different people have different variations of understanding.

'Some are newly interacting with the Muslim community and it is our duty not to put people in awkward positions.'

Last
month the Prime Minister indicated he would support guidelines to 
judges, teachers and immigration officers telling them when Muslim women
can be asked to remove their veils.
