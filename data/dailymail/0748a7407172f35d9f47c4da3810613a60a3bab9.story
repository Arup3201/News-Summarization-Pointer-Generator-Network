Cash-strapped shoppers are turning away from supermarket bulk-buy offers in a bid to cut costs and food waste, according to a Bank of England report.

It said retailers were increasingly finding multi-buy deals such as ‘buy-one-get-one-free’ less effective.

The findings come after such offers were criticised for offering ‘bogus’ bargains, luring customers into buying more than they need and not always saving them money.

Shelving multi-buys: Shoppers have become increasingly suspicious of supermarket deals

The Bank’s report, published today, said families remain ‘focused on value for money’, with discount shops and cheap online options enjoying a booming trade.

It said: ‘Some retailers suggest that multi-buy promotions were becoming less effective.

‘[This is] perhaps because consumers had become more focused on containing spending, or reducing waste.’

It comes after such deals were attacked by the Office of Fair Trading for repeatedly misleading shoppers.

One of the scams involves supermarkets regularly abusing the fact that people believe buying in bulk saves money, which is not always correct.

For example, a ‘bigger value’ three-tin pack of Princes tuna for £5.68 was found to be nearly £1 more expensive than buying three individual tins.

Shoppers are penalised for not bothering to do the arithmetic to work out what is cheapest.

Tempting? Shoppers are bombarded with deals in supermarkets

And in April, the Local Government Association said multi-buy deals are partly responsible for a £13.7billion-a-year mountain of wasted fresh produce.

The Association complained that deals on products with a short shelf life mean a lot of food is thrown away.

The Bank’s report, called Agents’ Summary of Business Conditions, highlighted a number of other ways that families are trying to cut back.These included ‘shorter’ holidays ‘spent closer to home’.

It said higher prices for essentials had ‘squeezed the amount of income left for more discretionary services, causing a decline in spending on a range of leisure activities’.
