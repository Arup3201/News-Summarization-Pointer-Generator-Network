A reporter on a Fox-owned Spanish-language TV station in L.A. has been charged with two felony counts of injuring a spouse and now faces ten years in prison.

Carlos Zapata, 51, who reports for MundoFox Channel 22, is alleged to have thrown a flower pot at his wife’s head on December 3, causing serious injury.

The pot struck Luisiana Gonzalez 'full force,' said an LAPD spokesman.

Zapata was arrested at 1:40 a.m. on Tuesday at the Encore Apartments complex in the Sherman Oaks neighborhood of L.A., according to police records.

After the arrest, Gonzalez told police that her husband had previously attacked her during an argument a month ago - which has led the district attorney to make two felony charges, reports the Los Angeles Times.

Zapata was released on $50,000 bail and is scheduled for an arraignment at the Los Angeles County Superior Court on Dec. 24. He faces a maximum of 10 years in state prison.

According to his biography on the Channel 22 website - which has since been taken down - Zapata is an award-winning journalist with experience of reporting in the U.S., Mexico and Puerto Rico.

MundoFox is an American Spanish language broadcast television network that is operated as a joint venture between the Fox International Channels and Colombian private broadcaster RCN Televisión SA. The network launched in August 2012 and is headquartered in L.A.
