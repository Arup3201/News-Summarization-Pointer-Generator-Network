Doctors have become so casual about their work attire that patients struggle to identify their position at a hospital

Unless they return to a more traditional uniform, they risk ‘eroding’ the patients’ trust in their competence, a senior consultant has warned.

Medical staff in white coats and ties have become a rare sight since they were banned by the NHS in 2007, restricting the wearing of the classic attire to private practices.

Dress to impress: Unless they dress in proper uniforms, doctors risk losing the respect of patients as they struggle to identify their position at a hospital

Following a decision by the Department
 of Health, doctors were ordered to remove ties, watches, coats and 
shirts and remain ‘bare below the elbow’ in order to make it easier to 
wash their hands and prevent spreading bacteria.

‘I hear that patients complain that 
they do not know who the doctor is: no tie, no white coat, no jacket and
 no presence,’ Stephanie Dancer, consultant microbiologist at Hairmyres 
hospital, Lanarkshire writes in the British Medical Journal.

‘Untidiness erodes the image of 
doctors as responsible and competent.’ ‘[Smartness] gives confidence to 
patients who might be facing life or death decisions.’

Dr Dancer writes that the 2007 ban has
 been seen as a ‘green light’ for doctors to dress casual and adds that 
there is no evidence that wearing a white coat helps spread infection.

However the Department of Health stands firm in their ban of white coats.

‘NHS staff should wear short-sleeved 
tops and not wear white coats during patient activity – being “bare 
below the elbow” makes it easier for staff to wash their hands and lower
 arms regularly,’ a spokesperson told The Times.

‘However, NHS staff should also dress in a way which inspires public and patient confidence.

Dr Dancer argues the opposite, saying 
that casual attire may have the opposite effect as ‘street clothes’ may 
not be washed regularly enough, compared to a white hospital coat.

‘It could be argued that ditching the 
white coat and tie for hygiene purposes has had the converse effect, in
 that the informal attire now gracing our wards has encouraged a less 
robust view of infection control.’
