As Sue Gordon lay frail and exhausted on a hospital bed following intensive treatment for stage three lung cancer, her daughter held her close, in a poignant reversal of the roles of mother and child.  

Losing a parent is always heart-breaking – yet, ever since that dreadful moment, actress Tricia Penrose has known that hers will be stolen from her far too soon.

‘We’ve always been more like sisters,’ says the 43-year-old from Liverpool, better known to millions across Britain as barmaid Gina in the series Heartbeat.

‘Mum is the first person I call whenever anything happens – when I met my husband Mark, got engaged and discovered I was pregnant. She even held my hand at the birth of both my children.’

With Sue’s support she rose from humble beginnings to stardom, and today she lives just a short drive from Sue in a beautiful barn conversion with businessman and property developer Mark Simpkin, 41, and sons, Jake, ten, and Freddy, five.

But, for the moment at least, Tricia has turned her back on television to care for her mother, who at 60 has been told that the tumour in her lung will one day kill her.

‘I’m turning down acting and singing jobs to spend as much time as I can with Mum. There have been so many offers from telly, theatre tours and musicals, but I can’t even think about being away at the moment.’

Tricia’s modest upbringing might explain the pair’s incredibly close bond. Tricia says: ‘Mum was still living with her parents in a tiny house when I arrived. There was her, my aunt and myself all in one bed.’

Her mother adds: ‘She was a little 
show-off. She was always doing shows in the garage, so we sent her to 
the Elliott-Clarke Drama School.’

When
 Tricia was 15 the pair of them formed a duo called Second Image and 
sang in local nightclubs. ‘It was so much fun,’ says Sue. ‘Everyone said
 how alike we looked.’

Later, Tricia got her a job as an occasional extra in Heartbeat.

Sue adds: ‘I’d have my hair and make-up done and sit in the background in the pub. Tricia met Gary Barlow, you know.’

Tricia clarifies: ‘He did an episode of Heartbeat. It was great fun, and he did concerts for us back at the hotel in the evenings.’

The Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation (freephone 0333 323 7200) has the following tips for carers of ill relatives:

Photographs dotted around Sue’s sitting room are testimony to their physical similarities through the years, and they both have the same startling bright blue-green eyes.

To her regret, Sue had smoked from her teens – and, although she gave up more than a decade ago, she is now among the 85 per cent of lung cancer patients who are former smokers.  

She recalls: ‘We never thought about how it affected health in those days. There were no warnings on the packets. ‘I quit in my late 40s. I didn’t want my grandchildren to grow up with a granny who smoked.’

Unfortunately, giving up doesn’t mean you are exempt from lung cancer – and it is something of a myth that ex-smokers’ lungs completely return to normal.

However, it is still true that the sooner someone kicks the habit,  the better.

‘If you give up smoking at 30, you have a 1.5 per cent chance of death from lung cancer, give up at 40 and it’s three per cent, at 50 it’s six per cent,’ says Professor David Baldwin, consultant respiratory physician at Nottingham University Hospitals.

‘Those who have never smoked only have a 0.5 per cent chance of death from lung cancer.’

More than 40,000 people are diagnosed with lung cancer each year and there are 35,000 deaths annually. It is the second most common cancer.

A key reason behind the high mortality rate is late diagnosis. Symptoms are vague, including a constant cough, unexplained weight loss, chest infections and chest or shoulder pain. Once diagnosed, prognosis is generally poor.

‘The statistics are appalling,’ says Dr Jesme Fox, medical director of The Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation. ‘After diagnosis, around 30 per cent of people will live for at least a year.’

Long-term survival rates are low – only eight per cent will live for more than five years post-diagnosis.

So it is nothing short of a miracle that Sue is sitting cheerfully in her sitting room in Oldham, Manchester.

She is immaculate and slender and doesn’t look remotely ill. Her hair is swept into an elegant chignon and her skin is tanned.

It was – unsurprisingly – Tricia who first noticed that there was something wrong. ‘I was doing her make-up for an event in Liverpool in spring 2010 and noticed that Mum’s eyes looked sunken. I suddenly realised that she had lost lots of weight.’

Sue dismissed their concerns. ‘Who complains about being slim?’

But a few weeks later she doubled over with a searing pain in her right side whilst the family were having Sunday lunch.

‘It was like being electrocuted. Tricia massaged it, but couldn’t alleviate the agony. The next morning my husband Danny took me to hospital.’

She was initially diagnosed with pneumonia but surgeons noticed a shadow on Sue’s lung. A bronchoscopy – where a tube was put down the back of her throat – revealed a 3½in tumour in her right lung.

‘The day of the results Mum was supposed to call me at 2pm, just after her appointment,’ says Tricia.

‘When she finally rang, her voice was just a whisper. She had an inoperable tumour on her right lung. I just sank to the floor crying.’

Every day for six and a half weeks, Tricia took Sue to The Christie cancer hospital in Manchester. ‘Standard treatment is 33 sessions of radiotherapy and two rounds – which is 12 days – of chemotherapy,’ says Dr Corinne Faivre-Finn, the consultant oncologist at The Christie. The radiotherapy Sue underwent was cutting edge.

Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy, which is now standard at The Christie, allows the strength of the radiation to be adjusted.

A higher dose can be delivered to the tumour but not to the surrounding and healthy tissue. Sue lived with Tricia and Mark throughout this gruelling time. ‘I washed her hair like she was my little girl,’ says Tricia. ‘Mark adores her and is very close to her as well.’

Dr Faivre-Finn adds: ‘We were conducting a clinical trial to see whether additional chemotherapy may help the final outcome. Sue was only able to undergo one further round.’

Tricia explains: ‘The treatment took its toll on Mum, and we had been told to prepare for the worst right from the start.

During the long hours while the drugs dripped into her we planned her funeral. I blubbed the whole time.’

Sue wipes her eye: ‘But at least you know what I want – right down to the coffin.’ In fact, Sue frequently kept her family buoyant. ‘I got very depressed during her treatment  and had to go on antidepressants,’ admits Tricia.  

Sue seems to invariably see the humour in her bleak situation. She mock-sternly adds: ‘I had to tell her to snap out of it and get a grip. You know why I’m so brown?’ she whispers. ‘It’s because of the chemotherapy – it makes your tan last.’

The family didn’t have any counselling. ‘We counselled each other,’ says Tricia. Following treatment, the tumour had shrunk to an inch.

‘Even the oncologist cheered,’ remembers Sue. Although she tries to lead as normal a life as possible, she is often exhausted.

‘Some days I sleep the whole time. Sometimes I have a cry to myself. But I firmly believe a positive attitude makes a difference.’

She is also on a near-liquid diet. ‘The radiotherapy damaged my oesophagus and I choke on solid food. It’s terrifying, so I’m on rice pudding and mashed potato.’

However, she takes no drugs. ‘I weaned myself off my morphine, though the doctor was a bit cross because I just stopped taking it  and then wondered why I had hallucinations.’

Tricia says: ‘The worry is that the tumour will relapse or that it will spread around her body.’

Should this happen, she can’t undergo any further radiotherapy, as her body won’t withstand further damage. Every three months Sue has a lung scan and blood tests.

‘Any symptoms – weight loss or pain – she has to call the doctor straight away,’ adds Tricia.

However heart-breaking their situation may seem, Dr Faivre-Finn believes theirs is a story of hope: ‘She is enjoying a good quality  of life.’

That all important two year anniversary was celebrated with high tea at the Manchester Hilton.

Next up is the five year landmark on July 1, 2015. ‘I think we’ll have champagne at that one,’ says Sue, and she and Tricia embrace and kiss.
