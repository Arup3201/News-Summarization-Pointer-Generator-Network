Invisible man: Michael Aspel, 79, claimed the BBC wanted a glamorous figure to present Antiques Roadshow

Veteran presenter Michael Aspel claims he would still be presenting Antiques Roadshow if he was ‘as beautiful’ as his replacement, Fiona Bruce.

Aspel, 79, who presented the hit BBC1 programme for eight years until being replaced by Bruce in 2008, said he had lost the slot because the corporation wanted a glamorous figure instead of an ‘elderly English bloke plodding around’.

Speaking out after Bruce said she dyed her grey hairs because she was worried about the impact ageing would have on her career, Aspel said he felt like the ‘invisible man’ of British television because of a lack of offers of work.

He said: ‘Fiona does a great job and looks very beautiful. That’s what they wanted, so it was entirely successful. I just wish I’d been a little more beautiful then I could still be doing it.’

He added: ‘They simply felt that they wanted to get away from the middle-aged to elderly English bloke plodding around and get some glamour in.’

The father of seven, who was once one of the biggest names on British television thanks to hit shows such as Ask Aspel, Come Dancing and Crackerjack, said he struggled to find work. Aspel said: ‘That’s the worst thing about stopping work; you begin to feel invisible whereas you were highly visible before.’

He said he had turned down a request to appear in an early series of Strictly Come Dancing, adding: ‘The prospect of being chucked out on the first show was an ignominy I couldn’t bear.’
