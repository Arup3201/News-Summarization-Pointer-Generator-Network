The investment banker whose divorce proceedings are sending shock waves through New York City following claims of rampant drug use and partner swapping by his soon to be ex-wife is taking some time off, as his wife is showing off some support from a somewhat surprising source - their daughters

It was announced on Thursday that Sage Kelly, 42, the $7 million-a-year head of healthcare investment banking at Jefferies, had taken a temporary leave of absence from the firm.

That same afternoon, his wife Christina was photographed arriving at her lawyer's office with a binder covered with Post-it notes from the couple's daughters, Cameron and Logan.

 The notes said; 'I don't like you, I love you'; 'Your [sic] the best mom'; and 'I love you.'

She was also accompanied by a man wearing an earpiece who followed closely behind her and appeared to possibly be a bodyguard.

Bad week: News of Sage's break comes just one day after documents in the acrimonious divorce between Sage and his Christina (above) became public

Bombshell claims: Christina stated in court documents that her husband used drugs including cocaine, ecstasy, Molly, Ketamine, mushrooms and even heroin

Jefferies Chief Executive Officer Richard Handler released a statement on Thursday addressing Sage's leave, saying, 'In an effort to deal with these matters, Sage Kelly has requested a voluntary leave of absence. 

 In her affidavit Christina makes numerous drug claims about her husband Sage, including:

-In 2002 he snorted heroin at a club in Southampton and then tried to walk home barefoot several miles

-In 2007, while doing Ketamine, he became so depressed that he demanded to hold their daughter for several hours until he came out of his K-hole

-In 2011 he had a magic mushroom party, at which he consumed so many of the fungi the group hid the bag from him. He then found the bag and began popping them in his mouth, after smearing blood on his face

-In 2012, after a night of cocaine and booze in Boston, he pressured Christina into having sex with Marc Beer and Beer's girlfriend in order to secure his business. Sage also had sex with Beer's girlfriend that evening in a bed next to Beer and Christina

-In May 2014 he attended a drugfest Bachelor Party in Las Vegas filled with illegal activity including drugs and hookers 

-Sage was only able to have sex with Christina and only showed interest in sex after doing cocaine

-Sage has admitted to occasional drug use, but denies most of Christina's claims  

'Sage is embroiled in a deeply personal and painful situation, and, as such, we have decided to accept his decision to take time off to focus on doing what is in the best interest of his children. 

'We cannot express how deeply we regret the agony and distraction that this has caused all of us, not to mention our clients, each of whom has categorically denied the allegations.

'We are not happy to be in this unfair position.'

FOX Business is reporting that Jefferies has lost five clients already as a result of this scandal. 

Details of Christina Di Mauro Kelly's shocking affidavit filed in her divorce and custody case against her husband were made public on Wednesday.

The papers filed by Christina portrayed her husband as a drug addict with a penchant for everything from cocaine, Molly, ecstasy, and Ketamine to magic mushrooms and even heroin.

She also claimed that at one point in their relationship her husband pressured her to have sex with Aegerion Pharmaceuticals boss Marc Beer, something that led to a foursome with the three and Beer's girlfriend in a room at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston, this after a night of cocaine and booze.

Elsewhere in her affidavit, Christina describes a drug-fueled sex party with hookers that took place in Las Vegas this May, an incident in which she claims Sage was having a negative reaction to Ketamine and, while in a K-hole, held their terrified 3-year-old daughter for several hours, and another during a mushroom party when he smeared his own blood on his face after a morning spent popping the psychedelic fungi. 

Sage has denied his wife claims, saying, 'While [she] and I used recreational drugs on occasion at certain social events in the past, the Wolf of Wall Street tale she tells this court is a work of fiction.'

Getting on with things: Christina was spotted later in the day on Thursday in a new outfit outside her apartment

His wife also admits to her own substance abuse problems, having been caught on video snorting cocaine at their apartment this July and getting charged with felony DWI and endangering the welfare of a child after crashing her Range Rover into a telephone pole in 2010 while both her children were in the car. 

She ultimately received three years of probation. 

They are fighting over money and custody of their children.

Christina claims that both frequently did drugs while their children were in their care.

Struggles: Christina (above in a 2010 mugshot) has admitted to her own problem with substance abuse, and was even charged with DWI in 2010 after getting into an accident with her children in the car

It is unknown at this time if two other men at Jefferies also named in Christina's documents will also be taking some time off.

Christina made claims that her husband's boss at the company, Ben Lorello, also did cocaine, and that Sage had sex with the wife of close friend and co-worker Dung Nguyen during a night of drug use and partying at their Sag Harbor home.

As of now, Lorello has taken over Sage's responsibilities at Jefferies.
