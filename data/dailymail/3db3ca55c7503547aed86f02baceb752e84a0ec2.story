Troubled star Lindsay Lohan 'shamelessly snorted cocaine off her wrist in a nightclub bathroom' with her 'breast hanging out of her dress', according to a new memoir by gossip blogger Nik Richie.

The founder of TheDirty.com revealed in his explosive autobiography, Lohan, 26, took the drug during a paid appearance at a Miami New Years Eve party in 2008, while her girlfriend at the time, DJ Sam Ronson, was performing.

In Sex, Lies & The Dirty Richie describes Lohan's drug use as brazen and said the incident 'freaked him out.'

Shameless: Blogger Nik Ritchie has described the moment he saw Lohan snort cocaine off her wrist in a Miami nightclub (pictured, the star on the night in question)

Speaking to Radar about his explosive memoir, Richie describes the disturbing event: 'It’s candlelit, but the light makes my pupils shrink. Lindsay goes straight for the toilet, pulling her dress up and sitting and one of her breasts is hanging out the top of the dress.

'I start to wash my hands and she asks me, ‘So, what’s your story?’ before doing an uneven line of coke off her wrist.

'The chick from Mean Girls doing blow on the toilet next to me. She’s not the same girl anymore.'

Wild-eyed: Lohan reportedly didn't care who saw her take cocaine - Ritchie alleges she got paid $25,000 for the appearance at the club (pictured)

Richie, who is known for his outspoken and often vitriolic blogspots, explained he was at the club to appear alongside Ronson and Lohan when he saw the Liz and Dick star slip into the bathroom.

He had already told the PR girl to give him the nod when Lohan went alone to the toilet area.

He claims Lohan was paid $25,000 as the headliner and admits in the book he used the appearance to orchestrate a break up between the pair, who were the 'hot couple' of the moment.

Richie, who is married to former The Bachelor winner Shayne Lomas, added  he revealed to Ronson what her girlfriend was doing.

He writes her response was: 'Ugh!' and describes Sam as a 'bit of a dude.'

But when he tries to chat up Ronson, he describes flame-haired Lindsay working herself into a frenzy before screaming at security to chuck him out.

After the pair pose for photos, where Ritchie alleges they 'feed the media a story' he writes that he returns to his hotel and hears screaming and glass smashing.

It later emerges Lohan and Ronson were in the room above him and it is widely reported The Canyons star caused $13,000 of damage.

Ronson and Lohan split three months later in early 2009.

MailOnline has contacted Lohan for a comment.
