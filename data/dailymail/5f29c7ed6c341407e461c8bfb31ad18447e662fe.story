An 8-year-old girl says she felt like a common criminal yesterday when she was handcuffed and carted off to jail after throwing a tantrum at school.

Jmyha Rickman, a student at Lovejoy Elementary School in Alton, Illinois, threw a fit in a classroom yesterday morning.

The girl is understood to have had tantrums at school before, but when Jmyha became too much for school staffers to handle, the police were called.

Excessive? Jmyha Rickman, a student at Lovejoy Elementary School in Alton, Illinois, was hauled off to jail after she threw a fit in a classroom yesterday morning

An officer responded to the school, where he handcuffed Jmyha and stuffed her into the back of his squad car.

She was then taken to the Alton Police Department, where she was allegedly held in a jail cell for two hours.

Jmyha's guardian, Nehemiah Keeton, told KMOV-TV: 'Her eyes were swollen from her crying and her wrists had welts on them and they cuffed her feet too. 

He added that the tantrum started because 'she asked to use the restroom several times and was ignored.'

Kristie Baumgartner, assistant 
superintendent of the Alton School District, told MailOnline that she 
could not comment on specifics of the incident, citing Illinois privacy 
laws regarding children.

However, she outlined school district policy, which says that if a student is at risk of harming themselves or others, police would be called if the child's parent or guardian refuses to pick them up.

Alton police told the station that Jmyha was placed in a juvenile detention room and was supervised the whole time.

The department also claimed that the girl was out of control and tearing up two classrooms - and the officer believes he did the right thing.

But Mr Keeton contends that the girl’s tantrum was met with excessive force.

He told KMOV: 'This is something that I don’t feel like any 7 or 8 year old - I mean,  she didn't have a weapon threatening to harm anybody.'
