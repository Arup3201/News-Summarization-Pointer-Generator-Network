Passengers headed home after Thanksgiving were met with a line for airport security reportedly more than a mile long.

People hoping to fly out of Chicago Midway Sunday morning were left facing a chain which stretched the entire way through the airport terminal then doubled back on itself, on a day where 1,800 flights were delayed nationwide.

Those stuck vented their anger at the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and many missed their flights, while slogging through the line which reportedly peaked at 1.2miles.

Mile-long line: Passengers were stuck in enormous lines snaking through Chicago Midway airport Sunday

Long road to victory: One flier documented her journey during the line's peak, from 6.50am until getting through the gate at 7.30am

Keep on keepin' on: After 20 minutes, this passenger had reached the start of the regular line, and after 31 the gate itself was in sight

Finally: Just over 40 minutes after the first picture, @NessieCakes makes it through to her flight

Frustrated passengers found themselves queuing outside the airport itself, as the thick crowd of people snaked to the train station in front of the terminal.

According to the Chicago Aviation Department, the line started early and had subsided by 9.15am.

A spokesman said: 'This happens sometimes. There was a period of time earlier this morning, between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m., that lines were long because that is when most people are traveling for the holiday period.'

'This place is absolutely insane. Never seen an airport this busy', tweeted flier Amanda Dahl from the terminal.

Another, posting a picture seemingly from inside the train station, said: 'Ever seen this part of Chicago Midway airport? Me neither.' Two long lines could be seen either at either side of a raised tunnel.

Midway was not the only airport to be hit by thronging travel demands at the end of the holiday weekend. Nationwide around 3,000 flights were delayed and 190 canceled, according to CNN.

Lengthy: The monster line, which left the terminal and snaked back, hit the airport from 6am to 8am

Heaving: Passengers say the intimidatingly long line managed to move quickly, though some did miss flights

Lines: Unimpressed travelers posted pictures of the enormous line this morning, which led some to miss their flight

Out and back again: The chain reportedly reached the train station outside of the terminal, where passengers doubled back to get a space

Fog and wind caused delays at Denver International Airport on Sunday, and 46 incoming flights were diverted to other cities on one of the busiest travel days of the year after bad weather knocked out three of its six runways.

Most of the diverted flights landed in Colorado Springs, about 90 miles south. By the afternoon two-hour delays and shrunk to one hour, through departures were also slowing down. 

A spokesman for Denver Airport said: 'It's not turning out to be the best travel day.' 

Hold-up: The snaking line had reportedly dispersed by late morning

Clogged up: Travelers reported that the chain went the entire way through the terminal. Pictured is an aerial view of Midway

A cold front that moved through Denver and other cities on Colorado's Front Range helped create the fog, according to the National Weather Service.

The temperature dropped 16 degrees in less than 30 minutes at the Denver airport because of the front, while 60 miles north in the city of Greeley, the temperature fell 21 degrees in 20 minutes.

The Denver airport expected 166,000 passengers on Sunday and 157,000 on Monday as the Thanksgiving weekend wrapped up.

Normally, about 144,000 passengers a day use the airport.

Denver was the fifth-busiest airport in the U.S. last year with 53 million passengers.
