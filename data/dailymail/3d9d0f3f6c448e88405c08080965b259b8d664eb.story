The sun has finally made an appearance in Britain in time for the start of summer today - and forecasters say it is here to stay.

After a stretch of damp weather sun-starved Britons flocked to the coast on one of the hottest days of the year yesterday, with temperatures climbing to 23.7C in London.

Today - which marks the meteorological start of summer following one of the coldest springs on record - dawned bright and sunny for much of the country, and the Met Office said the mercury could hit 25C by the middle of next week.

At long last: Sunbathers flocked to Brighton Beach today as the country finally readies itself for a prolonged warm spell

Crowds: The shores around Brighton Pier were packed with people soaking up the sunshine today, with the south coast enjoying the best of the weather

Ideal conditions: Rowers took advantage of the fine weather as they trained on the rowing course at Peterborough Regatta today

While today's temperatures won't 
quite reach the heights seen yesterday, people on the south coast can 
look forward to a high of 20C.

The
outlook is less promising for Scotland and parts of Northern Ireland, 
where showers are predicted, but Met Office forecaster David Jackson 
said it would be a pleasant day for most of England.

'For quite a lot of the country there's going to be some good sunny spells,' he said.

Summer at last: Lily Fletcher, seven, looks delighted by the sunshine in the New Forest, Hampshire, today

Blue skies: It was shorts and t-shirt time for visitors to Furzey Gardens in the New Forest, Hampshire, today

Colourful: Three friends enjoy the warm weather against a backdrop of vibrant pink blooms in the picturesque Hampshire park today

'Most places will be dry and bright with temperatures around 18C or 19C, rising to 20C on the south coast.'

Mr
Jackson said tomorrow could bring showers in Scotland and possibly 
Northern England, but that the outlook was generally mild and pleasant for the duration of the 
weekend.

Summer fun: The first day of June dawned bright and sunny across much of England, including this picturesque corner of Hampshire

Vivid pink: The Met Office said temperatures could climb to 25C by the middle of next week, as Britons enjoyed blue skies and sunshine today

Summer traditions: Racegoers were seen preparing their picnics today ahead of the Investec Derby at Epsom Downs Racecourse in Surrey

'Through Sunday afternoon temperatures will be fairly similar; in the high teens and up to 20C in the South East.

'It's not as good as yesterday, which just missed out on being the hottest day of the year,' Mr Jackson said.

Londoners enjoyed a balmy 23.7C yesterday afternoon - a fraction beneath the 23.8C recorded on May 7, which remains the hottest day of 2013 so far.

Mr Jackson said temperatures were 
still below average for the time of year, but added: 'What we'll find 
next week is that it will start to warm up a bit.

'Northern
England could see a bit of rain, there might be a few sharp showers, 
but it's mostly going to be dry with good sunny spells,' he said.

'By Wednesday or Thursday the temperature could get up to the mid twenties.'
