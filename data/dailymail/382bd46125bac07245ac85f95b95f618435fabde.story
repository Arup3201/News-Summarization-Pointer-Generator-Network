A pub-goer was rushed to hospital after being attacked by a 10ft python on her way home from a night out with friends.

Sue Cull was bitten while police were hunting for the snake after it went missing near her house in South Wales.

'It is incredible - who would think you would get attacked by a python in Swansea,' she said.

The 47-year-old took a short cut across the grass near to where she lived when she suddenly felt pain in her shins, and thought she'd walked through stinging nettles.

Bite: Sue shows the puncture wounds she received on her shin, which measure 3ins across

But when she arrived home, she noticed blood streaming from both legs - and after desperately trying to stop the flow from 3ins-wide puncture wounds, called an ambulance.

'At first I thought the pain was just stinging nettles. But looked down to see blood streaming onto my shoes.

'I had no idea it was a snake because it was dark. I would have been scared out of my life if I had seen it.

'When I came back home my partner asked: "Have you fallen over and why are you bleeding?".

'I grabbed the first aid kit but the bandage didn't stop the blood at all - the left leg was worst than the right.'

Sue called an ambulance and paramedics told her she had been bitten by a snake, which had escaped from a nearby house in the Dyfatty suburb of Swansea.

She said: 'They said it was a snake bite. I couldn't believe my ears.'

She treated at nearby Morriston Hospital, Swansea, where doctors examined her bites.

They phoned the Medical Reptile Unit in London which told them to measure the bite -and they then confirmed it was a python.

The victim said: 'I couldn't get warm and I was shaking. My face started to swell up.

'I was put on a drip and I stayed overnight in hospital - thankfully, I've made a full recovery.'

Police confirmed they received a report of pet python going missing from a home in Swansea.

But a spokesman said the reptile was discovered in a pipe at the owner's property - and was safely back in its box.

Pythons' bites are not poisonous but kill their prey by constricting them.

A spokesman for the Reptile Centre in Cardiff said: 'It is possible that she had an allergic reaction to the bite. Any snake may well bite if it is frightened - but the bite alone with not kill you.'

A South Wales Police spokesman said: 'We did have a call that the snake was lost but we were called again to say it was in the house and it was back in its box.

'The ambulance service took a woman to Morriston Hospital with two bites on her legs - the hospital is saying they looked like snake bites.'
