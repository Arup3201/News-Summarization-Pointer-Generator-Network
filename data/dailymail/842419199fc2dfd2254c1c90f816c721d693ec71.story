Bestseller: Unlikely author, Barbara 'Cutie' Cooper, pictured, is shooting her way up the Amazon bestseller list with a self-help guide to a happy marriage

An unlikely author is shooting her way up the Amazon bestseller list with a self-help guide to a long and happy marriage - and she is very qualified to dish out the advice.

Barbara 'Cutie' Cooper, 96, was married to husband Harry, who passed away in 2010, for a whopping 73 years and, with the help of her granddaughters, has jotted down her pearls of wisdom on how to go the distance with your partner - including sassy sex tips.

'If you wish to stay connected and happy in your marriage, never be too tired or too busy to feel love for your partner,' she writes.

'When your life is nearly over, you will regret it if you look back and recall too many nights when you made excuses instead of making love.'

'Fall in Love for Life: Inspiration from a 73-Year Marriage,' published by Chronicle Books, hit the shelves on January 1 and has since made its way to the Amazon Top 100 bestseller list.

Before he died at age 98, Cutie and Harry 'PopPop' Cooper were known for their blog 'The OGs', where the LA couple shared stories, photos and videos about their neighborhood and trips abroad as well as advice on how they kept their marriage alive so long.

Many of those tips found their way into 'Fall in Love for Life.'

In the book, Cutie writes: 'I don't understand couples who say they are too busy or too tired to sleep together. Unless they are building roads all day or running a multi-national corporation, I expect they have just lost sight of priorities.'

Love: Barbara 'Cutie' Cooper, 96, pictured right, was married to husband Harry, left, who passed away in 2010, for 73 years and now she's written a bestselling book about how they did it

She says for a healthy relationship, you have to train yourself to focus most of your attention on the person you love.

'When your sweetheart comes into the room, whether it's just from taking care of some chores in the garage or from a long day at work, your job is to put down whatever you're doing, look him in the eye, and verbally express your delight at seeing him again. It's really so little to ask, and delivers so much - to both of you.'

She writes in the guide, that some people have affairs because they don't think they're getting enough attention at home or that their partner isn't meeting all their needs.

Advice still rings true: Cutie says in the book, pictured, for a healthy relationship, you have to train yourself to focus most of your attention on the person you love

'Well, whoever told them that one person
 could meet their every need?' she exclaims. 'You can actually live 
quite comfortably without having all of your needs met. Try thinking 
about it that way; you might be surprised how liberating it is.

'You are 
not perfect, and neither is your partner, but you can make a very 
pleasant life together if you are both serious about providing the love 
and support that go along with a marriage.'

She accepts that life gets pretty hectic when children enter the equation, but Cutie's advice is to squeeze some romance into the chaos at any opportunity, no matter how small a dose.

Romance: She accepts that life gets pretty hectic when children enter the equation, but Cutie's advice is to squeeze some romance into the chaos at any opportunity

'It's true that when your babies are small, there isn't much time left over for romantic gestures. But the wonderful thing about romance is that it is the quality, never the quantity, that matters.'

She suggests throwing a blanket on the living room floor when the baby is sleeping and slicing some peaches or plums, pouring a glass of something bubbly, and enjoying a 'mini picnic.'

'Write love notes to each other and slip them in between the clean diapers,' she writes. 'Be creative, and if you want your love to flourish, it certainly will do so.'

1. Make time to make love 'I don't understand couples who say they are too busy or too tired to sleep together. Unless they are building roads all day or running a multi-national corporation, I expect they have just lost sight of priorities. If you wish to stay connected and happy in your marriage, my advice to you is to never be too tired or too busy to feel love for your partner. When your life is nearly over, you will regret it if you look back and recall too many nights when you made excuses instead of making love.'

2. Always greet your partner 'If you want your relationship to survive and to thrive, you will have to train yourself to focus most of your attention on the person you love. When your sweetheart comes into the room, whether it's just from taking care of some chores in the garage or from a long day at work, your job is to put down whatever you're doing, look him in the eye, and verbally express your delight at seeing him again. It's really so little to ask, and delivers so much - to both of you.'

3. Keep the romance alive, even when you have children 'It's true that when your babies are small, there isn't much time left over for romantic gestures. But the wonderful thing about romance is that it is the quality, never the quantity, that matters. So when the baby is napping, throw a blanket on the living room floor, slice some peaches or plums or whatever you have in the house, pour a glass of something bubbly, and enjoy a mini picnic. Write love notes to each other and slip them in between the clean diapers. Be creative, and if you want your love to flourish, it certainly will do so.'

4. Be honest about money problems 'The most important ingredient for getting through tough economic times is THE TRUTH - it's so important it should be capitalized and italicized. So this means that if you have any financial secrets you are keeping from your partner, you must put them on the table. Doesn't that sound scary? I am sure it does, but as with so many unpleasant things that only get bigger and stronger in the dark, these secrets have a funny way of shrinking in the light of the truth. And as they get smaller, your stress and worry will fly away. There's never a better time to be honest with your partner and yourself and make a plan for dealing with your debts and your excess spending - together. I promise, you will not regret it.'

5. Control your anger 'Have you ever noticed that you can't spell dangerous without anger? I'm no linguist, but I don't think that's a coincidence. When you're ready to blow, you might say anything hurtful, things you would normally spare the person you love from hearing. Don't say something you'll regret forever. Don't give your partner an excuse to come back to you with his or her own resentments. Instead, find a way to get your anger under control. For myself, I simply run through my mind a short movie of how foolishly I have been acting. You may have better luck singing a silly song, or patting your head while rubbing your tummy, or doing whatever little trick helps bring you outside of yourself long enough to regain control.'
