Chelsea have beaten off a dramatic late intervention from Arsenal to secure the £10.5million signing of Loic Remy from West London rivals QPR on a four-year deal.

Remy's representatives were already in talks with Chelsea and the deal was in its advanced stages before Arsenal tried to hijack the move.

The former Marseille man told Chelsea's website: 'I feel very happy and very proud. When I heard Chelsea wanted me I said "let's go" because they are one of the best clubs in the world.

'I remember the amazing atmosphere at Stamford Bridge when I played there for Marseille and I can't wait to play for the first time in front of my new fans.

'I feel very proud and and very happy to join Chelsea today. For me it's a big thing. I'm really excited to join my team-mates and play my first game.

'I'm here for progress. I have a chance now to have quality in this kind of team. You want to win titles. That's why I signed.

'The best thing for me is to learn and learn quick because Chelsea is a big team and you have to be at that level all the time. I'm goign to try to do my best all the time.

'The fans will judge what kind of striker I am, but for me I think I can bring many things for the team. I try to be quick, I can score some goals and I can progress a lot. That's why I'm here.

'I played for Marsielle which is a big team as well but Chelsea is one of the best clubs in the world, they play in the Champions League so I'm very proud to be here.

'Chelsea already have two big strikers so that's another thing to make me switch on because I don't have a choice - I have to be at that level. For me the pressure is there but I will just try to do my best because I know what I can do.'

Progress: Loic Remy said he has joined Chelsea to progress as a player and to win titles 

The striker, who has been released to join up with the France squad ahead of their fixtures with Spain and Switzerland next week, had an £8m-release clause in his contract which both Arsenal and Chelsea matched. 

Chelsea became aware of Arsenal's interest late on Saturday but had done enough to tie up the deal, having started talks in earnest on Friday once Fernando Torres joined AC Milan on loan.

Arsenal made late a check on Loic Remy's transfer status ahead of tomorrow's transfer deadline.

The QPR striker has completed a move to Chelsea, but the Gunners enquired to see on how far his move to Stamford Bridge is down the line.

But it is understood the North London club were told that his move to Chelsea was virtually complete meaning Arsene Wenger will have to look elsewhere for a new forward.

Sources at the Emirates Stadium insist Wenger believes he has enough firepower in his squad to cope with the absence of Olivier Giroud.

And a deal for a new striker is looking increasingly unlikely as we head into the final hours of the transfer window.

Arsenal remain interested in Sporting Lisbon midfielder William Carvalho
