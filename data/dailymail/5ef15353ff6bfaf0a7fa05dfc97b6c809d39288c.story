A woman who battled infertility for four years after surviving brain cancer could hardly believe it when a pregnancy test  came back positive last November.

And 25-year-old Whitney Quinton's family were in an equal state of shock, as a heartwarming new video shows.

The mother-to-be from Alberta, Calgary, filmed the moment she and her husband Brett told their relatives the happy news over Christmas.

They told Daily Mail Online that it was such a happy occasion after 'months of disappointment' and 'lost hope'.

In the video's opening scene, a man is seen opening a small envelope and pulling out a message reading: 'Baby Quinton coming August 2015.'

As the words sink in, he suddenly tears up before going over to hug Mrs Quinton. 

Other people in the room mimic his actions, with one woman excitedly exclaiming: 'Are you serious?'

In the following scene, 29-year-old Mr Quinton tells his brother via Skype that he's going to be an uncle.

His mother is also in the room while the interaction takes place and she can barely contain her excitement over the fact she's going to be a grandmother for the first time.

She puts her hand over her mouth before breaking down in tears. 

Mrs Quinton reveals via her blog, brettandwhitneyquinton.blogspot.ca, that her fertility problems were linked to childhood illness.

At the age of 14 she started suffering from seizures.

Doctors found that the fits were the result of a brain tumor and they performed two surgeries to remove the mass.

While she was worried the invasive operation would impact on her life, Mrs Quinton went on to forge a successful career as a dental assistant and marry the 'man of her dreams'.

It was only when she started trying to conceive she discovered there was a problem.

At one point, with a high FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) level for her age, Mrs Quinton was told it was likely she would never have children. 

They said fertility treatment was unlikely to help the issue.

Smiles all around: Mrs Quinton said Christmas 2014 was by far the best holiday ever as she revealed her happy news

Happy ending: She concluded: 'To everyone out there who is dealing with infertility, don't lose faith'

Bundle of joy: The Quinton's child is due in August and there is currently no word on what sex it is.

However, last year she underwent surgery for endometriosis - a disease effecting the lining of the uterus - and that's when her luck changed.

Recalling the chain of events she wrote: 'The morning we found out, I was up at 5:30 that morning. 

'We both didn't need to be up for another hour but I took a test and when it came up positive, I started shaking. 

'The bathroom floor felt like quicksand and instantly it felt like a dream. 

'I called Brett's name and said I was pregnant. We both cried and couldn't believe what the test showed.'

Mrs Quinton said Christmas 2014 was by far the best holiday ever as she revealed her happy news.

She concluded: 'To everyone out there who is dealing with infertility, don't lose faith.  

'We have only become closer as a couple because of it. It was well worth the wait.'
