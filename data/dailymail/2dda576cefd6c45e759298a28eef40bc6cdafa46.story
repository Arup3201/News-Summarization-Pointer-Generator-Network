Arrest: Susan Sciacca, 55, was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, accused of pulling a gun on another driver in a road rage incident

A female attorney brandished a pistol and screamed obscenities at another driver after following him into a parking lot during a road rage incident last Friday, according to the alleged victim and Texas police.

Susan Sciacca, 55, was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon on Tuesday, accused of pulling a gun on John Leazer, 40, after he possibly cut her off on a suburban Houston highway.

Leazer, a married father of three, claims that he feared for his life when an 'enraged' Sciacca pulled up alongside him and got out of her car with a gun drawn.

'I'm basically scared. I honestly thought she was going to shoot me,' he told KHOU, after the attorney followed him into the parking lot of a bank in Tomball, off state highway 249.

Leazer says he called 911 and the whole incident was captured on surveillance footage. Officers arrested Sciacca at the scene, according to ABC News.

The woman is a Harris County attorney and works in Family Protective Services Divisions on cases involving abused or neglected children. She is now out of jail on a $30,000 bail bond.

Police say Sciacca has admitted that she pulled out a handgun but said that she was in fear of her life and that Leazer was the one who followed her into the parking lot.

Fear: John Leazer, 40, said he was in 100 percent fear of his life after he was followed by the woman and she threatened him with a handgun in the parking lot of a bank in suburban Houston

She has pleaded not guilty to the charges and her lawyer Dan Cogdelle told ABC: 'We expect her to be exonerated.'

Leazer disagrees, and claims he was '100 percent' in fear of his life. He explained to KHOU that he had just had lunch with his wife when he could have cut Sciacca off on the highway.

'Here I see an enraged woman holding a 
pistol to me, claiming she's an assistant district attorney with Harris 
County and that I have no right scaring her,' Leazer said.

He then said that she followed him into the parking lot. 'I
 open the door, I get out to walk into the bank, she comes screeching 
up... gun drawn,' he continued.

'I told her to put the pistol down. She told me no. 
While I have 911 on the phone, she's screaming obscenities and 
everything,' Leazer added.

The Harris County Attorney's Office stated that it is aware of the situation.

'We are continuing our review of this matter and are gathering additional information,' Robert Soard, Harris County First Assistant County Attorney, told ABC News.
