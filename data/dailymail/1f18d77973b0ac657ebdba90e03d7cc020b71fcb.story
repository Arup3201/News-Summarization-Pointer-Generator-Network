Salmon usually travel upstream, but recent floods led to an astonishing sight where a handful of fish were forced to swim up-street.

Heavy rains in Mason County, Washington caused water levels to rise by around two inches across Oregon.

When that happens the salmon go wherever the rivers are flowing, according to professional fisherman Conway Bowman, host of 'Fly Fishing The World,' a fishing show on The Sportsman Channel in the U.S.

'This can happen when high water correlates with the spawning season,' Mr Bowman told The Huffington Post.

Several intrepid salmon were pictured

The salmon's struggle upstream is a vital part of their lifecycle.

They lay their eggs in a stream bed and once hatched, grow in the freshwater for several years before travelling downstream to the sea.

They travel great distances to feed in the oceans and, when fully mature, after between one and four years, must return to their birthplace to spawn.

This means they must swim up rivers, against rapids and leap waterfalls.

Once they arrive, they lay their eggs and usually die within a week of spawning. A small proportion are strong enough to survive and start the cycle again.
