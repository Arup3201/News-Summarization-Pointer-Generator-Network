The pageantry and pomp of Britain's biggest ceremonial events could be diluted because of cuts to the Armed Forces, a senior officer has warned.

Garrison Sergeant Major Bill Mott, who has overseen occasions including the royal wedding, Baroness Thatcher's funeral and Trooping the Colour, said massive redundancies meant he was struggling to 'produce the same spectacle'.

The events, which showcase the magnificent sight of Britain's military personnel, are renowned across the world.

But GSM Mott, who has been in post for 12 years, fears the traditions could be undermined as the Coalition reduces the size of the Army from 102,000 to 82,000.

His comments are likely to prove especially sensitive as Prince Harry is now a staff officer in the same district as GSM Mott after completing his attachment co-piloting Apache attack helicopters with the Army Air Corps.

GSM Mott told Defence Focus, an internal Ministry of Defence magazine, that soldiers are 'gritting their teeth and getting on with it' in the face of the cuts.

He said: 'As we condense we have to conform to various restraints, and it becomes more and more difficult to still produce the same spectacle.'

GSM Mott, one of the last remaining Falklands veterans still serving, led the pallbearers who carried Baroness Thatcher on her final journey to St Paul's Cathedral.

He and his brother Major Nick Mott, who also carried the coffin, were aboard the Sir Galahad on June 8, 1982, when it came under fire from Argentine warplanes.

The attack cost the lives of 48 personnel, including 32 from the Welsh Guards, and left 150 Welsh guardsmen injured, including Simon Weston.

GSM Mott took up the post in 2002, and is one of the most senior non–commissioned officers in the British Army.

In his role, he is responsible for all ceremonial events in London, from providing guards of honour to orchestrating major occasions such as state visits, the State Opening of Parliament and the Queen's Birthday Parade.

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said ceremonial duties remained an 'important part' of the Armed Forces but the 'priority' was ensuring Britain had an 'effective fighting force'.
