Ever since splitting from Mario Falcone, Lucy Mecklenburgh has thrown herself full throttle into an intense exercise regime.

And
with each week that passes, the TOWIE star has been shedding inches off
her body to give her a more toned and muscular shape.

She has even seen off competition from Rihanna and Beyonce to be voted the best bikini body of 2013. And now, the 22-year-old has revealed the secrets behind her amazing new figure.

Get the Lucy look! Miss Mecklenburgh has revealed her health and fitness tips on her new website

Lucy has been working hard to film her new fitness channel Results With Lucy which focuses on problem areas like bottoms and tummies using a mixture of cardio and strength training.

The fitness site, which users must pay £3 to subscribe to, promises online personal training and dietary videos from the star.

Lucy explains that growing up as a teenager in Brentwood she believed she 
was always 'tall and skinny' but as she got older, she started to notice cellulite developing 
on her bottom and upper legs.

She said: 'I didn't have a lot of energy, I didn't feel healthy and I knew I needed to start training really.

'My biggest concern when I started training was getting too much muscle on my arms because I didn't want to lose the feminine look.'

She works out: Lucy, with trainer Cecilia Harris, 41, left, has said her hatred of cellulite that formed on her bottom and thighs kickstarted her fitness regime - and now it has become part of her life

Health kick: When it comes to her diet, Lucy works on cutting body fat levels with a diet full of vegetables, fruit, wholegrains and 'good fats' like avocados and nuts- she even makes her own sushi

She called in the help of personal trainer Cecilia Harris who taught her that regular exercise is the only way to achieve and maintain the body that she wants.

Lucy says she wants a body that is 'toned, strong and flexible 
but without looking like a female weight lifter'.

She then began to film her workouts to 'give everyone the chance to get the same training 
as her'.

Lucy follows a strict exercise regime focusing on an all-over body workout, including cardiovascular exercises like running, skipping and rowing.

She favours leg raises, exercises using dumbbells, lunges and plenty of sit-ups to achieve the toned midriff she has been flaunting in Marbella in recent weeks.

Showing them how it's done: She has begun to film her workouts and culinary skills after demand on Twitter

When it comes to her diet, Lucy works on cutting 
body fat levels with a diet full of vegetables, fruit, wholegrains and 'good 
fats' like avocados and nuts.

She also makes her own sushi at home, and looks set to be sharing her recipes on her website after so many fans tweeted her asking for her dietary advice.

'I still have and love my “cheat” days, but the best thing is, they’re now guilt free, as I know that I’m on top of it!,' she said.

And her new regime is obviously working and has left her feeling confident and healthy.

'I noticed a difference in myself, I felt
healthier, had lots more energy, I was more toned.

'I've lost all my cellulite, my body feels amazing and I've even started to get little abs,' she added.
