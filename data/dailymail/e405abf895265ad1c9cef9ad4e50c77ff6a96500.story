The British grandmother facing a firing squad for smuggling drugs into Bali did not learn of her fate until eight hours after the decision was made public, in a message from one of her sons in England who had seen the news on TV.

Lindsay Sandiford, 57, was told the Supreme Court had thrown out her final appeal. She told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The media found out at midday on Thursday, but I didn’t know until the evening.

'It beggars belief. The British consulate didn’t let me know. My lawyer didn’t tell me. Nobody thought to tell me.’

Sandiford, sentenced to death in January after being caught smuggling cocaine worth £1.6 million into Bali last year, has now exhausted the appeal process and can be spared by only a presidential pardon.

In messages relayed from her prison cell in Bali’s Kerobokan jail, Sandiford said: ‘I was expecting the Supreme Court appeal to fail. Even so, it is very harsh for me to deal with. We’re all going to die, it’s just that I know it won’t be old age or illness that kills me. Mine will be legal murder.

‘I’m not sure if I’m frightened. I  just hope my death is painless. My biggest regret is for my family – my sister, my two sons and my baby granddaughter, who I will probably never have the chance to know.’ 

Asked how she coped with the prospect of the death penalty, she said: ‘It’s a weird feeling – like looking at myself from a  distance .  .  . sometimes I forget, and sometimes I feel very down. There are extremes of all emotions.’

Sandiford’s death penalty has been heavily criticised by human rights advocates, including former Director of Public Prosecutions Lord Macdonald, who pointed out that  Sandiford insists she carried drugs only because of threats to the lives of her two sons.

Three other Britons suspected of being higher up in the drug smuggling operation – Julian Ponder, Paul Beales and Rachel Dougall – were given sentences of six years, four years and one year respectively.

Sandiford, of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, said she had been constantly taunted in jail by Ponder, who is serving his sentence in the same prison. He sneered at her when she walked past him with a prison official on Friday after learning her death penalty had been upheld, she said.

The court told the grandmother she had shamed Bali's tourism reputation 
by smuggling cocaine in the lining of her suitcase through the island's 
international airport

But she added: ‘There is the other side where people have been incredibly kind in the most surprising and unlooked for ways. I’ve been very touched by the care I’ve had from strangers here and the generosity of the British public in funding my appeals.’

Well-wishers donated nearly £11,000 through a JustGiving appeal for Sandiford’s Supreme Court hearing after the British government refused funds. Her family is now investigating whether more fundraising is needed for her plea for a pardon.
