Former TOWIE star Amy Childs and Countdown's Rachel Riley were the main attraction at this afternoon's first ever Soccer Six Fest at Mile End Stadium.

The event, billed as the 'biggest celebrity football tournament in the world', played host to a wide range of 'celebrities' including dancer Louie Spence, X Factor winner James Arthur, and singer Frankie Cocozza. 

Soccer Six was created in 1995, and has been played at various stadia around the UK, but 2014 sees the first ever Soccer Six Fest, combining both football and music.

The event took place at Mile End Stadium, the venue of the first ever Soccer Six match 19 years ago. 

Childs and Riley, two of the celebrities in attendance at Mile End, were quick to show off their football skills as they took to the pitch in Tower Hamlets.

Childs has been a West Ham fan all her life, whereas Countdown star Riley is a huge Manchester United fan, and even got presented with a shirt live on the show by United legend Ryan Giggs.
