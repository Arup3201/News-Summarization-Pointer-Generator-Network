Roy Keane finally made his return back into top flight coaching on Monday, as he started his new role as assistant to Paul Lambert at Aston Villa.

The former Manchester United captain last featured in the top flight as manager for Sunderland before he left his position as Black Cats boss in 2008.

And already the Irish coach was keen to settle into his new role as he shared discussions with Lambert at the club's Bodymoor Heath training ground.

Keane was expected to return to management with Celtic this summer but turned down the opportunity to instead take up a surprise role at the West Midlands club.

The former Ipswich manger also holds an assistant role with the Republic of Ireland but he looked ready to get started for Villa as he kept a ball close by - old habits die hard it seems.

Fans will be hoping that Keane can transfer his leadership skills over to a young side which often lacked a figurehead during a struggle against relegation last term.
