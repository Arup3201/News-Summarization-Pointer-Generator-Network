The grass wasn't greener for this  horse after he got trapped as trying to leap over a gate to enter a neighbouring paddock.

And while his name was Jester, it was no laughing matter for the 21-hand animal.

The black-and-white steed needed to be winched off the metal gate by a team of 10 firefighters  in Little Ness, Shropshire, on Saturday.

The desperate bid for freedom ended with his rear hips stuck on the top of the six bar gate while he tried to drag the rest of his body across.

Fire crews arrived at the scene shortly after 5.30pm and a specialist animal rescue team attended so Jester could be lifted to freedom.

Craig Jackson, of Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'When we arrived it was thrashing about quite a lot.

'It had quite a few grazes and bruises, it was quite stressed. But it was sedated and we managed to lift it safely off the gate.' 

The rescue took crews more than an hour to complete, but the lucky four-year-old escaped with minor cuts and bruises.

A spokeswoman told MailOnline the horse's condition was 'stable'. 

A farmer who owns a neighbouring field said: 'Poor Jester had tried to leap into a neighbouring paddock to get to the grass.

'It just goes to show the grass isn't always greener on the other side.'
