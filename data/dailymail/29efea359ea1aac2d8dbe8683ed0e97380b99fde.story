Homework: Children whose parents did badly at school are much more likely than others to fail at school themselves, according to new research

Children are held back in life by bad education rather than a poverty-stricken home, a major state study found yesterday.

It said that children whose parents did badly at school are much more likely than others to fail at school themselves, and end up working in low-paid jobs or not working at all.

But coming from a home with a low income has by itself no influence on how well a child does, the analysis said.

The findings from the Office for National Statistics were produced in an attempt to explain why social mobility – the chances of a child being better off than his or her parents – has fallen in Britain over the past four decades.

They provide powerful new support for the argument that the failure of children from working class and low-income homes to rise to take high-quality jobs with high earnings is rooted in the education system.

However they appear to undermine the claims of poverty-lobby organisations and supporting politicians who claim that poverty and deprivation do the most damage to the chances of children.

The report on ‘Intergenerational Transmission of Disadvantage’ was designed to guide politicians to the most important factors in childhood that lead children from poor families into poverty as adults.

It said that the educational level of parents had the biggest impact on how well children are educated themselves, on whether they are likely to grow up to live on low incomes, and on whether they will be able to afford to pay their rent, heat their home, eat well or take holidays.

Children whose father had a low level of education were seven-and-a-half-times more likely to have a poor education themselves than children with a well-educated father, the study said. A child of a poorly-educated mother was three times more likely to fail at school themselves than a child of a well-educated mother.

Children with poorly educated parents were five times more likely to be poor adults than children of well-educated parents. And children of poorly-educated parents were 11 times more likely to be ‘severely deprived’ as adults than children of well-educated parents.

A family is considered to be severely deprived if it cannot afford four out of nine basic expenses. These are paying the rent or the mortgage; keeping the house warm; being able to meet an unexpected bill; eating meat or protein regularly; having a week’s holiday; and having a television, a washing machine, a car or a phone.

But the study found that growing up in a poor home had no effect on whether someone was poor as an adult.

‘The individual’s assessment of their childhood financial situation is not a significant predictor of poverty once educational attainment is accounted for,’ it said. ‘This suggests that household income during childhood mainly impacts future life chances through the educational attainment of the child..’

It added: ‘There is no evidence of a relationship between severe material deprivation now and the financial situation of the household as a child once education is controlled for.’

The findings, the analysis said, are ‘consistent with previous research indicating that income itself is not the primary driver of poverty persisting through the generations.’

However, the ONS said that one other factor that did affect a child’s life chances was whether or not he or she was brought up by a single parent. Children growing up with a single parent are one and a half times more likely to do badly at school than those with two parents.

The findinds provide powerful new support for the argument that the failure of children from working class and low-income homes to rise to take high-quality jobs with high earnings is rooted in the education system

The findings were gathered from the EU-SILC survey carried out by the EU’s statistics arm in 2011. Eurostat questioned 13,500 adults in Britain about what their homes were like when they were 14. In all, the survey covered more than 200,000 people across Europe.

The findings come at a time of deep controversy over social mobility and how to increase it. This week the Labour Party responded to evidence that a high proportion of people in professional and well-paid jobs were educated in independent schools with a proposal that in future all public sector organisations should be made to publish information on the class backgrounds of employees.

Charities and pressure groups have been blaming poverty for the lack of social mobility in Britain. Oxfam, for example maintains that Government policies favour the super-rich and ‘decrease social mobility, increase poverty and create economic instability’. It wants to see higher minimum wages, higher taxation of the better-off, and more spending on public services.

However the ONS report is likely to give ammunition to Tories who want to see the re-establishment of the grammar schools that once gave a top-class education to selected children from working-class homes. Supporters of grammar schools point to the evidence that social mobility began to decline in the 1980s, following the abolition of most grammars.

In 2011 a large-scale independent study found that children with better-educated parents begin to forge ahead of others after they have left primary school and gone on to secondary school education.
