Police are struggling to stop a Sydney-based website from selling shoplifting tools as the administrator has managed to find a legal loophole.

The Sydney-based website, which will not be named by Daily Mail Australia, distributes a range of equipment for thieves which have been designed to remove security tags, allowing the shoplifter to remain undetected.

There are calls for the online store to be shut down but despite investigations from the National Retail Association, the website is currently not breaking any laws - even though it is distributing products that encourage and facilitate crime.

The website founder, who wished to remain anonymous, told Daily Mail Australia that they are doing nothing wrong.

The website even has 'how-to' videos, where a young woman in a pink bra demonstrates how to use the products to foil a range of different security measures to steal clothes, sunglasses and liquor

'We are not doing anything new, there are many companies selling these (products) both direct to the public and to stores,' he said. 

He also believes that shop owners should know that security tags are not an adequate measure to prevent theft.  

'There are currently no regulations on the sale of these products.'

The website is also used to distribute their own line of clothing and point out that they would never trust security tags with their own products.

'As we tell the stores who stock our clothing range, security tags should not be relied on as the only form of loss prevention.' 

The website has different tools which are used to unlock different security tags to facilitate illegal shoplifting

The brand is hugely popular with almost 30,000 people following their Facebook page. 

However it's not known how many people are buying the shoplifting tools, which they call 'rack masters'.

The website even has 'how-to' videos, where a young woman in a pink bra demonstrates how to use the products to foil a range of different security measures to steal clothes, sunglasses andliquor. 

Thieving is a hugely costly problem for the retail sector. Many organisations are working together to prevent the criminal activity.

‘Shop lifting is a massive problem in Australia, we’re looking at about $2.3 billion per annum,' Philip Burton from the National Retail Association told Seven News.

‘We’ve asked the police to investigate and to try and close this website down as quickly as possible,’ NSW Fair Trading Minister Matthew Mason-Cox told Seven News. 

However, one of the biggest problems which has allowed the website to remain open for five years in the Australian law. 

The legislation is being examined to potentially find a way to ban the distribution of these products. 

‘We’ll talk with the Attorney General’s department in order to see if there’s any legislative changes that might be appropriate to make sure that these things are not able to be sold within any Australian jurisdiction,’ Mr Burton told Seven News. 

In the meantime, the website continues to sell and promote their products and law enforcements cannot intervene.
