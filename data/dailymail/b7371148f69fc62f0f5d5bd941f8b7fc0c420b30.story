Barack Obama is set to call for a new push to reduce the world's nuclear arsenal today when he delivers a highly anticipated speech in Berlin.

The U.S. President will direct his argument both at Russia's Vladimir Putin and at Congress, making the case for a reduction of one third in the nuclear weapons held by the U.S. and Russia.

His speech at the iconic Brandenburg Gate will have a lot to live up to, drawing comparisons with John F. Kennedy's 'Ich bin ein Berliner' address, which took place almost exactly 50 years ago.

Mr Obama is also seeking to live up to a speech he himself made in 2008 while running for election, which drew 200,000 supporters and cemented his reputation as a global 'rock star' politician.

The President is expected to attract a much less rapturous reception at his speech today, scheduled for 3pm local time (9am EDT).

He will look to make an impact with another call for nuclear disarmament, following a number of past speeches arguing for a reduction in the world's stockpile.

The issue was at the centre of his foreign policy when he first came to office, but has since fallen down the agenda in the wake of turmoil in the Middle East and the continuing global economic crisis.

Mr Obama discussed non-proliferation 
with Mr Putin on Monday when they met on the sidelines of the G8 summit 
in Northern Ireland.

During his first term, the U.S. and 
Russia agreed to limit their nuclear stockpiles to 1,550 each as part of
 the 'New START' treaty, but he hopes to cut that figure by another 
third.

'The U.S. intent
 is to seek negotiated cuts with Russia so that we can continue to move 
beyond Cold War nuclear postures,' a U.S. official said ahead of the 
President's speech.

It is unclear whether Mr Obama is planning to negotiate a new treaty or merely to sign a non-binding agreement, which would not need ratification by Congress.

His calls for co-operation with Moscow come at a time of high tension between the U.S. and Russia, which have clashed over Syria's civil war and American missile defence plans in Europe.

Mr Obama will also press Congress to pass ban on nuclear tests, an initiative which has been in the works for years but has stalled recently.

It is believed that other than the U.S. and Russia, France has about 300 nuclear warheads, China 240, Britain 225, and Israel, India and Pakistan roughly 100 each.

Other than his landmark speech, the President planned to spend Wednesday in talks with German chancellor Angela Merkel and other top politicians including president Joachim Gauck.

He touched down with his family in the German capital on Tuesday night, waving to the crowds gathered at Tegel Airport.

His wife Michelle and daughters Malia and Sasha visited the city's holocaust memorial on Wednesday, accompanied by the President's half-sister Auma, who lives in Germany.

Five years ago, when he was still seeking election as President, Mr Obama received a rapturous reception on a brief tour of Europe where he was greeted as a leader who could give the world a fresh start after the controversial presidency of George W. Bush.

Now he is a much more divisive figure - 
although his re-election last year was welcomed by most Europeans, 
recent revelations about his administration's spying on internet 
communications have tarnished his record in the eyes of many.

Mr Obama's speech tomorrow will inevitably be compared with JFK's, which took place on June 26, 1963 at the Rathaus Sch√∂neberg, a few miles away from the Berlin Wall which had been under construction over the previous two years.

Kennedy's speech, considered one of his best, held up West Germany as a symbol of freedom on the front line of the battle against communism.

It featured the famous line: 'All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin, and therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the words, "Ich bin ein Berliner!"'
