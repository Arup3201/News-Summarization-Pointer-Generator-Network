A boat used by the U.S. Navy for target practice broke free from its mooring and drifted 4,000 miles across the Atlantic - eventually landing on a quiet beach in Cornwall.

The orange boat, known as a Low-Cost Tow Target, started its epic journey in Florida and is believed to have been cut off from its towing vessel, possibly by gunfire, on January 2 2013.

Over the next year it drifted east across the Atlantic before it was spotted by a man walking his dog on picturesque Perranporth beach on the North Cornish coast on Friday.

The St Agnes Coastguard rushed out as the boat was capsized and could have been a sailor in distress . As they arrived it was washing up on the beach and at first the crew had no idea what the vessel was.

They scraped barnacles away from a sticker and were surprised to discover it belonged to the American military.

'I've never seen anything like this before in the 10 years I've been a coastguard. It's in remarkably good condition,' said Station Officer Ivor Thomson.

'It's lucky it ended up on the beach, a mile either way and it would have been on the rocks and smashed to splinters.

'I think it's pretty amazing it came all this way completely unassisted. We had no idea what it was, we wondered whether it was something dangerous.'

HM Coastguard at Falmouth let the U.S. Navy know they'd found the boat. Perhaps unsurprisingly, American officers don't want it back.

The boat is now expected to be disposed of by North Devon Council.

Target ships are vessels used for naval gunnery practice or for weapons testing. Often they are obsolete or captured warships, but some are built from scratch.

The boat that was washed ashore in North Cornwall is believed to be a Low-Cost Tow Target. It is usually towed by a HSMST (High Speed Manoeuverable Surface Target).

It is an inexpensive alternative to state-of-the-art unmanned drone targets.

The U.S. Navy also employs the Low-Cost Modular Target (LCMT), a modular barge made from pontoons, scaffolding and large coloured sails, which can be shot at with guns or a variety of missiles.

Perhaps the most spectacular and famous example of the use of seaborne targets was Operation Crossroads, where 95 target ships were hit by two nuclear weapon tests conducted by the United States at Bikini Atoll in mid-1946.
