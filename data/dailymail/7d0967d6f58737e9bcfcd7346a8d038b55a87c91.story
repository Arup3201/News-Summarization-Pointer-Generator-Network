A daughter who stole her disabled mother's savings to buy 'basics' for her new home, including an iPad and a washing machine, has been jailed.

Theft: Blenkinsopp said she stole her mother's savings to buy 'basics' for her new house, including an iPad

Kerry Blenkinsopp, 34, stole a total of £2,600 from her mother Rosina, who was saving the money for adaptations to her home, which  she needed after suffering a stroke and being confined to a wheelchair.

When the devious daughter was rumbled, she said she spent the money on 'basics' for her new home - a £200 iPad, cooker, washing machine and a car.

Teesside Crown Court yesterday heard Blenkinsopp stole from a safe under a bed and helped herself to £800 because she wanted to move out and furnish her home.

Days later, as her mother was at hospital for physiotherapy, she took a further £1,800 before attempting to cover her tracks by calling the police to report a burglary.

Jailing her for eight months, Judge John Walford told the unemployed Blenkinsopp: 'In a dreadful betrayal of trust, you took advantage of her circumstances to steal money and then covered what you had done by a deception.'

Blenkinsopp, of Craven Street, Middlesbrough, has been disowned by her mother and family since the thefts in July.

They have also secured a restraining order to keer her away from her mother.

In a victim impact statement, Mrs Blenkinsopp, who sobbed in the public gallery during her daughter's sentencing, said: 'I want nothing more to do with her.'

Judge Walford told Blenkinsopp: 'To do anything other than impose an immediate custodial sentence would outrage the family - the victims of your criminal activity.

'The effect on your mother and your family as a whole has been profound.

'The effect has been both financial and emotional.

'Basics': Blenkinsopp also spent the money on a new washing machine and cooker, such as these pictured, for her house

'The money was earmarked for adaptations and improvements to her home, which the loss of the money means your mother can no longer afford.'

In mitigation Andrew Teate said Blenkinsopp wanted to reconcile with her family but accepted their wishes.

He said: 'It is her intention to fully repay her mother and make best the situation.'

Prosecutor Sharon Elves said Blenkinsopp quickly owned up to the police about the sham burglary because she felt as though they knew she was behind it.

Blenkinsopp admitted two charges of theft and one of causing wasteful employment of police time at an earlier court hearing.
