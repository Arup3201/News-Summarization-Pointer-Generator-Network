At least two of the three men involved in a possible Al Qaida plot to pull off an attack coinciding with the 10th anniversary of 9/11 are believed to be U.S. citizens or have U.S. travelling documents.

Their primary mission is to explode a car bomb in either New York or Washington, but if that proves impossible, they have been ordered to simply cause as much destruction as they can, one U.S. official said.

Word that al-Qaida had dispatched would-be attackers reached U.S. officials midweek.

A CIA informant who has proven reliable in the past approached intelligence officials overseas to say that the men had been ordered by newly minted al-Qaida leader Ayman al Zawahri to mark the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks Sunday by doing harm on U.S. soil.

The news comes as a massive security operation was under way in New York and Washington D.C. prompted after U.S. spy networks intercepted communications from an Al Qaeda operative in Pakistan.

The 'chatter' indicated plans to attack the capital and New York on the 10th anniversary of 9/11, a senior security source indicated tonight.

The news comes as thousands of anti-terror officers will flooded the streets tonight and radiation detecting boats were 
patrolling the water as America was put on heightened alert of a terror 
strike to coincide with Sunday's grim milestone.

Sources revealed the terror cell 
has been instructed by al Qaeda and could be targeting subways, tunnels and bridges around Manhattan, but other big 
cities, including Los Angeles and Chicago, are also on red alert.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, one U.S. official said on Friday there was reason to believe the threat may be linked to al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri.

Zawahri took the reins of al Qaeda after Osama bin Laden was killed in May in a U.S. raid in Pakistan.

The intelligence received this week included possible threats of attacks targeting subways or commuter trains as well as possible car bomb attacks in New York or Washington, U.S. officials said.

Freedom: Mayor Bloomberg said he was riding the subway as normal today to assure his residents that New York was prepared for any terror attack

New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said: 'We have to be concerned. Terrorism is theater and this is a stage, right now probably the world's biggest stage.'

Some senior officials however have poured cold water on the al-Zawahiri link, saying he has had only limited involvement in al Qaeda operations, knowing he is the primary U.S. target after the killings of Osama bin Laden in May and top al-Qaida strategist Abu Abd al-Rahman Atiyyat Allah last month.

'Bin Laden was more involved in al Qaeda operations than al-Zawahiri,' a senior official said. 'He's too busy trying to stay alive.'

Regardless, the White House believes some element of al Qaeda is behind the threat — just not al-Zawahiri himself.

New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg today rode the subway to work in a bid to assure his residents that New York is prepared for any terror attack.

He reiterated that the threat was 'credible' but said there 
was 'no reason' for Americans to 'lock ourselves in our houses and lose 
the freedoms that the terrorists want us to give up.'

'Are we increasing it a little more? 
Yeah,' the Mr Bloomberg said on his weekly WOR radio show. 'But there's a
 limit on how much you can have because you can't have a cop on every 
corner.'

Without giving specific details of the new threat, the mayor said it was being taken seriously because it wasn't 'outlandish'.

And after getting off the train near 
the Brooklyn Bridge, Mr Bloomberg urged New Yorkers to just: 'Go back to
 work. And leave it to the professionals.'

His words came as Vice 
President Joe Biden said that while intelligence on a potential terror 
plot against U.S. cities came from a credible source, there is 'no 
certitude' an attack has been planned.

Mr Biden said he and President Obama 
had been briefed on intelligence developed by the CIA that three men may
 have entered the country with the intent to launch a vehicle-bomb 
attack.

'We do have talk about using a car 
bomb. We've been told that was an intention... from a credible source,' 
Mr Biden said on Good Morning America. 'But we do not have confirmation 
of that. We don't have a smoking gun.'

However, a source told the New York Post: 'It does feel more operational than most of the others we’ve had that have been more aspirational.'

The information, which came from chatter
 picked up overseas by the CIA, said the attack would occur on the 10th,
 11th or 12th, another source told the paper.

Federal officials said yesterday that three 
individuals - one believed to be a U.S. citizen - entered the country 
last month by air with 'intent' to carry out a terrorist plot against 
Washington, D.C. or New York.

Police sources told reporters the 
individuals are believed to have come to the U.S. via Afghanistan or Pakistan with 
at lease one stop in another country, possibly Iran.

The FBI and Homeland Security 
Department issued a joint intelligence bulletin last night to law 
enforcement around the country urging them to maintain increased 
security and be on the lookout for suspicious activity.

'There is specific, credible but 
unconfirmed threat information,' the head of the FBI's New York 
division, Janice Fedarcyk, said.

'As we always do before important 
dates like the anniversary of 9/11, we will undoubtedly get more 
reporting in the coming days.'

Mr Bloomberg told 
reporters the city's observance of the attacks will go on as planned.

In Washington, law enforcement 
officials said they were working 12-hour days indefinitely, and Police 
Chief Cathy Lanier said unattended cars parked in unusual locations 
risked being towed.

Intelligence officials have warned of 'lots of chatter' on jihadi websites about the imminent anniversary of 9/11, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, pictured, said yesterday.

The department will be at a heightened level of readiness as the U.S. commemorates the anniversary but, she said, nothing yet warrants raising the terrorist threat status.

CNN reported Ms Napolitano as saying: 'We don't have something that would reach that standard, but we still have lots of chatter out there. And we take every bit of that seriously and are tracking it down.'

She said the anniversary would likely be an 'iconic' day for al Qaeda. But despite the heightened level of threat she declined to give out details of security preparations.

'I don't want to give those (details) out because I don't want to tell the bad guys exactly what we're doing,' she said.

'But I think it's fair to say that in addition to asking citizens to be vigilant and so forth, that we have ourselves leaned forward and have made sure that we are doing all that we can from the DHS perspective.'

Briefed on the threat information 
yesterday morning, President Obama directed U.S. 
counter-terrorism agencies to redouble their efforts, a White House 
official said.

A White House official yesterday told 
ABC: 'The President was briefed on this specific threat information this
 morning and has been updated on it throughout the day.

'The United States government has 
already significantly enhanced its security posture in advance of the 
9/11 anniversary to protect the country against possible terrorist 
threats.

'Nevertheless, the President directed 
the counter-terrorism community to redouble its efforts in response to 
this credible but unconfirmed information.'

As of late last night, there were no 
plans to change Mr Obama's travel schedule on Sunday in light of the 
threat, the White House said.

The president is scheduled to mark the
 September 11 anniversary with stops at New York's Ground Zero, the Pentagon
 and Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

He also will deliver a speech on Sunday night at a memorial concert at the Kennedy Centre in Washington.

The Department of Homeland Security, 
which said only last week that there was no credible information that al
 Qaeda was plotting an attack around the September 11 anniversary, 
declined to offer details on the threat.

It cautioned that there were always threat reports before important dates like the anniversary of the September 11 attacks.

Spokesman Matt Chandler said: 
'Sometimes this reporting is credible and warrants intense focus, other 
times it lacks credibility and is highly unlikely to be reflective of 
real plots under way.'

'Regardless, we take all threat 
reporting seriously, and we have taken, and will continue to take all 
steps necessary to mitigate any threats that arise.'

A second law-enforcement source played
 down an ABC News report about missing rental trucks - saying the 
vehicles had been recovered and there was no connection to terrorism.

At the press conference Mr Bloomberg spoke about 
additional precautions being taken in the event potential threats were 
confirmed.

The mayor said intelligence agencies have been on 'heightened alert' as the anniversary of the 9/11
 attacks approaches.

He advised New Yorkers not to change their daily routines but to be vigilant in reporting anything suspicious.

Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said
 heightened security measures would include increased bag inspections on
 the city's mass transit system, increased deployment of radiation 
monitoring equipment, increased focus on landmark, houses of worship and
 government buildings and increased bomb sweeps of parking garages and 
other locations.
