New satellite images taken above Syria have revealed the scale of the devastation in the country following four years of civil war.

Schools, hospitals and refugee camps are seen destroyed in towns and cities such as Aleppo, Kobane, Homs and ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa since the country was torn apart in 2011.

Initially a battle between various armed rebel groups and the Syrian regime forces, the Syrian Civil War has since descended into a conflict with hundreds of frontlines, as rebel groups fight among themselves and ISIS and Al Qaeda-backed terrorists seize vast swathes of land.

Before: This photograph showing the area around Aleppo's old citadel was taken of November 21, 2010 - a year before the Syrian Civil War broke out

And after: On October 22, 2014 - less than four years after the above image was captured - the area around Aleppo's citadel is seen largely destroyed

Monument: This photograph taken on October 12, 2011 shows the elaborate shrine to ancient Islamic icons Uwais al-Qurani and Ammar Ibn Yasser in the northern Syrian city of Raqqa 

Destroyed: The monument - which lies in ISIS-held territory - was sadly destroyed by militants in 2013 who said it distracted from the veneration of Allah. This photograph was taken on October 6, 2014

The satellite images form part a UN report due for release tomorrow that will present analysis of the impact of four years of war on the Middle Eastern nation.

UN investigators used their satellite program UNOSAT to gather the startling photographs which, according to an advance statement detailing the report, document 'indiscriminate attacks on civilian population, including barrel bombing, destruction of schools, hospitals, residential areas, markets, power plants and the vast cultural heritage of Syria.'

Comparing images taken shortly before the start of the war in 2011 with those captured in recent months, the UN has been able to show the geographical changes caused by relentless fighting between various groups, as well as the displacement of an estimated 6.5 million people.

The images emerged as the Syrian air force has carried out a chlorine gas attack on a northern town, killing six people, according to activists, as Amnesty International said separate government air strikes on the Islamic State 'capital' could amount to war crimes.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Local Co-ordination Committees said gas attacks on the town of Samrin injured dozens more people.

Historic: This photograph dated September 4, 2011 shows the ancient Syrian border city of Dura-Europos, which was considered a UNESCO world heritage site

Target: Holes in the ground around Dura-Europos reveal the extent of looting in the area by April 2, 2014

An opposition official in the area of this morning's chlorine gas release said there were two attacks - the first targeting rebels while the second hit a residential area. He said the six killed were members of the same family, including three children.

A military official denied the claims and blamed rebels fighting to topple President Bashar Assad.

Earlier, Amnesty International said air strikes on the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa on November 25 killed dozens of civilians.

The human rights group said it had documented a series of Syrian government air strikes between November 11 and November 29 that killed up to 115 civilians - including 14 children -  in the city.

Raqqa has been ISIS' seat since it declared a caliphate in areas under its control in Iraq and Syria.

Amnesty International said the 'unlawful' killings violated international humanitarian law and some of the attacks could amount to war crimes.

The London-based group said the air strikes included attacks on a mosque and a busy market 'crammed full of civilians' as well as some buildings not being used for military purposes.

Ravaged: Schools, hospitals and refugee camps are seen destroyed in towns and cities such as Aleppo, Kobane, Homs and ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa since the country was torn apart in 2011

Philip Luther, director of Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa programme, said: 'Syrian government forces have shown flagrant disregard for the rules of war in these ruthless air strikes. Some of these attacks give every indication of being war crimes.

'They have carried out repeated attacks on civilian areas without clearly identifying military targets, a blatant violation of the requirement to distinguish between civilians and military targets.'

Syrian authorities said at the time that the attacks were meant to target IS members and bases, but Amnesty said the evidence it gathered shows that, in most cases, no military targets could be identified.

On November 25, Syrian government forces bombed a number of civilian areas, striking a mosque, a busy market, shops, a transport hub, a storage facility and a residential building, Amnesty said.

Mr Luther said: 'The residents of Raqqa already have to endure the reality of life under brutal IS rule. Punishing an entire civilian population simply because the city where they live is now under IS control can never be justified.'
