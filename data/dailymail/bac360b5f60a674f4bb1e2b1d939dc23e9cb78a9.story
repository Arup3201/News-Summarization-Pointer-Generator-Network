While other toddlers are content to sit in  front of the television, Sherwyn Sarabi prefers to search for his favourite shows online.

That’s when he’s not too busy studying his inflatable globe or favourite encyclopaedia, of course.

The extraordinary two- year-old can identify all 195 independent sovereign states on a map of the world – and even match them with their national flags.

Sherwyn Sarabi is only two years old but is prodigiously talented - he can read, use an iPad and name all the countries in the world as well as identifying their flags

Sherwyn Sarabi loves to learn and was delighted when his parents bought him an encyclopedia

He can also read up to 500 words, 
describe all major body organs and their functions, count to 200, 
identify shapes and explain volcanoes and shooting stars.

Sherwyn, who goes to nursery two 
afternoons a week, said his first words at ten months and was playing on
an iPhone as though he had ‘had one for years’ by 18 months.

His abilities have stunned experts, as well as his parents Amanda, 35, and Daroud, 36.

Mrs Sarabi said: ‘He just loves to 
learn – he recently woke me up at 3am telling me all about Sir Isaac 
Newton and how he discovered gravity. We can’t go anywhere with him 
without him asking “Why? Why? Why?” about things going on around him.’

The former teacher, who has given up 
work to care for her construction worker husband as he recovers from a 
serious car accident, said they believed their son was exhibiting normal
behaviour until a trip to the doctor earlier this year.

Sherwyn has shown an interest in astronomy, begging his parents for a telescope, and can name all the countries on Earth, as shown here from space

She said: ‘He was looking at a map on 
the wall and started pointing out countries he recognised. The doctor 
said he’d never seen anything like it.

‘We then took Sherwyn to a consultant 
paediatrician who thought he was of above average intelligence.’ The 
family, from Royston, South Yorkshire, sought advice from educational 
psychologist Dr Peter Congdon, who runs the Gifted Children’s 
Information Centre in Solihull, West Midlands.

Dr Congdon has offered to assess 
Sherwyn’s IQ once he turns three next month, saying: ‘I don’t like to 
see children under three because it is only then that you can conduct a 
comprehensive assessment.’

Sherwyn’s parents hope he can start 
school sooner than his peers to stop him getting bored – and he has 
already been offered a scholarship to a local independent school.
