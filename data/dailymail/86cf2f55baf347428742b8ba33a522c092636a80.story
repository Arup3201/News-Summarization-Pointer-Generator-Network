Who will win the title this season?

Six-time Olympic champion cyclist Sir Chris Hoy has again been on the sharp end of abuse from disgruntled football fans after Chelsea supporters took to social media to vent their fury at referee Chris Foy.

Foy sent off Willian and Ramires, as well as Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, in Saturday's 1-0 loss at Aston Villa as the Barclays Premier League leaders' title challenge faltered.

Mourinho later called on the Premier League to stop sending Foy to officiate at Chelsea matches. Foy, meanwhile, is to be sent to Hull on Saturday by the Premier League for the match with West Brom.

One Twitter user called Sir Chris 'the worst referee I have ever seen', while another admitted: 'We were rubbish but Chris Hoy is a diabolical referee!'

Another user of the site meanwhile declared: 'Chris Hoy has had an absolute stinker today, awful referee.'

The mistakes were quickly picked up by others, while some even predicted Sir Chris was likely to receive abuse after being the subject of similar messages meant for Foy in the past.

Dan Walker tweeted: 'Poor old @chrishoy could be in for it tonight #FoyNotHoy #AVFC #CFC'.

Despite being one of the most famous Olympic athletes in recent times, Sir Chris's twitter feed was bombarded with messages criticising his 'performance' in the match on Saturday evening

Sir Chris started receiving the 
criticism after referee Foy gave two players, Willian and Ramires, as 
well as manager Mourinho, their marching orders during a fiery contest at 
Villa Park on Saturday.

It 
is not the first time the legendary cyclist has been mistaken for the 
football referee. In 2011 he was on the receiving end of insulting 
Twitter messages from Tottenham supporters who mistook him for Foy.

The referee had been in charge of Spurs' 2-1 Premier League defeat at Stoke, when the visitors had an Emmanuel Adebayor goal wrongly ruled out for offside, two penalty appeals for handball turned down and Younes Kaboul sent off.

One of those to get the pair's identities
 mixed up tweeted: 'Chris Hoy, not only are you a useless **** of a 
referee, you also support Stoke.'

Sir Chris seemed to be taking the tweets with a pinch of salt, judging by this response to a message of support from Dan Walker

Sir Chris was even advised to get another job, as users mistook him for the Premier League referee

Another posted: 'Robbed ! Chris hoy calls himself a premier league referee ! #mug.'

'Just for the record 1) I don't need glasses and 2) I do not lead a double life as an English Premier League ref. That's Chris Foy,' Sir Chris posted.

He continued rebutting the messages, adding: 'Still getting some rather amusing grief from Spurs fans! On the plus side I've learned some new 4 letter words today. #FoyNotHoy.'

But despite the ire from both Mourinho and Chelsea supporters, Foy - not Hoy - will be at the KC Stadium on Saturday, where Newcastle boss Alan Pardew infamously headbutted
 Hull midfielder David Meyler earlier this month.
