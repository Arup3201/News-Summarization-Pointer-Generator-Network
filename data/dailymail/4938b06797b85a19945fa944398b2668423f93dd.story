A former policeman insists selling Islamic state flags from his front yard was simply a shrewd business decision with the help from publicity that money can’t buy.

Melbourne resident Rob Boot claims within minutes of hanging the first ISIS flag from his front yard two weeks ago, a taxi driver, that he described as of Middle Eastern appearance, knocked on his door in Carrum, in the city’s southeast, and bought it for $40.

Ironically, when Mr Boot put the second flag out on display at 7am on Wednesday, he claims another taxi driver, who he also describes as being of Middle Eastern appearance, purchased it just five minutes later.

Melbourne resident Rob Boot plans to sell more ISIS flags as the only two he imported from the U.S. were snapped up within minutes of hanging them in his front yard in Carrum in the city's southeast

Mr Boot denies that by selling the extreme terrorist regime’s flags, which he purchased from a U.S. supplier, he is encouraging terrorism.

‘People who are inclined to do what I would call – wicked things - or have a wicked frame of mind – are already that way,’ he told Daily Mail Australia.

‘They are made that way through their acquaintances, or in their mosque they listen to Imams geeing them up, or they see poison on the internet and that gets them going.’

‘You may get the odd nut ball who wants to undertake something but I don’t think my flag is going to set him off.’

However, the shrewd businessman admits the timing of deciding to start selling the ISIS flags was far from a coincidence.

‘I know jolly-well what I’m doing when I hang up these contentious flags - it’s not happenstance - I do it simply to get the publicity,' he said. 

'The immediate aftermath is I get a huge amount of sales that lasts for several weeks afterwards which is publicity I couldn't afford to pay for.'

'I know what I'm hanging up in the morning and why and it brings people.'

Not a stranger to controversy, Mr Boot experienced a boost to his sales in 2012 after receiving publicity for selling Nazi flags.

This time around, he has received visits from the local police following complaints and even an ASIO agent asking him to assume the role of a ‘community leader’ by providing authorities with car registration details of customers who buy contentious items.

‘When people come onto my premises they come in good faith and  I enter into a contract with those people by selling them a flag,' he said.

'They trust me not to pass on their details and I don’t think it’s my job to do that.'

Mr Boot, who is not breaking any law,  will continue to sell ISIS flags if he can continue to buy them from suppliers.

The 62-year-old, who has been selling flags for five years, said he never asked customers why they chose particular designs.

‘I’m not interested in why they want it I don’t care if they want to hang it up as a curtain or outside their house or put it on their bed and have sex on it – I really don’t care,’ he said.
