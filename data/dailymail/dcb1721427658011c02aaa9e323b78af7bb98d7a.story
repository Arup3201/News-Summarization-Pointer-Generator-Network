Tiger Woods may not have had much luck in this week's Honda Classic, but at least he had the support of his 'new family'.

The world No. 1 was forced to withdraw from today's final round in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, due to lower back spasms which started during warm-ups this morning.

It was clear something was wrong as the 38-year-old struggled to hit good shots and stretched his back 
several times.

 

Disappointing: Tiger Woods was forced to withdraw from the Honda Classic today due to a persistent back problem

'New family': Lindsey Vonn and Tiger Woods' children, Sam Alexis and Charlie Axel, watched Woods tee off on the 11th hole during the second round of the Honda Classic golf tournament on Friday

Supportive: Lindsey Vonn cheered on Tiger Woods on Friday along with her beau's children, Sam Alexis and Charlie Axel

Champion skier Vonn was snapped toting around five-year-old Charlie and six-year-old Sam, Tiger Woods's children with ex-wife Elin Nordegren.

The trio wore green to support Woods, according to CBS Sports, with Tiger’s mother, Kutilda Woods, also on the green to cheer him on.

Vonn appeared particularly close to Sam, holding her hand in one photo and putting her arm around her in another.

Like her boyfriend, Vonn has experienced her own sporting troubles, missing out on the Sochi Winter Olympics due to a knee injury.

In the past: Tiger Woods and Elin Nordegren divorced in 2010 and have two children

The picture of a happy family is 
completely at odds with recent rumors that Wood and Vonn's year-long 
relationship is on the skids.

Vonn is rumored to have put the hard word on her beau, demanding that they get married.

ShowbizSpy.com reported
 that Vonn spoke with Tiger’s ex-wife, Elin Nordegren, who advised her 
not to pressure Woods into marriage - but Vonn didn't listen.

'Elin thinks Lindsey is good for Tiger but doubts their relationship will last,' a source said.

'She
 advised Lindsey to not put any pressure on Tiger, but Lindsey went 
ahead and did the complete opposite. She's demanding a commitment, and 
that just pushes Tiger farther away.

'When
 Lindsey hit him with an ultimatum, it started an argument. Tiger told 
her, ‘If that’s the way you feel, we need to rethink this whole 
relationship'.'

The source 
said Woods is not interested in getting married and having more kids, 
but Vonn is looking for a formal union for the security.

According to ShowbizSpy.com, Vonn is worth about $3 million, 'but Tiger is worth more than 100 times that'.

Like Woods, Vonn went through a very nasty, public divorce.

After
 splitting from fellow Olympian Thomas Vonn in 2011 - the divorce was 
finalized last year - she told Vogue she had no desire to re-marry.

Meanwhile, Woods is scheduled to play in this week's WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral, where he is the defending champion.

However his ongoing back injury could throw a spanner in the works.

'It's too early to tell,' Woods said about Doral.

'I'll get treatment every day to try and calm it down. Don't know yet. We'll see how I am, wait till Thursday and see how it feels.'

Woods said it was the same feeling he had at the Barclays last summer when he suffered back spasms in the final round and fell to the ground after hitting an approach shot.
