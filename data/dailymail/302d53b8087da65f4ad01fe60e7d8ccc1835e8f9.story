ARE you about to turn 29, 39, 49 or 59? Then you could be on the cusp of making big decisions, a study has found, with people more likely to make changes when they approach a milestone birthday.

Researchers analysed the responses of 42,000 adults from more than 100 countries who completed a survey about their values between 2010 and 2014.

They found that people with an age ending in nine were more likely to make changes ‘that suggest a search for meaning’ such as taking up marathon running or joining an extramarital dating site.

Lead author Adam Alter, from New York University, said: ‘People audit the meaningfulness of their lives as they approach a new decade.

 People tend to either conclude happily that their lives are meaningful or they decide their lives lack meaning.’

The team discovered that some people will engage in ‘productive behaviours’, such as taking up a new sport.

But Professor Alter added: ‘In contrast to this adaptive behaviour, some people might struggle to come to terms with the conclusion that their lives lack meaning. They might seek a socially damaging extramarital affair.'

Researchers found that men who have an age ending in nine - 29, 39, 49 - were much more likely to register for an extramarital dating site than men of other ages. Over a series of studies, the experts found that these so-called ‘9-enders’ were particularly prone to behaviour ‘that suggests a search for, or crisis in meaning’

A poll of 2,000 women found those who cheat are often following in their own mother's footsteps.

According to the research by Illicit Encounters site, seven out of ten women who cheat on their husbands have mothers who were unfaithful too.

Many women feel their mother's infidelity gives them 'permission' to cheat - and they consequently take their marriage vows less seriously.

Men are also more likely to stray if their fathers were philanderers - but not to the same extent as women.

For the first part of their study, the researchers analysed the responses of 42,000 adults who completed the World Values Survey - a large-scale questionnaire completed by people from more than 100 countries between 2010 and 2014.

They found that 9-enders reported thinking and questioning the meaning of life more than other respondents.

Subsequently, the researchers obtained data from an online dating site that targets people who are already in a relationship and found that there were far more 9-ender men - 18 per cent more - than would be expected by chance.

Further analysis found a similar, though less-pronounced, pattern of results for women.

Using government data, the researchers then examined the number of suicides per 100,000 individuals aged between 25 and 64 across the U.S. from 2000 to 2011.

The researchers also found that many people entering a new decade tend to engage in ‘productive meaning-seeking behaviours’, such as taking up a new sport. They randomly chose 500 first-time participants in one of five major marathons (stock image). Of that sample, 74 were 9-enders – ‘an overrepresentation of 48 per cent’

They found a small, but statistically significant, increase in the number of 9-enders committing suicide compared to other ages.

The researchers also found, however, that many people entering a new decade tend to engage in ‘productive meaning-seeking behaviours’, such as taking up a new sport.

They randomly chose 500 first-time participants in one of five major marathons in the US. Of that sample, 74 were 9-enders – ‘an overrepresentation of 48 per cent’.

They also analysed another set of marathon runners’ race times and found that people ran an average 2.3 per cent faster in their 9-end year than the two years before or after.

This suggested that they were more motivated and trained harder as they approached their milestone birthday, the researchers said.

The research paper was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
