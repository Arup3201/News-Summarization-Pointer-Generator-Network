The long-held credo that the customer is always right appears to have been lost on Sydney pastry salesman accused of an unsavoury attack on a man who complained there wasn't enough cheese on his takeaway gozleme.

Police say a 41-year-old man was taken to hospital and a 21-year-old charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and grievous bodily harm following the altercation at a cultural festival in Auburn, western Sydney about 5.20pm on Sunday.

It's alleged the 41-year-old purchased the Turkish pastry at a food stall but returned it a short time later, unhappy with the small amount of cheese on it.

There was an altercation over the amount of cheese in a gozleme at a cultural festival in Auburn on Sunday

When the 21-year-old stall owner tried to refund the man, the pair reportedly began to argue.

It's alleged the 21-year-old punched the older man in the head, causing a cut to his left ear, which required five stitches.

He has been granted conditional bail to appear in Burwood Local Court on August 26.
