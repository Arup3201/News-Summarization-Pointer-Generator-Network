As a professional golfer, he has earned prize money totalling £9.4million.

And yesterday, Ian Poulter was accused of being 'out of touch with reality' after complaining that his wife was forced to look after their children without a nanny.

The 38-year-old sportsman, who has won two world championships, had booked six business class seats with British Airways, for his wife Katie, their four children and their nanny.

Angry: The 38-year-old sportsman had booked six business class seats with British Airways, for his wife Katie, their four children and their nanny. But one of the seats was later downgraded by the airline

But when they arrived at the airport on Friday, they discovered one seat had been downgraded.

Poulter took to Twitter to complain, writing: 'Booked 6 business seats for my wife & nanny to fly home and British Airways downgrade my nanny so katie has no help for 10 hours with 4 kids.'

He then added: 'Amazing how British Airways have downgraded a full fare ticket when you buy 6 seats together in 1 booking. Just doesn't seem right.'

Perhaps unsurprisingly, many of Poulter's 1.7million followers failed to sympathise with his situation.

Professional: British Airways (right, file picture) reportedly offered Poulter (pictured, left, playing golf in March this year) £200 in compensation for the downgrade. It told the golfer it would be 'happy' to discuss the situation

One tweeter, Joe Walker, wrote: 'Some single mums aren't lucky enough to have a nanny. Or fly business class.'

Meanwhile, another said: 'My heart bleeds for you. Children are being killed in Gaza and you're crying because your wife has to look after her own.'

And one posted: 'Well done for distancing yourself from approximately 98.3% of the population.'

Poulter, whose profile picture is of his sportscar collection parked outside his multi-million-pound home in Orlando, Florida, was quick to defend his tweets.

No sympathy: Perhaps unsurprisingly, many of Poulter's 1.7million followers failed to sympathise with him

Sarcastic response: One tweeter, using the handle @MBPmufc, said: 'My heart bleeds for you. Children are being killed in Gaza and you're crying because your wife has to look after her own'

Not impressed: Another posted: 'Well done for distancing yourself from approximately 98.3% of the population'

He posted: 'I don't understand what the problem is. I work as hard as everyone else to provide for my family. So I can share my opinion. #Thank you.'

But tweeter Michael Richardson replied: 'You play golf... where [does] "working hard" come into it?'

Poulter also defended his and his wife's decision to hire a nanny, deeming his wife a 'brilliant' mother.

He tweeted: 'Actually, my wife is a real mum, we have the luxury of having some help, as it's difficult to travel with 4 on your own. Lots do it without.'

British Airways, which reportedly offered Poulter £200 in compensation for the downgrade, told the golfer it would be 'happy' to discuss the situation.

Poulter, who turned professional in 1996, is a member of the world's top two professional golf tours, the U.S.-based PGA Tour and the European Tour.

In 2010, he won the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, before scooping the title in the WGC-HSBC Champions two years later.

Family: Poulter, pictured above with his son Luke at a golf course last month, turned professional in 1996

As an avid car collector, he owns a Ford GT, Bentley Continental GT, a Ferrari California and has previously owned an Aston Martin DB9.

He is currently in Kentucky for the U.S. PGA Championship.
