It could be the move which would quite literally brighten up your life.

A historic lighthouse, which has been divided into holiday cottages, situated on top of a Highland cliff has gone on the market for just £210,000.

The keepers' accommodation at Stoer Head Lighthouse is to be sold by the Northern Lighthouse Board, as part of an assessment of the 'size and extent' of its estate.

On a clear day views from the lighthouse, which enjoys a beautiful, isolated spot, can extend for miles. But prospective buyers who are used to being a little closer to civilisation should be aware the nearest shops are about 12 miles away.

Historic: The former keepers' accommodation is currently used as two holiday cottages

The NLB, which has recently sold other assets at Strathy Point, Tod Head and Covesea Skerries, has said the accommodation is no longer required for safe navigation.

The property, which sits in the most westerly point of Assynt in north-west Sutherland, is currently used as two holiday cottages. The sale includes a quarter of an acre of land, although the lighthouse tower is not for sale as it is being retained by the NLB.

NLB chief executive Roger Lockwood said: 'The NLB is continually assessing the size and extent of its estate in order to ensure that it delivers a reliable, efficient and cost-effective network of Aids to Navigation for the benefit and safety of the mariner plying our waters.

'The former lighthouse keepers accommodation at Stoer Head Lighthouse and store near Rattray Head Lighthouse are no longer required for safe navigation. The NLB will continue to maintain over two hundred lights around the coasts of Scotland and the Isle of Man.'

On a clear day, it is possible to see Harris and Lewis, North and South Uist, and south to Torridon and Skye.

Closer to hand there are fine views of Suilven, Canisp, and Stac Polly, situated south of Lochinver.

The area is hugely popular with tourists and locals alike as the area is a great place to spot seabirds, whales and dolphins.

Designed and engineered by Thomas Stevenson, the father of Robert Louis Stevenson, the lighthouse's beam of light helped those at sea steer a safe passage through the deep waters.

The men given the difficult job of building the lighthouse stayed in a stone bothy which is now known as The Lighthouse Stores.

It was not until 1870 that the light marking the headland of the Point of Stoer was finally built.

Although the lighthouse at 45-feet is relatively short, its elevation above sea level is 177 feet.

A principal lightkeeper and an assistant and their families lived at Stoer Head until the light became automated in 1978. They were quite self-sufficient and nearby are the remains of the former byre, stable, cow shed, pig house and cart shed all built for life at the lighthouse station.

The lightkeepers' children were educated at Stoer Public School, however there were no senior schools in the county of Sutherland so the children had to continue their education away from the lighthouse at boarding school.

It is also ideal for those who enjoy coastal walks, mountaineering, geology, kayaking, fishing or who simply take pleasure from being out and about in the great outdoors.

Despite its isolated setting, the Stoer building is only around half a mile away from a scattering of houses at Raffin.

The nearest shops can be found at Drumbeg, or Lochinver, about 12 miles away.

DTZ Edinburgh has been appointed as property advisor and selling agent for Stoer's keepers' accommodation.

Senior surveyor for DTZ Richard Cottingham said: 'We are delighted to be instructed to sell such a historic property and expect considerable interest given the previous popularity of the former lighthouse keepers accommodation as holiday cottages.

'The lighthouse tower is to be retained and operated by the NLB but the remainder of the lighthouse compound is being sold.

'A nearby walled garden of just over an acre, including a stone steading, is also for sale and presents a unique opportunity for those looking for a more substantial development project.

'Offers will be sought for the lighthouse compound and garden individually or as a whole.'

The light is monitored from the NLB's offices in Edinburgh and is visited on a regular basis to carry out basic maintenance and cleaning. Once a year the NLB technicians visit the light to carry out maintenance.

Although the Stoer building is only around half a mile away from a scattering of houses at Raffin, the nearest shops are about 12 miles away
