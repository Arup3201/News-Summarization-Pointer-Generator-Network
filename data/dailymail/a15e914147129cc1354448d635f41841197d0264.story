When David Beckham spoke last year of how he gets up to cook breakfast for his children, it was hailed as a fine example of hands-on parenting.

But it seems that when it comes to the truth, no one bends it like Beckham.

His wife Victoria, 38, has now rubbished his version of events – saying that it is she who gets up to cook while David, 37, lies in bed – and jokingly labelled her husband a ‘liar’ in an interview with Elle, the same magazine that carried David’s initial claims.

Contradiction: David Beckham previously claimed that he woke at 6:45am on an average day to make his children breakfast. But his wife Victoria contradicted him and said that she often takes no the job

Last summer, David said that on a typical day he would wake up at 6.45am, before his children, to ensure ‘breakfast is all ready for them, cooked by me’.

He added: ‘My oldest son, Brooklyn, likes these croissants with jam on. My middle son, Romeo, he loves fruit, he loves mango and pineapple.

'Cruz loves Nutella on a croissant. And I have any scraps that are left over.’

But describing her typical day this week, Victoria tells how she gets dressed, checks her emails then ‘makes the kids’ breakfast’.

When told that her husband said last year that he makes the children’s breakfast, she said: ‘Well, he lied. He lied.

'Let me tell you now, he is not the 
one. I’m always like, “Go and shake Daddy and get him out of bed, tell 
him that he has to take you to school.” ’

The couple have four children, Brooklyn, 13, Romeo, 10, Cruz, seven, and one-year-old Harper.

The businesswoman whose fashion label is now renowned throughout the world said she never switches off.

She claimed she has not had a holiday for four years: 'A lot of people don’t have holidays. I’m a workaholic, David’s a workaholic.

‘We joke and say ‘One day when the kids are grown up, we’ll start with holidays.’
