Two people who were viewing a house had to be rushed to hospital after they plunged 14ft into the basement when the floor collapsed.

The man and woman - who have not been named - were walking round a £90,000, six-bedroom property in Nottingham on Saturday afternoon.

The potential buyer wanted to transform the Grade II listed building, which is described as being 'in need of a full renovation', into a dream home.

A man and woman were viewing the Grade II listed property in Nottingham on Saturday when the floorboards gave way and they fell 14ft giving them neck and back injuries

But the estate agent and a customer ended up being taken to hospital with head and back injuries after the ground floor of the end-terrace home gave way and sent them plummeting into the cellar.

In a statement Savills, who are selling the property, said: 'Two people were injured following an accident at a property located in St Ann’s, Sneinton, Nottingham over the weekend. 

'Our first concerns are with the two people hurt, one of whom is a Savills employee. We wish them a full and speedy recovery.

'We are fully cooperating with the investigation into the cause of this accident and is working with Nottingham City Council, which owns the building, to understand the cause.'

Emergency services said they were called to the boarded up home on Promenade, St Ann’s, Notts., at around 5.40pm.

A spokesperson for East Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'Two patients were at the scene. A female reported to have head injuries and a male reported to have back pain.'

Witnesses said the injured pair were passed through a window on a stretcher by paramedics following the fall.

Shop owner Jazz Singh, 31, said: 'My dad was here when it happened and when I started at seven o’clock all of the emergency services were here.

'They were bringing the injured people through a window on a stretcher.

Emergency services said they were called at 5.40pm and found a woman suffering back injuries and a man suffering head injuries before taking them to hospital

The pair had to be carried out through the window of the property while lying on stretchers

'You wouldn’t expect that to happen, people were a bit freaked out. It’s awful. I can’t believe it.'

Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, added: 'I saw two people being taken away on a stretcher, another woman in a suit walked out of the property. I assume she was the estate agent.

'You would think they would have checks in place to make sure that the homes are safe.'

Richard Pearson, 54, added: 'It was about quarter to six. I was nearby walking and saw the police car coming with flashing blue lights and a siren.

The fire brigade were forced to park in the surrounding roads as Promenade has no direct road access

'The house is up for sale by auction. Over the past week people have been going to view it.

'It sounded like something had collapsed with people on it. The outside of the building was completely intact.

Property website rightmove.co.uk were still offering viewings this afternoon and say that at the time of print an auctioneer had not been to the house

'It caused quite a commotion - all of the flashing lights continued - I was there for an hour and they stayed for that whole time.

'It sounds like quite a big fall - it’s horrendous, you wouldn’t think something like that would happen.

'It’s worrying. You wonder about the safety aspects of some of the other houses around.'

Property website rightmove.co.uk was 
still offering viewings this afternoon inviting people to look around 
the lounge, formal dining room, breakfast kitchen, cloak room.

A
note on the website added: 'At the time of going to print the property 
has not been inspected internally by a member of the auction team.'

The property is due to be sold by Savills Auctioneers on behalf of Nottingham City Council next Thursday.

A description of the property reads: 'A unique opportunity to acquire a substantial Grade II listed end of terrace property set within an established convenient location.

'Six bedroom accommodation of approximately three and a half thousand square feet offered in need of full renovation.'

Promenade is a small row of mostly three-bedroom terraced houses which overlook Victoria Park in Nottingham.

Located towards the North East of the city centre prices on the street vary from £90,000 to £135,000 with an average of £93,000.
