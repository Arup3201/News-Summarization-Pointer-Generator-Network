Nathaniel Clyne has revealed the story behind the tattoo on his left arm, illustrating him as a three-year-old child holding a football.

The Southampton defender was given his first England call-up by Roy Hodgson last week for the upcoming Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia and the friendly at Scotland.

But despite the future looking bright, Clyne remembers where he came from, and the striking ink is a representation of that. He also has London landmarks tattooed on him, including a phone box and Big Ben.

‘The tattoo is of me as a baby holding a football — it’s actually a picture of me in my mum’s house and I thought it would be good to get it written on to my arm,’ he said.

‘I was about three at the time. I always wanted to be a footballer and I followed my brother because he was always playing in the park.

‘I’m proud of where I’m from. I grew up in Stockwell, which wasn’t bad. My mum has always been there and she took to me games when I was younger. She follows my progress now.'

With England top of their qualifying group with no sign of danger ahead on their way to France, Clyne and England have a chance to express themselves over the next week.
