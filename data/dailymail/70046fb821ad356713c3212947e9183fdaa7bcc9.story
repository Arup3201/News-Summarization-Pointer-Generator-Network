Key clue: Fialho is believed to have swallowed the bunch with the intention of passing them and freeing himself later or selling them to another inmate

A convict who secretly swallowed handcuff keys was busted when a full-body X-ray scan revealed they were lodged inside his chest.

Ramon Eduardo Mendez Fialho somehow got hold of the bunch and consumed them shortly after being sent to prison in Montevideo, Uruguay, last week.

It was reported that he hoped to excrete them and either use them to escape next time he was cuffed or to sell to other inmates.

But Mendez didn't realise that bosses at Santiago Vazquez prison had recently upgraded their security and had installed a state-of-the-art X-ray machine.

Eagle-eyed officers soon detected a foreign body inside the convict's stomach after he had passed through the scanner.

On closer inspection the image, which has been released by the Interior Ministry, showed two tiny keys designed to open handcuffs.

It's still unclear how Mendez obtained the keys, and an investigation has been launched by prison chiefs.

Orestes Leles Da Silva, sub-director of security at the prison, praised the recent upgrading of security at the facility.

'Before,
if a person had come into the prison with something metallic like 
handcuff keys in their body, it would not be detected', he told El Pais.

'Today, thanks to this new system, we were able to detect the prohibited item', he added.

Hard to swallow: The criminal was only busted because full body scanners had been recently installed at the prison in Montevideo
