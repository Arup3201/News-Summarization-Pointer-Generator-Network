A 15-year-old girl was sent home on the first day of high school last week because her red hair was too 'distracting' to other students.

However, Muscle Shoals High School sophomore Hayleigh Black says she's been dying her head bright red for the past three years and no one at the school has complained before.

'I have never had anybody come up to me and say, "Maybe you shouldn't have this color," or, "Do you think that's a bad color,"' Hayleigh told WAFF.

Now, Hayleigh and her parents are threatening to sue the school unless they excuse her absence and let her dye her hair back.

Distraction? Hayleigh Black, 15, was sent home from school on the first day last week because her red hair (left) was too 'distracting'. She has since stripped the color (right) so as not to miss more class time

Turned around: Hayleigh's mom Pam Boyd had to pick her up from Muscle Shoals High School less than 30 minutes after dropping her off for the first day

Hayleigh's mother Pam Boyd said she got a call less than 30 minutes after dropping her daughter off on the first day of school - before Hayleigh even made it to homeroom.

Administrators allegedly sent multiple students home that day for distracting hair colors, which is violates a student handbook rule against 'distracting' or 'disruptive' hair styles.

Boyd says she knows about the rule, but didn't think her daughter was in violation since she's never been sent home for her red hair before.

'I told the principal, I said, '"You were her assistant principal last year. How come you never sent her home last year?" It's the same color as always,' Boyd told ABC.

Hayleigh says she's been dying her hair for three years now, and never received a complaint about it at school before

While the principal has not offered an explanation for Hayleigh's dismissal, schools Superintendent Brian Lindsay told ABC that he stands by the decision.

'The principal is just following the policy. Several girls were sent home for hair color,' Lindsey said. 'Most everyone complied and came back and are back in class.'

'The policy was put in place years ago,' Lindsay said, adding that it 'very rarely ever comes up as an issue' and was created to 'provide a safe environment conducive to learning.'

Hayleigh complied with the school's policy and has since stripped the color out of her hair.

She was allowed back in school the following day, but her parents intend to fight the absence and petition the school's administration to let their daughter re-dye her hair.

'She's been a little down,' Boyd said. 'She misses her hair color. I'm upset for her. I just felt very angered that my child - a good student, no problems ever - is having her feet knocked out from under her on the first day of school.'

If the school does not agree to the family's terms, they intent to file a federal lawsuit.
