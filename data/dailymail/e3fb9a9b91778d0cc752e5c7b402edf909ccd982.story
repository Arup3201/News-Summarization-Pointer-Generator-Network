Nine of the Italy squad which flew to Brazil were forced to downgrade to second class when it emerged their plane was too small.

The Azzurri arrived in Rio on Friday morning before travelling on to their training base in Mangaratiba, a seaside resort 75 miles south of the capital.

But nearly half of their players were told there was no room in the business class section of the Alitalia flight and spent the 12-hour journey in economy seats.

Ciro Immobile (Torino) 24 years old, 2 caps

Alessio Cerci (Torino) 26 years old, 12 caps

Matteo Darmian (Torino) 24 years old, 1 cap

Mattia Perin (Genoa) 21 years old, 0 caps

Antonio Mirante (Parma) 30 years old, 0 caps

Lorenzo Insigne (Napoli) 23 years old, 5 caps

Mattia De Sciglio (Milan), 21 years old, 11 caps

Andrea Ranocchia (Inter) 26 years old, 13 caps

Marco Parolo (Parma) 29 years old, 4 caps

That group included Ciro Immobile, the Torino striker who top scored in Serie A last season, and he was joined by Alessio Cerci, Matteo Darmian, Mattia Perin, Antonio Mirante, Lorenzo Insigne, Mattia De Sciglio, Andrea Ranocchiaand Marco Parolo.

At least star striker Mario Balotelli paid a visit to his comrades, posting a picture of himself with Insigne and Immobile on his Instagram account.

Italy kick off their World Cup campaign against England in Manaus next Saturday but their build up has also hit turbulence, an embarrassing 1-1 draw with lowly Luxembourg their sorry send-off on Wednesday night.

But coach Cesare Prandelli claims Italy's form - they are without a win in seven matches - is irrelevant when it comes to their preparations for the finals.

'I didn't see anything worrying, quite the opposite,' he said. 'Right now we don't need to be talking about results. You need to look at the physical condition of the players, and we are in great physical condition.

'Yes, we're missing a bit of flair and oomph for now but the point of this preparation is to arrive in Brazil in the right manner.

'Psychologically a player going to the World Cup just wants to get through that match (Luxembourg). We didn't put in tackles and we didn't go in with huge determination or will to win.'

Main man: Star player Andrea Pirlo (pictured arriving in Brazil) will be key to Italy's chances

Dressed to impress: Balotelli looked the part as he arrived in Rio

Safe hands: Gianluigi Buffon will be charged with manning the posts for the Italians
