A severely obese man has told how he managed to lose 300lbs in 18 months after telling himself that he 'deserved better'.

Mark Monacelli, 34, from Michigan, developed an unhealthy relationship with food as a child and gradually his 5ft 10in frame came to tip the scales at 480lbs.

But desperate to 'get married, settle down and grow old with someone', he revealed to the Huffington Post that in 2012 he took drastic action to turn his life around.

Dramatic transformation: Mark Monacelli, 34,  managed to lose 300lbs in 18 months and get the woman of his dreams after telling himself that he 'deserved better' - he overhauled his diet and adopted exercise

'What changed was figuring out that I deserved better,' he said.

'I deserved a life, a family, love, everything I had always hoped and dreamed of growing up.'

In a bid to fight the bulge he overhauled his eating habits - which meant giving up cookies, pizza and late night binging sessions - and adopted exercise.

'When I finally got down to a size that's about normal, 
people started saying, "You're too skinny, you look unhealthy, eat a 
burger"'

He also saw a therapist, who addressed his depression and anxiety issues.

At first Mr Monacelli  was losing around 15lbs a week.

'It was tough,
 but considering death was the alternative and happiness could be right 
around the corner,' he recalled.

'I stuck with it. I got a job as a cook and went back 
to college. This summer I picked up biking, and the most I did in a 
single day was about 24 miles.'

While he was overjoyed with his progress, he was surprised when friends suddenly started telling him he was 'too thin.'

'When I finally got down to a size that's about normal, 
people started saying, "You're too skinny, you look unhealthy, eat a 
burger."

'It's really tough to hear that kind of stuff. It's almost as 
bad as hearing, "You need to lose weight."'

Other assumed Mr Monacelli had had weight loss surgery, which he also found frustrating after all of the hard work he had put in.

'I feel pretty darn good about myself now. I still have issues with my 
body, but I'm definitely healthier'

Concluding on his weight loss journey so far, Mr Monacelli, said: 'I feel pretty darn good about myself now.

'I still have issues with my 
body, but I'm definitely healthier. I 
still don't always see the man I've become in the mirror.

'But I can tell
 myself that reality is different now, and all of those negative 
thoughts will go away with time.'

He now weighs 180lbs and estimates that he has up to 20lbs of excess skin as a result of his dramatic transformation.
