Fernando Torres has officially joined AC Milan in a two-year loan move that will allow the striker to see out the remainder of his Chelsea contract in Italy.

The 30-year-old  brought his three-and-a-half year stint at Stamford Bridge to an end  after completing a medical in Milan on Sunday - the same day Chelsea announced the £8million signing of QPR's Loic Remy as a replacement.

Torres, in the crowd for Milan's Serie A opener against Lazio at the San Siro on Sunday, was confirmed as their newest No 9 before the 3-1 win.

Torres's deal with Milan ends in June 2016, which coincides with the expiry of his current Chelsea contract.

The Spaniard, who joined Chelsea from Liverpool for £50m in 2011, stressed how keen he is to impress new manager Filippo Inzaghi.

'I cannot wait to start this new adventure,' Torres told the Milan Channel. 'I spoke to the coach yesterday and I am really pleased to work with a coach like him.

'He was a great goal-scorer and definitely understands what the role of a striker is. I am sure that he can teach me and help me a lot in this adventure.' 

'I was close to joining Milan when I was at Atletico Madrid (in 2007), but we’re talking about many years ago, a long time has since passed. 

'I’ve now finally arrived at Milan. Playing for Milan isn’t easy. It’s an honour and a privilege to wear this shirt. I want to give my best and help the side have a great season.' 

Torres, greeted by about 200 fans at the Milan Linate Airport on Saturday, will wear the No 9 shirt, as worn by Inzaghi and Dutch legend Marco van Basten.

'It would be a privilege to wear the number 9 jersey and to play at the level that everybody expects from me,' he continued. 'I thank the fans for the welcome.

'I am sure that it will all go well. I can promise that I will give 100 per cent and that with their help this experience will be fantastic and for many years I hope.'

Torres - acting as a replacement for Mario Balotelli, who joined Liverpool for £16m in August - forced Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho to look elsewhere before the transfer market closes on Monday. 

The Blues beat off a late intervention from Arsenal to secure their own £8m replacement in the form of Remy on a four-year deal, and confirmed the deal on Sunday afternoon.

The striker's representatives were already in talks with Chelsea, before Arsenal tried the hijack.

The former Marseille player told Chelsea's website: 'I feel very happy and very proud. When I heard Chelsea wanted me I said "let's go" because they are one of the best clubs in the world.'
