Marvel Comics has run into trouble for its 'blatantly sexualised' cover of the new Spider-Woman comic.

The comic will be in the shops in November and has two covers, one by Greg Land and the other by Milo Manara who is best known for his erotic illustrations.

The one by Mr Manara features Jessica Drew as her alter-ego Spider-Woman – 'a woman with a mission' who 'just won't abide … being a target' – on all fours with her backside in the air and what looks like bodypaint rather than a costume.

Too rude for Spider-Woman? The sexualised cover that is getting the critics up in arms

The comic – launched at Comic-Con in San Diego last month – will be written by Dennis Hopeless and illustrated by Greg Land but it is the alternative cover that has stoked anger from critics.

The character of Spider-Woman comic first appeared in Marvel Spotlight #32 (cover-dated February 1977) as a one-off but was so popular she featured in a 50-episode series (April 1978-June 1983) before being killed off.

In 2009, she was reborn in a seven-part series by Brian Michael Bendis. The new series written by Dennis Hopeless will be the third iteration. Spider-Woman's origin and basic character were designed by Archie Goodwin, while her visual appearance was created by freelancer Marie Severin. 

'If you're wondering what the hell Jessica Drew, aka Spider-Woman is doing, I believe it's what's known in the animal kingdom as "presenting",' wrote science fiction site io9. 'She looks like she's wearing body-paint, and that's a big no-no for an industry still trying to remember that women exist and may perhaps read comics and also don't want to feel completely gross when they do so. As for the position she's in … Christ … Here's a simple rule: If it's inappropriate for a male character, it should also be inappropriate for a female character.'

Laura Sneddon, a comics expert who blogs at comicbookgrrrl, told The Guardian that 'women do love superhero comics, and we even love a bit of cheesecake here and there, but this cover and the lack of thinking behind it is a prime example of why people continue to think superhero comics are for horny men only.'

She added: 'I think it's a really disappointing decision by Marvel editorial to choose this kind of artist for a variant cover on a female-lead comic. There's a time and a place for Milo Manara's style of work, but it's in erotic comics rather than superhero comics, or at least he could be asked to reduce the sexualised lens for this very different audience.'

Pop culture site the Mary Sue added that 'anyone familiar with pornography knows this pose … ripped straight from the fantasy medium', pointing out its similarity to one Manara had already drawn in an Italian erotic comic.

'This is what we talk about when we ask comic publishers not to actively offend their paying (or potentially paying) customers,' wrote the Mary Sue's Jill Pantozzi. 'It's important to note, Manara is known for erotic art, and there's absolutely a place for that. But was he the best choice to promote this particular comic? I would say unequivocally no.'

Marvel has yet to respond, but Mr Hopeless tweeted: 'I can promise you we have no intention of blatantly sexualising any of the characters in our story', and 'I don't have any input at all on covers. You have my word that our story treats Jess with the utmost respect.'

Marvel is trying to attract a bigger female audience and this summer said that its new comic Thor would have the Norse god as a goddess.

'The new Thor continues Marvel's proud tradition of strong female characters like Captain Marvel, Storm, Black Widow and more,' the publisher said at the time. 'And this new Thor isn't a temporary female substitute – she's now the one and only Thor, and she is worthy!'
