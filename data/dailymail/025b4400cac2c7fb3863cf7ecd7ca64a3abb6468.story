At least five people were shot at a California club night hosted by R&B singer Chris Brown.

Brown was singing his hit song Loyal at Fiesta in San Jose when a fight started and five people opened fire, police say.

Four victims were transported to hospital with gunshot wounds at 1.20am on Sunday, and a fifth later walked in. They are all expected to survive.

Brown tweeted the footage with the caption 'I'm 100', meaning 100 per cent.
