Let down: Jeanette Goodwin, 47, had made seven reports to Essex Police from January last year about harassment and domestic violence from Bunch before he murdered her in a horrific knife-attack

A police force has been slammed for failing to dispatch officers to a woman who warned them five times she felt scared shortly before she was stabbed to death by her ex lover.

Jeanette Goodwin, 47, was murdered in a horrific knife-attack at her home in Southend, Essex, in July 2011.

Her jealous former lover Martin Bunch, 44, had stalked the mother of three for months before stabbing her more than 30 times.

The obsessive ex had been unable to accept his eight-year affair with the married mother-of-three had come to an end and attacked her in front of her husband of 21 years, Mark Goodwin

And today, an Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) report has revealed a string of failings by Essex Police and the justice system to deal with Bunch, who was jailed for life for the killing.

Mrs Goodwin had made seven reports to police from January last year about harassment and domestic violence from Bunch.

And on the day of her death, the personal assistant had again phoned police at 2.40pm to report further harassment, stating five times that she was scared and that Martin Bunch had been at her garden fence.

But, amazingly, the member of police staff in the control room failed to even note on the log that she was scared and no background or intelligence checks were made.

Police then had no further contact that day until Mrs Goodwin pressed a panic alarm installed at her home at about 7.40pm.

But by the time officers arrived, Bunch had repeatedly stabbed Mrs Goodwin, leaving her to bleed to death on her garden patio.

Obsessive: Martin Bunch, 44, had been unable to accept his eight-year affair with the married mother-of-three had come to an end and attacked her in front of her husband at her home in Southend, Essex, right

The IPCC report concluded that limited
staff on a busy day meant that the fateful phone call from Mrs Goodin 
was not treated as an urgent matter.

Rachel
Cerfontyne, IPCC Commissioner, said: 'The system in place was badly 
flawed, not utilising intelligence checks to inform decision-making when
prioritising incidents.

'The call taker’s perception of Mrs Goodwin’s calmness and her stated intention to go out shopping were wrongly used as a reason not to dispatch officers.

Devastated: Bunch was seen mouthing offensive comments from the dock at Mr Goodwin (pictured) as the grieving husband gave evidence during the trial.

'There was a failure to recognise, in 
the light of the known history of this case, that Mr. Bunch’s presence 
close to her home, in breach of his bail conditions, required immediate 
and urgent action to try and arrest him.

'He
had clearly become obsessed with her, his persistent stalking and 
harassment were strong indicators of how dangerous he was.'

The report stated that although police had taken Bunch’s actions seriously in the months leading up to the killing, there had also been failings from the courts to put the jealous former lover behind bars.

Bunch was convicted of battery on June 21 - just a month before the murder - yet he was given just a conditional discharge.

Police had also arrested him three times for breaching his bail conditions following a separate incident including for having removed his electronic tag, yet twice he was released by the magistrates’ court on bail.

The IPCC investigation said police had taken Mrs Goodwin’s reports of domestic violence seriously from the outset, putting Bunch before the courts on several occasions, strongly urging his remand in custody, on the basis it was the only way to effectively protect Mrs Goodwin.

Mrs Goodwin had a safety alarm installed in her home and officers help develop a mutit-agency a safety plan.

As a result of the IPCC investigation, four members of police staff working in the force control room and one police officer have received performance debriefs from a senior officer.

Investigation: A forensic tent in the back garden of Mark and Jeanette's family home where she was found collapsed on the ground. The IPCC report concluded that limited staff on a busy day meant that the fateful phone call from Mrs Goodin was not treated as an urgent matter

None of the failings were judged to be misconduct though.

Reacting to the findings, Mrs Chambers’ family said in an emotional statement: 'Bunch on many occasions had been arrested for his part in harassing Jeanette.

'Bail conditions were set and he was repeatedly tagged which he showed complete disregard to by ultimately removing these, enabling this murderer to get even closer to our Jeanette, until finally the justice system allowed him to commit the unbelievable act of murder.

June 21 2011 - Bunch is convicted of battery against Mrs Goodwin (pictured) and given a conditional discharge.

June - Bunch arrested again for harassment and an allegation of actual bodily harm, unrelated to Mrs Goodwin.

June - Magistrates release Bunch on bail despite police pleas to have him remanded in custody for Mrs Goodwin's safety.

June/July - Bunch arrested a further two times for breaching his bail conditions.

July 14 - Bunch arrested and later bailed for a third breach of removing his electronic tag.

July 24, 2.40pm - Mrs Goodwin phones police and tells them she is scared five times. Her fears are not logged and no background checks are made.

July 24, 7.40pm - She sounds panic alarm but police arrive too late due to understaffing.

July 24, 8.10pm - Police arrest Bunch at his mothers house after he confesses to murder.

'This criminal system has to change and the appropriate measures must be taken to ensure that these tags cannot be removed and that criminals for stalking or domestic violence repeatedly breaching bail must be given a mandatory prison sentence before this horrific crime is committed to another loving mother.

'Unfortunately we will never know whether this would have had an impact on saving Jeanette’s life, but we would hope that it will help other victims. We are determined to do all that we can to ensure MPs and the Ministry of Justice take action and revise the justice system and the law.'

Assistant Chief Constable of Essex Police, Derek Benson, said: I have apologised to Jeanette Goodwin’s family for our failings.

'The IPCC report found shortcomings in respect of four members of police staff and one acting police sergeant. The IPCC concluded that their actions did not amount to misconduct but did require debriefing with a senior officer to address performance measures, which has been done.

'The initial call on Sunday, July 24, 2011, by Mrs Goodwin, should have been treated more seriously, and a unit dispatched.

'Too much emphasis was placed on Mrs Goodwin saying she was going out and would not be in until 4.30pm, rather than her stating she was scared of Bunch. There is however no way of knowing if our actions at this time had been different whether Mrs Goodwin would still have been murdered.

Sentencing Bunch earlier this year Judge Charles Gratwicke branded the killer 'savage and brutal'.

He said: 'Consumed with jealousy and twisted by anger, you decided that if she wouldn’t be with you she could not be with anyone else.

'You have demonstrated a total lack of remorse for what happened and hostility to the family in court.

'Your actions towards the family during this trial have been loathsome and disgusting.'

Bunch - who was described as ‘smug’ - was seen mouthing offensive comments from the dock at Mr Goodwin as the grieving husband gave evidence during the trial.
