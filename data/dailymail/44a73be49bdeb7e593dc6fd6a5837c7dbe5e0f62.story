Carl Froch will have to wait for his big Las Vegas farewell against Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr after the world champion injured his elbow in training last week.

Almost all the details had been agreed on a March 28 fight that would have brought an end to Froch’s stellar career.

But Sportsmail can reveal that an injury three weeks into his training camp has forced Froch to temporarily scrap his plans. His promoter Eddie Hearn is already in talks to rearrange the fight with dates considered in late April and early June.

Hearn said: ‘Carl is devastated but given the scale of the fight and the fact it may be his last, he didn’t want to take any half measures by fighting injured.

‘We were very close to concluding negotiations so as you can imagine it was heartbreaking for Carl to make the call. But we are already looking to reschedule the fight.

‘Everyone knows Carl’s desire to fight in Vegas so we are doing what we can to make it happen. I fully believe it will happen, but he rightly does not want to go into what might be his last fight with an injury.’

Rumours of Froch’s retirement spread on social media on Sunday evening after Froch tweeted a picture of a pair of gloves hanging up.

Hearn insisted the WBA and IBF super-middleweight champion’s priority remains one last fight, having last fought in his remarkable Wembley rematch win against George Groves in May.

Froch had reiterated his hopes for a Vegas fight earlier this month, saying: ‘Dare I say it, but we’re nearly there with the Chavez fight in Las Vegas which we’ve long talked about.'

But he said on Monday: 'I'm disappointed to have to let this opportunity go but at this stage in my career I have to make every fight count. 

'I will get some treatment and then we will look to make this fight or another big fight in the early summer.'
