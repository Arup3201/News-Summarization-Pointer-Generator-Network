He's one of Hollywood's most tech-savvy directors, but don't expect James Cameron to be fan of Twitter or Facebook - he thinks they're a waste of time.

'I 
don't want to be that available to the world. I don't want to share 
every single thing I do,' said the maker of computer-generated blockbusters Avatar and Titanic.

'I look around the airport, and every single 
person is oblivious to the world around them. They don't live in the 
moment.'

'High-tech Luddite': Avatar and Titanic director James Cameron told USA Today he isn't a fan of Facebook or Twitter

The 59-year-old told USA Today his rejection of smartphones and social media is his choice.

'I've made a conscious choice to not spend all my time ... 
looking down at a device. I refuse to do it. So there you have it. I'm a
 Luddite. But I'm a high-tech Luddite,' the Canadian film maker said.

'I was the first person I knew to have a
 cellphone in my car in 1983. At that point it was intriguing. Now I 
just see it as a ball and chain.'

Cameron, who found fame with his 1984 film The Terminator, said he doesn't have a Facebook account. He has a Twitter account but hates using it.

'I hate it. I hate everyone else's 
tweets, too. They're boring,' he said.

'What can you say in 140 characters? I can't
 even clear my throat in 140 characters.'

However Cameron admitted he owns an iPad which he likes to use on set.

'It's a good tool. You can have your previews loaded on it, cuts loaded on it. You can have the newest special-effects shots come in for approval. It's useful,' he told USA Today.

Cameron's revelations may come as a surprise to movie buffs, as the director is known for using state-of-the-art technology to bring his films to life.

For his latest work, Deepsea Challenge 3D, the director built a vertical submarine with 
an elaborate self-made 3-D camera system which he ran underwater. He talked to USA Today about overcoming some filming challenges.

'How do we get a 3-D camera system small enough to have 
multiple cameras on inside the sub that are automatic, so they can just 
run themselves while I'm flying the vehicle? We had to create a new 
camera system from the sensor board up, and put them in housings,' he revealed.

The movie opens in theaters on August 8.
