One of the brothers suspected of carrying out the Charlie Hebdo attack was mentored by a terrorist linked to London’s notorious Finsbury Park mosque.

The revelation will raise concerns about British links to this week’s terrorist atrocity in France.

Cherif Kouachi, 32, met Djamel Beghal, 50, who was once accused of being Osama bin Laden’s main European recruiter, while in prison in Paris.

Notorious: Kouachi was mentored by terrorist Beghal, who has links to London's Finsbury Park mosque

He maintained his links with the Al Qaeda lynchpin after being released from jail.

Kouachi, who is on the run after Wednesday’s attack on the Paris satirical magazine, was secretly photographed by French intelligence officers meeting Beghal while he was under house arrest in Murat in central France in April 2010.

Also present were two other convicted terrorists, jihadi recruiter Ahmed Laidouni and Algerian Armed Islamic Group member Farid Melouk.

Beghal attended hate cleric Abu Qatada’s prayer meetings in London, and is also said to have been a ‘constant presence’ at the Finsbury Park mosque in the late 1990s, when it was Abu Hamza’s base.

He allegedly recruited the shoe bomber Richard Reid and Zacarias Moussaoui, the ‘20th hijacker’ in the 9/11 attacks, at the London mosque.

Knowledge: Reda Hassaine (pictured), who worked as a paid MI5 informant inside the Finsbury Park mosque in the late 1990s and early 2000s, said Beghal was a well-known figure there in this period

Beghal, who also had links to Leicester, is also said to have met one of Osama bin Laden’s key deputies at the former Al Qaeda leader’s base in Afghanistan.

The terror leader spent ten years in prison in France for planning attacks. He was only released in 2010.

Reda Hassaine, who worked as a paid MI5 informant inside the Finsbury Park mosque in the late 1990s and early 2000s, said Beghal was a well-known figure there in this period.

He said Beghal had connections to both Abu Qatada and Abu Hamza, and had been influenced by their teachings.

‘Their warped view of the world has filtered down through him to a new generation,’ he told the Daily Telegraph. ‘What happened in Paris was the legacy of Abu Qatada and Abu Hamza.

‘A completely new generation, who have never met these people in London, have learned their ideology indirectly and are now willing to die in jihad.’
