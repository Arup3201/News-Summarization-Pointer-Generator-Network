As every husband and father will confess, all men need one area at home where they can retire to escape the chaos of family life.

Some blokes have a shed at the end of the garden. Others have a hobby room or a garage full of DIY power tools. But my sanctuary is somewhere rather more surprising. Indeed, you might say it's a space that no self-respecting heterosexual man should admit to occupying.

For my little corner of paradise in the 15th century, four-bedroom cottage I own with my wife, Claire, and our two children, Zac, 13, and Mimi, nine, is a specially designed dressing room just off the double bedroom I share with Claire.

It is here that you will find my life's passion. It's not filled with shelves of vintage vinyl records or old programmes from football matches, but racks and racks of shoes - 60 pairs in total - all carefully polished and lined up in order of season, occasion and colour.

By contrast, my wife's measly collection - she owns just 15 pairs - is crammed into a small wardrobe in our bedroom to make space for mine.

You see, in our marriage it is me who has a footwear fetish. And while many men may guffaw into their pints, it turns out I am far from alone.

A new report claims men, not women, are giving Imelda Marcos a run for her money.

Revealing statistics from market researchers, Mintel, has revealed that men in my age bracket, 35 to 44, spent £157 on shoes in the last year, against £138 for women.

The difference is even greater among 16-to-24 year-olds, with younger men spending £154, 15 per cent more than females of the same age.

If only my desire for shoes cost so little, then perhaps I wouldn't have to suffer the endlessly withering looks from my wife (whose own weakness, by contrast, is handbags) when I return home with yet another shoebox under my arm.

For despite the fact I own so many shoes that I wear a different pair every single day, I simply can't resist buying more. And it's an obsession that so far has cost me well over £10,000.

Looking back, I probably inherited my love of footwear from my Italian father. He took great pride in his appearance - from the bottom up - and I remember he had an electric shoe-shiner with a spinning brush which, from the age of ten, he allowed me to use to polish his extensive collection of expensive Italian shoes.

I still own and wear some of my father's shoes today. And because I look after them so well they remain, forty years on, in mint condition.

But my collection doesn't stop here. I have seven pairs of trainers, including four pairs of the brand New Balance in different colours. It's what all the Hollywood A-list celebrities are wearing and I have them shipped over from the USA.

Then I have winter moccasins and summer moccasins, as well as ten pairs of Tods driving shoes – made famous by Princess Diana. It's not enough for me to have just one pair of Tods in brown leather, even though they cost an eye-watering £200. If I like a shoe I will always buy it in black and brown - and sometimes then in different varieties of brown.

Right now, I am coveting a pair of Crockett and Jones loafers in a kind of hazelnut shade, even though – shamefully – I have another pair in a not-so-far-off chocolate hue.

But I don't understand it when I'm accused of being excessively metrosexual. I might have to have a pair of shoes to match whatever outfit I'm wearing, but how can men only own two or three pairs of shoes? Surely you need to wear an appropriate shoe for an appropriate occasion whether you're at work, at home, on holiday, in town or in the country.

Certainly, my desire for footwear knows no bounds and has been at the root of many marital disputes. Claire would walk everywhere barefoot if she had the choice and struggles, on occasion, to understand why I must possess trainers in red, blue, grey, nutty brown and suede.

Yet I know, deep down, she is secretly proud of the fact that I like to look good. It's probably my shoe habit that attracted her to me.

I have two pairs of Gucci shoes – one brown suede with a silver buckle and the other black patent with a silver buckle that cost £180 each in 1997. I was wearing one of them when Claire and I first bumped into each other in a pub in London. I'd like to say our eyes met across the bar, but that wouldn't be true. She was, in fact, staring in wonder at my feet.

'Claire would walk everywhere barefoot if she had the choice and struggles, on occasion, to understand why I must possess trainers in red, blue, grey, nutty brown and suede'

I always judge a man by his footwear. Cheap shoes, cheap individual. The most expensive pair of shoes I own are Crockett and Jones lace-up ankle boots which cost £475. They're same Daniel Craig wore in Skyfall. You could never accuse James Bond of scrimping on style.

Richard Cope, Mintel's principle trends analyst agrees with me. He insists that men are more worried than ever about their appearance and taking more time to 'groom' and stare in the mirror.

'We're seeing men occupy previously 'feminine' space in the home - spending more time on housework and parenting - but also as consumers, embracing yoga, beauty goods, and the act of shopping itself.'

Former Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos famously had a collection of almost 3,000 pairs of shoes

Certainly, for me, bagging a new pair of shoes to bring home is all about the thrill of the chase. It's a bit like the early days when you're dating someone. I do all my research first, comparing prices and styles. Then I linger for a while and savour the moment. It's the feeling of wanting them on my feet more than anything else that increases my desire. And then I strike.

Most women, whilst professing to be fellow shoe lovers, are clueless as to when the best time is to shop for shoes. You should never go at the end of the day because your feet will be swollen and your size will fluctuate. Ideally, you should be your shoes around lunchtime. I go when Claire is at work or otherwise occupied.

Right now I'm in the early stages of a relationship with yet another pair of New Balance trainers – this time in a slightly different shade of blue. I know I have to have them. But for now, I'm enjoying the feeling of thinking about them and imagining how they're going to look when they're lined up next to the others. The only question I'm pondering over is whether to put them with my summer or winter collection.

You can accuse me of being obsessive if you like. You can even question my masculinity. But there's no denying that as far as footwear goes, I'll never be caught short.

What was it that Elvis Presley said in a now-famous television interview? 'I think I have something tonight that's not quite correct for evening-wear. Blue suede shoes.'

That just goes to prove my point. He really should have had a pair in black leather, too.
