Breaking Bad stars Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul - who played meth kingpins Walter White and Jesse Pinkman respectively - have been lauded for their roles in the Emmy Award-winning series which drew to a dramatic close on Sunday.

However before the gritty roles - Cranston has described the complex character of White as 'the role of my life' - both actors were struggling to make it in Hollywood.

Prior to their career-changing roles, there was a long line of forgettable parts. In a compilation from Snakkle, the pair are seen in everything from hemorrhoid cream and microwave pizza ads, to game show appearances and small roles including one alongside Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible 3.
