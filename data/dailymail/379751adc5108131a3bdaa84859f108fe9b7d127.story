Victoria Beckham turned forty this year but with her glowing skin and svelte frame, she's looking younger than ever.

So
 how does one half of the world's most powerful A-list couples, mother 
to four young children and head of a burgeoning fashion empire stay 
healthy and super trim?

If her recent tweets are anything to go by, the former Spice Girl has upped her health regime since hitting her landmark birthday.

Victoria has tweeted her love for a host of superfoods, the most recent being acai berry - renowned for aiding weight loss.

The acai berry is a rich purple palm fruit indigenous to the Amazon rainforest. For hundreds of years, these small dark berries have been integral to the diet of native Amazon people.

The berries are packed with amino acids, as well as vitamins A, B, C and E and minerals such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, copper and zinc.

The fruit perishes quickly after being picked, so to help preserve its goodness it is often made into acai berry juice, supplements or powder, which is often whizzed into a smoothie.

Speaking about the potent powder, food blogger and nutritionist Deliciously Ella said: 'Acai is unbelievably rich in antioxidants, with one of the highest levels ever tested (eight times that of blueberries and 10 to 30 times that of red wine,) as well as vitamin E and omega-3s, all of which work to stop free radical damage and keep your body.

'It’s also amazing for keeping your skin glowing and slowing down the signs of ageing.'

According to some sites selling acai products, the berry's fibre and essential fatty acid content contribute to its ability to burn fat more efficiently, process food more quickly, cut down on cravings, and boost metabolism.

Victoria isn't the only fan of acai; health aficionado Miranda Kerr once said in an interview: 'I sprinkle it on my porridge, gluten-free cereal or smoothie.'

A prolific tweeter, Victoria also tweeted her love of another one of her favourite healthy food supplements: bee panacea.

Bee panacea combines all the components of bee products, including raw honey, pollen, propolis, and royal jelly. It is also packed with algae, herbs, botanicals and probiotics, making it one of the most nutritious and effective superfoods available.

Victoria has long been a fan of bee pollen, which is widely considered one of nature's most complete nourishing 
superfoods because it contains nearly all of the nutrients required to 
function by humans, including amino acids, B-complex, and folic acid.

It is said that bee 
pollen boosts energy levels, can be used topically to soothe skin 
conditions, curbs cravings and even acts as an aphrodisiac.

It comes as no surprise that Victoria has been focussing on boosting her health regime - the busy fashion designer has just unveiled a sneak peek of her AW14 Victoria, Victoria Beckham collection - and it's full of embellished minis, crisp polka-dot shirts and soft cashmere jumpers.

The 40-year-old fashionista has teamed up with American photographer Todd Hido, who has created a sultry and somewhat kooky campaign for her new range.

Victoria, Victoria Beckham describes itself as 'the playful younger sister to the style icon's eponymous main line. A collection of light, bright and breezy pieces, make space in your wardrobe for relaxed shift dresses adorned with charming details.'

The mother of four unveiled her range at an event thrown by e-tailer Net-a-porter in Manhattan on Monday.
