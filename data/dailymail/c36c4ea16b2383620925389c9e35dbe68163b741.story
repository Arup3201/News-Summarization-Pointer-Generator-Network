She was so passionate about her skin products she managed to convince Sir Alan Sugar to invest in them.

But Apprentice winner Leah Totton has admitted she wouldn't use her own skin products on herself - even though she's hoping to make a fortune out of them.

Leah, 24, won £250,000 investment from Lord Sugar to launch clinics offering anti-ageing cosmetic treatments such as Botox.

She may have won £250,000 investment from Lord Sugar to launch clinics offering anti-ageing cosmetic treatments such as Botox but Apprentice winner Leah Totton says she won't use the products herself

But today, asked if she would use any of them on herself, she replied: 'Not at the moment. These treatments are anti-ageing so they're not appropriate for women in my age group.

'Anti-ageing procedures aren't appropriate for a woman my age unless they have problems like excessive sun damage.'

In an interview with OK! magazine, Leah defended herself from accusations that she's not a 'proper doctor' and that she's promoting dangerous treatments.

She added: 'I can't believe some of the things people have been saying. They've said I'm not really a doctor, I'm not really 24, I've had a facelift - but none of it's true.

Leah said she has been offended by people who have accused her of having lip-fillers because it's a sensitive area

'What really hurts is when people say that I've had lip fillers. If you look at my school pictures you will see my lips were even bigger then. It's actually something I was picked on for so it's a sensitive area.'

Meanwhile, Leah also said she would not consider breast implants.

She said: 'I don't need a boob job. I've never had any cosmetic surgery. But I don't judge women who do. I understand there's a pressure on women to look a certain way. But surgery is not for me.'

Leah also responded to criticism 
about her rival Apprentice finalist and friend Luisa Zissman using her 
looks and figure to try to get ahead in business.

She added: 'My looks have never worked to my advantage. Perhaps they will in future. But looks can only get you so far.'
