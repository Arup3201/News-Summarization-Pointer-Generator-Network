Manchester United will be without Marouane Fellaini for the remainder of Christmas and New Year after it emerged the Belgian has a rib injury.

United manager Louis van Gaal has put Fellaini’s absence from the squad down to a mystery ‘virus’, revealing after Friday's win at home to Newcastle that the giant midfielder would not figure against Tottenham on Sunday.

However it is understood that Fellaini is also nursing injured ribs suffered in the win against Liverpool a fortnight ago and it is this that is expected to side line the former Everton player a little longer.

As a result of this problem Fellaini is not expected to return until after the FA Cup third round tie at Yeovil a week on Sunday.

Van Gaal has been given better injury news about other players with Daley Blind, Marcos Rojo and Luke Shaw all close to a first-team return.

Blind and Rojo could travel to Yeovil, while left-back Shaw is in contention for the Tottenham game.

Adnan Januzaj, the Belgian winger, will be assessed on Sunday after missing the Newcastle game with a virus.
