Daryl Janmaat believes Newcastle’s turnaround is evidence of a united dressing-room behind boss Alan Pardew, as he declared: ‘We do not want another manager’.

The Magpies travel to Manchester City in the Capital One Cup fourth round on Wednesday with back-to-back victories in the Premier League having hauled them to the relative comfort of 14th.

The upturn in fortunes has lifted the spotlight on Pardew, who had been the odds-on favourite in the top-flight ‘sack race’.

But the mood in the black-and-white camp is good as they head to the Etihad Stadium, and summer signing Janmaat said: ‘We want him (Pardew) – we do not want another manager. We have proved that.

‘If you lose games then it is normal (the manager is under pressure), but now I expect the pressure to ease on him. It’s nice that we have given him those points.’

Pardew tore in to his players after an insipid first half at Spurs on Sunday and it was a ploy which paid dividends as they emerged after the break to claim a 2-1 victory.

‘After the first half the manager was angry,’ revealed Janmaat. ‘He said to us, “if you play like that you cannot win games”. Afterwards, he gave us a compliment and was very passionate, he said “if you play like that you will win games”.’

It will be a big ask for Newcastle to make it past City, especially with the club having gone on the record in stating that cup competitions are not a priority.

But Janmaat insists the players take little notice of such policies.

‘Of course, the cup is very important,’ said the £5million former Feyenoord full back.

‘It is a prize and Newcastle have not won one since 1969. It would be a great party if we won a prize. The fans want that very much.

‘And we need them. It is an extra man for us, the 12th man. They were fantastic at Spurs.

‘That has given us hope ahead of this game. City have a big squad and a great squad – even their second team is very good. It will be a tough game. But if we play like we did in the second half at Spurs, then of course we have a chance.

‘We’ve had a great start to the week. We want to win the next two now (City and Liverpool at home on Saturday).

‘We needed those points but we need to be higher in the table. Two wins in a row after a draw has been very good for us. But we still have to improve and now we have confidence to do that.’
