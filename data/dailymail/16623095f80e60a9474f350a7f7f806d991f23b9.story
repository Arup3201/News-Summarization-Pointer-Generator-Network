No, the richest fight of all time has not been set in paper, let alone stone.

Not yet.

Yes, the lines on the contract still wait to be dotted, let alone signed upon by Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao.

But yes, also, the big businesses needed to help generate the prize-ring’s first £200million bonanza are swinging into action already. 

The travel industry, especially.

Air and accommodation packages have now gone on sale here in Britain for the second half of the week ending Saturday, May 2 in Las Vegas.

Cost – anything up to £4,000-a-head for deals based on flights in economy.

The MGM Grand – the giant resort and casino on that neon Strip in the desert – has been keeping its Grand Garden Arena on hold for some time now.

More significantly it has just raised its basic room rates for the nights of May 1 and 2 – by more than treble to in excess of $500 (£325) for the first time.

Other hotels in Vegas are also hiking their prices. 

All the above are selling like hot cakes.

Everyone is gambling that the deal of the century will be done.

Packages to watch the potential £200million bout are already on sale with some companies

It is believed that ringside seats will cost $5,000 (£3,250) each, with the pay-per-view subscriptions in the US being priced at $100 (£65) each... if it happens. 

The only thing which might bring it all crashing down in is a premature announcement that the fight is truly on.

One of Mayweather’s stipulations is that he makes the announcement.

Pacquiao has publicly conceded that privilege. But wishful media speculation that he has signed a contract, supposedly based on information from unattributed sources close to the Filipino camp, threaten to crush the hopes of the boxing world, the PacMan himself included.

Mayweather does not like that. He dismissed the story out of hand when he attended the NBA All-Star game in New York at the weekend, when many expected him to declare the fight on: ‘It’s not true. I’ve not signed yet. He’s not signed yet. It’s all speculation and rumour.’

The Money Man’s Showtime TV paymaster Stephen Espinosa confirmed: ‘There is no contract yet. Sorry to tell the truth.’

Still, there were sighs of relief all round when Mayweather added: ‘Hopefully we can make it happen.’

Maybe the thought of the fortune to be made softened his stance a little.

The most recent estimates suggest that Mayweather stands to bank a minimum of $150m (£97m), Pacquiao at least $100m (£65m).

There are suggestions that only two sticking points remain to be unglued, one between Showtime and the HBO television network who deal with Pacquiao, the other involving two rival beer breweries who each sponsor one of the boxers.

WBC President Jose Sulaiman is blaming the delay on 'abuse of power'. Although he is not sure by whom.

Sulaiman, on a flying visit to London said: 'It could be one or both the fighters, promoters, the managers, or the TV stations but I want to make it clear its not us.'

Mayweather is this organisation's world welterweight champion and Sulaiman adds: 'We are doing everything possible to remove any obstacle from this happening. It's not fair to the fans if they don't make this fight, which everyone wants to see. It will be terrible it it doesn't happen this year because it would be bring so much greater exposure to boxing and transform the sport.'

Even so, he raised the prospects of it happening this year rather than next as 'no better than 50-50.'

Meanwhile, the long wait goes on. But even as it does so boxing lovers the world over, in their anxiety about missing out, are gambling on advance bookings.

In terms of his credibility and his legacy, it may not be wise for Mayweather to disappoint them.

George Groves has been promised that if he remains patient he is guaranteed his world super middleweight title shot later this year.

Saint George was disappointed when the WBC suddenly granted Anthony Dirrell the right to a voluntary defence of their belt prior to meeting his mandatory challenge of Groves.

Dirrell is being allowed to fight an opponent of his choice in April but WBC President Jose Sulaiman assures Groves: 'Dirrell will then have to fight George by the autumn.'

Martin Murray truly believes he can become the first boxer to defeat the most dangerous fighter on the planet.

Gennady Golovkin, the heaviest pound-for-pound puncher in the world, says he will defend his middleweight crown by knock-out when they meet in the ring in Monte Carlo this Saturday night.

Murray, who came up only narrowly short in his two previous world title challenges to Felix Sturm in Germany and Sergio Martinez in Argentina, says: ‘I’m not afraid of him.’

In that, at the very least, we can believe him.

But it would be a monumental achievement for the impressively reformed convict from St Helens to overcome the unbeaten Kazakh.

Golovkin knocks out opponents for fun, as Anglo-Irish warrior Matthew Macklin is one of many to have discovered already.

Andy Lee, Ireland’s holder of another version of the middleweight championship, will be among those in attendance/ He is keeping a watching brief in case he overcomes the challenges of, first, Peter Quillin in America, then Hertford’s Billy Joe Saunders and goes on to face Golovkin in a unification battle.

*Golovkin-Murray will be televised live on Channel 5 on Saturday night.
