In May 1998, the town of Omagh in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland was the scene of a horrific discovery.

Under the floorboards of a half-built house, police uncovered the dismembered body of pregnant Sylvia Fleming, 17. The culprit was her boyfriend, Stephen Scott, 26.

Now, more than a decade on, her family have revealed that they're still haunted by Sylvia's violent death and are tortured by the thought that they could have done more to extract her from Scott's clutches.

Haunted: Jodie Fleming says she is haunted by her sister's terrible fate more than a decade after her murder

Speaking during an appearance on Britain's Darkest Taboos, her older sister, Josie, said: 'There's always is going to be a missing piece. We 
miss her at special occasions, like Christmas. 

'It’s a hole that you feel 
empty. And the thought of what happened that night in that flat will 
haunt me for the rest of my life.'  

Sylvia was murdered by someone who she loved and trusted - her boyfriend and the father of her unborn child, Stephen Scott.

Despite a 10-year age gap, the pair had met through friends and had a sexual relationship. Part-time fireman Scott was a known in the area as a 'jack the lad' who helped with community projects like a boxing club for teenagers. Youngsters, Sylvia among them, were said to have 'worshipped' him.

But Josie was not won over by his seemingly charismatic demeanour and disliked the way he seemed to control and belittle her sister.

She was also concerned by his penchant for hosting young teenagers at his flat, where he threw parties and bought them cigarettes and alcohol.

'He loved himself, he loved attention on him,' Josie said of why Scott hung out with younger people who idolised him rather than those his own age.

'I did not like him at all, I knew that there was something about him. I knew he had control over her.' 

Unbeknown to Josie, Scott's control over Sylvia also extended to the bedroom. Before she died, Sylvia had confided in a friend about his penchant for violent sex. On one occasion, he tried to put a pillow over her face.

Sylvia had felt uncomfortable and frightened by the experiences but the vulnerable young girl who had grown up in foster homes went along with Scott's desires in a bid to be loved.

Three months after they met, Sylvia become pregnant and Scott's true colours started to show. He didn't want to be a father and denied the baby was his.

Josie recalls how the situation unfolded: 'Sylvia had phoned me and she had told me that she had her suspicions that she was pregnant. Scott wasn’t happy. He
 didn't want to be a father, so he tried to make out Sylvia was with 
somebody else.

'It makes me feel very angry that he was trying to make 
it out like that. She
 moved out not long after she told him about the baby. She would have 
wanted things to work, but I had told her that I would always be there for her if things didn't work out with her and Scott.'

Despite moving out, Sylvia, who had just gained a job at a care home, continued to see Scott in the hope of rekindling their relationship.

But the decision to go to his house on the night of Friday, 3rd April, 1998, proved to be a fatal one.

Before Sylvia arrived, Scott had told two 14-year-old friends, who were at the flat in Lisanelly Heights that night, of his plans to murder the mother of his unborn child.

They thought it was a joke but when Sylvia arrived he took her off to his bedroom and gave her alcohol and sleeping pills, blindfolded and tied her up to the bed, taped up her eyes and mouth and then injected her with insulin.

Commenting on the case, Dr Keri Nixon, a criminal profiler who works with Cheshire Police, explains: 'If you give insulin to somebody who’s not diabetic, what it does is it lowers their blood sugar levels, and induces eventually a form of coma. 

'So he gave her alcohol, gave her valium, and gave her insulin, so she became almost like a zombie.  And he could then use her as a sexual object to carry out his sadistic sexual pleasure.'

At some point, Sylvia lost her life but police remain unsure of the exact circumstances. However, they were certain that this was not a sex game gone wrong and that Scott had intended to commit murder.

The next morning, after threatening his 14-year-old accomplices with the spectre of prison, he and the teens wrapped the body in a blanket, put it in the attic and went swimming.

'After they had done what they’d done, they went swimming in the local leisure centre, and it makes me feel physically sick to think that they were able to go on about their own business knowing what they had done that night,' adds Josie.

But events were about to catch up with Scott. Worried by Sylvia's continued absence, Josie went to Scott's flat to try and find her sister.

She recalls: 'We had our suspicions that he had hurt her. We walked in to the flat and Stephen was sitting 
on the bed and his eyes was all red, pure red. 

'I happened to glance up 
at the attic door, and he had seen me, and he moved us into the living 
room and he kept saying that he didn’t know where she was, he hadn’t 
heard from her. 

'He seemed very agitated, he kept repeating himself. I 
did have a suspicion that he had hurt her and had her up in the attic. Never did I think it went as far as it did.'

As Josie was at the police station reporting Sylvia missing, Scott set about disposing of her body.

After cutting her into eight pieces, the killer enlisted the help of a friend to help him dispose of her various body parts across the town, including at a site where new homes were being built.

But seven weeks later, Scott's attempt to cover his tracks unravelled, when his accomplice confessed his part in the crime to police and told them the whereabouts of Sylvia's head.

The gruesome discovery sent shockwaves through the town and left Josie devastated. 'When the police told me they had found part of a body they thought was her, I remember thinking "part of a body?" What the hell has happened to my sister?'

Dental records confirmed it was Sylvia. 'We were devastated,' added Josie. 'We couldn’t believe what we were being told. I’ve lost my baby sister.'

Scott and his accomplice were arrested and charged with murder and three counts of perverting the course of justice.

Jane Loughrey, a UTV news broadcaster, who reported on the case, tells of the harrowing moment when the circumstances of Sylvia's death were revealed in court.

'I've covered many trials in my time at UTV, and that's a trial that I will never forget,' she explains.

'There have been a lot of callous,
 horrendous murders in Northern Ireland, even by Northern Ireland's cruel standards, 
this was a shocking murder.' 

She added: 'The judge talked in the trial of the 
degradation and humiliation of Sylvia. Apart from the obviously
 sadistic way that she was murdered and dismembered, and callously 
placed under floorboards, it was the fact that he had no respect whatsoever [for Sylvia].  

'Sylvia was not treated like a human being; she was like a piece of 
meat, just chopped up and discarded.'

Scott showed no remorse as he was found guilty and ordered to serve a minimum 19 year sentence. His male accomplices were given two-and-a-half-years each.

Josie said she is trying to move on with their lives now the 'monster' is in jail. 'You have to remember the happy times, us always being away enjoying ourselves, laughing,' she said.

'We will always be strong, and if anything what's happened has made us even stronger. I do feel that my sisters will always be there, all though my life. He will never break our bond ever.  Ever.'
