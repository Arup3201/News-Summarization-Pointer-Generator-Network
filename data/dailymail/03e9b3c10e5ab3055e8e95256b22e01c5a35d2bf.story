Should Van Gaal keep the Class of '92 at United?

Louis van Gaal will be confirmed as Manchester United's new manager next week.

It is expected to be announced that the Dutchman is replacing David Moyes after United's final home game of the season against Hull.

Van Gaal, 62, will take over in the summer once he has finished Holland's campaign at the World Cup finals in Brazil.

It is not yet known how many of the Class of '92 will remain at Old Trafford working under Van Gaal.

Ryan Giggs is the current caretaker boss working alongside coaches Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Phil Neville.

They have taken charge at United after Moyes and the majority of his backroom team were let go last week.

Van Gaal is determined to bring his own team with him, including current Holland assistant coach Patrick Kluivert.

He may also bring in goalkeeping coach Frans Hoek, physio Jos van Dijk and video analyst Max Reckers.

He will be given massive funds to beef up United's squad this season after their failure to qualify for the Champions League.

United are confident he will have the necessary time to sign players despite his involvement with the Dutch side this summer.

Van
 Gaal will be taking his first steps into English football, although he 
has major experience with Barcelona and Bayern Munich.

PATRICK KLUIVERT - First team coach -  Age 37Legendary Dutch striker who shot to fame as a member of Van Gaal’s European Cup-winning side with Ajax in 1995, when he scored the winning goal against AC Milan in the final at the age of 18. He teamed up again with his mentor at Barcelona in 1998.

Following his retirement in 2008, Kluivert was recruited by Van Gaal to coach his strikers at AZ Alkmaar, and  then appointed as an assistant when he took charge of the Dutch national team in 2012.

FRANS HOEK - Goalkeeping coach - Age 57One of Van Gaal’s longest-serving and most trusted lieutenants, the former FC Volendam goalkeeper has worked at Ajax, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and the Dutch national team, and has overseen the development of the likes of Edwin van der Sar, Pepe Reina and Victor Valdes. Hoek has written various books on the training methods of goalkeepers.

JOS VAN DIJK - Physiotherapist - Age 57Another senior member of Van Gaal’s backroom team who has worked with him in Spain, Germany and Holland, and is trusted with full responsibility for the medical department.

MAX RECKERS - Chief analyst - Age 34The Dutchman first worked with Van Gaal at AZ Alkmaar and then followed his boss to Bayern Munich, where he spent the next two years as his chief anaylst, a role he has subsequently carried out for the Dutch national team under Van Gaal since 2012.
