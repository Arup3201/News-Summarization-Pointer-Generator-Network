Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin wants to join Tottenham ahead of neighbours Arsenal.

Arsene Wenger is a confirmed admirer of the 24-year-old France international and Arsenal have opened discussions over a proposed move to bring him to The Emirates - but Schneiderlin wants to re-join former boss Mauricio Pochettino instead.

Schneiderlin rates the Argentine highly and credits him with developing his game last season, which culminated in his selection for the World Cup.

Arsenal have interest in Real Madrid's Sami Khedira, Lars Bender of Bayer Leverkusen and William Carvalho of Sporting Lisbon but Schneiderlin was considered the easier option and arguably better value at around £16m.

Schneiderlin joined Southampton from Arsene Wenger's former club Strasbourg for just £1.2million in 2008 and has since made over 200 appearances, earning plaudits for his work-rate, high tackle count and interceptions.

He is contracted until 2017 but is ready to join the Southampton exodus once a fee is agreed.

However, rather than Arsenal it is Tottenham he is favouring as Pochettino looks to add to his first signings of Ben Davies and Michel Vorm from Swansea.
