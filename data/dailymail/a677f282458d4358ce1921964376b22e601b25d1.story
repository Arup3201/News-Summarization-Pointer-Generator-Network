Jose Riga is set to be handed a route straight back into management by Blackpool as the club edge closer to naming a new boss.

The Belgian left Charlton Athletic at the end of last season after just two months in charge and looks likely to succeed Paul Ince at Bloomfield Road with only minor details to iron out.

Riga held talks with the Seasiders over the weekend as chairman Karl Oyston nears the end of months without a permanent manager.

The 56-year-old was heralded for keeping the Addicks in the Championship during his brief spell in charge at the Valley.

Former Leeds boss Brian McDermott was also interviewed for the post, while Blackpool performed a U-turn in appointing Brian Flynn last week.

The job represents a massive task for Riga.

Under caretaker manager Barry Ferguson the North West side narrowly avoided relegation down into League One in the final weeks of last season and have only six contracted players on their books.
