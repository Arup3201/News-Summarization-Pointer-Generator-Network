Steph Harper, 34, from Flint in North Wales said she nearly died when an ectopic pregnancy ruptured hours after she was sent home from hospital

A mother claims she nearly died when an ectopic pregnancy ruptured hours after she was sent home from hospital.

Blaming delays in receiving treatment, Steph Harper said she fears the ordeal has rendered her infertile.

Surgeons were forced to remove a fallopian tube after the 34-year-old lost four pints of blood during emergency surgery at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Rhyl, North Wales.

After suffering excruciating stomach pain, the mother-of-four called an ambulance.

Within an hour a paramedic arrived at the family's home in Flint. 

With no double-manned ambulance crews available to transport Mrs Harper to hospital, the paramedic drove her in his rapid response vehicle.

There she faced delays of around an hour because of a backlog of patients waiting in ambulances to be admitted into the A&E department.

Doctors told the 34-year-old she was likely suffering an ectopic pregnancy or a urinary infection.

An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilised egg implants itself outside the wombm usually in one of the fallopian tubes. 

Mrs Harper was sent home the following morning and asked to return for a scan.

But within hours the pain had become so bad, the Mrs Harper had collapsed and could no longer speak.

She was rushed back to hospital but once again delays admitting patients into A&E meant she was left waiting in an ambulance.

When her condition deteriorated, a triage nurse assessed in her the back of the vehicle, before rushing her to the gynaecology ward where surgeons took her straight into the operating theatre.

Mrs Harper claims doctors told her she was just an hour from death when she received treatment, and warned she may never have another child.

She said: 'I began to have awful stomach pains. I called an ambulance and an hour later a paramedic car turned up at our house.

'They did the usual observations and gave me gas and air to try and ease the pain. 

'After 45 minutes the paramedic still couldn't get an ambulance so he had to take me to Glan Clwyd in the back of his car.'

Her husband Colin, 35, was with her throughout her ordeal.

He said when they arrived at the hospital, there were six ambulances queuing outside, waiting to hand over patients.

Mrs Harper was transferred to an ambulance but it was several hours before she was admitted into A&E.  

She added: 'It was a cold night but the heater had to be turned off as it was fuming out the neighbouring ambulance.

'I was very frightened as I didn't know what was happening to me – why I was in so much pain.'

After a long and uncomfortable night, Mrs Harper was booked in for a scan, given antibiotics and sent home early the following morning.

But within hours, the pain had become unbearable and Mr Harper dialled 999 again. 

He claims he was told that someone would ring him back and 20 minutes later took a call from a nurse who told Mr Harper to take her to hospital himself.

He said: 'Steph took a dozen steps towards the stairs and started to feel faint so we rushed her back to bed and phoned 999 again to get an ambulance.

'The ambulance turned up along with a rapid response vehicle 10 minutes later. 

'Three paramedics came upstairs and tried to ask Steph questions but she was in too much pain to speak.

'Steph's mother told them she needed to go back to hospital for a scan for the ectopic pregnancy but one of the paramedics was adamant she only had a water infection and told us to either take Steph ourselves or ring the GP for stronger painkillers. 

'The GP told the paramedic to take her straight to hospital.'

Mrs Harper claims she was twice forced to wait in ambulances outside Glan Clwyd Hospital in Rhyl before being seen by medics in A&E. She claims the delays are to blame for her condition becoming so severe. The hospital said it is investigating the circumstances

After arriving at A&E, the couple said they were forced to wait in the ambulance again, because there were no beds available.  

Mrs Harper's blood pressure began to drop and she quickly began to lose colour. 

A triage nurse came out to see her and had her taken immediately to the gynaecology ward where she was soon rushed into theatre.

She added: 'I am very angry as if I was diagnosed earlier it could have prevented such an extreme operation, and I wouldn't be left unable to have more children or other abdominal surgery.

'They also told me that another hour and I could have been dead. It is terrifying and these problems need to be highlighted.'

Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said in a statement: 'We have received correspondence from Mrs Harper on this matter and are investigating the concerns she has raised to establish whether the treatment provided was appropriate in relation to the symptoms that she presented with.

'We will respond to her as soon as this is completed.'

Sonia Thompson, interim head of operations for the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) area, said: 'We were very sorry to hear about Mrs Harper's experience, and take matters such as this extremely seriously.

'Although Mrs Harper has not contacted the Welsh Ambulance Service with her concerns, we will work with our colleagues at BCUHB to investigate the issues raised.'
