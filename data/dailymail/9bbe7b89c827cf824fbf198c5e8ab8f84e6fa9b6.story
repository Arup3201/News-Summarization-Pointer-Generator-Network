More than 600,000 Filipinos abandoned their homes yesterday as a powerful typhoon made landfall on the eastern coast, felling trees and knocking out power lines. 

Typhoon Hagupit – which means ‘smash’ or ‘lash’ – struck parts of the country where a typhoon left 7,300 people dead or missing in November 2013. 

Although Hagupit is not expected to match that storm’s unprecedented ferocity, the head of the Philippines’ 120,000-strong military, Gregorio Pio Catapang, said: ‘We’re on red alert, the entire armed forces are being mobilised.’

Troops have been deployed to major roads and supermarkets to prevent looting and clear debris, both of which slowed the government’s response last year, Catapang said.

Forecasters said Hagupit’s sustained winds of 109mph and gusts of 130mph were enough to set off deadly storm surges and landslides, and cause severe damage to communities and agriculture.

The storm is now heading towards the city of Tacloban, which was devastated last year. One resident, Jojo Moro, said: ‘I’m scared. I’m praying to God not to let another disaster strike us again. We haven’t recovered from the firs

More than 600,000 people moved into evacuation centres dotted around the country as the storm neared the eastern coast.

Families with young children and babies were seen taking cover in churches, town halls and sports stadiums yesterday as they prepared for Hagupit to arrive, fearing it could wreak as much havoc as Haiyan, which destroyed a million homes and displaced more than four million last November. 

Earlier in the day, social welfare secretary Corazon Soliman said: 'Over 100,000 families are already in evacuation centers. Multiply it by five (people a family), that's 500,000.'

Mayor of Manila Joseph Estrada added: 'We have alerted the people of Manila and we're ready. These typhoons change direction all the time.' 

More than 2,000 people were left stranded in the city as ports closed across the nation. Some Philippine Airlines and Cebu Pacific flights in the south of the nation were shut as the storm closed in. 

Ealy forecasts showed the typhoon was expected to travel across central Philippines, with some suggesting it could veer north towards Manila

Dr Steven Godby, expert in natural hazards at Nottingham Trent University, said: 'No other country is struck by as many tropical cyclones each year as the Philippines.

'For these storms to form, warm sea surface temperatures of at least 26C are needed and these conditions are found in the western parts of the main ocean basins, away from cold water currents.  

'Isolated island groups like the Philippines are particularly vulnerable to tropical cyclones.'

Hagupit was forecast to tear through central Philippines along the same route where Haiyan levelled villages and left more than 7,300 dead or missing.  

In Manila, President Benigno Aquino yesterday led an emergency meeting of disaster-response agencies.

The government put the military on full alert, workers opened evacuation centers and transported food packs, medicines and body bags to far-flung villages, which could be cut off by heavy rains. 

The Philippines appears to have learned lessons from last year's devastation, evacuating thousands to safer areas, including the eastern city of Tacloban, where the typhoon has triggered panic-buying in shops and petrol stations. 

Joho Moro, a 42-year-old businessman whose wife, daughter and mother were killed in Tacloban by Haiyan last year, said: 'I'm scared. I'm praying to God not to let another disaster strike us again. We haven't recovered from the first.'

He added that he had stocked up on essential supplies and water in preparation for the storm. 

Teresita Aban, a 58-year-old housewife from Santa Rita in Samar province, said: 'We're prepared but still fearful. We haven't finished repairing our house. It still has tarpaulin patches -- and here comes another storm.'

Hundreds of people still living in tents following Haiyan, known as Yolanda in the Philippines, were among the first to be relocated to safe zones in Tacloban, which has run out of hotel rooms as wealthier families booked ahead for the weekend.  

Rita Villadolid, a 39-year-old taking refuge inside a stadium, said: 'We've learned our lesson from Yolanda. Everyone here is gripped with fear.'

Disaster response official Blanche Gobenciong said nearly 12,000 residents in Tacloban, where entire settlements were wiped out by the storm, have so far been moved from high-risk villages to emergency shelters.

She said: 'We've not heard of villagers resisting to be evacuated. Their trauma is still so fresh. 

'We have a zero-casualty target. Just one loss of life will really sadden us all and make us wonder what went wrong.'

International relief teams are already positioned in the Philippines, ready for the worst.

Kevin Noone, executive director of International Medical Corps UK, which has workers on the ground prepared for the storm, said: 'Coming just one year after Typhoon Haiyan, this storm has the potential to cause widespread damage and human suffering. Our teams are on the ground and prepared for whatever the next 48 hours has in store for the people of the Philippines.'
