An Australian family who put more than half a million Christmas lights on their house have claimed a world record - for the second time.

Father-of-three David Richards from Canberra first won the title in 2011 with 331,038 lights, but was beaten by a family in New York who put up 346,283.

His family vowed to take regain the title this Christmas - so installed more than 31 miles of wire with 502,165 lights, glowing reindeer and loud music around their suburban home, to the irritation of some neighbours.

Blinding: Half a million Christmas lights have wowed and annoyed neighbours in equal measure in Canberra. Speaking about his achievement, father-of-three David Richards, who claimed a world record for the second time, said: 'I just love Christmas'

Record: The lights are attached to every possible surface - including trees, hedges, walls and the roof

Glittering: The display at the family's home took more than a month to construct and will cost £1,400 to run

The sight has attracted neighbours from miles around - although not all of them are impressed. Some have not spoken to the family since 2011.

Mr Richards, who lives in the suburb of Forrest with his wife Janean, son Aidan,
 13, and daughters Caitlin, ten, and Madelyn, six, insisted most neighbors supported 
the display.

He added: 'I have always loved 
Christmas. Having the Christmas lights with the community coming in and 
sharing it is a time when you get to know people you probably should 
know better, I guess.'

Guinness World Records today confirmed the family's charity feat has officially the most Christmas lights on a residential property.

The twinkling bulbs will cost about £1,400 to run for a month - but the sum has been donated by a local power company.

Celebration: David Richards, his wife Janean and daughter Madelyn raise a glass to celebrate his remarkable, but unusual achievement

Lit up: Scores of lights can be seen adoring the roof and nearby trees, much to the amazement of the people below

Quite the attraction! The stunt is open to the public - with scores of people already flooding to see the spectacle while many have viewed a video of the lights on YouTube

The stunt is open to the public, and hundreds of people have already visited and posted videos on Youtube. It will raise funds for children's charities including to fight Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.

Up to 70,000 people visited the light show when he last put it on in 2011 and it raised £44,000 for charity. This year Mr Richards wants to raise £56,000.

He told the Canberra Times: 'It actually helps a lot of families who have put up with an amazing amount of grief. That makes it all worthwhile to me.

'It's like a party in your driveway every night.'

Dedication: Mr Richards spent a whole month putting up the lights - which were independently verified by a Guinness World Record official

Happy times: As well as being record breakers, the lights will be used to illuminate the wedding of Mrs Richard's cousin on Saturday

The lights took a month to put up but Mr Richards did not have to count them all himself - instead delivery records and invoices were used to certify the total.

And they have had an extra use, illuminating the wedding of his wife's cousin on Saturday.

Mr Richards vowed he had retired after setting his 2011 record, but regained the taste for Christmas lights. Now he will not rule out defending himself against further challenges.

However, he said he will need a generator if he puts up any more lights.

Everybody needs good neighbours: Some nearby residents have not been on speaking terms with the Richards family since their previous record in 2011

Dazzling: The wiring for the display is 31 miles long. If there were any more lights the family would need a generator to run it
