Jeb Bush has sought to distance himself from the legacies of Bushes who previously inhabited the White House while building the case for his own presidency.

But tomorrow the 62-year-old former Florida governor will capitalize on elder brother George's relationships with the Texas business community at a fundraiser in Dallas benefiting his expected bid for the Oval Office.

George W. Bush, 68, and wife Laura will be the special guest at a fundraiser for his brother's Right to Rise political action committee on Wednesday at the home of billionaire Gerald Ford, the Dallas Morning News reports.

Tomorrow Jeb will capitalize off elder brother George's relationships with the Texas business community at a fundraiser in Dallas benefiting his expected bid for the Oval Office

Jeb Bush visits with lawmakers after speaking on the Georgia House floor last Thursday. Bush has not formally launched a presidential campaign but is taking the necessary steps to announce a bid

Attendees will pay between $5,000 per person and $100,000 a couple to rub elbows with members of the Bush dynasty, the paper says, at a roundtable, general reception, and for the top donors, a VIP session.

The 50-person guest list includes financier T. Boone Pickens, former Commerce Secretary Don Evans, who served in the George W. Bush administration, former Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and former U.S. Rep. Tom Loeffler.

The host, Gerald Ford is a banking executive and investor who is of no relation to former Republican president Gerald Ford.

As the Dallas Morning News notes, several of Jeb's new backers such as David Weekley, the founder of the largest privately held home building company in the country, and Silver Eagle Distributors head John Nau have also donated large sums to likely George W.'s successor at the Texas statehouse - Rick Perry, another likely presidential candidate.

Perry, like Bush, has not formally launched a presidential campaign but is taking the necessary steps to compete in the 2016 contest.

Texas senator Ted Cruz made his own entry into the race official on Monday during a rally at a Christian college in Virginia.

With the Dallas fundraiser on Wednesday Jeb Bush, born in Midland, Texas, will cash-grab in his opponents' backyards as he seeks to bolster his predominately establishment fan base with support from the conservative wing of the Republican Party.

Though George W. Bush left office an unpopular president, his approval ratings have ticked upward in the years since he returned to Texas.

As of last summer, he was liked nationally by roughly the same number of Americans as the current occupant of the White House, Barack Obama.

Regardless of his reputation among the American public, the 43rd President of the United States and former Texas governor has amassed a sizable donor network that will no doubt come in handy for his brother on future occasions, as well.

Last week Jeb received a helping hand in the fundraising department from his mother, former First Lady Barbara Bush, who sent a message to his PAC's donors informing them that she'd changed her mind about her son's candidacy and is now convinced that he should seek election to the highest office in the nation.

'Jeb is our best chance of taking back the White House in 2016, and I hope that you will join me in pushing him to run,' she said in the email.
