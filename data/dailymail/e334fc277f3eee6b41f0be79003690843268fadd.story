Gerard Houllier has backed the introduction of a fourth substitute for the World Cup in 2018.

A record 29 goals have been scored by players coming off the bench at this summer’s tournament in Brazil.

And former Liverpool boss Houllier said he will recommend the idea to FIFA.

Super sub: Memphis Depay came off the bench to score for Holland against Chile

Making an impact: Julian Green almost inspired the USA to an unlikely comeback against Belgium

‘I think that’s an idea that we will put to football’s rules-making panel,’ he said.

‘It’s a good idea. Only in extra time. Maybe if someone is injured, why not?

In favour: Gerard Houllier supports the introduction of a fourth sub

‘Substitutes play such an important part because they come with a freshness and attitude.

‘Nearly a quarter of (all) the goals have been scored in the final 15 minutes of the game.’

Houllier, who also coached the French national team, a member of FIFA’s technical study group.
