A Peruvian footballer says he is thinking of giving up the sport after being beaten unconscious by the same thuggish supporters of an opposing team twice in a single season.

In the latest incident Josimar Pacheco, 23, was attacked as he left the stadium after a Peruvian cup game in the District League in the city of Huaraz.

His team Sport Ancash Fe had been playing against Deportivo AMVA and were leaving the stadium when a mob of violent fans attacked them.

Disturbing images showed the young footballer's being carried from the stadium unconscious before being placed in the back of a car and rushed to hospital.

Josimar Pacheco was placed in the back of a small car and driven to a nearby hospital by his teammates

Speaking to police after the attack, Mr Pacheco said: 'I was separated from the rest of the team and remember somebody grabbing my arm and pulling me into the mob. 

'There were just blows raining down on me then, they were punching me and kicking me from every angle,' he added.

The footballer passed shortly after the attack began and was only rescued when his teammates saw what was going on and bravely intervened, freeing his limp body from beneath the attackers.

Having rescued him from the mob, Mr Pacheco's colleagues released that, frustratingly, all the first aid crews and ambulances on duty at the stadium had already left.

The footballers were left with little choice other than to place Mr Pacheco in the back of a small car and drive him to a nearby hospital themselves.

On arrival at the hospital, medics confirmed that although his beating had been severe his condition was stable. 

Mr Pacheco is expected to fully recover - although he will not be playing football for some time.

The incident has caused widespread anger in the country and police are investigating the attack as a case of attempted murder.

It later emerged that this was the second time the player ended up in hospital after an attack from football hooligans. The earlier incident happened when he was playing in a game last year, in the city of Jaen, in the northern Peruvian province of the same name.

At the time he was playing for a different team, Chavelines, and at the end of the game fans again from Deportivo ADA had stormed onto the pitch and beaten him up.
