They have not been photographed together since their 2012 divorce so it was not much of a surprise when it was reported on Wednesday that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes are not on speaking terms.

The next day TMZ added more to their story, explaining why the the 52-year-old Mission: Impossible superstar and the 36-year-old Batman Begins beauty are not fond of each other.

'Tom feels betrayed by Katie,' a source said adding that Katie felt 'he sucked the life out of her.'

Their 'bad feelings' explained: Tom Cruise felt 'betrayed' by Katie Holmes while she thought he 'drained' her, according to a Thursday report from TMZ; here they are pictured in May 2011

Katie filed for divorce from Tom Cruise in 2012 just before his 50th birthday in July.

Afterwards he hinted he was blindsided.

The mother of Suri - aged eight - quickly found her own apartment in New York City and the divorce proceedings were wrapped up in record time.

The site explained that since they posted their first article, sources called them up and added more kindling to the fire.

They were once a close family unit: Katie, 36, filed for divorce from Tom, 52,  in 2012 just before his 50th birthday in July; afterwards he hinted he was blindsided. Here they are pictured in October 2011

TMZ claimed one of those source is from the Church Of Scientology and that insider explained the Church is not involved in their feud.

'Well-placed sources with the Church tell TMZ, Katie was NOT declared a Suppressive Person. What's interesting, we're told Katie actually thinks she's been declared one ... but she hasn't,' wrote the site.

It was then explained, 'An SP stands for several things, including people who disavow the Church. The Church has a procedure for declaring people SPs. Once they're declared an SP, people in the Church are told not to associate with them.'

It was also stated clearly again that the two stars 'are not at war over the Church Of Scientology' and that they don't talk because 'they have an intense dislike for one another.'

Earlier it was reported that Tom and Katie don't even talk about Suri. Rather they leave that up to intermediaries.

'They want nothing to do with each other to the point they don't speak to one another, even about Suri,' a source told the site.

Their only child: 'They want nothing to do with each other to the point they don't speak to one another, even about Suri,' a source told the site; here Suri, aged eight, is pictured with Suri in June 2012

Even planning visitations and discussing how the little girl should be raised is done through others, it was alleged.

'There is no desire on either Tom's or Katie's part to mend fences,' it was added.

It was claimed that Tom has not seen Suri 'in months' because he has been shooting Mission: Impossible 5 in London.

They had the wedding of the year: Katie became Mrs Tom Cruise in Italy in November 2006

But his team has insisted many times since his 2012 divorce from Holmes that the Top Gun star does make time for his child and sees her often.

Reps for Cruise have not returned calls to Daily Mail.

TMZ insisted that Katie is upset the Oblivion actor doesn't see their child more.

The site added he has wrapped his film and will be back in LA soon, where Katie and Suri now reside.

Katie is raising their daughter in the same Calabasas neighborhood where Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian live. The former Dawson's Creek star is in LA to film her arc on TV's Ray Donovan. 

Holmes does not seem too concerned about these reports. Very early on Wednesday morning she posted to Instagram a video of herself in dance class with a male instructor.

Her caption read, 'Kicking into Wednesday! Have a great day!'

In early March the Miss Meadows star shared the quote from Nelson Mandela, 'May your choices reflect your hopes not your fears.'
