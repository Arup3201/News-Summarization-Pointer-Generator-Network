It may have been an unlikely dream, but scientists have finally put paid to hopes of resurrecting dinosaurs from DNA.

A study of fossils found in New Zealand found that DNA has a half life of 521 years - meaning half the bonds between cells are broken after this time.

'This confirms the widely held suspicion that claims of DNA from 
dinosaurs and ancient insects trapped in amber are incorrect,' Simon Ho, a computational evolutionary biologist at the University of 
Sydney in Australia told Nature.com.

The research means that it would be impossible for the plot of Jurassic Park, which saw dinosaurs brought back to life using DNA recovered from amber, to come true.

Palaeogeneticists led by Morten Allentoft at the University of 
Copenhagen and Michael Bunce at Murdoch University in Perth, Australia, 
examined 158 DNA-containing leg bones belonging to three species of 
extinct giant birds called moa.

The bones, which were between 600 and 8,000 years old, had been 
recovered from three sites within 5 kilometres of each other, with 
nearly identical preservation conditions including a temperature of 13.1
ºC.

By comparing the specimens' ages and degrees of DNA degradation, the 
researchers calculated that DNA has a half-life of 521 years - ruling out the dreams of bringing dinosaurs back to life.

The findings are published today in Proceedings of the Royal Society B1.

The team predicts that even in a bone at an ideal preservation temperature of −5 ºC, effectively every bond would be destroyed after a maximum of 6.8 million years.

The DNA would cease to be readable much earlier — perhaps after roughly 1.5 million years, when the remaining strands would be too short to give meaningful information.

However, some researchers have raised the question of whether fossils trapped in permafrost.

'I am very interested to see if these findings can be reproduced in very different environments such as permafrost and caves,' Michael Knapp, a palaeogeneticist at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, told Nature.

Researchers also admit several other factors could help preserve DNA.

Alan Cooper, director of the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA at the University of Adelaide, South Australia, said: 'The rotting process after death is very seasonal and context dependent, and has a major impact on DNA survival.'

Last week the Moscow News reports a male mammoth which died about 30,000 years ago at the age of 15 had been found frozen in permafrost - and hope to find DNA.

The boy who made the astonishing discovery has been named as Yevgeny Salinder, ABC News reported.

He found the frozen beast in Taymyr, north Russia, where he lives with his family, close to the Sopkarga polar station.

Woolly mammoths have been found in the permafrost in Siberia since at least 1929, but this is one of the best preserved, researchers believe.

Its tusks, mouth and rib cage are clearly visible.

After telling his parents about his incredible find, scientists were able to confirm the discovery.

It is believed to be the second best preserved mammoth ever unearthed and the best mammoth discovery since 1901.

It has now been named Zhenya after the boy's nickname and will be studied by scientists.

Alexei
Tikhonov, a mammoth specialist with the Russian Academy of Sciences, 
told journalists that the last time such a well-preserved mammoth was 
found in Russia was in 1901, also in the Krasnoyarsk region, but much 
farther south, according to the statement.

The
carcass will become an exhibit at the Taimir Regional Studies Museum, 
but museum staff have agreed to allow scientists from zoological and 
paleontological institutes in Moscow and St. Petersburg study it first.
