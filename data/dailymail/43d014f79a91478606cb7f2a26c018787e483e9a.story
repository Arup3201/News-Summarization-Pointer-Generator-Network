Those hoping for Spring weather and sunshine tomorrow will be sorely disappointed, as rain, sleet and snow are arriving just in time for the weekend.

Snow and sub-zero temperatures are on the way as many parts of the UK brace themselves for a cold snap over the weekend.

The highlands of north Scotland could see up to 20cm of snow, while the east of England is expected to endure heavy rain - particularly in Essex and East Anglia.

There are four weather warnings across England today, as forecasters predict temperatures could plummet to -5C on Sunday night, with the country waking up to chilly readings of 1C on Monday.

Met Office forecaster Charlie Powell said: 'There is going to be quite a dramatic difference from the double figures the country has been experiencing this week.

'It will be a marked change in temperature from at least Sunday.

'Expect some disruption in the next few days.'

The outlook promises miserable weather for the weekend, with bitter winds and cloud sweeping the country

Forecasters have warned that a band 
of rain, sleet and snow is sweeping southwards, with strong, freezing 
winds making the temperatures feel even colder than they are.

A band of rain will sweep south from Scotland, into the northern midlands, affecting the Pennines and Derbyshire.

Strong easterly winds will hit the east coast, making low temperatures feel even chillier.

By Monday, winds coming in south-westerly direction from across the Channel will mingle with the low temperature and low pressure, making it bitterly cold across the south coast.

While not record-breaking lows for March, temperatures are below average, with no sign of a respite in the near future, according to Tony Conlan of MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association.

While the weekend would see snow showers for many places, the coldest weather was going to arrive early next week

'Saturday is going to be a transition day,' he said.

'Rain and sleet will affect many areas, turning into snow on northern hills.'

It will be a mixed day for different parts of the UK however, with temperatures across most regions being between 3C and 6C, but getting to as high as 15C in parts of south west England, with Torquay likely to be the warmest place.

Over the weekend, wind speeds will increase, going up to as high as 30mph in Devon.

Mr Conlan said: 'There will be snow showers on Saturday night, particularly over north-east England and east Scotland.

Strawberry growers have a new hi-tech weapon to help guard fruit against the unpredictable British weather

The first English strawberries of the year have been picked today as growers aim to set a new annual record of 65,000 tonnes.

Unlike previous years, strawberry growers have a new hi-tech weapon to help guard fruit against the unpredictable British weather.

The state-of-the-art computer-aided forecasting system allows growers to predict volume down to individual fields.

'What people will notice then is the strength of the cold, north-easterly wind, which is going to really pick up.

'It will be bitterly cold in the wind and temperatures will mostly stay below zero as we head into Sunday.

'Sunday will be a day of sunshine and a scattering of snow showers. Much of the UK will see snow, but Scotland and the North East will again see the most snow.'

He said that while the weekend would see snow showers for many places, the coldest weather was going to arrive early next week. On Monday, temperatures are unlikely to be above zero anywhere in the country.

'There are no signs of spring anywhere on the horizon,' added Mr Conlan.
