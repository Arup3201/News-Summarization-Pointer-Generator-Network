There can't be many things more out of step with a wet, miserable February than the explosion of heat, humidity and spectacular colour you'll find in an orchid house.

But as these stunning images show, spending time among these exotic flowers might be the perfect antidote to the cold and rainy weather outside.

The images were taken at the Princess of Wales Conservatory at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew as part of a new exhibition titled 'Orchids: A Plant Hunter's Paradise', which is set to run until March.

Rare: Horticulturalist Jess Lee admires the Phalaenopsis hybrid 'Diamond Sky' at the 'Orchids' exhibition

Stunning: The 'Orchids' exhibition runs from February 8, 2014 until March 9  and features over 6,500 hybrid orchids which have taken a team of 20 horticulturalists four weeks to build

As part of the exhibition, visitors will be transported into a tropical rainforest full of horticultural displays of intense exotic colour, sounds and scents.

Visitors are encouraged to explore a 
hidden world of orchids and tropical plants as they are taken on a 
journey through time, retracing the footsteps of the intrepid Victorian 
plant-hunters, right through to their modern-day counterparts at Kew 
Gardens.

Orchids are some of the most valuable 
plants in the world, hunted by botanists for centuries and long desired, 
collected and admired for their beauty, rarity, and symbolism.

Opening tomorrow, the display at Kew Gardens will include a cascade of Vanda orchids, drapes of tropical flowers, and a replica plant-hunterâ€™s camp in the pond area, dotted with wardian cases and floating canoes bulging with plants destined for distant lands, echoing Kewâ€™s history in this area.

A team of scientists will also be on hand every 
Wednesday and Sunday until the exhibition closes on March 9 to give visitors an insight into how certain 
species have been brought back from the brink of extinction using 
micro-propagation techniques.

Phil Griffiths, Kewâ€™s Glasshouse Displays Coordinator says: 'The orchids have to be ordered and planted at just the right moment for just the right amount of time to catch them at their peak.

'The intensity of their colours, as well as the speed of their life-cycle, will depend on the level of light the glasshouse gets in February, and obviously this varies year-on-year,' he added.

Mr Griffiths went on to say: 'Our challenge is to keep the glasshouse looking magical for a month and while we humans may not like the cold, controversially, the best weather for the plants longevity is crisp and dull with no sun.'
