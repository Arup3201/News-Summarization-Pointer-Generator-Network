Line of fire: Fox sports reporter Erin Andrews took the brunt of a joke aimed at the Red Sox player, Jarrod Saltalamacchia, she was interviewing

Catcher Saltalamacchia got off quite lightly after his team mate threw Gatorade over them, Ms Andrews however, got soaked

As he was explaining how he managed to pull off the big hit, his team mate, Number 18, sneaked up behind them and threw a large bucket of orange sports drink over the pair.

Sadly for Ms Andrews, however, she caught the brunt of the sticky joke, soaking her hair and jacket.

Acting like a pro, however, the reporter continued her interview, unphased.

After the prank, the blonde reporter who had travelled from Los Angeles to cover the match, posted a photo of herself on Twitter.

With soaked hair and sticking her tongue out, she Tweeted: 'Gotta love postseason baseball #Gatorade'

The Boston Red Sox beat the Detroit Tigers 6-5 at Fenway Park, Boston, in Sunday night's Game 2 of the American League baseball championship series.

Good humour: The Fox News reporter saw the funny side of the joke and tweeted this picture of herself after the prank

Ms Andrews had been asking the Red Sox catcher about his first walk-off hit in postseason.

'You mentioned being resilient - what took so long to finally get some hits?' she asked.

'At the moment, as long as it takes to get the win,' he replied.

'This city has been so resilient all year long and that's how we play the game.'

His Red Sox team mate is then seen running up behind the film crew carrying a large container. Then the two get soaked, live on TV.

'Hey,' shouts Ms Andrews, but she keeps her cool and continues the interview.

'And this is the first time since Carlton Fisk the catcher has had a walk-off,' she continues, before adding: 'How are you feeling?' I'm drenched.'

'Yeah, feels great,' he says.
