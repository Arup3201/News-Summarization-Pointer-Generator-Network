The Centro de Treinamento Alfredo Gottardi is large, sprawling and, in places, a little down at heel.

The football pitches are well tended and the hotel is in reasonable condition. But there is a sense of fading grandeur at Atlético Paranaense, partly enhanced by the dripping, dank atmosphere of the Curitiba winter.

All around the vast training complex there is poverty, decay, people without work sitting on their doorsteps drinking from litre bottles of beer and the only things for sale are tractors, new tyres, fresh oil and a revamped exhaust if you want it.

Shock: The world champions are out of the 2014 World Cup after two consecutive defeats

Won't need these again: Iker Casillas throws his gloves to fans after a poor display at the Maracana

Head bowed: Vicente Del Bosque got major decisions wrong throughout a dismal campaign for Spain

You can easily imagine that, when they were first opened, these grounds where Spain have been living and training must have been a shiny, glittering monument to football. These days, they’ve been overtaken by the kind of first-class facilities encountered at the majority of top European football clubs.

All in all, Spain’s chosen home here in Brazil has been a decent metaphor for their World Cup  performance: Down at heel, lacking in warmth, no longer cutting edge.

And there are other things, beyond the football, which separate Spain’s campaign in Brazil from the  victories in Switerland-Austria in 2008, South Africa in 2010 and Poland-Ukraine two years ago.

There have been a myriad of small fissures which have combined to make a genuine San Andreas fault right down the middle of the world champions’ brand of play.

First to the intangibles. This is the first major tournament since Spain started winning where the players’ daily life is not complemented with time off to spend with wives, girlfriends, kids, grandparents.

Brazil is an odd place. The army is everywhere; patrolling the streets, guarding the training ground, swarming all over every stadium.

Between crime and social protest, Spain’s players have been stripped of the natural outlet of wandering around their local area.

This is also the first tournament since the breakthrough where Spain have done no double sessions.

Treated as a way to hone fitness and match sharpness, plus a specific attack on the kind of boredom and loneliness which can suck the vitality out of any squad, I think it has been an error to decide that — because the players are brutally tired after six or seven years of constant top-level challenges and success — this was the time to drop the second sessions.

Then there’s the climate. Winter in Curitiba is no worse than an inhospitable Scottish autumn, but the weather has been grey, damp and grisly cold.

Horror: Casillas has been a walking mistake this tournament and was consoled by Sergio Ramos against Chile

Awful: Brazilian-born Diego Costa has been a huge disappointment for Spain in the first two games

For Spaniards, it has been a bane. More so when the first game in Salvador was preceded by a hot, humid training day and the build-up weather in Rio was in the mid 80s. Neither match was difficult in terms of the heat or humidity but both environments were a huge change from the chill of the south.

But back in 2008 the mud and the rain of Stubaital, where Spain trained, were a much more stark contrast with the sweltering heat of the three knockout matches in Vienna en route to the title.

Temperatures at night in Potchefstroom often hit zero or less and Spain coped. What has changed? Appetite? Youth? Squad harmony?

Something I can tell you as a first-hand witness is that what Vicente del Bosque said on Friday — that there has been no correlation between how the world champions train and how they play — is true.We’ve been permitted to watch all but two of the training sessions here and Spain have moved the ball with dazzling speed and confidence.

The work was serious, the players motivated.You could hear the voices of Sergio Ramos, Pepe Reina and del Bosque urging more from those involved.

Trouble: Fernando Torres looked more threatening than Costa despite struggling for form in recent years

Is that a captain's stance? Casillas looked bemused in the tunnel before going out for the second half

Out on their feet: The Spanish team looked tired in the second half, and were outrun against Chile

What you all watched on television — stumbling, imprecise, languid, unrecognisable shadows — did not resemble the guys we had watched.

Something which now seems completely clear is that this group has been knocked dizzy by three firm blows to the chin. Firstly, Spain have moved in the food chain from predators to prey.

For years teams were petrified of them. Teams parked the bus because they knew that hitting Spain on the counter was probably the least risky way of doing them damage.

Gradually, France in the qualifying group, Italy in the Confederations Cup semi-final and Brazil in the  subsequent final have shown that, if you go after Spain, then athleticism, height and power can leave the world champions vulnerable.

Secondly — the fact that Xavi, at 34, is a declining force has been of cataclysmic importance.

As for those who say it was wrong of del Bosque to bring him, there was little of that talk when he  produced the brilliant pass from which Diego Costa won the penalty in the opening match. It’s also worth pointing out that when Xavi was dropped for the Chile match, Spain’s midfield, if anything, deteriorated.

Glum: Xavi (centre) could only watch on as his Spain side were utterly humiliated at the Maracana

They can't believe it! Spanish supporters watched on distraught as they were taught a footballing lesson

What has unarguably gone is Xavi’s ability to control the ebb and flow of an entire match with his elegant pass-move-pass-move.

With decline, Spain’s confidence that they can dominate possession in an attacking, front-foot manner has gradually drained away.

His play, his leadership has defined this era. I see team-mates no longer sure that they can shunt the ball to Xavi and something safe, intelligent and probably dangerous to the opponent will be done.

For Spain to cope with the change in other teams’ attitude to them plus Xavi’s inevitable lessening of  influence has been too much.

Thirdly, the lack of goals is a fatal flaw. Every team needs a pressure release and I’ll leave here bamboozled as to why del Bosque thought that he saw goals in Costa.

The Brazilian got here fit — but out of form. That never changed in training or in the match. His role should have been that of impact sub.

Missing: David Villa (right) failed to play against Holland or Chile despite being in better form than Costa

New blood: Atletico Madrid midfielder Koke (right) will be a major part of the new-look Spain

David Villa, on the other hand, scored twice in the last friendly and regularly in training. But got no minutes in the first two games.

Xabi Alonso pointed out that Spain made ‘too many errors’. He could have had his captain, Iker Casillas, in mind. This tournament asked him to stretch his resources just too far. By the end of the Champions League Final in Lisbon he was spent.

But those who insist that this is the end for a philosophy of football are wrong. It is an undignified end for some all-time great players but, above all, Spain arrived here two weeks behind their opposition in terms of match sharpness.

That will change. Pedro, Jordi Alba, Ramos, Gerard Pique, Koke, David de Gea, Sergio Busquets, David Silva and Andres Iniesta will stay. Thiago, Isco, Dani Carvajal, Jese, Alberto Moreno and Ander Herrera, all of whom have won European Under-21 titles, will join them.

Renewal will take place and Spain winning Euro 2016 is a decent bet. Right now, that’s little consolation for a desolate World Cup.

Faded grandeur.
