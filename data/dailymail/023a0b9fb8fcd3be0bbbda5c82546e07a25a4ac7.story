An interview on BBC Radio 5 Live ended in dramatic fashion - when a reporter was forced to hang up her phone as an earthquake struck.

Belinda McCammon had been talking to presenter Dotun Adebayo live from Christchurch about this morning's first quake when she was drowned out by a loud rattling noise.

Audibly panicked, she said: 'Oh I'm sorry, we're just having a major earthquake, I've got to go, I've got to go, I've got to go.'

The Radio New Zealand journalist then cut out leaving Adebayo, presenter of the Up All Night show, saying: 'OK, you go, you get yourself to safety.'

Perhaps out of frustration that he had lost a guest, he then mumbled 'Oh for good...' before re-gaining composure.

He continued: 'Well, as you heard there our reporter Belinda McCammon in the middle of another shake.

'I'm not sure if that was an aftershock or it was an actual shake. We will try and get hold of her later on and bring you news of her situation.'

McCammon has since tweeted from her personal account, indicating she was not injured in the quake.

People fled into the streets and flights were diverted
when today's quake, and its subsequent four aftershocks, hit with 
buildings swaying in the city and at the airport shortly before 
lunchtime.

The first 5.8-magnitude quake struck on 
Friday afternoon. Minutes later, a 
5.3-magnitude aftershock hit.

It was not immediately known if 
anyone had died - but one person was injured at a city mall, four people were rescued after being
trapped by a rock fall and 60 were treated for minor injuries.

There were no immediate reports of widespread damage and a tsunami alert
was not issued.

Today's quake comes just 10 months after
February's magnitude-6.3 - in almost the same spot - killed 182 people 
and crippled large areas. In September 2010 the area was hit by a 
magnitude-7.1.
