Monsoon floods have now hit more than a million people in Kashmir and left 450 dead as authorities plan drastic measures to stop more deaths.

Days of heavy rain have lashed the mountains and valleys on the border of India and Pakistan, flooding whole towns and causing landslides which have devastated people's homes.

Today the waters began to recede as more than 300,000 people were left stranded in Indian Kashmir alone - but authorities warned there could be more flooding to come.

Deluge: Tens of thousands of homes have been destroyed by flash floods and landslides which have hit more than a million people on the border of India and Pakistan

Hospitals are struggling to cope with the scale of the disaster, which has affected more than a million people.

The flash floods have washed away tens of thousands of people and crops for many thousands more in the key farming region in just one week. 

Phone lines, power and water supplies in the northern Indian region have been down for days and authorities say food and water supplies are running low.

Earlier today officials said the death toll in India and Pakistan combined had reached 461 as Pakistani troops used helicopters and boats to evacuate thousands of marooned people, while India's military dropped food for hundreds of thousands.

On Pakistan's side of the border, the floodwaters were threatening huge tracts of farmland in Punjab province and millions of people in the cities of Muzaffargarh and Multan, the heart of Pakistan's cotton industry.

Pakistan's army planted explosives today which would be used to blow up three strategic dykes to divert waters away from the cities.

Spread: Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian Kashmir, has been submerged by the floodwaters. Reports have emerged of angry victims attacking emergency workers

Response: Troops have been deployed and government officials gave up a day's salary for the relief effort in solidarity, but that has not stemmed the tide of anger

Devastated: Srinagar in Indian Kashmir is famous for its mountain views, but around 200 people there have now been killed by flash floods after monsoon rain

Scale: An aerial view shows the spread of the floodwaters. In the most serious floods to hit the region in 2010, an area the size of England was left underwater

Help: Kashmiri Muslims treading carefully today across the remains of a wall on the banks of the River Jehlum in Srinagar. More than 450 people have died in total

Natural beauty: The Dal Lake in Srinagar. Over the border in Pakistan, authorities were considering blowing up strategic dykes to divert the ceaseless flow of water

A senior Multan government official told AFP the dykes were likely to be blown in the evening, but the blast could be put off if the waters recede. 

Similar drastic measures were taken yesterday to protect the city of Jhang, further upstream, where 10,000 people were evacuated overnight.

All schools in the Multan area are expected to be closed for the next two days after troops  rescued 22,000 people stranded by floodwaters so far in Pakistan.

Of the 461 dead, 261 were believed to have been in Pakistan while 200 were in India - but the toll is expected to rise.

Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said seven more people had died as Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif pledged compensation worth £6,000 to families who had lost their loved ones.

In India, reports have emerged of victims attacking emergency workers in their anger at the slow pace of the rescue effort.

Rescue: Officials said the slow reaction to the disaster happened partly because the speed of the rising waters took them by surprise and flooded government buildings

Desperate: Phone lines to Srinagar (pictured) have been cut off for days and supplies of food and water are running out as hundreds of thousands remain stranded

Rescue: Thousands of people have also been affected in Pakistan's Punjab province (pictured), where more than 250 people have died and cities are threatened

Refugees: Despite displacing thousands of people including this family seeking sanctuary at a Srinagar mosque, the floods are not as devastating as those in 2010

Higher ground: Many Muslims living in Indian Kashmir have taken to the foothills of the Himalayas to shelter from the flash floods, leaving their damaged homes behind

Police have been gathering floating bodies including those of a news photographer in Srinagar, a city famous for its lake and mountain views.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered a 'massive effort to ensure basic hygiene and sanitation in the water-logged areas of Srinagar' amid fears of a disease outbreak. 

Indian Kashmir's chief minister Omar Abdullah said  waters had risen so quickly that the entire government machinery was  swamped - literally.

'My secretariat was under water, my police headquarters was under water, my control room was under water, my fire services was under water, two of my key hospitals were under water and there was no cell phone communication', he told a news channel.

One doctor at the Ahmed hospital in Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian Kashmir, added: 'There is no electricity. The hospital is entirely working on two gensets (portable generators), on alternate basis.

Holiday cut short: Tourists were rescued from flooded areas of Srinagar and put on an Indian air force helicopter today as thousands more remained stranded

Over the border: In Punjab province, Pakistan, the flooding was just as severe. Each nation has pledged to help the other recover despite wars over Kashmir in the past

Vast: Panchari village (pictured) was one of the worst hit by landslips, which destroyed homes and left rescue workers picking through enormous pieces of rubble

'Nothing is coming from anywhere... we had to hijack water, there is no water here. We cut bedsheets in two and sterilised them for use in surgery.'

The Indian army has deployed about 30,000 troops for rescue
and relief operations and soldiers distributed 224,000 litres of
water and food to survivors. 

In a gesture of solidarity, staff
at the  prime minister's office gave up one day's salary
for flood relief.

Many people praised the army on social media for its efforts
but others vented their anger at delays in getting help to
survivors.

Basharat Peer, a journalist and author of a book on the
Kashmir conflict, who is working as a volunteer in Srinagar,
said the response to the disaster had been woeful.

'It is clear case of mismanagement,' he said. 'Why are the basic
supplies still not made available?

Saved: Pakistani Army soldiers evacuate flood victims through helicopters in Jhang, Punjab province. The waters could spread downriver to affect 5 million people

Marooned: This house with farm animals in Jhang, Pakistan, was  just high up enough to avoid the floods, whose waters began to recede in some regions today

Contrast: The red-brown structures of another complex in Jhang were stark against the lush green landscape and the the muddy waters surrounding them

Farming haven: The plains near the foothills of the Himalayas including Pakistan's Punjab province, pictured, are normally rich in soil but crops have washed away

Dirty: Officials fear the sudden deluge will spread water-borne diseases such as diaorrhea if urgent sanitation measures are not put in place soon

Refugees: Thousands of Indians and tourists gathered yesterday at Srinagar Airport in Indian Kashmir as they waited to be rescued from the sudden floods

Relief: One flood victim clutched a bunch of bananas as volunteers distributes aid in Srinagar. The floods have washed away crops and roads, leaving  supplies scarce

Ruined: Homes in Srinagar have been sliced apart by the waters and the landslides which followed, killing hundreds of people. The survivors will face a bill of millions

British MPs warned today that entering the Kashmir dispute would 'smack of neo-imperialism' and appear arrogant.

The warning was issued by Tory Greg Barker who said intervention between India and Pakistan would be 'slightly offensive'.

Nick Clegg told the Times of India last month that Britain does not want to be a mediator, but other Lib Dems have disagreed.

Lib Dem MP David Ward told the Commons: 'There is - and we cannot escape it - a British legacy here and I think we have a responsibility.' 

'There are thousands of people searching for their families
They have no idea whether they are alive or dead. We have no
clean drinking water, no medicines and food to feed the
children.'

An ancient region in the heart of the Himalayas, Kashmir as it is commonly known is divided between India and Pakistan - but the region is claimed by both countries.

Two of the three wars the nations have fought since their independence from Britain in 1947 have been over control of the mountainous zone.

However, relations  improved slightly in recent years and each side has offered to help the other recover from the floods. 

The floods have been happening annually in Pakistan and were at their worst in recent memory in 2010, when 1,800 people died and 20 million were affected.

In those floods 62,000 square miles of land were swamped - an area bigger than England.

The deluge  cost the Pakistan £6billion, a fifteenth of its total annual output.

Analysts said this year's floods do not appear to be on the same scale as in 2010 but could match those in 2012, which killed almost 600 people and affected almost 5 million.

Any means necessary: Residents of the summer capital Srinagar rode to relative safety on the back of a tractor, one of the few vehicles which could brave the flood

Patient: The only way to get around Srinagar safely is now by boat, but few are available and residents have had to wait in the upper floors of their homes

Rubble: Survivors in Indian Kashmir's winter capital Jammu were dwarfed by their damaged houses today as authorities vowed to speed up the rescue effort

Nothing left: The disaster has flattened thousands of homes and forced their residents to flee the area. As the waters recede, the repair bill will mount higher
