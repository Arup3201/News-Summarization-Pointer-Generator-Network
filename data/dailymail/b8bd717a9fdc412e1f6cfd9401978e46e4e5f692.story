Jack Wilshere has revealed that the Arsenal squad want to win the Champions League as a ‘thank you’ to manager Arsene Wenger, who has yet to win Europe’s biggest club prize in his 31-year managerial career.

Wenger reached the Champions League semi-final with Monaco in 1994 and the 2006 final, when 10-man Arsenal led Barcelona 1-0 after having Jens Lehmann sent off, before conceding two late goals to lose 2-1.

Despite qualifying for the tournament a record 17 consecutive years in a row with Arsenal, Wenger has never won it. Instead he has watched his great rivals Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho pick up the trophy twice, while Roberto Di Matteo won the trophy with Chelsea at his first attempt in 2012 and Pep Guardiola won it twice within three years of taking up management.

And Wilshere says that the Arsenal team want to set the record straight for Wenger. ‘For him, that would be the icing on the cake if you like,’ said Wilshere. 

‘He has been 17 years and had one final — he came close to winning that, he was unlucky, he had Lehmann sent off — so I think this is the one he really, really wants, as well as the Premier League, because he wants it for us. But if he gives the Champions League to us it will also be like a present [from us] to him if we win the Champions League.’

Arsenal start their campaign at 2013 finalists Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday, a fixture which has become familiar in recent years, with the teams being drawn together in 2011 and 2013, with Arsenal recording an impressive 1-0 win in Dortmund but losing a 2-1 at The Emirates, a result which cost them top spot in the group.

Wilshere said: ‘Between us two, they are always good games and they will be thinking the same. They won’t want to be coming to us again even though they won here last year, we won there. It is a tough game and we go there first and it’s almost like the England game against Switzerland if you like; the hardest game in the group will be the first one and we can almost put a marker down in that game by saying we’re here to win this group.

‘I think that’s the target at the start. We always said that. Over the last few seasons we almost thought we were finishing top and we lost the last game and it has cost us.

‘We have really been unlucky with the draw over the last few years, with Bayern Munich twice, they’re the best team in Europe for me, so we could have had anyone else and had a little bit more of a chance of going through, but, as you said, it is really important to finish top of the group.’
