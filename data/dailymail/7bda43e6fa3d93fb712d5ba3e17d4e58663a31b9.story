British anti-terror chiefs have warned that a large-scale terror attack on the Winter Games in Sochi is 'very likely to occur'.

A threat assessment by Whitehall officials names a Caucasus group, Imarat Kavkaz (IK), as top of the watch-list since it has repeatedly made threats against the Games in recent months.

The assessment points out that in July 2013 the IK's fugitive leader, Emir Doku Umarov, called on his followers to do what they can to disrupt the Games.

But with the Winter Olympics scheduled to begin next month, the report questions whether the group's ability to plan and carry out an attack in such a short time frame.

High alert: Russian Cossacks stand guard near the Rosa Khutor Alpine Resort in Krasnaya Polyana near Sochi. British intelligence chiefs say the 37,000 extra soldiers and police that have been drafted in to boost security have formed a 'ring of steel' around the event

A twin bomb attack on the city of Volgograd in December killed 34 people before a militant Islamist group, based in Dagestan claimed responsibility.But British intelligence says the 37,000 extra soldiers and police that have been drafted in to boost security have formed a 'ring of steel' around the event, making it a much harder target.

The authorities have also been hunting a suspected would-be suicide bomber named as Ruzanna Ibragimova, the 22-year old widow of a militant.

Authorities fear she, as well as up to three other female suicide bombers known as black widows, lying low in Sochi ahead of a planned attack on the Games.

Wanted: Ruzan Ibragimov, whose husband was an Islamist militant killed by Russian security forces last year

Changeable: Islamists in Caucasus are notorious for their use of 'black widows' as they can use make-up to change their appearance and usually go unsuspected. Ibramigova, pictured, is described as having a limp and a scar

She is described as having a limp, a scar on her cheek, and that her left arm does not bend at the elbow.

The posters say that Russian authorities believe she left Dagestan, a Russian republic in the Caucasus, earlier this month, and may be headed for the Olympic city.

The hunt follows the release of a video showing two young men who are believed to have been bombers in the December 2013 Volgograd attacks.

Russian president Vladimir Putin, seen in this file photo, told ABC that Russia will do 'whatever it takes' to make the Sochi Games secure. An expected 80,000 troops are to be on guard

Posted by group Ansar al Sunah on a militant Chechen site, the two men warned that as long as President Vladimir Putin occupies the North Caucasus region near Sochi, Russians and Olympic visitors alike will not be safe, ABC News reported.

'We'll have a surprise package for you,' one of the men said in the video, according to the ABC report. 'And those tourists that will come to you, for them, too, we have a surprise. If it happens [the Olympics], we'll have a surprise for you.

The FCO advises against all travel to Chechnya, Ingushetia and Dagestan and the districts of Budyonnovsky, Levokumsky, Neftekumsky, Stepnovsky and Kursky in Stavropol Krai.
