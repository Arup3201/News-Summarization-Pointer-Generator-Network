The mother of a murdered teenager has spoken of her agony after sick internet trolls posted abuse on a website dedicated to her daughter's memory.

Charlotte Downes, 14, vanished in 2003 after being groomed by a child sex gang in Blackpool, and her body has never been found.

Police believe that she was murdered, and it has been claimed her body was chopped up for kebab meat.

The teenager's mother Karen, 48, has revealed how a page on an internet site dedicated to Charlene has been bombarded with sickening messages.

They include claims that Mrs Downes and her husband Rob, 52, were partly responsible for their daughter’s death.

'There are a lot of evil people, saddos and weirdos on Facebook making up all kinds of filth,' said Mrs Downes.

'It is all hearsay and lies. I’ve had people threatening to come round to my house and beat me up.

'I informed the police.

'It is bad enough Charlene is not around without people making up this disgusting stuff.

'They won’t come and say it to your face, so they say it over the internet and I just want it to stop. Charlene will never be forgotten, but we need closure.'

Mrs Downes said messages were left on the social networking site accusing her and her husband of allowing Charlene to be abused, claims they have always denied.

It is the first time she has spoken out since cold-case detectives from Lancashire police re-opened the case in November, 10 years after Charlene disappeared.

At the time she vanished, the teenager was believed to have been one of a group of girls being groomed for sex with cash, gifts and booze.Detectives said Charlene may have been abused by up to 100 men.

In 2007, two Blackpool takeaway shop owners were charged with Charlene’s murder.

Prosecutors claimed, based on secret recordings, that her body was chopped into bits and used for kebabs.

However, the first jury failed to reach a verdict.

A retrial was scrapped and the men cleared because witnesses and the police’s recorded evidence were 'unreliable'.

The defendants, business partners Iyad Albattikhi and Mohammed Reveshi, later received six-figure compensation payouts for false imprisonment.

Mrs Downes had hoped to launch a civil prosecution against them, but said she could not afford to hire lawyers to help her.

'The cost of a solicitor will be about £6,000 to start with,' she said.

'I haven’t got that kind of money. I’m upset and devastated, but what can I say. I’ve just got to live with it.'

She also hit out at the police, saying the family has had little support, a claim they have denied.

'Since the case collapsed in 2008, all the police have done is fobbed me off and gone through the same things over and over again,' said Mrs Downes.

'They said the case had been re-opened in November but then they said it has never been closed.

'It can’t be both.

'I’m so mad. I do not have any faith in the police at all.

'I just hope and pray the police help us but they just don’t seem to want to know.'

A spokesman for Lancashire Police said cold-case detectives met the Downes family on February 18 and said a family liaison officer had been in contact as recently as last week.

She said: 'We are not discussing any new lines of inquiry at this stage.'
