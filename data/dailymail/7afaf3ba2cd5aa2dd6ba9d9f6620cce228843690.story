Celebrity chef Ross Burden who rose to fame after appearing on MasterChef and Ready Steady Cook has died aged 45.

The TV cook, who became a household name in the UK after becoming a finalist on MasterChef in 1993, died on July 17 in his home nation following a battle with cancer.

The New Zealand-born popular chef was diagnosed with a form of leukemia in July last year and had contracted an infection after undergoing a bone marrow transplant recently.

Passed away: Celebrity chef Ross Burden, who rose to fame in the UK after starring on MasterChef and Ready Steady Cook, died this month after a battle with cancer 

Pioneer: Burden, pictured for his ITV show Ross in Thailand was an early champion of seasonal produce 

His sister Kirsten Hughes told the New Zealand Herald her brother's death was sudden and unexpected.

Mrs Hughes, who described her sibling as a 'larger than life' figure said Ross had just one paper left to complete his Masters degree in Maori studies at Auckland University.

'He's just a friendly, compassionate guy - nothing was too much trouble. He was my big, fantastic incredible, larger-than-life brother.

'Right up until probably a week-and-a-half ago, he was making his next lot of plans. He had the world map out,' Mrs Hughes said.

Fellow TV stars and celebrity chefs took to Twitter to pay tribute to Burden after his death was announced.

James Martin tweeted: 'Just heard the sad news my old Ready, Steady, Cook colleague Ross Burden has passed away. My thoughts go out to friends and family. RIP Ross'

Phil Vickery added: 'Very sad news my friend and fellow chef Ross Burden died today!

Aldo Zilli wrote: 'Remembering the good times on this very sad day for the Ross Burden family my thoughts are with you.'

Popular: Burden (right, pictured with, left to right, Ainsley Harriott, Leslie Ash and Mark Little) became a high profile chef in the UK in the 1990s, appearing on Ready Steady Cook for a decade

Friends: Burden and Harriott were among the first celebrity chefs and went to publish several recipe books

And Paul Hollywood posted: 'I'm so sorry to hear the news that Ross Burden has died.. appearing for years in Ready, Steady Cook, my thoughts are with his family x'

Burden became a hit with audiences in the UK thanks to his good looks, likeable personality and talent in the kitchen.

An amateur chef, he made it though to the finals of MasterChef in 1993, although he didn't win. 

It didn't seem to matter though, as the New Zealander's profile quickly rose and he began landing many gigs including appearances on Ready Steady Cook, a show he was involved with for a decade. 

Burden also published several recipe books with fellow star Ainsley Harriott as well as running his own catering company. He cooked for Princess Anne and actress Joan Collins among other A-listers.

Mr Harriott told MailOnline: 'I'm very sad to hear about Ross's passing. We had some great times on Ready, Steady, Cook over the years. He certainly was quite a character and also a highly intelligent man. We'll all miss him.'

Family said Burden (pictured, right, with Aldo Zilli, left, and Alan Coxon) was 'compassionate and larger than life'

Burden loved the natural world and became a passionate supporter of the World Wildlife Fund for Nature

His good looks saw him named as one of the UK's most eligible bachelors and 'Britain's tastiest bachelors'. He later came out as gay. 

He was an early champion of the importance of using seasonal produce in recipes and his love of nature led him to become a passionate supporter of the World Wildlife Fund for Nature.

In 2010 he left the UK to return to New Zealand where he became a judge on the local version of MasterChef.

After returning to his home country he also worked as a waiter at Auckland restaurant Sails, telling the New Zealand Herald at the time that he wanted to research the food scene after living abroad for almost two decades.

He is survived by his mother Anne, his sister Kirsten and extended family.
