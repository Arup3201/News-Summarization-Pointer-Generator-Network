A British tourist has drowned at a beach on the holiday island of Lanzarote.

Steve Potter, 43, was spotted floating face down in the water after leaving friends on the beach to go for a swim.

He was seen to be in trouble in the sea and dragged out of the water unconscious, but died at the shoreline after failing to respond to efforts to revive him.

Famara beach in Lanzarote is a popular spot for families and holidaymakers who enjoy surfing and kitesurfing

The results of an autopsy have been sent to an investigating judge put in charge of a routine inquiry into the incident, but have not yet been made public.

A source said: 'He appears to have disappeared out of sight and reappeared a few minutes later floating face down in the water.

'There's nothing to suggest this was anything other than a tragic accident although we haven't been told the exact cause of death.'

Mr Potter, thought to be from the north of England, is understood to have been at Famara Beach in Lanzarote, with friends.

The two-mile long beach, on the northwest coast of the island, is a world-famous surfing and kiteboarding beach used by professionals who often train there.

Spanish film director Pedro Almodovar chose the dramatic setting to shoot key scenes of his 2009 film Broken Embraces, starring Penelope Cruz.

The tragedy happened late on Saturday afternoon.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We can confirm the death of a British national in Lanzarote on April 20.

'We are providing consular assistance to his family at this difficult time.'
