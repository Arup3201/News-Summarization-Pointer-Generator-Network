Shamed cyclist Lance Armstrong shows he has strong support after his doping scandal - as he's mobbed by hundreds of fans while out jogging.

The former champion - hit with a lifetime ban for drugs cheating - went for a run in his trademark yellow top in Mount Royal Park, Montreal, yesterday.

Armstrong, 40, was cheered by fans who clamoured for his autograph after he used social networks to invite them to join him.

The jog came moments after a speech at a cancer conference in which he defiantly introduced himself as a seven-time Tour de France - despite having the victories stripped.

'My name is Lance Armstrong. I am a cancer survivor,' he said to open his speech to the World Cancer Congress.

'I'm a father of five. And yes, I won the Tour de France seven times.'

Armstrong announced last week he would no longer challenge the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency's drug charges against him. USADA threw out his competitive victories dating to 1998, which would include all seven Tour wins.

Armstrong, who has maintained his innocence, focused on his experience as a cancer survivor and the work of his charitable foundation.

He said he struggled to get enough information following his diagnosis in 1996.

'After I left the doctor's office, I was grabbing every pamphlet and flyer I could off the wall,' he said.

'You know what we did after that? We went to the bookstore - remember those things.'

Armstrong also announced his foundation would donate an additional $500,000 to a joint initiative aimed at increasing access to cancer care around the world.

Armstrong briefly returned to the doping scandal at the end of his remarks, vowing it wouldn't impact his charitable work.

'I think the real issue here is one of distraction,' he said. 'I'm going to tell this to you all as if you're friends and partners and allies. I'm not going to be distracted from this fight.'

Earlier this month U.S. anti-doping officials stripped the sports icon of his titles.

The announcement from the US Anti-Doping Agency effectively destroyed his legacy as one of the greatest cyclists in history and rubs a black smudge on a story that inspired millions of fans, drawn to his story of returning to glory after recovering from horrific cancer.

The USADA acted within an hour of Armstrong's announcement that he would stop fighting charges that he used blood doping to illegitimately enhance his performance.

Despite the action, Armstrong maintains his innocence and called the USADA's case a 'witch hunt.'

Moving on: Having already retired from professional cycling a year ago after a criminal investigation into the use of performace boosting drugs, the sporting future for Armstrong is unclear

Armstrong, who retired a year ago, is now officially a drug cheat in the eyes of his nation's doping agency.

USADA chief executive Travis Tygart said earlier that the agency has the authority to remove the titles from the 40-year-old athlete - and would act promptly to do so.

Armstrong argued that only the International Cycling Union, which oversees the Tour de France, has that power.

'USADA cannot assert control of a professional international sport and attempt to strip my seven Tour de France titles,' he said in a statement. 'I know who won those seven Tours, my teammates know who won those seven Tours, and everyone I competed against knows who won those seven Tours.'

USADA maintains that Armstrong has used banned substances as far back as 1996, including the blood-booster EPO and steroids as well as blood transfusions -- all to boost his performance.

'It is a sad day for all of us who love sport and athletes,' Mr Tygart said. 'It's a heartbreaking example of win at all costs overtaking the fair and safe option. There's no success in cheating to win.'

Armstrong declined to enter arbitration - his last option - because he said he was weary of fighting accusations that have dogged him for years. He has consistently pointed to the hundreds of drug tests that he has passed as proof he was clean.

Armstrong's disgrace marks the dizzying fall of an athlete who was regarded as a hero by millions because of his remarkable recovery from testicular cancer.

His foundation has raised some $500million through the sale of iconic 'Livestrong' bracelets, which were seemingly ubiquitous during Armstrong's heyday.

Although he had already been crowned a world champion and won individual stages at the Tour de France, Armstrong was still relatively unknown in the US until he won the epic race for the first time in 1999. It was the ultimate comeback tale: When diagnosed with cancer, doctors had given him less than a 50 percent chance of survival before surgery and brutal cycles of chemotherapy saved his life.

He was diagnosed with cancer in October 1996 and surgeons removed a tumor-ridden testicle during an emergency operation, though the tumors had spread to his lungs, abdomen and brain.

Over the course of two months, he underwent extensive chemotherapy and surgery to combat the cancer.

By January 1998 - one year after his chemotherapy ended - he was back on the bike and aggressively training.

Before his cancer, he had won several stages of the Tour de France in past years, but he attacked the race aggressively - with new passion.

He forged a reputation for himself as a brutal competitor, forcing himself through grueling offseason workouts no one else could match, then crushing his rivals in the Alps and the Pyrenees during the Tour.

His dominance of the Tour de France elevated the sport's popularity in America to unprecedented levels. His story and success enabled him to enlist lawmakers and global policymakers to promote cancer awareness and research. His Lance Armstrong Foundation has raised nearly $500 million since its founding in 1997.

Armstrong walked away from the sport in 2011 without being charged following a two-year federal criminal investigation into many of the same accusations he faces from USADA.
