Expensive drink: The Warren Cup was bought by British Museum trustees 15 years ago for £1.8million

One of the most treasured  exhibits at the British Museum has been denounced as a fake by a German archaeologist.

The Warren Cup – a silver Roman drinking vessel – was picked by the museum’s director Neil MacGregor for his History of the World in 100 Objects series.

Trustees bought it 15 years ago for £1.8million.

But at a public debate, Luca Giuliani challenged the museum’s long-held view that the object dates from the reign of Nero in the first century AD.

The professor of classical archaeology at Humboldt University in Berlin claimed the cup was in fact a creation of the early 20th century

He argued that its explicit depiction of two sets of male lovers was unknown in Roman silverware.

He suggested the cup was designed for the pleasure of its former owner – a wealthy American gay man, Edward Perry Warren, who bought it in Rome in 1911.

Warren acquired other apparently counterfeit pieces before his death in 1928.

The Warren Cup features male lovers in various poses. One pair shows the erastes – an older, active lover – as bearded and wearing a wreath. The  eromenos – the younger, passive beloved – is beardless.

Professor Giuliani’s doubts were aired in Germany last year, but Wednesday marked the first time he has addressed a British audience on the subject.

He told the debate at King’s College London yesterday: ‘There is no other Roman silver tableware with a comparable subject matter.

‘Silver vessels have a completely different iconography. Sexual escapades have no place here.’

Professor  Dyfri Williams, author of a book on the Warren Cup, described his German opposite number as ‘a very intelligent, highly respected scholar’ but told the audience he disagreed with his theories.

The fact that Warren bought other fakes is irrelevant, he said. He also dismissed the uniqueness of the design as evidence of inauthenticity.

He added: ‘We’re really only reacting to each piece when it’s found. We may find something spectacular next week.’
