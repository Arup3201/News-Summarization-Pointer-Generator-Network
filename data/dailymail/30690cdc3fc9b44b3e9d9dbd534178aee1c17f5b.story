Thomas Muller scored his 100th goal for Bayern Munich as they began their defence of the DFB-Pokal with a 4-1 win at third division Preuseen Munster on Sunday.

The German champions made light work of their opponents with Mario Gotze, David Alaba and Claudio Pizarro also on target, though new signing Robert Lewandowski missed a late penalty.

Bayern had lost 2-0 to Borussia Dortmund in the Super Cup on Wednesday but hopes that setback would result in an historic upset here faded when Lewandowski crossed for Gotze to head home the opener on 19 minutes.

Icing on the cake: Claudio Pizarro lifts the ball over Munster goalkeeper Daniel Masuch for 4-0

The first round tie was settled as a contest when Muller scored 10 minutes later, completing a century of competitive goals for the club in the process.

Alaba's powerful shot crashed in off the crossbar after 52 minutes and Muller teed up Pizarro to score the fourth with 17 minutes remaining.

Rogier Krohne scored a late consolation from the penalty spot for Munster and there was still time left for Lewandowski to see his weak spot-kick saved by goalkeeper Daniel Masuch in stoppage time.

Munster midfielder Marc Heitmeier was sent off for brining down the Polish striker, who moved from Borussia Dortmund in the summer.

Thirsty work: Bayern manager Pep Guardiola takes a sip from a water bottle in the dug-out

Bayern defender Holger Badstuber was in competitive action for the first time since tearing the cruciate ligament in his right knee last December, though Pep Guardiola still has Bastian Schweinsteiger, Rafinha, Franck Ribery, Javi Martinez and Thiago Alcantara on the treatment table ahead of the Bundesliga opener against Wolfsburg on Friday.

Elsewhere, Sven Schipplock scored five in Hoffenheim's 9-0 rout of fifth-tier side USC Paloma, Werder Bremen needed extra time to beat fourth-tier FV Illertissen 3-2, and Freiburg defeated Eintracht Trier, another fourth-tier side, 2-0.

Wolfsburg progressed by winning 5-4 on penalties after a scoreless game at second-division Darmstadt. Goalkeeper Max Gruen made two saves in the shootout for the visitors.

Augsburg lost 1-0 to fourth-tier side Magdeburg for the biggest upset of the opening round, and Paderborn, promoted to the Bundesliga this season, lost 2-1 at second-division Leipzig.

We're through: Bayern salute the travelling supporters at the final whistle 

Third-division side Arminia Bielefeld upset second-division SV Sandhausen 4-1, with captain Fabian Klos scoring arguably the goal of the round - a spectacular volley directly from a corner in off the crossbar.

There was another upset later, when fourth-tier Wuerzburger Kickers defeated second-division Fortuna Duesseldorf 3-2 with a deflected free-kick in extra time.

Erzgebirge Aue defeated fourth-tier Carl Zeiss Jena 1-0, 1860 Munich beat third-division Holstein Kiel 2-1 and Karlsruher SC won 3-1 at fifth-tier Neubrandenburg.

Another second-division side, Aalen, defeated fourth-tier BSV Rehden 4-3 on penalties after their game finished 1-1 after extra time.
