Struck off: Anthony Barton, pictured today, appeared before the General Dental Council in 2009 after it emerged he regularly groped nurses' bottoms and tried to undo their bras while at work

A dentist who was struck off after he pranced around his surgery in a leopard-print thong during an affair with a teenage nurse has asked to be allowed to practise again.

Anthony Barton appeared before the General Dental Council in 2009 after it emerged he regularly groped nurses' bottoms, twanged their knicker elastic and tried to undo their bras while at work.

He also had a relationship with one 19-year-old trainee and the pair would have sex in the toilets and in his office at the Red Rose Dental Group in Wigan, Greater Manchester.  

Barton also asked another dental nurse, who was a teenager when she started working for him, if she could wear a thong to work.

He was hauled before the council to answer more than a dozen charges of 'inappropriate behaviour' towards female members of staff.

The 41-year-old was found guilty of 'unprofessional, inappropriate and indecent' sexual conduct towards three women at the practice between 2000 and 2008. 

He was found guilty of ‘unprofessional and inappropriate’ conduct towards a fourth young dental nurse and was struck off for ‘a serious breach of trust of several vulnerable employees'. 

But today, Barton, who has been married twice, told the General Dental Council that he had he had 'grown up a lot' and that he was 'very immature' at the time. 

He said: 'I have come to understand where my conduct fell short of what was to be expected.

‘It is quite clear to me now looking back that a lot of my actions were completely inappropriate and had no place in practise at all. I have grown up a lot.

‘I think I was very immature. I was very young at the time when certain aspects of the behaviour began. It seems like a different person and I can’t believe a lot of the behaviour which happened.’

Barton told the panel he was now working as a manager at a Smiles Dental in Anglesey, Wales. 

‘The main role is running the business side of dentistry, so ensuring that the process runs smoothly on a day-to-day basis’, he said.

The company has now been bought by the large dental care provider Oasis, Barton said, adding he had been elected ‘staff representative’ during the acquisition.

He said he would regularly chat with practitioners on ‘all matters dental’ and now had a ‘far wider’ knowledge of dentistry.

‘There are so many things I know now that I never knew as a dentist’, he said.

Barton said he was trusted to be around lone females at the surgery and there had been ‘no complaints at all’. ‘Often, there may just be myself and another member of staff’, he said. 

He said he would regularly chat with practitioners on ‘all matters dental’ and now had a ‘far wider’ knowledge of dentistry.  

Barton said he was trusted to be around lone females at the surgery and there had been ‘no complaints at all’. 

His employers have even offered to give Barton a ‘supervised and mentored role’ if the GDC allows him to re-register.

Barton also discussed taking practical and online courses to keep his knowledge of dentistry up to scratch, including ‘tutorial sessions on professionalism and ethics’.  

Gabriel Beeby, for the General Dental Council, introduced the case, saying Barton ‘had been unprofessional, inappropriate and participated in sexualised conduct'.

The 2009 tribunal was told how Barton 'pranced around' his surgery in a thong during a six-month affair with 19-year-old known only as Ms B. 

During his five-day misconduct hearing he admitted he was 'guilty of crossing the line' with his employees and was found guilty of 17 charges. 

One victim, known only as Ms D, told the hearing of her disgust when his sexual innuendos took a physical twist and he began to ‘gratuitously grope’ her bottom in the office.

She told the hearing: ‘I remember my trousers fell down a bit so I pulled them up myself. Mr Barton was standing behind me and thought that was a good opportunity to feel my bottom.

‘I think that’s the day he said I had a nice a***.’

Ms D was forced to call in sick the next day and bosses finally investigated complaints from several of the nurses.

Barton, from Warrington, Cheshire, admitted having a six-month affair with  Ms B and was found guilty of having sex with her during surgery hours.

He was found guilty of multiple allegations of touching Ms A, Ms C and Ms D, and that his behaviour was ‘unprofessional, inappropriate and indecent.’ 

The hearing to determine his restoration application continues.
