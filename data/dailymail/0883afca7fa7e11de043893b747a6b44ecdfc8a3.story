David Dunn is in talks with Blackburn over a new contract which could see him handed a player-coach role.

The 34-year-old has been at Ewood Park for 14 years, split over two spells, but he is now a free agent.

However, Blackburn are keen to give him another deal where he can also take on coaching responsibilities.

Dunn said: 'I want to carry on playing and will be in contention for every game.

'If there is a possibility that this is my last season as a player then I want to make sure I get Blackburn back into the Premier League where they belong.

'It's great to know Blackburn are thinking about me as a coach and want me to hang around but I'll keep contributing as a player until my body tells me not to.'
