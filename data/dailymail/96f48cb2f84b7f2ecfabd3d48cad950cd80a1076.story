Leicester defender Wes Morgan felt a point against Arsenal was the least his side were worthy of.

Leo Ulloa cancelled out Alexis Sanchez's opener for the Gunners as the sides played out a 1-1 draw at the King Power Stadium.

'I think that was the least we deserved,' the impressive Morgan told Sky Sports 1.

'We created quite a few chances, we might not have had the most of the possession, but we had chances.

'We concentrated well, worked hard to limit their chances.

'People watching will see our performance and know Leicester are a team they cannot take lightly.'

Ulloa's header was his second goal since moving from Brighton in the summer and came while he was carrying an injury.

'I am happy because we have one point more, the team played well. I am happy for the team,' he said.

'The cross is fantastic, a really good one. I worked for that and I am happy.

'I got a kick on the calf and it was painful, but it's okay, not bad.'

City boss Nigel Pearson found positives and negatives in his side's performance.

'It was another illustration of how the Premier League can be. I think we've played better, but we still had flashes of the ability to create things. That's going to be pivotal for us this season,' he said.

'We felt that against a very good possession side, we did all the hard work we needed to and looked dangerous on the counter.'

For Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger it was a case of not doing enough in front of goal.

They created 24 chances but took just one and, with Olivier Giroud out until January, the Frenchman was again probed about whether or not he wants to buy a striker before the window shuts on Monday.

'(It was) tough, tough, we could have maybe got the goal and after that we didn't create enough today. They fought very hard,' he said.

'Look, the decision is not to make, it's to find personnel. We are open, we work on it, but let's not fool ourselves. Man City lost against Stoke and had strikers, it's not just about buying one player.

'We want to and we are open to it. The pressure to buy is always there, we have to live with that, we try our best'
