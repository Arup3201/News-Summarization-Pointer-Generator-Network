Rooney - Sterling - Welbeck

Sturridge

Roy Hodgson will start Raheem Sterling, Danny Welbeck and Wayne Rooney in behind Daniel Sturridge up front for England's World Cup opener against Italy.

Sterling will take up the No 10 role in the attacking three, having not put a foot wrong in training.

Welbeck has overcome his injury problems and is fit to start for the Three Lions, providing Hodgson with added pace on the wing.

For Italy, manager Cesare Prandelli has selected Mario Balotelli to start up front against England.

Balotelli

Plenty rallied for Sterling to be given his chance, particularly after giving a good report of himself in the Liverpool's Premier League campaign, England's World Cup warm-ups and during training in Rio.

The 19-year-old has been given his wish, and can repay Hodgson's faith in England's opener.

Rooney's place in the team has 
been questioned by fans and pundits alike, but Hodgson has kept faith 
with the Manchester United striker and will fit him on the wing of the 
trio.

There is no space for Adam Lallana to start in the 4-5-1 formation, despite his impressive form in the World Cup warm-ups.

Italy boss Prandelli looks set to go on the front foot, too, having named Balotelli up front.

But he remains without goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, who has a twisted ankle, as replacement Salvatore Sirigu, with eight caps, steps in.

Chance: Roy Hodgson is prepared to give Sterling an opportunity to shine for England as he has done in training

Starter: Sterling will fit into England's line-up against Italy as he takes up the No 10 role
