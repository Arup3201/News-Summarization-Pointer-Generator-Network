Fear of dementia is causing hundreds of thousands of sufferers to delay seeking treatment for the illness.

A survey has found that more than half of patients admit putting off seeing a doctor for at least six months after noticing symptoms.

Fifty-two per cent of the estimated 800,000 people suffering from the condition in the UK are yet to receive a diagnosis, according to the Alzheimer’s Society.

Research involving 1,043 patients showed 41 per cent said they had kept concerns about dementia bottled up – mainly because they feared upsetting family or they did not want to face the reality of the condition.

The high numbers who are failing to talk about the condition has added to these difficulties, the charity said.

The study for the Alzheimer’s Society, conducted online, showed 54 per cent had waited for six months or more after first noticing symptoms of dementia in themselves or someone close to them before seeking professional help.

Jeremy Hughes, chief executive of the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘One in three people over the age of 65 will develop dementia, so it is worrying that so many people would feel reluctant to seek help about it.

‘The Dementia Friends programme has put dementia back in the spotlight but the fact remains that thousands of people remain in denial about the condition. Talking about dementia can be difficult and we all bury our heads in the sand from time to time.

'But the sooner you know what you are dealing with, the sooner you can feel in control again and get on with your life.’

The findings have been released in Dementia Awareness Week.

A separate YouGov poll of 2,358 adults found dementia is the condition people are most reluctant to seek help for, compared with other health issues including serious heart and digestive problems.

Fifty-seven per cent of adults who have had a health problem in the past year have put off seeking help about it, nearly half of them because they thought they would be ‘making a fuss’.

Twenty-three per cent of those who had put off seeking help said it was because they feared it was a serious health problem, such as dementia.

Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, told the Telegraph: ‘Dementia is a growing, global challenge and one of the most significant healthcare issues we face in the country.

‘The Government is determined to tackle this head on, but we also need as a whole society to respond to the disease.’

A host of celebrities – including Amanda Holden, Chris Martin, Lily Allen and Alesha Dixon – are starring in an advert aimed at encouraging people to join the ‘Dementia Friends’ campaign.

Also involved is author Sir Terry Pratchett, who suffers from Alzheimer’s disease himself.
