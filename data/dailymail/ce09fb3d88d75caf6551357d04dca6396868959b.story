yesterday, bringing the total currently detained in connection with the

Officers 
said the violence was thought to be part of an ongoing dispute between

Two other men from Birmingham, aged 22 and 25, were also arrested on suspicion of murder on Friday.

The
 duo are currently receiving medical attention, with the 25-year-old in 
critical condition with slash wounds. The other suffered from a gunshot 
wound but is not thought to have life-threatening injuries.

Four
 men aged between 24 and 27 were previously arrested on suspicion of 
murder late on Thursday night and they remain in custody.

Superintendent Bas Javid, of West Midlands Police, said: 'The investigation continues and we are working hard to establish the full circumstances of what has happened.

'We appreciate how unsettling this is for the community especially when guns and knives are used.

Police are waiting to question two suspects arrested on suspicion of murder as they are still in hospital. One, a 25-year-old, is in critical condition with slash wounds, while another has a gunshot wound

'We would encourage people not to 
speculate and again I would reiterate that there is nothing to suggest 
this will spark any further disorder.

'We
 remain in close liaison with local communities and we are listening to 
any concerns they may have as well as keeping them as up to date with 
the investigation as possible.'

A
 witness to the carnage, who did not want to be named, added: 'I heard a
 gunshot and looked out of my window to see a man with his face covered 
running away from the scene wielding a bat.

'Another guy was walking away and his arm was completely shredded and there was a lot of blood.

'I could hear someone down the road screaming and shouting "I've been shot" again and again.

Aftermath: Police cordon off a Sparkbrook street after violence erupted involving 300 people last night

'Police arrived and taped off the road but there were tons of people around.

'There
 was a huge crowd of young boys and they stayed for another couple of 
hours and kept making a commotion, but left at about 9.30pm.'

One
 shopkeeper, who did not want to be indentified, said he had been 
locking up for the day at about 7.20pm when he saw a 'large group' had 
gathered.

He said: 'There were about 200 to 300 lads hanging around, it was a large number. Then after that lots of police came down.

'Customers have told me it's a murder investigation but I don't know what it's about.'
