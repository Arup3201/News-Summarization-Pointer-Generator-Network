A new biography of disgraced Penn State football coach Joe Paterno is laying out new details about his relationship with Jerry Sandusky, including the fact that the two hardly got along - if ever.

In his biography, Paterno, former Sports Illustrated columnist Joe Posnanski writes that the once-iconic coach became irritated with his defensive coordinator when he realised that Sandusky's first priority did not appear to be Penn State football.

Paterno, affectionately called 'JoePa' by students, was apparently bothered that Sandusky was focused more on his charity, the Second Mile, than team meetings and recruiting new players.

The Second Mile was later found to be the organisation through which Sandusky met and groomed his victims.

In the book, which was published today, Posnanski writes: 'The tension between Paterno and Sandusky gurgled just below the surface.'

As the scandal erupted, it was revealed that Paterno had been told by graduate assistant Mike McQueary that Sandusky had raped a boy in the Penn State locker room showers.

In addition, an independent report conducted by former FBI director Louis Freeh, concluded that Paterno, as well as other Penn State bigwigs, 'failed to protect against a child sexual predator harming children for over a decade.'

Posnanski's book, however disputes those claims, saying that Paterno did not know Sandusky had sexually abused children, and when he read the list of charges against Sandusky, he asked his son Scott: 'What is sodomy, anyway?'

Speaking to Sports Illustrated shortly after his retirement in December 1999, Sandusky gave a small glimpse into his relationship with Paterno when asked if he’d miss him.

Sandusky said: 'Well, not exactly. You have to understand that so much of our time was spent under stress, figuring out how to win. That takes a toll. We've had our battles.

‘I've quit. I've been fired. I've walked around the building to cool off.'

But Sandusky was not his only enemy, as the book reveals that Paterno, who coached the team for nearly 50 years, had bad blood with the Penn State board of trustees, according to Dan 
McGinn, the PR specialist who worked with the Paterno family when the 
scandal broke.

As 
early as 2004, Paterno had clashed with Penn State University President 
Graham Spanier and did not have allies who would support him, McGinn 
said, citing Paterno family adviser Guido D'Elia.

'The board started to turn [in 2004], we don't have anybody on the board now,' D'Elia told McGinn.

Posnanski's book also details the moments after Paterno was fired at the height of the Sandusky scandal, saying that the news was met with nonstop tears.

'Paterno met with his coaches at his house. He sobbed uncontrollably. This was his bad day,' Posanksi writes in his biography, Paterno.

After
Sandusky was arrested on November 5, 2011 and charged with multiple 
counts of sexual abuse, Paterno said on November 9 that he would resign 
at the end of the season from his coaching post at Penn State after 46 
years.

But the Penn State 
board rejected his resignation and instead voted to fire Paterno, 
delivering the news in a late night telephone call.

'My
name. I have spent my whole life trying to make that name mean 
something. And now it's gone,' he told his son Jay, who had served on 
the coaching staff of the Penn State Nittany Lions football team under 
his father.

On November 18, the family revealed that Paterno was suffering from a treatable form of lung cancer.

On January 22, 2012, Paterno died at the age of 85.

An
independent report of the scandal, conducted by former FBI director 
Louis Freeh, concluded that Paterno, president Graham Spanier, athletic 
director Tim Curley and vice president Gary Schultz 'failed to protect 
against a child sexual predator harming children for over a decade.'

The report, released in July, called the school officials 'callous’ for their disregard of the child victims.

After
a highly publicized trial in June 2012, Sandusky, 68, was convicted on 
45 criminal counts for sexually abusing 10 victims.

He will be sentenced in September.
