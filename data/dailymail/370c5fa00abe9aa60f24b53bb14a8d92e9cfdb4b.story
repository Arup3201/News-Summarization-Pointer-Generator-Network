The number of families struggling to pay for their healthcare has come down slightly, but one in five families still struggles to pay for medical bills, federal researchers found.

Figures showed that 20.3 per cent of people under 65 are in families that had trouble paying a medical bill during the first half of 2012.

The figure was down from 21.7 per cent in the first half of 2011, the National Center for Health Statistics found.

The numbers will be closely scrutinized as the U.S. moves towards healthcare reform. The 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, is designed to get more people covered by health insurance and, in theory, take away some of the financial burdens.

In the health statistics study Robin Cohen and colleagues looked at data from national surveys for their report.

They excluded people who are 65 or older because they have the right to coverage by Medicare, the federal health insurance plan for the elderly.

However, a quarter of those who had public health insurance such as Medicare or Medicaid struggled to pay for their medical care, the survey found.

'In the first 6 months of 2012, among persons under age 65, 36.3 per cent of those who were uninsured, 14 per cent of those who had private coverage, and 25.6 per cent of those who had public coverage were in families having problems paying medical bills,'  the report said.

The figures come after research found last month that people who have cancer diagnosed have a greater risk of bankruptcy, even if they have insurance.

The U.S. has one of the highest healthcare costs among developed nations, with about 50 million Americans unable to pay for health insurance, according to the Huffington Post.

The study found however, that even those with private healthcare struggled to pay their expenses.

While 30 per cent of families who live below the poverty line of $22,350 for a family of four, reported difficulties in paying their medical bills, 14 per cent of families two times over the poverty threshold  also struggled, the report found.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that Obamacare will reduce the number of uninsured people to 27 million by 2023.

While it is not designed to replace private health insurance, one of Obamacare's plans is to prevent health insurance companies discriminating against patients with pre-existing conditions.

It would allow people who earn just over $15,000 to claim Medicaid and provide tax credits for private healthcare.

Part of the reason why families struggle is because medical procedures and treatment cost far more in the U.S. than in comparable countries.

The New York Times found that on average an American pays four times more for a hip replacement  than patients in France or Switzerland, while a Nasonex nasal spray for allergies costs $108 in the U.S. and only $21 in Spain.

The high cost of treatment can, in some cases, deter people from seeking help early on which means their health deteriorates and potentially becomes more expensive.
