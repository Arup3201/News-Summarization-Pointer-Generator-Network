A petite events waitress has told how she was bottled in the face by a thug who she asked to stop following her round a nightclub.

April Parslow, 22, was left needing five stitches and felt forced to move cities by 29-year-old Nikki Harrison, who attacked her just weeks after she moved to Newcastle with her boyfriend.

Harrison grabbed the 5ft 2in clubber around the throat, left her covered in blood and scarred her for life during his assault - but was spared jail by a judge at Newcastle Crown Court.

Instead he was handed a 12-month suspended sentence with a three-month curfew and 150 hours of unpaid work after he admitted unlawful wounding and assault.

He was also told to pay £2,130 compensation to Miss Parslow and £500 to a friend of hers who was hurt as he tried to intervene.

Miss Parslow moved to Newcastle with her boyfriend Adam Ruys in November 2013 and went on her first night out with work friends shortly after Christmas.

They were in the city centre's Madame Koo nightclub when Harrison bumped into her, spilled his drink, stared at her and followed her around.

When she told him to leave he smashed his beer bottle repeatedly at her forehead, leaving her needing five stitches and eight painkiller injections at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary.

Harrison's violent assault only stopped when bar staff came and intervened. He was restrained by bouncers until he was arrested.

Miss Parslow, a keen traveller who is originally from Surrey, said she was left scarred and frightened to go out in Newcastle city centre at night time. 

She and her boyfriend left the area after just two months and are now living for a year in Ontario, Canada.

'I didn't do anything to the man who attacked me,' she said. 'I was new to the area and went out in a big group to make friends at work and he singled me out and wouldn't leave me alone.

'He approached me and wouldn't stop staring. I found him really creepy and tried to walk away but he wouldn't let me out of his sight.

'He wouldn't stop staring so I asked him what his problem was and he threw the drink over me.

'He then grabbed me by the throat and glassed me. I started screaming really loudly because there was blood everywhere, all over my face, outfit and shoes.

'I'd only lived in the area for a month and it ruined my life in that city.

'It's disgusting that a man can do that to a woman and think it's acceptable. If someone says no they should back off.

'I had constant nightmares and my boyfriend and I had to move house because I didn't feel safe. 

'Eventually, two months later, I couldn't take it any more and we moved away from the city back down south.

'I felt completely isolated and so we headed back to Ibiza for the summer because it was where we had met.

'Despite the nightlife scene out there, I didn't feel afraid because I was with Adam.

'My boyfriend, Adam, is extremely protective of me and I don't usually like to go on nights out if he is not there now as he is 6ft 7in and I only feel like I am safe when he is there.

'I was left with a scar on my forehead and I have to wear my hair a certain way now because I get paranoid when people can see it.'

Harrison was sentenced in August 2014, but this is the first time his victim has felt brave enough to speak out.

At the time, the court heard Harrison was so drunk he could not recall what happened but appeared shocked when told what he had done.

He and the victim were both on the dance floor, which was busy, and Harrison bumped into her more than once and spilled some of his drink on her.

She asked if he had missed his mouth and he stared at her. 

Prosecutor Neil Pallister said: 'A few minutes later he grabbed her round the throat, squeezing it tightly. She was in a bit of a panic and had difficulty breathing.

'He then hit her to the top of the head with a bottle.

'She said others appeared to release his grip but he grabbed her again.

'Her friend said there was one blow followed by two or three further blows which connected with her head, as he was being pulled away.'

Miss Parslow's friend Philip Fletcher was also hurt in the attack as he tried to intervene, the court heard.

Paul Caulfield, defending, said: 'These offences are an aberration. He has expressed regret and remorse.'

But Judge John Evans told Harrison: 'The two victims were enjoying a night out when, for reasons best known to yourself, you decided to smash a bottle across the heads of the two of them.

'Why someone with your history should decide to behave in that way is difficult to comprehend.'

Miss Parslow said: 'Now I know it is over and the guy has been punished, I feel like I can finally move on with my life and get over it.

'Now he has faced justice I feel it is a step forward. I am getting there and hopefully one day soon I'll feel 100 per cent confident in going out alone.

'I'm only young and I don't know why Harrison singled me out. In a way I feel as though he has made me miss out on a lot, but I don't want him to win.'
