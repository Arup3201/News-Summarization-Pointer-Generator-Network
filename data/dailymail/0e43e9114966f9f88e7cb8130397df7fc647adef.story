The police complaints commission today admitted that only 21 out of 8,000 corruption allegations against officers had been investigated, as a damning assessment of the watchdog's shortcomings was published.

Chairwoman Dame Anne Owers said she did not have the resources to do more, after a report by MPs attacked the organisation as ‘woefully under-equipped and hamstrung'.

More than 200 officers a year are escaping disciplinary charges by retiring or resigning, the report warned.

Staggeringly, last year nearly one in every four officers was subject of a complaint, amounting to a total of 31,771 in England and Wales.

Lacking resources: Chairwoman Dame Anne Owers admitted that the IPCC is under-resourced, as MP Keith Vaz said it is 'woefully under-equipped' to do its job

But in a scathing report, the Home Affairs Select Committee warns of a public suspicion that ‘police are getting away with misconduct and criminality’ because the Independent Police Complaints Commission cannot get to the truth.

'We need more resources and we need more powers,' Dame Owers said today. 'We cannot do the job the public expect us to be able to do.'

But solicitor Raju Bhatt argued that the IPCC was failing to make 'effective use of the powers and the resources that they already have', on Radio 4 this morning.

He said that what was needed a 'change in culture'.

Of 8547 corruption allegations, 837 were referred to the IPCC, 21 investigated, 18 prosecuted and just 13 found guilty.

Serious cases of police corruption are ‘under-investigated’ the report says, as the IPCC concentrates on less serious accusations.

Committee chairman Keith Vaz said the IPCC was insulting victims by just ‘scratching the surface’ of serious alleged abuses.

Evidence: The committee made their conclusions after hearing from witnesses such as Doreen Lawrence, left, who said she had 'no confidence' in the IPCC and examining the case of PC Simon Harwood, who 'retired' before he was disciplined for attacking newspaper vendor Ian Tomlinson

He warned of a ‘complaints roundabout’
where cases are first investigated internally by the accused force, but
are then appealed to the IPCC because the complainant is unhappy.

The
report revealed that one in three such cases is overturned by the IPCC 
because of failures in the initial investigation. As a result, the IPCC 
was ‘overloaded’ with appeal cases, MPs said.

Committee
chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘When public trust in the police is tested by 
complaints of negligence, misconduct and corruption, a strong watchdog 
is vital to get to the truth - but the IPCC leaves the public frustrated
and faithless.’

He added: 
‘Nearly a quarter of officers were subject to a complaint last year. 
Many were trivial, but some were extremely serious, involving deaths in 
custody or corruption -it is an insult to all concerned to do no more 
than scratch the surface of these alleged abuses.

‘The
IPCC investigated just a handful and often arrived at the scene late, 
when the trail had gone cold. The Commission is on the brink of letting 
grave misconduct go uninvestigated.’

The
IPCC is currently investigating the Hillsborough disaster in what 
investigators say is the biggest ever inquiry into police misconduct, 
during which it will be given new powers and additional funding.

MPs took evidence from victims of police misconduct, their lawyers, police representatives and ministers. Doreen Lawrence, the mother of Stephen Lawrence, told the committee she had ‘no confidence in [the commission] whatsoever’.

The committee recommended that IPCC investigators should take ‘immediate control’ of an investigation of serious injury or death involving police officers.

Serious corruption cases - including evidence tampering - should automatically land with the IPCC instead of a force’s internal complaints department.

They also concluded that the IPCC needed a legal power to require a force to implement its recommendations after something goes wrong.

During the investigation of the death of newspaper vendor Ian Tomlinson, it emerged that the police officer who attacked him, PC Simon Harwood, had ducked ten complaints by switching forces, including a road-rage attack, racial abuse and a series of heavy-handed arrests.

He ‘retired’ from the Met on medical grounds on the eve of a disciplinary hearing, only to rejoin within days on its civilian staff. After transferring to a separate force, Surrey, he then returned to the Met in 2005 as a police officer.

IPCC chairman Dame Anne Owers backed the call for more resources and powers.

She said: ‘This report recognises that we do not yet have the resources or powers to do all that the public rightly expects and needs from us. That is what we have been saying for a long time.

‘Without that, we will continue to struggle to meet the legitimate expectations of complainants and of families who have lost someone in tragic circumstances.’
