A man who needed to answer the call of nature in Scottish woodland got the shock of his life after he was confronted by a massive snake.

Iain Lowson had stopped in a lay-by near Torphichen in West Lothian to urinate behind a tree when he spotted what he initially thought was 'a funny-looking log' on the forest floor.

The 'log' turned out to be a 6ft boa constrictor believed to have been dumped by its owners in the woods.

Iain Lowson had stopped in a lay-by near Torphichen in West Lothian to urinate behind a tree when he spotted what he initially thought was 'a funny-looking log' on the forest floor...

Mr Lowson, 63, said today: 'I had been driving back from Bathgate when I had a call of nature.

'I went into the woods and looked down and thought, "That's a funny-looking log".

'It took me a second but then I noticed the markings and headed round the tree and saw the rest of the body and the head and realised it was a big snake.

'I was surprised to say the least.

'Luckily I'm not one of those people who is very afraid of them and he was very sluggish but it was still a shock.

'You don't expect to pop into the woods and see a massive snake.

'It was lucky I didn't pee on it.'

Mr Lowson, a retired civil servant, called the police, who informed the Scottish SPCA of his discovery.

The animal charity believe the snake was abandoned and is fortunate to have survived out in the cold weather.

The creature, which only weighs 5kg, is now in the care of the charity's Edinburgh and Lothians Animal Rescue and Rehoming Centre at Balerno, where it has been named Hank.

Inspector Jennifer Surgeon said: 'It's highly likely Hank has been abandoned due to the remoteness of the location he was found in.

'He is very lucky to have survived his ordeal as the cold weather could easily have killed him.

'Hank was extremely subdued and completely limp when I picked him up and we weren't sure whether he was even alive.

'However, after spending time warming him up beside the radiator in my van, Hank soon began moving again.'

Mr Lowson said: 'There was straw nearby when I found the snake and I think someone had just stopped at the same lay-by as me and dumped it.

'There is really no need for this. I'm sure there are plenty of places that could have taken it.'

Ms Surgeon added: 'He has now been vet checked and is receiving onward care and attention at our centre.

'Despite the circumstances Hank was found in, he appears to be in good overall health.

'We are appealing to the public to contact our Animal Helpline if they recognise Hank and know who might have owned him as abandoning an animal is an offence.

'In the meantime, we'll look after Hank until we can find him a loving new home.'

Boa constrictors are native to Central and South America and can grow to up to 13ft long.

They grab and hold onto their prey with small, hooked teeth and then wrap their bodies around their victims and squeeze tightly until the animal they've caught can no longer breathe.

Anyone with information is being urged to contact the Scottish SPCA Animal Helpline on 03000 999 999.
