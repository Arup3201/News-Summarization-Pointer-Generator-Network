A novice driver has been caught on camera motoring along a busy highway with his hands behind his head.

The man - who was said to have driven for a distance of up to 20 kilometres with his hands resting behind his head instead of on the steering wheel - was filmed by a stunned witness in Melbourne, Australia.

The rogue driver is thought to have been using his knees to steer his Mazda 3, which was fitted with P-plates to indicate a probationary licence holder.

The footage of the stunt was sent to an Australian newspaper.

Officers from the Frankston Highway Patrol have now charged a 20-year-old man with reckless conduct likely to cause serious injury, driving in a dangerous manner, and failing to have full and proper control ofÂ  motor vehicle.

Police had received reports of a man driving with no hands on the Frankston Freeway and Moorooduc Highway at around 6.30pm on Sunday evening, according to the Herald Sun.

The 20-year-old suspect, from Thornbury, was released on bail and is due to appear at Frankston Magistrates' Court on April 3.
