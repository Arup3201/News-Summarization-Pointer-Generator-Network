Former gynecologist Bruce Sylvester Smith was finally sentenced to 18 years in prison on Tuesday for raping a pregnant patient while performing an exam on her in his office in Chicago's South Side in 2002 following a bungled investigation.

The victim, who was eight months pregnant at the time and cannot be identified, struggled as she explained the attack while taking to the witness stand, saying that even though it happened 11 years ago, she has never gotten over the pain.

She was lying on an examination table with her legs in stirrups on August 2, 2002, when Smith, 60, grabbed her legs and penetrated her, according to CBS.

'How do I describe the feeling of nasty and dirty, never being able to wash that feeling away, never being able to wash him away?' she told the court.

'It's like an endless knot in the pit of my belly that never goes away.

'It never goes away.

'I am afraid and paranoid all the time

'I am afraid to be seen by a doctor, not just men (but) women too.'

'I put the health and care of myself and the health and care of my unborn child in his hands, but he violated that trust and he abused his position.

'He violated me in the worst way possible.'

The prosecution called Smith 'despicable' and 'a liar' after he testified the sex was consensual.

'He blamed her for it,' Assistant State’s Attorney Annette Milleville said.

'He shattered (her trust) into a million pieces in the most despicable manner.'

Although the rape took place well over a decade ago, Smith wasn’t arrested for crime until 2010, with prosecutors forced to admit 'mistakes were made' in their investigation.

The woman, a teaching assistant, immediately called her sister after the attack, who contacted a rape hotline.

At a counselor's urging, the woman underwent a rape exam at the University of Chicago Hospital on the day of the assault.

Days later she filed a complaint with Chicago police.

However the prosecutor who initially reviewed the case in 2002 declined to press charges pending further evidence.

The case was later closed and the rape kit sat untested for years.

Then in 2009 Smith’s medical license was suspended for nine months after several women came forward, accusing him of sexual misconduct.

As the stories and allegations against Smith started to multiply, with numerous being documented by The Chicago Tribune, a detective sent the kit to a lab.

The results matched DNA to Smith.

Smith was never charged in any other case, although there were many.

One former patient who went public with her allegations against Smith said he raped her during a pelvic exam in 2000 when she was 19 and her legs were in stirrups.

Tameka Stokes said she broke down crying as she left the exam room and a nurse immediately called police.

A rape exam did not turn up Smith's semen and prosecutors declined to press charges.

'You go into the doctor trusting them, thinking they'll do the right thing for you and you come out feeling humiliated like that's been taken away from you,' Stokes told authorities during a 2008 state hearing.

Smith chose not to say anything in court before he was sentenced.

But Assistant Public Defender Armando Sandoval spoke on Smith’s behalf describing how the father of five grew up poor and enlisted in the U.S.

Army and worked as a teacher before putting himself through medical school.

Because of his legal troubles, Smith’s second marriage ended, Sandoval told the judge in hopes of Smith avoiding the maximum 30-year sentence.

He was sentenced to 18 years prison.
