It’s not the usual way Boris Bikes are handled.

A new video reveals how daredevil mountain-bike athletes carried out tricks and jumps across London – all to raise awareness of the lack of free urban spaces in the capital.

Andrei Burton and Joe Seddon, both renowned in their field, teamed up with award-winning freerunners Tim Shieff and Paul Joseph to complete breathtaking stunts on famous landmarks across the city skyline.

High in London: The footage shows how the daredevils used Boris Bikes to ride across the capital's rooftops

Don't look down! Andrei Burton and Joe Seddon ride Boris Bikes across London Bridge

From 
Marble Arch and London Bridge, to Oxford Circus and St Paul’s Cathedral, the video
 – set to Prince’s Controversy track – has been released as a call to Mayor Boris Johnson 
to increase the number of create spaces.

The
 footage shows the usually clunky cycles, used by tourists and commuters
 to get around the capital, wheeled out of a shop in East London, then 
ridden along the edges of London Bridge, across the river Thames.

After passing
 commuters and red buses, Burton – one of the UK’s most successful 
mountain bike trials athletes – and previous British Elite Champion 
Seddon jump on their bikes from the roof of Marble Arch Tube station, wheeling across 
high-rise balconies and hopping over roofs.

They meet 
freerunners Shieff and Joseph who join in the tricks, with one 
backflipping over a car, and the other hangs from Millennium Bridge, 
with St Paul's in the background.

For the finale, the foursome flip over rooftops and ride their bikes across the tops of buildings close to Bond Street. 

Released
 by FightMe, a collaborative social video network, the project aims to help young 
people ‘showcase and develop their creative talent’.

Joelle Hadfield, CEO, said: ’We wanted to creatively be part of doing something different and as a London-based start-up, we wanted to showcase our city in the best way possible. 

‘It was also a lot of fun - it was great to inject some playful humour, challenges and out of the box thinking into the streets of London.’

FightMe’s chairman Jamie Lorenz added: ‘FightMe is a virtual playground for people to express views and talents using video. Videos are joined together through playful competition, collaboration and creating conversation.  

‘Inviting users to ‘Join the Fight’ is inviting them to participate in a forum where they're challenged to be better through the support and encouragement of a community. Creating videos with the purpose of others joining in is a direct alternative to the selfie model other networks have come to embody. 

‘A supportive community encourages users to express without doubt as strength comes in numbers.’
