We all know that talking while driving can be distracting.

But it is a 'recipe for disaster' when done while attempting a tricky right-hand turn into oncoming traffic, according to scientists.

Scans showed that performing simple tasks, such as driving straight, resulted in minimal brain activation, while undertaking a difficult manoeuvre needed the most brain power.

Researchers found the activity in parts of the brain that deal with vision and decision-making - needed to tackle a right-hand turn - is 'significantly reduced' when chatting.

The Canadian research team said the results have 'important implications regarding distracted driving' and the use of hands-free car kits.

'Our findings suggest that the distracted brain sacrificed areas important for visual attention and alertness to recruit enough brain resources to perform a secondary, cognitive task [speaking],' the report concluded.

Lead author Dr Tom Schweizer, director at St Michael Hospital's Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute in Toronto, said when British drivers perform a right turn while talking, it 'could be the most dangerous thing they ever do on the road'.

He said: 'In theory, turning right is the most difficult aspect of driving in Britain, because you having to consider oncoming traffic, traffic lights, and if pedestrians are crossing in the lane you are turning into.

'With hands-free kits, despite the fact that you are not holding on to a device, you are still being distracted from the primary task of driving. There is only so much brain resources available.

'In crude terms, when we are talking, parts of the visual system shut down to allow the communications system to come on line. So less of our brain is devoted to the task of driving.'

The research, published in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, involving testing 16 young drivers who were operating a driving simulator equipped with a steering wheel, brake pedal and accelerator inside an MRI brain scanner.

This allowed them to map in real time which parts of the brain were activated or deactivated as the simulator took participants through increasingly difficult driving manoeuvres.

Tasks included making turns at intersections with or without oncoming traffic or driving with distractions that mimicked talking on a hands free mobile phone or engaging in a conversation with a passenger.

'This study provides real-time neuroimaging evidence supporting previous behavioural observations suggesting that multitasking while driving may compromise vision and alertness. Hands free not does mean brains free,' said Dr Schweizer.

'We have finite resources, and when we begin a discussion, the brain starts to shift resources. But you need all these resources to carry out a complicated driving manoeuvre safely.

'The brain data showed that a distraction really does reduce the brain's ability to react drastically.'

The scientists warned that car manufacturers may also have to reconsider the design of vehicles, which increasingly have in-built devices that can be a distraction to drivers.

The report found: 'Automobile manufacturers also have a responsibility to improve safety by refraining from installing various communication devices in vehicles, or by installing deactivation systems if drivers attempt to use the devices while the car is in motion.'
