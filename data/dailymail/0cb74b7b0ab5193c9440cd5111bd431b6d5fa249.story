Al-Qaeda have released a video teaching their fighters how to make 'invisibility cloaks' to avoid detection from U.S. drones.

In the 16-minute instruction video, called 'Combatting Spy Airplanes', the terrorist group in the Arabian Peninsula explains that the shield can be easily assembled using aluminium foil and twigs.  

According to the video, largely complied from U.S. military public relations clips, the shield works by stopping a U.S Predator drone's infrared camera from detecting human heat.

The cloak works by stopping a U.S Predator drone's infrared camera from detecting human heat and is made by gluing aluminium foil to the outside of a tarpaulin

To make a shield, fighters are told to smear a body-sized tarpaulin with glue, before covering it in standard supermarket bought aluminum foil. More glue is then added, and the shield if covered with an additional tarpaulin.

The shield can be further enhanced to offer protection during the day, the video explains, by painting it with camouflage colours, or by adding tree branches. It can also be easily folded up and carried.

According to Rt.com it is not known if the shield works or not, but the premise is simple enough: if the drone can't detect fighters, it can't kill them. 

The website quotes analysis from the Middle East Research Institute as saying: 'The aluminum is supposed to act like a heat barrier, keeping the fighter's body heat from being detected by the drone camera system.' 

A video showing fighters how to make the cloak, called 'Combatting Spy Airplanes', was put out by the terrorist group in the Arabian Peninsula and is 16 minutes long

The instruction video was largely complied from U.S. military public relations videos; drone attacks have been ongoing in Yemen for 13 years and have stepped-up by U.S. President Barack Obama

A spokesman for US Central Command, which runs military operations on the Arabian Peninsula, has reportedly refused to comment on the 'effectiveness or ineffectiveness of specific enemy [tactics].'

Drone strikes have been ongoing in Yemen for 13 years and a number of high ranking Al-Qaeda leaders have been killed as a result. 

Ali Qaed Senyan al-Harthi and five of his comrades were killed in November 2002 after a CIA Predator drone tracked their mobile phone signals. And Anwar al-Awlaki was killed in September 2011 by a Hellfire missile.

U.S. President Barack Obama has increased drone attacks in Yemen as the Arabian Peninsula group try and replicate the success of terrorists operating in Pakistan.
