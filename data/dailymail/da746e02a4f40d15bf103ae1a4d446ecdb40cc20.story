Arsenal let another lead slip as they fell to a 2-1 defeat by Swansea at the Liberty Stadium.

Alexis Sanchez gave the Gunners the lead with his sixth goal from his last four games before Gylfi Sigurdsson equalised with a precisely struck free-kick. 

Substitute Batefimbi Gomes completed an unlikely comeback within minutes of replacing Wilfried Bony to lift the Swans above their opponents in the Premier League table.

Gylfi Sigurdsson brought the Swans back into the game with a beautiful free kick

SWANSEA 

Lukasz Fabianski 6

Solid against his former club. Fine save to block Welbeck at his near post at the end of the first half. 

Angel Rangel 6

Penned back for much of the match and suffered the embarrassment of a second-half foul throw. 

Swansea captain Ashley Williams (R) stretches out in a rare foray up field for the defender

Kyle Bartley 6

Given a rare start because of Swansea’s injury problems but reasonably comfortable for most of the match. 

Ashley Williams 6.5

Hurt himself in fouling Cazorla shortly after the break and booked in the process. Not his best game from a technical perspective but a fine leader in a scrappy game. 

Neil Taylor 6

Booked for late sliding tackle on Oxlade-Chamberlain in first half, but improved as game went on. 

Ki Sung-yeung almost opened the scoring for Swansea with a first-half header

Ki Sung-yeung 6

Booked for clipping Oxlade-Chamberlain but, along with Carroll, struggled to get a grip on midfield. 

Tom Carroll 5.5

Deputising for the suspended Jonjo Shelvey and injured Leon Britton. Tidy passing as usual but unable to control the middle of the pitch. Booked. 

Marvin Emnes 6

Strong in a physical game and occasionally threatening with his runs, but Arsenal offered little space in which he could operate. Replaced by Barrow. 

Man of the match Jefferson Montero (centre) created problems for Arsenal throughout the game

Gylfi Sigurdsson 7

Lacked the service from midfield to have his usual creative impact, but turned the match with a stunning free-kick to equalise. Booked. 

Jefferson Montero 8.5 *MAN OF THE MATCH*

One of the fastest players in the division and had plenty of success running at Calum Chambers. Beat the Arsenal full back en route to setting up Swansea’s second.

Wilfried Bony 6

Unlucky not to win a penalty in first half. Usual presence in both areas and set up good chance for Emnes in first half, but scuffed a close range opportunity shortly after Swansea went behind.

Substitute Bafetimbi Gomis scores the match winning goal within minutes of replacing Wilfried Gomis 

Subs: Modou Barrow for Emnes (67, 6.5). Booked.

Bafetimbi Gomis for Bony 76.

Leon Britton for Carroll 87.

ARSENAL

Wojciech Szczesny 6

Little to do yet beaten twice. Nothing he could do about either.  

Calum Chambers 4.5

Lucky to get away with bundling over Bony in the area in first half, but booked after the break. A tired performance, typified by the way he was beaten by Montero on the way to Swansea’s second. 

Calum Chambers (left) struggled to cope with Jefferson Montero's pace ahead of Swansea's winner

Per Mertesacker 6.5

Booked for a clumsy second-half foul on Emnes. Generally solid and perhaps the best of Arsenal’s defenders. 

Nacho Monreal 5.5

Gave Gomis far too much space in the box in the move that led to the substitute getting Swansea’s second. 

Kieran Gibbs 6

Got forward well and largely untroubled at the back. Booked for cynical foul from behind to stop Barrow, from which Sigurdsson levelled with a free-kick. 

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (right) was Arsenal's standout player with an influential midfield performance

Aaron Ramsey 6.5

Given a stern reminder of his defensive duties by Wenger before the game but what a threat going forward. Excellent first half volley went close. Booked for a foul on Taylor. 

Mathieu Flamini 6

Booked in the second half for fouling Montero. Controlled midfield for two thirds of the game. 

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain 7.5

Drew two bookings in first half alone. Clearly had Swansea scared and for long spells was the brightest player on the pitch. In riding Carroll’s foul, he was key to Alexis Sanchez’s opener. 

Sanchez was back on the scoresheet to continue his hot streak but couldn't prevent defeat

Alexis Sanchez 7

Quiet but effective when he needed to be. Danny Welbeck did much of the hard work for the goal but a good run and clinical finish. Twelve goals in 14 games 

Santi Cazorla 6

Had a role in Arsenal’s goal but generally this was not a game when creative players excelled. 

Danny Welbeck 6.5

Went clear in 44th minute but shot too close to Fabianski. Improved significantly in the second half and set up Sanchez’s goal after beating Williams. 

Danny Welbeck picked out Sanchez to claim an assist for Arsenal's opening goal

Subs: Theo Walcott for Ramsey, 79.

Jack Wilshere for Flamini, 79

Yaya Sanogo for Chambers 90.

MOM: Jefferson Montero 

Ref: Phil Dowd 5. Waved away a strong penalty appeal and gave out a stunning number of yellow cards
