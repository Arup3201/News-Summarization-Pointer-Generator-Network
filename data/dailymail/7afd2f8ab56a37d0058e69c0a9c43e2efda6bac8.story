The parents of a teenager responsible for the high-speed car crash that killed four of his friends are facing jail for letting him drive their car.

Aaditia and Patricia Beer, of Queens, New York, 
allowed their son Joseph to drive their 2012 Subaru on October 8 even 
though he only had a learner's permit, prosecutors say.

Joseph Beer, 17, who was in court on Friday, was high on marijuana and going more than 110mph on the Southern State Parkway, Long Island, when he lost control and crashed into the woods around 4am.

The Richmond Hills High School student was the only survivor while his passengers - Chris Khan, Peter Kanhai and Darian Ramnarine, all 18, and Neal Rajapa, 17 - were killed in the crash.

All of the passengers were flung from the car. Joseph was taken to a hospital for minor injuries.

Aaditia and Patricia Beer were charged with unlicensed operation of a vehicle and face up to 15 days in jail and a $300 fine, MyFoxNY.com reported.

Joseph Beer faces 25 years in prison for aggravated vehicular homicide, vehicular manslaughter, four counts of manslaughter, driving under the influence, and unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle.

Supreme Court Justice David Ayres kept Beer handcuffed during his appearance and doubled the bail requested by prosecutors to $1million cash or $2million bond.

Tragic: Chris Khan, Peter Kanhai and Darian Ramnarine, all 18, and Neal Rajapa, 17, were killed in the crash

Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice said on Friday: 'The sheer magnitude of this tragedy is unthinkable, and it could have easily been avoided if this defendant had simply made the right choice to drive sober and drive safely.

'Instead, we have four promising young lives cut short, another young man facing years in prison, and families that will forever be torn apart by this horrific crash.'
