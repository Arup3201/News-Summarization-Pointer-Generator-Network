A beach in San Francisco contains five times the safe levels of radiation fueling concerns that Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant’s crisis is impacting areas across the country.

It comes just days after radiation readings were found to be double the normal amount in Missouri's recent snowfall.

According to YouTube user, DutchSinse, who posted a video of him taking the Geiger readings in St Louis, the findings mean that ‘small particles of radioactive material are indeed coming down in the precipitation. Past tests show around 30CPM in the same spot on a nice day with no precipitation’.

He said snowstorms in 2012 also showed alert level radiation readings.

The San Francisco findings prompted federal officials to launch an investigation, according to Infowars.com.

Health officials in San Mateo County confirmed the spike – which was reaching over 150 micro-REM per hour - but said they were ‘befuddled’ about what had caused it. 

A video shows a man measuring radiation readings at different spots on the beach south of Pillar Point Harbor.

Background radiation in the areas immediately surrounding the beach are normal, but once the man approaches the water itself, the radiation spikes to at least 500 per cent safe levels and the Geiger counter’s alarm goes off.

The man behind the video claims that on his previous visit to the same beach, radiation readings were 13 times the safe level.

Officials have dismissed the possibility that it could be linked to Fukushima radiation reaching the west coast, despite forecasts by experts last summer that radioactive particles from Fukushima would reach U.S. coastal waters in 2014.

Last week RT reported that new plumes of radioactive steam were emerging from the crippled reactor number 3 at the plant, but TEPCO representatives refused to explain the cause.

The Department of Health and Human Services has ordered 14 million doses of potassium iodide, the compound that protects the body from radioactive poisoning in the aftermath of severe nuclear accidents, but a DHHS official denied that the purchase was connected to the Fukushima crisis.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state Department of Public Health are investigating the cause of the radiation on the San Francisco beach. More information is expected to be released this week.

TEPCO and the Japanese government have repeatedly been caught lying in their efforts to downplay the scale of the Fukushima disaster.

In September, a BBC report said that radiation readings around the power plant were 18 times higher than previously reported by TEPCO.

And after a tank leaked 300 tonnes of toxic water in August, groundwater radiation readings at the plant soared to 400,000 becquerels per litre, the highest reading since the nuclear accident occurred in March 2011.
