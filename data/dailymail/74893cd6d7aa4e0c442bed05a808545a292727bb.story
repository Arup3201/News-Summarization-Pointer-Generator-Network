A violent boyfriend today admitted killing his former partner and her seven-month-old baby by 'strangling them in their beds' just two days after the couple had broken up.

Wesley Williams, 28, killed Yvonne Walsh and her son Harrison at her home in Billesley, Birmingham, West Midlands, in June this year - just days after the pair had separated.

University graduate Yvonne, 25, and Williams had been in a relationship for several months - but it ended abruptly on May 31.

Two days later the mother and baby were found dead in their beds after West Midlands Police forced their way into the property.

Post mortem examinations revealed the mother and son had died as a result of pressure being applied to their necks.

Williams today admitted two counts of murder during an emotional hearing at Birmingham Crown Court.

He was remanded in custody until sentencing next week on a date to be decided.

Williams, wearing a grey sweatshirt, spoke only to enter his guilty pleas to the two counts.

Judge William Davis QC told Williams he would be jailed for life and warned him to expect 'a very substantial term' in prison when he is sentenced next week.

Mr Davis also told Williams and 
members of the victims’ families sitting in the public gallery that 
although pleas had been taken, the case could not be dealt with today 
because of another separate trial over which he was already presiding.

Addressing
Williams, Judge Davis said: 'Self-evidently, because of your pleas, the
sentencing judge will be obliged to sentence you to prison for life and
the minimum period will be a very substantial term.'

Both the victims died as a result of pressure to the neck, according to a post mortem examination after they were found at their home in Chells Grove on June 2.

He was arrested the same day, shortly after the discovery of their remains by police.

Judge Davis QC ordered Williams to be remanded in custody until his sentencing hearing.

Two hours before Williams appeared in court Yvonne’s sister Tracey Walsh took to Facebook to plead with him to admit the killings.

She wrote: 'You’d think after six months this would get easier but still feels like the first day...plead guilty today you monster and let us get justice for our sister and nephew.'

Yvonne worked at a care home for vulnerable adults in Moseley, Birmingham, less than three miles from her home.

She had been seeing Williams for around two months after she split from Harrison’s biological father.

Detective Chief Inspector Sarbjit Johal,
from the homicide investigation team, today said: 'Wesley Williams has 
pleaded guilty to the shocking and senseless murders of his partner 
Yvonne and her baby Harrison who both had their whole lives ahead of 
them.

'Yvonne’s family 
described her as a warm and loving person who was a dedicated 
professional and absolutely devoted to her two young children.

'My
thoughts are with their family, friends and the community that they 
lived in who are all still struggling to come to terms with their 
deaths.'
