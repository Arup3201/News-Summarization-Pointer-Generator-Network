A police force attempting to highlight the kind of reports they get in a 12 hour period by live-tweeting each 999 call received their first incident from someone who had forgotten where they had parked.

Officers from the Metropolitan Police covering the east London borough of Havering have been posting the calls they received today on Twitter using the hashtag #MPSHaveringLive. 

At around 9am this morning they were called by a woman in the Hornchurch area who was attempting to report her vehicle missing - but later realised she had parked it on another street.

The force tweeted: 'Call 1: Caller wishes to cancel report made re. stolen motor vehicle.

'Vehicle was parked in a different street.' 

Officers later added that the call was made via the non-emergency 101 number and the incident was closed without police attending.

As the day went on other incidents included a report of a theft from a van overnight but 'nothing was taken' and reports of a panic alarm going off in a shop, but it turned out to be an error.

The first call to the force was from a woman who was calling to report her car had been stolen - but she later found in a different street. It was among the many reports received by Havering police today

Another call was from someone who believed they had had items stolen from their van overnight but police found nothing had been taken

Another call was from about a panic alarm being set off in a shop in Hornchurch, but it turned out be a false alarm. Police have been using the hash tag #MPSHaveringLive on Twitter today

More serious calls were taken such as one caller who had been contacted by a company claiming to be a PPI firm and needed a £5,000 admin fee.

A pensioner also received a call from a 'bogus police officer, asking for credit card details'.

Meanwhile, officers on foot stopped a male in possession of cannabis around 7pm, who was taken into custody, and dealt with a road rage incident during the evening rush hour in Hornchurch.

Havering Police, which began tweeting at 9am and rounded off at 9pm, said: 'The idea is to give the public a glimpse of what we deal with on a daily basis.'

The force did take some more serious calls including one from a caller who needed assistance from police to attend an ex-partner's house with them to collect property

Twitter users have been getting in touch with the force with their feedback on the initiative, saying they have found it 'surprising', 'good' and 'interesting'.

Greater Manchester Police trialled the scheme in 2010 after the chief constable - Sir Peter Fahy - decided to give a 'day-in-the-life' account of what goes on in the force and show how overstretched they are.

Posts ranged from an alleged rape and a man threatening to kill someone to such ‘emergencies’ as a horse refusing to cross a bridge and a woman complaining that someone had shouted ‘You’re gorgeous!’ at her.

But at the time the public was left wondering how, if officers were so overburdened, time could be found to post over 1,000 incidents online. 

To make matters worse the stunt, by the country’s third largest force, was exploited by pranksters posting spoof incidents.

One read: ‘Prank call from City of Manchester stadium [Manchester City’s ground]. Reported missing trophies. Not to be taken seriously.’ 

Havering Police took 26 calls over the 12 hour period and has asked Twitter users whether they would like to see it happen again.
