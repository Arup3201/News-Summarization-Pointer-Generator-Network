A bikie who opened fire in a  shopping centre and injured an innocent bystander has been sentenced to 12 years and three months in jail.

Mongols member Mark James Graham, 28, was sentenced on Monday for the attempted murder of rival Bandidos member Jacques Teamo at the Robina Town Centre on the Gold Coast on April 28, 2012.

Graham was also sentenced for unlawfully wounding bystander Kathy Devitt, who was hit in the buttock by one of two bullets.

On the day in question, an innocent passerby picked up a $10 note that a fellow shopper had dropped and handed it back to the owner.

The Good Samaritan was oblivious that the person was Graham - who had just pulled out a gun from his bum bag, The Courier Mail reported.

Graham, whose cleanly-shaven head showed his tattoos on his skull, was somewhat expressionless during the sentencing at the Supreme Court in Brisbane.

In sentencing, Supreme Court Justice Alan Wilson said it was inconceivable that any prior conflict or vendetta between Graham and Teamo could justify Graham's 'brazen contempt' for public safety.

'What you did there with that weapon shattered the peace of a place in which citizens generally feel safe as they go about their leisurely business,' Justice Wilson told the heavily-tattooed bikie in the dock.

'Your conduct exposed a large number of people to a real and present - and also alien and entirely unexpected - danger.'

Justice Wilson said it 'remained a mystery' that Mr Teamo was armed with a knife, and Graham with a handgun, to both go on a shopping trip with their families.

'When you saw each other, neither the presence of family nor of large numbers of innocent bystanders, discouraged you from a confrontation which resulted in Teamo and Ms Kathy Devitt, a person unknown to you, being shot,' he said The Courier Mail reported.

It will be almost 10 years before Graham is eligible for parole after he was declared a serious violent offender, which means he must serve at least 80 per cent of his sentence behind bars.

His defence barrister Anthony Kimmins told the sentencing hearing his client wrote a letter to Ms Devitt and arranged to pay her $10,000 compensation, actions that showed 'genuine remorse'.

Justice Wilson shaved 21 months off the 14-year sentence he originally intended to give Graham, but said that was due to the amount of time the father of one spent in jail awaiting sentence.

The court heard Ms Devitt was still psychologically affected by the incident and that some bullet residue remained in her wound.

Teamo, who had brandished a knife during the confrontation, walked away with only minor injuries to his shoulder.

Justice Wilson said it was only down to good luck that other bystanders weren't wounded.

Graham's lawyer had argued at an earlier sentencing hearing that his client had acted in self-defence.

However, Justice Wilson said even if that was true, the jury in Graham's trial had been entitled to find the tattooist's reaction was 'grossly disproportionate' and 'abhorrent'.
