A 'vulnerable' young girl questioned by police investigating the Rochdale child sex ring has lifted the lid on a second gang operating in the area, it emerged last night.

The teenager has told officers she was abused by a different group of men from the nine  jailed last week over the sexual exploitation of girls as young as 13.

Her claims have led to the arrest of nine men, aged between 24 and 38, all from Rochdale, on suspicion of sexual activity with a child.

The first Oldham scandal: Eight of the nine men who were jailed this week following an investigation into what police say appears to be an entirely separate sex grooming ring. The ninth man cannot be identified for legal reasons

Shockwaves: Police guard Liverpool Crown Court during the trial in which nine men from Rochdale were jailed for grooming underage girls for sex. Just a few days later, officers believe they have arrested members of a second ring

Judge Gerald Clifton: Condemned the first gang jailed last week and suggested they deliberately targeted girls outside their community

Concern: Rochdale's Labour MP Simon Danczuk says he fears last week's conviction was not a one-off case and that sexual exploitation is a wider issue in the Greater Manchester area

Greater Manchester Police said the 
latest claims relate to abuse which is alleged to have taken place over a
 six-year period, beginning in 2005.

The men are thought to be from Asian and Afro-Caribbean backgrounds.

They are not believed to know one another or those convicted in the previous case.

Police sources have described the girl, who told officers she knew the men by their nicknames only, as ‘extremely vulnerable’.

It is understood officers have carried
 out sensitive video interviews with the girl, who is believed to be one
 of 47 identified by police investigating the original case as a victim 
of sexual abuse.

Last Wednesday nine Asian men received jail sentences of between four and 19 years

after being convicted of repeatedly abusing five white girls, aged between 13 and 15, in 2008 and 2009.

The convictions marked the conclusion 
of one of the largest investigations into child sexual exploitation ever
 undertaken in Britain.

Liverpool Crown Court was told that 
the girls would receive food, money and alcohol but were repeatedly 
raped and sexually assaulted in return.

The men were convicted of conspiracy 
to engage in sexual activity with children under the age of 16 and other
 sexual offences including rape and trafficking for sexual exploitation.

The case has sparked a national debate
 over whether religion and culture played a role in the Pakistani and 
Afghani men’s targeting of vulnerable white girls.

The judge, Gerald Clifton, suggested the men targeted their victims because they were ‘not of your community or religion’.

But police and political leaders have 
denied the crimes were about race – insisting the men had targeted the 
girls simply because they were vulnerable.

A Greater Manchester Police spokesman 
said of the latest arrests: ‘In total nine men have been arrested aged 
between 24 and 38 years old, on suspicion of sexual activity with a 
child.

‘They have been bailed pending further inquiries.’

A file of evidence on the latest arrests is expected to be handed over to the Crown Prosecution Service within a few weeks.

One senior detective said: ‘Inquiries
 are continuing. Just because the trial has finished and nine men have 
been convicted does not mean the operation has stopped.

'We are continuing to chip away, gaining the confidence of the girls.’
