On her 19th birthday, Amy Pejkovic received the earth-shattering news that she had a tumour on her brain stem.

Now 21, the champion high jumper and model has made a remarkable recovery, and she is training hard for the Rio De Janeiro Olympics in 2016 after fighting her way back to the number two ranking in Australia.

In February 2012 Miss Pejkovic, from Turramurra on Sydney's North Shore, was gearing up for the London Olympics, but her preparations were complicated by the fact she was suffering excruciating headaches, dizziness and was vomiting every day.

Despite multiple doctors diagnosing her with a middle ear infection her mother and coach Leanne Pejkovic's instincts told her it was something else.

After feeling sick during her 19th birthday party she was taken to hospital and where she described her symptoms to a nurse who sent her for an MRI straight away.

It was then that he found out she had a baseball-sized brain tumour.

'I was quite scared… Extremely frightened,' Miss Pejkovic told Daily Mail Australia.

'I never thought that something like that would ever happen to me and when it did the first thing I thought was "Am I going to die?"

'I thought I was potentially going to be dead in the next few weeks.'

The position of the tumour meant it was blocking fluid from her brain so she had to be admitted to the intensive care unit, and doctors did not know whether the tumour was benign or malignant.

After the operation to remove the tumour from the back of her head Miss Pejkovic received her first piece of good news – the operation had gone smoothly and the tumour was benign.

But the illness had taken its toll – her weight and muscle mass had dropped dramatically and she was too weak to even sit up in bed.

'I lost 10kg in two weeks, I was just skin and bone, it was horrible,' she said.

'Day by day I'd start to sit up until I felt sick and then I'd just lie back down.

'The physio would come in and try to get me to swing my legs off the bed.'

Miss Pejkovic had to get the strength to walk again with the help of a walking frame.

She had intended to start university that year but put those plans on hold so she could rest and get her strength back.

'I kind of just let myself rest and go on walks and go to training sometimes, but training would consist of walking around the oval once,' she said.

'I started jogging then slowly started doing the drills everyone else was doing.'

At the same time she also did a number of modelling jobs.

'Every time they'd  go to do my hair they pull it up and go wait, hold up, why is there a massive strip missing?' Miss Pejkovic said.

'I loved looking at the reactions on their faces when they saw the massive bald patch on my head.'

After being back at athletics training for months she felt like she would never be able to get back to her previous standard.

That is, until January this year, when she equalled her personal best jump of 186cm at a competition Canberra.

'It took a while for me to realise I was back in it… I think it kind of really hit me in Canberra,' she said.

'It was amazing. I started crying actually.'

But Miss Pejkovic realised she was definitely back in the game in February, when she beat that record and jumped 187cm at the Queensland State Championships.

'That was the first time I've jumped a personal best in four years,' she said.

'That was quite exciting.'

At the same time her modelling career has been taking off, with Miss Pejkovic walking in three shows at Fashion Week in Sydney this year including Talulah and Bec and Bridge.

She said her recovery has completely changed the way she looks at life

She also has a 'big' campaign for a major sportswear label coming out in October, which she is unable to talk about in detail.

Miss Pejkovic is not sure whether she enjoys athletics or modelling more and for now she wants to pursue them both.

'I just sort of balance both of them because they go hand in hand. Even though there are not many models that are also elite athletes,' she said.

'A lot of clients find it quite interesting… They like the fact there's a story behind it.'

She is also doing a university bridging course and is hoping to start studying a journalism degree next year.

Miss Pejkovic said finding out she had a tumour and making her recovery has completely changed the way she looks at life.

'Before I would take things for granted and I was quite lazy, even though I was training I was lazy about a few things, but now I'm so driven,' she said.

'I definitely don't take anything for granted anymore, I just try and appreciate absolutely everything.

'I know it sounds cliché but it's true that life is short and you do only live once so you've got to focus on what you want and chase your dreams.'
