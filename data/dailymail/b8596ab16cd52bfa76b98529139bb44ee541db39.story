The breast implants at the centre of a health scare involving thousands of British women contained a ‘near criminal’ mix of chemicals including a fuel additive, it emerged today.

Scientists in France carried out an extensive examination of the ‘secret formula’ used by Poly Implant Prothese (PIP), which went into liquidation last year.

Up to 50,000 women in the UK, including breast cancer survivors, have the implants, which until now were thought to be filled with gel meant for mattresses.

In fact, chemists commissioned by RTL, the Paris radio station, found a range of potentially hugely harmful components including Baysilone, Silopren and Rhodorsil.

Baysilone is used as a fuel additive, while Silopren and Rhodorsil are mainly used in the production of rubber tubing.

‘On the menu, a mixture of products used by industrial companies that have never been clinically tested for their possible harmful effects on the body,’ said a spokesman for RTL, adding: ‘They include a fuel additive’.

The spokesman said that Jean-Claude Mas, the 72-year-old founder of PIP who is facing manslaughter charges in France, put all the chemicals together as a part of a ‘secret formula’.

It enabled him to sell the implants at a vast discount, so enabling him to become a multi-millionaire.

‘When the chemicals were all mixed with each other, the illusion was complete,’ said the RTL spokesman.

‘All are products unknown to the medical world,’ said toxicologist Andre Picot, who carried out research for RTL, adding the mix was ‘on the verge of criminal’.

Philippe Courtois, a lawyer acting for women caught up in the scandal in France, said: ‘We could not believe that the gel could contain a fuel additive.’

Mr Courtois said health authorities across the world, including the NHS, should have ordered a detailed analysis of the gel as soon as women started to complain of feeling ill because of them.

Figures show that PIP implants have an 8 per cent chance of rupture – eight times higher than claimed over the last fortnight by the UK’s medical safety watchdog.

Some victims say private clinics are demanding up to £3,000 to remove the implants. The clinics argue that they bought the implants in good faith and would face financial ruin if they had to remove them free of charge.

Health Secretary Andrew Lansley has ordered an urgent review of the safety of the PIP implants and has promised that if there are concerns the Government will ‘act with whatever remedy required’.

He hopes to publish the review’s findings within days, and industry experts expect him to follow France in advising all women with PIP implants to have them taken out.

With each operation costing up to £3,000, the total sum involved could reach £150million.

Leaks of silicone from the implants can cause agonising pain, as well as swelling and lumps in the breast and armpit, some of which can be easily mistaken by women for tumours, causing unnecessary anxiety.

There are also fears that the PIP implants, which were among the cheapest on the market, raise the risk of cancer.

Mas denies any wrong-doing, claiming that his implants were all completely safe.
