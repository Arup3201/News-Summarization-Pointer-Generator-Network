Anger: Emma Townsend, 23, was sent a text message from mobile phone company Orange reading 'You are sooo pathetic' in a row over a £110 unpaid bill

Mobile phone giant Orange sent a young mother a text message reading 'You are sooo pathetic' in a row over a £110 unpaid bill.

Emma Townsend, 23, was shocked when she read the message, which was sent directly to her mobile after her boyfriend Carwyn Davis called to complain about an unexpectedly high bill.

The mother-of-one from Stroud, Gloucestershire, is now demanding a formal apology from Orange, now part of EE, after she was sent the poorly-worded text which read: 'You are so pathetic you can't pay your bill and you blame it other people. You are sooo PATHETIC'.

Ms Townsend said: 'I am shocked and very upset with Orange.

'The text I received was awful. I was out for lunch with my mother when my phone buzzed with a text from Orange.

'When
 I read it, I was in shock. I could not believe someone would send me an
 abusive text like that, especially when they are meant to be there to 
help.

'It was borderline bullying and it is disgusting.'

Ms
 Townsend and Mr Davis, 24, have a joint account with Orange, which is 
in her name, and they pay for their mobile phone bill by direct debit 
each month.

However, in April the pair received an unexpectedly high bill for £110.

Mr Davis called EE customer services and was told there had been a problem with the direct debit in March, resulting in the payment not being made and so it had been rolled over into April.

'They told us we had missed a month, even though we have a direct debit, but we received a really high bill in April, which was a shock,' he said.

The car salesman added: 'We did not understand how the bill had shot up without them telling us, so we rang Orange.

'We were told Emma should have rung up and paid the bill over the phone. But as we had the direct debit we assumed it would have been paid.'

Ms Townsend said: 'Because of the high bill, we have had to forfeit other things and it has really messed up our finances.

'And then for someone to send me a text with abuse afterwards is just out of order.'

After the couple had queried the bill, Ms Townsend received an automated text asking for rating on customer service.

'We were so unimpressed that we responded with "one out of 10" to every question,' said Mr Davis.

The following day Emma received the abusive text.

'We just couldn't believe it. It was a despicable thing to send to Emma and it really upset her,' Mr Davis said.

'I called up Orange straight away and the employee apologised on behalf of the colleague who had sent the text and I was told it would be dealt with.'

Mr Davis said he has been chasing Orange every week for an apology, but according to the couple they are yet to hear from the company.

'It has been weeks now and I've heard nothing,' said Ms Townsend, who works for supermarket chain Morrisons.

'No-one should receive a text like that, let alone from a big professional company. It is just not good enough.'

The couple, who are parents to a 21-month-old son, Harley, say they are appalled with Orange.

'I feel like this has not been taken seriously at all. It is disgusting that they haven't bothered to ring Emma to apologise,' Mr Davis said.

'Even just a supervisor or manager calling to let me know that they have acknowledged the matter and are taking it seriously would be enough at this point.'

He added: 'Our contract doesn't finish until September so basically we're drawn in until then.

'I don't want to carry on giving them our business after all of this. I think they need to do more to apologise as it was serious bullying behavior.

'We are still waiting for a formal apology.'

Orange said it was taking the matter 'very seriously' and would be addressing it 'as a priority'.

A spokesman said: 'We apologise unreservedly to Ms Townsend for the text received. We are investigating this and will take appropriate action.'
