When the climate turns icy, gritters are generally there to prevent accidents.

However this particular gritting lorry became a casualty of the roads when it overturned while out performing road safety duties this morning.

The 23-year-old driver had to be freed by fire crews after his 20-tonne vehicle crashed into the gable end of a house in Broad Lane in Rochdale.

Firefighters had to cut away part of the vehicle's roof and the driver was taken into hospital.

Accident: The driver of a gritting lorry had to be freed after it crashed and overturned

Injuries: The driver was taken to the Royal Oldham Hospital with cuts on his face and an arm injury

A family were in bed in the house when the crash happened at the road's junction with Waddington Fold just after 6am today.

Up to 20 firefighters including members of a specialist rescue unit, were called to the scene, along with police and paramedics.

Watch manager Thomas Hague, from Rochdale Fire Station, said: 'We discovered a gritting lorry on its side and a man trapped between the road and the cab section of the lorry.

'We stabilised the vehicle then cut off the roof.

'In consultation with the ambulance service, we got the man out through the roof. He had injuries to his arm but he was conscious and breathing.

'The lorry had collided with a detached house causing slight damage to the gable end of the house.

'The people inside the house were asleep at the time and reported hearing a loud bang, but no one was injured.

'Crews on the scene assessed the damage and deemed that no further action was necessary by the fire service.'

Clean up: Fire crews and rescue units prepare to clean up following the accident

The driver was taken to the Royal Oldham Hospital with cuts on his face and an arm injury.

It is thought the Mercedes gritter was heading downhill towards Rochdale town centre when the crash happened on a bend.

Gritting trucks have been out in force across Greater Manchester overnight after temperatures plummeted below zero and caused ice to form.

The lorry could be seen on its side this morning and grit was strewn across the pavement next to the smashed up garden wall of a house.

Rochdale council say the truck belongs to its contractor Balfour Beatty, who grit the roads on behalf of the council, and the driver is an employee of the firm.

A Rochdale Council spokesman said: 'We're very sorry to hear of the accident and our thoughts at the moment are with the driver and his family. We send our best to him.

'He was doing an important job trying to keep the roads gritted so that they would be safer for everyone to use.'
