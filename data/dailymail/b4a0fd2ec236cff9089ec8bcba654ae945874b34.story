It's set to be one of the most expensive domain names ever sold, and tonight as holiday.com goes to auction, the travel industry prepares to hail a new giant. 

Bidding began on Monday for the auction, which starts at 5.30pm at the luxurious Sunborn London hotel, as part of the World Travel Market industry fair at London Excel, in Newham.

And experts say it could surpass the current top seller, insurance.com, which sold for £21.5million in 2010.

Big bucks: Holiday.com is expected to be one of the most expensive domain name ever sold 

Its owners, luxury concierge service provider Breathe Luxury Ltd, call the name 'the Holy Grail' of the travel industry, and 'holiday' is one of the most popular search terms on the internet, making it a very desirable prospect.

More than 90 per cent of travel companies already have the phrase as one of their top five key words for reaching customers through online search. 

Many attempts have been made to buy holiday.com over the past 16 years, with major travel companies battling for ownership in order to increase their market share - but it is only now that the owners are at ease to part with it. 

A spokesman for Breathe Luxury Ltd said: 'Holiday.com is clearly a world record breaker in the making.'

Insurance.com £21.5 million

VacationRentals.com £21.1million

PrivateJet.com £18.2million

Internet.com £10.9million

Insure.com £9.7million

Sex.com for £8.4million

Hotels.com £6.6million

Fund.com £6 million

Porn.com £5.7million

Fb.com by Facebook £5.1 million

Business.com for £4.5 million 

A spokesman for Breathe Luxury Ltd said: 'Holiday.com is clearly a world record breaker in the making.'

'Here at Breathe Luxury we believe that Holiday.com has all the hallmarks to be the No.1 leading travel brand and dedicated online platform in serving holidaymakers worldwide.' 

Richard Winslow, head of hosting, Host Europe Group, warned that while a memorable keyword such as 'holiday', is valuable for companies, they must have an effective plan, too.

'You need to have a business plan and to be able to use the name and market it effectively,' he told the Guardian.

If it does sell as well as is expected, holiday.com as a domain name on its own could outstrip the sales of insurance.com, vacationrentals.com which went for £21million and privatejet.com, sold for £18million – all of which included the transfer of ownership of a complete business.

According to Business Insider, sex.com still holds the Guinness World Record for the most expensive domain name-only sale – around £8million in 2010.
