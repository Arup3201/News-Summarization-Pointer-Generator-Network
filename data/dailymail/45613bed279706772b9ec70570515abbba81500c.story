Grumpy Cat, there's a new sourpuss in town. 

But Sauerkraut the cat can't help looking like she is disapproving of your very existence - she was born that way. 

Rescued from an animal shelter and adopted by Amy and Patrick Bender, two-year-old Sauerkraut may look disgruntled, but she is in very loving hands.

Cat's amazing: Sauerkraut now has 28,000 Instagram followers

What you looking at? Sauerkraut's permanent frown is caused by a neurological condition

Wistful: One of Sauerkraut's favorite hobbies is looking out of the window - even though she looks like she hates every minute of it

Amy, from Oklahoma, explains: 'When Sauerkraut came to us as a foster, it was clear early on that she had some neurological problems. 

'But she now weighs about 5.5 pounds and is fully grown. Many people are surprised at her tiny size. She is full grown and has enough attitude for three normal sized cats. 

'Sauerkraut does not mind travelling in cars and loves looking out the window and watching the traffic roll by. She is harness trained and also enjoys riding in her stroller.'

Sauerkraut's fame is growing fast. 

She now has 28,000 Instagram followers and the Benders are taking her to several cat shows this summer, including the prestigious 'CatCon' in Los Angeles, according to News9.com.
