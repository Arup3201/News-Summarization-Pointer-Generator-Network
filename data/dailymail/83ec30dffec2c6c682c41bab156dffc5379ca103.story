Legendary slugger Jose Canseco was injured in an accidental shooting at his Las Vegas, Nevada home Tuesday afternoon.

The 50-year-old's fiancée Leila Knight told TMZ that he was at their home, cleaning his gun when it unexpectedly fired and blew off his left-hand middle finger. She says Canseco was not aware it was loaded.

Metro Police confirm that a person was injured at the address and taken to the hospital for non-life-threatening injuries around 3pm.

As of Tuesday night around 10pm ET, Canseco was in surgery to reattach the finger. 

Doctors allegedly told the couple that Canseco will never regain full use of the finger, no matter if they are able to reattach what's left.   

Records show that Canseco owns the home where the alleged incident occurred. 

The Cuban-American dominated the MLB with his hitting prowess in the 1980s, but later admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs for much of his career. 

Canseco is a right-handed batter who hit 462 career home runs and was a six-time All-Star. 

He also played for Texas, Boston, Toronto, Tampa Bay, the New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox during a career that spanned from 1985 to 2001.
