Murder-trial mother Lacey Spears, who is accused of poisoning her son with salt, smiled when a doctor told her his blood tests showed high levels of sodium, a court has heard.

Dr Sarika Sunku, a pediatrician who treated Garnett Spears at Nyack Hospital, New York, made the disturbing claim on the eighth day of testimony at his mother's trial.

A tireless blogger who documented her son's health problems, Spears is accused of researching, planning and carrying out her son's poisoning, then trying to cover up her role in his death. 

Horrific: Lacey Spears wept as a court watched video last week of what prosecutors allege shows her 5-year-old son Garrett writhing and screaming in pain after she injected him with a fatal dose of salt

Poignant: Spears is seen here with her son Garnett. Video shown in court allegedly shows her taking him from his bed to a bathroom where prosecutors say she used his stomach feeding tube to inject him with salt

Dr Sunku's testimony came in the same week a second pediatrician told the court that Spears failed to follow up his advice that her son have tests that might have led to the removal of a feeding tube.

In testimony yesterday, Dr Ivan Darenkov said he repeatedly recommended a nutritional and feeding evaluation, the Journal News reported. 

'Did she ever follow up?' prosecutor Patricia Murphy asked.

'No,' Darenkov told Westchester County Court.

Defense lawyers pointed out that Spears never refused the evaluation. She had a follow-up appointment scheduled, which she and her son missed because the boy had already been admitted to Nyack Hospital, the defense said. 

It is at that hospital that Spears is accused of feeding Garnett, five, a lethal dose of salt through his stomach tube. She then calmly 'watched and waited' for the poisoning to take effect, according to the prosecution.

She only summoned help only after he began writhing and retching, the court was told. He died days later, in January last year, of high sodium levels that caused swelling of the brain.

Nyack Hospital pediatrician Dr Sunku, who took the witness stand on Tuesday, said Spears 'just had a smile on her face' when blood tests showed Garnett's sodium level had surged, the  Journal News earlier reported. 

Under cross-examination, Dr Sunku conceded that such an increase could be caused by water loss and did not necessarily mean he had been poisoned with salt.

But the insinuation was compounded by a friend of Spears who said she did not see the mother cry when Garnett had a seizure minutes after Spears allegedly administered a dose of salt.

Danielle Grossenbacher said Garnett had been 'healthy and happy' just five days before his death, 'jumping off the bed [and] running around the floor' in his hospital room. 

Then, on a second visit, Ms Grossenbacher said she walked into Garnett's room to find him surrounded by medics and the boy 'flailing all over the bed'.

She said Spears appeared 'scared but a little withdrawn' as her son suffered the seizure. 'I did not see her cry,' said Ms Grossenbacher.  

Mother and son: Spears is accused of killing five-year-old Garnett by feeding him salt through a stomach tube and then calmly 'watched and waited' for the poisoning to take effect, prosecutors said

Assistant District Attorney Doreen Lloyd earlier alleged Spears fed her son the salt in a hospital bathroom after he was admitted. The mother had told doctors he was having seizures.

'It seems to go against nature,' the prosecutor said. 'But Lacey Spears is not like most people.' She said Spears enjoyed the 'attention and sympathy' she received from having a sick child.

Spears, who moved to Scottsville, Kentucky, after her son's death, had documented Garnett's declining health on social media. She wiped away a tear as the prosecutor spoke.

Defense lawyer Stephen Riebling told the jurors there are no eyewitnesses and no direct evidence that the 27-year-old poisoned her son.

He added: 'There is no evidence in this case that legitimately answers the question "Why?"'  

Trial: Jurors watched video taken January 19, 2014 in which five hospital staffers surround Garrett as he flails around. There is no audio with the video, but prosecutors claim he was screaming in pain

Ms Lloyd told jurors they would see hospital video showing mother and son twice going into the bathroom and then see Garnett become ill soon afterward both times. He died of high sodium levels that caused swelling of the brain.

But the bathroom is out of the range of the camera, and Mr Riebling noted that no-one saw Spears feed her son salt.

Garnett's death ended a short life filled with doctor and hospital visits that his mother tirelessly documented in thousands of postings on Facebook, Twitter, MySpace and a blog.

Many of the postings will be in evidence, along with Spears' online research into the dangers of sodium in children and hospital records from New York, Florida and Spears' native Alabama.

Against the objections of defense lawyers, Ramapo police Sergeant John Lynch is today due to testify on the web pages Spears allegedly visited and read in prepartion for poisoning her son.

Also in evidence is a feeding bag prosecutors believe was used to hold the salt - and which they say she tried to hide after Garnett's death.

Defense attorneys have insisted that there will be no mention of Munchausen by proxy, a disorder in which caretakers secretly harm children to win sympathy. Some experts believe that disorder fits Spears' actions.

Spears denies charges of second-degree murder and first-degree manslaughter. The trial continues.
