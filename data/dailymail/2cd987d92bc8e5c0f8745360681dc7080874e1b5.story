Bill Gates has come under fire over an illegal 'horse-waste storage facility' on his $8.7 million horse farm

Microsoft mogul Bill Gates has been causing a bit of a stink among locals in the tiny equestrian town of Wellington, Florida.

The billionaire has come under fire over an illegal 'horse-waste storage facility' on his $8.7 million horse farm - and he's getting fined $250 a day  until he destroys it.

Town inspectors claim the livestock manure dump on Gates' sprawling property  is only 18.75 feet from a narrow pond, while Wellington's code mandates that it be at least 100 feet away. 

According to Page Six, the businessman - who is worth around $80 billion - has racked up $40,000 in daily fines so far.

A second code violation apparently relates to the businessman not having a proper permit for the storage bin in the first place.

Gates, who is known to donate millions to environmental projects throughout the world, bought the sprawling property in cash last year. 

But despite several warnings about the two code violations dating back to July 18, the businessman has still not had the manure dump moved.

The village of Wellington is known for its equestrian community and hosts more than 40 competitions a year, including the Winter Equestrian Festival - the largest horse show in the world.

Gates' teenage daughter, Jennifer, trains at the Wellington estate - which includes space for 20 horses, plus training grounds - and competes in horse shows nearby.

Wellington's Code Enforcement Manager, Steven Koch, confirmed to Page Six that Gates' manure bin was in the 'wrong area', 

But he added that after months of letters: 'We made contact with the contractor and the trustee today [Tuesday]. We don't know what triggered it.'

He said that the manure dump is now being removed, and local inspectors will make sure it has been properly disposed of before the property works with the Wellington Department of Buildings to build a new bin.

Gates' rep did not respond to Page Six's request for a comment.
