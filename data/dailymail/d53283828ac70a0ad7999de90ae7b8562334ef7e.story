Outnumbered but definitely not outgunned. Trainer Mark Bradstock should adopt it as his stable motto.

The Oxfordshire trainer will certainly be hoping that is the case when Coneygree bids to become the first novice to win the £550,000 Betfred Gold Cup since Captain Christy in 1974.

Talk of such lofty ambition started after Bradstock and his assistant trainer wife, Sara, saw Coneygree stroll home by 40 lengths in the Kauto Star Novices’ Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day in only his second steeplechase.

Proof the performance was not a fluke came when Coneygree slammed Hennessy Gold Cup runner-up Houblon Des Obeaux by seven lengths in Newbury’s Denman Chase on February 7.

Part of the credit for Coneygree’s performances has been shared with son Alfie. He is pursuing a showjumping career under the guidance of former international Graham Fletcher and regularly tutors Coneygree over the poles.

Bradstock, who spent 12 years as assistant to legendary trainer Fulke Walwyn, said: ‘Coneygree’s strength is an incredibly high cruising speed and being able to efficiently jump at that speed, when most can’t. 

'For a small stable like us to even have a runner at the Festival is fantastic, let alone a fancied one.

‘But I never feel like an underdog. We can put it up the bigger stables, even with their £250,000 horses, as 99 per cent of our horses are front-runners — they are fit and know how to jump.’
