A two-year-old boy has left his mother in a bind after getting his toy cordless drill stuck in her hair when he attempted to 'blow dry' it.

Fiona Pantazis, from Baulkham Hills in Sydney's north-west, was getting ready to head out with her two-year-old son Eli when he began to use his toy tools to help brush her hair.

'He began using his plastic saw to comb my hair and it was almost like a massage, and then I felt something move against my head and I just felt this heavy weight attached to my hair and pulling it down,' Mrs Pantazis told Daily Mail Australia.

'I just couldn't believe it, we were about to go out and I thought, "Oh good, now I have to go out with a drill stuck in my hair,' she said.

'I just had my hair all chopped off last week and thought I might have to head back and give them the very bizarre request of cutting a toy drill out of my hair.'

Mrs Pantazis, 28, is heavily pregnant with identical twin girls, and said that she couldn't even run after Eli to tell him off. 

'He's just turned two and keeps me on my toes. Handful is not even the word for it. He sees my blow-dry my hair every day and must have wanted to give it a go,' she said.

'I spent 15 minutes removing each strand of hair before my husband called and told me there was a reverse function on the drill,' she said.

Mrs Pantazis said she thinks Eli was trying to emulate her husband Bill, 36 (above right)

'I blame him and Bob the Builder for this.' 

Mrs Pantazis and her husband Bill, 36, are in the middle of building a house, and said that Eli has been trying to emulate the workers on the site. 

The toy tool box was a gift from Eli's grandparents for Christmas, which Mrs Pantazis said she initially thought was a great gift.

'Now I wish it had stayed in the shop,' she said. 

The Pantazis' are expecting twin girls in August and their house is due to be completed a month before that

'Eli was saying "pretty Mummy", and all I could think was "it's not pretty".

'He is so sweet and melts my heart every day with the littlest things, but for the rest of the day is just a little energetic boy.'

The Pantazis' twin girls are due in August, and their house is due to be finished only a month beforehand, which Mrs Pantazis said is 'putting pressure' on the situation.

'The cordless drill and saw and all the toy tools are disappearing before the girls come. I've learnt from my experience that they need to go before their hair starts growing,' she said.
