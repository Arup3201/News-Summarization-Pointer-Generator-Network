The solid gold engagement ring which Napoleon gave to his first wife Josephine has sold at auction for £660,000 - nearly 50 times its list price.

The historic jewellery went under the hammer at Osenat’s in central Paris yesterday and was bought by a mystery businessman.

The 18th Century ring contains two pear-shaped stones, a blue sapphire and a diamond, and each gem weights one carat.

The auction was held in honour of the 250th anniversary of the birth of Joséphine de Beauharnais, who become the Empress of France after marrying Napoleon Bonaparte.

Auction house spokeswoman Emily 
Villane said: 'Not in my wildest dreams did I think we would outsell the
estimate by more than 47 times.

'We based the estimates in our catalogue on the actual market value of the ring, minus the connection with Napoleon and Josephine.'

Around 300 people were at the auction house when the ring was sold, with approximately 50 bidders from around the world taking part over the phone.

The auctioneers set up additional phone lines and hired an extra 10 staff to cope with the demand.

It also received more than 40 written bids, sent by email to the auctioneers from the United States.

Ms Villane said the bidding was 'relentless', having opened at 10,000 euros and then being raised to 50,000 euros.

She added: 'From then on it was going up by 10,000. When the hammer went down at 730,000 euros there was huge applause.'

Unusually
for the time, Josephine was a widow with a son and a daughter when she 
married history’s most famous Frenchman on March 9, 1796.

Her
first husband, Alexandre, had been beheaded following the French 
Revolution and within a few years had become Napoleon's mistress.

She had been known as Rose until meeting the general, but adopted Josephine, the name Napoleon preferred to call her.

Napoleon left just days after the wedding to fight in Italy and wrote a series of love letters to his wife.

In one of the letters he said 
Josephine 'alone can move and rule' his heart, but such affection turned
to anger when news reached him of his wife's affair with Hussar 
lieutenant Hippolyte Charles.

Napoleon went on to have numerous 
affairs of his own and divorced Josephine in 1810 because she was unable
to have anymore children and the Emperor was determined to have an 
heir.

But the couple remained on good terms and Napoleon insisted his former wife retained the title of Empress.

Napoleon
married Marie-Louise of Austria, with whom he had a son, but locked 
himself in his room for two days, while in exile in Elba, when he heard 
of the death of Josephine from pneumonia in 1814.

Also sold at the auction was a sword 
given by Henry IV to Jean d'Harambure, known as 'Le Borgne' (The Blind),
which was valued at 40,000 euros.

Other
lots included a 250,000 euro painting of Napoleon's son, Napoleon II, 
Duke of Reichstadt, by 19th Century German-Austrian artist Johann Peter 
Krafft.
