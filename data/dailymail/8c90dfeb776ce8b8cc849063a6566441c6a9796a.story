Google has been accused of turning a blind eye to child sex predators after it refused to sign up to an alert system that could stop paedophiles viewing vile images online.

Search engine Bing, which is owned by Microsoft, announced on Saturday that it would automatically flash up warning messages on the screens of users who type in terms that could lead them to child abuse sites.

The warnings, which experts say would deter half of paedophiles by reminding them that their criminal activity can be tracked, will also be used by Yahoo!.

But Google has infuriated child safety campaigners  and experts by refusing to take part, because it believes its own methods in tackling the problem are more effective.

Earlier this year it emerged that Mark Bridger, who abducted and killed five-year-old April Jones in Powys, collected a ‘library’ of sickening images by searching for simple terms on Google and Bing.

Stuart Hazell, who killed 12-year-old Tia Sharp from Croydon, also progressed from online child porn to murder.

Microsoft’s warning system on Bing would be activated automatically when users type in terms that could lead them to child porn. Typing in the terms, chosen in consultation with the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop), will cause a notice to appear on screen, stating: ‘Warning! Child abuse material is illegal.’ It will also include a link to advice on how to seek counselling.

Experts said the warnings, known as splash pages, would deter a huge number of offenders.

John Carr, a leading government adviser on online child safety, said: ‘The splash pages will not stop determined paedophiles but while they are very dangerous, they are a small number.

‘These messages will warn off a larger number of men who are interested in these pages and stop them in their tracks.

‘At the beginning an interest in these images starts off as a mild curiosity but they get drawn in and in some cases it can lead to rape and abuse.

‘These messages show them they are not anonymous. Half would be put off by this.’

Mr Carr said stopping these men at an early stage would also allow police to focus on more extreme offenders.

‘What Bing and Yahoo! are doing is brilliant. If they show it can be done effectively, it will be very difficult for Google to continue to refuse as well,’ he added.

A spokesman for the Lucy Faithful Foundation, which works with child sex abuse victims and offenders, also said the warnings would deter many paedophiles.

A Google spokesman said it was working with experts on ways to deter offenders. ‘We use purpose-built technology and work with child safety organisations to find, remove and report child abuse imagery, because we never want this material to appear in our search results,’ he added.
