A two-stone cat has become the heaviest ever to be taken in by the country's most famous animal welfare home.

The morbidly obese pet was taken to Battersea Dogs and Cats Home weighing in at 26 pounds, and has been put on a diet in time for Christmas.

Staff at the home say he is the biggest cat they've ever seen and have now nicknamed him Texas, after the large American state.

Texas, the overweight cat, who is the heaviest to be ever taken in by Battersea Dogs and Cats Home 

Staff at the home gave the cat the name Texas, after the large American state. He also has to have specialist equipment fitted in his pen due to his weight 

The eight-year-old long-hair's weight is so extreme, his pen has even had to be fitted out with specialist equipment to cope.

SuiLi Weight, a team leader at the home in south-west London, said: 'Many people may be starting to think about losing a few pounds in the countdown to Christmas, but for Texas this really is a very serious health issue he's battling.

'At Battersea we take in around 3,000 cats every year, so we see cats of all shapes and sizes, but Texas is by far the biggest cat we've ever seen.

'We have had to specially kit out his pen with a double-wide staircase up to his bed and extra bedding to make sure he is comfortable.'

Texas is now on a strict diet and exercise regime in a bid to lose weight while a foster home is found for him 

Texas was taken into Battersea Dogs and Cats Home when his owner passed away and is three times his normal weight due to being overfed.

He is now on a strict diet and exercise regime while a foster home is found for him.

Ms Weight added: 'Some people might think it's funny to see a cat this big but it is in fact extremely sad to see an animal which is suffering so badly.

'Overfeeding your cat is a form of cruelty, you may think you are showing it love by giving it treats and feeding it human foods, but it's in fact an incredibly cruel thing to do in the long run.'
