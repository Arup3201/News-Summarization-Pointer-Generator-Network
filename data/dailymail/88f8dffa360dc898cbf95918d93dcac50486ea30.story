Eurovision came to Oxford yesterday — not the daft costumes and dubious singing, but the embarrassment of ‘nil points’ for London Welsh, on their Aviva Premiership return.

This was a chastening occasion for the promoted Exiles and for the competition as a whole. The numbers added up to a low-key mismatch, as Exeter rattled along to their first half-century in the top division, in front of a meagre crowd of just 2,776 spectators, despite new-season optimism and blue skies over the Kassam Stadium.

The Premiership rightly prides itself on the abundance of close contests it produces, but this was a procession from the 11th minute, when Rob Baxter’s Chiefs struck for the first of their seven tries. By failing to trouble the scorers at their own ground, Welsh suffered the same indignity as Newcastle on the opening weekend last season, when Bath left Kingston Park with 21 unanswered points.

Two years ago, the Exiles marked their arrival among the elite with a respectable 38-13 defeat at home to Leicester, followed by a 40-3 thrashing against Harlequins in London. But they followed those initial setbacks with a 25-24 victory in this fixture — a world away from yesterday’s outcome.

Not even the presence of a World Cup-winning All Black in their ranks, scrum half Piri Weepu (below), could stem the tide. Justin Burnell, who strove to prepare Welsh for the struggle against relegation this season by recruiting 25 new players over the summer, must hope the acclimatisation process is mercifully brief.

After this drubbing, he said: ‘We have to learn from this.There are 10 months of the season to go and we knew what we were getting into. We can either go home and hide away or we can stick our chests out, get the smile back on our faces, get back into training and keep working hard. We’re at Bath next so it doesn’t get easier.’

Reflecting on his side’s defeat, Burnell added: ‘We squandered opportunities by spilling the ball and Exeter were quick to capitalise on our turn-overs. When people make individual errors, it is not about a lack of cohesion or the new signings. We have to make our tackles, make the final pass and hold on to it.’

End in sight: Ian Whitten races clear to score a try for the Exeter Chiefs against London Welsh

While Welsh were easy prey, Exeter were convincing as they went through their high-octane attacking repertoire. Fly half Gareth Steenson under-pinned their performance with seven kicks from as many attempts — not to mention some nifty footwork and distribution — but this was a collective demonstration of slick running and inter-play.

New signing Thomas Waldrom, the former England No 8, began the procession by scoring his side’s first two tries on his competitive debut. First, his off-load sent Haydn Thomas darting clear in midfield and after Steenson maintained the momentum, his pass released Waldrom in the 22 and he blasted over the line. His second try came in the 27th minute, after Tim Molenaar had held Steenson up over the line on the left.

It was 17-0 at the break, but the dam burst in the second half. Dave Ewers capped a fine display from blindside flanker by rumbling in for the Chiefs’ third try, then centre Sam Hill slalomed clear to strike.

On the hour, from a short-range lineout on the left, Ian Whitten burst forward and bounced off two tackles to touch down. Seconds later Jack Arnott claimed a clearance and spun out of a tackle to run to the posts, before full back Chrysander Botha rounded off the rout by storming through heavy traffic and swerving to finish.

For Welsh, this represented a grim early glimpse of the struggle they face in the months ahead, but for Exeter it was an encouraging indication they have the firepower and daring intent to emerge as top-half contenders this season.

‘The conditioners have got our guys in great nick during the summer and we were able to impose our game,’ said coach Ali Hepher. ‘There were times in the first half when we could have been more ruthless but it was pleasing to get a bonus-point win in the first game of the season.’
