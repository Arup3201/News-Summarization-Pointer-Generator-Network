When Charlie Austin left Poole Town to join Swindon in 2009, a group of 16 fans went to a local bookies and placed a tidy sum on him scoring for England one day.

Jem Racing gave them 50-1 odds, fairly slim for a player who joined a League One side, and they handed over £155. They look on course for a payout given Austin’s form for Queens Park Rangers. The 25-year-old became the highest scoring Englishman in the Premier League, behind only Sergio Aguero and Diego Costa in the overall chart, after his hat-trick against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday took him to 11 goals for the season.

But Austin’s value to the non-League side stretches beyond the £7,750 the group are set to receive. Money the club earned from goals and appearances since he left has enabled them to carry out work on their Tatnam ground, essential in winning two promotions.

Directors at Poole knew the add-ons they had written into his Swindon transfer could have amounted to nothing had Austin, then 19, faded into obscurity. He scored 46 goals in 46 games in his first season at the club then 18 in 11 before the move. Coaching staff at Poole noticed improvement when he started training with Bournemouth ahead of his second campaign. Austin netted twice in a 3-0 friendly against them and manager Eddie Howe liked what he saw. But Bournemouth were under a transfer embargo, so Austin trained with their first team and was released to Poole for matches.

That was until Swindon, who had Danny Wilson in charge, beat them to his signature. In a fitting send-off, Austin scored five goals in his final Poole game against Portsmouth side Moneyfields, in front of a home crowd of 88.

‘Swindon didn’t want to pay a fee, they didn’t feel they had to, which was insulting,’ Poole commercial director Mark Bumford explained. ‘They agreed a deal with add-ons for appearance and goal bonuses. He could’ve disappeared into their reserves, but soon started scoring goals and got into the first team.’

Word spread among Poole fans that the club were receiving money every time Austin played 10 games or scored 10 goals for Swindon.

On matchdays they would listen out for how their departed hero was getting on. ‘Charlie scored again, Charlie scored again,’ would spread around the ground. They may not have been aware how important the money would be to the club.

At Poole, Austin and his team-mates were playing home matches on a school field in the Wessex League — the ninth tier of English football. They won the title in his debut campaign and again the following year. Both times they were unable to climb a league due to their ground not being enclosed. Oakdale South Road Middle School — now Oakdale Junior School — and Poole Borough Council would not allow them to improve it. But the club credit Austin’s goals for getting the ball rolling. ‘After that the council and school allowed us to enclose it,’ Bumford said.

‘Then we started receiving money from the add-ons for Charlie and it allowed us to finish work on the ground. We won the league a third season in a row and got promoted.’

They built a stand, a barrier around the pitch and floodlights. It took them two seasons to win promotion to the Southern Premier League, where they are level with leaders Redditch United — but with five games in hand. They spent £260,000 from Austin add-ons to ensure the ground is the required standard for promotion. ‘That’s the end of the Charlie money,’ Bumford added. ‘Tatnam is a different place now.’

It’s a stroke of luck he played there at all. When his family left Hungerford for Bournemouth, his father, Fred, and grandfather, Ozzy, looked for a team of a similar level to the local club where he was playing. They left messages with Poole and rivals Wimborne Town. Poole take great delight that they offered him a trial and he went on to transform their club, while Wimborne never called them back. ‘He was very confident,’ Bumford said. ‘He was a bit of a poser and had a swagger about him. But he was popular with team-mates and a fans’ favourite.’

In September he returned for a benefit game for former Poole strike partner Andy Culliford, who suffers from motor neurone disease.

His importance at QPR is such he was unable to play. He has scored more than half their goals this season and, with Roy Hodgson keeping watch, an England call-up is surely not far away.

You wouldn’t bet against it.
