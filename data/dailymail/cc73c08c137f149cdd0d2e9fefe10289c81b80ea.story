Wojciech Szczesny and a selection of other Arsenal stars posed for a photo on the team bus after victory over against West Ham kept their winning run rolling on.

The Gunners leapt above their opponents with a 2-1 win at Upton Park thanks to goals by Santi Cazorla and Danny Welbeck.

Szczesny and Co have won three of their last four Premier League matches after the wheels threatened to come off following defeat at Stoke.

And the Polish shot stopper celebrated holding on for the win at West Ham with a team photo, which he uploaded on to his Facebook page after making his way back from east London.

Lukas Podolski, Welbeck and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain were among the players who posed for a picture with Szczesny.

The 24-year-old keeper will be hoping his side can claim their third consecutive win (and fourth in five matches) when they face Southampton on New Year's Day.
