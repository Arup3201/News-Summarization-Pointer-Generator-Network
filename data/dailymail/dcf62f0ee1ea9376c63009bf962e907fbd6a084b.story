Southampton have announced that striker Sam Gallagher has signed a new four-year deal at St Mary's.

The 18-year-old has made 19 senior appearances this season after making his debut against Sunderland in the Capital One Cup against Sunderland in November and has now committed to the south coast outfit until 2018.

Gallagher scored his first goal for the club in the FA Cup win over Yeovil and added to that with a league strike against Norwich at St Mary's in March.
