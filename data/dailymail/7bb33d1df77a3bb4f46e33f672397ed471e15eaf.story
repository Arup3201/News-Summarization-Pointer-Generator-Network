People who use emojis in text messages have more sex than those who don't, according to Match.com's annual dating survey.

The Singles in America study polled more than 5,600 single people of all ages, ethnicities, incomes and walks of life; and found that emoji users were more likely to report having sex at least monthly than non-emoji users.

The 'wink' is the most widely used emoji overall, but when you separate men and women, men are more likely to pepper their texts with 'kiss' and 'heart eyes' emojis, while women prefer 'smileys'.

According to biological anthropologist Dr Helen Fisher, who helped lead the study, emojis are popular simply because they help us communicate more effectively in a medium (texting) in which sentiments can otherwise fall flat.

'Technology is dramatically changing how we court, but it can’t change the brain systems for romance', she writes for Match.com.

Indeed, around 50per cent of men and women agree that emojis 'show personality' and around 35per cent of both sexes say they make 'expressing feelings' easier.

Just don't spell your feelings wrong. The study also found that 54per cent of single women and 36per cent of men find misspellings and incorrect grammar to be the biggest text message turn-offs.

Speaking to TIME, Dr Fisher added that women who use 'kiss-related' emojis said they have an easier time achieving orgasms with a familiar partner.

The correlation between sex and emoji use held true for men and women in their 20s, 30s and 40s, and the more regularly people use emojis, the more active they reported their sex lives to be.

And it's not all about flings and casual sex. Emoji users are also twice as likely to want marriage one day. Or perhaps they're just better at expressing their desires.

Good thing there's an 'engagement ring' emoji.
