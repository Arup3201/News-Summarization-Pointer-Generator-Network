Time Warner Cable has become synonymous with less-than-stellar customer service - and changing a subscriber’s name to a sexist slur is not likely to improve the company’s public image.

Esperanza Martinez, from Orange County, California, was surprised to receive a note from the cable provider Monday trying to convince her not to cancel her service - a request she did not make in the first place.

But she was even more surprised to discover that the missive pleading with her to stay with Time Warner was addressed to 'C*** Martinez.'

Not playing nice: Esperanza Martinez, of California, has received a letter from Time Warner Cable addressed to 'C*** Martinez' asking her not to cancel her service 

The offensive sexual profanity was also included in the introduction, 'Dear C*** Martinez.'

Without a hint of irony, the note then went on to say that Time Warner 'has been working on improvements to deliver better experience every day.'

Ms Martinez told the technology blog Ars Technica that she never asked to disconnect her service and was not sure why the letter was sent to her house.

When she finally got on the phone with Time Warner, she learned that the name change was made on February 12 - the same day she had a live chat with a customer service representative about a problem with her cable box.

But Ms Martinez insisted that she was no rude during the online conversation with the Time Warner staffer.

‘I was not upset even when they could not resolve my issue and had to send a technician out,’ she told the blog. ‘I have no idea why a TWC employee would do this and risk losing their job.'

Time Warner has admitted to the mishap, claiming that an employee at a third-party vendor has replaced Ms Martinez's first name with the profanity in the cable provider’s computer system.

Officials at TWC stated that the company has since severed ties with the vendor in question, and they are now reviewing their procedures to make sure this does not happen again.

Comcast, Time Warner's future owner, sent Mary Baeur a bill earlier this month addressed to 'Super B---- Bauer' after she fought with the cable company to get the Hallmark Channel back in her package

Lisa and Ricardo Brown were shocked to receive this bill addressed to 'A**hole Brown' after they tried to cancel their cable from Comcast

Ms Martinez on Thursday received an apology from Time Warner, along with a free year of Internet and cable service.

The embarrassing incident comes at a particularly inopportune time for Time Warner, which is currently in the process of merging with Comcast - the same cable company that made headlines over the past two months for lashing out at their customers.

Less than two week ago, a Comcast subscriber in Illinois got a letter from the cable provider, in which her name was changed from ‘Mary’ to 'Super B**** Bauer' after the woman fought to have the Hallmark Channel added back to her package. 

In late January, Lisa and Ricardo Brown received a bill from the cable giant that was addressed to 'A**hole Brown' after they had an unpleasant exchange with a customer service representative and decided to cancel their service.

Bed reputation: A survery found last year that Time Warner and Comcast, which are in the process of merging, are the two most hated companies in the US

In 2005, one woman had a similar experience when a Comcast invoice addressed her as a 'b**** dog'.

Other customers, who sent their relabeled bills to customer advocacy writer Christopher Elliot, said their names had been changed to 'dummy' and another to 'whore Julia'.

Comcast announced in February 2014 that it will acquire Time Warner Cable for $45billion, raising serious concerns among government regulators and industry experts about the impact the merger might have on the companies' subscribers.

The American Customer Satisfaction Index last year found that Time Warner and Comcast were the two most hated companies in the nation.
