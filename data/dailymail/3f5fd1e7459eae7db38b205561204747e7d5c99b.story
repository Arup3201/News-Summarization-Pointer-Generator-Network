Convicted: Murugasan Natarajan was jailed for six years after evading around £2 million in customs duty while importing garlic from China

A grocer who went on the run after he was caught smuggling garlic was named as one of Britain's worst tax criminals yesterday.

Murugasan Natarajan, 57, dodged paying £2million in import taxes by smuggling tons of fresh garlic from China.

He was one of 32 criminals named and pictured in a 'rogues gallery' of the worst tax cheats of 2012, compiled by HM Revenue and Customs.

Natarajan, of Southall, West London, imported huge containers of fresh garlic without paying duty by telling Customs officials that the product was fresh ginger, which is untaxed.

But inspectors noticed that the containers used for the shipments were too cold for ginger, yet the ­perfect temperature for garlic.

When the containers were opened, hundreds of boxes of fresh garlic were found inside.

Natarajan ran a grocery business, Perfect Imports And Exports, and planned to sell the garlic to wholesalers. He was arrested and released on bail, but went on the run and has not been traced. He was tried in his absence last month and given a six-year jail sentence.

The 32 tax cheats named by HMRC on the photo-sharing website Flickr were all given jail terms last year. Their combined sentences exceed 150 years.

They included jeweller Chaudray Ali, who evaded more than £7million in VAT payments by smuggling gold from the Gulf into Britain. Ali, 50, used couriers to collect gold jewellery from Dubai and take it to Frankfurt airport, where he would collect it.

Goods traded between EU countries are not subject to VAT. Ali, of Hillingdon, West London, was caught and jailed for nine years.

Tax adviser Roy Faichney, 54, was jailed for four years for his part in a £70million fraud.

He was managing director of Vantis Tax
Ltd and profited from a fraudulent tax avoidance scheme sold to wealthy
customers, involving donating worthless shares to charities and then 
claiming tax relief

Rogues gallery: These eight men were jailed in 2012 for their part in alcohol smuggling and phone smuggling frauds

The firm was dubbed the 'singing 
accountants' after Vantis employees performed a version of the Gloria 
Gaynor disco classic 'I Will Survive' at their annual conference, with 
the lyrics changed to celebrate the scam.

One verse went: 'They should have 
changed that stupid law, they should have b***ered charity, but they 
have left that lovely tax relief for folks to pay to me.'

The HMRC gallery features a gang that 
imported 20million cigarettes from Dubai without paying the £3.3million 
duty by declaring them as baby toys.

Another set up a factory in 
Chesterfield capable of making 625million cigarettes a year. HMRC said 
the plot was worth £131million in lost taxes.

Message: Treasury Minister David Gauke says: 'tax dodgers are simply storing up trouble for the future'

The site also featured four men jailed
for a total of 21 years and three months for one of the biggest alcohol
smuggling frauds ever uncovered in the UK - worth £50million a year.

Treasury minister David Gauke said: 
'The Government is ­committed to closing in on tax evaders. Most people 
play by the rules, but HMRC is cracking down on those who don't.

'We hope that publishing these 
pictures will help get across that it always make sense to declare all 
your income, and tax dodgers are simply storing up trouble for the 
future.'

The move comes on the heels of HMRC's July campaign, which published a list of the 'most wanted' tax avoiders in the UK.

This FBI-style list, which received 660,000 hits last month, was published in the hope that members of the public will help in the effort to catch them.

Both campaigns form part of the Government's £917million investment in tackling tax evasion.

Mr Gauke added: 'We hope that publishing these pictures will help to get across that it always makes sense to declare all your income, and tax dodgers are simply storing up trouble for the future."

Others on the list include the managing director of a tax firm who got four years for a "gentleman's agreement" with his deputy to share the £4.5 million profit from a fraudulent tax avoidance scheme sold to wealthy customers.

In his Autumn Statement last month, Chancellor George Osborne announced a further £77million will be put into cracking down on tax cheats.

Ministers are unapologetic about the crack-down, saying that tax evasion and fraud has cost taxpayers around £10 billion a year.

The government says its current plans can allow it to recover an additional £7 billion in lost tax revenue each year.

Alcohol smugglers:

Kevin Ramon Burrage, Gary Dennis Clarke, Michael Brian Turner and Davinder Singh Dhaliwal – 21 years 3 monthsBackground: A criminal gang has been jailed for one of the biggest ever alcohol smuggling frauds ever uncovered in the UK. The scam was worth £50m a year in unpaid duty and VAT and allowed the gang members to spend recklessly on high performance cars and luxury properties throughout Europe.Gang ringleader Kevin Burrage, 49, owned Promptstock Ltd, a bonded warehouse in Essex. His brother-in-law, Gary Clark, 55, managed the warehouse which the pair used to import and export alcohol without paying a penny in tax.

Phone fraudsters:

Lee Sellers, Mehmood Khan Nazir, Umar Khan Nazir and Marshall Boston – 10 years 6 months

Total Case Sentencing (across several years): Dilawar Ravjani, Tamraz Riaz, Zafar Chishti, Rajesh Gathani, Roshan Hussain, Lee Sellers, John McFarnon, John Conroy, Mehmood Khan Nazir, Umar Khan Nazir, Marshall Boston – 66 years 5 months

Background: Dilawar was the ringleader of a gang that led to him being sentenced to 17 years’ imprisonment – the longest sentence to date given to an individual for this type of fraud.

The gang claimed to have sold four million mobile phones worth £1.7 billion. However, in many cases the phones did not exist, including 250,000 which had not been launched in the UK. In an attempt to make the trade appear legitimate, over 5,700 fake business transactions were created to claim large amounts of VAT. One company run by Ravjani, Future Communications, embarked on a complex scheme to defraud by positioning itself in trading chains where it exported phones from a chain that started from a missing trader. At the same time it also acted as an importer, allowing other traders such as Unique Distribution – a sister company – to seek significant VAT payments.

Cigarettes scam:

Phillip William Robinson, Vincent Waller, Phillip William Hall, Christopher John Burns and Andrius Kochanauskas – 13 years 1 monthBackground: A criminal gang which set up a factory potentially capable of making up to 625 million counterfeit cigarettes and five million pouches of fake hand rolling tobacco a year were jailed.The plot, worth over £131 million per annum in lost revenue, was foiled when HM Revenue and Customs criminal investigators swooped and closed down the fully equipped cigarette factory in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, before it went into production. During the raid in September 2009 they discovered that the gang were also planning to expand into making counterfeit alcohol.

Garlic smuggler:

Sentenced in 2012: Murugasan Natarajan – 6 years

Green con:

Sentenced in 2012: Sandeep Singh Dosanjh, Navdeep Singh Gill and Ranjot Singh Chahal – 35 years

Background: A criminal gang who carried out a £38m VAT fraud through a complex chain of fraudulent trades has been jailed for 35 years at Southwark Crown Court following a three year investigation by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).

The gang set up a chain of bogus companies to trade fraudulently in EU emissions allowances – known as carbon credits. In the first case of its kind, the gang stole around £38 million through a complex missing trader fraud in a six-month period starting in January 2009. They were arrested by HMRC officers in a series of dawn raids in August the same year. The law has been changed to prevent carbon credit VAT fraud as a direct result of this investigation.

Precious metal scam:

Mohammed Shabir Karim, Imran Bhatti, Kamran Bhatti
and Raymond Bowden – 22 years and 6 months

Background: Four men from have been jailed for evading over £4.5
million in VAT due on platinum trading. The men were sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court after investigations

The seven men were arrested after some were seen unloading over 10 million illicit cigarettes at a warehouse in Upminster after they had been smuggled into the UK from Dubai through the port of Felixstowe. The total duty evaded is estimated as £3.3 million.

Smuggling gold:

Chaudray Ali – 9 years

Background: A jeweller who evaded more than £7million VAT by smuggling gold into the UK has been jailed for nine years today following an international investigation by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).
