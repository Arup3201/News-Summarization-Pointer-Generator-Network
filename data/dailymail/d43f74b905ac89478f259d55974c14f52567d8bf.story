When the axe swung at Aston Villa, defender Alan Hutton braced himself for a knock-on with Scotland.

Luckily for the right back, national coach Gordon Strachan has never been one for following the rules.

Strachan decided to keep selecting Hutton for his country and it turned out to be the Premier League equivalent of a lifeline.

Hutton has made the short but dramatic journey from outcast to first choice for his club.

‘I felt I had a lot to give and I wanted to do it here. I wanted to prove everybody wrong,’ admitted Hutton.

‘If someone told me last season what would happen this season, I would have laughed. To look back from where I was then to now is a total turnaround.

‘I wasn’t playing here yet I was going up to Scotland and Gordon was picking me in not just friendlies but qualifying games also.

‘I owe a massive amount to him. There was no reason for him to pick me but he did. It kept me going. If I had down time here I used to look to the international games and focus. Your head has to be on it.’

Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert was convinced. Two years after telling Hutton there was no room for him at the club, Lambert had to make a dramatic u-turn.

‘The gaffer watched me play for Scotland and, yes, I suppose it surprised me. Everybody wants to be loved. It’s great for people to be saying nice things about you,’ added Hutton, 30, who has since signed a new three-year contract.

Sadly from Villa’s perspective, they are in yet another relegation battle although pressure has been eased by the midweek win over Crystal Palace.

On Sunday they entertain bottom club Leicester in what has all the hallmarks of a ‘must-win’ game.

Hutton added: ‘The League’s so tight that if you go on a run you can shoot up a few places which we did on Tuesday.

‘A home game with Leicester is one where we can say we need to put down a marker.’
