The girlfriend of a professional para-athlete says that even though her boyfriend has one of the rarest conditions in the world, they are just a normal couple.

Alice Miller, 23, met Tom Staniford, 24, online and says that they ‘clicked instantly’ and are now living together in London.

Mr Staniford is one of only eight people in the world with MDP syndrome, which means that since the age of 12 he has been unable to store fat under his skin or even on the soles of his feet.

Alice Miller, 23, met Tom Staniford, 24, online and says that they 'clicked instantly' and are now living together in London. Mr Staniford is a para-cyclist who is hoping to representing GB in the 2016 Olympics

He also has just 40 per cent of the muscles of an average man and has poor hearing.

Surprisingly, Mr Staniford also suffers from type 2 diabetes - a disease usually associated with obesity.

Miss Miller, who works for custom bike experts CycleFit, travelled from Sheffield, where she was then a student, all the way to Mr Staniford’s hometown, Exeter, for their first date.

She said: ‘We had clicked instantly online, he was so easy to talk to. He told me about his condition and I’d seen a few pictures of him but I didn’t really know what he really looked like until I met him in person.

‘I remember being worried - like any first date - but I wanted an adventure.

‘It was odd to see him in real life. His appearance did take me by surprise and he was much taller than I had expected.’

She added: ‘Initially, I was 
self-conscious because people were staring at Tom but he didn’t let it 
bother him and he instantly put me at ease.

‘He was so friendly and we talked for hours over a meal at the local pub. It was just like any normal first date.’

Miss Miller says the pair are just like any normal couple - apart from the fact that they don’t go clubbing or out for late night drinking sessions.

Mr Staniford explained: ‘I don’t like walking and I can’t stand for long periods because of my condition. Even without it, though, I don’t think I’d be very good at clubbing. I’m a professional athlete so need to keep healthy.’

Surprisingly, Mr Staniford also suffers from type 2 diabetes - a disease usually associated with obesity - because he has unusually high fat levels in his blood

Ms Miller says that she was self-conscious when she first started going out with Mr Staniford because people would stare at him but that he soon put her at ease with his friendly conversation

Scientists at the University of Exeter have recently discovered that Mr Staniford’s condition stems from a genetic mutation.

The new discovery may, in time, help other sufferers with the syndrome.

However, the six foot three inch tall cyclist, who weighs 66 kilos, says he has never let his condition hold him back.

And he has already proved that it is possible to live a normal life.

The law graduate has already been crowned the British National Para-Cycling Circuit Race Champion and dreams of winning gold at the Paralympics in Rio 2016.

Ms Miller said: ‘Living with Tom I’ve had to learn about what he eats. He has to have a controlled diet because of his diabetes and metabolism.

‘But that’s about it - he does most of the cooking and shopping and I just go along to pick out the cakes.’

She says they’ve been together long enough to know each other inside out.

She said: ‘When I look in to my future I see Tom there. We’ve been together so long that we know each other’s strengths and weaknesses and I don’t think there would ever be anything that would get in the way of that.

‘Now I don’t even notice the stares we occasionally get when we go out - Tom isn’t out of the ordinary at all.’

Mr Staniford added: ‘I am very, very fortunate to have Alice. That’s all I can say really. I’m very lucky to have her.’

The cyclist was born at a normal weight, but throughout his childhood and teenage years lost all the fat around his face and limbs.

His condition means he has no natural cushioning on his body, suffers from sore feet, and is at an increased risk of breaking bones in a fall.

Because of the disorder, Tom has unusually high fat levels in his blood, as if he was obese. It is this that has led to him developing diabetes.

His hearing also deteriorated during childhood, and he now wears hearing aids.

Tom hopes the new diagnosis will allow him to be more accurately classified for events and help his chances of success. He is bidding to participate in the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games.

He said: 'In some ways, identifying the syndrome behind my symptoms shouldn't be important - a name is just a name, after all - but it is reassuring to know that there are other people with the condition and that we can lead relatively normal lives,' he said.

Ms Miller said: 'When I look in to my future I see Tom there. We've been together so long that we know each other very well. I don't think there would ever be anything that would get in the way of that'

‘What could prove crucial, though, is enabling me to be properly classified in competitions so that I am not competing at an unfair disadvantage against others.

'I hope to be able to compete for Great Britain in the 2016 Paralympics and this finding could make a real difference to my chances.'

Professor Andrew Hattersley, a Wellcome Trust senior investigator, said: 'Tom's condition has been a puzzle to us for many years. We could see the symptoms, including the very unusual case of type 2 diabetes in someone with no obvious body fat, but did not know what was causing them.

'We had to look at 30 million base pairs (chemical components of DNA) in Tom's DNA, and similar numbers in his family members and other patients, to identify the single mutation. This would not have been feasible even a couple of years ago.'
