Diego Costa is never short of controversy and Sunday was no different as he played a prominent role in Chelsea's 2-0 win against Tottenham in the Capital One Cup final.

The 26-year-old clashed with Tottenham trio Eric Dier, Nabil Bentaleb and Kyle Walker in the first half of the game, as he got stuck into Mauricio Pochettino's men.

Here, Sportsmail looks at Diego Costa's main moments from the Wembley showdown.

7min: It didn't take long for Costa to pick his first personal fight of the afternoon. The striker loses possession after seeing the ball whipped from him by Eric Dier's sliding challenge - with the Chelsea man in no uncertain terms letting the Spurs defender know what he thought of the challenge.

29min: Moving on from Dier, Costa then upsets Nabil Bentaleb, raking his hand down the face of the Algerian while blind to the Spurs midfielder. Play is waved on despite the duo tussling right in front of referee Anthony Taylor.

29min: Walker and Costa are then caught at loggerheads moments later as they have their own falling out following a duel for possession.

Chelsea's main man picked up a coin that was thrown on to the pitch in the first half - tucking it into his shorts. Every little helps after all...

31min: Costa sure does know how to wind Spurs up - that's for sure. Dier - who earlier in the match he clashed with - receives a booking after the Chelsea man goes down under a sliding challenge from him. Spurs players and Dier alike, are furious with the decision.

45min: Dier is lucky to remain on the field after another exchange with Costa, with the latter rolling around in perceived agony following a kick from the 21-year-old.

56min: He's never one to stay out of the headlines and today has been no different. Costa's deflected effort - which goes down as a Walker own goal - looks to all but have secured the Capital One Cup for Chelsea after linking up well with Cesc Fabregas - a familiar scenario for Blues supporters who have watched their side throughout this season.

93min: Costa is replaced in stoppage time by veteran striker and Chelsea's Wembley hero many a time over the years - Didier Drogba. The striker is given a rousing applause by the Chelsea faithful with cries of 'Diego' echoing around Wembley. A job well done in his first cup final for the West Londoners.
