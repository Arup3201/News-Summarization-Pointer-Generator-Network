A man accused of murdering a female sex worker whose body was found in a hotel room on New Year's Day has withdrawn his bail application. 

Chungaung Piao, 27, is charged with murdering Sydney woman Ting Fang, 25, after her body was found in a room at the Grand Chancellor Hotel in Adelaide.

He first appeared in the Adelaide Magistrates court on January 12 where his lawyer indicated he would be applying for release on home detention bail.

Ting Fang, 25, was found murdered in an Adelaide city hotel room with a slashed neck on New Year's Day

Chungaung Piao, 27, who has been charged with her murder appeared in the Adelaide Magistrates Court and withdrew his bail application on Monday

But he appeared again on Monday and his lawyer Julian Kelly withdrew the application. 

The application had been opposed by prosecutor Lucy Boord who had advised Mr Kelly of the strength of the prosecution case.

Ms Fang was found on New Year's Day with her throat slashed. Her internal and external jugular veins had been cut. 

Police at the time said she had been in Adelaide for three or four days. It's is understood she was working as a sex worker.

Ms Fang was found dead in the Hotel Grand Chancellor Hotel when the hallway and the level below her twelfth-floor apartment began to flood. A tap was running in the room where she'd been killed

Ms Boord alleged earlier in court that Piao's fingerprint was found on the victim's shoe, but his said Piao has denied involvement in the murder. 

'My client voluntarily attended the police station on Saturday night... the fingerprint as I understand was found on a shoe, which is not inconsistent with his version of events to police,' Mr Kelly said.

The court was previously told that Piao, a Chinese national on a bridging visa, is married with an eight-month-old baby and has been in Australia for the past four years.  

Magistrate Luke Davis has adjourned the matter to March 31, saying Piao could make a fresh bail application in the future.

The man who has been charged with her murder, Chungaung Piao, is a 27-year-old father-of-one who is from Allenby Gardens in Adelaide's west
