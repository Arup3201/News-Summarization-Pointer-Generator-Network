Police have issued a strange efit of a man they want to speak to, who has a large hairstyle similar to convicted murderer Phil Spector. 

Gloucestershire Constabulary released the image of a clean-shaven man with a large curly blonde mane, coiffured like one of Spector's famous styles.

Officers wish to speak to the man in the efit about four separate incidents involving an 11-year-old boy who was harassed as he walked along a railway. 

Gloucestershire Police has issued an efit of a man they wish to speak to in connection with the harassment of an 11-year-old boy in Tewkesbury, the efit's large curly afro is similar to one of Phil Spector's hairstyles

Spector was pictured during his trial at the Superior Court in Los Angeles in 2005 sporting his mane

They believed the boy, a pupil at Tewkesbury Comprehensive School, was harassed both verbally and physically by the man while walking along the Old Railway Line in Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire. 

There is no obvious reason for the abuse but police noted that all four incidents took place within several months and always in the same location.

Spector, a former American record producer, was convicted of second degree murder in relation to the shooting of actress Lana Clarkson in 2003.

He was sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum 19 years and was known for his elaborate hairstyles over the years. 

However recent images of Spector show the 74-year-old looking thinner and paler, with just wisps of grey hair.

Anyone with information about the incident involving the young boy in Gloucestershire is asked to call 101 and quote incident 170 of October 8.
