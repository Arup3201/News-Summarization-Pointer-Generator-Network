He is used to getting laughs as the quintessentially British Blackadder, Mr Bean and Johnny English - but now Rowan Atkinson could play a dour French detective.

The 59-year-old comic has reportedly been lined up to play Jules Maigret, the popular pipe-smoking police inspector dubbed the Sherlock Holmes of France.

The fictional character last featured in a 12-part ITV series 21 years ago starring Michael Gambon, and the channel is hoping to revive the story again, it was reported.

The claims, made today in the Sunday Express, come a year after Mr Atkinson won praise in his first non-musical West End performance for 25 years.

He starred in Quartermaineâ€™s Terms, a touching 1982 tragicomedy following the bittersweet lives of seven language teachers.

An unnamed executive told the newspaper ITV was attempting to capitalise on the success of Scandinavian crime dramas such as The Killing and The Bridge, which has been adapted into a British version called The Tunnel.

The executive said: 'The Maigret stories feel perfectly suited to television's continuing obsession with atmospheric foreign crime'.

Jules Maigret was coined by the celebrated Belgian writer Georges Simenon, who wrote 75 novels about the fictional Parisien detective over a 40-year period from 1931.

His trademark pipe, fondness of fine alcohol and reliance on godlike intuition led him to be compared to Sherlock Holmes, created by Arthur Conan Doyle almost 50 years earlier.

Both had their sidekicks and nemeses, but while Holmes was known for his wit and charm, Maigret was famed for his serious devotion to each case.

Maigret has been a TV hit as far afield as Japan and Russia, and the character's greatest success in Britain came when he was played by Rupert Davies in a long-running 1960s series on the BBC.

ITV's recreation in 1992 and 1993 was always going to be difficult - as Simenon himself, who died in 1989, had personally approved Rupert Davies to play the role on the BBC.

An ITV spokesman today said she was unable to confirm or deny the reports. Mr Atkinson's agent did not immediately return requests for comment.
