A police force faced with slashing its budget is dealing with some victims of crime over the phone in a bid to save money.

Lancashire Police now no longer deploys Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) resources to routine vehicle crime and routine criminal damage.

And it has changed the way it deals with lost property, minor thefts and non-domestic burglaries - speaking to some victims of crime over the phone instead of in person.

Police Federation bosses say they fear changes to how police handle crime could dent the public’s confidence in the force.

Federation chairman Rachel Baines said: 'Quite often there’s a whole section of society whose only contact with the police is when they are a victim of minor crime.

'You can’t take 700 police officers out and carry on doing what you did before. It’s the thin end of the wedge. It’s not just about public safety, it’s public confidence.

'The officers want to provide the same level of service but they can’t. It’s government policy, the chief constable has got no option but to reduce the budget.

'The cuts have got to come from somewhere. The cuts are starting to show, they are only just being felt.'

Attendance to non-domestic burglaries and minor theft is now 'dependent on a number of factors' and the force says 'victims are spoken with and the action that is appropriate to be taken given the circumstances is explained by officers'.

The police say the approach supports 'meeting the challenges presented by shrinking budgets' but say they know people ‘wish to report incidents and crime in a way that suits them such as online or over the telephone.'

The force has already identified £60m of the required savings, and have already taken £40m out of the budget, with a further £20m being taken out in this financial year.

It still needs to find about £19m to meet the savings target by 2017/2018.

Paul Hansen, 35, from Preston, Lancashire, was left angry and frustrated after he contacted police when his moped was stolen and after recovering the vehicle himself was told the police couldn't send a CSI team out because of budget cuts.

The moped, which Mr Hansen was restoring, was stolen from outside his house and after reporting it to the police he found it himself, smashed up by the canal. Mr Hansen said the vehicle was 'blatantly covered in fingerprints'.

He said he had no complaints about the officer he dealt with but slammed the fact the police wouldn't come out as 'pathetic'.

The father-of-one said: 'As somebody that pays taxes we are supposed to have faith in the police.

'Somebody can steal a motor vehicle or cause criminal damage and the police are not interested.'

A Lancashire Police spokesman said: 'Due to the Comprehensive Spending Review and subsequent restructure of the force, CSI staff and resources have reduced.

'As a consequence, it is necessary to prioritise the nature of work in line with risk and threat.

'Therefore Chief Officers made the difficult decision not to deploy CSI resources to routine vehicle crime, effective from April 1, 2014.'

Lancashire Police now no longer deploys 
Crime Scene Investigation resources to:

- Routine vehicle crime

- Routine criminal damage

Some victims of crime will be deal with over the phone instead of in person if the crime is:

- Lost property

- Minor thefts

- Non-domestic burglaries

Assistant Chief Constable Mark Bates explained: 'Every report of crime to Lancashire Constabulary is scrutinised by a police officer and a decision is made on the most appropriate course of action.

'This action could range from the immediate attendance of an officer, through to a telephone-based investigation.

'The police officer will decide on the most appropriate level of investigation by considering what information is available, by assessing the threat, risk and vulnerability of the victim and considering the ‘solvability’ of the crime.

'Not all reports of crime receive a police attendance, in fact some people prefer to be dealt with quickly over the telephone, but regardless of the crime "type" they all go through this initial process of investigation.

'I would like to point out that we have not stopped dealing with non-domestic burglaries and minor thefts.

'However, the way we deal with them has changed. As with all crimes. we assess each of these types of incidents that come into us and from that.

'We decide whether there is a realistic chance or being able to solve the crime with the evidence available.'

Lancashire’s Police and Crime Commissioner, Clive Grunshaw said while it is 'no secret' that the force has 'diminishing resources' the way 'people wish to deal with the police is changing.'

He added: 'Forensic evidence is not always available, and this has to be taken into account when decisions are taken around officer deployment.

'As part of my ongoing scrutiny of the Chief Constable, I am committed to ensuring decisions taken around deployment do not adversely impact on the trust, confidence and satisfaction levels of residents with Lancashire police.'
