Regular doctors will be given the boot and instead Commonwealth appointed doctors will be used to rid the country of rorters falsely claiming millions in Disability Support Pensions.

Part of a $16 billion crackdown on welfare, the Australian government plans to stamp out 'doctor shopping' - where cheats use GPs that are known to be less strict with their disability assessments.

The government will install their own doctors to carry out the assessments, which it is expected will weed out up to 50,000 cheats each year, saving an estimated $70million, according to The Daily Telegraph.

Figures show the number of Australians receiving the benefit had jumped to more than 800,000

In July social services minister Kevin Andrews ordered a review of all applicants aged under 35, after figures showed the number of Australians receiving the benefit had jumped to more than 800,000. 

Since then, more than 8000 have been sent to employment ­services to find a job.

Mr Andrews believes the new changes, that see government appointed doctors assessing applicants, will ensure more 'consistency and equity'.

They are also there to protect the people who have a genuine disability, who cannot work any longer. 

'This measure is not aimed at those who may never be able to work, but rather at ­people who can work with ­independent advice and the right support,' he told The Daily Telegraph.

In the last financial year, taxpayers were saved millions of dollars when more than 400 people were investigated for dishonest claims

'By improving the workforce participation of people with disabilities we can grow a stronger economy with greater benefits for all Australians,' he said. 

In the last financial year, taxpayers were saved millions of dollars when more than 400 people were investigated for dishonest claims, although that's only a small piece of the takings, with taxpayers paying $16 million to those on disability pensions.

The new rules are set to come in from January one.
