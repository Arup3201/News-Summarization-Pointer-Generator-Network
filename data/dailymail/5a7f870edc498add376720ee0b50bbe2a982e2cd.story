An Olympic athlete has been left 'devastated' after his house was burgled during his mother's funeral.

Andy Turner, a 110 metre hurdler, had his white Range Rover sport and a Macbook laptop taken from his home in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire.

Police believe he was deliberately targetted  after he publicised the cremation on social media because his mother 'would have wanted people at the funeral'.

Andy Turner, who won bronze at the World Championships in Daegu, has been burgled during his mother's funeral. Thieves made off with his car, laptop, two iPhones and a personalised Nike bag

Yvonne Turner died suddenly from a stroke on October 29 aged just 58.

Andy, 33, had to cut short the funeral after a neighbour phoned to say his car was missing from outside the family home.

When he arrived he found the house had been ransacked, and while his medals were still there, other valuable possessions were gone.

Shortly afterwards the athlete tweeted: 'A car is replaceable but I had my last photos with my mum alive on my phone and laptop, that's what hurts the most.'

The car, which has a personalised numberplate made to look like '110 RUN' was later found dumped in Bilborough,

However, two iPhones belonging to his mother, along with his personalised Nike bag, are still missing.

Speaking to The Sun, Andy said: 'I feel sickened. Mum was my biggest fan - she was always at my races, always supporting me.

'I've had to put my three daughters in a hotel because they're too scared to stay in the house.'

The athlete had already tweeted that his mother's untimely death was 'the worst end to the worst eight days of my life'.

Andy was widely tipped for success at the Olympics after winning a bronze medal at the World Championships in Deagu in 2011, but crashed out in the semis after being held back by injuries. He had previously competed in the 2004 and 2008 Games.

The Nottingham-born athlete is the third fastest British sprint hurdler of all time behind Colin Jackson and Tony Jarrett and won gold medals at both the Commonwealth Games and European Athletics Championships in 2010.

Nottinghamshire Police said: 'Police are investigating a break-in at a house in Nottingham Road, Hucknall, that happened some time between 2pm and 8.30pm last night.

‘Thieves gained entry via the back of the house. Keys and a white Range Rover Sport with the registration number L10 RUN was stolen, along with a number of other items including a laptop.'

Andy competed in the 2004, 2008 and 2012 Olympics and is the third fastest British sprint hurdler ever after Colin Jackson and Tony Jarrett
