Scientists have discovered the two-million-year-old fossil remains of a fox.

The ancient ancestor of the modern-day animal was found in South Africa at a site known as the Cradle of Humankind because of its significance in human fossil discoveries.

In 2008 the Malapa site yielded the discovery of Australopithecus sediba - thought to be an early human ancestor that combines simian and modern human characteristics.

The 'Cradle ofÂ  Life' is one of eight World Heritage Sites in South Africa.

In 2008 the 47,000 hectare site site yielded the 
discovery of Australopithecus sediba - thought to be an early human 
ancestor that combines simian and modern human characteristics.

The world-renowned Sterkfontein Caves is home to the oldest and most continuous paleaontological dig in the world.

It is also the site of discovery of the famous pre-human skull affectionately known as 'Mrs Ples', and an almost complete hominid skeleton called 'Little Foot', dated 2.3 and 4.17 million years old respectively.

A. Sediba was also dated at two-million-years-old so it looks like man and fox were just as well-known to each other as they are today.

The discovery of the ancient mammal remains were made on Tuesday by teams from the South African universities of Johannesburg and Witwatersrand.

The new fox fossils consist of a mandible and parts of the skeleton and can be distinguished from any living or extinct form of fox known to science based on proportions of its teeth and other aspects of its anatomy.

'The evolutionary history of foxes (Tribe Vulpini) is muchless well understood than that of the larger dogs of the Canisgroup,' the researchers wrote.

Dr. Brian Kuhn from the University of Witwatersrand, head of the Malapa carnivore studies, said: 'It's exciting to see a new fossil fox.

The team say the animal they found was relatively small.

'Jackals (Canis sensu lato) and wild dogs (Lycaon) are much larger than the specimen,' they wrote.

'The ancestry of foxes is perhaps the 
most poorly known among African carnivores and to see a potential 
ancestral form of living foxes is wonderful.'

Professor Lee Berger, director of the Malapa project notes, also from Witwatersrand, said: 'Malapa continues to reveal this extraordinary record of past life and as important as the human ancestors are from the site.

'The site's contribution to our understanding of the evolution of modern African mammals through wonderful specimens like this fox is of equal import.

'Who knows what we will find next?'

The entire team has expressed their privilege in naming the new species after - John Skinner, one of the great names in the study of African mammals and particularly carnivores.
