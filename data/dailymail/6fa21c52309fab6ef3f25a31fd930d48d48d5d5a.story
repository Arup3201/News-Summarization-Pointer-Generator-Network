Liverpool expect to take a significant step forward on Monday in their pursuit of Alberto Moreno after agreeing a fee with Sevilla for £16.2million, which will rise on performances.

The left back is due to fly to England on Monday and travel to Merseyside with his father and his agent Javier Moya.

Moreno was at the wedding of Liverpool’s Luis Alberto on Saturday, according to Spanish newspaper Estadio Deportivo, where he heard good reports about the Anfield dressing room.

Luis Alberto, meanwhile, who moved from Sevilla to Liverpool last summer for £7m, has been discussing a loan to Malaga.

Liverpool midfielder Suso, who was initially proposed as part of the deal for Moreno, may now move to Portuguese side Porto, who have expressed an interest.

The 20-year-old has one year left on contract and Porto are keen to secure a quick deal.

Liverpool also plan talks with Iago Aspas, whose agent has stated he wants to stay but they will sell if he is unhappy at being a back-up striker.

Hughes asks Barca about Traore (after signing Sidwell on a free)

Stoke are exploring the possibility of signing Barcelona starlet Adama Traore.

Manager Mark Hughes has completed a free transfer deal for experienced midfielder Steve Sidwell, 31, but is also looking to add more flair to his Stoke squad.

Impressed by the success of Gerard Deulofeu's loan spell at Everton, Hughes has gone to his former club Barcelona to ask about 18-year-old Traore, who was one of the young stars to shine at the NextGen Series and last year's UEFA Youth League.

Traore made his La Liga debut in November at the age of only 17, replacing Neymar in the 4–0 home win over Granada. Three days later he made his first appearance in the UEFA Champions League, coming on for Cesc Fabregas in the 82nd minute of the 2-1 defeat loss to Ajax.

Born just a few miles away from the Nou Camp to a housemaid mother and a father who works in a shop changing wheel rims, Adama played for Spain’s youth teams up to U19 level but is changing international allegiance to Mali.

Stoke signed Marc Muniesa from Barcelona last summer and hope to build on that relationship.

QPR move for Rio may stall

Any proposed move for Rio Ferdinand at QPR may stall as the club assesses the profile of player they are chasing.

Some within the club would prefer players who are not at the end of their career. While many would recognise Ferdinand's experience and ability will help settle those around him, others believe there is already enough experience in the squad and they should recruit more youthful targets.

QPR have offered 34-year-old goalkeeper Rob Green a new three year contract and have offered deals to Clint Hill, 35, and Alejandro Faurlin, 27, while goalkeeper Julio Cesar will return from his loan at Toronto but is expected to move back to Brazil.

Barcelona say no as United linked with enquiry for Alba

Manchester United have been linked with an enquiry for Barcelona left back Jordi Alba but the Spanish club have no desire to sell.

Barcelona will look to raise funds from the sale of Cesc Fabregas, Pedro, Dani Alves and Alexis Sanchez but 25-year-old Spain defender Alba is very much part of their plans.

United have been contacted to see if they have interest in Barca's players - and they do - but Louis van Gaal does not consider them as priority positions.

Luke Shaw told Southampton he intended to join Manchester United at the end of the season and the hitch has been Mauricio Pochettino moving to Tottenham.

Southampton don't want to rubber-stamp big-money deals without a new manager being in full agreement.

However, Shaw and Liverpool target Adam Lallana have made it clear where they wish to play next season and it is not at St Mary's.

West Brom turn down Burnley bid for Dawson

Burnley have had a £1million bid rejected for West Bromwich Albion centre back Craig Dawson.

The former England U21 defender was one of the few players to benefit from Pepe Mel's ill-fated spell at West Brom and started many of his games in charge ahead of Jonas Olsson and Diego Lugano.

Sean Dyche is a big fan of Dawson who represented Great Britain at the Olympics and had a successful spell on loan at Bolton last year.

However, the 24-year-old is now seen as being part of Albion's future, so even improved offers may fall on deaf ears.

Sunderland eye up Jakupovic in goalkeeper search

Sunderland are showing interest in Hull City goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic.

Manager Gus Poyet has a lengthy list of goalkeeping targets and Jakupovic is being considered. The 29-year-old has been offered a new deal by Hull but is weighing up his options with Allan McGregor established as number one.

Jakupovic impressed on loan at Leyton Orient last season before being recalled but is keen to return to playing at a higher level. The Swiss international is one of several Hull players with uncertain futures.

Striker Matty Fryatt though will speak to Nottingham Forest on Monday ahead of signing a deal with Stuart Pearce's club. Forest have offered better terms than Hull and Fryatt will have more chance to play regularly.

Forest will also sign 6ft 5ins striker Lars Veldwijk from Excelsior later on Monday.

Napoli decide against Pennant and Samaras moves

Napoli will turn down the chance to sign free agent Jermaine Pennant and Celtic's Georgios Samaras.

The Italians do have an interest in Sandro of Tottenham but the asking price remains prohibitive. Tottenham have again been offered Mirko Vucinic from Juventus although Valencia are also keen.

Tottenham and Everton have shown an interest in Granada midfielder Yacine Brahimi who will star for Algeria in their World Cup campiagn.

Everton scouts were also in the crowd at Saturday's World Cup warm-up between Croatia and Australia. Hull striker Nikica Jelavic scored the only goal in a 1-0 win for Croatia. He was replaced by Arsenal and Chelsea target Mario Mandzukic who has confirmed his desire to leave Bayern Munich this summer.
