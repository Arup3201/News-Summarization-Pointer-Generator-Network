People who obsessively take pictures of what they are eating or cooking and post them online may be ill, according to a leading expert.

Foodstagramming is a trend which involves taking pictures of your food and posting it on Instagram and Twitter.

The craze has become so popular that 
some restaurants have stopped customers from taking photos of their 
meals because the flashes and manoeuvrings of food disrupts other 
diners.

In January, Michelin-starred New York chef David Bouley banned customera who foodstagrammed in his restaurant.

But Dr Valerie Taylor, chief of psychiatry at Women's College Hospital at the University of Toronto, argues that religiously documenting each meal might not only be annoying but the sign of a more sinister problem too.

'I see clients for whom food has become problematic, and they struggle to go out and not have food be the key element of all social interaction: what they eat, when they ate, when they are going to eat again,' Dr Taylor told The Huffington Post.

Dr Taylor gave a talk at the Canadian Obesity Summit in Vancouver last week about eating disorders and the role that food plays in modern society and culture. 

‘The concern becomes when all they do is send pictures of food,’ she added.

‘We take pictures of things that are important to us, and for some people, the food itself becomes central and the rest -– the venue, the company, et cetera -- is background.'

While Taylor argues that producing such images may signal an unhealthy preoccupation with food and in turn an eating disorder, others have linked the consumption of food photography to weight gain. 

Many have blamed the West's obsessive preoccupation with food - dubbing books, programmes, fashionable foods as 'food porn' -  for their bulging waistlines.

A 2012 study carried out by the University of Southern California found that spending a lot of time looking at appetising food online stimulated the brain and causes people to eat too much.
