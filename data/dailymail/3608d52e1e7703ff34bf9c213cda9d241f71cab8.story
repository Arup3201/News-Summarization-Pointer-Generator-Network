The fiancée of convicted rapist Ched Evans stepped out in public today sporting her new engagement ring.

Natasha Massey was spotted out and about for the first time since news of her engagement to the disgraced footballer emerged.

Ms Massey - who has led the campaign against the Evans's conviction - looked relaxed as she walked through Alderley Edge, Cheshire, carrying a Prada handbag and wearing a Rolex watch.

Natasha Massey, the fiancée of convicted rapist Ched Evans, stepped out in public today, sporting her new engagement ring

Ms Massey was spotted in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, just one day after it emerged she had agreed to marry the disgraced footballer

It emerged yesterday that Evans, 25, proposed to Ms Massey two weeks after being released from prison.

The former Sheffield United and Wales striker was released from Wymott prison, Lancashire, on October 17 after serving half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old in his hometown of Rhyl, North Wales.

Ms Massey, the daughter of a millionaire, has constantly shown her public support for Evans and even appeared alongside the footballer in a controversial video he made last month in a bid to 'clear his name'.  

In the clip, Ms Massey appeared to be wearing an 'engagement' ring, but it is now thought to have been a 'commitment ring' which the footballer gave his girlfriend while in prison.

Evans had not wanted to propose while he was in jail, but planned to asked Ms Massey to marry him as soon as he was freed, it was said. 

In the video - which was the first time he had spoken out about the crime - Evans insisted he was guilty only of 'infidelity' against his girlfriend and not the rape for which he was jailed.

Ms Massey, who has continued to protest Evans's innocence since he was convicted of the crime, was seen wearing a ring in a recent video the footballer made in which he claimed he was only guilty of infidelity

But he was heavily criticised for offering no remorse to his victim - who had previously been named by trolls on Twitter and forced to change her name as a result.

Instead, he offered an apology to Ms Massey, who he described as 'the woman I love with all my heart'. 

He said: 'I've constantly regretted my act of infidelity and the damage that has been done on so many fronts because of it.

'The support that's been shown by Natasha, our friends and family during the trial and the time spent in prison has kept me strong. 

It is thought Evans, pictured with Ms Massey before he was convicted, did not want to propose from jail 

'It can't have been an easy thing to stand by someone who the court found guilty of such a destructive act. I will be forever grateful.

'Even though I've been released from prison I'm determined to continue to fight to clear my name.' 

Ms Massey has continued to protest Evans's innocence since he was convicted of rape in April 2012. 

Shortly before his release earlier this month, she wrote on the ChedEvans.com website: 'Not a minute passes when I don't think about Ched, his mental and physical strength is admirable and keeps us all positive.

'When Ched is released the fight to clear his name will continue, however long it takes this is one fight we will not lose.

'My boyfriend was wrongly convicted and we are doing everything in our power to clear his name.'

She later told ITV's This Morning: ‘As soon as I found out that he’d been questioned over rape, my instinct was kind of protective of Ched, and I thought I have to stand by him.

‘So my thoughts and feelings over the cheating were put to one side and I just stepped in to help him through this terrible time.

‘I know Ched and I knew he wouldn’t be capable of committing a crime like that.’ 

Evans's own family have also criticised his lack of remorse, with his aunt Nina Evans, 56, urging him to apologise to his victim.

His victim's father has also spoken out about Evans's ongoing campaign, saying it is making life unbearable for his daughter. 

He said: ‘He’s shown no remorse and every time he makes some fresh appeal or comment, he draws attention to my daughter and risks her being identified and found.

‘She went into hiding because people were trying to track her down and kill her.' 

Evans was jailed for five years at Caernarvon Crown Court in April 2012 for raping the 19-year-old waitress, who was judged to be too drunk to have given her consent to sex.

By law, the victim has a right to lifelong anonymity.

Yet following the jury’s unanimous verdict, her name was tweeted by Evans’s supporters and then re-tweeted more than 6,000 times.

Police gave her a new identity but her cover has been blown twice more, forcing her to adopt a new name each time in a fresh location.

The much-covered story unfolded on May 29, 2011, when Evans, his brother, another man and another footballer, Port Vale defender Clayton McDonald, went out in Rhyl, North Wales.

McDonald encountered the victim in a takeaway kebab shop, where she was already unsteady on her feet. She agreed to go back to his hotel. 

The court was told how McDonald and Evans both had sex with the girl. Evans insisted the sex was entirely consensual, but nevertheless chose to leave the hotel via a fire escape.

The girl was so drunk she could remember nothing of the evening. She woke up the next morning naked and confused.

She told the court she thought her drink had been spiked and called the police later that day, reporting what she thought was the theft of her bag.

Following the police investigation, both men were charged with rape. McDonald, 25, was subsequently acquitted. 

The Criminal Cases Review Commission is currently examining Evans's case as part of his hopes to launch an appeal. He has not been re-signed by his former club or any other team since his release. 

Evans was jailed for five years in April 2012 for raping the 19-year-old waitress, who was judged to be too drunk to have given her consent to sex.

The victim has a right to lifelong anonymity — protection afforded to anyone who has made and allegation of a sexual assault — but her name was revealed on Twitter and retweeted more than 6,000 times by those backing Evans.

The young woman was labelled a ‘slag’, ‘tramp’, ‘bitch’ and ‘whore’ and was subject to death threats.

Nine people were convicted of illegally naming her in 2012. Police put her ‘relocation package’ together and she had to start a new life away from her friends and family in north Wales. 

Some of the abuse amounted to ‘psychological GBH’, to use the description of one senior detective, which left the girl ‘traumatised’.

But Twitter trolls continued to pursue her even though illegal naming carries a maximum fine of £5,000. She had to change her name two more times. 

Police also launched an investigation after CCTV footage of his victim was published on Ched Evans's official website.

Under a video titled 'Too drunk to remember?', the woman could be seen walking into the Premier Inn in Rhyl where she was attacked by Evans.

After his release, the father of Ched Evans's victim pleaded for the former Sheffield United striker to stop trying to clear his name because it is 'destroying' his daughter.
