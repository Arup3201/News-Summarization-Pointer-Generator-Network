Christian Bale has said drones would be sent out after biblical character Moses had he been real and alive today.

Bale, who plays Moses in Exodus: Of Gods and Kings, the forthcoming biblical epic directed by Ridley Scott, added that although Moses is depicted as a freedom fighter in the Bible, he is seen as a 'terrorist' by his enemies.

The says he came to these conclusions while studying religious books and scriptures from different religions, including the Bible, the Torah and the Koran.

Christian Bale said drones would be sent after 'terrorist' Moses had the character been real and alive today

'What would happen to Moses if he arrived today? Drones would be sent out after him, right?,' Bale said in an interview with ABC's Nightline.

'[He was] absolutely seen as a freedom fighter for the Hebrews, but a terrorist in terms of the Egyptian empire.'

He also praised British director Ridley Scott, the man behind blockbusters such as Gladiator, Blade Runner and Alien.

'What he is writing is a story of revolution,' Bale said. 'And that's a story that can resonate, no matter what time.'

Bale has previously hit the headlines over his interpretation of the fictional religious hero, after he described Moses as ' schizophrenic ' and 'was one of the most barbaric individuals that I ever read about in my life'.

He upset several Christian writers with his comments, who claimed they meant that Exodus: Of Gods and Kings would not stick to the Bible.

Christian writer, Brian Godawa, wrote on his blog that he hoped Bale's comment was 'a reflection of the actor's own ignorant bigotry than of the actual movie.'

Chris Stone, the founder of Faith Driven Consumer, an organisation which campaigned to reinstate Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson following the show's suspension over homophobic slurs, said he was surprised by Bale's description of Moses, The Hollywood Reporter wrote.

'There's nothing in the biblical history that supports that,' he said. 'It's an indication that there will be a tremendous disconnect between Bale's interpretation and the expectations of the market.'

Exodus: Of Gods and Kings, is due out on December 12.
