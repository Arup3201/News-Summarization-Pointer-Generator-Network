A British ticket-holder came forward yesterday to claim a staggering £101 million EuroMillions jackpot – but the identity of the winner remains a mystery.

The prize is the third biggest won in the UK, and makes the lucky ticket-holder £1 million richer than pop star David Bowie, the 703rd richest person in the country.

A National Lottery spokeswoman said last night: ‘This is amazing news – we are absolutely delighted for the winner.

‘We’ve got the champagne on ice and look forward to welcoming the ticket-holder into the National Lottery millionaires’ club.’

It was unclear last night if the jackpot had been won by a single ticket-holder or by a syndicate. The winner contacted representatives of Lottery organiser Camelot yesterday by telephone to report they had the seven winning numbers.

The numbers from Friday night’s draw were 18, 26, 34, 38 and 42.

The Lucky Star numbers were 5 and 8. Subject to checks, the prize could be paid out as early as tomorrow morning when the banks open.

Scottish couple Colin and Chris Weir scooped the biggest-ever EuroMillions jackpot of £161million earlier this year.

The latest lucky British winner may look to the husband and wife from Largs for inspiration on how to spend their fortune.

Mr and Mrs Weir decided to buy homes for son Jamie, 22, and 24-year-old daughter Carly, a photography student.

They also modestly aimed for driving lessons for them both and said Jamie would probably quit his job at a call centre.

The loaded pair also intended to 
start their own charity and travel to Cambodia, Thailand and Australia, 
where Mr Weir wanted to visit mystical Ayers Rock.

Mr Weird jokily said he wanted to keep his 'reliable' Suzuki SX4 and six-year-old Suzuki Ignis.

But Mrs Weir insisted she wanted a Lexus Prius Hybrid.

However, the winner is not expected to meet Camelot officials until later in the week to have their claim validated.Officials will then advise them on setting up a more secure bank account in which to transfer the funds – an eye-watering £101,203,600.

The biggest ever EuroMillions prize was a £161m jackpot won by Colin and Chris Weir, from Largs in Scotland, in July.

The second largest was claimed by a single ticket-holder, who chose to remain anonymous after scooping £113m in October last year.

The fourth-biggest EuroMillions prize winner in the UK won £84million last May.

In
February 2010, Nigel Page and Justine Laycock, from Gloucestershire, 
broke the then record with a £56million win – now the fifth-biggest 
prize in the history of EuroMillions. 

The sixth-biggest payout went to Les and Sam Scadding in South Wales who won £45millon in November 2009. 

Subject to checks, the prize can be paid out as early as Monday morning when the banks open their doors.

The millionaires will now be able to buy six of the world’s most expensive watches – a diamond-encrusted timepiece from Chopard costing £15millon each.

Or they could treat themselves to 720 pairs of the world’s most expensive shoes – the £140,000 diamond-encrusted heels made by the House of Borgezie.

They could also buy 600 top-of-the-range sports cars – the Ferrari 458 Italia costs a mere £170,000.

For a party to celebrate the win, they could easily afford Barbadian singer Rihanna, who charges £500,000 for a performance.

But if they wish to avoid long-lost family members who are no doubt set to come out of the woodwork, the winners could escape to their own private island, such as £100million Rangyai near Phuket in Thailand.

The 110-acre private island boasts white beaches as well as tropical forests.
