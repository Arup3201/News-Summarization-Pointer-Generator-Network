Two black teens were suspended from their Missisippi high school for the rest of the year after inadvertently making gang signs in a photo during science class.

On the last Friday in January, Olive Branch High School students Dontadrian Bruce, 15, and Desmond Davis, 16, were photographed by their science teacher as they were working on a project about DNA.

In the pictures, the two men smile while holding up their thumb, index and middle finger, with their palms facing outward.

No tolerance: Olive Branch High School student Dontadrian Bruce, 15, was pictured using a gang symbol at school at the end of January and was initially suspended along with another teen for the rest of the year

Didn't know: Dontadrian's friend Desmond Davis was also suspended for throwing up the gang symbol, but he says he didn't know it was a gang affiliation and was just in tribute to his older brother's football number (Dontadrian and Desmond are not related)

The following Monday morning, both boys found themselves in the assistant principal's office.

'You’re suspended because you’re holding up gang signs in this picture,' Assistant Principal Todd Nichols said according to Dontadrian. 'You're a gangbanger.'

And Dontadrian believes the school administration prejudiced their decision based on his race.

'They figured I was a gang member because of my color,' he told NBC News.

Dontadrian says he was holding up the sign because three is his football jersey number while Demond says he was doing it in tribute to his older brother - whose football jersey is also the same number.

Little did they know, the gesture is also a symbol of the Vice Lords, a Chicago-based gang which has a strong presence in nearby Memphis, Tennessee.

Dontadrian's mom Janet Hightower was surprised when she was called to the school over the incident with her A- and B-average son.

Olive Branch High School administrators eventually reversed their decision to suspend the two boys in the wake of outrage online

'He's a good child,' Ms Hightower said. 'I know what he does 24 hours a day. If he leaves home and goes two houses down, he's gonna text me and let me know.'

Dontadrian says he tried to argue his case, but 'it was like they didn't even care'.

Three days later Dontadrian was called to a disciplinary hearing where he was informed that he would not be allowed back at school until the next year.

Desmond's parents were equally as upset to hear about their son's suspension.

'I thought it was crazy,' Desmond's father Van Davis said. 'When does he have time to be in a gang? He barely goes outside, he goes to school, church and back home.'

Word spread fast of the boys' dismissal, and many in the community were outraged with one person starting a Facebook support group for Dontadrian  which quickly garnered over 2,000 'likes'.

Desmond's older brother Dontavius Bruce got suspended as well after having friends in one of his classes pose with the sign to show support.

The school district defended its decision initially, saying gang symbols are against school rules as spelled out in the student handbook.

'Safety is our number one priority,' DeSoto County Schools Spokeswoman Katherine Nelson said in a statement, 'Gangs are a serious threat to our schools.'

But after the story swept the internet, the school was forced to reverse its decision and now both men are back after missing over 15 days of class.

DeSoto Schools superintendent Van Alexander says they may be looking into changing school policy about gang paraphernalia starting next year.

'We’re looking at possible revisions for the upcoming school year,' said Alexander. 'But safety still has to be the number one priority. It just has to be.'
