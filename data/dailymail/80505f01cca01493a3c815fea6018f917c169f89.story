With her carefully waved blonde hair, smoky eye make-up and professional pout, the similarity is undeniable.

But 25-year-old Michaela Weeks’s resemblance to Britney Spears doesn’t just earn her a few double takes in the street. In fact, it’s earned her £300,000.

At 17 she ditched her waitressing job in Ilkeston, Derbyshire to become a full-time impersonator – and the gamble paid off.

Her earnings allowed her to buy her first house at 19, and a second three years later. She has spent £30,000 on a fleet of sports cars including an Audi TT, a Mercedes SLK and a Toyota MR2.

Michaela, who can charge up to £3,500 for a personal appearance, said: 'I feel very blessed to look like Britney and to be living the life I am now. I bought my first house at the age of 19 when most people my age were living with their parents, working in TopShop and still going to college.

'The best part is that I'm a huge Britney fan - it would be awful if I had to impersonate someone I hated. If I ever get to meet her I just want to thank her for giving me this life and for looking so much like me.'

She bought her first house aged just 19 with partner mechanic Craig Warrington, 28, for £115,000 and three years later they bought their second home for £150,000.

Michaela considers herself 'Lucky' that her resemblance to Britney has seen her travel the world on assignments. She has starred in a Kaiser Chiefs video and even posed for renowned celebrity spoof photographer Alison Jackson.

Over the years she has earned £300,000 impersonating the star.

But life was very different for Michaela before, who worked in her local cafe in Ilkeston in Derbyshire for two years until she was 17. Wiping down tables and serving customers was her daily routine but now she belts out hits in front of thousands of screaming fans across the world.

Britney Spears caused a sensation when she appeared in her Toxic music video as a sexy air hostess

Michaela bought her first house at the age of 19 with her partner for £115,000 and three years later they bought their second home for £150,000

She first realised her striking resemblance to the pop icon when Britney burst onto the music scene with Baby One More Time in 1998.

Over time the catcalls of 'hit me one more time' and 'Hey, it's Britney!' from passersby in the street became more frequent and Michaela eventually entered a lookalike competition for Granada TV at the age of 16.

Incredibly she failed to make the cut but the following year she was called back on the show, called Stars and Their Doubles, and won her category.

Michaela said: 'I tried a bit of modelling after that but every time I tried to do something different people kept coming back to the Britney thing.

'In the end the pull was so strong I packed in my waitressing job and decided to give it a go full-time and I haven't looked back since.'

From there, work as a Britney lookalike started flooding in and Michaela began putting together a tribute act with the help of a vocal coach and choreographer.

But it has not all been plain sailing for the Spears lookalike. Michaela nearly lost her home when Britney suffered her much publicised breakdown in 2007.

Michaela's success means her day-to-day life now is a far cry from her old life where she worked as a waitress

The troubled singer spent spells in rehab, attacked paparazzi, lost control of her finances and custody of her children and famously shaved her head.

Michaela's fortunes began to mirror those of her famous counterpart and as Brit's stardom began to wane, so did her lookalike's.

She said: 'When Britney first had her meltdown and shaved her hair I was still getting bookings and even went out to LA for a job. The wilder she acted, the more work I was getting.

'But then my partner and I moved house, taking out a bigger mortgage. We figured no matter what Britney did there was nothing that would stop my busy work schedule because the press always lapped up her antics.

'But then Britney stayed out of the limelight for a long time and my work started to dry up. We soon fell behind with our mortgage, and I had to sell my sports car to pay off some of our debts.

'It was a really difficult time and I began to feel desperately low and guilty for getting us into such a mess. I struggled to get regular work with the recession, and ended up working for agencies and doing odd jobs to try and keep up with the bills.

'The only proper job I'd ever had was being Britney and although I had a beauty qualification I had never put it to any use. I had nothing to fall back on.

When Britney recovered from her 2007 breakdown, out of the public eye, work dried up for Michaela, causing financial hardship and worries about the future, but Britney's comeback means work is up again

'We went through the winter not being able to have the heating on because we couldn't afford to pay the bills and we had to layer up with jumpers and socks and snuggle under blankets just to keep warm.'

The work soon took off again as Britney released her fifth studio album Blackout, going on tour and making the top ten in charts all around the world.

Michaela said: 'Work slowly started coming in again with odd appearances here and there, which helped towards the bills.

'The more she did, the more work I started to get again and we started to get back on track.

'It was a really difficult time but I'm still so grateful for being able to do what I do, I feel really lucky to get to do such a cool job and something I really enjoy.'
