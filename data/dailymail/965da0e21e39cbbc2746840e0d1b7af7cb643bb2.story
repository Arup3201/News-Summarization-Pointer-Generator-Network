London has beaten cross-Channel rival Paris in the race to be Europe's most visited city in the latest research released by Euromonitor International.

Great Britain's capital welcomed 16.8 million arrivals compared to their France counterpart's 15.2m in figures released revealing the international tourist arrivals.

The top three cities on the top 100 list, Hong Kong, Singapore and Bangkok, remain unchanged from 2012 as they continue to benefit from bustling populations and close proximity to China. 

London recorded more arrivals from international tourists than Paris in Euromonitor's latest report

Paris had 15.2million visitors to be fifth in the top 100 cities for arrivals, but London was fourth with 16.8m

Hong Kong remains top of the top 100 visited cities, ahead of Singapore and Bangkok

Outbound travel from China is heavily influential for many of the cities listed, but tourists aren't flocking to China. 

However, the world's most populous nation does remain the leading country for the number of cities featured in the top 100 with a total of eight, according to the exhaustive statistics analysing travel in 2013. 

1) Hong Kong, Hong Kong (25,587.3million)

2) Singapore, Singapore (22,455.4m)

3) Bangkok, Thailand (17,467.8m)

4) London, United Kingdom (16,784.1m)

5) Paris, France (15,200.0m)

6) Macau Macau 14,268.5m

7) New York City 11,850.4m

8) Shenzhen 11,702.5m

9) Kuala Lumpur 11,182.4m

10) Antalya 11,120.7m

Turkey features strongly in the list, with Antalya, Istanbul and Artvin all enjoying an increase in visitor from last year largely thanks to an influx of Russian arrivals. 

Antalya, which boasts beach destinations including Kemer, Alanya, Belek, Kas and Side, accounted for 75 per cent of all Russian visitors to Turkey who can enter the country without a visa if staying less than 60 days. 

Switzerland's largest city, Zurich, boasts one of Europe's highest growth rates for arrivals with a rise of 23.6 per cent - it welcomed 2.26m arrivals in 2013 with more Chinese and Russian visitors credited as the main reason.  

While Chinese and Russian travellers are having a huge impact on the list, Euromonitor believe the United States,  the second largest source for outbound travel in 2013, is the market to watch.

The US has been a relatively mature market with outbound travel peaking in 2007, followed by yearly declines until recovery began in 2012. 

But a better economic environment, a stronger dollar and lower gas prices will likely boost outbound travel from the US.

'Cities in neighboring countries to the US such as Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean will most likely see growth in US travelers,' says Euromonitor's Head of Travel and Tourism, Caroline Bremner.

'Western European cities will likely benefit too, thanks to strong cultural positioning and historical ties to the US.'

The figures were released as the latest UNWTO World Tourism Barometer revealed international tourist arrivals reached 1,138 million in 2014, a 4.7 per cent increase on last year.

Despite no countries from the Continent cracking the top three cities in terms of arrivals, Europe is the most visited region with over half of the world’s international tourists with a total of 588m visitors, an increase of 22m.
