The eyes of the world will fall on Glasgow today when the opening ceremony of the 20th Commonwealth Games takes place.

The spectacle, described by organisers as the most prestigious live event ever seen in Scotland, is being held at Celtic Park in the east of the host city.

A global television audience of more than one billion people is expected to tune in to watch the events unfold.

But ahead of the event, athletes took time out from their training to meet the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall on the eve of the competition.

Charles and Camilla spoke to boxing hopefuls, badminton players and cyclists during a visit to the Emirates Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome.

The Queen, as head of the 
Commonwealth, will attend today's ceremony with the Duke of Edinburgh to 
formally open the 2014 sporting spectacle.

The ceremony will be the first big test of Glasgow’s ambition to host the greatest Commonwealth Games of all time.

While
 organisers have kept much of the detail of the launch close to their 
chest, they have promised it will have a distinctly Glaswegian accent.

Singers Rod Stewart, Susan Boyle and Amy Macdonald are among those performing in front of a live audience of 40,000 spectators.

Organisers
 say the ceremony will show people around the world ‘what we’re made of’
 in Scotland, whilst celebrating values of unity and diversity.

In
 an unprecedented move, the opening ceremony will also feature a 
Commonwealth-wide fundraiser for children, thanks to a partnership with 
children’s organisation Unicef.

Nicole
 Scherzinger, Sir Chris Hoy and Sir Alex Ferguson are among those 
promised to appear ‘as never seen before’, in footage exploring 
different regions of the Commonwealth to witness Unicef’s work.

More
 traditional elements seen over the decades at Commonwealth Games 
opening ceremonies will also be present in tonight’s launch.

The ceremonial flag will be hoisted at 
the opening of the Games, where it will fly continuously throughout the 
event until it is lowered at the closing ceremony.

There will also be a parade of the athletes from the 71 participating nations and territories of the Commonwealth.

Sheffield’s
 Nick Matthew, a multiple squash world champion, will lead Team England 
into the Games after being named as the squad’s flag bearer, while 
rhythmic gymnast Francesca Jones has been handed the honour for the 
Welsh team.

Judo’s Euan Burton will lead Team Scotland into the opening ceremony of their home Games.

During
 the ceremony, the Queen will read out the message that was hidden 
inside the Commonwealth Games baton while it journeyed around the world.

She
 sent the symbol of the Games on its trip across the 71 nations and 
territories at a ceremony at Buckingham Palace in October and it 
returned to Glasgow on Sunday.

It was Manchester 2002 when the people who ran Scotland’s biggest city and Commonwealth Games council started believing they could put on their own show.

But
 the work really began towards the end of 2007 when the west of Scotland
 city was confirmed as the host for the 2014 Games, beating Abuja, the 
Nigerian capital.

Since then the London Olympics has given Glasgow further inspiration, but a lot to live up to.

Michael Cavanagh, the Commonwealth 
Games Scotland chairman, said: ‘What we are about to deliver in Glasgow,
 I think, will be the best ever Commonwealth Games, for sure.

‘We have learned from Manchester and particularly London 2012, but we are ready to deliver something spectacular.’

The road to Glasgow 2014 has had some hitches along the way.

A
 plan to demolish five unoccupied tower blocks - the city’s iconic Red 
Road flats - during the opening ceremony was scrapped after a furore 
over the message it was sending out and the impact on the sixth tower’s 
residents.

But Glaswegians and Scots in general 
look set to embrace the prospect of the first Commonwealth Games in 
their country for 28 years, with more than 1.1 million tickets sold.

First Minister Alex Salmond believes the impact of the Glasgow 2014 Games will be felt in Scotland for generations to come.

He said they will ‘showcase the great 
strengths of modern Scotland’ as he pointed to their ability to serve as
 a catalyst for greater international trade, investment and tourism.

With a nod to Glasgow’s renowned warm spirit, he said: ‘The Commonwealth Games traditionally are known as the friendly Games.

‘The whole of Glasgow, the whole of Scotland, is determined to ensure that these Games live up to that billing and that they become recognised as the friendliest Games and the finest Games ever.’

When the sporting action gets under way tomorrow, more than 4,500 sports men and women will compete in events across 17 sports until August 3.

On the move: Scotland football manager Gordon Strachan carries the Queen's Baton through Mount Florida in Glasgow last week

The Queen's baton will reach its final destination at the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games after a journey of more than 120,000 miles.

The baton has travelled through 70 nations and territories since it was sent on its way by the Queen at Buckingham Palace last October.

The unique hand-crafted baton, made of titanium, wood and granite, has been carried by tens of thousands around the globe during its epic 248-day tour around the Commonwealth.

It visited Asia, Oceania, Africa, North and South America, the Caribbean and Europe before returning to the UK and finally to Scotland.

Baton-bearers have included top athletes and celebrities such as Britain's most successful Olympian Sir Chris Hoy, diver Tom Daley and singer Susan Boyle.

But thousands more ‘local champions’ have also held aloft the symbol of the Glasgow Games on its journey.

Its final lap took the baton the length and breadth of Scotland for 40 days, with 4,000 bearers joining in the nation's biggest ever relay in more than 400 communities.

The baton arrived in Glasgow on Sunday, and will be handed back to the Queen at the opening ceremony at Celtic Park tonight.

There the Queen will officially begin the Games by reading aloud her message of support to Commonwealth athletes, which she placed inside the baton at the start of its journey.

The secret note was written during a summer stay at her Scottish retreat of Balmoral and was housed in a transparent cylinder within the baton's pure titanium lattice-work frame.

The relay is a tradition that started in 1958, and symbolises the gathering of people from across the Commonwealth.

It shares similarities with the Olympic torch relay, but there is only one baton rather than the hundreds of torches used to carry the Olympic flame.
