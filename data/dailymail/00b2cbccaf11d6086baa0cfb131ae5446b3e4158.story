An Indian farmer has decided not to sell his prized bull it fetched a world record price of £1.23million because he already earns more than £30,000 a month selling its highly-sought after semen.

If Karamvir Singh had gone ahead with the sale, it would have made his three-year-old bull, called Bheem Donor, the most expensive in the world.

But after selling off the bull's brother, Yuvi Donor, for the equivalent of £860,000, Mr Singh is not in a rush to get rid of the 1,200kg bull.

The Murrah breed bull would provide plenty of meat, but his real value comes from the 4 to 5ml of high quality semen he produces every day, which is in demand across the country.

Mr Singh, who lives in Sunario village located in the Kurukshetra region of Northern India's Haryana State, said: 'I don't see the need to rush into selling him given that I can earn over £30,000 a month from selling his semen.'

He also makes a similar amount from the bull that fathered Bheem.

He added that Bheem Donor was 'like a son to him' - and a very profitable one.

The 1,200kg Murrah breed bull produces 4 to 5ml of semen a day, which earns Mr Singh £30,000 a month

The bull consumes around £20 worth of food every day, but it's a worthwhile investment as its breed is known for selling for high prices

One of the reasons that semen from the family is so expensive is due to the fact that the mother of Bheem and Yuvi, produces up to 26litres of milk every day - a record-breaking amount for a Murrah buffalo. 

But while Mr Singh regularly brings in a small fortune from the bull, it consumes around £20 worth of food every day. 

This is a considerable amount considering the monthly wage for many people in rural communities across the country is around £100.

The auction took place at a three-day fair organised in Jagraon by the Progressive Dairy Farmers' Association. 

The Murrah breed of Water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) is a type of domestic water buffalo kept for dairy production.

They originate from the Punjab and Haryana states of India and Pakistan and are jet black in colour, have closely curled horns and sometimes have white markings on their face and legs. 

The bulls are used for improving the milk productivity of dairy buffaloes, usually through artificial insemination.

Murrah bulls are widely used in countries like Bulgaria, Italy and Egypt and the breed is noted for the fact that animals sell for such high prices.
