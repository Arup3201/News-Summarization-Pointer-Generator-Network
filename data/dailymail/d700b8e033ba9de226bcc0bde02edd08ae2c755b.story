A morbidly obese veterinary secretary has lost the same weight as a baby elephant on a drastic diet.

Kim Stock, 41, from Aylesbury, Bucks, weighed in at 26st 8lb and was too embarrassed about her size to go on holiday.

Worried she wouldn't fit on the plane, at just 5ft 4" in height Kim was a size 32 and had a dangerous BMI of 65.

But now, Kim has been on a plane for the first time in a decade after shedding more than 15 stone.

Kim from Aylesbury, Bucks, celebrated with her first flight abroad for 10 years last year with her fiance, system administrator Peter Nelson, 35.

She said: 'The thought of asking for an extension to go around me or touching some stranger next to me because I overflowed the edges of my seat was mortifying, and the looks that this would accompany this stopped me from flying.

'This meant that I never had a chance to say goodbye to my nanny, who lived in Australia, in person - sadly, she died last year. She was my number one fan and followed my weight-loss progress with a keen eye.

'I've just had my first flight abroad to Portugal with my fiance, and it wasn't scary at all. There was loads of room in my seatbelt. I even took pictures to prove it.'

Before her weight loss Kim was a size 32 and her BMI was a dangerous 65.

But now she has lost nearly 16 stone, weighing 11 stone and fitting into a size 10.

Kim said: 'People used to shout at me in the street. School boys would offer me "more cake", things like that.

Kim was told one of the reasons she was struggling to fall pregnant was because of her weight

She wanted to lose weight to get married and be able to walk the dog without getting tired before he does

'I was stuck in a vicious cycle. I would hide indoors and eat away the pain of being hated by random strangers.

'I had tried all sorts of diets in my 20s and early 30s but I never had the motivation to really stick with it.'

Kim had always been a big child - a size 16 at just 16-years-old - and tried every diet growing up, but nothing worked and her weight continued to go up.

She said: 'I tried all sorts - from calorie counting to the cabbage soup diet - and everything in between.

'I had some success but I could never get the motivation to stick with it.'

In November 2011 Kim made a list of the reasons she wanted to lose weight, including wanting to get married and walking the dog without getting tired before he does.

She went for a chat with her GP and decided to go on the Cambridge Weight Plan.

Kim recently won the award for Biggest Loser at the Cambridge Weight Plan awards.

Now she is making the most of being able to do simple tasks that others take for granted.

Kim said: 'The first time I went into a high street shop at my current size, I picked something up thinking "there's no way this will fit me", but it did.

'I had to take it off and put it back on again twice just to believe it.

'It feels great to be buying clothes in mainstream stores that don't cater exclusively for larger sized people.

Breakfast - Two bowls of cereal, muesli or porridge

Lunch - Sandwiches, pies, samosas or a jacket potato with chilli and cheese

Dinner - Spaghetti bolognese, lasagne, curry

Snacks - Chocolate and crisps

Breakfast - portion of porridge

Lunch - Soup

Dinner - Chicken with salad

Snacks - An apple

'It's simple things that other people take for granted, like working on my garden and even just having a bath - I couldn't fit before so always had to have a shower.

'I lost the weight so quickly it look me a while to get used to being this size. I still struggle to pick out clothes that suit me so often a friend of mine will come too and help style me.'

She says going on holiday wasn't scary at all, and she had plenty of room in her seatbelt
