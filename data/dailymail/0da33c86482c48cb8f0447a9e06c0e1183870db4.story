A housewife has admitted she feels 'like a monster' after a botched boob job has left her with horrifically disfigured breasts.

Debbie, 50, from L.A. had the surgery 15 years ago when she was trying to further her career in the adult entertainment industry.

'Being large and more voluptuous was the epitome of glamour to me,' she said explaining why she wanted to increase her chest size five times to a J cup.

Bigger isn't better: Debbie has been left with lopsided breasts after surgery to boost her to a J cup went wrong, left. She had the op when she was 35, right, and hoping to further her career in the adult entertainment industry

A week after the surgery, she developed a painful infection in her right breast and the surgeon who did her operation was nowhere to be found.

She was then seen by other doctors who agreed to perform surgery to have the implant and infected skin removed.

However, the doctors only operated on the infected right breast, leaving Debbie with one huge J size breast and one smaller breast without implants.

Longs to be normal again: Debbie meets Mr Vik Vijh who believes there is hope she can have corrective surgery

'It looks like someone hacked me up,' she said. 'When I look in the mirror I see this grotesque image, I feel like a monster. I haven't found a surgeon willing or able to help me.'

Ordeal: The housewife was left with her 'hacked up' figure after one of 
her breasts became infected and the implants had to be removed

Without any hope of a corrective operation, Debbie, who lives with supportive partner Billy, became a virtual recluse for 15 years.

But now help could be at hand after she applied to take part in new UK TV show Last Chance Salon.

'If someone can help me it will change my world and help me feel like a new person,' she said.

On the show, she meets cosmetic expert Mr Vik Vijh, one of Britain's leading plastic surgeons.

He
believes Debbie can be operated on but it will take multiple operations
where all the implants in her left breast are removed.

Debbie
meets Dr Vijh in the first episode of the show that airs on Thursday 2 
May on new channel TLC.

He refers her to a U.S. doctor who is willing to
take her case as long as she agrees to get herself into shape for the 
intense surgery by quitting smoking.

The series will follow Debbie on her journey as she admits 'I just want to be normal again'.

Last Chance Salon begins Thursday 2 May at 10pm on new entertainment channel TLC (Sky 125 and Virgin 167)
