Cosmetic cowboys with no medical training will remain free to inject women with ‘backstreet Botox’ because health Ministers have bowed to pressure to leave the industry largely unregulated.

The Mail on Sunday has learnt that the Government is to reject a crucial recommendation in a hard-hitting review of the booming sector, to the outrage of leading doctors.

This newspaper has been campaigning since March for far tougher regulation of the industry. The Mail on Sunday has called for measures including a minimum standard for surgeons; proper regulation for all those practising cosmetic surgery; and an end to the hard-sell tactics that see special offers and glossy advertising undermine the seriousness of the procedures involved.

Ministers have bowed to pressure and will leave the industry largely unregulated

Ministers are worried that regulating the £3 billion industry will constrain it in the run-up to the 2015 Election – a period during which they want unfettered economic growth.

But doctors and campaigners believe people’s health could be put seriously at risk.

When the review was published in April, Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter said he agreed entirely with the principles behind its recommendations. A key proposal was the creation of a compulsory register for everyone carrying out cosmetic treatments – including Botox injections, use of wrinkle-smoothing dermal fillers, and laser hair-removal treatments.

A crackdown on so-called 'backstreet Botox' is to be shelved over fears that it could harm the economy

At the moment these can be carried out by anyone – sometimes with horrifying results.

But this newspaper has been told that the Department for Business has insisted that any register should be voluntary – meaning ‘cosmetic cowboys’ will be able to operate as normal.

‘Non-surgical cosmetic interventions’ account for three-quarters of the value of the cosmetics industry and the vast majority of growth in the sector, which will be worth £3.6 billion by 2015 having grown five-fold in a decade.

Science writer and broadcaster Vivienne Parry, who sat on the cosmetics review panel, said the lack of a mandatory register was ‘outrageous’.

Describing the Government’s expected response as ‘utterly appalling’, Ms Parry said: ‘It means people’s lives will continue to be put at risk.

‘We are heading for a public health disaster, just because it fits in with the Government’s growth agenda. I believe there’s an element of chauvinism here, a mindset that ‘‘these are stupid people having these treatments and it’s their own fault if things go wrong’’.’

NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh was asked to lead the cosmetics review in the wake of the PIP breast implants scandal, which led to thousands of British women having them taken out.

Last night Sir Bruce said he would be dismayed if the Government decided against firm regulation. And Rajiv Grover, president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic  Surgeons, said a mandatory register was essential.

Marcelle King, 58, is one of those who has suffered from ‘backstreet Botox’. She ended up in casualty after being injected with what she believes was fake Botox by a man purporting to be a plastic surgeon. The ‘treatment’ took place in a friend’s kitchen.

Mrs King, a dog trainer from Poole in Dorset, suffered a severe allergic reaction and said: ‘I could have died. The police still don’t know what I was injected with – it could have  been knocked up in someone’s bathtub.

‘I will be very disappointed if the Government fails to regulate – it’s all about money isn’t it? Has someone got to die before they do anything serious about it?’

Critics claim the cosmetics industry has determinedly  lobbied Ministers to stop short of a mandatory register. Firms have funded a body called Treatments You Can Trust, which launched a voluntary register of ‘qualified cosmetic injectable providers’  in 2010.
