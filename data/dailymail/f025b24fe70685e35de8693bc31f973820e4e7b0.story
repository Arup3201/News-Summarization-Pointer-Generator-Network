The Government must act to stop motorists who fill up their cars at garages and drive off without paying, fuel industry chiefs warn.

The Petrol Retailers Association says that the problem of 'drive-offs' is reaching 'epidemic levels', and says ministers must do something to help petrol stations, rather than leaving it to the police to deal with.

The AA also says that the problem has recently intensified, and says two groups of people are responsible: those who simply cannot afford to pay rising petrol prices, and organised gangs who steal fuel on a large scale.

The number of motorists who drive off from petrol stations without paying is reaching 'epidemic' levels, industry chiefs warn

PRA chairman Brian Madderson told the Daily Telegraph: 'Fuel theft has reached epidemic levels.

'Retailers can do as much as they can - write down number plates, install CCTV - but the police are saying that before they enter it into their records as a criminal offence we have got to prove evidence of criminal intent by the motorist.

'That's near impossible.'

Last week a forecourt manager in Kent
was critically injured after trying to stop people driving away from 
his petrol station without paying.

Lekshmanan Asokkumar, 58, was hurt 
while trying to write down the numberplate of a car driven by suspected 
fuel thieves at the Texaco garage he manages in West Kingsdown, Kent.

His son said the car drove into him, 
leaving Mr Asokkumar clinging on to the wipers for 200 yards before he 
was thrown from the speeding car onto the side of the road.

Last week a 19-year-old man and a 16-year-old girl were arrested in Chatham, Kent, on suspicion of attempted murder.Â

A spokesman for the AA told 
MailOnline: 'We have always seen drive-offs over many years but now the 
scale of them has intensified.

'There
are two types of people involved: desperate people who are finding the 
cost of fuel too great and have to resort to desperate measures to stay 
mobile, and organised crime gangs who steal anything that is expensive, 
like fuel.'

He said the 
latter type tended not to steal petrol because it was too volatile to 
handle, but would steal diesel, either by filling drums inside a van or 
even by using small tankers.

'Earlier this year there was a spate of fuel thefts and we are not talking hundreds of litres, we are talking thousands of litres.'

Going up: Fuel prices have soared in the last few years, making it an attractive target for thieves

The AA spokesman said that petrol station managers did use numberplate recognition, CCTV cameras, and spoke to each other about which vehicles to look out for, but said none of this was any use if thieves used stolen numberplates to cover their own.

Recently gangs have gone to petrol stations when they were closed and prised fuel reservoirs open before helping themselves.

Fuel prices are at near-record levels, with unleaded costing an average 137.22p a litre and diesel 141.51p a litre.

Last month the AA warned that fuel prices were set to soar over the summer because of rising wholesale costs and the weakness of the pound against the dollar.
