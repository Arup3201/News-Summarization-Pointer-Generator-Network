A Canadian YouTube user has posted a video of what he claims is the 'world's ugliest Christmas sweater', which features a working toy train set and colorful festive lights. 

The sweater is showcased in a newly-released video by YouTuber bd594 and was made using a knitted sweatshirt found at Goodwill which the anonymous Canadian accessorized using a variety of over-the-top festive decorations, including a toy train set and snowy scenery, and a string of colored festive lights. 

And as if that wasn't enough, the video also highlights a variety of other functions for the quirky knitted creation, including using the train set scenery to serve drinks at a party or wearing the warm sweater while out walking your dog.

The ultimate upcycle: YouTube user bd594 created the 'world's ugliest Christmas sweater' using a knitted sweatshirt he found at Goodwill

How handy: The Canadian highlights a variety of other functions for the sweater, including using it as a drinks tray

bd594's festive upcycle video will no doubt serve as inspiration to anyone out there who is eager to create their own ugly Christmas sweater at home, rather than shelling out upwards of $50 for the more fashionable options currently available in stores like Target, Macy's and Nordstrom. 

This holiday season has already seen a huge increase in the number of ugly Christmas sweaters being sold - and bought - throughout the US. 

Last week, fashion website Rent the Runway announced that it has launched a Christmas sweater hire scheme, which enables customers to rent ugly festive knitwear for the bargain price of $15 for four days, rather than splashing out and buying their own. 

The website's Christmas capsule collection features 12 different vintage designs, ranging from the awkwardly traditional to the over-the-top ridiculous, with one sweater even featuring a 3D puppet which had been sewn onto the front of it.

Going into detail: The scenery featured on the sweater is incredibly ornate - and festive

WARNING: bd594's video comes complete with a number of cautions for anyone who dares to try and recreate the sweater themselves

But nothing in Rent the Runway's selection - nor indeed in any other ugly sweater retailer's collections - quite compares with bd594's creation. 

Wearing such an ornately-decorated sweater does have its drawbacks however, as the YouTuber makes sure to point out in his video with a number of clearly-demonstrated warnings. 

'Caution!!! When wearing outdoors,' one clip says, while another, no doubt aimed at any holiday party-goers, advises: 'When drinking remember not to put your sweater on backwards.' 

The sweater has certainly proved popular with bd594's YouTube viewers, many of whom have been quick to congratulate the video maker on his festive innovation.
