It's about the size of a simple two-bedroom apartment, only without any windows, refrigeration, plants or, most importantly, the ability to venture outside without a space suit.

And six researchers who have been living in a Mars simulation for the last four months in Hawaii have been able to finally leave the solar-powered dome and return to the real world.

The research mission on the Mauna Loa volcano ended 120 days of the Red Plant exploration as part of the second Hawaii Space Exploration Analog & Simulation mission, known as HI-SEAS, according to ABC News.

The 1,000-square-foot mock planet station features a kitchen, dining room, bathroom, lab and exercise space, as well as six small bedrooms.

The 1,000-square-foot solar-powered dome was created as a test to see how well astronauts could live on Mars for an extended amount of time

'I haven't seen a tree, smelled the train, heard a bird, or felt wind on my skin in four months,' Expedition leader Casey Stedman posted on his Instagram account.

Perhaps what the team were most excited about however was real food.

They have been living off dehydrated meals for the entire mission.

'It's really great to taste fresh fruit and vegetables again,' Stedman told ABC News.

'The main purpose of the project is to learn about the problems that might occur to crew members if they went to Mars' Kimberly Binsted, principal investigator of the project, told ABC News.

Another major part of the process was learning to handle conflicts, depression and anxiety in a confined space, as astronauts would have to constantly do.

'It's not like if you have a problem with someone, you can go out for a run in a park on Mars,' Binsted said.

'You have to get along with each other in a very small space.'

HI-SEAS 2 was run by the University of Hawaii at Manoa and funded by NASA's Human Research Program

Surprisingly, Stedman said everyone got along fairly well.

'There weren't really altercations among the crew,' Stedman said.

'But even in a family vacation, you disagree with someone over something.'

The astronauts would only venture outside in mock space suits and would treat the expedition as if they were actually on Mars.

HI-SEAS is a test to see what life would be like on Mars for astronauts staying on the planet for an extended period of time.

The team entered the dome on March 28.

HI-SEAS 2 is run by the University of Hawaii at Manoa and funded by NASA's Human Research Program.

The first mission finished up after a 118-day stint in August last year.

Mars is the main long-term goal of NASA's human spaceflight program, according to NBC.

The agency aims to get astronauts to the vicinity of the Red Planet by the mid-2030s.
