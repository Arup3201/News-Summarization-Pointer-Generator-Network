Distress: Amanda Hutton, pictured outside court yesterday, wept as a pathologist spoke of finding her 'mummified' son

The mummified corpse of a four-year-old boy who starved to death was found in a cot cuddling his favourite soft toy, a jury heard.

Hamzah Khan was found by a policeman in a severe state of decay more than two years after he had died.

His body had been kept upstairs by his mother Amanda Hutton, who continued to claim child benefit, and is now on trial at Bradford Crown Court for the manslaughter of her son.

Hutton, who wept in the dock for 40 minutes while a pathologist described her son's decayed and malnourished body, yesterday told the court that the boy had starved himself to death.

Pathologist Dr Matthew Lyall described to jurors how he was called to examine Hamzah, who weighed less than when he was born, and found evidence that he was malnourished for two years before his death in 2009.

He was called to Hutton's terraced house in Bradford, Yorkshire, in September 2011. Jurors later heard how the property was covered in flies and exuded a stench 'almost beyond description'.

Dr Lyall said: 'He was lying supine - on his back - accompanied by a soft toy which his right arm was encircling. He was severely decomposed and mummified.'

The pathologist said Hamzah was clothed in a babygro for an infant aged six to nine months, and even that was ‘slightly too big for the child’s body.'

He said the boy was mummified, having decomposed in dry conditions, with leathery skin and tight, rigid limbs.

The child’s body weighed just 4lbs 5oz, his bones were visible beneath the skin, and his duvet was coated in maggots, pupae cases and insects. Flea eggs were on
the child’s hands and head.

He agreed there was an “abundant” amount of insects and flies.

He said a Hamzah was also wearing a T-shirt for a three or four year old which was 'much too large'.

He said he could not be sure of a precise cause of death due to the level of decay, but that all evidence pointed to starvation.

'It seems reasonable to conclude Hamzah Khan was suffering from malnutrition and entirely possible that malnutrition or dehydration could have contributed or, in part, caused his death.'

'Irrespective of the cause of malnutrition I would expect a competent parent to recognise the severe growth retardation evident in the child and seek medical assistance.'

The court heard Hamzah was registered with a GP 15 months after he was born but he never saw a doctor before his death.

A host of experts examined Hamzah’s teeth, hair and bones, and all showed signs of malnourishment.

Prof Archibald Malcolm, a histopathologist specialising in bones, found Hamzah was suffering ‘profound’ osteoporosis and said there was no credible explanation other than malnutrition.

Forensic anthropologist Dr Julie Roberts evidence Hamzah’s bones of ‘extreme stunting of growth’, which had left the child with the skeleton of a child aged between 12 and 18 months.

Paediatric dietician Jacqueline Lowdon said Hamzah’s diet had been ‘grossly inadequate.’

Earlier the court heard Hutton did nothing to alert the emergency services about her son's plight and even ordered pizza within hours of his death, Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, told the court.

Hamzah's body was found in September 2011 after police community support officer Jodie Worsley went to the house on a number of occasions due to concerns raised by neighbours.

The court heard how there was terrible smell coming from the terraced house and, when Hutton eventually opened the door, there were flies buzzing around her.

Police went into the property and 'what they discovered disturbed even hardened officers,' Mr Greaney said.

The prosecutor said Hutton was an abuser of alcohol and cannabis and had been subjected to violence by Hamzah's father, Aftab Khan, who lived away from the home.

In police interviews Hutton said her son had become particularly unwell on December 14, 2009 and died the next day.

She told police that things deteriorated after her son's death and she began to drink a bottle of vodka a day.

Her house contained a huge amount of rubbish, rotting matter, faeces and empty bottles and smell 'almost beyond description,' the jury have heard.

The prosecution say Hutton was guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence on two grounds - that she failed to feed him adequately and failed to seek medical assistance for him.

Jurors will hear further medical evidence tomorrow before Hutton takes to the witness box in her own defence on Monday.
