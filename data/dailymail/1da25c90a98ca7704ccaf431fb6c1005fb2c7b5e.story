The Duchess of Cornwall wore a regal shade of dark blue to attend the National Harvest Service in Birmingham.

Beaming from under a matching velvet hat the 67-year-old met dignitaries and clergy outside St Philip's Cathedral before heading inside where she was greeted by schoolchildren who showed her their harvest boxes of food which will be sent to the Birmingham Central Food Bank for distribution. 

The Duchess of Cornwall looked resplendent in a blue ruffled dress which she paired with a matching velvet hat, and her favourite pearl necklace.

The fashion conscious Duchess gave the outfit a more youthful twist by adding a white collar and cuffs.

She was seen speaking to dignitaries and receiving bunches of flowers from local children before going inside for the ceremony.

A group of 360 schoolchildren then took centre stage as they presented the Royal with their harvest boxes - filled with home-grown produce.

The cathedral also welcomed the new 'Harvest Torch' - a symbolic sculpture which will pass from host city to host city.

At the end of the service, the harvest boxes were collected by a historic horse-drawn trolley and taken to the Birmingham Central Food Bank for distribution.

The National Harvest Service was first held at Westminster Abbey last year and is being held as part of Love British Food's campaign to rekindle marking the harvest.

Before the service Camilla was also introduced to some local farm animals, and appeared to give a jokey warning to a goat during the tour of the pens – eight years after she was attacked by one which tried to grab her handbag.

The Duchess of Cornwall famously wrestled the bag back from a nanny in May 2006 when the animal tried to snatch it from her on a visit to a creamery in Northern Ireland.

The Duchess looked understandably a tad skeptical as she was taken for a closer inspection of the goats by farmer Richard Craddock (left) from Hatton Adventure World 

But yesterday, the Duchess made sure she kept a safer distance when she spotted the animals outside Birmingham Cathedral and gave her handbag to a minder.

Camilla was taken for a closer inspection of the goats by farmer Richard Craddock from Hatton Adventure World.

She was spotted leaning over to look at the animals who were in a metal-fenced pen.

Despite her 2006 'attack' the Duchess was brave enough to bend down to greet the horned farm animals- though having ensured her handbag was at a safe distance 

She seemed in good spirits and she greeted the waiting crowds and examined the impressive harvest displays of flowers and fresh produce, despite her previous bad goat experience . 

Mr Craddock, manager of Hatton Adventure World, near Warwick, said: 'Camilla seemed very comfortable with the animals.

'She said to me 'the goats are very quiet' and seemed quite pleased they were subdued.

'She seemed amazed how quiet they were and even tried to feed one some straw but it didn't seem that interested.

'Camilla told me she was an animal lover herself. She was very pleasant and spoke to everyone she could.'

The Duchess was visiting Fivemiletown Creamery, near Brookeborough in Northern Ireland, with Prince Charles she was attacked by the goat in 2006.

But she saw the funny side after the nanny tried to wrestle her handbag away and said:

'She just wants to join the party.'

And after patting the kid goats, the royal added: 'They are terribly sweet - and they do such a good job of mowing the lawn.'
