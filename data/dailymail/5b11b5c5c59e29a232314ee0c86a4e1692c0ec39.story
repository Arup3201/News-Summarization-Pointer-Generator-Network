To onlookers, Monsignor Kevin Wallin's fall from grace at his Connecticut parish was like something out of 'Breaking Bad,' the television series about a high school chemistry teacher who becomes a methamphetamine lord.

The suspended Roman Catholic priest was arrested on federal drug charges this month for allegedly having methamphetamine mailed to him from co-conspirators in California and making more than $300,000 in drugs sales out of his apartment in Waterbury in the second half of last year.

Along the way, authorities said, he bought a small adult video and sex toy shop in the nearby town of North Haven named 'Land of Oz & Dorothy's Place,' apparently to launder all the money he was making.

Breaking bad: Since the arrest, Wallin, left, has been compared to Walter White from the show Breaking BadÂ 

He has pleaded not guilty, and jury selection in his trial is scheduled to begin March 21.

On social media sites, people couldn't help but compare Wallin with Walter White, the main character on 'Breaking Bad' who was making so much cash that he and his wife bought a car wash to launder their profits.

He has also been dubbed in some media as 'Monsignor Meth.'

Wallin, 61, was the pastor of St. Augustine Parish in Bridgeport for nine years until he resigned in June 2011, citing health and personal problems. He previously served six years as pastor of St. Peter's Church in Danbury until 2002.

He was granted a sabbatical in July 2011. The Diocese of Bridgeport suspended him from public ministry last May.

Diocesan officials become concerned about Wallin in the spring of 2011 after complaints about his appearance and erratic behavior, diocese spokesman Brian Wallace told the Connecticut Post.

Some reports of his behavior were startling.

'We became aware that he was acting 
out sexually - with men - in the church rectory,' Wallace told the 
newspaper, adding that church officials deemed the sexual behavior 
unbecoming of a priest and asked Wallin to resign.

'News of Monsignor Kevin Wallin's 
arrest comes with a sense of shock and concern on the part of the 
diocese and the many people of Fairfield County who have known him as a 
gifted, accomplished and compassionate priest,' the diocese said in a 
statement. 'We ask for 
prayers for Monsignor Wallin during the difficult days ahead for him.'

Wallin's arrest called attention to 
larger problems within the church, said Voice of the Faithful in the 
Diocese of Bridgeport, one of many local chapters of the lay 
organization formed in response to the sexual abuse crisis in the 
church.

'Catholics have to ask whether the 
mandatory obligation of celibacy imposes a harmful burden on priests and
 whether women ought to be admitted to the priesthood,' the group said 
in a statement.

'The steady decline in the number of priests, the aging 
of priests, the terrible sin of pedophilia among priests, and the 
downfall of Monsignor Wallin are all signs of a sickness in the 
priesthood. It is time to seek a remedy for this awful malady that 
threatens the Eucharist, the center of Catholic life.'

Elizabeth Badjan, a member of the St.
 Augustine congregation, told The New York Times that Wallin needed the 
prayers of parishioners.

'This is all the work of evil,' she 
said as she left Mass last weekend. 'He was not close enough to God. He 
was tempted by the devil.'

Wallin's case has drawn comparisons 
to that of the Rev. Ted Haggard, a well-known evangelical megachurch 
pastor in Colorado who was forced out of his job in 2006 after a male 
escort alleged Haggard had paid him for sex and bought crystal meth.

The priest and four others were arrested for allegedly conspiring to distribute crystal meth

Federal agents arrested Wallin on Jan. 3, and a grand jury indicted him and four other people on drug charges on Jan. 15.

All are charged with one count of 
conspiracy to distribute 500 grams or more of a substance containing 
methamphetamine and 50 grams of actual methamphetamine, a crime that 
carries 10 years to life in prison upon conviction.

Wallin is also charged with six counts of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine.

Last July, Drug Enforcement 
Administration agents in New York told agents in the New Haven office 
that there was an unidentified Connecticut-based drug trafficker 
distributing methamphetamine in the region.

Wallin allegedly bought the Land of OZ sex shop to launder his drug money

Two months later, an informant told 
the DEA that the trafficker was Wallin, according to an affidavit by 
agent Jay Salvatore in New Haven.

The Connecticut Statewide Narcotics Task Force was also investigating Wallin.

Authorities said an undercover 
officer with the state task force bought methamphetamine from Wallin six
 times from Sept. 20 to Jan. 2, paying more than $3,400 in total for 23 
grams of the drug.

Federal agents also say they learned through wiretaps and informants about other sales Wallin was making.

Connecticut U.S. Attorney David Fein 
said federal and state authorities worked together in 'the dismantling 
of what we allege was a significant methamphetamine distribution 
organization that spanned from California to Connecticut.'

Also charged in the case were Kenneth
 Devries, 52, of Waterbury; Michael Nelson, 40, of Manchester; Chad 
McCluskey, 43, of San Clemente, Calif.; and Kristen Laschober, 47, of 
Laguna Niguel, Calif. Authorities say McCluskey and Laschober were 
involved in the shipping of methamphetamine to Wallin.

Wallin faces up to 20 years behind bars and a $2million fine if convicted.
