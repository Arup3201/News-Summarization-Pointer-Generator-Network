Some sports fans take their favorite team's losses a little too hard.

Others, especially after a few beers, just take it out on their houses.

One Dallas Cowboys die-hard could not sit back and take the team's loss to Washington on Monday night, which dropped the team to 6-2 on the season.

Demolition site: A Dallas Cowboys fan starts to smash up his house - starting with the dining room table - after the team lost to the Washington Redskins on Monday night

The Cowboys were down by three in overtime and needed a first down to keep their drive going and keep their winning streak alive.

'You don't want to hear what I can do to this f------ place,' a young man in front of the television croaks ominously in the video posted to YouTube on Tuesday, which quickly went viral. 

Romo takes the snap and finds Dez Bryant on a corner route, but the ball is batted away by Bashaud Breeland. Cowboys lose.

The enraged fan gets up from in front of the TV and proceeds to smash up the place, knocking over tables and the kitchen counter. 

At one incredible point, the man even throws his fish tank to the floor of the kitchen and purple rocks spray across the floor.

The video leaves many questions unanswered. Where is the fish? Why save only the assorted beer bottle caps? Was it all a hoax pulled by roommates looking to remodel?

Not the fish!: As part of the destruction, the fish tank is knocked to the floor of the kitchen, spilling purple rocks and water everywhere

While the scene appears completely destructive, the man's friend's don't seem to care.

They can be heard and seen laughing as one of them films the whole outrage.

Afterwards the man announces he's 'going to bed.'
