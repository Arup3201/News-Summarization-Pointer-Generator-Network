Diners are queuing to sit at the same table where Charles Saatchi grabbed his wife Nigella Lawson by the throat and pulled at her nose.

Customers have allegedly been trying to book the same table where the assault happened at London's exclusive Scott's restaurant.

The pair's regular table outside the restaurant has become a macabre novelty for diners eager to photograph themselves in the same spot where the multi-millionaire held the 53-year-old by the throat and pulled her nose.

Diners are keen to sit at the table Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi, would regularly use when they dined at Scott's restaurant

Regular: Charles Saatchi at Scott's last night, where he has been so many times he has a special table and chair

The Mayfair restaurant has been 'inundated with requests', The Sun reported.

A source told The Sun: 'People are quite embarrassed to ask but it seems they want to get their picture taken as the spot where it all happened.'

Scott's were unavailable to comment when the Mail Online contacted them.

After the row in June, Miss Lawson ended her ten-year marriage to the art mogul this week on the grounds of his ‘unreasonable behaviour’ – in a hearing which lasted for just 70 seconds.

The couple were granted a decree nisi at the High Court in London on the grounds that the marriage had ‘irretrievably broken down’, less than eight weeks after they had a heated row which saw Mr Saatchi grabbing Miss Lawson's throat.

Mr Saatchi – who initially described the incident as a ‘playful tiff’ – has now accepted a police caution for assault.

Neither the 53-year-old television chef nor her art collector husband, 70, attended the hearing.

Starters:

Parma ham with fried goat's cheese, nectarines and hazelnut dressing - £12.75

Girolle, broad bean and samphire risotto - £13.75

Sautéed monkfish cheeks and snails with bacon and Bordelaise sauce - £14.75

Mains:

Monkfish and scallop brochette with fregola salad & harissa dressing - £25 Fillet of John Dory with sweetcorn and clam broth - £29.75

Desserts:

Oreo Chocolate with cookie ice cream - £9

Bakewell pudding with almond ice cream - £8.75

However papers lodged at the High Court revealed it was Miss Lawson who petitioned for the divorce.

She also answered ‘yes’ when asked if Mr Saatchi’s behaviour had continued.

Lawson, who was the applicant in the case, also confirmed in the document that they were living apart.

The document was signed by the popular cook and broadcaster on July 9.

The pair now have to wait for a decree absolute, which is usually issued six weeks and a day later, ending their marriage.

Neither the couple or their legal representatives attended the hearing.

A decree nisi is a statement saying the court sees no reason why a divorce cannot be granted.

It is thought the divorce will be rubber-stamped some time in September.

The pair, who are said to be worth an estimated £150million and shared a £12million home in Chelsea, are believed to have agreed never to publicly disclose the terms of the divorce or financial settlements.

They are also understood to have signed a pre-nuptial agreement when they wed in 2003.
