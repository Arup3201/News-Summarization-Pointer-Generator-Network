Stuart Lancaster has been urged to throw Danny Cipriani into the thick of the Six Nations action by picking him as England’s starting fly half.

The England head coach will on Wednesday name his team to face Wales in Friday night’s hotly anticipated opening Six Nations clash with Cipriani expected to be named on the bench and Bath star George Ford starting in the pivotal fly-half position.

But former team-mate Paul Sackey – a former England star who was part of Wasps 2007 European Cup winning team which included a teenage Cipriani – believes Lancaster should go one better and start the in-form No10.

Backs: Brown, Burrell, Cipriani, Ford, Joseph, May, Nowell, Twelvetrees, Watson, Wigglesworth, B.Youngs

Forwards: Attwood, Brookes, Cole, Croft, Easter, Hartley, Haskell, Kruis, Marler, Robshaw, Thomas, M.Vunipola, B.Vunipola, T.Youngs

‘I’m a massive Cipriani fan,’ Sackey told Sportsmail. ‘Attacking-wise I don’t think there is anyone better than him in England. It would be good for him to get a chance to show what he can do and reignite his career again.

‘His pace and his passing accuracy were the two things that stood out about him as a youngster. His passing was unbelievable. If you’ve got a 10 who can pass the ball and is a threat himself it opens options up all over the field.

‘He looks back to his best with a good team around him and it’s paying dividends. Sale are doing so well now and that’s paying massive dividends.

‘The recent New Zealand create so many holes is because of the threat Dan Carter poses. There are threats all over field. Danny can do that for England. He is such a huge talent.’

Cipriani, 27, spent six years in the international wilderness after falling out with former boss Martin Johnson following a spectacular introduction in 2008.

But his superb recent form for Sale has forced Lancaster to reconsider him, while Owen Farrell’s injury has opened the door further for a player Sackey recalls as one of the most exciting talents he ever played with.

‘He was always amazing in training but that was a great Wasps team with some special players,’ he said.

‘The thing that made you think ‘wow, he is amazing’ was the fact he came into that team at such a young age and fitted in straight away. He’s a special talent who still has a lot to offer England.’

With Ford expected to start ahead of Cipriani, with Jonathan Joseph at outside centre and Luther Burrell or Billy Twelvetrees at inside centre, Sackey says England will go far if they get their midfield right.

‘The 10-12-13 combination needs to be sorted out quickly,’ he said.

‘I liked Ford in the autumn. I thought he brought something different in terms of his attacking style and he’s quite cultured player who can kick to the corners. He brings another element to Farrell.

‘Manu Tuilagi is being missed and England really need to identify who they want to play in that midfield and stick with it. If it’s Burrell and Jamie Joseph then that’s a combination that can really work.

‘The pack of forwards is as good as anyone’s and if England can get their midfield sorted then I think they’ll be really dangerous.’
