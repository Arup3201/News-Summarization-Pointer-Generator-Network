It's only his second appearance at London Fashion Week but Hunter Original's Creative Director Alasdhair Willis has already cemented his show as one of the season's hottest tickets.

Stella McCartney's husband, who gives his wife a run for her money in the style stakes, unveiled his debut spring/summer collection before Sir Paul McCartney, Anna Wintour, Rita Ora and Mary Charteris, to name but a few.

But it wasn't just his front row that impressed. The digital native, in his continued commitment to innovation, collaborated with visual artist Mat Maitland to mastermind a film that complimented his show and was projected onto the runway creating quite the spectacle (and Instagram snaps aplenty).

It's raining men: Hunter Original sent models down the catwalk in cool outerwear in front of an impressive film projected onto the catwalk

Acting as a backdrop to the show, which was held on the site of an original swimming pool in West London, the film served as an extension of the collection and aimed to immerse the audience in a surreal underwater world celebrating our classic British summer.

Hate rain? Not anymore, thanks to Hunter's SS15 offering. We can already picture Kate Moss and Poppy Delevingne rocking the colour-block outerwear at next summer's festivals. 

Wearable outerwear: Models rocked khaki coats souped up with vibrant yellow and turquoise pockets -and it looks like sliders are here to stay

Willis' army: Stella McCartney's husband has done a stellar job (excuse the pun) since joining as Creative Director

Accessorise all areas: Shoes came with chunky rubber soles and were almost exclusively khaki green while bags were punctuated with Hunter's iconic logo and red rubber studs

Impressed? Anna Wintour occupied the front row and admired the pool sliders, which were updated for SS15 in new colourways such as mustard yellow

Khaki coats souped up with vibrant yellow and turquoise pockets (the coveted colours for SS15) were teamed with matching calf length socks and Hunter sliders (we bet Rita Ora had her eye on those). 

'The first Hunter Original SS15 collection explores contradictions born out of a quintessential British sense of eccentricity and quest to innovate,' said Willis.

'A central story to the collection is Dazzle, a revolutionary form of camouflage that is all about contradiction. It makes the object it is disguising even more visible but works by confusing the viewer through optical illusion and distorting depth of field.

'Invented by the pioneering British painter Norman Wilkinson, dazzle represents "twisted convention" and ultimately "innovation through creativity", both of which are core to the Hunter brand.' 

Bring on the showers.
