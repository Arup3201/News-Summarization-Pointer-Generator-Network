At a time when the likes of Apple and Samsung are pushing touchscreen smartwatches that look more like wrist-worn phones than classic timepieces, HP is taking a different route.

The California-based firm has partnered with fashion designer Michael Bastian to create a device that is a watch 'first and foremost.'

Dubbed MB Chronowing, the watch doesn’t have a touchscreen, camera, or microphone.

Instead, it primarily tells the time, while showing notifications discreetly from a Bluetooth-connected device.

HP has partnered with fashion designer Michael Bastian to create a device that is a watch first, and a gadget second. Dubbed MB Chronowing, the watch (pictured) doesn’t have a touchscreen, camera, or microphone. Instead, it primarily tells the time, while showing notifications discreetly from a Bluetooth-connected device

The gadget is expected to launch on Friday, on Gilt.com, with prices starting at $349 (£218) for a basic version, and $649 (£404) for a limited-edition black model.

Mr Bastian and the software giant unveiled the gadget last week, and have since released a video revealing more details about the device.

HP’s MB Chronowing connects via Bluetooth to an iPhone 4S and higher, or any Android device running 4.3 and above.

Made of stainless steel, the basic version has three interchangeable straps made of either brown leather, olive nylon, and black rubber. 

Notifications are shown in real-time. This includes emails, texts, calendar appointments, stock prices, game scores and more (pictured). Music on the phone can be controlled from the watch, too, using buttons on the side of the dial. The MB Chronowing additionally has a battery life of seven days, and is water resistant

‘As a men's designer, I'm very interested in all of the recent developments in the 'tech wearables' category - particularly smartwatches,’ explained Mr Bastian.

‘With the early devices I've seen, the design and feel of the watch takes a backseat to the technology.

‘I really felt there was a need for a device that looked and felt like a stylish watch first.

I wanted to create a wearable device that looked like a cool watch, first and foremost.’
