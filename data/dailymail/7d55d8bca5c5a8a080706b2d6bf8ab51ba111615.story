'Expect the unexpected': that is the advice security experts have handed out to the Brazilian authorities ahead of the 2014 World Cup.

The tournament begins on June 12 and the South American nation is bracing itself to deal with the threat of terrorism, hooliganism, violent protests and muggings.

An estimated 600,000 foreign nationals are expected to arrive between June and July for the month-long football extravaganza, and that has provided a raft of extra concerns to security forces.

Threat: There are serious terrorist fears in World Cup stadia, like the Arena Amazonia in Manaus (pictured)

Terrorism: Palestinian insurgents (left) tarnished the 1972 Munich Olympics, leading to armed guards (right)

Disaster: Security forces fear a repeat of the bombings that struck the 1996 Atlanta Olympics in Brazil

The first and perhaps most important issue is that of the threat of terrorism.

World Cups in the past have escaped being the target of terrorist attacks but the Olympic Games - at Atlanta 1996 and Munich 1972 - have shown that major sporting tournaments are susceptible to this threat.

Foreign visitors will also need to be protected from the widely publicised epidemic of muggings that has been sweeping through Brazilian cities.

It will take just one high-profile serious crime for the whole tournament to be tarnished.

Theft: Favelas in Brazil, like this one in Sao Paulo, are notorious for muggings and visitors could be susceptible

Security services are already expecting a repeat of last year's public protests which targeted the Confederations Cup - but this time they will likely be on a much larger and more embarrassing scale.

Add to that the violent clashes that have occurred in recent months between police and gangs in the favelas, and Brazil's police and army will have to show total restraint.

The eyes of the world will be watching them for any evidence of over-reaction or brutality.

Danger: Stars like Brazilian Neymar (left) and Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo will need protecting from terrorism

Finally, the so-called 'English disease' of hooliganism is a very real threat - but it is unlikely to be an England-related problem this time.

Experts believe organised hooligan gangs from Argentina may travel to Brazil and clash with local fans, who have something of a reputation themselves.

There have even been warnings that Argentinian gangs may target English supporters due to ill feeling over the Falkland islands.

From England, a team of six uniformed officers will travel to Brazil to give advice and be present at matches.

Brazilian authorities will also make 2,377 England fans with football banning orders surrender their passports.

Protest: Violent clashes have taken place in Brasilia (above) and other Brazilian cities just before the World Cup

Discontent: FIFA's decision to host the tournament in a nation with huge poverty has caused resentment

Police presence: Armed security forces will be at the World Cup, like they have been in Brasilia during protests

Brazil announced in February it would boost the number of security officers from 100,000 to 170,000, across the 12 host cities, with the armed forces also on standby. Of these, 20,000 will be stewards trained to work inside the 12 stadiums.

The United States has been heavily involved in planning to deal with the terrorism threat, with input from the FBI and the CIA.

There will be counter-terrorism units stationed near each venue while two unmanned drones, bought from Israel, will patrol the skies.

Dr Peter Tarlow, a security expert specialising in the impact of crime and terrorism on the tourism industry, said on www.elsevier.com: 'Brazil has traditionally never been a place of terrorism.

'With the coming of the World Cup, however, international problems now land on Brazil's doorstep.

'This means that Brazil has not only to deal with a high crime rate but also the potential for an act of terrorism.'
