A family doctor blackmailed a patient into submitting to his sexual demands in return for flu medication, a tribunal heard yesterday.

Gordon Barclay, 68, waved a green prescription form in the mother-of-one’s face, it was alleged, saying ‘You need that don’t you – I need to examine you’ before ordering her to strip off.

On another occasion when she complained of suffering from a fever, he felt her breasts with his stethoscope, the hearing was told.

He even went to her home when she left after he demanded she took her clothes off, told her she needed to be ‘examined’ then had sex with her, it was alleged.

The woman, referred to only as Patient A, was said to have been repeatedly molested during intimate examinations between July 2003 and July 2006 at the surgery in Essex.

She broke down in tears as she gave evidence to the General Medical Council yesterday, saying she felt she had no choice but to comply.

‘He said “You need medication and I need to examine you”, so it’s some kind of blackmailing. That’s if I don’t let him examine me I wouldn’t have that prescription,’ she said.

Patient A said the first time he sexually assaulted her was when she had been suffering from flu, arriving at the surgery with her young son.

She said Barclay told the boy to go back to the waiting room, saying ‘patients’ privacy, I need to talk to your mum alone’. She went on: ‘He told me to take off my clothes – I was shivering, I was so cold, I told him I was very cold and he said “You’ll get your medication, don’t worry”.’

The woman said Barclay, of Romford, Essex, came to her flat on one occasion after she refused his advances at the surgery and said he needed to examine her.

'It’s some kind of blackmail'

She added: ‘I said there’s a settee in the living room and he said “No, no, no, you come here” and he held my hand and the next room is the bedroom and then we were in there.

‘He always says “Take off your clothes”, whatever examination it is.’

She then told how the GP had sex with her. She claimed every time she saw the doctor except once he ‘examined’ her in this way and that if she did not come to the surgery for a few days he would phone and ask why she had not come in.

The hearing was told Patient A had a history of depression and anxiety and had been investigated for short-term memory loss.

She had seen a neurologist and had a brain scan due to headaches.

Barclay prescribed her Prozac which helped relieve her pain but then told her it was for ‘mad people and the mentally challenged’, she said.

Insisting the sex had not been consensual, she insisted: ‘It’s against my will, he’s forcing me to do that.’

Barclay, who is also an NHS trust medical adviser, was not at the hearing. He denies misconduct charges and faces allegations relating to a second woman known as Patient B.

The fitness to practise hearing in Manchester continues.
