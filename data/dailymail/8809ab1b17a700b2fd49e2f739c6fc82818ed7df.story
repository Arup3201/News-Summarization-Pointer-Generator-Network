Thai authorities said Monday they had 
arrested the owner of a sex show visited by pop icon Rihanna - the 
latest crackdown inadvertently triggered by the singer's tweets.

Warunyu Jornmuang, owner of the Season bar on Soi Bangla, Phuket, has been charged in connection with 
the lewd performance, according to Phuket Gazette.

Kathu District Chief Veera Kerdsirimongkol told the gazette said Jornmulang 'was arrested for operating an entertainment venue without a permit and for providing a lewd show.'

'It was the result of 
the visit by Rihanna. The authorities will be more strict towards 
inappropriate shows or wildlife attractions,' the district chief added to AFP.

Thai tourist officials were left red-faced after Rihanna's tweets underscored the kingdom's seedier side of the sex entertainment industry. She left little to the imagination with her highly descriptive tweets detailing a live sex show.

The 25-year-old Umbrella singer visited the club in the town of Patong and revealed in one tweet that during a performance, live animals including a bird and two turtles were used.

Pop singer by day, unintentional animal activist by night: Thai police arrested two men for selling photo ops with protected-species the slow loris after Rihanna posted a picture of herself with one on Instagram

Last month Thai police raided a tourist trap in Bangla Road, Phuket after Rihanna also posted a picture of her snuggling up to a protected species - a slow loris

She was in Thailand enjoying a brief break from her Diamonds World Tour when she ran in to trouble two nights running.

On Sept 20 she posted a link on Twitter to an Instagram photo that showed 
her in sunglasses snuggling up to a furry primate called the slow loris,
and wrote: 'Look who was talkin dirty to me!'

The slow loris, a squirrel-like animal with big eyes, is native to Southeast Asia and is listed as a protected species. Use
of the slow loris and other protected species for tourist snaps - while
common in Thai tourist resorts - is officially illegal.

Thai police must have been keeping 
tabs on Rihanna, because after she posted the picture, police in Phuket raided Bangla Road the following 
day to hunt out touts peddling the lorises for pictures with tourists.

'I
had an order from the Phuket Governor to do a raid today after Rihanna 
posted a photo of her with the loris,' Awat Nithikil, leader of the 
patrol officers and senior forest academic at Khao Phra Taew Forest 
Preserve, told the Phuket News.

'It
is very difficult to do the raids because the touts have spies. If 
someone hears that the police are coming their way, there will be a 
person who calls the touts and tells them to move,' he said.

But this time police were successful and apprehended two touts who were selling pictures with lorises.

The next night she posted the Tweet saying she was 'traumatized' by the live sex show had witnessed involving animals.

She then travelled to Singapore for her next concert on her Diamond Tour. She is now in South Africa.Â

offering 'ping-pong shows' due to the risk of overpriced drinks and 
threats of violence against people who refuse to pay.

One of the herd: The slow loris wasn't the only wildlife Rihanna checked out in Thailand. She posted another picture of her interacting with a herd of elephants

Phuket district chief Kerdsirimongkon said authorities have tried for 
years to crack down on the problem of vendors exploiting wildlife, 
particularly in popular tourist areas where people pay to pose for 
pictures with elephants, orangutans and other animals.

'It's
like a cat-and-mouse game. But this time it's bigger because a 
celebrity like Rihanna posted the picture, and there were more than 
200,000 "likes" from around the world,' he said.

Rihanna
also posted pictures of herself playing with a herd of elephants in the
street after which she tweeted: 'They all hail Empress 
when She walk by.'

The two lorises will be taken to a national park in Phang Nga.
