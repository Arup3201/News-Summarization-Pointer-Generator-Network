This lizard was caught on camera apparently strumming a leaf to its heart's content. 

The forest dragon lizard was spotted in the unusual pose by professional photographer Aditya Permana in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.

The 33-year-old caught the comical snap earlier this week and watched the critter for more than an hour before it began practicing its chords.

And the tiny reptile seemed completely at ease as it performing to an audience and reclined on its back and clutched the leaf between its feet.

Aditya said: 'I did not directly photograph the lizard at first, until the lizards feel calm and

comfortable around me.

'I noticed it looked like it was playing a guitar - and it didn't move at all.'
