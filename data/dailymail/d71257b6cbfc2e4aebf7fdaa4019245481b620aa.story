Socialites Ben and Kate Goldsmith were divorced today in 65 seconds on the grounds of Kate's adultery.

The
 multi-millionaire couple split last year after Mrs Goldsmith was 
believed to have had a passionate affair with American rapper Jay 
Electronica - leading to Mr Goldsmith's arrest for assault following a 
confrontation with his ex-wife and a bitter war of words over Twitter.

However, the pair are now believed to be on far better terms.

And
 today, a judge at London['s High Court held that Mrs Goldsmith, 30, had
 'committed adultery...and that the petitioner finds it intolerable to 
live with the respondent.'

Gone in 65 seconds: Ben and Kate Goldsmith were divorced today at London's High Court on the grounds of her adultery.

Eight years: Ben and Kate Goldsmith were married for eight years and have three young children.

The affidavit in support of Mr 
Goldsmith's petition says he first became aware of his wife's adultery 
on May 31, 2012, and this is also admitted in Mrs Goldsmith's 
acknowledgement of service of the divorce petition.

The co-respondent was un-named in the documents.

The couple were just 23 and 21 when they married in Paris in September 2003 and have three young children.

After raging over Twitter, Mr Goldsmith - the
 son of the late billionaire James Goldsmith and socialite Annabel 
Goldsmith - admitted he was 'stupid' to have become embroiled in a nasty
 row after their breakup two years ago.

He
 is now dating film producer Jemima Jones, while the exact nature of 
Kate's relationship with rapper Jay is now unclear.

Young love: Ben and Kate Goldsmith at their second wedding ceremony at St Mary's Church, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, in September 2003.

New Orleans-born rapper Jay, 36, whose real name is Timothy Elpadaro
 Thedford, is the father of singer Erykah Badu's daughter, Mars Merkaba Thedford. The couple were together for nine years.

Financier Mr Goldsmith, 32, has just returned after whisking off his girlfriend of six months, Jemima, 25, to Morocco.

And
 earlier this month, he told the Mail's Richard Kay: ‘Things are good. 
We’ve just returned from a romantic trip and it was wonderful.'

The
 pair made their first public appearance last September at fundraiser 
for anti-factory farming campaign Pig Business at London restaurant Sake
 No Hana.

‘I am going to 
introduce her to Kate in the next two weeks,’ financier and 
environmentalist Ben told his sister-in-law Alice at the event, 
organised by the Marchioness of Worcester. ‘Kate doesn’t love me any 
more – she doesn’t care.’

His elder brother, MP Zac, 38, made Kate’s younger sister Alice, 26, his second wife, in March.

Mr Goldsmith admitted that he was foolhardy to have lashed out at his ex-wife on Twitter, telling The Telegraph: 'I was stupid to have said anything on Twitter. It's no excuse, but I was devastated,' he told The Telegraph.

Police arrested Mr Goldsmith at the couple’s 
£20million Kensington home in April 2011 on suspicion of actual bodily harm.

It followed a confrontation between 
the Eton-educated financier, who 
inherited £300million after the death of his father, and his wife over 
explicit texts and emails between her and Jay Electronica.

Mr Goldsmith later accepted a caution for assault before announcing he was filing for divorce on grounds of adultery.

A
 friend of Mr Goldmsith told The Sunday Times: 'He was in a terrible 
state. Unless you've been through an acrimonious divorce you can't 
imagine what they were going through. Ben was desperately in love with 
her and I think marrying so young was a way of escaping the Goldsmith 
playboy image and establishing a stable foundation for his life. Then it
 all went wrong.'

During the Twitter row, Mr Goldsmith responded to an interview his estranged
 wife had given, blaming their split on the young age at which they 
married, said:
 ‘Someone PLEASE shut this girl up. It’s embarrassing.’

His tweet then 
provoked a response from the man Mrs Goldsmith left her husband for.

Responding
 to Mr Goldsmith, Jay Electronica tweeted: ‘I’m getting sick and tired 
of your bull***t, Ben,’ and he added: ‘Get a grip.’

After
 the series of bitter messages, the couple released a joint statement 
through a PR company. It said: ‘We are both deeply saddened that our 
marriage has ended after nine years.

‘It
 is a matter of regret to us that, at a time when our emotions and those
 of our friends have run high, things have been said in public which 
should have been kept private. We accept our full share of 
responsibility for this.

‘There will be no further comment, either directly or indirectly, from us on any aspect of our family’s private life.’

Record
 company boss Mrs Goldsmith is still living in her marital home with her
 children – just a stone’s-throw away from Jay Electronica, who moved 
from Belgravia to be near her.

However,
 last September, the Mail on Sunday reported that she was was 
'unimpressed' by his budding friendship with stunning Burberry model 
Cara Delevingne.

A source said: ‘Kate and Jay are having fearful rows as he’s getting too close to Cara for her liking.’
