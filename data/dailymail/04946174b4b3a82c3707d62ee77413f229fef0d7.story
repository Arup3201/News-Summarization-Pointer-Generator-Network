When Liz Crowter put pictures of her vivacious daughter on a Down’s syndrome support group’s website, she had hoped to show others how those with the condition were ‘just like you and me’.

But her efforts have backfired after internet ‘trolls’ stole the family snaps of Heidi, now 16, from the site – and published them on mocking Facebook pages.

One of the pages was illustrated with pictures of Heidi as a toddler and joked about losing ‘your virginity to a retard’.

Another was called: ‘Your milkshake [body] brings all the tards to the yard’ – a twisted reference to a popular song.

Mrs Crowter, who has three other children, said: ‘It makes me sad and angry that people don’t see it as wrong to be so hurtful.

‘They simply cannot have had the pleasure of meeting anyone with Down’s, otherwise they would realise they are warm human beings like anyone else.’

She added: ‘There have been other cases of trolls ending up in court and I’d like to see these trolls face the same punishment if possible.’

The images had been stolen from the 
Coventry and Rugby Down’s Syndrome Support group website, which Mrs 
Crowter ran for five years until 2009.

She and her husband Steve, 43, discovered the first mocking page online last September and it has since been taken down.

But earlier this month, the couple, 
who run a car dealership, became aware of the ‘milkshake’ page and a 
third, also on Facebook.

‘I feel violated and violated on Heidi’s behalf…It’s not just Heidi, it’s photos of other people’s children as well,’ Mrs Crowter added.

Despite repeatedly reporting the trolls, the couple say Facebook has made no direct contact with them.

Although Heidi’s picture has now been removed from the second page, the third remains online and contains at least 13 images of her.

Mrs Crowter, from Coventry, said she had contacted West Midlands Police, but said she was told that it was not a matter for officers.

Down’s syndrome is a genetic condition caused by an extra chromosome in a baby’s cells. In the UK, around one baby in every 1,000 is born with it.

Mrs Crowter said Heidi was a ‘very independent young lady’, who was studying for her GCSEs at a mainstream school and doing a hairdressing course. Facebook said that once images were reported, they were reviewed by its User Operations Team.

A spokesman said: ‘When people on Facebook do find themselves in a situation where they feel uncomfortable, we encourage them to use our reporting tools.’

West Midlands Police confirmed it had received a complaint but said this was withdrawn after the photograph was removed from Facebook.

Officers had visited the complainant to reassure her and ‘ensure no offences had been committed’, a spokesman said.
