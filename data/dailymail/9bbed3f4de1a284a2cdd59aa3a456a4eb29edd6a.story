As many as 2,000 rural post offices are to close in favour of downgraded services which will open up in other commercial premises, it has emerged.

Around one fifth of the network's 11,500 branches will be changed into new 'PO Locals' offering limited counter services in garages and shops.

Under the plans, which start next June, it will no longer be possible to apply for driving licences, send bulky post overseas, pay car tax or make cash withdrawals using pass books.

Concerns: Around 2,000 rural post offices will close next summer under plans to replace them with 'PO Locals' offering a limited service in garages and shops

Post Office Limited has been gradually rolling out a trial of the new service, which has resulted in the number of PO Locals doubling from 60 earlier this year to 115, according to the Daily Telegraph.

Consumer Focus, the postal services watchdog, has expressed serious concerns over the move.

Andy Burrowes, a postal expert at Consumer Focus, said the trials found that often postal services were treated as a 'secondary offer' by the shop or garage owner in PO Locals.

He added: 'These are subtle but quite fundamental changes for customers concerned.'

It is claimed that longstanding post office customers would have to queue up behind people buying milk and crisps in order to receive their weekly pensions.

Some PO Locals even ran out of money and were not able to pay benefits because they cannot hold as much cash as Post Office branches, it was reported in the Telegraph.

Sub-postmasters are apparently being offered the equivalent of 18 monthsâ€™ salary if they agree to close down or convert into a PO Local.

Michelle Mitchell, Charity Director of Age UK, said: 'It is imperative that there is as little disruption as possible to the service for older customers during this programme of conversion.'

Last night, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which is expected to take over the running of the post office network from Royal Mail in April next year, defended the plans.

A spokesman said: 'The Post Office network will be maintained at its current size and coverage of 11,500 outlets nationwide and strict access criteria must be met to ensure reasonable access to services for all.'
