Sun-seeking tourists on the Greek island of Samos are getting more than they bargained for on the beach.

Alongside middle-aged men in unsightly Speedos and the obligatory lobster-coloured Britons, visitors to the island have been shocked to see a seal languishing on sun loungers or frolicking in the waves.

While monk seals normally choose quiet caves and peaceful coves as resting sites, this seal - named ‘Argiro’ by local fishermen - prefers the company of humans and has chosen a spot on some of the most bustling beaches on the island, even upgrading herself to a sunbed, on occasion.

Beach goers are surprised to learn they will be sharing the sand with a monk seal called Argiro 

First spotted in March, and one of only 450 remaining monk seals worldwide, at first the team from the Archipelagos Institute attempted to deter attention and minimize human disturbance for Argiro.

However Argiro’s sociable nature made this impossible, and the Archipelagos Institute team and its volunteers is therefore using Argiro’s presence to raise awareness of the endangered species and the conservation work they are undertaking to protect it.

The team hope Argiro will return to her natural habitat of her own accord, but in the meantime, they are on hand to advise visitors to the beach on how to behave around Argiro as a means of protecting her.

Any efforts to minimise Argiro's contact with humans has been scarped by her sociable nature

Efforts to minimise human contact have involved close collaboration with an extensive network of volunteers from the local community including fishermen, farmers, tourism professionals, students and teachers, as well as valuable assistance from the local port authorities. 

‘The Archipelagos Institute will do everything it can to ensure the protection of Argiro. This seal has served as an excellent ambassador for her species and reminds us that, as in ancient Greece, all wildlife – particularly seals and dolphins – can coexist in harmony with humans,’ says Archipelagos Institute director, Thodoris Tsimpidis.
