A father who has the same birthday as his son was left stunned when his second child was born on exactly the same day again - at odds of 133,224 to one.

Anthony Reading, 26, now has no excuse for forgetting either Tyler or Joey's birthdays because they were all born on June 8.

Anthony, from Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, was amazed when he welcomed his first son Tyler into the world exactly 24 years to the day since his own birth.

Originally due at the end of May, the youngster actually arrived two weeks late but perfectly in time to share his father's special day.

Having had a double celebration for the past two years, the 26-year-old then went on to defy astounding odds and make the day a triple celebration after his second son Joey was born, like his father and brother, on June 8.

Dr Adam Johansen, at University of Warwick, said the odds of two children being born with the same birthday as their father were 133,224-1.

'If you assume these things are completely independent, then the probability that the father's first son is born on the same day as him is one in 365,' he said.

'The probability of his second son being born on the same day is again one in 365. You then have to multiply the two figures together to give you odds of 133,224 to one that all three are born on the same day.'

Anthony said: 'Having a child is a wonderful thing and I felt really blessed when Tyler was born healthy and happy back in 2011.

'The icing on the cake was the fact he came along on my birthday as it meant we would always be able to celebrate the day together.

'Unfortunately things didn't work out with Tyler's mum but we have stayed in contact and are still really good friends, which means I see him regularly.'

He has since found happiness with current partner Katy Porter and the pair could barely believe it when baby Joey showed up on both Anthony and Tyler's birthday less than two weeks ago.

Talking about receiving his second unexpected birthday present, Anthony, who works night shifts at Asda, added: 'Joey was actually due on July 6 so myself and Katy never really thought there would be a chance of us all being born on the same day.

'It seems Joey had other ideas though and he ended up coming four weeks prematurely on both Tyler and my birthday.

'We were both completely stunned and pretty much everyone who I have told since thinks I'm joking or trying to wind them up because it's so unbelievable.

'After he was born, Joey suffered from jaundice and had to undergo a lot of tests before he was allowed to leave the hospital but now he is back at home and we're enjoying every minute.

'I couldn't ask for anything more than to share my birthday with my two favourite boys. A day that was already special has become even more so now. It's the best present in the world and more than I could ever ask for.'
