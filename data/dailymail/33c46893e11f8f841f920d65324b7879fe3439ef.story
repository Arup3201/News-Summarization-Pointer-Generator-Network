The brown and black plaid jacket is expected to take a staggering $73,000 at auction 

A jacket worn by Leonardo DiCaprio in the famous 'king of the world' scene in blockbuster Titanic has emerged for sale with a staggering $70,000 price tag.

DiCaprio, who played struggling artist Jack Dawson in the 1997 hit film, was wearing the brown and black plaid jacket in the unforgettable scene where he is stood at the bow of the legendary ocean liner.

As the doomed ship heads out into the Atlantic Ocean on its ill-fated voyage, DiCaprio's character jumps up onto the railings and with open arms declares: 'I'm the king of the world!'

The scene is among the most memorable of the film and the 'king of the world' line has been voted among the top 100 film quotes of all time.

DiCaprio recreates the pose later in the film when he woos Kate Winslet's well-to-do socialite character Rose DeWitt Bukater.

Rather than being made specially for the film, costume designer Deborah Lynne Scott hand-picked the vintage jacket from costume rental company Repeat Performance.

After filming was over the jacket was returned to the company, which has now decided to sell it 17 years after the film's release.

Experts have described the coat as the 'Holy Grail of film collecting'. 

They expect it to fetch $70,000 when it goes under the hammer at Californian auction house Profiles in History in October.

Brian Chanes, an expert from Profiles in History, said: 'Leonardo's character Jack is wearing this jacket when he first meets Rose but the scene in which it is most prominent in is the famous 'king of the world' scene.

'It's a signature part of the film before the boat starts sinking in a bit that leads up to Jack and Rose falling in love.

'The scene was so iconic it was used in promotional materials. It's an incredibly memorable line and it's been voted in the top 100 movie quotes of all time.

'This coat is the only one in the world - the costume designer for Titanic hand-picked it from a vintage rental shop because she thought it personified Leonardo's character Jack.

'It has been consigned by the rental house and we have all the documentation to back it up.

'When it comes to collecting the wardrobes of modern actors, Leonardo DiCaprio is in a league of his own - collectors clamor for material from Leo.

'Titanic is a modern classic and this is one of the top pieces you could ever hope to obtain. This coat is like the Holy Grail of modern film collecting.' 

The auction will take place on October 17.
