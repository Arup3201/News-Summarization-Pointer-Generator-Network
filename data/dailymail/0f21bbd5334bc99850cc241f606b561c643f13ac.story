British holidaymakers may regard their mobile as an essential part of their holiday - but how others use theirs while abroad is just as important.

Research has found 69 per cent of Brits couldn't live without their phone on holiday, but interestingly, we are the nation that gets most perturbed about fellow tourists' 'mobile etiquette'.

Making calls on speakerphone is the main bug-bear according to 55 per cent of British holidaymakers, above the worldwide average.  

Staying connected: Nearly 70% of Brits admitted they could not go on holiday without their mobile phone

Playing games and videos without headphones, taking photos of strangers and making calls in a restaurant also infuriates us more than people from other countries.

British travellers should be forewarned, however, that more than 25 per cent of French and Spanish tourists admit to making speakerphone calls and photographing strangers while on holiday.

Globally, it seems that Brazilians and Thais are the worst offenders when it comes to mobile etiquette, with 43 per cent of Thais admitting to filming or photographing people they don't know.

More than a fifth of Brazilians said they make calls with on speakerphone in public when travelling.

But although electronic devices are an important addition to our holidays, the loss off these wouldn't affect us quite so much as others. 

Travellers from the US, Norway, Sweden, India, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand say losing their mobile device when travelling internationally would cause more anxiety than losing their luggage.

However the expense of replacing the device would play on the minds of Brits, with 42 per cent saying they would be affected by this, compared to a world average of 37 per cent.

A report released on Thursday has highlighted the growing importance British travellers place on their mobile devices, coupled with a strong anxiety of losing them while away.

The research, by travel website Expedia, shows that 89 per cent of Brits take one or more mobile devices on holiday, with 69 per cent using their phone for the duration of their trip away.

Contrary to the perception of mobile devices chaining Brits to their workplace even when on holiday, 90 per cent of the UK feel new technology and apps enhance their travel experience; from the initial holiday research, right through to boarding a flight back home we see our mobiles as a 'travel concierge'.

More than 35 per cent of Brits polled research their holiday destinations on their devices, with the most popular place for Brits to plan travel being in bed (42 per cent) but for 12 per cent of us the bathroom’s our holiday planning spot.

Once abroad, mobiles are increasingly used to manage holiday time, one in four (26 per cent) feel mobile helps them to be more flexible with their travel plans, with 37 per cent using mobile to get tips on the way. 

More than 27 per cent of Brits have used smartphones to manage their itinerary for business with 38 per cent regarding automatic itinerary updates as an essential function for a travel app. Even for leisure travel we increasingly turn to our smartphones for itinerary management with over 17 per cent doing so.

33% of holidaymakers said they use their mobile data to upload photos to social media while on holiday

Mobiles are the personal assistant we look to for receiving flight alerts for 21 per cent of us, checking in for a flight for 19 per cent.

One in ten of us have booked their ground transportation or checked into hotel room via a mobile device. Similarly, almost half of the UK is using maps and navigation functions to find their way around during their holiday.

Even abroad, though, it seems the British obsession with the weather is still prevalent, with the data showing checking the weather is more important than using social media, for both UK leisure and business travellers. 

Thirty-nine per cent regularly make sure the sun will be shining versus only 33 per cent updating their social profiles, while away.

'We are entering a new era where people are move fluidly across desktop, phone, tablet, even wearables as they plan, book and then ultimately take their trip,' said Andy Washington, managing director of Expedia.co.uk 

'Travellers are not only researching and booking trips on mobile, but they’re also complimenting their meals, and capturing every trip detail. 

'This is the new normal when it comes to travel. We need to be able to develop relevant products to meet these needs and to offer a consistently high level of service as customers move from one device to another.'

Graham Kingsmill, managing director of Egencia UK, said: 'More people each day use their smartphones and tablets to help navigate their business trips.

Making calls on speakerphone is the biggest bugbear for 55% of Brits abroad

'We believe that mobile devices can do more for business travellers and we wanted to understand how. Checking in for a flight or refuelling the rental car before returning it can all be made easier with the right app. 

'We have seen that many business travellers will use apps to book hotels at the last minute if these apps feature a great modern experience, and this makes their business travel more productive and cost-efficient.'

Despite our reliance on mobile devices abroad, it seems that UK residents are not as savvy as our global counterparts when it comes to data roaming charges. 

Even though the European Union has capped roaming charges, less than half of UK travellers were aware of this new legislation (44 per cent), compared to 63 per cent of Germans knowing about it. 

So it seems this will come as welcome news for the 61 per cent of Brits who don’t purchase an international data/roaming plan before going away, allowing them to continue staying connected at all times. 

Forty-two per cent of Brits admit to spending more than twenty pounds on roaming during a one-week holiday within Europe. On average we spend 33 per cent more than we consider reasonable.

It appears that as our business and leisure time converge, the importance of having a connected mobile device when travelling is increasing. 

Complimentary WiFi and high speed internet are the two most important factors when booking a hotel for both global and UK holiday and business travellers. 

British business travellers are highly likely to take a smartphone on their travels (82 per cent), compared to only a relatively modest proportion (59 per cent) who take a laptop on business trips, lower than the average across all the markets surveyed.
