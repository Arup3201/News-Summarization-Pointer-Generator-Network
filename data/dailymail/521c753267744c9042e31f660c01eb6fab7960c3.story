No wonder bed bugs are rife. A new survey has revealed that the average single man changes his bed sheets just four times per year.

And it's the younger single lads who are best avoided, with the grubbiest age group being revealed as those aged 18-25.

That's gross! A new survey has revealed that the average single adult male washes his bed sheets just four times per year; averaging a change once every three months

Coupled-up Britons change their sheets 
most frequently according to the results, averaging a sheet swap every two weeks, while single women change theirs every 2.5 weeks.

Unsurprisingly, it's women who take charge of the laundry in 81 per cent of relationships.

The study also narrowed down results to look at cleanliness by age group.

Of those who claimed to wash their sheets once every three months or less, 55 per cent were aged 18-25, with men accounting for 71 per cent of the respondents.

In contrast, those who claimed to wash their sheets once a week on average were predominantly aged between 35-50; 62 per cent were female.

Some 17 per cent of the single men taking part claimed that a prospective partner has been 'put off' by the cleanliness of their bed sheets

Those who claimed to change their bed linen once every three months or less were asked why this was the case.

The majority (49 per cent) simply claimed that they felt this was an ‘acceptable gap’ to leave between sheet changes, while 22 per cent ‘didn’t see the need’ to change them more frequently.

Just under a fifth simply ‘didn’t care.’

Women are chief bed sheet changers in 81 per cent of relationships, and the single ladies change theirs every 2.5 weeks on average

However, 17 per cent of the single men taking part claimed that a prospective partner has been ‘put off’ by the cleanliness of their bed sheets in the past, compared to just 2 per cent of the single women taking part.

When asked whether or not they always changed guest bed sheets after having guests to stay, just 32 per cent said ‘yes’.

Of those who didn’t, two thirds claimed that they left the same sheets on until they’d had ‘several guests’ to stay in them.

Single male respondents were asked how many different bed sheet sets they owned, to which the average answer was ‘one set’ for just over half of those taking part.

In contrast, single female respondents claimed to own an average of three sets, according to the majority.

Jed MacEwan, Ergoflex UK spokesperson, who carried out the survey, said: 'We were quite alarmed at the apparent lack of basic hygiene from some respondents.

'Unclean bed sheets contain the tens of thousands of dead skin cells that we shed every night, and by going months without cleaning them you’re risking some distinctly unpleasant consequences every time you go to bed.

'Dust mites would find a perfect habitat in such unhygienic bed sheets, and it's well documented that they can cause allergic flare-ups, asthma, rhinitis and other physical reactions.

'Also, by allowing your bed to become so unclean you’re almost asking for a bed bug infestation, which could prove to be a high price to pay for simply not washing your sheets more regularly.'
