Being suddenly plunged into darkness during power cuts can be a frightening and inconvenient experience.

But one inventor has created what he claims is the world’s first light bulb that won’t turn off in a power outage.

Shailendra Suman’s device looks similar to a normal light bulb and can be screwed into every day light sockets, but it is far handier in a crisis.

The device (pictured) was invented by Mr Suman, 52, from North Carolina after he became frustrated that he couldn't find a torch during a power cut at his home

Wattage: 5 Watt LED

Battery life: 4 hours of continuous use during a power outage

Voltage: 110 V - 240 V

Base type: E26, E27, B22

Battery type: Rechargeable lithium ion battery

Battery charge time:  6 hours

Bulb life: 25,000 hrs

Cost: $35 or $40 for international orders

When the power supply is running to a property the LED bulb uses the same power source as all other light bulbs.

But when the power supply fails, it switches to an using a rechargeable battery so that power outages are not as disruptive.

The device was invented by Mr Suman, 52, from North Carolina after he became frustrated that he couldn't find a torch during a power cut at his home.

The bulb works like a normal bulb and uses an everyday light switch but when the power goes out, it continues to light up. It is filled with technology (pictured) so that it can continue to work without mains power

When the power supply fails, Shailendra Suman's SmartCharge bulb  switches to an LED bulb with a rechargeable battery so that power outages are not as obvious. He is pictured here with his battery-operated bulb

To solve the problem, he researched and designed his SmartCharge bulb, which can be pre-ordered for $35 each (£21) or $40, (£24) with international shipping and are estimated to be delivered in April.

‘About three years ago, we could not find the torch during a power cut. I then thought that having a light bulb which works during a power cut would be convenient and cool,’ Mr Suman said.

‘I researched the net and there was nothing available in market except some standalone emergency lights or backup generators for commercial applications.

‘This is the first of its kind. This bulb works like a normal bulb and uses the normal light switch but when the power goes out, it continues to light up.’

He explained that the bulb can be turned on and off from the same wall switch during a power failure.

The bulb has an intelligent control circuit with grid and switch sensor technology, a rechargeable battery with charging circuit and an inverter, he said.

The bulb has a battery, control technology, intelligence, CPU, memory, inverter, and a printed circuit board inside (pictured) to make it smart and efficient, SmartCharge said

‘The bulb also houses a CPU, memory and a printed circuit board to make it smart and efficient,’ he added.

‘After a power failure, bulb will stay on for four hours continuous use and it can be used almost anywhere.

‘On top of that there is no change in wiring required or any extra hardware needed -all people need to do is simply change their existing bulb.’

Mr Suman is currently raising funds to manufacture his SmartCharge bulb on crowd funding website Kickstarter and has pulled in $91,804 – more than the $50,000 he set out to raise.

After a power failure, the bulb will stay on for four hours and it can be used almost anywhere. Here, its inventor demonstrates how it can be carried like a torch as well as operated via a normal lighting socket
