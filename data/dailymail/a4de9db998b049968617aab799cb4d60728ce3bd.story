Excited fans flocked to YouTube on Christmas Eve to rent  The Interview after Sony posted the film online to thwart hackers' attempts to prevent its release.

The controversial comedy, which depicts an assassination attempt on the North Korean leader, was available to rent or purchase on several websites in the U.S, with viewers forking out a minimum of $6 to watch it from start to finish. 

Within hours it had been viewed more than 10,000 times, with viewers sharing their reviews on social media afterwards. 

Overnight other fans visited cinemas to view the film in person, with some donning Christmas outfits for the occasion.

Within hours of being uploaded online more than 10,000 fans shared their praise of the film on social media

It comes as cinema chains across the country pulled out of plans to show the film amid 'security concerns' after hackers published scores of confidential information from Sony's database. 

American authorities accused North Korea of the breach which leaked private emails and exchanges, and urged Sony to release the film as planned despite threats. 

President Obama later praised the company's decision not to halt the film's release. 

'As the president made clear, we are a country that believes in free speech, and the right of artistic expression,' a statement given by his spokesman said.  

'The decision made by Sony and participating theatres allows people to make their own choices about the film, and we welcome that outcome.'

Yesterday the film's stars James Franco and Seth Rogan took to social media to announce it would be made available online.  

Within hours of it being uploaded, the film had been viewed more than 10,000 times. The majority of viewers gave it a 'thumbs up' on Youtube, with around 800 giving it a poor review.

Among the first verdicts was praise for its comedic value and warnings about expletive language.

'Hey North Korea... I just watched the Interview and I laughed by butt off!!! Thanks YouTube!!' said one happy customer, while another said paying $5.99 to watch the film was 'totally worth it.' 

Last week Sony fell victim to one of the most destructive cyber-attacks in recent memory. 

Among information released was a chain of emails between co-chair Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin who made racially insensitive remarks about President Obama's film tastes. 

A further series of  internal documents were also made public, ranging from plans for the upcoming James Bond film, to internal emails arguing over the company's direction, to discussion of past theatrical failures.

Pascal has been especially embarrassed by the leaks, recently having emails released revealing that things are so bad between the actor and the studio in fact that Sony head Amy Pascal calls him an 'a**hole* not once, but twice in emails exchanges.

She also believed Idris Elba should be cast as the next James Bond.

Meanwhile Angelina Jolie was referred to as a 'a minimally talented spoiled brat' in one exchange discussing the star's passion project remake of Cleopatra. 

While a select view were able to watch the film without a glitch, others endured server crashes and disrupted connections due in part to a surge in traffic.

'Well after 3 server crashes on You Tube... finished The Interview... it wasn't bad. It is at times filled with adult situations, language R (rated)!' said another viewer.  

The film cannot be viewed online in Europe or Asia. 

Scores of cinemas in America will still show the film, with many Christmas Day showings already sold-out. 

Organisers said they would take extra safety measures in light of the film's controversy. 

'When a film attracts this kind of hype, there has to be concerns," said Greg Laemmle, co-owner and president of Laemmle, an art house chain with several theaters in Los Angeles. 

'As long as we're not being irresponsible in terms of addressing patron safety, we really need to support freedom of artistic expression.' 

While North Korea has denied it is responsible for the cyberattack on Sony, it supported calls for the film to be banned. 

Yesterday a photograph of the country's leader Kim Jong-Un wearing makeup swept social media, with those sharing the image proclaiming: 'You can't silence our freedom of speech'.
