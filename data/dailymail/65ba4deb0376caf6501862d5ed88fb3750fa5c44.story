A fugitive sex offender who police want to question over the disappearance of a young nursing student Holly Bobo has been arrested.

Victor George Wall, 43, who was convicted of molesting a child in Washington state more than 20 years ago, was found at his girlfriend's home in Duluth, Minnesota.

Miss Bobo, 20, from Parsons, Tennessee, went missing four months ago after she was abducted from her home by a man wearing camouflage clothing.

Wall was asleep at the time, arrested without incident and booked into the St. Louis County Jail. He will be extradited to Tennessee.

He used to live near Bobo's Tennessee home.

Bobo, a cousin of country music star Whitney
Duncan was last seen being dragged across the carport from her family 
home towards a wooded area.

Her heartbroken parents Dana and Karen Bobo have continued the search for their daughter but the case has remained unsolved.

Her brother Clint Bobo, 25, told 
police that he saw his sister outside the house with a man before she 
was kidnapped at around 7.30am on April 13.

Mr Bobo only saw the man from the back and
told police he believed at the time it was the University of Tennessee 
student’s boyfriend.

But shocked Mr Bobo later called 911 after he witnessed an attack and saw blood outside the home. Miss Bobo’s lunchbox was later found several miles away.

Police had said they believe the man 
who kidnapped Miss Bobo could live in or near the college student’s home-town 
of Parsons.

Officials have not yet reported any previous connection between Wall and Miss Bobo, reported Fox News.

Miss Bobo was abducted as she was leaving
for university.She is 5ft 3in tall with shoulder-length blonde hair and
weighs around 110lbs.

Devastated: Her parents Dan and Karen Bobo made an appeal for anyone with details to come forward

She was wearing a pink shirt and light blue jeans at the time of her suspected abduction.

Devastated family and friends have been working with police to try and find her.

'Please pray for her': Country singer Whitney Duncan, Holly's cousin, appealed on Facebook

Police conducted a grid 
search of the area on horseback and used sniffer dogs and a helicopter 
in a bid to find her.

The missing student's parents Dan and Karen have made repeated pleas for help in finding their daughter.

Barely able to contain his tears, Dan Bobo said earlier this year: 'We've got thousands of people, we've got friends and neighbours and people we don't even know helping us.

When asked what he would say to his missing daughter he replied: 'I would tell her I love her, and tell her to call us.

'We are hopeful she is going to be brought back soon.'

Speculating on who may have abducted his daughter, Mr Bobo added: 'The way it looks to me myself, it might have been somebody close.

'Somebody that kinda knew our routine, knew when she (Karen) left, when I left, when my daughter left to go to school, is what I kinda got in my mind, but I don't know that for sure.'

Barely able to talk, Karen Bobo said: 'Holly I love you so much, please try and get back to us.'

Miss Bobo's cousin, the country singer Whitney Duncan, also made an appeal at the time for help to her fans to pray for Holly's safe return.

My cousin Holly was kidnapped this 
morning,' she wrote on Facebook. 'Please pray for her & our family. 
This is really sad & shocking.'

She tweeted: 'Lord have mercy. I feel
like I'm walking in a nightmare. Thanks for all the prayers and please 
keep spreading the amber alert.'

Bud Grimes, a spokesman for the University of Tennessee at Martin, said Miss Bobo was studying to be a licensed practical nurse through the Tennessee Technology Center.

She was taking classes at the university's extension campus in Parsons, but was not a UT-Martin student.

Family friend David Ivey, whose son went to high school with Miss Bobo, said the young woman has an 'angelic voice' and loved to show it off in talent contests at school.

She also would sing solos at Corinth Baptist Church where she was a member, he said.

Her pastor, Don Franks, from the Corinth Baptist Church, said he has known the young woman all her life and called her 'a fine young Christian girl' with the voice of an angel.
