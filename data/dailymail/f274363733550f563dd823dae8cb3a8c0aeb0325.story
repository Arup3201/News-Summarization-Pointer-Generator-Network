Brazil responded to World Cup humiliation, shipping 10 goals in their final two games, to bringing back one of their grittiest former captains.

Dunga was handed the responsibility of rebuilding a fallen team from the ashes of a 7-1 semi-final defeat by Germany and 3-0 loss at the hands of Holland.

His appointment was a controversial one among Brazil supporters, having guided his country in a lacklustre 2010 World Cup before he was sacked the last time.

But when a nation was so embarrassed in their own backyard, a strong head was needed to take control and the 1994 World Cup winner was deemed the man for the job.

‘We want to build a modern, compact, aggressive team but without losing the essence of Brazilian football - the dribble and the creativity,’ Dunga said in Paris ahead of playing France.

Six wins from six matches, clean sheets in the first five of those and only one goal conceded plus fourteen scored is the perfect response to former manager Luiz Felipe Scolari’s failings last summer.

Dunga has encouraged his full backs to sit deeper, opting for Porto’s Danilo and Chelsea’s Filipe Luis on the flanks despite the more attack-minded Marcelo performing well for Real Madrid.

Barcelona’s right back Dani Alves has also been a major casualty of the World Cup and Dunga has waved goodbye to Jo and Fred up front, who sound more like characters from a Last of the Summer Wine episode and played like them, too.

The goalkeeper, Julio Cesar, had to go and Botafogo stopper Jefferson is performing strongly, but being challenged by Valencia’s Diego Alves for the No 1 spot.

Thiago Silva is struggling to get back into the side at centre-back alongside Paris Saint-Germain team-mate David Luiz, even though his performances in the World Cup were praised and he missed the mauling by Germany due to injury.

In Silva’s absence after he missed the first match, a 1-0 win against Colombia, due to injury, Atletico Madrid’s Miranda has forged a strong partnership with Luiz.

The captaincy has also been taken off him and handed to Neymar, who has responded with six goals in as many games.

They have more exciting options up front; Shakhtar Donetsk striker Luiz Adriano is currently this season’s Champions League top-scorer and he is vying for a place as their No 9 with Diego Tardelli, who netted a double in a 2-0 win against Argentina.

Neymar has scored six goals in six games since the World Cup and has been in fine form

There are still two places available in Brazil’s attacking midfield three alongside Neymar, and Chelsea’s Oscar and Willian are front-runners. Their pressing attacking play, instilled by Jose Mourinho, is a facet to forward players which particularly impresses Dunga.

But another name emerging is 23-year-old Hoffenheim forward Roberto Firmino, who scored a 25-yard bullet to win their last match against Austria after being included in the squad for the first time. He is expected to start against France.

Philippe Coutinho, brutally left out of the World Cup squad by Scolari, is another banging on the door, especially with his performances for Liverpool.

Maintaining a core from the World Cup, Fernandinho, Ramires, Luiz Gustavo, have all been given chances in the middle.

Dunga has also been experimenting with some nostalgic choices. He has just recalled 31-year-old Robinho to the squad, even though he has had a mediocre spell back in Brazil with Santos on loan from AC Milan. He is a favourite of Dunga, but not of the fans.

Back in October, Kaka, another surprise omission from the World Cup, also got a late call-up as a replacement for the friendlies against Argentina and Japan. He came on for the last eight minutes against Argentina and 14 against Japan (a game they won 4-0) but has not made it into the latest squad.
