Nicolas Sarkozy has infuriated ethnic minorities by claiming that there are ‘too many immigrants in France’ and that the number arriving should be reduced by almost half.

The outspoken claims were made on live TV as the increasingly desperate President tried to persuade people to re-elect him in May.

‘Our system of integration is getting worse and worse,’ said Mr Sarkozy.

Outspoken: French President Nicolas Sarkozy claimed on live TV that too many immigrants were living in the country

‘We have too many foreigners on our territory and we can no longer manage to find them accommodation, a job, a school.’

The conservative President, who is trailing badly in all opinion polls to his Socialist rival Francois Hollande, said he wanted to reduce the number of immigrants from some 180,000 a year to 100,000.

His controversial comments came as his wife Carla Bruni caused fury across France by referring to the couple as 'modest people'.

The 44-year-old heiress, who is regularly compared to the French queen Marie Antoinette because of her pampered lifestyle, made the claim as she watched her husband take part in a live TV debate.

Speaking about immigration, Mr Sarkozy said: ‘Over the five year term, I think that to restart the process of integration in the right way, we must divide by two the number of people that we welcome, that is to say to pass from 180,000 per year to 100,000.’

Mr Sarkozy said he also wanted to limit the amount of welfare benefits paid to immigrant workers so that only those had lived in the country for 10 years, and worked for at least five, received them.

In what appeared to be a specific attack on Jews and Muslims – who make up a community of around 5 million in France and are the largest ethnic minority – Mr Sarkozy had earlier called for all kosher and halal products to be labelled properly.

He said that all consumers needed to know whether food had been prepared in accordance with Islamic and Jewish law,as they might object to eating it.

Mohammed Moussaoui, head of the French Muslim faith council, said Islam should ‘not become a target in the election campaign’.

Richard Prasquier, president of the 
representative council of Jewish institutions, has also expressed 
‘shock’ at the ‘stupefying’ claims being made by Mr Sarkozy and his colleagues.

Mr Sarkozy was also attacked for 
‘scape-goating and stigmatizing’ Muslims by Manuel Valls, communications
 chief for Mr Hollande’s campaign.

Mr Sarkozy is hoping he can win over 
those who currently vote for Marine Le Pen’ s National Front (FN), but 
his increasingly right-wing agenda is not making him any more popular.

Before
 his TV appearance on Tuesday night, a CSA poll suggested Mr Sarkozy 
would gain 46 per cent of the vote in a second round run-off, compared 
to 54 per cent for Mr Hollande.

An
 editorial in Liberation, the Paris daily newspaper, said the French had
 ‘solidly and profoundly fallen out of love with the outgoing 
President’.

Staring at defeat? Mr Sarkozy trails his Socialist rival Francois Hollande in all opinion polls

Miss Bruni did not help matters when she leapt to her husband's defence as he watched him face searching questions during the TV debate.

When Mr Sarkozy was criticised for celebrating his election success in 2007 with rich businessmen friends in an upmarket restaurant on the Champs Elysee, she told journalists: 'We are modest people.'

The comment, which was published in a number of Paris newspapers today, was described ironically by the Nouvel Observateur as 'a shock argument'.

Italian-born Miss Bruni is not only the benefactor of a multi-million pounds fortune built up by her industrialist father, but also made a fortune as a supermodel during the 1990s.

She is frequently likened to Marie Antoinette - the royal who was infamously said to have advised poor people without bread to 'eat cake'.

Mr Sarkozy, meanwhile, increased his presidential salary by 140 per cent as soon as he came to power, and then took a holiday on a yacht belonging to a billionaire friend.

He and Miss Bruni, who married followed a whirlwind romance in 2008, have since spent millions in taxpayers' money on everything from refurbishing their presidential plane to lavish parties.

Two years ago it emerged that they were spending more than £650 a day on fresh flowers for the Elysee Palace alone.

The couple also used taxpayers' money to settle £3,000 worth of fines for late payment of electricity and gas bills.

Their regular holidays have included staying in a £2,000-plus hotel suite in Mexico, as well as spending the whole of August at Miss Bruni's villa on the French Riviera.

Internet news sites were today crammed with comments about Miss Bruni's 'modest' claim, with a poster called 'Jambon' from Nice saying: 'The couple have always taken us for imbeciles.'

Marc, from Aubervilliers, added: 'Frankly, which planet does she live on? The hour of democratic judgement is coming.'

Despite once describing herself as a Socialist supporter, Miss Bruni has been campaigning on behalf of her husband in recent weeks, describing his policies as 'fabulous'.
