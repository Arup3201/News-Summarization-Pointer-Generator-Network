Three-time Olympic Gold medalist Kerri Walsh Jennings gave birth to a little girl early this morning, adding a daughter to her family of two young boys with husband Casey Jennings.

'Scout Margery Jennings is as beautiful as can be,' she excitedly revealed her baby’s name on her Facebook wall on Saturday.

'She came in like lightening and is all ready a beautiful rainbow ;) so pink & lovely & healthy.'

Growing family: Olympic Volleyball star Kerri Walsh, seen with her husband Casey Jennings in February, gave birth to a baby girl on Saturday morning

Summer of surprises: Walsh took home her third gold medal at the 2012 London Olympic Games in August before later realizing she was five-weeks pregnant at the time

A rep told People magazine that both mom and baby are 'healthy and resting.'

Walsh shares a 3-year-old son, Joey, and 2-year-old son, Sundance, with Jennings who's also a professional volleyball player.

The couple announced their pregnancy in September after Walsh took home her third gold medal at the London games.

She was five weeks pregnant at the time, she later revealed to NBC’s Matt Lauer.

'When I was throwing my body around fearlessly, and going for gold for our country, I was pregnant, and today I'm 11 weeks pregnant,' she said.

She noted not knowing she was pregnant at the time but suspected something was up while feeling 'unreasonably moody,' she said.

'Thank you all so very much, with all my heart, for your love, support & prayers. I can't tell you how much it means to me & how very much it helped. Wishing you all a wonderful, blessed day as this day certainly is for us,' she wrote on Saturday.
