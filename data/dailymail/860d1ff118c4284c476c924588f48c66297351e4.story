A Minnesota farmer turned the snow that was ruining his greenhouses this winter into a spectacular 50-foot snowman that is now attracting national media attention and visitors from miles around.

Greg Novak knew he had to clean up the nuisance snow, but he also thought it would be a great way to perk up his Gilman community deep in the winter doldrums.

Hundreds of hours and about five weeks later, people began flocking to Novak's farm as news of his impressive creation filled up newsfeeds, inboxes and social media across the web.

Practical solution? Novak decided to build the snowman he's dubbed Granddaddy after heavy Minnesota snows inundated his greenhouses

Popular: People eager to gawk at the snowman have flocked to the little central Minnesota town and a media frenzy has erupted around Novak's farm

'As long as you're moving it, might as well do something practical with it,' Novak remembers thinking.

Though anyone could debate the usefulness of a 50-foot snowman, the longtime farmer at least took to building the sculpture in a practical way.

Friends and family pitched in to help with Granddaddy, or to do farm chores while Novak worked on building the snowman using a skid loaders to pile snow and a silage blower to direct snow into stacked cylinders, the St. Cloud Times reported.

After the arduous but enjoyable labor of love, Granddaddy clocked in at an impressive 50 feet and people immediately took notice.

Gerald and Diane Harbarth were among the amused onlookers this past Sunday.

They drove more than 70 miles from Brownton to get a look at the mammoth snowman.

'This is unreal,' Gerald Harbarth told the Saint Cloud Times.

The Harbarths learned about Granddaddy on a television news report, 
but craning their necks to see it in person was something else entirely.

Novak
 took a break from the Minnesota snow with a vacation to Las Vegas, 
where he said he's even been contacted by the BBC and the Discovery 
Channel.

Novak told the St. 
Cloud Times that he's looking forward to flipping through the guestbook 
when he returns home to see how far people have come to gawk at 
Granddaddy.Â 

Heavy duty: Novak had help from friends and family. They used heavy machinery including this loader and even a silo conveyer belt to move the snow into giant plastic ring forms

Larger than life: Since a carrot just wouldn't do, Novak used a trash barrel for a nose

For Novak, that was the whole point of creating Granddaddy.

'It puts a smile on people's faces,' Novak said. 'When people smile, you know you've done a good thing.'

Granddaddy
 is but a mere child compared to efforts in the small community of 
Bethel, Maine, in 2008. Residents there claim the world record for the 
tallest snowperson, a 122-foot snowwoman named Olympia after the state's
 then-U.S. Sen. Olympia Snowe. ****

Granddaddy isn't record breaking, a Maine snowman was measured at 122 feet in 2008, but Novak insists that wasn't the point. 'It puts a smile on people's faces,' Novak said. 'When people smile, you know you've done a good thing.'
