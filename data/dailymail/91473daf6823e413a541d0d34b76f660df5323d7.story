President Barack Obama says he supports statehood for the nation's capital.

Obama was asked Monday about the prospect of the District of Columbia becoming the 51st state during a town hall at a city school.

The president said, 'I'm for it,' adding that he has been 'for quite some time.'

However, he's aware that it would be a tough one to sell in Congress.

I'm for it: President Barack Obama says he supports statehood for the nation's capital on Monday night

'The politics of it end up being difficult to get through Congress, but I think it's absolutely the right thing to do,' he said.

Obama has previously spoken in favor of giving the District voting representation in Congress, and the White House has consistently supported giving the local government full control of the city's budget and laws.

Following his re-election in 2012, Obama added District license plates with the phrase 'Taxation Without Representation' to his official vehicles.

He said he believed the people of D.C. should be represented like all other Americans.

'I think I've long believed that D.C. pays — folks in D.C. pay taxes like everybody else,' he said.

'They contribute to the overall well-being of the country like everybody else. They should be represented [in Congress] like everybody else,' Obama said.

'And it's not as if Washington, D.C., is not big enough compared to other states. There has been a long movement to get D.C. statehood, and I've been for it for quite some time.'

D.C. Vote executive director Kimberly Perry applauded the president's comments.

He told DCist.com: 'President Obama's support for D.C. statehood shows that he understands the injustice we face every day.

'The President has repeatedly proposed greater autonomy for D.C., only to see those proposals die because of partisan squabbling in Congress.

'We hope the administration will now request that its Senate allies hold a hearing on the D.C. statehood bill.'
