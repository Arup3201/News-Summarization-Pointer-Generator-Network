Huddled together with their arms around one another, these little monkeys look more than happy to pose for the camera.

The adorable images of the trio were taken at Jigokudani Monkey Park in Japan.

The attraction is a hotspot for tourists who visit the park in their droves to see the snow monkeys - also known as Japanese Macaques - bathing in the park's natural hot springs.

Ready for our close up: The adorable images were taken at Jigokudani monkey Park in Japan - a hotspot for tourists who visit the park in their droves to see the snow monkeys bathing in the parks hot springs

And it seems the primates have become so
used to their photo being taken they are now naturals in front of the 
camera, having perfected their poses.

So when husband-and-wife Chinping and
Yihfang Goh from Reading, UK, went to photograph the snow monkeys at 
the park they were more than happy to oblige.

The threesome had their arms wrapped around each other and pressed their little furry faces together for the photo.

They are are drawn to the welcoming waterhole to warm up during the winter.

The group descend from the steep 
cliffs and forest to sit in the warm waters of the onsen - hotsprings - 
before returning to the security of the forests in the evenings.

Jigokudani is located in a 
mountainous area in central Japan and at 850 metres in elevation, it is a
harsh environment where snow covers the ground for one-third of the 
year.

It is named Jigokudani, Hell's Valley, due to the eerie spectacle of boiling water and steam rising from the steep cliffs.
