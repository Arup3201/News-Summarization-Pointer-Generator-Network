George Osborne has started wearing a hi-tech wristband which makes sure he gets a good night’s sleep.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer revealed he uses the UP wristband to monitor his sleep patterns and track his fitness regime.

The black plastic Jawbone wristband links up with a smartphone app to allow users to take a ‘holistic approach to a healthy lifestyle’.

Grilling: George Osborne was seen wearing the black wristband while giving evidence to the Treasury select committee

Worries that senior ministers are struggling to sleep at night seem to be spreading in government.

It has emerged that Education Secretary Michael Gove has also taken to wearing a Jawbone wristband.

Mr Osborne’s black version was first spotted as he gave evidence to the Treasury select committee this morning.

It
was visible under the cuff of his right sleeve as he was grilled on his
plans for tax and spending. He has also been seen wearing it while out 
running.

Later he told 
journalists that the gadget, which costs around £100, was given to him 
as a birthday present when he turned 42 in May.

What it shows

The technology works by monitoring 
whether the user is in deep or light sleep and only wakes them at the 
best time so they start the day feeling refreshed.

It
also monitors physical activity 24/7, providing a record of the 
Chancellor’s morning jog around St James’ Park near the Treasury.

It
also makes it ‘fun and easy’ to keep track of what users eat, although 
it is not known if he used it to record eating a Byron burger in the 
Treasury on the eve of his Spending Review speech last month.

The up device links in to a smartphone app which provides an on-screen 'daily dashboard'.

Gift: The Chancellor revealed the £100 Jawbone gadget was a gift for his 42nd birthday in May

Active: The gadget tracks the wearer's movements 24 hours a day, including when the Chancellor goes jogging in central London

Manufacturers Jawbone say that the system 'not only visualizes your information so you can understand the meaning behind the numbers, it also discovers hidden connections in the way you live to deliver powerful insights. Over time, insights lead to new behaviors and new behaviors become new, healthier habits'.

The wristband tracks movements during sleep to record periods of light and deep slumber and waking moments during the night.

Its precision motion detection system captures a complete record of daily activity - or inactivity. Users can create a database of their diet by scanning barcodes and taking photos of their meals.

Nutrition: The app can also be used to track what the user eats, including the Byron burger the Chancellor was pictured eating on the eve of his Spending Review last month

Mr Osborne explained why he was using it as he addressed a press gallery lunch with journalists in Westminster.

He said: ‘It was a birthday present. It measures how far you walk but it also measures your sleep patterns, your deep and light sleep.

‘I was pleased to note yesterday that Michael Gove was also wearing one.’

Asked how it is helping him to relax at night, the Chancellor replied: ‘I always sleep well.’

The UP device markets itself as a way to 'KNOW YOURSELF LIVE BETTER'

There have been portable fitness gadgets on the market for many years now, but the Jawbone UP was the first designed to live full-time with its user.

First released in 2011, it was withdrawn because of technical problems.

After being totally re-engineered, it was relaunched the following year.

However some blogs and reviews have claimed that the new, remodelled wristband still has glitches, with some people saying theirs stopped working shortly after buying the product, others claiming it records false information and some complaining it disrupts their sleep.

Costing around £100, the portable personal trainer tracks a person’s eating habits, sleep and exercise - syncing with an app on a user’s mobile phone to offer advice about how to be healthier.

From the moment a person wakes - by vibrating at the 'best' possible moment according to sleep patterns - the machine monitors everything they do, prompting the wearer to get up and move if they have been sat still, and even to 'log' everything they eat.

Jawbone describe the UP as 'attractive, durable, water-resistant and unobtrusive' and even suggests it can be worn with a cocktail dress as easily as with gym kit.

Inside the wristband is a motion sensor which stores steps, calories burned, distance, and active versus inactive time.

The motion sensor even tracks the user while they sleep - tracking their movement to gauge when they fall asleep, how long it takes, and how much deep sleep they’re getting. 

If that wasn't enough, the iPhone app prompts the user to take photographs of every meal, and tracks where, when and what they have eaten.

A 'Feed' screen on the mobile phone then offers an up-to-date stream of information about how a person is progressing with respect to your health.

It also links with online 'health challenges' to set you tasks to achieve during the week.
