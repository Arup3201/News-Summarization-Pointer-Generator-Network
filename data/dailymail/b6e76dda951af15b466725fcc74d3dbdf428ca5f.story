Despite Kim Jong Un's fiery rhetoric, it seems North Korea is still desperate to enjoy Western consumerism.

From bottles of 'crabonated' cola, to Bart Simpson t-shirts and Nike baseball caps, not-quite-perfect imitations of iconic American products can be found dotted throughout desperately poor communist state.

These rare images given an insight into
 the dysfunctional relationship the communist state has with its declared enemy 
the United States.

The five-year photo project was captured by French photojournalist Eric Lafforgue.

called North Korea vs. USA these rare pictures of life behind the 21st Century Iron Curtain show North Koreans grappling with the effect of American cultural influence which many, particularly the young, think of as fashionable.

When the 47-year-old began visiting the isolated nation in 
2008 he was shocked by the tragedies he discovered in the nuclear-armed state.

'When you mention America the first reaction is to say that the US are the enemy,' said Eric.

'North Koreans learn from the time they are kids that the USA is the main problem in their life.

'They
 are told Americans want to destroy them so most of them believe it. But
 when you start to speak with people, most just wish peace, not war.'

North Korea has faced increasing 
international criticism over its weapons development. Six-nation 
disarmament talks involving the Koreas, the United States, Japan, China 
and Russia fell apart in 2009.

Several
 rounds of U.N. sanctions have not encouraged the North to give up its 
small cache of nuclear devices, which Pyongyang says it must not only 
keep but expand to protect itself from a hostile Washington.

Tensions have escalated since it conducted its third nuclear test since 2006 in February.

Surprisingly for such a restrictive Marxist state, US icons are not banned from the streets.

However, to counteract the American consumer culture that filters into the country, mainly through neighbouring Chinese workers, North Koreans are subjected to anti-US propaganda by their Marxist government.

To evade the repressive North Korean security services Eric posed as a tourist shooting pictures for pleasure.

'I entered the country through a travel tour operator,' said Eric.

'I could not produce anything really subversive - that would be impossible. But everywhere I go, I try to show the human side of a country and what's going behind the headlines.'

Since then Eric has visited North Korea six times, most recently in September 2012.

Eric explained that because Western tourism is banned in the winter months many of his pictures were taken during the most recent window of opportunity before the rhetoric of nuclear war was issued by the North Korean leadership in recent weeks.

Since being exposed as a member of the press, Eric is effectively banned from entering the country.
