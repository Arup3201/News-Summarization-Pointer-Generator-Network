Just imagine what the police officers must have thought when they arrived at the scene of a fish and chip shop fight, only to find the situation had already been resolved by Batman and Buzz Lightyear.

Aria Nouri, 33, of Stockport, Greater Manchester, was serving in the early hours when a group of about 20 youngsters began scuffling, so he called the neighbouring pub landlord Steve Lowe, 53.

But he was unaware that the Horse and Jockey pub was holding a fancy dress party, with Mr Lowe dressed as Batman and his assistant barman Shane Lee, 30, kitted out as the Toy Story character.

Mr 'Lowie' Lowe was said to have manhandled the group out of the Stop Inn chip shop, before Mr Lee blocked the doorway and left them on the pavement. Nobody involved wanted to press charges.

Mr Nouri said: ‘I put the call in as soon as the fight started and Lowie is very good, but I never expected him to turn up in a cape as Batman. Someone else called the police.

‘Lowie just flew in dressed as Batman and got the crowd out of the chippy. He got hold of the main two fighting and nobody could believe their eyes as it was a case of Batman to the rescue.

‘The costumes were brilliant and everyone was stunned when they turned up. The youngsters had been drinking, but nobody even thought about throwing a punch at Batman.’

Mr Lowe, who lives above the Horse and Jockey pub on Hazel Grove, said: ‘I don’t think anyone was expecting Batman to come to the rescue - the look on some of their faces was a picture.

‘They were in their late teens and early 20s and may even have thought they had had a night out in Gotham City as they had all had a good bit to drink.

‘When the police arrived their jaws just dropped and I told them nobody is pressing charges.

‘A policeman pal of mine later told me that it was reported as an incident and the log said something like: “Large scale disturbance Hazel Grove Stop Inn chippy - a lot involved, but no further action needed... Batman sorted it”.

‘It wasn’t funny at the time, but I can see the comedy in it now.’

Personal trainer and part-time barman Mr Lee said: ‘It was sorted before the police arrived and they were there in about seven or eight minutes.

‘I just stood in the doorway and stopped people getting back in the chippy. Batman was the real hero.’

Shopkeeper Aziz Rehman, 32, who was also at the fancy dress party but without a costume, added: ‘I really wished I’d had a Robin outfit on, but I was just stood outside backing them up.

Famous scene: The pair's valiant attempts were reminiscent of when Del Boy and Rodney emerged from fog dressed as Batman and Robin and scared away thieves trying to rob a woman in Only Fools and Horses

‘It was comical when Batman grabbed the culprits - he’s a big bloke anyway, but the costume was packed with extra muscles. Nobody even thought about messing with him.

‘They’d have been mad to throw any more punches. We had Jessie the Cowgirl from Toy Story in the bar, but she just thought Buzz Lightyear was an even bigger hero when they got back in.

‘I really don’t think the police could believe their eyes. When Batman tells you to behave - you’ve got to listen.’

A Greater Manchester Police spokesman confirmed that officers were called to a disturbance which was resolved by the time they arrived.
