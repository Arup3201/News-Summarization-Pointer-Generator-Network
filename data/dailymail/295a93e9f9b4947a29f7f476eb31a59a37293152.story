A power failure at Stansted Airport has caused delays to the departure of Christmas holidaymakers.

The failure has affected one of the satellite buildings at the Essex airport and the track transit which is used to take passengers to the outer  buildings for boarding.

Stansted said neither the main terminal nor the runway were affected and that passengers were being taken by bus to their flights.

On Christmas Eve last year a power failure caused by flooding at Gatwick airport in West Sussex led to severe delays and a number of flight cancellations.

As efforts continued to restore power, Stansted reported that flights were operating, but with some delays. 

Twitter user Jennie Thomas posted an image shortly before 5.30pm of a packed terminal with the message: 'The scene at Stansted Airport with no flights currently going in or out due to a power failure. Merry Xmas everyone!' 

Another Twitter user @dazedbyitall said, 'Armed police holding back crowds at Stansted Airport as power cuts cause chaos ... Turning ugly,' although a picture was not posted to back up the claim. 

Elsewhere, Christmas chaos was averted when a strike by airport staff at Gatwick, Heathrow and Manchester airports was been called off this afternoon.

About four million Britons are heading overseas during this festive period, estimated the travel association Abta, a slight increase on last year.

Heathrow is the busiest British departure point with almost 700,000 passengers leaving between December 19 and Christmas Day.

Gatwick is expecting more than 1.7 million passengers to travel through the airport between December 19 and January 5.
