A married couple renewed their vows in Zimbabwe,Africa and in attendance was the bride's family accompanied by a slew of majestic elephants.

Cory Perkins posted his spectacular wedding photos captured by local photographer Christopher Scott on reddit under the username per1993 about a month ago, and was inundated with praise from fellow reddit users. The couple was married at the Chengeta Safari Lounge on November 30.

Perkins' photos gained so much attention that he was awarded his own Reddit AMA. He described himself on reddit as, ' the lucky guy who married the Zimbabwean in Africa on elephants!'

Perkins and his wife of three years, Lynette, decided to go back to Africa so that she could see her family and so that they could help her community in Africa by building a safe house for young girls affected by the AIDS epidemic.

'First, we went to a place called Tsholotsho to build a safe-house for young girls who have been abused. (Because there is a myth in Africa that if a man with HIV sleeps with a virgin, he will be healed) After a week of building, the project was completed and we went on to Harare to finally meet her family and have our African Wedding Celebration. We then went on the Vic Falls for the Honeymoon,' wrote Perkins on his reddit.

Corey, an event planner for an international ministry, knew he would travel back to Africa at some point and took the humanitarian project as his impetus for going.

'I was able to do humanitarian aid project for the ministry in 
Zimbabwe,' he explained, finally being able to solidify plans for their 
exotic excursion. 'So we planned this huge three-week trip.'

This is the first wedding the bride's family was able to attend, reports ABC news.

'Because her family couldn’t make it over to the states, and we were in the middle of a green card process so she couldn’t leave the country until that was completed, we had a small ceremony in Pennsylvania,' Corey told GoodMorningAmerica.com of his initial wedding celebration three years ago.

'We had a small wedding with just my close relatives. It was only my side of the family.'

The wedding in Zimbabwe hosted 150 guests. This wedding was a mix of both modern and traditional.

This is the first time Corey met his brides family but says he felt like he knew them 'the entire time'

'We made the decision early on to have a mix of a westernized wedding and the traditional African wedding,” Corey said . 'We told the people attending to wear African attire and we had traditional African dancers which people really enjoyed.'

The couple decided to get married beneath a giant tree because they thought the setting was the most scenic. The safari lodge provided all of the elephants.

Corey told ABC that everyone had a great time, including Lynette's grandmother.

'One of the coolest things was throughout the entire ceremony and 
reception, everyone from Lynette’s family, even her 98-year-old 
grandmother who just had hip surgery, was dancing the entire time,' 
Corey said of their magical day.

The happy couple met when they were both
 at college at Seton Hill University in Pennsylvania when they were both
 on athletic scholarships, reports My Modern Met.

This is the first time Corey has met the bride's family but he said,' It feels like I've been part of the family the entire time.'

The couple honeymooned in Victoria Falls.
