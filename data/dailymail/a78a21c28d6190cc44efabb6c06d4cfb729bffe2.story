American Hustle director David O. Russell was called a 'loon' for 'feeling up' his transgender niece's breasts, in new emails leaked by Sony hackers.

Russell, according to the message, 'got in trouble' for the act, which a gossipy executive discussed alongside an anecdote of him bringing actress and director Sally Field to a party and making her cry.

Beleaguered co-chairman Amy Pascal was sent the message by Columbia Pictures executive Michael De Luca discussing the incident involving 19-year-old Nicole Peloquin, according to the New York Post's Page Six. 

'Got in trouble': The emails dealt with American Hustle director David O. Russell

'Felt up': Russell's niece Nicole Peloquin was on the wrong end of the director's wandering hands

It said: 'David’s a loon, talented, but geez once I saw him bring Sally Field to a party and reduce her to tears. Plus remember when he got in trouble for feeling up his transgender nieces [sic] boobs?'

The incident, which went public in 2012, did not result in criminal charges after Florida sheriffs investigated. 

Nicole Peloquin, who was born a boy, filed a police report after Russell groped both of her breasts while the two were working out at a hotel gym in Broward County on December 30, 2011, TMZ reports.

Peloquin, who was just 19 at the time and is not blood-related to Russell, said the encounter made her feel uncomfortable. 

Russell - who has always denied wrongdoing - claimed that the incident was consensual and happened after Peloquin, who was undergoing the transition from male to female at the time, complained that her breasts were different sizes. 

He also blamed her for calling police: 'Russell stated she is always causing drama since the transgender transformation and has become very provocative and seductive,' according to a police report. 

However, a family friend told TMZ that Peloquin called the cops because she felt 'violated by someone who was very close to her' and wanted him to be 'held accountable.'

The emails, extracted from Sony Pictures in an enormous security breach last month, have been leaked in batches by hacking group Guardians of Peace.

The latest round of correspondence was published Saturday night in what the hackers called a 'Christmas gift'.

They wrote: 'We are preparing for you a Christmas gift. The gift will be larger quantities of data. And it will be more interesting.

Disclosures: Amy Pascal, chairman of Sony Pictures, was revealed to have insulted President Obama and referred to Angelina Jolie (right) as a 'brat'

'The gift will surely give you much more pleasure and put Sony Pictures into the worst state.'

The latest rounds of revelations also included details of an embryonic Destiny's Child movie, a Kanye West biopic starring the musician himself, and a Spider-Man film featuring a female lead.

According to technology site Re/code, the new information will also deal with a 2006 acquisition of a video site called Grouper, later renamed Crackle.

Sony has been battered by the disclosures. Earlier dumps featured racist emails mocking President Obama, and insults directed at Will Smith's children.

Most of the exchanges involve Sony Pictures chairman Amy Pascal, who is now said to be fighting to keep her high-powered job.

Other disclosures included accusations that Leonardo DiCaprio is 'despicable' for pulling out of a film, and a description of Angelina Jolie as a 'minimally talented spoiled brat'.

Further disclosures have centered on the upcoming release of The Interview, a film depicting the assassination of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.

George Clooney has also been sucked in to the growing Sony email hack maelstrom after emails emerged showing he was  mortified by the failure of 2014 film The Monuments Men, which he co-wrote. 

In an email to Ms Pascal, Clooney begged for 'protection from all the reviews' as critics began to widely pan the Second World War drama.

'Let's just make it a hit. I haven't slept in 30 hours. And it's 7 am,' he told the Sony co-chairman.

'I fear I've let you all down. Not my intention. I apologize. I've just lost touch,' he wrote, according to the Independent. 'Who knew? Sorry. I won't do it again.'

Pascal reassured Clooney, saying: 'We will protect you by making money… that's the best revenge.'

Despite the WWII film, which is based on a true story, only receiving a 31 per cent rating on movie review site Rotten Tomatoes, it still had worldwide gross takings of $154,984,035.

The film, which had a $70million budget, is said to have made $78million in the U.S. and $76million overseas. 

Exchanges reveal pressure was applied to director and star Seth Rogen to change the death scene.

Some have claimed that the hackers are linked to the North Korean regime.

In other leaks, a hilarious email apparently from Channing Tatum showing the actor's enthusiastic reaction to the box office earnings of his comedy sequel, 22 Jump Street, has been revealed.

Box-office winner: 22 Jump Street had the second-highest opening weekend at the box office for an R-rated movie, behind only The Hangover Part II

'F YOU TED !!!! SECOND OF ALLLL TIMMMMME BEEEOTCH!!!! COME ON JUMPSTREETERS WE GOT CATE BLANCHETT WIT DIS BOX OFFICE B****ES!!!!!!!!' read the beginning of the e-mail.

The mention of Cate Blanchett in the e-mail was a reference to a joke in 22 Jump Street, where Tatum's character, Greg Jenko, didn't have 'Cate Blanchett with the budget'.

After few seconds of confusion, Jonah Hill's character, Schmidt, quietly corrected Jenko, saying he meant 'carte blanche'.

Meanwhile, Channing's 'F YOU TED' referenced the Mark Wahlberg movie, released in 2012, which was knocked down a spot in the opening-weekend rankings by 22 Jump Street.

With $57.1 million earned, 22 Jump Street landed behind only 2011's The Hangover Part II in opening weekend box offices for adult-themed comedies. 

In a separate revelation, it was also revealed that Beyonce's father approached Sony with plans to make a film about the early life of his daughter and her group Destiny’s Child. 

Another repercussion of the hack has been the alleged collapse of Sony's financial systems. 

According to reports on Friday, the company is now unable to process transactions, which has led to external companies canceling film shoots. 

Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin condemned the releases, saying news outlets who published details taken from hacked emails as 'morally treasonous and spectacularly dishonorable'.

He also denied accusations stemming from an email sent by Ms Pascal claiming that he was 'broke' and having an affair with a woman whose book he was hoping to use as a source for his next screenplay.

The hack attack against Sony Entertainment is airing the film studio's dirty laundry in public - revealing. Revelations from tens of thousands of emails - many of them from Sony Pictures co-chairman Amy Pascal - have rocked Hollywood for nearly two weeks.
