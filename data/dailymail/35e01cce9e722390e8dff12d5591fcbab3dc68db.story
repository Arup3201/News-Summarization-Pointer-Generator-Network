Prosecutors are to reconsider a decision not to bring charges in the case of Jimmy Mubenga after an inquest found he was unlawfully killed as he was deported from Britain.

Mubenga, 46, was on a British Airways flight bound for his native Angola when security guards noticed he was not breathing and stopped the plane on the runway.

The father-of-five later died in hospital and today an inquest jury recorded a majority verdict of unlawful killing.

After the verdict was announced, the Crown Prosecution Service said it would now reconsider its original decision not to bring criminal charges in the case.

Killed: Jimmy Mubenga, who died aged 46 after being restrained on a flight to Angola, was unlawfully killed, an inquest jury found today

Mr Mubenga, who was being deported after serving a jail sentence for committing actual bodily harm, was being restrained on the flight in October 2010 by three G4S guards, Terence Hughes, Stuart Tribelnig and Colin Kaler.

They said they restrained him when he attacked one of them soon after boarding the plane

But the inquest jury, sitting at Isleworth Crown Court in west London, heard that Mr Mubenga was calling out for help and shouting that he could not breathe.

Mr Mubenga died of cardio-respiratory collapse, where the heart stops beating and a person stops breathing, the inquest found.

Other passengers on board the flight said they heard Mr Mubenga wailing for help after saying he could not breathe, with one of the guards apparently replying: 'Yes, you can.'

No charges have ever been brought against the security guards, despite Mr Mubenga’s widow claiming that somebody ought to be held responsible for his death.

Three G4S guards - Terence Hughes, Stuart Tribelnig and Colin Kaler - accompanied Mr Mubenga on the flight

The Angolan was being deported after he serving a prison sentence for assault.

Mr
Mubenga and his wife, Adrienne Makenda Kambana, had been living in 
Ilford, east London, after arriving in the UK from Angola in 1994.

He was in the process of applying for 
permission to stay in the country permanently when it was decided he 
should be deported after serving two years in jail for assault 
occasioning actual bodily harm.

Returning the verdict of unlawful killing, the jury foreman said: 'Based on the evidence we have heard, we have found Mr Mubenga was pushed or held down by one or more of the guards.

'We find that this was unreasonable force.

Adienne Makenda Kamana, Jimmy Mubenga's widow, said he was 'a good friend, a good man, a good husband'

'The guards would have known that they would have caused harm to Mr Mubenga, if not serious harm.'

An
inquest jury of seven men and three women a recorded a majority verdict
of nine to one of unlawful killing after four days of deliberations 
following an eight-week hearing.

Mrs Kambana said outside court that her late husband was treated 'worse than an animal' on the flight, and called for deportations to be monitored better.

She said: 'He was neglected on the plane worse than an animal.  What the witnesses said, they heard Jimmy asking for help. Nobody helped him.

'Jimmy should be here, but because he didn't get help, that's why he's not here.'

She said although Mr Mubenga had served a prison sentence for assault, he did not deserve to die for his crime.

'It's not worse than someone killing someone, because he didn't kill anyone,' she said.

'He was a good man, a good friend, a loving husband. He treated me well.'

A G4S spokeswoman said: 'The death of anyone in our care is deeply felt by all of us and the death of Mr Mubenga was a very tragic event.

'The welfare of those in our care is always our top priority and we take great care to ensure that our employees on this contract, which has been carried out by another provider since November 2011, were made aware of their responsibilities in this respect.

'Our employees were also trained, screened and vetted to the standards defined by strict Home Office guidelines.

'We believe that at all times we acted appropriately and in full compliance with the terms of our contract with UKBA and it should be noted that the Crown Prosecution Service found no basis on which to bring criminal charges against G4S in this case.

'It would not be appropriate for us to comment on behalf of our former employees who were separately represented throughout these proceedings.'
