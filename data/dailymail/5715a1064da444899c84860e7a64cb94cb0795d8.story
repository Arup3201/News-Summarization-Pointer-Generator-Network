A woman whose breakthrough treatment of a bone disease with penicillin led to modern medical practices died on March 1 -- two days before her 83rd birthday.

Genean Hixon was one of the first American civilians to be treated with the drug, The Denver Post reports.

Hixon, born Genean Smith on March 3, 1931, was hospitalized in July 1943 with severe osteomyelitis, the paper reports -- a bone disease then-considered incurable and possibly fatal.

Hixon spent several years hospitalized before she was treated with penicillin for osteomyelitis

Her daughter, Connie Hixon Davis, told the Post that her mother spent more than four years in hospital beds in her teens but was saved by the treatment.

Hixon was subsequently known as the 'Penicillin Girl' after being treated with the drug. She reportedly received fan mail, and even a bouquet of roses from one soldier.

'Interestingly, she developed an allergy to penicillin and couldn't take it in her later years,' Hixon Davis told the paper.

Penicillin, which was used to treat Hixon's osteomyelitis, is now considered a standard treatment for the bone disease

Claude Smith, Genean Hixon's father, along with a doctor reportedly convinced the National Research Council to share penicillin with his daughter, the Post reports. At that time, the drug was reserved mainly for the military.

On February 19, 1951, Hixon met future husband Donald Hixon, whom she married later that year, the paper reports. The couple went on to have six children together.

Hixon was diagnosed with liver cancer in December, causing her death. She is survived by her husband, brother Gerald Smith, 79, 11 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren, according to the Post.
