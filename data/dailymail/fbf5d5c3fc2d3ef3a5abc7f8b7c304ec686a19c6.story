Say goodbye to traipsing around the shops or spending hours online searching for the right Christmas present, as more people admit they are giving homemade gifts this year. 

Thanks to TV shows such as Kirstie Allsopp's Homemade Christmas, families are going back to basics to save cash and give presents with a personal touch.

Almost a third of the nation (29 per cent) will receive a handcrafted present this Christmas, with cards, jam, chutney and knitwear among the most popular, according to a survey.

Programmes such as Kirstie's Homemade Christmas have inspired Brits get inspired to craft their own gifts

More than one in four (26 per cent) are turning to 'upcycling' to create unique gifts. And one in six (17 per cent) will either host or attend a Christmas craft party this year, the study of more than 1,000 people revealed.

However, the hard work isn't going to waste, as more than half (57 per cent) of people believe receiving a handcrafted present means more than something bought on the High Street or online.

The most popular homemade gifts include hand-painted candle holders, gift baskets and homemade Christmas cards.

As well as gifts, crafty Britons also plan on customising decorations for their home with 16 per cent planning to pick up a paint brush this year to embellish their own baubles, photo frames and nativity scenes. 

On average, Brits who make their own gifts save £40.38 compared to High Street and online spenders

It's likely they'll be painting names onto gifts as 54 per cent of people prefer to receive a present that is personalised, with 49 per cent liking their name to be included and more than half (59 per cent) receiving a gift painted their favourite colour.

Nearly two-thirds of the women polled (63 per cent) say that receiving a homemade present means more to them than a shop bought gift. And 30 per cent of men plan to give someone a handmade gift this year.

Crafting your own presents is also cost effective too, with the research suggesting people who make Christmas gifts at home save an average £40.38 compared to High Street and online spenders.

People believe the homemade trend has been sparked by design websites such as Pinterest with one in five (19 per cent) clicking for craft inspiration, while 25 per cent cited TV shows such as Kirstie Allsopp's Homemade Christmas as providing inspiration.

Though the research suggests we are often inspired by our friends efforts, with 30 per cent admitting they had been spurred into getting crafty by gifts people had previously received. 

Other sources of inspiration included  fairs (26 per cent) and magazines (25 per cent).

Johnny Corbett, senior marketing manager at Dulux, which carried out the survey, said that the sentimentality of a handmade Christmas has proved particularly appealing this year. 

'The analogy of a letter meaning so much more than an email has spread into Christmas presents this year with people across the UK looking to give their loved ones a present from the heart, not just from a High Street store.

'The personal touch is priceless and giving a personalised present will last much longer in the memory than a gift voucher, or the Christmas classic, a pair of socks.'
