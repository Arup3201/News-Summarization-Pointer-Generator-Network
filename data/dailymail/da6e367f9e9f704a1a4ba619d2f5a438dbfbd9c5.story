Horrendous: Mitchell Dorn (left) was arrested on Friday after allegedly beating a 3-year-old boy outside a Florida daycare

A man was arrested in Volusia County, Florida last week when witnesses saw him brazenly beating a toddler just outside a daycare center.

Witnesses say 31-year-old Mitchell Dorn dragged a 3-year-old boy out of a Deltona daycare, took him into his car and started hitting the child mercilessly.

One witness says the sight was so shocking that they had to turn away - but that they could still hear loud smacks and the small boy screaming.  

Dorn was arrested on Friday on child abuse charges, after investigators found bruising on the boy's arms and legs consistent with child abuse. 

Reports did not specify whether the boy was Dorn's son.  

Public records show that Dorn has been arrested more than 20 times in Florida since 2002, for charges including battery, resisting an officer and grand theft.
