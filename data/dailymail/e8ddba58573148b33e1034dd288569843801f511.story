They were the foot soldiers of the American Revolution, and are set to be at the center of new History channel miniseries Sons of Liberty.

And on Tuesday night a time capsule buried by war figures Paul Revere, Samuel Adams and William Scollay in 1795 was opened up, some 220 years after it was first put in the ground.

Officials at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts spent hours pouring through the 10-pound, corroded copper box and the artifacts inside.

Among the finds were five folded newspapers and at least 24 coins - dating from 1652 to 1855 - including half-cent, one-cent, half-dime, 10-cent and 25-cent coins.

Another set of coins included a pine tree shilling  and a copper medal showing George Washington.

An engraved silver plate contained a message from the men who left the box behind and as dated July 4, 1795.

It had been personally engraved by Paul Revere. 

There was also a seal of the Commowealth of Massachusetts, some cards

 and a title page from the Massachusetts Colony Records. 

The original capsule was made of cowhide and believed to have been embedded in a cornerstone when construction on the state Capitol building began in the same year.

Adams, the celebrated brewer, was governor at the time.

The contents were shifted to the copper box - measuring at 5½ inches by 7½ by 1½ - in 1855, which was only unearthed last month at the Statehouse.

Workers stumbled across it while doing repairs for a water leak at the building. 

Officials say old records and X-rays taken in December after the box was located and removed indicated the contents, so there were few surprises during the unveiling on Tuesday night.

The main mystery was the condition of the items, which experts believe partially deteriorated over time.

Pamela Hatchfield, a conservator at the museum, said the capsule initially was unearthed accidentally in 1855 when some modifications were made to the building, according to CNN.

'The paper is in amazingly good condition,' Hatchfield said as she went through the box.

Hatchfield said the tools she was using to remove objects from the time capsule included a porcupine quill, a bamboo tool and her grandfather's dental tool.

It took four hours just to loosen the screws on the box's lid, Hatchfield said.

She then spent at least another three hours looking through the capsule. 

Secretary of State William Galvin said notes from that era indicated that officials washed some of the contents with acid before putting them in the new copper box. 

He also said records show it was a humid day when the items were restored and the corner of the Statehouse where the capsule was reinstalled has had a water leakage problem for decades.

It's the second time capsule to resurface in Boston in recent months.

In October, a capsule dating to 1901 was uncovered in a lion statue adorning the Old State House. 

That contained newspaper clippings, letters and a book on foreign policy. 

The latest time capsule may be but back in the ground with its orginal items and some new things.

For now the items will be displayed at the museum until officials decide what to do with the capsule. 

Upcoming: Actors portray Revolutionary War soldiers in a scene from Sons of Liberty, a new miniseries premiering in January on the History Channel

New series: Sons Of Liberty will tell the stories of war figures Paul Revere, Samuel Adams and William Scollay

The History Channel will debut their miniseries Sons of Liberty later this month.

It is a three-part, six-hour series that tells the back stories of the Founding Fathers and their furtive efforts to turn a colony into a country. 

It will feature Revere's  famous ride of April 18, 1775, to warn the colonists the British were coming.

'Most people think of this time as a bunch of guys in wigs who got in a room and wrote up the Declaration of Independence, but it is so much more than that,' Dirk Hoogstra, the History Channel's general manager, said.

'I’m not sure people really understand how crazy it was to make the decision they made to go to war with the most powerful military in the world, being untrained and unorganized.'
