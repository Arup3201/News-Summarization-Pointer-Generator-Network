Known as a master of the occult, Dennis Wheatley became one of the world’s most successful authors by injecting his thrillers with a strong dose of the macabre. 

Now he has been unmasked as a real ‘spook’ whom the secret services commissioned to write an anti-communist novel aimed at Arab readers.

He was paid in cash for Of Vice And Virtue, published in English and Arabic at the height of the Cold War by a government keen to resist communism in the Middle East.

And he was so worried he would be mugged when he left the Foreign Office he had the banknotes sewn into his suit.

Wheatley enthusiast Charles Beck, who owns the only known English and Arab versions of the 1950 book, said: ‘Logic dictates that this may well have been MI6.

'I found it extraordinary that our Government was promoting Islam to counter communism back in the 1950s.’

The plot centres on a Russian diplomat who tries to defile a young Arab girl. After killing him, she is charged with murder.

But she is cleared by a magistrate who cites a verse from the Koran that says ‘every woman has the right to defend her honour by any means’.

Mr Beck tracked down the English typescript last November when Wheatley’s own collection of his works came up for auction.

A couple of months later, he obtained 
the only known Arab edition.

It had been in the possession of members of
 Wheatley’s family, who had extensive links with MI5.

Wheatley, who died in 1977 aged 80, was a prolific author.

His Gregory Sallust series was one of the main inspirations for Ian Fleming’s James Bond.

Bloomsbury Reader is to republish all of Wheatley’s works, many out of print for years.
