A lesbian couple in North Carolina was shocked to learn they had been targeted with homophobic hate speech.

Jennifer Mann and Jodi McDaniel have lived together in Canton, North Carolina, for four years with no issues, until Jennifer's 17-year-old son Dakota Bonham came home one day with shocking news.

Their home was labeled as 'fagits live here' on Google Maps.

Unacceptable: The lesbian couple's home was labeled 'fagits live here' on Google Maps

Even worse, Google was no help at all.

'I just thought, "Are you kidding me?"' Jennifer told the Citizen-Times. 

'I tried to contact Google, but I was put on hold forever and ever and ever. This day and time, with people and hate, you just can't live your life.'

Google did apparently respond on Wednesday however when the Citizen-Times contacted the company, and said they had taken down the slur.

It is still uncertain though who put this horrific label on Google Maps, as the county is saying they have nothing at all to do with the hate speech.

'Of course we would never have approved anything like that,' said Kathy Hoglen, addressing coordinator for Haywood County.

'We don't allow crude or offensive names of any kind.' 

Living their life: The couple has lived in the same home for four years and never had any problems they said

So in love: They are now considering possibly suing

The ladies are now wondering if it may have possibly been a Google worker who put in the slur.

Jodi says she has a window sticker of two pink deer that are facing one another, and that the sticker was visibly when the Google street mapping car came by their residence last summer.

The couple say they are considering legal action. 

'We live ordinary lives, just like everybody else,' said Jennifer. 

'Now it looks like I'm being a target.'

When Jodi called Google to try and get the situation remedied, they put her on hold and would not help her
