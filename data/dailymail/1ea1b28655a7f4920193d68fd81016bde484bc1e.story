A video of the incident was posted on YouTube following the game but has since been removed.

School officials investigated the incident and met with the coach, the player and his family, according to the Miami Herald.

Mr Guandolo told the Herald that he was 'just trying to fire him up, but you can't do it in today's day and age'.

The coach was upset over the incident, the school's athletic director revealed, along with the boy's parents who felt the whole thing had been blown out of proportion.

However the school saw fit to suspend the long-time coach and the district's superintendent released this statement on Monday: 'Upon becoming aware of the incident during the Cypress Bay football game, I immediately directed staff to look into the situation.

In accordance with District policies and procedures, the District will move forward with the following actions regarding Coach Mark Guandolo, which will include a three-day suspension from work and a two-week suspension from athletic activities.

'I expect every staff member to adhere to the highest professional standards in every aspect of their interactions with our students.'
