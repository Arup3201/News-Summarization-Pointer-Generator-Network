FIFA presidential candidate Jerome Champagne has said he wants England to host the 2030 World Cup in order to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the tournament.

The Paris-born Brighton fan, speaking to The Sun, said: 'The English Premier League is the best in the world because of its competitiveness.
