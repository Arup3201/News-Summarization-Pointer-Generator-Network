The dust storm, known as a 'haboob', reduced visibility to zero and led to mandatory evacuation notices for residents and businesses.

Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber has authorised the state fire marshal to send structural firefighters and equipment to help crews battle a wildfire that is threatening more than 130 homes in Jackson County.
