England's key World Cup qualifying tie against Poland descended into farce last night as heavy rain left the pitch unplayable - after officials ignored the weather forecasts and refused to close the stadium's retractable roof.

Thousands of fans who had travelled to eastern Europe for the game against Poland were left infuriated as officials stood and watched as a torrential downpour struck in Warsaw.

Heavy rain had been falling in the Polish capital for most of the day but still the roof of the £400million state-of-the-art stadium stayed open and gradually the playing surface disappeared under pools of water.

The match was eventually called off - but only after fans, and millions watching on television at home, were left waiting 45 minutes for the decision to be made.

Italian referee Gianluca Rocchi inspected the pitch at 8pm, when the match was due to start.

There
 was little prospect of play, but football's governing body FIFA was so 
desperate for the game to go ahead that the final decision was not made until 8.45pm.

Rain continued to fall and there was no chance of the match being played properly.

It was the first time that an England
 match had been called off due to the weather since 1979. The FA said 
the game would be played at 4pm on Wednesday instead.

The decision was greeted with derision by the fans who travelled to the game at Warsaw's National Stadium.

It also called into question the Polish authorities' decision not to close the stadium roof during the downpour.

Officials are reported to have claimed that the roof could not be closed because the wind and rain was too intense.

England coach Roy Hodgson claimed the pitch would take plenty of work to be playable tomorrow.

He
 said on ITV1: 'I'm rather hoping there'll get it (the roof) closed now 
as quickly as possible and start to do some work on the pitch because at
 moment the pitch is in very poor condition.

'Water is lying on the surface. It's going to need a lot of attention if it's going to be playable tomorrow afternoon.'

The England boss said he was happy with the rescheduled time.

'I
 think it was the only decision that could be made,' he said. 'There're 
no other possibilities. You can't find dates at international level.

'The dates that are available are all taken up so you can't just suddenly decide we'll play it another time.'

'What
 you have to do is to try to organise to get the game played as quickly 
as possible. We'll have to go back to the hotel. We're disappointed.

'We
 prepared well for this start tonight as no doubt the Poles have too, 
but now we've got to do it all over again and hopefully we'll be as 
prepared tomorrow as we were tonight.'

England fans booked on to flights home 
were understandably angry because most of them will now miss the match. A
 lack of communication added to their annoyance as news finally filtered
 through that the game had been postponed for 20 hours because of a 
severely waterlogged pitch.

Former England manager Graham Taylor, in Warsaw working for the BBC, 
said: 'This is Monty Python. Both sets of supporters are being treated 
disgracefully. If I was a fan I’d be booing.

'I thought this was a prime example of how supporters are treated with such disrespect.

'What I mean by that is that it was pretty obvious from the moment the 
ref came on the pitch for the very first time that this pitch was not 
playable.

'You could see that, yet it was two and a quarter hours later before supporters were actually told it wasn't on.

The 2,000 travelling England fans 
were also left disappointed that Roy Hodgson and his players did not 
come out to see them in Warsaw.

Failing to acknowledge supporters is 
one of the details contained in England's new code of conduct but the 
players were changed and on their bus by the time the game was called 
off.

Supporters were left to find out details about the game via friends at home watching on television.

James Holland and Matthew Newton, both in the RAF and based at Lossiemouth in North Scotland, are just back from Afghanistan.

Mr Holland said: 'The FA advised fans to
 pack for rain on our fans' website so no-one can say that they weren't 
expecting rain. It's a disgrace.

'We had to take two different flights. We're working-class lads, this is a treat for us.'

Mr Newton said: 'What disappointed me most was the players could not be bothered to come out and see the fans.'

Brian Wright travelled from Coventry with his father, also Brian, and David Hartopp, flying from Birmingham to Katowice and then more than six hours on a minibus by road to Warsaw.

'The fact that we were getting our information from friends at home was a disgrace,' said Brian Jnr. 'There was only one announcement in English all night.

'Why didn't they shut  the roof? We knew it would rain.'

The FA's Adrian Bevington said compensation is 'something we are looking into, but I can't give any final decision on that'.

According to Polish journalists, home manager Waldemar Fornalik had asked for the roof to be left open on Monday because he thought the forecast rain would be a leveller against England.

Unfortunately the rain was much heavier than expected, leaving England without the majority of their travelling fans and Barclays Premier League clubs furious that their players will return from international duty a day late.

The problems were partly caused by the elaborate but severely flawed design of the stadium, and the fact that the roof cannot be closed when it is raining. In the dry it takes just 15 minutes.

When asked why the roof wasn’t used, Hodgson said: ‘I can’t answer that. It was pretty obvious early on that the game was not going to be played. For the Polish federation, it’s a disaster. They had a big crowd so there’s a problem in rearranging tickets for a match tomorrow.’
