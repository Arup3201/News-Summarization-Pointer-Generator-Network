An American woman has been granted a divorce from her Chinese entrepreneur husband in a high-profile case which highlighted the problem of domestic violence in China.

Kim Lee, 40, posted graphic photos of the injuries she said were caused by her husband Li Yang on her Sina Weibo account, the Chinese version of Twitter, before she filed for divorce. 

With almost 70,000 followers, Lee's first hand experiences of domestic violence at the hands of her husband Li Yang, split the nation.

Some felt she was right to go public while others believed she should have kept the abuse secret.

Yang is the multi-millionaire owner of 'Crazy English', a chain of English-teaching schools which are a household name in China. 

The photos of the bump on her forehead, bruises on her knees and a bleeding ear went viral and sparked tens of thousands of postings on Chinese Twitter-like sites, along with protests and talk show debates.

She inadvertently became a hero for women who have been victims of domestic violence because it is a subject not often talked about in China, where tradition holds family conflicts to be private. 

It is also hard to go public in a country where many still consider women subservient to their husbands.

But on Sunday a Beijing court granted the divorce on the grounds of domestic abuse and the court approved Lee's request for a three-month restraining order against Li.

Reports said the court ordered Li to pay his former wife 50,000 yuan (£6,000) compensation for mental anguish as well as child support. 

She will also have custody of their three daughters and receive properties worth more than 12million yuan (£1.2million).

A spokeswoman from the Chaoyang District People's Court confirmed the divorce but wouldn't give any details.

The China Daily quoted Lee's lawyer, Qi Lianfeng, as saying that the court's acknowledgement of the domestic violence will encourage more women 'to protect their rights in a legal way.'

Lee said she would continue to live with her children in China because her daughters have been educated here, the China Daily reported.

It is estimated that at least one in four women has experienced beatings at the hands of their husband in China and abuse thrives in a culture of secrecy that holds family conflicts private.

The expectation that all men are violent — or at least have the right to be violent — is common in parts of China.

As with many countries, men historically ruled the family, with authority over women and girls.

Communism brought new laws that gave women the right to work alongside men, and decades of economic growth have created dramatic shifts in Chinese society.

But inequities persist, particularly in rural areas.
