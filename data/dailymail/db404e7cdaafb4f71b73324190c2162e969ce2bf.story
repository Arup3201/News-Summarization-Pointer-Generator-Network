The animal kingdom is full of intricate mating rituals, from battling bulls to proud peacocks, but this bird's way of attracting a mate is truly 'magnificent'.

The male Magnificent Frigatebird spends most of the roosting season blowing up a huge red balloon-like pouch from his chest.

These proud chick-hunters were spotted by photographers, prancing for the ladies in a Florida county park.

Photographer Scott Helfrich said it 
was 'amazing' watching hundreds of the Magnificent Frigatebirds from a 
kayak near a known roosting spot.

Mr
Helfrich and a friend spent hours taking pictures of the sea birds - 
including groups of black males with their inflated scarlet pouches.

Mr Helfrich, a windows and doors sales specialist, took the shots at Fort DeSoto County Park, near Tampa.

The
married photographer from Deland, Florida, said: ‘My friend and I heard
about a island with hundreds of roosting frigatebirds and were keen to 
see the unusual birds.

‘We camped for a few days and did a lot of kayaking around the area until we found the spot on a little island in shallow water.

‘Luckily, we were able to paddle up right up to it and had a fantastic experience.

‘It made for a spectacular sight. The lighting was perfect for photography and the birds were more than co-operative with us.

‘We sat out there photographing them in every angle.

‘My favourite was the males flying right at us with their red pouches inflated.

‘It
looked just unbelievable. It was quite a sight for us and to top it off
we watched the sun go down during our paddle back the the dock.

‘Words
could not describe the feelings while watching all of this happen - it 
was like a dream and everything came together for a great experience.’

The Magnificent Frigatebird - sometimes known as a Man O'War - is widespread in the tropical Atlantic.

They
breed in Florida, the Caribbean and Cape Verde Islands, plua along the 
Pacific coast from Mexico to Ecuador, including the Galapagos Islands.

Frigatebirds grow to be 39 inches long with an 85 inch wingspan.

Males are all-black with a scarlet throat pouch that inflates like a balloon in the breeding season.

Females are black, but have a white breast and lower neck sides, a brown band on the wings, and a blue eye-ring.

The Magnificent Frigatebird is silent in flight, but makes various rattling sounds at its nest and never lands in water.

They feed mainly on fish but also attack other seabirds to force them to disgorge their meals.
