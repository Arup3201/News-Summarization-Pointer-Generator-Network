A mother of seven has beaten odds of almost one in a million to one by giving birth to seven children - all on different days of the week.

Amanda Phizacklea, 37, from Ramsden Street, Barrow, Cumbria, completed the set with the arrival of baby Eva, on a Wednesday.

She says her brood even match the child-by-child characteristics of the traditional Monday's Child poem.

The Phizacklea family including mother Amanda (centre right) with with newborn Eva and (l-r) Sam, 2, Rebecca, 19, Ben, 9, father Steve  with Lexi, 4, Jack, 7, and Lyndsey, 20, with her own daughter Elizabeth, 18 months

Amanda gave birth to baby Eva at 10.45pm on June 18 - a Wednesday.

She had already given birth to six other children, all of whom had been born on the other days of the week.

She said: 'My mother-in-law and I worked out a couple of weeks ago that my six children had been born on different days and that the only one missing was a Wednesday.'

Lyndsey, 20, who lives in Preston, Lancashire, was born on a Friday (19.11.93), Rebecca, 19, of Barrow, Cumbria, born on a Sunday (11.6.95), Ben nine was born on a Thursday (1.7.04), Jack, seven, born on a Tuesday (11.7.06), Lexi, four, born on a Monday (2.11.09), and Sam, two, born on a Saturday (14.1.12).

Amanda said she had joked with 43-year-old partner Steve, who is the father of Eva, Sam and Lexi, about needing the baby to be born on June 18 or June 25.

She added: 'Steve and I joked with the midwife that baby Eva would need to be born on either (June 18 or 25) to complete the collection.

'When I was in the hospital I saw that it was getting closer to midnight so I made a concentrated effort to push her out so we didn't miss the deadline.

'I said to the midwife "we have to push her out before midnight to have a Wednesday baby".

'I thought she was going to end up being born on Thursday morning, but we made it in time with an hour to spare.

SATURDAY Sam, two, works hard for a living (l) and SUNDAY Rebecca, 19, bonny and blithe and good and gay (r)

'It's really nice that this has happened. Someone joked that I should try for all the months of the year.

'I'm a bit of a numbers person and I was interested to work out what the chances were of this happening.'

The daughter of a family friend worked out there is a 823,543-1 chance of the occurrence.

Amanda added: 'It's nearly one in a million. It's obviously quite unusual. We didn't do it deliberately. I don't think you could even plan for it to happen.'

The mum also said that her children's personalities fitted in with the poem Monday's Child.She said: 'Their personalities fit in with the poem - it's really strange.'

The poem states that Wednesday's child is 'full of woe'.

Amanda added: 'I'm hoping she's not going to be miserable.

'She can pout already so maybe she will be a bit of a misery guts.'

Monday's child is fair of face,Tuesday's child is full of grace,Wednesday's child is full of woe,Thursday's child has far to go,Friday's child is loving and giving,Saturday's child works hard for a living,But the child who is born on the Sabbath DayIs bonny and blithe and good and gay
