For a certain generation, Kabaddi was a typical feature on Trans World Sport, but now the niche sport is set for the big time under the lights at the 02 Arena.

The newly formed World Kabaddi League launches in London this weekend and aims to drag the sport into the 21st century and the mainstream.

Set for the big time: Kabaddi will begin a new world league to open up at London's 02 Arena this weekend

Kabaddi is a blend of rugby without the ball, tag for grown ups, with wrestling thrown in.

It contains a mixture of tactical brainpower and beastly brawn.

The teams take turns sending a 'raider' into the other half. To win a point, the raider must take a breath, run into the opposing half, tag one or more members of the opposite team, then return to his home half before inhaling again.

The raider will chant 'kabaddi, kabaddi' with his exhaling breath to show the referee he has not inhaled.

The raider will be declared 'out' and will not gain the point if he inhales before returning to his side, or returns without touching an opponent.

The tagged defenders will be 'out' if they do not succeed in catching the raider who tagged them.

Defenders may not cross the centre line (the 'lobby') of the field and the raider may not cross the boundary lines. However, there is one bonus line which can grant extra points for the raider if he manages to touch it and return successfully.

Players who are out are temporarily sent off the field.

Each time a player is out, the opposing team earns a point. A team scores a bonus of two points (called a 'lona'), if the entire opposing team is declared out.

At the end of the game, the team with the most points wins.

It has a following of 100 million around the world mainly in South Asia and within the Asian diaspora. 

While the sport is big in India it has been played 'underground' around the rest of the world.

But the WKL seeks to change that this year as eight newly formed super teams compete in 14 cities in five countries over the next five months after which one of the sides will be crowned the first ever world Kabaddi champions.

The WKL begins on Saturday and Sunday at the 02 Arena and will be supported by  singers and dancers from Bollywood, including Akshay Kumar who co-owns one of the teams in London's Khalsa Warriors.

WKL has received enthusiastic backing from Labour MP for Ealing Southall Virendra Sharma said: 'I played it as younger man.

It’s a great game which in England is already being played by the white communities as well as being very big amongst Asians.

'It’s popular with women too.

'The formation of WKL can see the sport grow and I hope come the next Commonwealth Games it will be included and further down the line be recognised as an Olympic sport too.'

British based business man Talwinder Hayre, co owner of the Birmingham side, United Singhs added: 'I am confident that the formation of WKL will see Kabaddi take off.

'In five years our aim is for the sport to be up there with IPL cricket in terms of its popularity.'

After this weekend the WKL road show travels to Birmingham before moving onto New York and beyond.
