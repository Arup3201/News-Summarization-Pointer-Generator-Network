They say good looks run in the family and the Le Bons proved that as they took to Gyunel's catwalk last night.

Yasmin and Amber, the mother daughter duo whose good looks have made them world famous, opened the Azerbaijan designer's SS15 show at the Bloomsbury ballroom yesterday evening.

Watched from the front row by the likes of Millie Mackintosh, Roxie Nafousi, Rosie Fortescue, Lilah Parsons and Donna Air, the 49-year-old catwalk stalwart and her 25-year-old daughter were the perfect fit for the show, which aimed to convey a strong and adventurous woman.

The collection told the story of a nomadic traveler traversing the desert and shirt dresses, relaxed blouses and flowing maxis were appropriately emblazoned with scorpions, a symbol inspired by Gyunel Rustamova's Zodiac sign.

Hair too, created by Wella's team of stylists, was braided across the face to depict a scorpion – sounds creepy, looked cool (even Millie Mackintosh was coveting the look).

Gowns in midnight blue, maroon and beige were juxtaposed with sculpted separates, reinventing that much-loved sportsluxe vibe for SS15, while layers of crochet and leather gave the collection a tough edge.

The designer, who studied Economics before finding her calling at Central Saint Martins, also worked as an artist - a talent and passion that didn't go amiss on last night's catwalk.

Leather trousers and soft leather jackets in titian orange and brittle green were given an artistic edge, while chunky gold and silver jewellery adorned model's arms and necks.

'I like to think of the Gyunel woman as a nomadic traveler with a strong adventurous attitude,' said the Baku-born designer. 'I was inspired by the idea of journeys through places steeped in culture and the creatures that inhabit them.'
