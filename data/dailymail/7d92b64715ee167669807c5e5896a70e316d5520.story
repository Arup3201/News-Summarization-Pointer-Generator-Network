A bogus vet who ‘delighted in seeing animal innards’ has been jailed after cruelly inflicting excruciating pain on animals by carrying out botched operations.

Jayson Wells, from Grimsby, Lincolnshire administered unknown medications to animals - leaving cats, dogs, rabbits and birds so ill they had to be put down.

Wells, 30, had no proper training as a vet and had worked only as a herdsman - but conned owners into paying for his inept services all over the country.

Jayson Wells, 30, from Grimbsy, Lincolnshire, had no proper training as a vet and had worked only as a herdsman - but conned owners into paying for his inept services all over the country. He was jailed for 19 months

Grimsby Crown Court heard how the fraudster, who has been jailed for 19 months, seemed to delight in seeing animal’s innards and recommended controversial treatments such as a syringe of syrup of figs to improve the pets’ health.

Wells admitted two offences of causing unnecessary suffering to animals, three of fraud by pretending to be a fully qualified veterinary surgeon and another of practicing as a vet without a licence.

Fraudster: Wells administered unknown medications to animals - leaving cats and dogs so ill they had to be put down

Edward Bindloss, prosecuting, said Wells started committing the offences within a week or so of being released from prison in August 2012 for similar offences.

They included causing suffering to a pony which had to be put to sleep after a horrifically-bodged castration.

He was originally given a six-month suspended prison sentence by Boston magistrates but he was later jailed for breaching the terms of the order.

Wells had a sweatshirt with his name on it, business cards and he employed a woman who was supposedly a veterinary nurse - but he did not have any premises of his own.

Mr Bindloss said: ‘In reality, he was not registered to practise as a vet.

‘He had no qualifications but he told her he wanted to expand into the field of domestic animals.’

In
 September 2012, Wells became friendly with Mary Oglesbee, who at the 
time had been running a small cat rescue scheme, called Under The Paw 
Cat Rescue, since 2008.

One cat, called Martha, was injected on several occasions by Wells after being examined.

Martha was put to sleep by him in November 2012 after he claimed she was suffering from a stomach tumour.

In
 December that year, Wells offered to treat a Yorkshire terrier, owned 
by Paul Whitelam, but told him the dog had liver failure and should be 
put to sleep.

Mr Whitelam 
agreed and because he believed that Wells had done him and the dog a 
good service, paid him £20 instead of the £10 fee requested.

Mr
 Whitelam later became aware of bad Facebook comments about Wells and 
contacted the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, which had never 
heard of the supposed vet.

Wells cruelly inflicted excruciating pain on animals by carrying out botched operations and several had to be put down afterwards because it made them so ill. Two of the cats he unnecessarily injected later died (above)

He
 is believed to have contacted Miss Oglesbee because of a Facebook 
campaign she started about the fraudster and he was caught after an 
investigation by the RCVA.

The
 court heard that Wells also examined a pregnant cat, called Pumpkin, 
owned by Amy Baker and gave it injections. He also gave injections to 
kittens owned by Lisa Dove.

Some of the pets later had to be put down. Miss Oglesbee believes, however, that Pumpkin survived its treatment from Wells.

But, the injection of one of the cats 
belonging to Miss Dove went wrong and the needle snapped or bent, 
causing blood to spray out.

The cat became very distressed and was ‘literally coughing up its guts’.

Miss Dove believed the cat ‘must have suffered horribly’ before it died and said the sight would stay with her always.

She claimed Wells later ‘seemed to delight in what he was doing’ in showing her the cat’s innards.

Wells later gave a booster injection to one of Mrs Baker’s cats and he also told her to give it a full syringe of syrup of figs.

Its condition did not improve and a proper vet told her the cat was suffering from organ failure. It was put down.

Wells admitted two offences of causing unnecessary suffering to animals, three of fraud by pretending to be a fully qualified veterinary surgeon and another of practicing as a vet without a licence

Wells also injected a cat belonging to Deborah Atkins, a friend of Mrs Baker, and later claimed it had ‘very aggressive’ leukaemia.

He gave it injections but its health deteriorated and he said it would have to be put down. He injected it and the cat became more distressed before finally dying.

Wells, who also admitted failing to attend a previous court hearing, was jailed for 19 months. He was also banned from owning or keeping animals for seven years.
