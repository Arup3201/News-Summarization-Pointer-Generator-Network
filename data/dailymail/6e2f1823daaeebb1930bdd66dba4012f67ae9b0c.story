Duncan Millar stole £58,000 from the surgery where he worked because he felt he was underpaid

A practice manager who got into debt after the failure of his 23-year marriage stole £58,000 from an NHS doctor's surgery where he worked.

Former RAF serviceman Duncan Millar struggled after his parents died within one month of each other in 2006 and he got divorced, Sheffield Crown Court heard.

He tried to make a fresh start by becoming practice manager at Doctor Dilip Chatterjee's surgery in Shiregreen, Sheffield, and moved to a £179,000 house with his second wife.

But the father-of-two thought his salary was 'insufficient' and started taking money intended for patients by writing out cheques to himself.

Jim Baird, defending, said the couple's mortgage was £147,000 and his new wife, who worked as a nurse at the same surgery, paid 
the £30,000 deposit because Millar's divorce had left him with nothing.

They had repayments of £1,200 a month 
and Millar took out a £30,000 personal loan and ran up credit card debts of £5,000 to make ends meet.

Millar, who celebrated his 59th birthday yesterday, started taking small amounts from the surgery's funds in August 2009 and then it became regular almost on a weekly basis until March, 2012.

He went to cheque shops in Firth Park, 
Chapeltown and even Rotherham to obtain cash and would spend it 
immediately on household expenses rather than banking the proceeds.

'The final amount is something which completely amazes and shocks him,' said Mr Baird.

Millar, from High Green, Sheffield admitted fraud of just over £58,000.

Laura Marshall, prosecuting, said when 
arrested in June last year Millar told police he had been writing 
cheques to himself from the surgery's funds supplied by the local 
Primary Care Trust and cashing them for two years.

Millar ran up debts and stole from Dr Dilip Chatterjee's surgery in Shiregreen, Sheffield to make ends meet

Only the practice manage or the doctor had access to the account. He said Dr Chatterjee was often away in India and would leave him blank cheques to make out or he would forge the doctor's signature.

He could not tell police why he did it other than he had large debts and when he ran short he would just write out cheques.

Mr Baird said Millar had lost his reputation and exemplary good character and immediately admitted his crime when challenged.

He
joined the RAF at 17 and was a non-commissioned officer for 23 years 
serving in Germany and leaving with a long service and good conduct 
medal. He later helped veterans of the Bosnia and Gulf War conflicts.

Dr Chatterjee often travelled to India and left blank cheques which Millar wrote out to himself

After
leaving the RAF he retrained within the NHS and became a practice 
manager handling a budget of £1.5million without any problems at 
another surgery before moving to Sheffield.

'But the last six years have taken their toll and he's a broken man and a mere shadow of the man he was,' said Mr Baird.

He did not lead an expensive lifestyle
and still had large debts. His wife, who was the practice nurse, was on
long term sick leave for much of the period.

He was spared jail after Judge Rosalind 
Coe told him: 'Whether or not you felt you were being paid enough simply
taking money from the public was criminal behaviour.'

Judge Rosalind Coe said Millar had fulfilled a 'long and commendable service' for his country but it had ended unhappily 'not just for you and your family but this is public money you defrauded intended for the care of patients.'

She added that he had breached the trust placed in him, offended repeatedly and stolen public money but she weighed that against his previous good character, personal circumstances and his early guilty plea.

Millar was given an 18-month jail term suspended for two years, ordered to carry out 300 hours of unpaid community work and made the subject of an extended curfew.
