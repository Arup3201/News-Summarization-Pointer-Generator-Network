The Pope 'played a very important role' in opening up a dialogue between the United States and Cuba, says President Barack Obama.

'The Pope doesn't wield armies. He can't impose sanctions, but he can speak with great moral authority, and that makes a difference,' the U.S. president said in an interview that aired today on Good Morning America. 

'And it certainly made a difference in this case,' he added.

Pope Francis and President Barack Obama shake hands during a private audience on March 27, 2014 at the Vatican.  The meeting preceded talks between U.S. and Cuban officials in October at the Vatican that led to an announcement on Wednesday that the countries had reestablished diplomatic relations

Obama, consciously or not, channeled a famous Stalin statement about the power of the Pope.

Soviet Dictator Joseph Stalin is said to have written off the importance of the Pope in a conversation with French Prime Minister Pierre Laval and British Prime Minister Winston ChurchilI.

In his book The Second World War, Churchill writes that in 1935 Stalin told Laval flippantly, 'The Pope! How many divisions has he got?' 

While the Pope was not directly involved in the talks between the U.S. and Cuba, according to the White House, the Vatican played host to at least one discussion between 'high-level administration officials' from both countries 'in a meeting that was hosted by members of the Pope’s team.'

'We certainly welcomed their participation in these conversations, and the degree to which the Pope and his team facilitated this reconciliation is one that we appreciate,' Obama's spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday.

The White House also credited the Pope with helping to jump start talks in the first place through personal letters he wrote to both Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro.

According to the Vatican, the letters encouraged the two country's leaders to 'resolve humanitarian questions of common interest, including the situation of certain prisoners.' 

The Holy See also confirmed in a statement that the Vatican served as a meeting place for officials from Cuba and the United States in October.

Obama was not present at those discussions but he did travel to the Vatican to visit the head of the Catholic Church in March. 

The Vatican has confirmed that Pope Francis will make his first papal visit to the U.S. in September for a conference in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but it has not said if the trip with include a stop at the White House to see Obama.

Alan Gross embraces an entourage of family and friends who were awaiting his return from five years of captivity in Cuba to Joint Base Andrews on Wednesday. The United States and Cuba agreed on Wednesday to restore diplomatic ties that Washington severed more than 50 years ago, and President Barack Obama called for an end to the long economic embargo against its old Cold War enemy

In a statement to announcing the United States' intentions to 'end an outdated approach' to Cuba and its commitment to 'normalize relations' with the Communist country, Obama thanked the Pope for helping to break down the decades-long barrier of communication with the Castro regime.

'To those who have supported these measures, I thank you for being partners in our efforts. In particular, I want to thank His Holiness Pope Francis, whose moral example shows us the importance of pursuing the world as it should be, rather than simply settling for the world as it is,' he said.

In a statement of his own, Castro also name-checked His Holiness and acknowledged 'the support of the Vatican.

Upon hearing the news that Cuba had released American Alan Gross and more than 50 other political prisoners and that the U.S. planned to reestablish diplomatic relations with the country after 53 years, including the creation of a U.S. embassy in Havana,  the Vatican promised on Wednesday to continue helping the two countries improve their relationship.

'The Holy See will continue to assure its support for initiatives which both nations will undertake to strengthen their bilateral relations and promote the well-being of their respective citizens,' it said in a statement.
