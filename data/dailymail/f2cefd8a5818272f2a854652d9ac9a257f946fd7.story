The transfer of Luis Suarez to Barcelona may have given Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers the hard cash to make it a record-breaking summer of transfers at Anfield.

But the signing of France forward Loic Remy has been in the pipeline long before the arrival of Rodgers at the club.

The versatility of a player often likened to former Arsenal legend Thierry Henry was what made ex-Reds boss Kenny Dalglish enquire about Remy’s availability way back in 2011.

And the 27-year-old’s stock has only risen in the years since, scoring the goals for QPR and Newcastle United which have proven he can hack it in the Premier League.

He smashed six in 13 starts for a struggling QPR side eventually relegated from the top flight and bagged 14 in 24 starts for Newcastle last season.

Rodgers himself went after the Frenchman in January this year and again in March - long before Suarez departed for La Liga.

The forward’s goal return is clearly a draw as Rodgers seeks to fill the 31-goal gap left by the Uruguayan.

Crucially, though, Remy will also provide the pace, ability and willingness to play in any position forward of deep midfield, which appeals to the Ulsterman’s desire for his players to be interchangeable in a fluid, rotating system.

In and out: Remy will not be able to fill Suarez's shoes but he will offer Liverpool a different type of option

Versatile: The French striker's pace and ability to play across the front line is a key factor in his signing

It was this ability to take up any role asked of him - coupled with blistering pace - which made Remy a much better bet that Wilfried Bony.

Although primarily a striker, he can operate anywhere across the front line.

Remy featured in five different positions for Newcastle last season and that is a clear sign he will fit into a Liverpool attacking system that is likely to have Daniel Sturridge as its beating heart but with a mix-and-match group of players as its lifeblood.

Raheem Sterling assumed a key role during Liverpool’s title challenge last season after learning to be more flexible, while Philippe Coutinho earned rave reviews in the latter half of the season after showing a similar willingness to adapt.

Key pair: Suarez and Sturridge formed an excellent partnership last season, something Remy wants to emulate

Rarely did they get in each others’ way as Liverpool smashed goals with abandon at the height of their resurgence; Remy will be equally expected to work out his place in this grand scheme.

There will be inevitable moments of confusion when Sturridge and Remy both pull wide and deep, or chase the same balls into the box. But Rodgers will trust them to come good, in time.

The Liverpool manager would not have spent the £8.5m on Remy if he were not confident there will be no long-term clash of styles, no fighting for the same positions.

It was a similar train of thought with the purchase of Rickie Lambert from Southampton last month.

Rodgers has always been happy to compliment how well his front line complement. Remy’s arrival will not change that.

Searing: Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge used their pace to rip teams apart last season

Irreplaceable: No one player was ever going to be signed to make up for the Uruguayan leaving

With Remy now signing on the dotted line for Liverpool, the work of his agent, Frederic Guerra, would appear done.

Guerra has previously wasted no opportunity suggesting his player would be he perfect match for Liverpool, but his sales-pitch from 2011 would appear to be perfectly aimed at Rodgers now.

'This boy is pure gold,' he said. 'And I am not just saying that because I am his agent.

'He has great pace and that is something Liverpool need in attack. He has his heart set on playing for Liverpool.'

If Guerra’s high-praise should come with the obvious health-warning of somebody pedalling self-interest, the words of former Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson perhaps carry more credibility.

Back in May this year, the Match of the Day pundit was proclaiming Remy as an ideal signing for the Reds.

'Personally, I would take him all day long,' he was reported as saying. 'He would provide a perfect option as he is such a good player.'

Lawrenson was commenting in the knowledge that Liverpool will be tested by a challenge for honours on four fronts next season following their return to the Champions League.

Prior to joining QPR in January 2013, Remy was a regular for Marseille in the Champions League, scoring four goals in 16 appearances in the competition. He also played for the French club in the Europa League.

In buying Remy, nobody, especially, Rodgers will believe he has signed a direct replacement for Suarez.

But the Northern Irishman perhaps knows now more than ever, following the disappointment from by the antics of its greatest individual performer last season, that Liverpool’s strength next term will come from the sum of its parts.
