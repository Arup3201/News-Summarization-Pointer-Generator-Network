Part Metal Gear Solid, part Devil May Cry, Revengeance attempts - and largely succeeds - at reinventing Raiden, a character that, until now, may have divided opinion.

Indeed, from the moment you're treated to the awe-inspiring, kinetically-charged combat, you know that you're in for something special.

A large part of this is due to an ingenious fighting mechanic called the Zandatsu. Here, you are propelled into a slow-motion mini-game where you have to target and sever specific points of an enemy. It's brilliantly responsive and makes a welcome change from overused quick-time events that plague games of similar ilk.

Epic: Some of the set-pieces in Revengeance are among the best in Metal Gear's illustrious history

General gameplay is blisteringly fast. Blocking and parrying (both of which use the same combination of a timed button press and directional input), are the bread and butter with a focus on Raiden being as offensively-minded as possible.

This, coupled with cleverly intertwined slow-motion and a repertoire of acrobatic aerial manoeuvres makes battles some of the most visually spectacular around.

It's a shame, though, that the camera can sometimes be inconsistent - making it hard to see exactly what's going on. However, the wonderful set-pieces offer no such irritation. 

Raiden's main weapon is an electric blade, but modifications to it later on in the game help to stop repetition setting in.

Enemies, armed with a variety of rocket launchers and heavy weapons, are ruthlessly aggressive and although it's relatively easy mowing them all down, the real challenge is pulling off the most stylish and brutal moves in Raiden's armoury, meaning that no battle is ever the same.

However, the 'S' level difficulty will prove tough enough to please even the most hardened Ninja Gaiden fans.

But it's not all action, and there's a lot here for Metal Gear fans to enjoy. In keeping with tradition of the games, there are special bosses - this time, four cyborgs called the Wings of Despair.

Although fleshing out their characters is primarily left to cutscenes 'Hideo Kojima style', boss battles have a very different feel which may jar with some hardcore fans of the universe.

Beating the odds: Throughout the action-packed campaign you will come up against a range of enemies, including robot war machines

Thankfully, the game is packed with trademark Metal Gear humour. The ability to perform a sneak attack after running around in the iconic cardboard box is a particular highlight.

Although some have criticised the game's length, it's still a solid nine to ten hour journey that never takes its foot off the gas. Graphically, the game holds up well with a solid framerate, but some textures are bland and muddy on close inspection.

But this doesn't take away from Revengeance being a brilliant action game - and one that's worthy of its Metal Gear title. That is perhaps the greatest accolade of them all.
