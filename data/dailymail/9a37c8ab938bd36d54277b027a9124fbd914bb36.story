Bobbi Kristina's aunt has said she believes Nick Gordon will '110 per cent' be charged with a crime related to the 21-year-old's injuries.

Leolah Brown, Bobby Brown's sister, said she thinks he had a part in the incident on January 31, when Bobbi Kristina was found face-down in a bathtub at the couple's Roswell, Georgia townhouse.

No one has been charged in the incident or named as a suspect, and Gordon has not responded to the family's accusations.

Bobbi Kristina, the 21-year-old daughter of Whitney Houston, has been on a ventilator in hospital since she was found, but Leolah Brown insisted she is 'doing good' and has even opened her eyes.

Speaking out: Speaking to Fox News, Leolah Brown, Bobbi Kristina's aunt, has said she believes the young woman's boyfriend, Nick Gordon, should be charged in relation to her injuries

'I saw this coming,' she told Fox 5 Atlanta. 'I told her not to trust anyone.'

Gordon was taken in by Houston as a child and brought up as Bobbi Kristina's brother - but after Houston's death, they started a romantic relationship and last year, they claimed they had married.

In the Fox interview, Leolah said she does not think Gordon has been a good influence on her niece.

'I have my reasons,' she said, without going into further detail. 'There are a lot of family reasons that have that same reason.'

She went on: 'I believe Nick Gordon will be charged with this... I hope that he will be charged with this as well. Soon. I really do.' 

She added that she had lived with Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown and had helped them look after Bobbi Kristina, but never saw Gordon around the house.

'Signs of improvement': She said that Bobbi Kristina, pictured with Gordon, has opened her eyes and appears to be improving. Gordon has not responded to the family's accusations about his part in the incident

She also reiterated her brother's statement that the young couple are not married, despite their claims on social media last year, and hinted that they had been through some trouble.

'This is the man Krissi loved but she was a young girl,' she said. 'We stay.' 

Leolah also dismissed the idea that Bobbi Kristina would have hurt herself. 

'Krissi would never do anything to herself,' she said. 'She loved life too much. She had too much going on. She had too much ahead of her.'

As for her niece's current condition, she rubbished reports that Bobbi Kristina was brain dead.

'It's been very, very painful for everybody. Mainly Bobby, because that's his baby,' she said of her brother, Bobby Brown.

But she added that they remain hopeful, especially because she has given them 'signs' that she'll recover, such as opening her eyes, she said.

There is also no truth to the idea that Bobbi Kristina would be removed from life support today - the same day her mother died three years ago - she said.

Support: On Wednesday, Bobbi Kristina's grandmother Cissy Houston (right) and aunt Pat Houston (center) were seen at Emory University Hospital, where the 21-year-old woman remains in a coma

By her side: Bobbi Kristina's father Bobby Brown (left) can be seen outside the hospital last week, while his wife Alicia Etheredge, who is four months pregnant, was pictured outside the hospital on Wednesday

'No,' she said, adding: 'Bobby's calling the shots.'

The family has been at Bobbi Kristina's bedside in Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, where she remains in a medically-induced coma after being found submerged in bathwater.

No one has been charged or named as a suspect in the January incident. Gordon has not commented publicly about his girlfriend's condition and has not responded to the family's accusations.

Earlier this week, RadarOnline reported that bruises were found on Bobbi Kristina's body. Gordon told a friend that he caused them while performing CPR.

It has also emerged that one of their neighbors reported a domestic dispute at her address the week before she was found, according to a 911 call made by her security guard on January 23.

The caller told a 911 dispatcher that one of the neighbors had reported a fight at the address. They said they saw people 'hitting each other and swinging' outside the three bedroom townhouse.

He did not give descriptions of how many people were fighting or who they were .

The ongoing investigation and limited details being provided in Miss Brown's case have fueled speculation about her condition and the circumstances that led to her hospitalization.

'We continue to request privacy in this matter,' Bobby Brown said in a statement released through his lawyer, Christopher Brown. 'We thank everyone that supported the vigil for Bobbi Kristina. God is hearing our prayers.'
