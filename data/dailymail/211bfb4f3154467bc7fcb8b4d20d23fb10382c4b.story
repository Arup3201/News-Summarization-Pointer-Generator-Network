A Bronx man is lucky to be alive after being run over Saturday morning by a subway train.

Ralph Mercado, 55, fell onto the northbound tracks just after 11.30am Saturday at Union Square just before an R train pulled into the station. He survived with barely a scratch even though the train rolled directly over him.

Mr Mercado was able to roll into the trench between the tracks, which gave him just enough space to evade being crushed by the train.

Lucky to be alive: Ralph Mercado, 55, fell onto the tracks at Union Square Station

‘I heard screaming,’ witness Suzannah Troy told the New York Post. ‘He was reaching out to the people reaching out to help him, but there wasn’t enough time to grab him.’

‘He went back to the middle. His head turned looking at the train. [Then] he’s right under the train! He’s right here!’

The train had slowed to almost a crawl by the time it reached Mr Mercado, but it was unable to stop before rolling over him.

‘He did like a push up and went down. It rolled right over him,’ she added. ‘The train was moving as slow as possible.’

A video shot by Ms Troy shows the train frozen on the tracks while an MTA employee jumps down between the train cars and searches for the man with a flashlight.

‘He’s in the trough!’ The MTA worker shouted into his radio before yelling ‘don’t move!’ at Mr Mercado before radioing to have the power cut to the track.

Another witness yelled ‘he’s alive’ as the MTA worker climbed up off the track and back on to the train platform.

Mr Mercado was soon pulled to safety with only a bruised hand, according to NBC New York.

He told officers he jumped down to help a woman who fell, according to the Post, but witnesses told the paper there was no one else on the tracks.

The lucky-to-be-alive man was taken to Bellevue Hospital for a psychological evaluation.

A total of 145 people have been struck by trains this year in New York. Of those, 52 have died.
