Prince Harry has been ordered to be on his best behaviour on his latest posting in the United States.

The party-loving prince has been moved to the tiny town of Gila Bend in the Arizona desert for the final stage of a two-month advanced weapons training course.

Ron Henry, mayor of the 1,700-strong community where many residents are devout Christians, says Harry should take care as his reputation as a ladies' man has gone before him.

'There are probably some fathers here
who would go to extremes to protect their daughters,' said Mr Henry, 
64.

Helicopter pilot Harry, 27, was sent 
to Gila Bend last week, as the conditions mimic those he could face in 
Afghanistan. He will live at a nearby base for the next month.

It is a contrast to the past four 
weeks he spent at the El Centro base in California where he could enjoy 
the nightlife of San Diego.

'Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and we have some very pretty girls here.

'It is a very quiet town with a lot of good Christian people. This isn't a party town.'

The sleepy town - a former stagecoach
stop - has just 1,700 residents, one bar - and a Â£60 a night hotel 
designed to look like a Space Ship.

It enjoys a minor notability among 
aficionados of roadside attractions for its quirky welcome sign which 
boasts the conurbation is 'home to 17000 friendly people and 5 old 
crabs'.

But party central it isn't.

The reason why, however, it is such 
an attraction for the British military is that its soaring daily 
temperatures - well over 110F - bitterly cold nights and arid conditions.

The prince will live at the local 
Gila Bend Air Force Auxiliary Field base for the next month while he 
hones his skills and on Friday night he was seen at a local pizza 
restaurant enjoying something to eat - and a couple of beers - with his 
fellow recruits.

Owner of the Little Italia, Antonino 
Buccellato, said he was one of 30 pilots who stopped off for a bit to 
eat, ordering a 'meat lovers' pizza and telling the manager 'that's the 
best pizza in the world'.

'The customers recognised him but they were polite and no-one stared,' he said.

Waitress Michelle Green, 37, added: 
'He was a gentleman. Gila Bend is a nice small town. But we don't even 
have a movie theatre to take a girl on a date.'

It was a relatively quiet night for 
Harry, who has lived up to his wild reputation while stationed for the 
past four weeks at the El-Centro base in California, a few hours drive 
away.

He has regularly been seen enjoying 
the nightlife of San Diego and is even said to have romanced 26-year-old
cocktail waitress Jess Donaldson, who boasts a large rose tattoo across
her midriff - and an even bigger boyfriend.

Although Miss Donaldson has 
vehemently denied a liaison, the pair were photographed apparently 
kissing at a gig in the Belly Up Tavern before heading back to Harry's 
suite at the nearby Marriott Courtyard hotel.

Fortunately - or not, as the case may be - Gila Bend offers less in the way of nightlife.

Brigette Mowry, 45, bartender at 
Netos, the town's only bar, said: 'Sometimes the British pilots come in 
here and play pool or have a beer.

'If we put on a karaoke night that'll be the only chance of meeting any local girls.'

Mayor Henry added: 'It is a pretty quiet nightlife scene here in Gila Bend.

'I would advise the Prince to take in the beautiful sights of the desert instead.'

While Space Age Lodge waitress Renee 
Vidana, 38, warned that 'here are a lot of girls in town who would kill 
to meet a British prince, I think he is going to be swamped when he 
comes here', others are less impressed.

Cowboy Terrell Farnsworth, 49, interviewed on his horse, said: 'I have no idea who Prince Henry [sic] is.

Gila Bend was chosen by the MoD for 
Apache helicopter training because the desert region resembles the 
mountain terrain of Afghanistan
