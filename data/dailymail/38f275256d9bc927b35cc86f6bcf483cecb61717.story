An adviser to the Polish president accused U.S. authorities on Monday of 'absolute ignorance' in seeking the arrest of film director Roman Polanski, a Holocaust survivor, while he was in Poland last week for the opening of a Jewish history museum.

The comments underline the dilemma of Poland in the face of continued attempts by the U.S. to seek Polanski's arrest on 1977 charges of having sex with a minor.

Poland is a close US ally. But the Polish political class has shown a strong aversion to arresting and extraditing the Oscar-winning Polish-French filmmaker, who made his first films in Poland and is admired as a representative of Polish culture.

Roman Polanski, 81, traveled to the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw and US authorities asked the Polish to arrest him

'I think that Polish citizens, especially in cases of crimes whose statute of limitations have run out, should not be subject to extradition,' Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz said when asked about the Polanski case.

There is no statute of limitations on Polanski's case because he has already pleaded guilty to the charges. 

Polanski, 81, who lives in France, attended the opening of the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw on October 28 before traveling to Krakow, his childhood city. Polish authorities questioned him there because of the US request, but refused to arrest him.

Tomasz Nalecz, adviser to President Bronislaw Komorowski, said he felt it was inappropriate to seek the arrest of a 'child of the Holocaust' in Poland during the opening of the museum, which highlights Poland's role as a safe haven for Jews for centuries before the Holocaust.

'From the point of view of Polish history,' the US official who requested the arrest 'showed absolute ignorance,' Nalecz said.

The U.S. Embassy didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Polanski, who has Jewish origins, lost his mother at Auschwitz. He survived the war assuming a non-Jewish identity.

Polish media say Polanski has been seeking guarantees that Poland won't extradite him as he plans to direct a new film in Poland next year on the Dreyfus affair, the early 20th century French spy scandal.

US officials have been trying to convince European nations to arrest Polanski and extradite him to America ever since he fled the country in 1978.

Samantha Gailey was just 13 years old when Polanski raped her after luring her behind closed doors for a photo shoot. 

Polanski pleaded guilty to having sex with the child, but escaped to Europe before he was sentenced. He has spent the last three and a half decades evading US authorities.

He lives in France, which refuses to arrest the director. He has been previously arrested in Switzerland, though police there refused to send him back to America and later released him.
