Binky has had a rough old ride over the last few months, what with the discovery of ex-boyfriend Alex Mytton's infidelity and some seriously rocky friendships.

However, determined not to let this get her down, the 23-year-old Made in Chelsea star has reinvented herself with a strict diet and excercise plan that has seen her drop a stone and go down one dress size, from an 10 to an 8.

Binky admits that she struggled for 
years with a lack of body confidence, especially in the early days of Made 
In Chelsea when she was appearing alongside super-slim co-stars such as Millie
 Mackintosh.

Noticeable difference: Binky said she had felt puffy and greasy before she lost the weight (right) but now feels like a new person (left)

'Looking back at the old shows, I think I looked awful and overweight' says the Made in Chelsea star.

She said that she had even received jibes from her ex-boyfriend and she was determined to change.

'My
 face was really puffy and my hair was greasy. I think I had lost touch 
with my appearance a bit. My ex-boyfriend used to call me the big 
whale.'

Spurred on by an up-coming calender shoot, Binky gave herself the target weight 9st 2lbs to reach in six weeks.

All sounding a little unattainable? Binky says it's within the grasp of anyone who has decided to get in shape.

Like many of us, she's never been particularly keen on hitting the gym, so she created her very own at-home workout routine. 

Binky says she would never have felt confident enough to pose for her shoot had she not lost weight

'I knew I
 had to get on a serious fitness kick. That said, I've never been much 
of a gym bunny so I decided to turn my front room into my very own 
work-out space.

'Every
 other morning I would move the dining table to one side and have my 
very own gym space. The work-outs were really energetic cardio programs 
and, if I'm  honest, my fitness levels were pretty poor and at first I 
could only manage 45 minutes, but over time I was doing a full hour.'

Binky hit her goal weight within six weeks and was so pleased with the result she was happy to pose for a revealing set of pictures for her 2015 Signature Calender shoot, wearing a skin-tight leopardprint catsuit.

Binky said that she would never had felt confident enough to have posed like that had she not reached her goal weight.

'I've never felt better and it was great to see my super-flat tummy in the after shoots. I also felt super-sensual in those gorgeous designer outfits for the calendar shoot.

'It's all due to my new health regime. For the first time in my life, I feel really confident about showing off my body.'

So what's her secret? Binky says that along with severe determination (and perspiration), using Forza Raspberry K2 diet supplements also helped to speed the process along, especially when she was busy filming.

'I'd usually do my work outs at about 8am before I went to filming for Made In Chelsea and I would take one or two tablets of Forza Raspberry K2.

'They would give me an energy boost to build up the inclination to start the work-out session as well as helping with fat-burning.

'There is no way I could have done this 
shoot if I hadn't done the work-outs and been using the Forza Raspberry 
K2. I just wouldn't have felt confident enough to be pictured in this 
way.'

Forza Supplements managing director Lee 
Smith was quick to compliment the star on her new shape.

'Binky looks really slinky - we are thrilled out how quickly
 she has got in shape' he says.

Binky herself says: 'Over the first few days, the results were amazing. I lost just over four pounds in four days.

'By the 
third week I had lost about eight pounds and I could really start to see
 a difference, which really gave me more enthusiasm to press on to my 
target weight of just over nine stone.

'By then I was losing about two pounds a week and I could really start to see myself getting more and more toned.

'I
 hit my target weight of 9st 2lbs a week before the 
calendar shoot. It really gave me confidence knowing that I'd worked 
hard and was in the best shape possible.'

In typical down-to-earth Binky style, she admits that it wasn't a walk in the park and she did have days when she didn't stick to the diet.

'I did have a few days when I fell off the wagon. Drinking wine is my worst failing when it comes to losing weight and also I do love my food, especially take-away curries. Chicken Jalfrezi with sag aloo is my favourite, but I cut this treat down to every other week.

'I stopped the late-night kebab pitstops too. I also cut down on my drinking and would only have Skinny Bitches - vodka, fresh lime and soda.'
