Justine Greening was last night urged to quit the Cabinet over her role in the West Coast Main Line fiasco.

Aides to the International Development Secretary insisted she had ‘acted properly at all times’ in her handling of the franchise bid during her time as Transport Secretary.

But Graham Stringer, a Labour member of the Commons transport committee, said her refusal to follow up concerns about the bidding process should cost her her job.

Mr Stringer said: ‘Officials have clearly made mistakes, but the prime responsibility lies with ministers.

‘When the scale of the concerns about this process became clear Justine Greening should have called a halt to the process and called in the lawyers and accountants to go through it with a fine toothed comb.

‘I don’t think she can escape her responsibility just because she has moved department. She has cost the British taxpayer at least £40million and damaged the Government’s credibility on infrastructure. That should finish her career in Government.’

A senior Government source last night insisted that David Cameron retained full confidence in both Miss Greening and the Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers, who actually signed off the controversial rail deal in her previous role as Rail Minister.

The source added: ‘This is an incredibly complex process and it is totally unrealistic to expect ministers to have drilled down into the computer models – at a certain level you have to have faith in the civil servants.’

But yesterday’s events are a humiliating career setback for Miss Greening, a favourite of the Prime Minister who has been fast-tracked into the Cabinet.

Miss Greening has long been seen as one of the Government’s rising stars.

She was given the Transport portfolio last year in the mini-reshuffle that followed the abrupt departure of former defence secretary Liam Fox.

At the time, supporters stressed her background as an accountant – although her skills appear to have done her little good in dealing with the rail franchising disaster.

Chancellor George Osborne is said to have pressed for her removal because of her outspoken opposition to expansion at Heathrow airport, which would directly affect her constituency in Putney, south west London.

But, as one of the Cabinet’s few women, she was offered another plum post at the Department for International Development.

She is said to have been reluctant to 
move, partly because of personal doubts about the Government’s 
controversial pledge to pour billions more into foreign aid at a time of
austerity at home.

Since her appointment, however, she has cheered Tory backbenchers by ordering a review of the millions of pounds of aid money squandered on consultants.

Miss Greening was publicly dismissive of concerns about the rail franchise process and was only hours away from signing a binding deal with FirstGroup when Virgin mounted legal action.

Aides last night said she had repeatedly sought and received assurances from senior officials that the franchise process had been conducted properly.

Sources also pointed out that the franchise process had been started by her predecessor Philip Hammond, who is now Defence Secretary.

Sir Richard Branson claimed the Department for Transport had ‘certainly made the same mistake’ with other bids and criticised Miss Greening.

He told Channel 4 News: ‘The previous minister of transport should have just knocked the bid into touch some months ago but chose not to.

‘I don’t know what went on inside the Department for Transport and whether the previous minister knew all the facts or not, but certainly we appreciate the fact they acknowledged that there were major faults in the system and they have stayed in the system.’

Asked if Miss Greening was ‘incompetent’, he replied: ‘I’d rather not comment on previous ministers. I think it is rather unlikely that Justine Greening will ever come back to the department as a minister.’

Rail Minister Simon Burns denied the Government had known about the flaws in the bid. ‘It has been quite clear from the work that has been done in the department that ministers were not aware of the full extent of the problems that have just emerged.

‘They sought assurances, they sought advice, they were given assurances that procedures were robust and everything was being done correctly.’
