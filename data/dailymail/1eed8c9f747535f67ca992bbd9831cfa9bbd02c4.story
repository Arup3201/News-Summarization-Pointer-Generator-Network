A woman was killed in front of her husband after she was hit by a truck and dragged for three miles.

Kanchanben Patel, 58, was killed just days after she celebrated becoming a US citizen after the vehicle hit her near Foxborough, Massachusetts. Moses Acloque pleaded not guilty to several charges in connection with her death.

Her husband, Dahyabhai Patel, was able to free himself from the vehicle and suffered minor injuries.

Norfolk County District Attorney's Office said Acloque, 22, a football player and son of a Boston Police detective, allegedly ran into her and her husband in Wrentham at 10 pm.

Workers at an Arbor Inn Motel, where Mrs Patel worked as a manager, in Wrentham, told police that Acloque and another man had sped away from their property after refusing to pay their bill when the pick-up truck smashed into another vehicle before hitting Mrs Patel and her husband.

He drove about three miles before a state trooper saw Acloque and a second car behind his Ford F150 driving erratically, the Herald Sun reports.

The driver behind Acloque told the state trooper that he was driving erratically to attract attention because the white pick-up had just struck two people and was dragging one under his truck.

Acloque got out of his vehicle and 'began yelling for help and that someone was chasing him,' Trooper Sean O'Brien wrote.

'As I approached ... it appeared that he had a deer carcass wedged under his motor vehicle.'

Mr O'Brien said he discovered 'a long object in the parking lot. As I drew closer, I could determine that it was a human body.'

Acloque pleaded not guilty to charges that include driving while license to operate suspended, leaving the scene of an accident causing death, motor vehicle homicide by negligent operation, leaving the scene of a personal injury crash, and leaving the scene of property damage.

He said he had 'no idea' he had hit someone.

Friends and family of Patel are comforting her husband.

'She was the kindest lady here that you could ever find. (Her husband) was right beside her,' said one friend, 'She was a really nice person, and it is sad to see someone like her go. For this to happen to the nicest little lady in the world, it is shameful.'

Another friend, Stanley, said she had only just become a US citizen.

'She was so proud, and we gave her a little cake and everything,' he said. 'They were very proud of being American citizens.'

Truck: At his arraignment, it was alleged Acloque had been skipping out on a bill when he hit Mr and Mrs Patel
