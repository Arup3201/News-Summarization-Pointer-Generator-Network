If West Ham really are serious top-four contenders, Sunday’s game against Arsenal will determine just how far they can go.

The Hammers spent Christmas Day in dreamland; fourth in the Premier League for the first time ever and their highest league position during the festive period since 1985, when they memorably went on to finish third with Messrs McAvennie, Cottee and Co.

But on Boxing Day they crash landed and dropped to fifth in the table behind Southampton after champions-elect Chelsea cruised to a comfortable victory.

James Tomkins was missing at Stamford Bridge with a slight hamstring problem. But the 25-year-old is battling to be fit for the London derby at Upton Park, for what will be his 200th appearance for the club he has proudly played for since the age of eight.

Win against Arsenal and local Basildon boy Tomkins insists the result will go a long way to underlining West Ham’s European credentials. Yet if they lose, there’s a danger they could fall by the wayside.

‘The league doesn’t really lie and I think the performances that we’ve put on against the top teams have been exceptional like against Manchester City and Liverpool,’ he says.

‘But this Christmas period is important and you’re going to see some teams fall by the wayside.

‘That just goes to show how important the squad is, especially at this time of year because you will pick up injuries and suspensions.

‘I’ve been here since I was eight-years-old and, in a way, it’s like a dream because West Ham are not really meant to be up there - or so some people say. But we’ve got a very good team and we expect a lot from ourselves. We deserve to be there though. Then again, I don’t think we expected to be where are to be honest with you.

‘The position of where we are in the league has been great. It’s probably been the best in the league since I started playing here but also the performances. They’ve been some of the best we’ve played as a team and as individuals.

‘If we keep heading in the way that we are at the moment then obviously we need to have that ambition to push for Europe.’

European football is not the only ambition for Tomkins. He’s desperate the play for England, completing an international journey that has seen him represent his country at every age level - and for Team GB at the London 2012 Olympics - bar the senior squad.

His form this season has been outstanding. He scored his first goal in over two years against West Brom earlier this month and Three Lions boss Roy Hodgson must now be an admirer.

But Tomkins knows he must continue to help West Ham perform above expectations in the league if he is to stand any chance.

Sunday’s potential duel with Arsenal striker Alexis Sanchez represents the perfect opportunity for him. And as an aficionado of the beautiful game - he’s an avid viewer of La Liga and all things football - Tomkins is under no illusions about the task ahead.

‘It would be nice to one day get that call-up but one thing’s for sure, you need to keep playing well for your club,’ he says.

‘I’ve seen Arsenal play quite a lot this season and I like to watch Spanish football so, I’ve seen Sanchez play for Barcelona and know what he’s about. He’s a proven player but has come and shown that in this league, which isn’t always easy to do.

‘But you can’t just focus on one man’s attributes because Arsenal have quality all over the team. We’re fully aware of how they are and it’s a matter of not worrying too much about them and focus on ourselves. You have to focus our your performances on the pitch and that’s what we have done so far this season and the results have been unbelievable.

‘I’m 25 now but I feel I am still learning, experience-wise. I feel that the more games I’ve played, the better I’m getting. I’ve been having a good run in the team at the moment and it’s been nice to get some momentum going into each game.’

Fifth or fourth in the league, it still remains a major fillip for manager Sam Allardyce who this time last year faced strong calls from supporters to be sacked.

And in light of the criticism Sunday’s opposing manager Arsene Wenger has endured this season, Tomkins is quick to identify West Ham’s incredible rise up the table as proof to why clubs must stand by their manager - although he is still keen to crank up the pressure.

‘Arsenal have conceded goals more than should be doing for a team of that calibre and that’s where we can hurt them because we’ve got goals in abundance.

‘But sometimes you can see managers come and go too quickly.

‘There’s been cases where there are two or three managers at some clubs in a year and that’s far too many. They need time to settle in.

‘Arsenal fans, just like any other fans, expect a lot from their team and expect trophies and to win games. Wenger’s done a great job there and I don’t think that will ever be forgotten. So it’s nice to see a team put their faith into their manager. He’s been the longest-serving manager in the Premier League.

‘When a manager’s doing all that he can and it’s up to the players on the pitch to show what they can do.

‘With the bigger clubs that can be difficult because the expectations are higher. With ourselves, it’s nice that the owners showed their faith in the Gaffer, because look at what he’s done and what we’ve achieved so far this season.’

It’s not over yet and Tomkins knows it. But if it has anything to do with him, West Ham will be marching on a European tour next year.
