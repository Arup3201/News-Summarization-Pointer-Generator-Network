Sir Cliff Richard is to sell his £3million home raided by police over child abuse claims, telling friends he feels like he has been 'ransacked by burglars'.

The distraught star has confided in those close to him that he feels 'violated' by the police search of his Berkshire penthouse and can't bear to return to his only British home.

The 73-year-old is said to have been sickened when he learnt detectives were rifling through his belongings as live images of the raid were broadcast around the world by the BBC.

Sir Cliff Richard said he plans to sell his luxury £3million penthouse in Sunningdale, Berkshire 

'Violated': Detectives were filmed from a helicopter walking into the singer's £3million Berkshire home

He was on holiday in Portugal when South Yorkshire Police swooped without warning on August 14. 

They had received a report of a sex attack on a teenage boy at a Christian rally in Sheffield almost three decades ago.

Now the pop star, who has denied the allegations, is determined to sell his Sunningdale apartment at the earliest opportunity. 

'He is putting the place on the market because he feels it has been violated by the search,' said the friend. 'He says he feels it's akin to having your home ransacked by burglars.

'He is a totally innocent man, yet several officers went into his home without any warning, in view of the news cameras, and rifled through his effects.'

The decision to sell will not have been taken lightly, as Sir Cliff spent years searching for his ideal property in the Home Counties – eventually buying the £3.1million penthouse in 2008.

The Art Deco building has Portland stone columns and bronze-framed windows, and is conveniently near the Surrey office of the Cliff Richard Organisation, which handles his affairs.

It is not yet on the market because of the police inquiry, but Sir Cliff is said to be anxious to move it on as soon as possible. The sale is likely to be overseen by John McElynn, 60, the former Roman Catholic priest who has been Sir Cliff's closest companion for the past 15 years and manages all his homes, including a Manhattan apartment and his villa in Barbados.

The singer has chosen to remain at his holiday home in the Algarve after being voluntarily questioned by South Yorkshire Police last month.

A close friend said the star, who has angrily dismissed the allegations dating back to 1985 as 'completely false', now feels 'trapped' as he waits to hear the outcome of the inquiry.

Although he has not been arrested and faces no restrictions on his travel, Sir Cliff has preferred to cancel public engagements since the news broke. His friend said: 'It's purely a personal thing. Cliff is one of those people who always stops and chats to everyone when they come up to him, and he just doesn't feel he would be able to do that as things stand.'

Police and the BBC have been heavily criticised over the way the raid unfolded. David Crompton, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, said the force had been put in a 'difficult position' by the BBC – however Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, accused police of 'sheer incompetence'.
