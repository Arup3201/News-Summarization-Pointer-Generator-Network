Hearts are celebrating the Scottish Championship title after Hibernian's defeat to Rangers confirmed the Gorgie club's return to the top flight.

A 3-0 victory at Falkirk on Saturday stretched Hearts' lead over second-placed Hibs to 23 points and their city rivals could not stop their crowning as champions for another week as they suffered a 2-0 loss to Rangers.

Former Hearts left-back Lee Wallace put Rangers on the way to a victory in Leith that had major ramifications across the Scottish capital.

Hearts head coach Robbie Neilson, who was attending a coaching course on Sunday, had wanted his team to finish off the job at home to Queen of the South next Saturday but the maroon half of the city were no doubt celebrating a Hibs defeat with even more fervour than usual.

Hearts have won 25 of their 29 league games so far and have only lost once - at home to Falkirk in January.

Speaking immediately after their latest game against Falkirk, Neilson said: 'Tomorrow morning, I'll be at Stirling University getting my Pro Licence, with a business management course starting at 9am, so it'll be very exciting I'm sure.

'I'll be checking my phone regularly, I'm sure. I'll be there with some other managers, Paul Hartley will be there so it'll be good to catch up with him.

'If we win the league tomorrow, great. If it's the following week at home to Queen of the South, then even better. I'd rather go into the Queens game needing a result if I'm honest.

'We'd like to deliver a performance worthy of the supporters and clinch the league ourselves.'
