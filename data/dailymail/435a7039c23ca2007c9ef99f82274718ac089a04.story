A children's ministry in Alabama is under fire after it bizarrely chose to feature a quote from Adolf Hitler on a billboard.

The giant billboard at the Village Mall in Auburn features five smiling children beneath a quote from Hitler that reads: 'He alone, who owns the youth, gains the future.' The quote is even attributed to Hitler on the sign.

Lamar Advertising officials said the billboard was rented by Opelika, Alabama-based Life Savers Ministries.

Life Savers Ministries founder James Anderegg said the organization is taking down the billboard after the strange choice of quote sparked a backlash in the community.

Hitler's quote traces back to his controversial speeches of the 1930s, and has historically been linked to the Nazi youth programs.

Mr Anderegg admitted to The Columbus Ledger-Enquirer that former U.S. President Herbert Hoover's quote about children being society's most valuable resource would have been a better choice.

Mr Anderegg said the group had honorable intentions and never intended to cause confusion.

The newspaper first reported on the questionable billboard, that was erected Friday, after a reader took a photo of it and sent it in to the newspaper.

It will be taken down Tuesday.

'We are pulling the billboard,' Mr Anderegg said.

'We are a children's organization and had honorable intentions and nothing less.'

LSM was founded in 1996.

According to the organization's website, it now has 'six school buses and a magnificent facility of its own where hundreds of boys and girls are brought from around 20 different rough and tough locations throughout Opelika and Auburn.'
