Two Aussie housewives who began writing  Mills & Boon novels after dropping off their kids at school have turned their love of raunchy romance books into successful and lucrative careers.

Despite always being fans of the most popular genre of fiction in the world, Melanie Milburne and Ally Blake fell into their sexy writing style and have now penned almost 100 romantic pieces between them.

Hopeless romantics at heart, the women love their fun jobs and say their husbands try to cheekily take credit as their ongoing inspiration for the kinky bedroom chapters.

Hopeless romantics - Ally and Mark got married in Las Vegas in 2000 and honeymooned throughout the U.S.

Mark claims that he is Ally's ongoing inspiration for her risque Mills & Boon novels

Melanie, who lives in Hobart, has always wanted to be a writer but with a husband doing crazy hours as a surgeon she needed to hold down the fort at home and care for their two sons.

It wasn't until her boys were in their teens that she found the time to give writing a go and has now written 64 Mills & Boon books in the past 12 years.

'I couldn't stop writing and the rest is history,' she said.

'I had all of these ideas backed up inside my head because I had wanted to write my whole life.'

Her sons were 'quietly embarrassed' about their mother's new raunchy writing career but now adults themselves - they have an appreciation Melanie's books.

'My husband is also very proud of my career and is always offering himself up for "research", she said.

'Actually, he's fantastic at helping me when I write the occasional medical romance as he is a general/ trauma surgeon.'

Ally's husband likes to claim the credit as being the  inspiration for his wife's books. 

'He tries to help me write my books - I let him name the dogs and that's about it,' she laughed. 

'His idea is to add an alien ship which is not terribly helpful in the genre.' 

Ally also sold the first book that she submitted to Mills & Boon 12 years - and 30 books - ago.

The 40-year-old now drops off her two girls, 7 and 5, and her son, 4, to school before getting stuck into her script.

'I was hoping to get a nice rejection letter where the editor gives me helpful feedback so it was wild when it sold - it still feels magical,' she said.

Melanie knew she was going to marry her husband of 32 years after their second date and Steve proposed six weeks later

The Queenslander makes sure she keeps away from the obvious distractions of home and heads to a local cafe or library to set up office for the day before collecting the kids after school. 

'If I'm at home the fridge calls to me too much so I go to work I get dressed, put on lipstick and "go to work",' she said.

'I could work at a Bon Jovi concert, I can work with that much cafe noise around me - I'm very lucky that my job is portable and flexible.' 

Ally says she is not a 'plotter' and describes the novels that don't come naturally to her as 'giving birth to a pineapple.'

'I take a deep breath and say "ready, set, go" so when the readers are surprised about how a book turns out sometimes I'm surprised as well,' she says.

However, Melanie says she never has a shortage of ideas for risque story lines.

'I read trashy mags and listen to the news - it  can be a combination of ideas that I just start playing with,' she explains.

'I always go through the bedroom doors but it's not erotic or illicit.'

As with all great romance novels - every story always has a happy ending. 

'People think it's all bout sex but that's not a huge part - it's all about the growth of the characters,' she said.  

A hopeless romantic, Melanie knew she was going to marry her husband of 32 years after their second date and he proposed six weeks later.

'We were looking at a painting at the Opera House and I just had this feeling - I can't explain it.'

Ally, who confesses to having a different crush everyday  at school, married Mark in Las Vegas in 2000

While Ally, who confesses to having a different crush everyday of the week when she was at school,  married Mark in Las Vegas in 2000.

'I always relished that tummy flutter sensation,' she admits.

Melanie, who has Billionaire's Ultimate Acquisition coming out in April, says she is never short of story ideas and has not changed her writing style over the years.

'As to readers expectations due to 50 Shades, I haven't changed the level of sensuality,' she said.

'I've always written on the passionate side - it's not erotica, however.'

While Ally, who has a new book Billionaire on her Doorstep set to be released in March, describes her style as 'fun, fresh and flirty'.

Despite Mills & Boon books being perceived by some as corny and cliche, the women usually only experience positive reactions when they reveal their occupation.

'It's such a unique and unusual kind of job that if you are at a party and people find out you're a romance author suddenly their eyes light up and they have a million questions, so it's quite a cool conversation starter,' Ally said.

Mills & Boon has been in Australia for 41 years and in that time:
