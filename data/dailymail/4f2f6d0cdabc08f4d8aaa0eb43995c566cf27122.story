Mothers in Russia took part in a humiliating competition where they made their babies crawl in races in a bid to win laptop computers.

The mums in Krasnoyarsk Krai, a city in central Russia, were among thousands who offered up their children in the races which are increasingly taking place across the country.

Some 400 mums gathered with their babies -some who looked distraught - to make them crawl along blue plastic race strips for all they were worth in a bid to win the coveted computers.

Race: A mother can be seen encouraging her little boy to crawl faster so that she can bag the top prize during the race in Russia

Bribes: Pushy parents promised their youngsters sweets, treats and even  pets by showing pics of dogs, cats and fish to get them to the finish line

One excited parent, Ludmilla Koskakova said: 'I have wanted a laptop for ages and
 I hoped that my girl Olga, ten months, will win the crawl.'

Other pushy parents promised their youngsters 
sweets, treats and even pets by showing pics of dogs, cats 
and fish to get them to the finish line.

However, local parenting groups 
objected to the unusual spectacle.

Alexei Sogovitch said: 'Children, like 
animals, are not put on earth for our amusement. If they want to compete
 in crawling races, it should be done when they are adult and can make 
those decisions.'

Quick step: This baby tries her best to crawl quickly, but critics suggest that the competition was completely wrong and should not have taken place at all

Encouraging: This little boy is given a helping hand forward by his parent - many mums said that they were keen to win the laptop
