The body of a woman has been discovered at a New South Wales beach by a couple of surfers.

Believed to be aged in her 30s, the woman was found partially clothed, wearing only shoes and pants, by the water's edge at Nobbys Beach near Newcastle, the ABC reports.

Police were called to the scene at about 6am on Wednesday and are treating the death as suspicious.

'There's no obvious signs of injuries to the female so the cause of death is unknown at this point in time,' Inspector Michael Gorman told the ABC.

'We will be relying on the results of the post mortem examination.'

'We're looking at all avenues - from foul play, through to self harm, through to accident, so nothing has been ruled out at this time.' 

Detectives and forensic specialist officers are currently still at the scene.

Nearby cruise ships have confirmed that none of their passengers are missing.

The woman has not been identified and police are appealing for anyone with information to make contact.
