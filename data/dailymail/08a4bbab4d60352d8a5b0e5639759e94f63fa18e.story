They have been seen grabbing dinner together in LA's San Fernando Valley for the better part of a year.

But during a radio interview with The Breakfast Club on Tuesday rapper Tyga, 25, insisted he is not dating Keeping Up With The Kardashians star Kylie Jenner, 17.

'No, I'm not dating Kylie. I wanna be clear to everybody, I didn't leave my family to be with Kylie. That's ridiculous,' the Compton born singer said.

Kylie Jenner has definitely got a style of her own but every now and again she likes to take inspiration from her older sisters in the sartorial stakes.

And this look is pure Kim. The ripped J Brand jeans, cropped top, heels and the long coat; she's a medium sized mini me! But while Kim's coat is more often than not by Céline, Kylie has kept things strictly high street with a coat from ASOS.

We love this long duster style. It's elegant and sophisticated but is a lightweight option for when the days aren't quite so cold. Perfect for winter in LA. Style it over skinnies and a pair of skater shoes for casual chic or layer over your little black dress for the office Christmas party.

And we've included Kylie's cropped jeans too so you can really complete the look.

The Make It Nasty singer added, 'Me and [ex Blac] Chyna, we broke up almost close to a year [ago] now, because of the decision we made, and things in our relationship that were not going right, [we] decided to split to raise an emotionally stable kid.'

Tyga then said, 'It’s because [of] what people make it seem… and TMZ, you gotta think, TMZ didn’t really care about me until they figured out that I live next door to Kim [Kardashian] and Kanye [West] and all that stuff.

'But I’ve been friends with them before I even met [Blac] Chyna. I was friends with Scott [Disick], her family for years, so me hanging out with them was nothing new.

'People just want to make a story out of it,'

The Don't Hate Tha Playa singer commented that Kylie is a 'beautiful young woman' whose 'maturity and mentality is different than a lot of people.'

He did not comment on why it took him so long to clear up the rumours they were a romantic item which have been lingering since the summer of 2014.

According to TMZ, the Bubble B*** hit maker is reacting to comments made by Kanye West's ex-girlfriend Amber Rose on the same program.

Rose - who took pot shots at Kylie's sister Khloe Kardashian on Monday claiming the E! star's father is OJ Simpson (and also calling Kim a wh***) - stated that Tyga and Kylie were a couple.

Their last night on the town together: That is the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star in the front seat of Tyga's car leaving the House Of Blues in West Hollywood on February 7

'[Kylie's] a baby, she needs to go to bed at 7 o'clock and relax,' Amber said when asked about Tyga's rumoured girl.

She added: 'That's ridiculous. [Tyga] should be ashamed of himself. That's how I feel. For sure.

'He has a beautiful woman and a baby and left that for a 16-year-old who just turned 17.'

Kylie turns 18-years-old in August.

Also on The Breakfast Club Tyga addressed a claim that someone called child services on him because Kylie is so young.

Tyga claimed law enforcement has not reached out to him about the possibility he has committed 'statutory rape.'

And the Hookah singer said though he spends time with Kylie, they are usually with her 19-year-old older sister Kendall, who has been modeling for Vogue and is the new face of Estee Lauder.

He was last seen with the daughter of Kris and Bruce Jenner on February 7 leaving Big Sean's concert at the House Of Blues in West Hollywood. 

She sat in the front seat of his Rolls Royce while a female pal sat in the back seat.

On Saturday - Valentine's Day - the E! teen shared a bouquet of pink roses which are presumed to be from the musician. 

The Breakfast Club is a radio show on Power 105.1 with DJ Ency, Angela Yee and Charlamagne Tha God.

Kylie is not good girlfriend material for Tyga not just because she is under the age of 18, but also because he was engaged to Chyna - the mother of his child - until fairly recently.

His former fiance and son: Kylie is not good girlfriend material for Tyga not just because she is under the age of 18, but also because he was engaged to Chyna - the mother of his child - until August 2014; here he is seen with his family in March

In October 2012 they welcomed a son, King Cairo. The family set up house in a $6.5m mansion in Calabasas, which is not far from where Kylie grew up in Hidden Hills.

In December 2012, Chyna - who is good friends with Kim Kardashian - confirmed they were engaged.

The split in August 2014, about the same time he started spending time with Kylie. 

Also on The Breakfast Club, the Switch Lanes singer  talked about his 'feud' with Drake.

Her sisters: Tyga also stated that most of the time he is with Kylie, her sibling Kendall (far left) is also there; here the girls are pictured with Khloe, 30, at the Grammy after party thrown by GQ on February 8
