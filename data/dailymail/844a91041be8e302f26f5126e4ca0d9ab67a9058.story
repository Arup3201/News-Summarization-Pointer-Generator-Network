A 21-year-old 'heroin addict' has today been accused of conning friends and strangers into donating to her 'life-saving cancer treatment' when really she was completely healthy and using the cash 'to fund her drug habit'.

Prosecutors claim Brittany Ozarowski of Selden, New York, carried out the elaborate scam for over a year claiming she had ovarian, stomach, brain and bone cancer, accepting numerous donations totaling more than $20,000.

The former Newfield High School Student set up a donation website explaining how she was dying and needed help; a Facebook fundraising page and placed jars near the cash registers of businesses across Nassau and Suffolk County.

Sympathetic friends and strangers hosted fundraising events and appealed for others to come forward and support her.

But in a press conference this afternoon, Suffolk District Attorney Thomas Spota said they had all been duped.

'It was a scam. There was no cancer, no chemo, and no radiation. The only thing that there was, was heroin and more heroin,' he said.

On her own website, Ozarowski, claims her family have already liquidated all their assets to pay for her treatment.

'In September of 2011 I was diagnosed with stage two ovarian cancer as well as stomach cancer,' she writes. 'After multiple treatments of both radiation and chemotherapy I had beaten cancer as of December 2011.'

'Scam': The 21-year-old had a fundraising page online, left, where she claimed she had stomach, brain, bone and ovarian cancer. According to police, she used pictures taken after a car accident on the site, right

'I was cancer free until they had found a tumor on my left hip in February 2012. That is when I found out that I have bone cancer. '

'The cancer has spread to my spine as well as my brain. So once again I was in need of radiation treatments as well as chemotherapy treatments.'

'This time the medicine was much more expensive and my family had already liquidated all assets since September.  The treatments are about $33,000 each day and although my doctor has been incredible with helping my family financially I am still short. I have very few options left and I am still in desperate need of treatments.'

She now faces 24 charges, including forgery and petit larceny.

Her arraignment has been postponed, but she is currently being held on $5,000 bail.

Officers say she had a car accident over a year ago which left her with multiple broken bones. She was arrested for being under the influence of heroin and used the photographs of her sitting in a wheelchair and getting treatment to perpetuate her fake cancer story, officers claim.

CBS News reports several locals who were allegedly caught out in the scam.

Denise Bambola who lives next door to the house where Ozarowski grew up with her grandmother said she donated $10,000.

'She looked sick. She looked like she was going to die,' she told the broadcaster. 'She completely fooled me. She completely fooled everybody.'

Tuscany Gourmet Market's owner, Thomas O’Grady, says the shop held a dinner dance and raised over $7,000 for Ozarowski while also giving $5,000 of his own.

'I lost $5,000 of my own, $7,265 we raised at the fundraiser and then
you have all the customers who have been donating for seven months 
into a jar,' he told CBS.

Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota told Long Island Press: 'There was no cancer, no chemotherapy, no radiation and no medical bills. There was just heroin.

'The truth is she is a 21 year old drug addict with four open narcotics 
cases, and we have strong evidence she forged doctors’ notes to avoid 
court appearances.'
