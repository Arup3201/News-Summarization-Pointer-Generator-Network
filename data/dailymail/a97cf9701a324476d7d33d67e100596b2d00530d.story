A woman has had an aggressive cancerous tumour removed after the dog she rescued from a life of misery sniffed out an aggressive tumour in the nick of time.

Josie Conlan, 46, had no idea she had a cancerous lump in her breast until her two-year-old border collie Ted began to repeatedly cry, paw and nuzzle at her chest - and she now credits him with saving her life.

The mother-of-four from Stockton-on-Tees wondered what was wrong, and when she put her hand to her chest she realised she had a lump.

Josie says her rescue dog Ted alerting her to the tumour, which was fast growing, likely saved her life 

Josie's prognosis is now good after having surgery as well as chemotherapy and radiotherapy

She visited her GP and was diagnosed with cancer but has now had the tumour, which she was told was advanced at grade three, removed.

She has also been given the welcome news that the disease has not spread to her lymph nodes.

In the two weeks before she was operated on the lump had grown by an incredible five millimetres and Josie believes that if it wasn't for Ted she could have been dead by summer.

She said: 'When I got the results from the hospital and was told the cancer had not spread the relief I felt was incredible and it is all down to Ted.

'It was also at this point that I was told that the tumour I had was particularly aggressive and had been growing very quickly. If I'd left it any later before going to the doctor the consequences do not bear thinking about.

'I have had Ted for about a year and he was quite a timid dog when I first got him but we soon became very close. He had been badly abused and the bond we formed was incredibly close.

Despite rescuing Ted from being abused, Josie says she now feels she owes him a debt for saving her 

'I feel as though it is fate that we found each other. I saved him, then he saved me.

'He is not normally very affectionate, and would never usually paw me in such a way. That is why I knew something was wrong.'

The first symptom of breast cancer most women notice is a lump or an area of thickened tissue in their breast.

Most breast lumps (90 per cent) aren't cancerous, but it's always best to have them checked by your doctor.

You should see your GP if you notice any of the following:

Josie, a mother-of-four and grandmother-of-two, bought Ted after seeing him for sale online, but when she turned up at his home she realised there was something wrong.

Ted's owners barely spoke to her and bundled the animal into her car straight away before Josie took him to the vets.

She was told that Ted had suffered a blow to the head and that it was highly likely he had been kept in a very small cage.

His muscles had wasted away and he was barely able to walk.

But after some tender loving care from Josie Ted made a dramatic recovery.

Josie added: 'We are very close. I have had other dogs, but never formed as strong a bond with them as I have done with Ted. He saved my life.'

Josie, who lives with her delivery driver husband Brian, 47, had the lump removed mid-December 2014 and last week learned that the cancer had not spread. 

She suffers from benign breast disease which causes regular lumps, which are harmless and never usually worry her.

Stay-at-home-mum Josie now wants to let other people know that they should take notice of dogs if they start to draw attention to a certain area of their owners' body.

Josie, mother to Hannah, 26, James, 24, Lewis, 21, and Megan, 14, said: 'I think a lot of people would probably just push a dog away if it started clawing at their chest, but dog owners should take notice, because Ted really did save my life.'

She faces 18 weeks of chemotherapy and four weeks of radiotherapy to ensure the cancer does not return, but her prognosis is good.
