Rio Ferdinand's protracted move to Queens Park Rangers is in danger due to a last minute hitch over wages.

Sportsmail revealed last week that a deal for the former England international to join the Barclays Premier League newcomers was agreed in principle by both parties.

It is understood Ferdinand, who has been released by Manchester United, had agreed to sign a contract at QPR on less than a third of his £200,000-per-week deal at Old Trafford.

Done deal? Rio Ferdinand's move to QPR is in jeopardy after the club has decided to re-think his salary

But a disagreement over the 35-year-old's salary is now threatening the deal.

The newly-promoted side are believed to have had a last minute re-think over the terms they were offering Ferdinand.

The central-defender has since returned to Brazil to continue in his capacity as a World Cup pundit for the BBC without signing a contract.

Rangers boss Harry Redknapp is hopeful of concluding a deal for Ferdinand, with club officials continuing to work on a solution.

Ferdinand was even making housing plans to return to the south with the knowledge that he would be reuniting himself with Redknapp, the man who gave him his senior debut at West Ham.

Rangers chiefs are being careful not to repeat the financial mistakes made during their previous stint in the top-flight.

Meanwhile, midfielder Ale Faurlin has signed a new one year contract at Loftus Road.
