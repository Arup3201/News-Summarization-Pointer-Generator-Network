She's famous for her love of recycling outfits and the Duchess 
of Cambridge kept up her thrifty reputation on tour in New Zealand today.

Kate, 31, took part in a friendly race in America's Cup sailing boats on Auckland's Waitemata Harbour - and twice beat her husband - wearing a look we've seen not once, but twice before.

The Duchess donned blue J Brand skinny jeans and a £48 ME + EM striped Breton-style top with a £79.99 navy Zara jacket and cool Ray Ban sunglasses.

Deja vuz! The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrive to the Viaduct Basin to sail with Team New Zealand - but haven't we seen that outfit before, Kate?

Familiar: Kate, known for her love of recycling her clothes, was seen wearing the same look when she played volleyball at the Olympic park in October (left) and at the Olympic village in the year before (right)

She loves her stripes: Kate, pictured in 2012 with Tessa Jowell (L) and Mayor of the Olympic Village Sir Charles Allen (R) during a visit to the Team GB accommodation flats in the Athletes Village

Similar style: The Duchess of Cambridge shows how much she loves the jeans and blazer combo as she arrived at Team GB House in the Westfield Centre, Stratford, in 2012

Kate was seen wearing the exact same look at an event at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in East London in her role as patron of the charity SportsAid last October, where she showed off her toned stomach following the birth of Prince George.

Avid fans will notice that Kate,
 who is well known for recycling her wardrobe staples, wore a very 
similar navy outfit at the 2012 Olympics Games when she paid a visit to 
the athletes in the Olympic village, too.

While Kate arrived wearing her beloved
 4in corked shoes, which hit the headlines when swimmer 
Rebecca Adlington told the Duchess she 
loved her £245 navy wedges, the Duchess swapped them for Sebago Bala flats as she hopped on board - a much more practical choice for today's activity.

Today's casual outfit was a far cry from the more glamorous bespoke Jenny Packham gown she wore, which had been hand-stitched with silver beading to represent New Zealand's national emblem.

The
 Queen has long employed the trick of incorporating an item of national 
importance in her outfits when on foreign tours - and it appears that 
the Duchess has now taken a leaf out of her book.

The Duchess did, however, add some sparkle to her pared-back outfit with a pair of £695 Grace Collection White Topaz and Diamond stud earrings by London jeweller Kiki McDonough - one of her favourites.

Today, both Kate and William had some high-powered teammates - Kate was paired with Team New Zealand skipper Dean Barker while William raced with Grant Dalton, the team's manager and a veteran round-the-world racer.

Behind the wheel: Kate races with Team New Zealand during a match race on the Waitemata Harbour

The royal couple is on a three-week tour of New Zealand and Australia.

It rained again as it has most days on their tour but that didn't put off hundreds of people who gathered on Auckland's waterfront to greet them.

After the racing, the couple took a ride on an amphibious craft called Sealegs, which drove out of the water at Westpark Marina to the delight of the crowds.

The couple plan to visit Hamilton on Saturday.

Team mates: Prince William and Kate visit Emirates Team New Zealand base, home to New Zealand's Americas Cup Team. The Duke and Duchess informally raced around Auckland Harbour

In her jeans: The Duchess of Cambridge wore J Brand jeans three days in a row in Canada in 2011. Kate purchased the 811 style from Trilogy's Chelsea store over 3 years ago (among other styles that she has bought from the store over the years) and has been wearing them ever since

Style credentials: The Duchess of Cambridge 
waves as she leaves after a visit to a SportsAid Athlete Workshop in a 
striped ensemble last October

Wardrobe staple: Kate has worn her £245 4in wedges countless times, which are by Russell and Bromley (right shows the cork shoes in black)

Thrifty Kate strikes again! Kate wore the same 
MaxMara wrap around jersey dress for her flight to New Zealand that she wore during a 
visit to Hope House in London in February last year
