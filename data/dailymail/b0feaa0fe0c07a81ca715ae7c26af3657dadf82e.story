Hollywood is bracing itself for one of its most disappointing months in recent memory after a series of big budget productions have bombed at the box office.

This summer has seen fierce competition at cinemas with over 20 films boasting budgets of $100 million (£66million) or more fighting to fill the seats.

Top of the flops appears to be Disney's $225 million 'The Lone Ranger' which despite starring roles for Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer, only brought in $29 million on it's opening July 4 weekend.

Bombs away: Disney's $225 million 'The Lone Ranger' starring Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer brought in a disappointing $29 million on its opening weekend

It followed a disastrous opening for Sony’s $150 million 'White House Down' which garnered a paltry $25 million on the weekend of June 28.

And there are serious concerns over Guillermo del Toro's $180 million sci-fi monster romp 'Pacific Rim' which is expected to open at around $30 million this weekend.

'R.I.P.D.', the Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds thriler about a team of undead police officers is projected to pull in less than $15 million, despite a hefty $130 million production budget.

White House Down had a disappointing opening weekend and R.I.P.D. is not projected to open with a boom

And even the normally reliable Dreamworks production house could be left with a stinker as 'Turbo', a $135 million family film about a snail with dreams of speed, is also expected to do badly when it opens on the same weekend.

It's a far cry from July 2012 when the last in the Christopher Nolan Batman series 'Dark Knight Rises' puled in $168 million.

The Lone Ranger($225m)   $29m

White House Down($150m) $25m

Pacific Rim ($180m)           $30m (Projected)

R.I.P.D.($130m)                   $15m (projected)

'Turbo', ($135m)                  $30m (projected)

But according to the report on thewrap.com there are some encouraging signs on the horizon.

Sony’s $80 million 'Grown Ups 2 starring Adam Sandler is expected to bring in between $40 million and $45 million 

And Fox's X-Men spin-off 'Wolverine', starring Hugh Jackman is projected to draw a healthy $70 million when it opens on July 26.

Tinseltown VIPs will be hoping the dreadful JUly wil prove to be mearly a blip between record-breaking grosses in May and June from the likes of 'Man of Steel' and 'Monsters U'.August will begin with opening weekends for Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg's 'Two Guns', 'The Smurfs 2', 'Elysium, starring Matt Damon and Jodie Foster, 'We’re the Millers,' 'Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters' and 'Planes'.
