Its a project that involved 9,534 photographs taken over 27 years.

And artist Karl Baden has no plans of stopping the ongoing visual document he first thought up as a student in 1975, and which has culminated in a stunning time lapse film showing the process of aging.

'I’ll stop when I’m dead,' he told Boston Magazine.

'If I’m dead, I won’t know what will happen with [my project] from there, but the plan is to have an institution acquire it in some form.'

Baden is now 61 and he started 'Every Day' - which is usually updated daily online - at 34-years-old.

The daily task is part of a decades-long examination of the role that mortality plays in people’s lives, and, more obviously, how age changes one’s appearance.

Barden said it also serves as a 'meta comment' on the idea of obsession, and doing something repetitiously.

'Artists need to be obsessive to get the work that they have to get done, done,' he said.

'They have to have some inner drive to do it; this is taking it to another step. This is a comment on the obsession and obsessively making work.

'The idea of making and taking photographs has a lot to do with documenting things over time.

'Many people have attempted that in terms of looking at cities, and locations, or even one’s own family—kids growing up, that sort of thing.

'So I felt that it might be interesting to take it a step further.'

The process for 'Every Day' has been something reminiscent of Groundhog Day.

Baden wakes up, gets ready for work or the weekend, and then simply snaps the photo using the same camera and the same lighting that he has used for nearly three decades.

The type of film has changed over time, he said, because the older products he once relied on are no longer made.

'I don’t do anything to change my face intentionally. I don’t grow beards or mustaches, and I keep my hair the same,' he said.

'I don’t use any unusual angles, and I don’t use any unusual lenses, or filters, or lighting sources.

'I try to keep all artistic conceits out of the picture.

'I try to achieve identical images, but I can’t always, because I’m human, and I make mistakes, and the camera makes mistakes.

'Those are all accepted as part of the project.'

Baden said he could only remember one time that he forgot to take a portrait of himself, when he was rushing out the house to teach a class.

Once he takes a photo, he collects the negatives and keeps them organized and well documented in a safe place, and brings them out when he needs to make prints, or in the case of one undertaking, he made to show the progression of age: a video.

The latest video had to be edited extensively, with only about 2000-2,500 of the 9,543 pictures being featured.

The video, which has been uploaded to YouTube, is called It Aint Over Yet: 24 Years, 8 months, 11 days, in 2 minutes.
