The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased more than 120 points today - closing to an all-time high as an economic recovery appears to be taking hold.

The index is up nearly 9 per cent this 
year, capping an incredible comeback.

The Dow has more than doubled since
hitting a 12-year low in March 2009.

The growth is believed to have been 
powered by China's strong economic growth targets, a recovering housing 
market, and a jump in European retail sales.

Taking care of business: The Dow Jones industrial average jumped nearly 100 points early Tuesday before closing at an all-time high

The
Dow gained 125.95 points - or 1 per cent - to close at 14,253.77, 
surpassing its previous record high of 14,198 set on October 11, 2007.

The last time the Dow was this high, Apple had just sold its first iPhone and George W. Bush had another year as president.

The U.S. housing market had yet to implode, and the financial crisis that brought down Lehman Brothers was still a year away.

Despite the stunning gains in the stock market since then, the U.S. economy has not fared nearly as well. 

Unemployment was just 4.7 per cent when the Dow last reached a record, versus the 7.9 per cent it is today.

Stocks have rallied powerfully this 
year, impressing even market's most ardent skeptics, on optimism that 
the housing market is recovering and companies are slowly starting to 
hire again.

Strong corporate earnings have also helped increase demand.

The Dow is already up 9 per cent so far this year, which many would consider a respectable gain for a full year.

The market has benefited from economic stimulus from the Federal Reserve and other global central banks. 

The U.S. central bank is buying $85billion each month in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities to keep long-term interest rates very low.

Tuesday's gains were also driven by industrial and technology stocks - a signal that investors are optimistic about the economy, since those companies stand to gain the most when the economy recovers. 

More stable, conservative stocks like
utilities and consumer staples also rose, but trailed the market. IBM, 
United Technologies and the manufacturer 3M led the Dow higher.

Encouragement: The news that home prices rose at the fastest pace in almost six years in January also led to the Dow surge

Investors
today received another piece of positive news on the U.S. economy - a 
report that U.S. service companies grew in February at the fastest pace 
in a year, thanks to higher sales and more new orders.

The gain suggests higher taxes have yet to slow consumer spending on services.

Home builder PulteGroup rose 42 cents to $20.12 following news that home prices rose at the fastest pace in almost six years in January, a sign that the housing market is gaining momentum as it nears the spring selling season.

Home prices rose 9.7 per cent in January from a year ago and had the biggest gain since April 2006, according to data released by CoreLogic.

Walt Disney Co. and 3M Co. also made the best of the market, hitting all-time highs by the end of the day.

Outside the Dow, Google continued its gains with the stock rising 2.1 per cent to close at $838.60, an all-time high for the Web giant. Google is the highest-priced stock in the Standard & 
Poor's 500 index.

The S&P rose 14 points, or 1 per cent, to 1,539. The S&P is
also within striking distance of its record close of 1,565.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to its price, rose one basis point to 1.89 per cent.

Among other stocks making big moves, Ascena Retail Group gained $1.73 to $18.30 after the clothing store reported stronger-than-expected sales in its most recent quarter.
