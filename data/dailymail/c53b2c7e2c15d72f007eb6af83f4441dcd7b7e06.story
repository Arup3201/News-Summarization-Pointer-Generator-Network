Baby food maker Gerber is being sued by the U.S. government after allegedly claiming falsely that its Good Start Gentle formula can prevent or reduce allergies in children.

In a complaint filed on Thursday in court, the Federal Trade Commission said the New Jersey-based firm put labels on the product saying it would 'reduce the risk of developing allergies'.

It claims these stickers contained bogus information, including the suggestion that the formula was the first to meet government approval for reducing the risk of allergies.

One label, released by the FTC, shows a youngster staring wide-eyed at the camera, with the caption: 'I love mommy's eyes, not her allergies'.

The Commission says it wants Gerber Products Co - which is also doing business as Nestlé Infant Nutrition - to pull its claim from formula labels and advertisements.

At some point, it may even ask the court to require that Gerber issue refunds to consumers for the $20-plus packages sold since 2011.

However, in a statement, Gerber said it had not violated the law.

'We are defending our position because we believe we have met, and will continue to meet, all legal requirements to make these product claims,' Kevin Goldberg, Gerber's vice president and general counsel, said.

The main issue in the case is how far Gerber went when claiming that its formula could prevent atopic dermatitis, a skin rash known as baby eczema that can be caused by allergies. 

According to the FTC, Gerber had petitioned the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2009 for permission to connect its use of partially hydrolyzed whey proteins to reducing atopic dermatitis.

The FDA agreed, but only if Gerber qualified its statement by making clear that there was 'little scientific evidence' for the relationship.

Instead, packages of Good Start Gentle in 2011 suggested it was the first formula approved by the FDA to reduce the risk that a baby would develop allergies in general.

No qualifier was included, and the labels could easily be interpreted to mean that the formula could prevent a child from developing life-threatening food or environmental allergies, the FTC said. 

'Parents trusted Gerber to tell the truth about the health benefits of its formula, and the company's ads failed to live up to that trust,' said Jessica Rich, director of the FTC's bureau of consumer protection.

'Gerber didn't have evidence to back up its claim that Good Start Gentle formula reduces the risk of babies developing their parents' allergies.'

In its statement, released on Thursday, Gerber reiterated the claim that its formula can help prevent baby eczema, and said the company had been authorized by the FDA to feature that claim.

'Gerber always has and will continue to treat its mission of delivering nutrition and benefits to infants as its top priority,' Mr Goldberg wrote.

'We believe the information conveyed in our marketing is important for parents who have children at risk for atopic dermatitis, the most common allergy in infancy.'

With Gerber suggesting that it refuses to settle, the case will likely be decided by a district court in New Jersey, where the firm's headquarters is located.

The FTC has not yet determined  whether consumer refunds may be necessary.

Nestle shares closed up 0.4 percent in Swiss trading.
