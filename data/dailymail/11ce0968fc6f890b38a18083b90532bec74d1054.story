The number of babies being adopted has fallen to a record low despite repeated promises to tackle delays and red tape.

Just 76 children under the age of one were adopted last year – down from 95 in 2010 and 287 a decade ago.

The trend suggests Coalition promises to speed up adoptions and sweep away apartheid-style race rules have yet to help.

The overall number of adoptions rose slightly last year, fuelled by an increase in the number of one to four year olds finding permanent homes.

Charities urged caution in interpreting the figures as the beginning of an upward trend.

But the British Association for Adoption and Fostering said delays were a 'serious issue' and the system needed to better meet children’s needs.

Child development experts have warned that major upheavals early in life are emotionally damaging yet many babies are passed between foster parents and carers before they find a permanent home.

Barriers to adoption include an ideology prevalent among some social workers who believe it is bad for a child to be brought up by parents of another race.

Many adoptions have also been prevented on the grounds that parents are too old or too unhealthy.

Figures published yesterday by the Office for National Statistics show 4,777 children were adopted in 2011 – either from state care, from abroad or by step-parents – compared with 4,550 in 2010.

Only 76 children under one were taken on by British families in 2011, down from 95 in 2010.

But the number of under-ones adopted 
fell to its lowest level since records began in 1974, when the figure 
was 5,172. As recently as 1990, the figure was 969. The number of 
children aged five to 17 being adopted also declined. Councils report 
that older age groups are harder to place.

At the same time, soaring numbers of children are being taken from their families and put in care following the Baby P scandal four years ago.

Guidance to councils issued last year stripped away some of the myths blocking potentially suitable adoptions.

And the Department for Education has started publishing 'scorecards' to reveal which councils are failing to ensure children in their care are adopted quickly.

Meanwhile a new bill aims to speed up the adoption of babies and ban social workers from blocking adoptions on the grounds of race or ethnicity if an otherwise suitable family is available.

Mission: David Cameron has said he is determined to speed up the adoption process, which currently takes more than two years

Under a new 'Fostering for Adoption' scheme, babies will be placed with foster families who want to adopt to reduce disruption to children in care.

Fostering by approved adopters will become 'standard practice' for children under the age of one.

Backing the scheme, Education Secretary Michael Gove, who was adopted at four months, said: 'My hope is that children don’t have to move again and again before finding a permanent home.

'The Government owes it to children to encourage more parents to consider adoption. In reforming the system we are determined to make sure the child’s interests are paramount.'

John Simmonds of the BAAF said: 'We know delay is a serious issue and these figures remind everybody about the need to ensure that the system as a whole is as child centred as possible and clearly on the side of the child.'

He welcomed the increase in adoptions among one to four year olds.

A Department for Education spokesman said: 'We are committed to overhauling the entire adoption system to give more vulnerable children the chance of a loving, stable home with adoptive parents. That’s why we are changing the law and calling for urgent action.'
