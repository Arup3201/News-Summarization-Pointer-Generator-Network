Falling out: Clive Davis has hit back at Kelly Clarkson's accusations of 'misinformation'

He was accused by Kelly Clarkson of 'spreading false information' about her, along with suffering 'memory lapses' in his new tell-all memoir The Soundtrack of My Life.

But Clive Davis is standing by his comments and  defended himself via a Twitter post entitled: 'Statement from @CliveDavis regarding @Kelly_Clarkson'

He wrote: 'I am truly very sorry that she has decided to take issue with what I know to be an accurate depiction of our time together,' he writes. 

Kelly wrote a long open letter accusing the Sony Music chief of spreading 'misinformation' about her after the record executive claimed she broke into
'hysterical sobbing' when he demanded that her hit 'Since U Been 
Gone' be included on her album, Breakaway.

Kelly
- whose stellar career was guided by Davis after she won American Idol -
lashed out, saying: 'I refuse to be bullied and I just have to clear up
his memory lapses and misinformation for myself and for my fans.

'It feels like a violation. Growing up is awesome because you learn you don't have to cower to anyone - even Clive Davis.'

Davis refutes Kelly's post, which includes accusations of 'memory lapses.'

'Before the book was published, I had every fact checked with five independent individuals who were present on a daily basis throughout it all,' he wrote.

Response: The music mogul took to his Twitter page, maintaining his depiction in The Soundtrack of my Life

'The chapter as it is written was 
thoroughly verified by each and every one of them. I stand by the 
chapter as written in my book. At the same time I wish, and will always 
wish, Kelly's talent and her career to soar to ever new heights.'

Davis also paid tribute to the American Idol winner's talents in his post.

'As anyone who has read The Soundtrack of
My Life knows, I think Kelly Clarkson is a tremendous vocal talent and
performer.

'In the book, I provide an in-depth look at our years 
together during which we shared major multi-platinum success, as well as
a few creative differences.'

Response: Kelly wrote a strongly worded letter to her fans via Twitter, accusing her former mentor of 'misinformation' and 'bullying'

In The Soundtrack of My Life. the 80-year-old music executive - who discovered Whitney Houston -
tells how he fell out with Kelly over her desire to help pen her own 
songs on her third album, My December.

Davis recalled that he didn't believe the material contained a number 
one hit and told the singer's manager he was 'out of his mind' to 
believe otherwise.

He also wrote about a meeting with Kelly in in which he told her that My December was 'a pop album that still needs pop hits'.

But in a lengthy statement posted on Whosay, Kelly wrote: 'So I just heard Clive Davis is releasing a memoir and spreading false information about me and my music. 

'First,
he says I burst into "hysterical sobbing" in his office when he 
demanded Since You Been Gone be on my album. Not true at all. His 
stories and songs are mixed up.'

Overjoyed: Kelly picked up her third Grammy of her career at the music awards ceremony in LA on February 10

Glittering: Kelly's career has gone from strength to strength since she won the first season of American Idol

She
said they rowed after Kelly insisted that she wanted more guitars added
to the original demo track - and Davis did not, saying she eventually 
prevailed, adding: 'I couldn't be more proud of the life of that song. I
resent him dampening that song in any way.

'But, yes, I did cry in his office once. I cried after I played him a song I had written about my life called "Because Of You."

Controversy: Davis makes the claims in his new book The Soundtrack of My Life

'I
cried because he hated it and told me verbatim that I was a "s****y 
writer" who should be grateful for the gifts that he bestows upon me.

'He continued on about how the song didn't rhyme and how I should just 
shut up and sing. This was devastating coming from a man who I, as a 
young girl, considered a musical hero and was so honoured to work with.

'But
I continued to fight for the song and the label relented. And it became
a worldwide hit. He didn't include that in the book.'

Kelly revealed that she was hurt by his accusations about her album My December and its lack of 'pop hits'- and the claims that it didn't chart to well because she co-wrote it.

She also accused Davis, currently the Chief Creative Officer of Sony Music Entertainment, of actively trying to 'sabotage' the album.

She said  'Well, first let me say, I've co-penned many of my "pop hits." Secondly, My December went platinum (It sold 20,000 less than All I Ever Wanted which followed My December.) Hardly a huge failure.

'Never Again, the ONLY single they released in the US from that record was a Top 10 hit.

'I am very proud of that and I have my fans to thank. But, again, what's most interesting about his story is what he leaves out: He doesn't mention how he stood up in front of his company at a convention and belittled me and my music and completely sabotaged the entire project.

Engaged: Kelly Clarkson and her fiance, Brandon Blackstock, beam at the Grammys earlier this month

'It never had a chance to reach it's 
full potential. My December was an album I needed to make for myself for
many reasons and the fact that I was so completely disregarded and 
disrespected was so disheartening, there really aren't words to 
explain….'

Kelly, who is signed to RCA records, won her third Grammy award earlier this month for Best Pop Vocal Album for her fifth studio album, Stronger.

And
the star, who is engaged to music manager Brandon Blackstock, finished 
her message by writing: 'Anyway, I love my job. I love my music. I love 
my fans. I love my label and all of my professional relationships… now. 
And I am grateful for Clive for teaching me to know the difference.

'Cheers to another amazing year.'
