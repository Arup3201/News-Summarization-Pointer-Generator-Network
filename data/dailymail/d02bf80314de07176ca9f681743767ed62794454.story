For a man once criticised for  not leaving a tip, David Cameron was leaving nothing to chance  on one of his ‘date nights’ with wife Samantha.

After the couple shared a meal costing about £45, Mr Cameron  left £50 for staff at a pizza restaurant in a show of generosity that left  fellow diners wondering whether  he had saved on his bill with a discount voucher.

The Prime Minister was dining in Soho after watching a portrayal of himself  in the West End play The Audience, and happily posed for a photograph with two women diners.

He ordered a £12.75 rustichella pizza,
 while Mrs Cameron opted for a £10.90 lasagna classica.

The couple 
shared a  bottle of red wine and a portion of dough balls, but the meal 
at Pizza Express still would have cost less than £50 had it not been for
 the hefty tip.

One diner suggested on Twitter that Mr
 Cameron may even have been feeling flush after saving some money on his
 order by using a discount coupon.

Eleanor Thom tweeted: ‘Red wine and 
dough balls, that’s the upper classes for you. I think he’s got some 
vouchers #pmpizzaexpress.’

Other diners said the PM appeared 
relaxed during the meal on Friday – just hours before world leaders flew
 in for the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland

‘You’d never have guessed he was  about to host Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin – he seemed chilled out,’ a fellow diner said.

David Cameron came under fire in 2011 for failing to leave a tip for a waitress who said she was too busy to deliver two cappuccinos and an espresso to his table in Montevarchi, Italy.

Francesca Ariani, 27, failed to recognise the PM and said he would have to carry the coffees to the table himself – which he duly did.

When the Camerons left, they paid the 3.10 euro bill without leaving a tip.

Mr Cameron returned to the  bar a week later with his daughter Nancy to clear up the misunderstanding. He ordered drinks costing 5.10 euros and left a ten euro note.

Miss Ariani said the PM apologised to her for ‘any fuss that had been created’.

Earlier the Camerons had watched Dame 
Helen Mirren play the Queen at London’s Gielgud Theatre. In one scene 
the monarch falls asleep during a meeting with the Prime Minister, who 
is played by Rufus Wright.

Mr Cameron and his wife, who was dressed casually in a red dress and blazer, went backstage after the show to meet the stars.

They emerged from the stage door to be
 greeted by a mob of fans who had gathered in the hope of seeing Dame 
Helen. The Camerons were then escorted to their car by protection 
officers.

The Prime Minister, who has been 
spotted at Pizza Express on a number of occasions, has previously said 
that he and his wife have weekly ‘date nights’.

‘We have one night every  week where 
we either stay in and do nothing or go out on our own,’ he revealed. ‘We
 have a couple of favourite Italian restaurants in north Kensington.’

Mr Cameron has described himself as a 
‘romantic’, and said that he can still recall his June 1996 wedding 
night ‘minute by minute’.
