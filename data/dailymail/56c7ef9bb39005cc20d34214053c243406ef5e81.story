Bowler Sean Abbott has returned to the cricket pitch a week after the tragic accident which claimed the life of batsman Phillip Hughes. 

A bouncer delivered by Abbott struck Hughes, 25, in the back of the neck during the Sheffield Shield clash at the Sydney Cricket Ground last Tuesday. He died surrounded in hospital by family and friends on Thursday.

Abbott's team, the New South Wales Blues, today rallied around each other at a training session at the SCG. 

'It's the whole squad that really needs everyone's support,' a spokeswoman for Cricket NSW told Daily Mail Australia.

'We want to keep supporting them as a group there were a lot of Phillip's friends in the team,' she said. 

The team will fly together to Macksville, the felled cricketer's hometown on the NSW north coast, on Wednesday morning and return Thursday.

The Sydney Cricket Ground will also be open to the public tomorrow for the wider community to join celebrations of Hughes' life.

As Macksville readies for an influx of 5000 mourners tomorrow, a family member told Daily Mail Australia they were planning to console Abbott. 

'We can't wait to see Sean Abbott tomorrow and give him a big kiss and hug,' the family member told Daily Mail Australia.

'We just want to tell him it was freak accident and he cannot think he had anything to do with it.

'No one is blaming him. We want to hug him and tell him that everything is okay.'

Late last week, friends and mentors at the Baulkham Hills Cricket Club, the north-western Sydney institution where Abbott grew up belting balls, joined countless Australians in rallying around the up-and-coming-cricketer. 

When one of 'Sabs's' team-mates dropped a crucial catch as a youngster, he was always the good sportsman who would pat them on the back and reassure them it would be OK, they said.  

Ian Chatman, who managed Abbott's junior team for about eight years and witnessed his first century, told Daily Mail Australia he was a grounded young man who was 'loved by everyone, and still is.' 

'He was really loved by his team-mates, and he cared about them as well,' said Mr Chatman, who said Abbott would be 'devastated' by Tuesday's events. 

'He was always making sure that you know, if someone dropped a catch, he'd be over there patting them on the back saying, "Don't worry about it, it's okay".'  

Hughes' sister Megan and Australian skipper Michael Clarke both consoled the devastated cricketer in the immediate aftermath of his friend's death. And they were far from alone.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten both spoke in support of the struggling cricketer.

Former Australian national Test captain Adam Gilchrist tweeted: 'May those footprints in the sand now support another young man in need. #SeanAbbott'.

Abbott, who Club sources said was a focused and mature player even in his youth, is an inspiration for many of the young people who take to the pitch at 'Baulko'.

'We're very proud of him for being our first Australian representative,' said Baulkham Hills Cricket Club Vice President Peter McLoughlin.  

His love of sport was encouraged at Hills Sports High School, near Seven Hills in Sydney's west, and he was playing representative cricket for Parramatta by his mid-teens. 

Abbott, who has rugby league in his blood, has had a stellar 2014 on the pitch despite the recent accident.

He came to the attention of national selectors in May when he took out the Steve Waugh Medal, the Sheffield Shield's best player of the season - a high honour.  

'He's a genuine type of guy who's worked hard to get there and he knows where he came from, if you know what I mean,' Mr McLoughlin told Daily Mail Australia. 

'All kids want to be Allan Border or Steve Waugh or bloody something and when you see a bloke who played for your club, they all know hard work will get them there, hopefully.' 

Mr Chatman said: 'He'll just be so devastated it's a ball he bowled. For him, I know he'll really struggle.'

But, Mr Chatman said, he's got plenty of support.
