Fraud: Conmen are using fake bottles, such as the ones pictured, to dupe wealthy wine connoisseurs

Wealthy wine connoisseurs are being duped into buying fake bottles of vintage French wine, it has been revealed.

The huge fraud not only sheds light on an increasingly sophisticated counterfeit trade, but highlights how little some self-styled 'experts' really know about wine.

One billionaire businessman unknowingly spent more than £3million on between 500 and 600 bottles of counterfeit Bordeaux wine.

Others are believed to have spent similar amounts of money - but are too embarrassed to confess to being the victims of fraud. 

The fake bottles - most of which were picked up in China - were exposed by French customs and fraud agents.

They are among thousands proved to be fake at a specialist lab in Bordeaux, run by the French Finance Ministry. 

Some are outrageous amalgamations of vintage French wine, such as bottles with labels reading 'Luxembourg' and 'produit de France'.

However, others are just trying to give consumers a taste of glamour - with 'Chatelet Cheval Blanc' imitating the 1947 Chateau Cheval Blanc, one of France's finest wines.

To the untrained eye, some of the labels might appear real - but they are, in fact, too new looking and printed on the wrong kind of paper.

Conmen can earn millions of pounds through producing counterfeit wine - with bottles of Cheval Blanc currently selling for a staggering $11,5000 at auction, according to truebottle.com.

'Wines are becoming a currency in themselves,' said Spiros Malandrakis, a senior analyst of the alcoholic drinks market at Euromoniter.

'And
as with every currency, at some point, people want to find ways to 
manipulate that and make more money.'

Alarmingly, fraudsters are becoming increasingly sophisticated 
as bottle prices rise due to huge 
demand in new markets, such as Asia.

Many purchase old, empty bottles from the most prestigious 
French vineyards, so that the wine passes tests that sample the bottle's glass
or inspect the label.

A recent search on eBay revealed several old, 
empty bottles were for sale, including a 1958 Chateau Lafite Rothschild,
a 1928 Chateau Margaux and a 1971 Romanee Conti - all of which are some
of the most counterfeited wines.

For this reason, several wineries have begun laser-engraving their bottles with unique serial numbers to deter conmen.

Deterrence: Many genuine bottles now feature hologrammed or bar-coded stickers that help prevent fraud

Others
are experimenting with hologrammed or bar-coded stickers - placed half 
on the bottle, half on the 'capsule' (the foil that covers the cork) - 
which will shred if removed.

The Bordeaux winegrowers' professional association has even created an app - called Smart Bordeaux - which provides information on individual wines and wineries.

Bernard Medina, who runs the specialist lab in Bordeaux, performs authenticity tests on suspected counterfeit wine products on a daily basis.

Counterfeiting has plagued the wine industry for as long as the beverage has been produced.

In
the 18th century, King Louis XV ordered the makers of Cotes du Rhone to
brand their barrels with 'CDR' before export to prevent fraud.

In
China, criminals took advantage of the country's weakness: consumers who were new to wine, but had the money to buy counterfeit brands for show.

This resulted in an explosion of fake products, whose labels featured the names - or near names - of as many famous vineyards and locales as possible.

Today, the counterfeit trade is 
becoming increasingly sophisticated as bottle 
prices rise due to huge demand in new markets, such as Asia.

It
is impossible to know the size of fake wine industry as many sales
happen privately - with many victims too embarrassed to report fake products.

However,
experts agree that the quantity of rare bottles from illustrious 
vineyards being auctioned is just too high to not include fakes.

These include measuring isotopes to determine which country a wine comes from, and measuring the trace radioactivity of bottles to determine their age.

Neither of these tests is definitive - but when put together, they can generally identify any fakes.

However, counterfeit bottles still make it into both consumer and business markets across the world.

Billionaire businessman Bill Koch, whose cellar includes 43,000
bottles of wine, has become a vocal 
crusader against fakes after becoming the victim of fraud.

Since starting to collect wine about 40 years ago, he has bought some of the most sought-after beverages in the world - 
including counterfeit bottles that purported to be part of Thomas Jefferson's 
private collection.

In total, he has unknowingly spent a staggering $5million (£3.05million) on between 500 and 600 bottles of fake wine.

Mr Koch said one of the main issues affecting the wine industry is that forgeries are dealt with in a quiet, discrete manner.

He
said many businessman opt to swallow their losses, instead of admitting
their own ignorance - adding: 'There's a code of silence in the entire 
industry'.

Fabien Teitgen, who is in charge of winemaking at Chateau 
Smith Haut Lafitte in Bordeaux, added: 'I think the ostrich strategy - 
hiding yourself and saying we'll figure it out later - is not 
satisfying.

'It is best to speak about it openly and let consumers know what means there 
are to verify that they have the right product.'

However, it is believed not all wineries feel the same way - with some declaring their wine is 'too good to be faked'.
