A high-tech centre in Scotland is giving specialist prosthetic treatment to military amputees. The app-controlled Touch Bionics hand is pictured

Gone are the days of solid rubber prosthetics.

From 3D-printed limbs to titanium legs and hands controlled by apps, advances in technology are revolutionising the industry.

Now, a new state-of-the-art centre has opened in Scotland to give specialist treatment to military amputees - taking advantage of these developments, and making the technology more mainstream.

The service is based at the WestMARC unit at Southern General Hospital, and at the SMART Centre in Edinburgh.

Patients in Aberdeen, Inverness and Dundee will be able to access services via video link-up.

The units will run alongside the existing NHS prosthetics service, and use specialist prosthetic training and imaging equipment to manufacture new socket technology.

The centre also features a gait laboratory that will study how well patients are walking with their new limbs.

‘Military veterans who have lost limbs in conflict have specific and complex needs due to the nature of their injuries,’ said Health Secretary Alex Neil. ‘That is why we were determined to set up a state-of-the art service employing some of the best new technologies.’

Among the amputees is Ian Robin, 53, whose prosthetic hand, called i-Limb and built by Touch Bionics, is controlled with a smartphone app.

The supermarket store trainer lost his left hand in an accident in 1984. He is now able to control the hand with the app, which can change grip and position.

‘Originally my prosthesis was operated with a cable and it could be moved so the hand opened and closed.

‘This new hand I have, it's like 
chalk and cheese in comparison with the original, the other just did the
 basics and now I can change my movements using an app on my phone.

'I can change the type of grips I have, and the arm reacts to the electric signals sent by my upper arm in the muscle.

‘It has massively improved my life, I can pick up glasses, I can even use it to tie my shoelace.'

Anthony Stickland, 53, lost most of his right leg when he was 17.

At
 the launch of the centre, Stickland demonstrated a system of cameras 
and motion sensors, which specialists are using to create a 3D image of 
how his limb is moving.

The technology works by measuring movement and force, to help assess ways for a patient to get around more easily and put less pressure on their muscles.

Anthony said: ‘My first prosthetic leg was completely metal.  It was designed in the 1950s. What you find is that every time there is a war, the prosthetic limbs improve afterwards.

‘With this new limb I can walk quicker, I can keep the same pace going, it has made life a lot easier. whatever my good leg does, it can copy.’

An army veteran, whose leg was blown off by a mine in the Falkland, has become one of the first patients in Scotland to benefit from funding for military amputees.

the hand is controlled by muscle signals from other parts of his 
arms or back. Jeff Ward, pictured right, lost his leg in the Falklands. He is having his gait analysed in the laboratory at the new prosthetics unit

In a separate project, 3D design 
company Autodesk and the University of Toronto are experimenting with 
different ways of scanning limbs and creating customised 3D prosthetic 
socket models, for use in Uganda and other worn torn regions.

Autodesk
 Meshmixer is used to accurately model the prosthetic socket from the 
scan, to go from 3D model to functional prosthetic.

The
 team is currently experimenting with various printers to improve the 
process and has even implemented new tools in Meshmixer that will help 
make the modelling process easier for the Ugandan technicians.

The World Health Organisation claims as many as 40,000 trained personnel are needed for the production of prosthetic limbs.

With
 Autodesk technology, the team of students expect their sockets will be 
ready for use in Uganda in the near future to help address this need.

Retired Lieutenant Colonel Geoff Ward, 66, was clearing bombs when he stepped on a plastic mine, forcing doctors to amputate his right leg just below his knee.

The grandfather-of-one spent three weeks in hospital before returning to the UK, and within six weeks was back at work after being fitted with his prosthetic limb.

He said: ‘The first foot was just like a plastic lump and reinforced plastic.

'This one moves up and down and around, the foot has a set of springs all made out of carbon fibre - it's 'Formula One' technology.

‘The metal bits that hold it together are all titanium so they're incredibly strong and silicon which goes next to the skin and is all very soft all lined with carbon fibre, it's from a different planet - it's terrific.’
