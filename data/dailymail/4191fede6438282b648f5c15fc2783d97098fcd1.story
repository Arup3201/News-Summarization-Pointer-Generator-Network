Officers investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann are hunting a British paedophile who was in Portugal when a series of sex attacks linked to the case took place, it has been reported.

Roderick Robinson, 77, was arrested at a campsite in the Algarve in 2010 and extradited to Australia - where he was wanted for the 1998 rape of an eight-year-old. He escaped to the Far East following another conviction in the UK in 2012.

Now it is believed that police think he may have evidence about a suspected paedophile ring that operated in the region where the three-year-old went missing in 2007.

The British citizen was arrested at an Olhao campsite, where he had been staying for two months. He had spent the last decade on the run.

At the time of the arrest, the Portuguese police said they had no evidence suggesting that the man had committed any crimes in Portugal but investigated his time in the Algarve and the reasons that brought him to the region.

'Roderick Robinson is a ­notorious and dangerous sex offender. He has shown a pattern of disturbing behaviour ­wherever he has travelled,' a source told the Sunday Mirror.

'He may have vital information which could shed light on the mystery surrounding the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.

'He is wanted on an international arrest warrant after failing to notify British police of his whereabouts and it is vital he is found without delay.'

Scene: Madeleine went missing from a holiday apartment at the Ocean Club resort (pictured) in Praia da Luz as her parents dined at a nearby tapas restaurant. She had been left in the apartment with her twin siblings

Possible sighting: A street in the Praia Da Luz resort where an Irish holiday maker and his wife claim they saw a mystery person with a child at about the same time as Madeleine McCann disappeared in May 2007

Robinson received six months in prison after accepting a plea deal for indecently assaulting the child in Australia and fled to Thailand after he was released, but Thai authorities deported him back to the UK when they found out about his past.

He settled in Brighton, East Sussex, but, despite being made to sign the Sex Offenders Register, was convicted of molesting two girls, five and seven in 2012.

He received a year-long sentence but it was suspended for two years. He changed his name and fled to the Far East soon after.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said they do not comment on ongoing investigations.

Madeleine, then aged three, went missing on May 3, 2007, from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, as her parents Kate and Gerry dined at a nearby tapas restaurant.

The toddler, who lived in Rothley with her family, had been left in the rented apartment at the seaside Ocean Club resort, along with her siblings, twins Sean and Amelie.

Last month Scotland Yard announced that a paedophile suspected of abducting Madeleine McCann had been linked with attacks on another five British girls.

They include a ten-year-old who was sexually assaulted in Praia da Luz two years before three-year-old Madeleine vanished from the resort in the Algarve, British police revealed yesterday.

The attack took place in the ‘heart of the resort’ in 2005 but the victim, now thought to be 19, did not tell her parents at the time.

She only came forward following an appeal by Scotland Yard last month about a lone sex offender already thought to have targeted 12 British families holidaying in the region between 2004 and 2010.

Their apartments were broken into and five young girls were assaulted in their beds by a predator who police believe may be a local binman described as ‘smelly and pot-bellied’.

Since the appeal six other British families have come forward to report that their children aged six to 12 fell victim to the offender over the same period.

Five of those children – including the ten-year-old molested in Praia da Luz – were sexually assaulted and there was one ‘near miss’ when the intruder was disturbed in neighbouring resorts.

Police have received 500 calls about the mystery man said to have ‘a vile interest in young, white, female children’.

Meanwhile, the parents
 of missing Madeleine McCann thanked the public for their unwavering 
support yesterday as they marked the seventh anniversary of their daughter's
 disappearance.

Kate
 and Gerry McCann were joined by around 100 well-wishers, friends and 
relatives at a prayer service in the centre of Rothley, Leicestershire.

The
 open-air service, conducted beside Rothley's War Memorial, saw candles 
lit for all the children around the world who have been taken away from 
their parents against their will.

Speech: During the ceremony, Mrs McCann gave a reading adapted from the words of a song. 'Here we are again, and more significantly, here you are again,' she said. 'Having your support has made a huge difference'

Speaking
 earlier this week, Mrs McCann revealed that she privately returns to 
the Portuguese resort where her daughter disappeared to 'walk those 
streets' and 'look for answers'.

She told 
the BBC that she returns quietly to Praia da Luz at least once or twice a
 year to feel close to her eldest daughter, who would now be 10 years 
old.

Mrs
 McCann's comments came as she backed a revamped alert system, known as 
Child Rescue Alerts, which is triggered when missing children are 
kidnapped or their lives are at risk.

'When a child is abducted, families are devastated and entire communities are torn apart,' she said.

'The agony of not knowing where your child is is almost impossible to imagine.'

She urged members of the public to sign up for system, which will be overhauled later this month.
