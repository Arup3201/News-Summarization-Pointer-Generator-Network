Ulrika Jonsson claimed last night that she was warned by a senior News of the World executive not to leave voicemail messages ‘because they can get those’.

The TV presenter, a former columnist with the newspaper, said she ‘felt very sick’ when also told by the police that her phone may have been hacked.

Miss Jonsson, 43, said on ITV1’s Tonight Programme that she was contacted by detectives about ‘some very important evidence’.

Ms Jonsson will appear on TV tonight in an interview in which she claims she was told by a NotW editorial executive to delete answer phone messages from her mobile

The extraordinary revelation made 
today came as a cousin of Jean Charles de Menezes was told by police 
that their name was found on a hacker's list.

Mr de Menezes, 27, was shot dead by 
counter-terrorism officers hunting would-be suicide bomber Hussain Osman
the day after the failed July 21, 2005 attacks on London.

In another development, glamour model
Abi Titmuss announced that she would be suing the NotW over fears that 
her phone was also hacked.

Glamour model and actress Abi Titmuss is taking legal action against the News of the World after police informed her that her phone may have been hacked.

The former nurse came to prominence in 2003 when she was dating former TV host John Leslie, later launching her own modelling and presenting career. She joins a number of other celebrities and well-known figures who have begun legal proceedings.

Titmuss, 35, has appointed lawyer Charlotte Harris of legal firm Mishcon De Reya, who is already representing Sky Andrew, Leslie Ash and Lee Chapman among others in their claims.

Titmuss's agent said today: 'We can confirm that Abi Titmuss is taking action against the News of the World following notification by the police that her phone was intercepted over a long period of time.'

Titmuss became a familiar face as she supported Leslie when he was accused of rape. The case was dropped by prosecutors.

She went on to become a 'lad's mag' favourite and has gone on to forge an acting career. She is currently in rehearsals for a leading role in Dusk Rings A Bell at the Edinburgh Festival in August.

Earlier
this morning one of the News of the World's former executive editors, 
Neil 'Wolfman' Wallis, a deputy under Andy Coulson was arrested.

Ms Jonsson, whose love life has been in the spotlight on a number of 
occasions over the years, told of her distress when she was contacted by
police about being monitored.

Speaking on ITV1's Tonight 
programme which airs this evening, Ms Jonsson said she was sickened to discover she was being watched.

'I
was contacted by the Met Police on my mobile phone and they left me a 
number and said please call me back we have some very important evidence
we want to show you,' she said.

'There were pin codes, numbers for my
automatic front gate where I lived and the feeling that, according to 
these notes, that I was definitely being watched.

'Immediately
my head started pounding. I felt… I really felt very sick. I felt 
immediately like my stomach was turning. I felt really scared - 
somebody’s been watching or certainly somebody’s been listening to my 
life.'

Presenter Alastair 
Stewart asked her if a senior member of staff at the News of the World 
had warned her to be careful and she responded: 'Yes, someone warned me 
not to leave voicemails.

'Because they can get those. The couldn't intercept text messages but they can get voicemails.'

He probed further: 'An editorial executive at the the News of the World warned you to be cautious.'

To which she replied: 'Indeed.'

Detectives have also told a cousin of Jean Charles de Menezes his number was found on the phone hacking list of a News of the World private investigator.

Other people connected to the young Brazilian shot dead by police marksmen at Stockwell Tube station in 2005 fear they too may have been targeted.

Relatives, campaigners and members of the family's legal team have given police their phone numbers so officers can check whether they were victims of hacking.

His family said that officers from Operation Weeting, Scotland Yard's new phone hacking inquiry, confirmed yesterday that the mobile phone of his cousin Alex Pereira was found on a list compiled by private investigator Glenn Mulcaire.

Andy Coulson, left, was arrested and released on bail until October while Neil Wallis was detained this morning

A spokesman for the Justice4Jean 
campaign said: 'The Menezes family are deeply pained to find their 
phones may have been hacked at a time at which they were at their most 
vulnerable and bereaved.

'They are bewildered as to why the police did not approach them with this information earlier, and fear the police may be attempting to cover up their own wrongdoing once more relating to this case.'

The family of Jean Charles de Menezes raised concerns that their phones may have been hacked

Mr
de Menezes's family today called on David Cameron to widen the scope of
the phone hacking inquiry to look at alleged police leaks to the media 
during the investigation into the Brazilian's death.

Relatives of Mr de Menezes wrote to the 
Prime Minister: 'We are conscious that the newspapers owned by News 
International provided some of the most virulent and often misleading 
coverage around Jean's death and its aftermath.

'Throughout the investigation, misinformation continued to be leaked to the press that attempted to besmirch Jean's character.

'The publication of these lies about his actions on the day of the shooting included false allegations that Jean Charles was wearing a bulky jacket, had failed to stop after a police warning, had jumped the ticket barriers or had acted suspiciously in the moments leading up to his shooting.

'They also related to untrue allegations about his immigration status and even attempts to link him to a rape allegation that could only have emanated from police sources.'
