Not guilty: Green Party MP CAroline Lucas pleaded not guilty to two public order offences

Green Party MP Caroline Lucas yesterday denied two public order offences following a mass protest at a potential fracking site.

The MP for Brighton Pavilion was one of 25 people arrested among hundreds protesting outside the Cuadrilla drilling platform in Balcombe, West Sussex, on August 19.

Miss Lucas, 52, is alleged to have failed to comply with a condition made by a senior police officer under the Public Order Act and obstructed the road to the site. 

Wearing a grey dress and plum-coloured cardigan, she smiled as she entered the dock at Crawley Magistrates’ Court before confirming her name, age and address.

A handful of supporters, including former glamour model turned politician Marina Baker listened to proceedings at the back of the court.

She pleaded not guilty at Crawley Magistrates’ Court and was released on unconditional bail until her trial next year.

Speaking outside court, Miss Lucas said: ‘By joining the peaceful protest I wanted to actively oppose the exploitation of yet more fossil fuels.’

Critics of fracking, in which water and chemicals are pumped into the ground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release gas, fear it could harm water resources and cause small earthquakes, and development of the sites will harm the countryside.

Cuadrilla has since completed its exploratory oil drilling and left the village after more than two months of operations which involved the drilling of a vertical exploration well to a depth of 2,720ft, collecting 294ft of rock samples.

The energy firm also confirmed the presence of hydrocarbons, which can be used for fuel, and said it would apply for planning permission to carry out further testing to determine flow rates.

Sussex Police said the overall cost of the operation, which saw 400 officers at peak periods patrol the area over three months and 125 people arrested, is estimated at about £4 million.

Sussex Crime Commissioner Katy Bourne has applied to the Home Office for financial support to meet the additional cost of policing and drafting in officers from 10 other forces, describing Balcombe as ‘a national issue’.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
