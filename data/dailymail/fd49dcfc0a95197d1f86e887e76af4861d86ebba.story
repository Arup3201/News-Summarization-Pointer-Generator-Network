A Harley Street doctor stole a wallet full of cash that had been left on a table in Starbucks, and threatened to have police officers who arrested him on suspicion of the crime fired, a court heard.

Abdul Choudhuri, 41, claimed the wallet was his after a Singaporean tourist left it on a nearby table by accident in the Nottingham coffee shop.

Dr Choudhuri, who runs cosmetic surgery clinics on London's Harley Street and in Nottingham, then posed as a member of the Crown Prosecution Service to avoid being charged for his crime once arrested a month later. 

Abdul Choudhuri stole the wallet after a Singaporean tourist left it on a table in Starbucks in Nottingham

Kenny Quek left the wallet which contained a 1,000 dollar Singapore bank note on his table in the coffee shop on South Parade, Nottinghamshire, in October 2010 by mistake. 

When he returned, staff realised he was the rightful owner of the wallet and phoned police to report Dr Choudhuri who had earlier said it was his.

Dr Choudhuri returned to the shop a month later and was recognised by barrista Lisa Wright, who phoned the police after noting the cosmetic surgeon's 'shifty' behaviour. 

When police arrived at the scene Dr Choudhuri reportedly hid in the toilets, before threatening to have one of the police officers fired.

Upon his arrest he told the officer: 'I know Dave Walker (a former Nottinghamshire Police Superintendent) and you are going to lose your job', the court heard.

The wallet contained a 1000 dollar Singapore bank note which was discovered in Dr Choudhuri's possession when he was arrested

One of Dr Chouduri's clinics can be found on London's famous Harley Street, a top spot for the city's best medical practices

The Body Perfect clinic which is run by Dr Choudhuri offers surgical and non-surgical cosmetic medical treatments

Prosecutor Jonathan Straw told the a jury
at Nottingham Crown Court: 'Mr Choudhuri is a thoroughly dishonest and 
highly manipulative 
individual who has gone to extreme lengths in order to avoid 
conviction.'

The doctor, whose clinics offer cosmetic treatments including liposuction and laser skin surgery, also posed as a member of the CPS to tell a witness the case had been dropped.

Following the arrest, Mr Straw said Ms Wright received phone calls from a
withheld number claiming the trial had been cancelled.

Mr Straw said the person who made the call claimed to be from the 
Nottingham Witness Protection Scheme which is part of the CPS, but in fact was 
Dr Choudhuri or someone acting on his behalf.

The doctor denies one count of fraud and two counts of perverting the course of justice.

PC Richard Shaw searched a wallet found on him which contained a 1,000 dollar Singapore bank note.

When the case was adjourned to investigate the source of the calls, it emerged an alibi used given by Dr Choudhuri was also allegedly false.

The case continues on Friday.
