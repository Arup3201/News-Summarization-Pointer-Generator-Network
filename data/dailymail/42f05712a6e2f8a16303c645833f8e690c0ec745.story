I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! has been criticised for its lack of ‘diversity’ as the show kicked off its new series in the African jungle starring ten white celebrities.

Radio presenter Yumi Stynes renamed the Channel 10 reality show ‘I’m A White Celebrity Get Me Outta Here’ as the new series started on Sunday night starring the likes of The Brady Bunch's Maureen McCormick, famous for playing Marcia Brady, and model Laura Dundovic.

After weeks of guessing games, the celebrities flew into view in ten helicopters whirring over Kruger National Park where they'll be staying for the next six weeks.

The line-up includes Olympic swimmer Leisel Jones, 29, Australian cricket legend Merv Hughes, former Big Brother runner-up and Gold Logie Award winner Chrissie Swan and 24-year-old comedian Joel Creasey.

I'm A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! kicked off on Sunday night with ten stars entering the African jungle

They will appear in the jungle contest alongside TV personality Andrew Daddo, 48, AFL legend Barry Hall, 37, and lesser known stars Lauren Brant, former Hi-5 member, as well as 27-year-old model and 'professional traveller' Tyson Mayr.

‘Loving @joelcreasey and of course @ChrissieSwan but there are other races in Oz!,’ Stynes wrote. 

She also commented: ‘I've never watched Brady Bunch. Too white. #ImaWhiteCelebAU.’

The Feed host was disappointed with the lack of diversity in the show's line-up

‘Apparently The Block is all white contestants but have never watched it because I live in a cave with no tv but lots of interesting brown pe [sic],’ she added. 

One of Stynes' followers responded: '#ImACelebrityAU even the butterflies are white @yumichild #ImaWhiteCelebAU.'

And comedian Mark Williamson said: 'Shouldn't the show be called I'm a White Celebrity get me out of here? #ImACelebrityAU.' 

Film critic Marc Fennell posted a picture of the full cast on Twitter, writing: ‘And people tell me there’s no diversity problem on Australian TV.’ 

The Feed host told Daily Mail Australia that although he is a big fan of I’m A Celeb and likes ‘a number of people on it’ he was not so happy with the lack of diversity in the line-up.

‘In general there is a problem in Australian TV,’ Fennell said. ‘Reality TV often leads the way, if you look at MasterChef, X Factor, The Voice, those shows are really good… the big event shows people watch in general are getting a lot better… I wish they’d been able to do this on this show,’ he explained. 

Fennell said he had no problem with I’m A Celeb ‘over all’ and enjoys watching it but believes there should ‘at least be an attempt to represent the full diversity of Australia’.

‘It’s a big, fun, cheesy reality event that could do really well… I wouldn’t have put it to air without at least an attempt at some diversity,’ Fennell said. 

The 29-year-old SBS anchor admitted that the show’s producers would have had a tough time casting for I’m A Celeb. 

‘The talent they are after needs to be universally known but not busy... That’s a hard ask,’ he said.

Adding: ‘I bear no malice to the production company I just don’t think in 2015 it’s OK to put out a show that’s just white people and bears no resemblance to the diversity of Australia.’

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Channel 10 for comment. 

Stars who reportedly tuned down offers to appear on the show include former radio star Sophie Monk, who turned down a proposed $60,000 per week salary, along with beauty queen Tegan Martin, cricketer Shane Warne and former Bachelor Blake Garvey. 

I'm A Celeb achieved an impressive 1.306m viewers for its opening show and 1.199m for its Welcome to the Jungle special on Sunday.

It rated as the fourth most-watched show after the Australian Open final presentation and match on Channel 7 and Nine News's Sunday show.
