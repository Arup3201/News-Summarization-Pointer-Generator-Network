Hugo Carrasco has lived in the U.S. since he was ten years old, having entered illegally with his family, and is now married to an American with whom he has two children.

Still, he lives in fear of being deported to his native Mexico at any given time, having already suffered one close shave which nearly tore his family apart, an experience he writes about for Salon.com.

In 2011, Mr Carrasco was arrested and charged with identity theft - having 'made up' a social security number in order to gain employment - and spent 90 days in county jail while his wife was pregnant with their first child.

'After years of complicated legal issues, I live in limbo,' he says of his release from prison three years ago. 'The authorities could reopen my case and order my deportation at any time.'

Mr Carrasco's life in America begun when he was smuggled across the border from Chihuahua, Mexico - a dangerous region fraught with drug wars - to Douglas, Arizona as a ten-year-old boy, along with his siblings and mother.

He says he remembers very little about the journey but recalls his family's excitement at the prospect of being reunited with his father, a construction worker who had been working in Arizona illegally for several months.

Mr Carrasco admits that while growing up he was aware his family was 'undocumented', he didn't comprehend the full weight of that status until he reached high school.

Choices: After growing up knowing he was 'different' Mr Carrasco (pictured with Leslie) 'made up' a social security number to gain employment and was caught and sent to prison for 90 days

'I started to feel pretty bad about myself, like I wasn’t good enough, because I wasn’t like the other kids,' he says. 'I couldn’t ask a girl out on a date, because I couldn’t drive. What if she wanted to see an R-rated movie, and I didn’t have the proper ID to go?'

Regardless, Mr Carrasco tried to live as normal a life as possible, making up a fake social security number, which 'didn't belong to anyone else' he points out, in order to score a job as a bartender.

He also worked hard as a volunteer for a charity, Young Life, where he mentored 'at-risk' high school students, and where he ended up meeting his wife, Leslie.

Not long after the happy couple had saved enough money to buy their first home, the infamous Sheriff Joe Arpaio - known for his raids on restaurants to expose illegal immigrants, and for once arresting a six-year-old girl - tracked Mr Carrasco down and sent him to jail.

Worry: Due to his conviction, Mr Carrasco can't apply for citizenship via any of the usual routes, like through his marriage, and he lives in fear that he could be deported at any time

He says it was the day his 'world ended'.

With the help of a good lawyer, Mr Carrasco was released from jail in time for his son's birth and put on a 'home-monitoring program.'

'If I’m sent back to Chihuahua, my 
children won’t have their father by their side, and my wife won’t have 
the support she needs and deserves'

He has since welcomed his second child, a daughter, and is now an advocate for an immigration reform; meeting with members of Congress to share his story. He is unable to apply for citizenship through his marriage - a common route - or through the government's DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program due to his previous conviction for using falsified documents to work.

Mr Carrasco is one of an estimated 11.5 million 'unauthorized immigrants' residing in the U.S., according to the Department of Homeland Security.

Of that number, over 600,000 illegal immigrants were forcibly deported in 2102, the latest figure available, and Mr Carrasco is still terrified that he could join that statistic.

'If I’m sent back to Chihuahua, my children won’t have their father by their side, and my wife won’t have the support she needs and deserves,' he says. 'Who could ever call that justice?'
