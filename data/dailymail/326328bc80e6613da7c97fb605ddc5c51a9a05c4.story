A health and safety inspector has revealed he raised concerns about the Hillsborough stadium 12 months before the disaster but was told by his superiors to 'keep his nose out'.

Paul Jackson, who worked for Sheffield City Council’s Environmental Protection Unit, claims he had been made aware of concerns over the crush barriers, their height and spacings a year before the tragedy which killed 96 Liverpool fans.

But on April 15, 1989, one of the crash barriers gave way, crushing dozens to death in Sheffield Wednesday’s ground as Liverpool FC took on Nottingham Forest at the start of the FA Cup semi-final.

'Keep your nose out': A health and safety inspector has revealed he raised concerns about the barriers at Hillsborough in 1988 but he was told it was a 'politically sensitive' area

Today, Mr Jackson told an inquest he was ordered to turn a blind eye to the issues.

He also claimed that a number of councillors were Sheffield Wednesday fans, making it 'politically sensitive'.

'I had been told there was problems with the barriers and I had been told not to get involved with it,' he told the Warrington hearing.

He said before he went on a visit to the stadium in 1988, his line managers told him: 'Just don’t go into that area. Not to stick my nose in.

'That it was politically sensitive and that I should keep out of it.

'There had been previous concerns over them.'

Christina Lambert QC, counsel for the inquests, asked if this caused him 'disquiet'.

Mr Jackson said: 'It was sort of the approach on safety generally,' adding: 'In terms of things that happened at Sheffield City Council at the time, not terribly unusual.'

The witness said he believed 'other parts' of the council would deal with the matter and it was an 'area looked after by somebody else.'

He said he made his own visit to Hillsborough to look at the barriers.

There he saw Dr Wilfred Eastwood, the club’s engineering adviser, a man of 'strong opinions' who 'knew his own mind'.

Inquest: Mr Jackson was questioned by lawyers of the 96 victims of the tragedy as part of a hearing to uncover what happened in the run up to the disaster. Police and council workers will also give evidence

Mr Jackson added: 'I left it with the building surveyor and Dr Eastwood, who also made it clear he really did not want us there.'

Ms Lambert continued: 'But you could have no confidence that they would act on these problems with the crash barriers?'

Mr Jackson replied: 'I did not have any great confidence.'

The jury heard Mr Jackson had made a statement to West Midlands Police in 1989 and he described a 'culture that contributed to the problem' concerning the council’s approach to safety.

But when he gave the statement to police, Mr Jackson said he did not 'bring up' the matter of being told to 'keep his nose out' of the barriers problem at Hillsborough.

Former council members have been questioned as well as representatives from Sheffield Wednesday FC and South Yorkshire Police.

The hearing in Warrington continues.
