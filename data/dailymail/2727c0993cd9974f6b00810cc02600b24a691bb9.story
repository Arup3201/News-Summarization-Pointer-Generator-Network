Ahmad Rashad is no longer welcome at his home - after his soon to be ex-wife had him booted from their property that they once shared in a lavish Florida complex.

Days after reports that his marriage to former model Sale Johnson was crumbling, she has taken drastic measures to keep Rashad away, including hiring guards.

Their home, which is reportedly worth
about $5million, is on the Bears Club complex in Jupiter, a collection 
of multimillion-dollar homes that NBA legend Michael Jordan also calls 
home.

Golf superstar Tiger Woods, who has been through some marriage troubles of his own, also lives nearby.

A source told Gossip Extra that
Rashad was recently able to get through the gate when he arrived at the
home, but 'guards escorted him out' as he tried to get into the 
clubhouse.

It's the first salvo in what is believed to be an ugly divorce between the former football player and his wife.

A source told Gossip Extra: 'Sale cut 
Ahmad off from all the clubs theyâ€™re members of, and had the fob that 
gets him through the guard gate at the Bears Club deactivated.'

Crumbled: Sale Johnson is reportedly protected by a prenuptial agreement, which keeps Rashad from collecting a dime of her fortune

The exclusive gated community was founded in 1999 by legendary golfer Jack Nicklaus and his wife Barbara, and is built around a golf course.

The Post reported that the home is under Ms Johnson's name.

The marriage to Ms Johnson in 2007 was Rashad's fourth. He was previously married to Deidre Waters, Matilda Johnson and Cosby Show actress Felicia Rashad.

Johnson is the ex-wife of Johnson & Johnson heir and New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, from whom she collected $100million in their divorce, according to the New York Post.

A source told Gossip Extra that Johnson is protected by a prenuptial agreement that blocks Rashad from receiving a dime from her once the divorce is final.
