Tim Sherwood has ruled himself out of the running to become Crystal Palace's new manager.

The former Tottenham Hotspur boss was made the bookmakers' favourite to take charge at Selhurst Park after Malky Mackay was ruled out amid Sportsmail's exclusive revelations. 

But Sherwood is uninterested in filling the void left by Tony Pulis, meaning Keith Millen will remain caretaker manager for Palace's home match on Saturday against West Ham.

No go: Sherwood is said to be uninterested in the job and has confirmed he will not take over as manager

'Palace is a great club with a great tradition but in a difficult situation which was unforeseen,' Sherwood told Sky Sports presenter Jim White.

Terms got more complicated between Sherwood and Palace after the 45-year-old reportedly demanded former Spurs coaching staff Chris Ramsey and Les Ferdinand join him at Selhurst Park.

Palace co-owner Steve Parish refused to agree to the conditions and must now look elsewhere to replace Pulis, who left his post less than 48 hours before Palace's Premier League season began. 

Neil Lennon now becomes the new favourite of the bookmakers to take over. The former Celtic manager has Steve Clarke, Dermot Drummy and Martin Jol for company in the running.

Sherwood's withdrawal comes after Palace pulled the plug on appointing Mackay.

Sportsmail revealed the former Cardiff City manager and Iain Moody are under investigation by the Football Association over sexist, racist and homophobic text messages.

A Palace statement on Thursday read: 'In light of the events of yesterday (Wednesday), sporting director Iain Moody has tendered his resignation and it has been accepted with immediate effect.' 

Mackay since apologised  but caused further controversy after describing two racist text messages, which he admits he sent, as 'friendly text message banter'.

The text exchanges outlined in Sportsmail’s exclusive report date back to when Mackay and Moody worked as manager and head of recruitment at Cardiff, before both were sacked by club owner Vincent Tan amid claims of over-spending in the transfer market.

Tan launched a £750,000 investigation, conducted by law firm Mishcon de Reya. The series of deeply offensive text messages were discovered during a raid on Moody’s London home in March. 

Mackay issued a poorly-worded statement through the League Managers’ Association. ‘In the course of a search by the club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff, it emerged that Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one-line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures,’ said the statement.

‘These were two text messages sent in private at a time Malky felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter.’ 

Disgraced: Malky Mackay is being investigated by the Football Association about text messages

Shocking:  Crystal Palace's former sporting director Iain Moody is also being investigated by the FA
