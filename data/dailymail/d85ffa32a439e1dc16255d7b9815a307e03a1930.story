Italy boss Antonio Conte visited Tottenham's training ground on Monday as part of a fact finding mission on English football.

The former Juventus midfielder, who won a host of top honours including five Serie A titles, the UEFA Cup and the Champions League during a glittering 13-year spell at Juventus, stopped by at Hotspur Way as part of a series of visits he is making to Premier League clubs this week.

Conte, who is also visiting Chelsea this week, chatted at length to Mauricio Pochettino and his staff discussing the training facilities our players have at their disposal.

Conte said: 'Impressed is exactly the right word!. It looks like a very good place to work and for Tottenham Hotspur to develop their potential.

'The reason for my visit is to study and to look at some of the situations at clubs in England – especially in London. I am meeting with some managers who I think are doing well and to discover the reasons why they are doing well.'

Conte will watch Tottenham against Fiorentina and West Ham this week. He said: 'The only message I can give to the players is that they have to work every single day.

'Obviously it’s a great sensation to be at the top of Europe and I think it’s going to be a very interesting game on Thursday.

'It’s a match between two clubs who are doing very well at the moment and playing some interesting football, so it’s going to be a good game.'
