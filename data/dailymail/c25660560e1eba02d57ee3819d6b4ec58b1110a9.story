They were warned it would bring chaos to the streets of steamy Los Angeles so, unsurprisingly, thousands of people stayed at home last July.

Nine months on and it's believed California's so-called Carmageddon may have had a very different result - a baby boom.

At the time, residents were warned to stay off the roads when construction shut down the busy 405 Freeway in Los Angeles for an entire weekend.

Fear and anxiety went into overdrive as visions of 60-mile traffic jams and and apocalypse abounded.

Now doctors and maternity clinics say the birth rate in LA has skyrocketed.

Dr Joie Russo usually delivers eight to ten babies a month at Providence Medical Centre in Tarzana, which is not far from the 405.

She told CBS News: 'I've probably done about eight
deliveries in the last two weeks, so much so that I wasn't able to go 
on vacation.

'In a 30-minute period, including me, there were five 
deliveries done at once.'

At The Pump Station, where new mother go for breast-feeding tips, co-founder Corky Harvey said: 'People just stayed home and had a relaxing time. Well, relaxation and there you go.'

The 405 freeway was vacant during the demolition of the Mulholland Drive bridge across the 405 in July last year

Natasha and Brian Mills were one couple who stayed at home that day.

Brian Mills said: 'We just holed up in the house, kind of sat by the fire and hung out with each other.'

Natasha Mills added: 'And the rest, I don't have to say.'

At the moment the claim is only based on anecdotal evidence and it may turn out to another urban myth like the best-known catastrophe-related baby boom that followed the New York City blackout in 1965.

But CBS News notes this year's birth rate statistics will be available in another few weeks.
