Pakistani cricket star-turned politician Imran Khan has left hospital two weeks after he received serious back injuries in a fall from a forklift truck at a campaign event.

Mr Khan fractured three vertebrae and a rib when he fell 15 feet from a forklift truck at a campaign event in Lahore on May 7.

A spokesman for his party, Naeemul Haq, said Mr Khan was at his home in the eastern city of Lahore.

He said Mr Khan could walk and would be staying at home for a while so doctors could monitor his progress.

The accident largely knocked him out 
of the final campaigning days ahead of national elections, held on May 
11. He later delivered video messages from hospital to his supporters.

Former cricket star Imran Khan has been injured after falling 15 feet off a stage at a political rally in Pakistan.

Khan fell at least five metres - 15 feet - off what appeared to be a makeshift elevator raising him up to the stage.

Local TV footage showed supporters carrying Khan away from the rally. His face was bloody and he appeared unconscious.

Khan, now one of Pakistan's most prominent politicians, was then rushed to hospital after the incident today in Gulberg, near Ghalib market, in the eastern city of Lahore.

Dr. Mohammed Shafiq, who treated him,
said Khan received seven stitches to a six-inch long wound in the head.
He said the cut was not deep.

He
is fully conscious and he was complaining of backache. He is fine, but 
he must have some rest for one or two days,' Shafiq said in comments 
aired on Geo News.

Hundreds of people gathered outside the hospital in the eastern city of Lahore awaiting word of his condition.

At 3.46pm, his ex-wife Jemima Khan tweeted: 'He's in hospital & conscious now'.

It is understood Khan fell after a 
sudden imbalance of the wood planks on the lifter due to an increase in 
weight as his security personnel accompanied him towards the stage.

One of the leaders of Khan's party, Ijaz Chaudhry, says the politician's injuries were not life-threatening.

PTI member Imran Ismail added: 'He has been taken to Shaukat Khanum hospital. He has lost [quite] a lot of blood and since, there was no ambulance we have taken him in our private cars.'

Khan earned legendary status in the country when he led the underdog national team in the 1992 Cricket World Cup to victory.

He later joined politics but it wasn't until just a few years ago that his PTI party gained a widespread national following.

The charismatic politician had been setting a furious pace of rallies and election events across the country to drum up support for his campaign. Khan was due to address nine rallies in today alone ahead of Saturday's general election.

Few expect him to be the next prime minster, but his party could play a role as a kingmaker or form a solid opposition in parliament.

Interim Prime Minister Mir Hazar Khan Khoso expressed concern over Khan's injury and wished him a quick recovery.

Political events in Pakistan can be a chaotic affair. Often crowds press up against areas where the candidates are speaking, and safety regulations are not always strictly followed.
