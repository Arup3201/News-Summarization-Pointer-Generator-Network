A Kansas foster father was high on marijuana when he left a 10-month-old girl in a hot car, where she died, prosecutors said Friday.

Details of the case surfaced during a bond hearing for Seth M. Jackson, 29, of Wichita, who is charged with first-degree murder in the baby's July 24 death.

KWCH reported that Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett cited the marijuana use in court as the reason for raising his bond to $250,000. 

Bennett told the court Jackson had gone to his drug dealer's house and bought marijuana. 

He said prosecutors believe Jackson came home to consume marijuana, leaving the girl behind in the car.

Charged: Seth Jackson - pictured right with his 
partner Payton Schroeder (left) - has been charged with murder after forgetting 
about their 10-month-old foster child and leaving her in a hot car to 
die. Jackson was coming home to consume marijuana, the prosecution said Friday

Jackson was initially jailed on a $100,000 bond, and the defense had been trying to get the bond lowered.

Police have said Jackson had apparently forgotten about her until something on TV jogged his memory. 

The girl was left in a the sweltering car with the windows up for more than two hours outside her foster parents' home in Wichita. 

Temperatures at the time were around 90 degrees.

Jackson's defense attorney, John Stang, said earlier this week that prosecutors have gone too far in charging his client with murder and that an involuntary manslaughter charge would have better fit the case.

But Bennett has said the charge was warranted because the child died during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony — aggravated endangering of a child. No one alleges the child was intentionally left in the car.

Both sides agree the circumstances are entirely different than a widely publicized case in Georgia, where a father is charged with murder and child cruelty charges on suspicion of intentionally leaving a 22-month-old boy in a hot car last month as he went to work.

Jackson, 29, was arrested after he found the baby - known as Anna to the new family and Kadillak to her biological relatives - inside his silver Dodge Charger and called emergency services.

Baby Kadillak was being cared for by Jackson and his partner Payton Schroeder, 26, who are parents to two adopted boys, aged five and seven. They had cared for the girl for most of her life.

Jackson had collected her from daycare last Thursday but left her in the car with the windows rolled up as he went inside his home with his five-year-old son - as temperatures reached 95 degrees.

When he 
ran outside to get the girl, he found her unresponsive. Emergency 
dispatchers got a call at 6.41pm, and the girl was pronounced dead a few
 minutes later.

One of 
the foster parents was 'hysterically crying' outside the house before they were both taken in by police for questioning, witnesses said.

Jackson and his partner had been trying to adopt the 10-month-old girl they had cared for nearly all her life.

They also had three other foster children, ages three, five and 18; and had two adopted children, ages five and seven. The two younger foster children were visiting other relatives at the time.

Police have said both foster parents were distraught over what happened.

Jackson's mother Dottie told NBC that she spoke to her son at 2am Friday.

'He wants to die,' she said. 'Seth's children - that's his life.'

The little girl's biological grandmother Cindy Poe, drove to Wichita to try and discover how the tragedy had occurred.

'Accidents
 do happen. We don't know if it was accident,' she told NBC station KSN.
 'They have a lot of kids they take care of. I want answers.'

The couple's adoptive children were taken into protective custody.

A neighbor said the men were devoted parents.

'They
 are two of the most kind-hearted guys that I have ever met. And I hate 
that there's so much controversy right now with babies being left in the
 car, because I truly don't feel from the bottom of my heart they would 
ever do this on purpose,' Lindey TenEyck, who lives across the street, 
told NBC.

Both the prosecution and the defense agree the circumstances are entirely different than a widely publicized case in Georgia, where a father is charged with murder and child cruelty charges on suspicion of intentionally leaving the 22-month-old boy in a hot car last month as he went to work.

Bennett said this Kansas case is not charged as an intentional murder.

'No one is alleging, it is not charged that he did this intentionally,' Bennett said of the Kansas case.

'We are not intimating, as authorities in Georgia have, there was some plot or anything like that. It is a different charging theory and a different charging authority in Kansas than what appears to be in Georgia.'

Jackson' partner, Schroeder, has not been charged. He was already home 
when Jackson came in and assumed he'd brought the baby in, according to police reports.
