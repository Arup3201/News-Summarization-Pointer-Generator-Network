An aspiring musician from Buckinghamshire persuaded Hollywood actor Zach Braff to help him propose to his girlfriend.

Matt Hulbert, 35, and his partner Janice Fletcher, 33, are both huge fans of sitcom Scrubs which Zach stars in and Matt made it hard for his girlfriend of three years to say no by creating an incredibly romantic 
YouTube video.

Matt managed to get Zach involved after pledging an undisclosed amount for his new independent film Wish I Was Here via Kickstarter - a way of funding creative projects. In return, Matt asked if the actor would make a cameo appearance in the proposal video he was preparing.

Zach immediately agreed to help Matt and sent over his part of the video so he could start building the rest up

'Janice
had been dropping hints and I wanted to propose, so when I saw someone
posted the Kickstarter project on Facebook the idea just came to me,' 
Matt tells MailOnline.

Zach immediately agreed and sent over his part of the video so Matt could start building the rest up.

Matt secretly shared his plans with friends, family and colleagues - swearing them to secrecy from Janice. He managed to them all to film clips to go in the video - including a pair of friends who travelled around Europe.

'My friend Ed works for EasyJet and 
he had this great idea. He decided to go 
around Europe with our friend Bruno and take the Say Yes signs in different languages.

The 
four-minute film has now gone viral and has been watched more than 63,000 times.

'I cant believe how lucky I am with all my amazing friends and family.'

He had been carefully planning the gesture for their three year anniversary on Sunday, but all did not go to plan.

'I was going to propose on our three 
year anniversary, which is coming up on July 7, but it couldn't wait any
longer - I was worried I'd get found out!.

'We both took the afternoon off work so we could go for dinner and I could get her colleagues to film a clip for the video. The minute she left work I phoned up her work and got them to do the video.

'I had a bit of a panic. We don't keep anything from each other and I was worried about her seeing I'd emailed colleagues so I quickly came home and edited the video - I knew it would have to be tonight.

'I
asked her to sit at the computer, shut her eyes and trust me. I then 
set up video cameras around her, said she could open her eyes, look at 
the screen and press play.

The couple met through internet dating - the very modern way to meet The One.

'I saw her profile on match.com and thought we had a lot in common.

'We're both graphic designers, both love rock music. Plus she said she likes Guitar Hero. "Cool chick" I thought.'

'Like me, Janice is a huge 
fans of Scrubs so I knew it would blow her away,' says Matt.

The couple have every season on DVD and have watched every episode from start to finish together.

'It's like Friends - if it's on you don't switch it off.

'The thing about Scrubs is that it's funny with kind of a sweet undertone at the same time, what I hope the video is like.'

The video features an emotional Janice sat down at a computer with Matt by her side as they both watch his masterpiece.

An original song by Matt, who confesses he 'never became the rockstar that he promised',
soundtracks the piece. As Braff listens to the song he says: ‘He asked 
me to help with a little question he’d like to ask you, Janice... Whoa! 
Janice… looking hot.

‘He’d like you to please consider 
being his wife, being his bride. But before you answer, let’s see what a
few other people think you should do.’

What follows is a montage of touching video clips from the couple’s friends, family and even pets.

Janice, who is originally from East London, South Africa now lives in the UK. She wipes her eyes as she sees family and friends living in America who she hasn't seen in seven years telling her to Say Yes.

Zach summarises the video at the end with: ‘Well, that’s pretty unanimous.

¿He asked me to help with a little question he¿d like to ask you, Janice... Whoa! Janice¿ looking hot'

'Let’s be honest, you’re never going 
to score anyone else this hot, so I’d stick with her. She’s a babe, and 
we all know how great she is. Marry her. As Beyoncé says "If you liked 
it then you should have put a ring on it". Good luck.’

Janice says 'How did you do that!' before agreeing to marry Matt.

'I wanted to think of a really cool 
way to propose to my girlfriend, Janice, and this song and video is what
I came up with. I wanted to show her that not only do I love her but 
that she's loved by all our friends and family too,' writes Matt.

'This was particularly important as 
she hasn't been able to see much of her family for 7 years since she 
moved to the UK and she misses them lots.'

Family friends get in on the action holding up those three words - and even the little ones have a go
