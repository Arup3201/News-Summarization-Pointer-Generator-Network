This is the incredible moment a pilot tried to land a passenger jet while being hammered by the effects of a super typhoon.

The first EVA Air jet manages to land safely at the Taiwanese airport as the nation was gripped by the typhoon Usagi over the weekend.

Despite a few bumps the pilot manouvres the jet safely and it taxis its no doubt shaken passengers to the gate.

Battling the winds: The plane visibly sways back and forth as the pilot battles to stay in control

Bumpy ride: The plane bounces along the run way about 10 metres off the ground but the pilot seems unable to lower it any further

Terrifying: Eventually the pilot runs out of runway and is forced to pull the nose of the plane upwards to avoid a crash

But just a few minutes later a second plane attempts to come into land with much less success.

Even from a distance the plane can clearly be seen to sway and tilt from side to side in the air.

As it nears the end of the runway the nose of the plane tips downwards at an alarmingly sharp angle ans stays like that for an alarming couple of seconds before it levels out.

The plane nears the ground and bounces along 10 metres or so above the ground as the pilot battles to remain in control.

Abort: The plane is forced to take off again at a steep incline and circle to repeat the efforts to land safely

Devastation: A man rides a bike past a collapsed construction site in Shanwei City, south Chinas Guangdong Province

Flooding in the Phillipines: The enormous weather system brought heavy rains which left much of the country submerged

The plane travels all the way along the runway just metres above the ground before the pilot finally surrenders and pulls the aircraft upwards to circle away and try again.

Usagi was the most powerful typhoon of the year swept past the Philippines and Taiwan over the weekend but saved the worst of its wrath for their unfortunate neighbours in Hong Kong and China.

Typhoon Usagi had gusts exceeding 163 mph leaving on authorities across the region on tenter hooks trying to guess where exactly it would strike land.

As the storm passed 342 miles south of Taiwanese capital Taipei, the country's Central Weather Bureau said it was veering west, mostly likely sparing the country's south from the most destructive winds near its eye.

But gusts of nearly 150mph were recorded on the Taiwanese island of Lanyu, and the bureau warned that dangerous winds were buffeting the holiday resort of Kending on the Hengchun peninsula.

Wreckage: At least 25 people died on Monday after the typhoon south China's Guangdong Province where more than 3.56 million people in the province have been affected by Usagi, and 226,000 people were relocated

In the Philippines, the storm triggered landslides and power outages in parts of the north of the country, including the Batanes island group, where it made landfall early this morning.The Filipino weather bureau warned that storm surges and heavy waves could cause damage in the Batanes and other islands in the Luzon Strait before Usagi blows past the country by tonight

In Taiwan, nearly 2,500 people were evacuated from flood-prone areas and remote mountainous regions as the government deployed military personnel into potential disaster zones.The storm system has dumped more than 8in of rain along the eastern and southern coasts in a 13-hour period, with officials warning that a total rainfall of 39in could drop before the storm leaves tomorrow.

Local officials closed mountain highways blocked by landslides and suspended train services connecting the east and west coasts as power outages affected thousands of homes.

Usagi has a massive diameter of 680 miles, with its outer rain bands extending across Luzon and all of Taiwan across to the Chinese coast.
