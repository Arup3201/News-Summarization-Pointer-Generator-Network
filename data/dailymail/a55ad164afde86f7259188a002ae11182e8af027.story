Butchered: Jomali Morales was stabbed 19 times by Markeece Dunning and left for dead in a housing project elevator in lower Manhattan

A Manhattan man who admitted stabbing to death a former model in 2011 has been sentenced to life in prison.

Markeece Dunning, 22, was sentenced Thursday after pleading guilty earlier this year to first-degree murder for the horrific killing of 42-year-old Jomali Morales that left her with 19 stab wounds in her face neck and back, officials said.

Morales’ butchered body was infamously found covered in blood February 12, 2011 in the elevator of Baruch Houses, a city housing project on the Lower East Side.

Prosecutors contended during today’s sentencing that Dunning planned to rob and rape Morales as soon as he saw her in the hours before she was found dead.

The woman was later found to have been intoxicated at the time of her death, and investigators believe that impaired her judgement enough that she allowed Dunning to convince her to go to his apartment that morning instead of returning home, a source told MailOnline.

Authorities called her ‘the perfect victim.’

Dunning made a false promise to the woman, which he did not tell authorities, and she agreed to go to his home, the source said.

Morales was later found dead, and police arrested the then-19-year-old Dunning one month later.

She was tragically laid to rest on what should have been a day of celebration.

‘Because of Markeece Dunning, Jomali Morales’ family planned her funeral on the day they should have been celebrating her 43rd birthday,’ asid Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance, Jr.

‘After horrifically murdering Ms. Morales, the defendant left her to die in an elevator of the Baruch Houses,’ Vance continued. 

Her belongings were later found sifted into separate plastic bags scattered through the building, authorities said.

Sexually motivated: Dunning admitted to wanting to rape and rob Morales the minute he saw her, but instead wound up stabbing her in the face, neck and back

Where she was found: Morales' bloody, lifeless body was found in 2011 slumped over in this housing project elevator

Morales’ mother Petra Vitale told WABC shortly after the killing that ‘she was like a light that lit up the room.’

The one-time model had grown up on the Lower East Side and left the city only to return with a young daughter, her mother said.

That girl is now being raised by her grandmother. 

Dunning was only a teenager when arrested, but he had already logged 11 prior arrests for crimes ranging from drug possession and trespassing to gang assault, officials said.
