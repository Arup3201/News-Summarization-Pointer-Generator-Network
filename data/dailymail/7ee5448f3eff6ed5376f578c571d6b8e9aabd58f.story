A photographer has celebrated some of New York's most iconic landmarks in these moody portraits.

The Empire State Building, Times Square and Grand Central station are all instantly recognisable but take on a different personality when shot in black and white.

Swiss photographer Alex Teuscher took the photos while traipsing the usual tourist trails in the Big Apple.

Swiss photographer Alex Teuscher has celebrated some of New York's most iconic landmarks in these moody portraits

The hustle and bustle of Times Square has taken on an different look in these arty shots as people squeeze through the street

The 32-year-old snapper wanted to show them in a different dimension, and used a Noir palette to bathe them in an unusual light.

As the Chrysler and Empire State buildings tower above the colourless skyline they look like photos taken from a bygone era.

Alex, from Geneva, Switzerland, said: 'I spent 10 days in the city this year for business and pleasure, and all these shots were taken while following the usual Manhattan tourist trail.

'The locations along that trail are iconic for a reason and why they are photographed so much.

'I wanted to try and present them differently however, like the Chrysler and Empire state buildings in different compositions than they are usually seen in.'

The half Swiss, half American photographer battled hordes of tourists in Times Square to photograph a sea of heads as they wander around.

Alex took up photography five and a half years ago after his dad gave him his old camera and has self-taught himself.
