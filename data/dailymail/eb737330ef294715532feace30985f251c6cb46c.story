An army veteran who served in Northern Ireland and Bosnia for almost 10 years and became homeless claims he was told he is not on a council's 'priority list' because 'he doesn't have a drink or drug problem'.

Matthew Dennis, 39, has already been forced to sleep rough once and is now concerned he could end up having to sleep on the streets again.

The former Lance Corporal claims he was told by Bournemouth District Council that as he does not have a drink or drug problem he is not on their 'priority list' for accommodation so has been left homeless.

In failing to find him a home the authority also is not following the armed forces covenant, which was introduced by the Ministry of Defence, to ensure service personnel are not disadvantaged by being in the army.

Army veteran Matthew Dennis has been left homeless after he claims Bournemouth District Council said he was not on a priority list for housing in the area because he does not have a drink or drugs problem

Under the covenant authorities are required to give priority to help former service personnel find housing. Bournemouth District Council claimed this did not apply after veterans had been out of the army for five years - but the Ministry of Defence said there is no time limit on the covenant. 

Mr Dennis said: 'I do feel let down.'

'I went to the council for help. They said since I don't have any problems with drugs or alcohol, I am not a priority.'

Mr Dennis was evicted from his rented flat last week after losing his job as a kitchen fitter which he worked as since leaving the armed forces in 2000. He lost his job after the company went into liquidation. 

He is currently being put up in a bed and breakfast, at a cost of £95 a week - which is being paid for by Homes4Heroes.

David Wood, a co-ordinator for the charity said: 'Matthew spent a few days sleeping rough before coming to us. He doesn't know the benefits system. He has worked all his adult life and has served his country for nine years and this is the first time he has needed help.

'At first a guy in the housing office said there was a place available but he had to go and check with his supervisor. When he came back 10 minutes later he was told he was not a priority case as he was not vulnerable.

'There was no more assistance offered. I was disgusted.

'The Armed Forces Covenant outlines a duty of care our society owes our armed services, who have represented the country.

'Part of that duty is to ensure they are a priority for housing when they are vulnerable, as they are when they are on the streets exposed to the elements and attacks by others.'

Mr Wood said the charity only has limited resources to pay to help ex-servicemen and women with housing. 

He said he believes Bournemouth District Council should be following the Armed Forces Covenant to help the 39-year-old. 

Mr Dennis claims he was told he was not a priority for housing by Bournemouth District Council 

Bournemouth council claimed Mr Dennis was provided with advice and offered the option of applying for supported housing and refused, although he denies this, saying little useful information was provided.

Kelly Ansell, the council's senior strategic housing manager, said the homeless were assessed on a case-by-case basis.

She said: 'When specifically dealing with former HM Forces personnel our decisions take account of the military covenant and homelessness legislation which was applied in this case.

'Mr Dennis has the right to request a review of the decision made and we would be happy to re-visit the discussion on his housing options with him.'

A spokesman for the council said  the officer has considered vulnerability according to the homelessness legislation, and specifically considered whether the applicant is a ‘Vulnerable former members of the armed forces’. 

They said he would not have been told he was not considered a priority because of a drink or drug problem.
