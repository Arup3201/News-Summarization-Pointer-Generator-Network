The Penn State assistant coach placed on what the university calls 'administrative leave', has told football players in a brief conference call that his career as their coach is over.

Wide receivers coach Mike McQuery, who witnessed Jerry Sandusky raping a 10-year-old boy in the shower room in 2002 but did not intervene, according to a grand jury indictment, also stunned the students by telling them he was in 'protective custody' at a location away from campus.

The university has already banned McQuery from today's game against Nebraska at the Beaver Stadium for his own safety, but the comment appears to have been an attempt at black humour which fell on deaf ears. Some players believed him to be telling the truth, the Patriot-News reported.

McQuery's predicament emerged as a nighttime vigil to honour the victims of Sandusky's alleged sexual assaults took place outside the Old Main building of Penn State's central Pennsylvania campus.

It was an emotional scene, as students lit blue candles and joined together in songs which included the Alma Mater and their popular chant 'We Are'.

In a drastically altered atmosphere from the riots of earlier in the week, an acapella group performed a rendition of Coldplay's 'Fix You' with many students singing along to the line 'tears stream down your face', according to university paper the Daily Collegian.

Interim President Rodney Erickson, in for sacked Graham Spanier, stood on the Old Main patio during the memorial and former NFL linebacker LaVar Arrington, 33, who played for Penn State under shamed Joe Paterno before being drafted by the Washington Redskins in 2000, gave a powerful speech.

Arrington said the shocking allegations were a 'wake up call' to protect one another. 'Let's make tonight the starting point of setting the standard,' he said. 'Leave here with a resolve and an understanding that you have the power to change things.'

The vigil capped off an arduous day for Penn State, which had begun with a pledge by the board of trustees to search for the truth and an announcement that McQuery had been placed on 'administrative leave'.

'It became clear that coach McQueary 
could not function in this role under these circumstances,' Erickson 
said on Friday of the multiple threats against the coach.

The Patriot-News reported that on Friday afternoon, new receivers coach Terrell Golden gathered the players in a room at Penn State's football complex and allowed them to talk with McQueary on a speaker phone.

During a brief and emotional conversation, McQueary reportedly told them: 'I wanted to let you guys know I'm not your coach anymore. I'm done.'

According to the paper, when the players asked where he was or if they could see him, McQueary responded: 'No, I'm actually in protective custody. I'm not in State College.'

Sports Information Director Jeff Nelson later told the paper McQueary was not in protective custody and suggested the comment was an attempt at black humor that fell flat.

The players did not get the joke and were still shaken by the comment when the call ended, the Patriot-News reported.

McQueary, 37, has been a full-time coach at Penn State since 2004. He was a graduate assistant when he allegedly witnessed Sandusky sodomising a 10-year-old boy.

He has been specialising as the receivers coach and recruiting coordinator and was the Nittany Lions' starting quarterback in 1997. He is married with a two-year-old daughter.

Besides Paterno, Spanier and McQuery, others at the school have been accused of a cover-up of Sandusky's alleged sexual assaults of eight boys over a 15-year period.

Athletic director Tim Curley and vice president Gary Schultz have each been charged with perjury and failing to report an incident of abuse in 2002 to authorities. Curley has taken administrative leave, while Schultz — who was already working on an interim capacity — has returned to retirement.

Paterno has not been implicated, and prosecutors have said he is not a target of the investigation. Curley and Schultz, through their attorneys, have denied wrongdoing.

Described in court papers as distraught about witnessing the 2002 attack, separate newspaper accounts from the time indicate McQueary appeared in the months and years that followed in charity events that Sandusky also took part in, or were to benefit Sandusky's group The Second Mile.

Asked if McQueary would be fired, Erickson said 'there are complexities to that issue that I am not prepared to go into at this point.'

In forums online, and in comments on other websites, some have indeed called for McQueary to be ousted, but the assistant coach could be protected as a whistleblower.

Gerald J. Williams, a partner at a Philadelphia law firm, said Pennsylvania law is broad in protecting a person who reports wrongdoing, as long as that person is part of a governmental or quasi-governmental institution, such as Penn State.

Asked if McQueary was protected by whistleblower status, trustee Boyd Wolff said on Friday after a board meeting, 'He's a witness. He's different from the others, so he has to be treated differently.'.

According to the grand jury report, McQueary 'reported what he had seen' to Paterno the next day, and Paterno then spoke to Curley.

McQueary was also called to a separate meeting with Curley and Schultz. Schultz, in turn, notified university president Graham Spanier.

Curley and Schultz — as well as Paterno — testified they were told that Sandusky behaved inappropriately in that 2002 incident, but not to the extent of McQueary's graphic account to the grand jury.

McQueary, 28 years old at the time of the incident,  was 'distraught' after witnessing the alleged 2002 assault, according to the indictment. Yet it appears he may have continued to participate in fundraising events with Sandusky — including one held less than a month later.

Sandusky was arrested and charged last Saturday. His lawyer maintains his client is innocent.

The financial fallout from the shocking allegations that Penn State instigated a cover-up of prolonged the sexual abuse has begun in earnest with sponsors pulling out of the university.

Online automobile shopping company Cars.com has withdrawn its television sponsorship of Penn State's football game against Nebraska at Beaver Stadium today, while paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams has removed its name and logo from the banner which serves as a backdrop to all press conferences on campus.
