Low ratings: Paul Hollywood's attempt to break into the lucrative U.S. TV business is on the rocks after his American Baking Competition flopped

Paul Hollywood’s attempts to conquer America appear to have fallen flat.

The star baker had hoped to replicate the success of The Great British Bake Off with a U.S. version of the show.

But The American Baking Competition, which was disliked by critics, attracted just 5.8million fans at its height, losing its time slot. Just 4.6million tuned in to the finale.

As a result bosses at the CBS network have not committed to a second series.

It is believed Hollywood, 47, had hoped to return to the US in the autumn for another run of the show to spend more time with 34-year-old Mexican pastry chef Marcela Valladolid.

But a TV insider said speculation over their relationship and the breakdown of his 15-year marriage to wife Alexandra, 49, with whom he has an 11-year-old son, had not helped matters.

'Hollywood’s chances of becoming a star are on the rocks. He has not made an impression like Gordon Ramsay or Simon Cowell did in their first show,' the source said.

'The American Bake Off was not liked by critics and also the viewers tuned out at the end, which has made CBS bosses non-plussed about its future.

'They hoped that the show would become a flagship for the channel with Hollywood doing for them what Gordon Ramsay does for the rival Fox network.

'But with the marriage split, the PR drive for the show went askew and both Marcela and Hollywood stayed away from a heavy publicity drive.

'It certainly hurt the show and now they might duck PR again if it gets a second chance, which doesn’t help their cause.'

At the weekend Mr Hollywood’s tearful wife told the Daily Mail there was no hope of a reconciliation and that she was divorcing him.

Mr Hollywood moved out of his Kent marital home in May amid rumours he had started dating Miss Valladolid. The news created a string of negative headlines and days before The American Baking Competition launched in the US.

Mr Hollywood and Miss Valladolid have never spoken about their relationship but a few weeks ago the baker tweeted a picture of an empty plate having apparently enjoyed a romantic dinner date with the mother-of-one, who has also split from her husband Fausto Gallardo.

He added the caption: ‘Great meal. Ahhh x’

Hours later, his  wife posted a message to more than 2,000 followers, saying: ‘I have to say, if I went out on a romantic evening I’d be gazing lovingly at my date, not tweeting my empty plate... What do you think girls?’

Valladolid attracted just 5.8million fans at its 
height, losing its time slot. Just 4.6million tuned in to the finale

Although she tweets under the name ‘Hollywood wife’, the mother-of-one has changed her Twitter profile to say that she is ‘soon to belong to The First Wives Club’.

Last night a CBS senior figure confirmed: 'No decision has been made on whether there will be additional series.

'No-one has been talking about the ratings.'
