Acknowledging the uncertainty that lies ahead, President Barack Obama said Thursday that the U.S. will cooperate with Mexico in fighting drug-trafficking and organized crime in any way Mexico's government deems appropriate.

He recommitted the U.S. to fighting the demand for illegal drugs and the flow of illegal guns across the border with Mexico even as the southern neighbor rethinks how much access it gives to U.S. security agencies.

'I agreed to continue our close cooperation on security, even as the nature of that cooperation will evolve,' Obama said at a joint news conference with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. 'It is obviously up to the Mexican people to determine their security structures and how it engages with other nations — including the United States.'

Obama's remarks come as Pina Nieto, in
a dramatic shift from his predecessor, has moved to end the widespread 
access that U.S. security agencies have had in Mexico to help fight 
drug-trafficking and organized crime.

The White House has been cautious 
in its public response to the changes, with the president and his 
advisers saying they need to hear directly from the Mexican leader 
before making a judgment about the new arrangement.

Pina Nieto, speaking at the news 
conference in Spanish, downplayed the notion that the new arrangement 
would mean less close cooperation with the United States.

'There is no 
clash between these two goals,' he said.

He said Obama had said the U.S. will 'cooperate on the basis of mutual respect' to promote an efficient security strategy.

The two leaders met Thursday at Mexico's National Palace on the first day of Obama's three-day trip to Mexico and Costa Rica.

To sell his immigration overhaul back
home, Obama needs a growing economy in Mexico and a Mexican president 
willing to help him secure the border.

He arrived in Mexico City eager to promote Mexico's economic success and the neighboring country's
place as the second largest export market for U.S. goods and services.

Mexicans will be hanging on the American president's words, but Obama also has in mind an important audience back in the United States. 

Though the role played by Latino voters in last year's U.S. presidential election gets much credit for the current momentum for potentially changing immigration laws and providing a path to citizenship for 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally, another reason for the change in attitudes is that stronger border protections and the recession have been disincentives to cross into the U.S.

As a result, illegal immigration has declined.

'With Mexico, first and foremost, 
they are critical to our ability to secure the border,' said Ben Rhodes,
an Obama deputy national security adviser.

'All
the immigration plans that have been contemplated put a focus on 
securing the border as an essential priority and starting point for 
immigration reform.'

Even better than a strong border is an economy that keeps people from fleeing.

'If
the Mexican economy is growing, it forestalls the need for people to 
migrate to the United States to find work,' Rhodes added.

Eager to focus on the economy and immigration, the administration is downplaying Pena Nieto's recent steps to end the broad access Mexico gave U.S. security agencies to help fight drug trafficking and organized crime under his predecessor, Felipe Calderon.

Still, the changes are likely to be a subject during the two leaders' private talks. Pena Nieto took office in December, and for Obama the trip is an opportunity to take his measure of the Mexican leader early in his tenure. 

'It's really important to go there 
while this new president is forming his own plans and judgments about 
what he's going to do about the border, about where he's going to be on 
immigration, about where he is on trade,' U.S. Chamber of Commerce 
President/CEO Thomas Donohue said in an interview.

The
chamber long has worked to improve U.S.-Mexico trade, noting that now 
about 6 million U.S. jobs depend on commerce with Mexico.

Striking the right note on border security is key, Donohue said, because it is a central to winning support in Congress for the rest of the immigration legislation.

'That's what everybody wants to hear, and we have to do that in a way that makes these guys down there feel like we're doing it in conjunction with them and for them, so we can do this thing on immigration well, so we can expand our trade, so we can deal with our political issues as they are trying to deal with theirs,' Donohue said.

Still, with 33 million U.S. residents of Mexican origin, Obama's message in Mexico is also bound to resonate in the U.S., where Latinos could increase pressure on Congress to act.

'It helps keep these passions alive as far as an issue to promote for the administration,' said Carl Meacham, a former senior Latin America adviser on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

But Meacham, now director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, cautioned that despite some bipartisan support to create a path to citizenship in the immigration bill, there is skepticism in Latin America. 'They've been brought to the altar so many times by different American administrations that there's a little bit of a lack of trust,' he said.

For Pena Nieto, Obama's visit is a chance for him to showcase his country's economic gains.

After suffering along with the U.S. during the recession, its economy is now growing at a better clip than that of the U.S. Per capita income has gone from an annual $7,900 two years ago to $10,146.
