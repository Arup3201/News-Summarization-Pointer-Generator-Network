Prince Charles received a prestigious conservation award at a gala dinner in Washington, DC, last night as he and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, continued their U.S. tour.

Camilla, wearing an opulent pearl necklace, and the Prince of Wales were guests of honor at the International Conservation Caucus Foundation Gala at the Andrew Mellon Auditorium.

Earlier in the day Prince Charles had tried a piece of cake at an adult education project in Washington DC.

'A bit of orange in it. Makes a whole difference,' he said.

Camilla listened attentively as Charles addressed guests on their last night in the U.S.

At the gala dinner Prince Charles was awarded the ICCF Teddy Roosevelt Award for Exceptional Leadership in Conservation before offering his own pearls of wisdom from the stage. 

The gala is billed as the most important annual conservation gathering of U.S. members of Congress, foreign heads of state, ambassadors, corporate executives, conservation legends, celebrities, and NGO and civil society leaders to celebrate conservation successes.

Addressing the gala dinner, Charles praised the United States for its long term commitment to the environment, citing President Franklin Roosevelt who sought to protect the nation's wildlife and open spaces. 

He said: 'The world has looked to the United States for leadership in so many challenging circumstances in the past.

'However, today we are faced by truly exceptional challenges and threats - a veritable "perfect storm" which, if not met by strong, decisive and far-sighted leadership, could overwhelm our capacity to rectify the damage and thereby destroy our grandchildren's future inheritance.' 

He listed his areas of concern from the continuing destruction of rainforests, to the threat to endangered animals like rhinos, elephants and tigers and the need for sustainable cities.

The prince told the invited guests: 'I repeatedly hear it said - as I am sure you do - that looking after nature is too costly; a barrier to growth and a danger to economic competitiveness.

'So long as this perspective prevails, then I fear the destruction of natural systems will be seen as in some way rational and an unavoidable price of progress.' 

Today Charles and Camilla will proceed to Louisville, Kentucky, for the final stop on their trip.

They will attend a cultural festival hosted by the Governor of Kentucky and Mayor of Louisville at the Kentucky Center for African American Heritage Center.

Camilla will visit Neighborhood House, a community center serving Portland, one of Louisville’s oldest and most diverse, but also most impoverished communities.

Prince Charles is seen making his way to a meeting with with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, at the US Capitol in Washington, D.C. yesterday

She will also attend a reception for patrons and supporters of The Brooke USA at Churchill Downs. 

The Brooke is an international animal welfare organisation dedicated to improving the lives of working horses, donkeys and mules in some of the world's poorest communities. 

They will then return to the U.K. in the evening.

Earlier yesterday President Obama told Prince Charles that Americans like the British Royal family more than their own politicians in a meeting at the White House.

A slightly awkward Prince Charles responded, 'I don't believe that,' before pausing and then quickly moving the topic on to his visit the previous day to Mount Vernon, the home of America's first president, George Washington. 

The two men last talked face to face almost four years ago when Charles flew to America a few days after the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

This time he was joined by his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, and Vice President Joe Biden made an appearance.

The Prince and the President sat together while Camilla and Mr Biden sat nearby, opposite each other on sofas. 

President Obama joked this afternoon that Americans like the British Royal family more than their own politicians in a meeting with Prince Charles at the White House

The pair met in the Oval Office for the second time since Obama took office. Vice President Joe Biden was also present 

Dozens of photographers, journalists and cameramen had been allowed into the room and the Prince looked around as camera shutters went off and boom microphones were pushed towards them.

Charles looked a little bemused but he pointed out one of the British press corps out to the President - a veteran royal photograher from the British tabloid newspaper, the Sun.

He told Mr Obama he had been photographing the Prince for more than 35 years and when he added that the first president he had reported on in the US was Ronald Reagan, the American leader replied 'Awesome'. 

Obama is the sixth American president to entertain the Royal, who has visited the US on 23 separate occasions, during his royal career and is unlikely to be the last.  

Earlier in the day the Prince of Wales paid a visit to the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Washington D.C to meet veterans.

His wife Camilla looked on admiringly as Charles tried his hand at bowling but gave it a miss herself. 

The couple had begun their day by visiting President Abraham Lincoln's cottage and were met by Erin Carlson Mast who is in charge of maintaining the property.

Mrs Mast also had presents to dispense: a book entitled Lincoln's Sanctuary for Charles and another called What Do You Do With An Idea for his grandson, Prince George.

Afterwards, the royal couple were ushered to the Armed Forces Retirement Home and were whisked into the Scott Building which houses many of the residents.
