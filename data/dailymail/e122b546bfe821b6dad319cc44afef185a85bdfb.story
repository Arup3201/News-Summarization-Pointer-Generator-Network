When new mother Melissa Lawson noticed bruises on her legs and constant back ache, she put the symptoms down to her recent pregnancy.

The 19-year-old had no reason to suspect it was a sign of something more sinister.

But after visiting her doctor, the mother-of-one was immediately referred to hospital where tests revealed she was actually suffering chronic myeloid leukaemia.  

Melissa Lawson, 19, blamed her bruised legs and back pain last April on her recent pregnancy - shortly after giving birth to her son Michael, now 16 months, pictured

Ms Lawson, a full-time mother, said: 'In April last year I was getting stomach pains and coming out in bruises, but couldn't explain what was causing it.'

Eventually, she put the bruises on her leg down to her new son Michael gently pinching her skin. 

She added: 'I had back ache quite early on, but my mum said she had back ache for about a year after having my brother, so that's what I put it down to. 

'But one day I felt so sick, had a headache and my stomach was really swollen. I had big, lumpy bruises too. Mum said "something is not right".'

After doctors diagnosed Miss Lawson's cancer, they kept her in at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital for two nights, while deciding the best course of medication.

She said: 'I didn't know anything about leukaemia so I wasn't look for the signs because I didn't know what they were.

'Even when I was getting bruises I had put it down to the baby. I think a lot of people won't be sure what it is so I want to raise awareness so other people know what to look out for.  

'It was hard on my partner, Mike. He is a car valet and had to take unpaid time off work to look after our baby. That was quite a hard time. 

The mother-of-one visited her doctor, who immediately referred her to hospital where tests revealed Miss Lawson was in fact suffering chronic myeloid leukaemia

Miss Lawson, who says she will one day have a brother or sister for baby Michael, is raising awareness of the disease, having not been aware of the symptoms before she was struck by the blood cancer

Leukaemia is a cancer of the blood forming system in the body.

It originates in the bone marrow - the soft inner part of your bones. In leukaemia, abnormal white blood cells are made in the bone marrow.

White blood cells usually circulate around the body in the blood stream and protect the body from infection. But in leukaemia the cells do not work and do not fight infections.

Around one in four people with chronic myeloid leukaemia will have no symptoms when they are diagnosed. 

But other patients will suffer:

'When Mike had to go back into work my mum and dad were able to step in and help out. My family have all been brilliant.' 

When she is ready, Miss Lawson said she hopes to have another child. Michael is now 16 months old.

She said: 'Professor Clark at the Royal said it's not impossible for me to have children again.

'This may be feasible once the leukaemia has been successfully treated for another year or two.

'I'm grateful I've got Michael and he's healthy but it would be nice to have a brother or sister for him.'

Prof essor Clark, a consultant haematologist, said: 'Symptoms of leukaemias are often vague 'everyday' complaints such as tiredness, aches and pains or maybe recurrent infections, that don't go away with simple measures. 

'There may even be no symptoms, as they are sometimes diagnosed on a blood test in an unrelated routine check-up.

'It is always worth seeking medical advice if you have easy bruising, as with Melissa. 

'A simple blood test via the GP is all that is needed to rule out a leukaemia or similar blood disorder.'
