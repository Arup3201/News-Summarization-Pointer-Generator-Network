A British woman sentenced to three months in a Dubai jail after being found guilty of having drunken sex in the back of a taxi has said it is not fair she has had 'to rot' in the country 'for something I didn't do'.

Rebecca Blake, who turns 30 today, finds out tomorrow whether she will go to jail or be deported after appealing her initial sentence.

She is currently on bail along with Irishman Conor McRedmond, with whom she was caught.

Convicted: Rebecca Blake was sentenced to three months in jail after being found guilty of having sex in the taxi, but was bailed until the outcome of the appeal

He was also convicted, received the same sentence, despite DNA tests to find evidence of intercourse coming back negative, and has appealed along with Blake.

Speaking to ITV Daybreak, she said she was finding it hard to prepare herself for what will happen if the appeal does not go her way.

She said: 'Unfortunately I’m in a situation where I’ve got these allegations against me and I didn’t do it so I don’t think it’s fair that I’ve had to rot over here with no form of income, no medical insurance for something I didn’t do.'

The recruitment consultant, from Dorking in Surrey, was arrested on May 4 after meeting McRedmond just hours earlier.

Their taxi driver alerted police after allegedly spotting her in his rearview mirror with her top off, straddling McRedmond and ‘making the sounds of a woman having sex’.

Blake, who moved to Dubai in September last year to take up a £100,000-a-year-post at Manpower recruitment firm, had been at a drink-all-you-like £35-a-head brunch in the Rotana Hotel.

She told Daybreak she had been at the brunch with McRedmond, who she 'kind of knew', before the pair got into a taxi where they got into a heated row with the driver.

She said: 'Next thing I know he has pulled up in front of a police patrol car, gets out the taxi and talks to the policeman.'

She went on to say at that point she was not scared as she thought it was just an argument.

But she said: 'Next thing I know he gets in the taxi and drives us to the police station.

'Yeah it wasn’t nice because then it dawns on you "wow you know I’m in the Middle East, I’m in trouble", it was about midnight or one in the morning by the time I’d had my breathalyser and everything. 

'I just thought I’d wake up in the morning and hopefully I’d get to go home.'

Embarrassing: Rebecca Blake has said how difficult it has been to tell her parents of the charges

Blake said she did not know why the taxi driver would lie, although she added she had been told by her lawyer incidents like this were common, but her case had received the attention as she was from the UK.

She went on to say how difficult it had been to tell her parents of the charges.

She said: 'It’s not nice to have your daughter accused of those things and it’s also embarrassing for them.

'Obviously they’ve got to read it in the papers, when my dad goes to his local pub for example everyone sort of stops talking and makes him feel uncomfortable.

'It’s been really hard for them as well.'

During the hearing Pakistani taxi driver Qaiser Khan, 29, told the court in a statement the couple seemed confused and McRedmond swigged from a bottle.

He said: ‘I told him it was not allowed to have alcohol inside the taxi.

‘The next thing, I looked in the mirror and saw the woman sitting on the man’s thighs. She was naked, moving up and down and making sounds.’

Mr Khan said he pulled over, spotted a police patrol and called over Emirati officer Abdullah Obaid Khamis, 22, who said he found the pair still having sex.

Mr Khamis said: ‘The man’s shirt was open, his trousers were down to his knees and the woman was not wearing any underwear.’

The taxi driver claimed Blake offered him ‘a lot of money’ to tell prosecutors the pair were kissing rather than having sex but he refused.

The couple’s defence lawyer said there were gaping inconsistencies in the witness accounts.

He also said the pair could not have been having sex because Blake was on her period at the time, adding: ‘This is Dubai, not a mosque. Everyone drinks.’

Neither witness gave evidence in the trial. Their statements were instead submitted to judges in the misdemeanours court. 

Blake and McRedmond denied having consensual sex and indecency. They previously pleaded guilty to consuming alcohol and were fined £512.
