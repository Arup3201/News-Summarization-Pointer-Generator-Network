Ever dreamed of helming a Viking ship?

All aspiring Høvedsmann (captains) take note: the Lofotr Viking Museum in Northern Norway's Lofoten archipelago is looking for candidates for the upcoming summer season. 

Of the two Viking ships at the museum, Lofotr is a full-scale reconstruction of the Gokstad ship, which dates back to the 800s.

For those who've dreamed of helming a Viking ship, the Lofotr Museum in Norway is now taking candidates

Like the original, Lofotr is a celebrated seagoing ship, which has won several regattas.

The Viking museum is located on the Vestvågøy island.

To be considered for the once in a lifetime opportunity, candidates must apply.

While all qualifications must be met, interestingly, there is no requirement to speak Norwegian.

However, you must be able to speak two languages, including English or Norwegian.

The museum, on the Lofoten archipelago (pictured), requires two captains for the summer 2015 season

The Høvedsmann is responsible for preparing and carrying out daily rowing trips with a Viking ship for all guests. 

'It is an advantage if you have experience using a square sail or a boating license,' the job posting, which has been translated to English, reads.
