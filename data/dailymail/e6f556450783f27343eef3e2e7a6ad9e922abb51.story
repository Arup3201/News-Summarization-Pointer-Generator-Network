The draw of Britain as a magnet for migrants from across Europe gathered strength last year, official  figures showed yesterday.

Numbers of EU citizens coming to take jobs in this country went up – even though Germany and other major economies opened their doors for the first time to workers from Poland and Eastern Europe.

And nearly one in four of all the international migrants who found work in European countries came to take jobs here, nearly  double the numbers of immigrants who went to work in Germany, the analysis found.

It is estimated that more than 700,000 people from Romania could try to find work and settle in Britain

The count carried out by the EU statistics arm Eurostat is powerful evidence of Britain’s continuing status as the preferred destination for workers from elsewhere in Europe and from around the world.

It adds further weight to the argument that Romanian and Bulgarian workers will put Britain top of their list of potential destinations when labour market restrictions that prevent them taking jobs here are lifted at the beginning of next year.

At the weekend the Romanian think-tank Ires projected that a quarter of the country’s population of young workers aged between 18 and 35 would pick a job in this country when the barriers are removed.

The estimate means that more than 700,000 people from the country could try to find work and settle in Britain.

The wave of migration from Poland and seven other Eastern European countries which joined the EU in 2004 has brought more than a million of their citizens to Britain.

According to the new count from Luxembourg-based Eurostat, which is based on national labour force surveys, slightly over 216,000 EU citizens working in Britain in 2012 said they had arrived over the previous two years, an increase of over 10 per cent on 2010 levels.

Around half of these workers are likely to have come from Eastern Europe.

Their numbers now look certain to have been greater than numbers of Eastern European  citizens who took the opportunity to work in Germany after Berlin opened its labour market to people from Poland and the other Eastern European EU members in May 2011.

Numbers of EU workers moving into Germany doubled to 166,500 over the two years prior to 2012, going up from 80,500 recorded in a similar count in 2010.

The figures suggested that the end of restrictions on Eastern European labour brought in around 80,000 new workers.

Sir Andrew Green of the Migrationwatch think tank said: ‘What these figures say is that over the past two years nearly twice as many foreign workers came to Britain than to Germany.

‘This is despite Germany’s opening of its labour market to Eastern Europeans in May 2011 and despite the lower growth in the British economy. This is a further pointer towards a significant inflow of Romanian and Bulgarian workers into Britain next year.’

The increase in numbers of European workers in Britain came at a time when Coalition immigration curbs were first beginning to take effect. This meant the numbers of workers who said they had come to this country from outside Europe, and who do not benefit from EU freedom of movement rules, fell slightly, from 184,000 to 183,000.

EU countries worst hit by the eurozone crisis, such as Spain and Ireland, showed major falls in numbers of immigrant workers.

The Eurostat figures also showed that workers from other EU countries are less likely to be unemployed in Britain than native  British workers.
