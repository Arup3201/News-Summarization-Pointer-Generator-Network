Mauricio Pochettino insisted he would not grant Harry Kane a Premier League start simply because he is a favourite with supporters.

The Spurs manager said striker Kane is a 'special player' in the eyes of supporters because he is English and came through the club's academy. But he will be basing his decision on performances rather than sentiment when making his team selection.

'I understand the fans want him to play because he is English,' said Pochettino, 'But my decision is always about my analysis on the training and afterwards to give the balance to the team and our performance.

'If we were in Argentina and he was Argentinian player and playing with two foreign strikers, it would always be a sensitive situation.

'He is English, he is young and from the Tottenham academy so it is expected (that fans want to see him play).'

Kane is Spurs' top striker in all competitions this season, with eight goals including the second in the League Cup win over Brighton this week. But he is yet to get a place in Pochettino's starting XI in the Premier League, despite Emmanuel Adebayor and Roberto Soldado failing to deliver, with just two goals apiece.

Kane, who was born in Walthamstow, just a 15 minute drive from White Hart Lane, has proved popular with fans, many of whom believe he should be rewarded for his rich vein of form. Spurs have scored only 11 goals in 11 Premier League games, the worst of any team in the top half of the table. But Pochettino said Kane could learn from the full international players in the team.

'Roberto and Ade have a lot of experience and I think the energy Harry brings to the squad is important – it is good for him to learn from Soldado and Adebyaor.'
