After half an hour, Jonas Gutierrez gave chase to a teenage winger, hunting him down before sliding in the rain and hooking the ball from his young opponent.

It drew the biggest cheer of an uplifting afternoon. For while he may have gained a little weight and lost a little pace, his fighting spirit is stronger than ever.

It was the same spirit which proved the inspiration in his battle with testicular cancer. Twice Gutierrez has fought the illness. Twice he has won.

Jonas Gutierrez discovered that he had cancer after a challenge with Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna in May this year.

He revealed that he was receiving treatment for the disease in September, before announcing that he had been given the all-clear in early November.

The 31-year-old ran the Buenos Aries marathon in October to raise money for Argentine cancer charity FUCA (Foundation for Research, Teaching and Cancer Prevention).

On Monday, after more than a year away from a football pitch, he returned.

Nearly 1,000 well-wishers – including Newcastle skipper Fabricio Coloccini and Sunderland boss Gus Poyet, whose son Diego was playing for West Ham - were at Whitley Park to see the 31-year-old lead out United’s under-21 side.

And Gutierrez, who underwent chemotherapy earlier this year, says he is stronger for the experience, targeting a return to Alan Pardew’s senior side.

‘I really enjoyed being back in my first game after all of my treatment,’ he said.

‘It was a hard time but now I’m happy to be back to train with the lads and play for the Under-21s to get fit and play for the first-team if I can.

‘When you have a problem like cancer, other problems are really, really small.

‘The most important thing is that I won that game, that battle, which was really, really hard. I don’t know what is going to happen in the future. I can only think about the present and to try to my best.

‘It has made me stronger. I am proud to be back. I thank all the fans who have helped me through my illness.

‘Since my problem they have been with me all of the time, sending me messages. I have to say thank you for all of that support.’

Newcastle reserve-team boss Peter Beardsley kept Gutierrez on the field until three minutes from the end, affording him a standing ovation and ensuring he had helped to see home a 4-1 victory.

Beardsley admits it was an emotional day.

‘It was an honour to be part of his first game back,’ he said.

‘I made him captain and, it sounds stupid, but he said thank you when I gave him the armband.

‘He's a perfect example to the young lads. He has played in the World Cup and is different class. It's great for him to be here.

‘He's brilliant with the lads, brilliant on and off the pitch and a great personality. The reaction of the crowd was brilliant and they were all here for him. He got a great response from them at the end.

‘It's the manager's call when he plays again (for the first-team), but I would be delighted to have him with us for ever.’

Fellow Argentine Coloccini watched from the touchline with his own family and Gutierrez’s father.

And Gutierrez said: ‘Colo is like part of my family. We have had a lot of years in Newcastle together. He always knew about my situation and he gave me a lot of support. It is something really special that I have with Fabricio and our families.’

On Monday, Gutierrez was welcomed back into his footballing family.

Gutierrez last played a senior match in April this year during a loan spell with Norwich City
