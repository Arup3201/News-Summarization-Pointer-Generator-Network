The coy residents of a small Japanese town have been so shocked by a replica of Michelangelo’s Renaissance sculpture of a naked David that they have called for it to be fitted out in underpants.

The 16ft replica of the classic sculpture has been put up in a park in Okuizumo where, standing on a plinth, it towers over everyone visiting the area to use the nearby running track, baseball stadium and tennis courts.

It is also close to a children’s play area, which is of added concern to residents who have objected to the statue’s nudity.

The 16ft replica of the masterpiece in Okuizumo town government has caused a stir among residents who say its 'nakedness' is scaring children and it should wear underpants

‘It’s frightening the children and worrying the adults with its nakedness’ said a town official. ‘Several people have asked us to cover it up with underpants.’

The statue, along with a replica of Greek treasure the ‘topless’ Venus de Milo, was presented to the town by a businessman who comes from the area.

Both statues were erected in a prominent position in the park and while many residents have appreciated the gift, some have admitted they are worried about the blatant nakedness on display.

‘Some people have told the town’s legislators that toddlers are afraid of the statues because they are so big and they appeared unexpectedly over the summer,’ said Mr Yoji Morinaga, a town official.

‘They are statues of unclothed humans, and such pieces of art work are very rare in our area.

‘Some people apparently said the statues might not be good for their children.

'It’s the first time we have had anything like this in our town. Perhaps people were perplexed.’

Town official Yoki Morinaga says art featuring 'unclothed humans' such as Michelangelo's David, left, and ancient statue Venus de Milo, right, is rare in Japan

And while many locals who live in the mountainside town of fewer than 15,000 residents have welcomed the new cultural additions, some have asked for David to be fitted out with underwear ‘to preserve modesty’, said the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper.

Local officials said they hoped that 
residents would in time come to appreciate the value of the sculptures, 
which could be useful in school art classes and even be a sightseeing 
attraction.

Nudity is a questionable subject in Japan.

Earlier
 this week Singaporean photographer Leslie Kee, who lives in Tokyo, was 
arrested for selling books containing photos of male genitals.

The
 41-year-old photographer’s subjects have included Lady Gaga and 
Beyonce, but authorities have decided that – despite what the Western 
world might think -  male nudity is a far cry from pop stars and if he 
is convicted of obscenity he could be jailed for up to two years.

Under
 local laws, genitals must be obscured in books, magazines and the 
internet, a process usually carried out through pixellation.
