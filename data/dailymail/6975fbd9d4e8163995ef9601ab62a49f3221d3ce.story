A woman who lost her leg after the Boston Marathon bombing has begun training to run the event this year, declaring that it’s ‘my way of showing everyone that they didn’t destroy me’.

Rebekah DiMartino, 27, had her left limb amputated in November after 17 operations and 19 months of physio failed to get her back on her feet.

In December the mother-of-one from Katy, Texas, shared a video on Facebook of her first steps – and now she’s spending two-and-a-half hours in the gym every day and an hour in rehab in preparation for the April marathon.

DiMartino said that taking part in the Boston Marathon was 'my way of showing everyone that they didn't destroy me, and I've come back stronger because of it'

She told Espn: ‘I've never been a runner. I actually tried to run a half marathon a few years ago before this and I hated every minute of it. I didn't understand why people would run, especially for fun. But the marathon is a huge part of my life now, and it will always be.

‘I got blown up and they tried to destroy me. This is my way of showing everyone that they didn't destroy me, and I've come back stronger because of it.’

Ms DiMartino was with her son Noah, now seven, and then-boyfriend, Pete DiMartino, at the finish line of the Boston Marathon in April 2013 when two bombs detonated, killing three people and injuring 270.

All three were wounded in the blast but Rebekah suffered the most extensive damage to her left leg.

She had undergone 17 operations, including putting metal plates, screws and rods in her leg, and suffered a serious bone infection.

Although she had been confined to bedrest or a wheelchair for much of the time since the bombings, she was able to walk down the aisle on crutches when she married Pete last year.

Still, even a boot has not helped her gain strength or ease the pain in the leg, and before the operation, she said that finally losing it will be 'such a relief'.

'The day that I made the decision to chop it off is the best thing I have ever done for myself, because I was letting go of what was holding me back,' she told KHOU in December.

'You don't realize how many little blessings are in your life that you don't really even pay attention to because they're just expected.'

Sharing the video of her first steps on Facebook, Ms DiMartino wrote: 'So look what I did today... Happy New Year!!! 2014 has GOT TO GO!!!!!'

Her mother embroidered a special pink and black prosthetic leg that reads 'blessed', ready for April's marathon.

And her son Noah said he is 'just excited that she gets to run races with me and play with me now'.

Ms DiMartino added that she will not be paying any attention to the  trial of bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as she works to rebuild her life.

'It doesn't matter what happens, it's not my judgment to make and it also doesn't change anything that's happened to me.'
