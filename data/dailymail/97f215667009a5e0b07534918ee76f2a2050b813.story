FIFA are diseased and corrupt. These monsters always get away with it... 

Two whistleblowers who gave extensive evidence to FIFA's corruption probe into bidding for 2018 and 2022 World Cups have hit back at the whitewash findings presented last week - and reveal their anger at how the report portrays them.

The two former bid insiders, Bonita Mersiades from Australia 2022 and Phaedra Almajid from Qatar 2022, exclusively tell The Mail on Sunday about being branded unreliable - despite their information being apparently largely accepted by lawyer Michael Garcia, who undertook the probe. 

The Mail on Sunday can reveal that campaigning MP Damian Collins has invited both women to Parliament to share their experience and has invited them to help him arrange a FIFA reform conference in Brussels in January. They have accepted.

 'Both Bonita Mersiades and Phaedra Almajid are strong, credible women who have had the guts and determination to stand up for what they believe is right,' Collins said.

 'People have tried to smear them and discredit them. But they are knowledgeable people and they need to be heard. FIFA clearly does not want to listen.' 

Almajid reveals for the first time how she felt pressured into retracting previous accusations about the Qatar bid for fear of losing her home and her family life being destroyed.

 'When it comes to FIFA, be prepared to be crucified, not once or twice but over and over again,' Almajid says. 

'Be prepared to suffer and pay for your actions. Be prepared never to feel safe and never to feel you can trust anyone. But most importantly, be ready to be betrayed by those who have promised to protect you.' 

Mersiades says that the summary of Garcia's findings as presented by FIFA's ethics judge, Hans-Joachim Eckert, last week is a 'deliberate denigration of two women who have been courageous enough to say something.'
