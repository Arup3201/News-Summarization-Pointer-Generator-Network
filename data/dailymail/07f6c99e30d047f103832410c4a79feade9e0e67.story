Thibaut Courtois has been ruled out of Chelsea's clash with Hull, paving the way for Petr Cech to make his first Premier League start of the season.

Manager Jose Mourinho confirmed today Courtois has picked up a minor injury that will force him to miss the visit of Steve Bruce's side.

Cech – who was dislodged by Courtois as Mourinho's number one keeper – has played just 66 minutes in the Premier League this season when he replaced the Belgian during October's victory over Arsenal.

But the Czech international has featured in the Capital One Cup and Champions League and Mourinho – who ruled out a return for Fernando Torres from his two-season loan stay at AC Milan – insists the switch will not weaken his side.

Mourinho said: 'Courtois had a little problem in training, a muscular problem, and is not available for tomorrow.

'But it's a chance for Petr and a chance for Mark Schwarzer to be on the bench. So I'm more than comfortable. It's a minor problem.'

But Mourinho insists Cech has nothing to prove, and remains convinced the keeper will remain at Stamford Bridge beyond next month's transfer window.

The manager said: 'He doesn't need to prove anything to me, the club, to his team-mates, to supporters. He has absolutely nothing to prove.

'It's just an easy simple situation for him: go and play, which is what he wants to do and has done throughout his career.

'It's very comfortable for me, the players and the fans to know that our goalkeeper tomorrow is Petr Cech. It's his natural habitat to be in goal and not on the bench. So we are all comfortable with it.

'That's why, since the beginning of the season, it's perfect for me to have Petr in the squad.'

Cech has been linked with a move away after losing his starting spot but the manager added: 'I don't think it's possible (for him to leave) and I read his agent saying there's no chance of leaving Chelsea in January.

'That, plus the fact that I have no information about any offer to him, makes me believe 100 per cent that he's staying. I repeat: I'm so happy that we have this fantastic situation with the goalkeepers.'
