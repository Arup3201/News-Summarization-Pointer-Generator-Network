European migrant jobseekers should be barred from claiming the Government’s new  benefit, Iain Duncan Smith has said.

The Work and Pensions Secretary insisted access to universal credit, which is replacing all the main unemployment and sickness handouts, as well as tax credits, should be ‘much tighter’.

Mr Duncan Smith, the most Eurosceptic member of the Cabinet, suggested there should be an indefinite ban on unemployed EU incomers looking for work from claiming.

‘We have already introduced a series of measures to tighten up access to benefits: no longer can people come here from abroad and expect to get something for nothing. But there’s still more to do, which is why I am proposing that under universal credit EEA [European Economic Area] jobseekers will not be eligible to claim,’ he said.

‘Universal credit is much tighter because if you are unemployed and you come here you will not be able to claim… so that cracks down on benefit tourism.

‘The Prime Minister has made it very clear that he is determined to get changes made so that countries like Britain can limit the number of people who come to Britain over time from different countries - and that will affect universal credit.’

Mr Duncan Smith predicted most British benefit claimants will transferred onto the universal credit scheme by the end of 2018, a slower timetable than originally proposed.

He said employers have long found those on benefits unwilling to accept part-time or temporary jobs, since they risk losing tax credits, housing benefit or other handouts for positions that may not be secure, and turned to foreign workers.

But Mr Duncan Smith said universal credit, which guarantees that claimants are always better off working, even part-time, was creating a new boon in such positions for the British unemployed.

Universal credit will generate £7 billion a year in economic benefits, largely due to up to an additional 300,000 households finding work once the programme is fully implemented, he said.

The new benefit combines income-based jobseeker’s allowance, employment and support allowance, income support, child tax credit, working tax credit and housing benefit in an attempt to simplify the Byzantine welfare system.

Crucially, it means it is always worth people’s while to take a job or more hours if they already have one.

Mr Duncan Smith also revealed that as universal credit is rolled out across the country, he plans to impose new conditions on those working part-time to push them to do more.
