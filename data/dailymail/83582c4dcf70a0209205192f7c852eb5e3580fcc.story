Revealing: Ola Jordan has lifted the lid on some of Strictly Come Dancing's secrets

To viewers it is a well-oiled production of glitz, glamour and dazzling sequins.

But behind the scenes, Strictly Come Dancing is melting pot of high emotion, sexual tension – and lots of fake tan, according to one of its stars.

Dancer Ola Jordan even admitted what many suspect – that relationships do develop between dancers and celebrities, but many are hushed up.

Mrs Jordan, who is married to former Strictly professional James Jordan, 36, said: ‘It happens in the movies with actors and it happens on Strictly.

‘There have been relationships that have happened that have never come out in public, quite a bit. It happens as people get close. It is the bond you have with your partner.’

In 2009, boxer Joe Calzaghe split from girlfriend of five years Jo-Emma Larvin after being on the show. 

He went on to date dance partner Kristina Rihanoff for four years.

Mrs Jordan also revealed how the male celebrities face increasing pressure to appear shirtless, while the women are urged into skimpy outfits. 

Last year, finalist and former Coronation Street star Natalie Gumede, 30, repeatedly had to ask designers to add extra inches to her dresses.

Mrs Jordan said: ‘One day they are just going to give nipple tassels to come out with.’

Now aged 31, Mrs Jordan said she hated being filmed in high definition as she is conscious of being the oldest female dancer on the show and knows she could face the axe at any point as she has been performing on the show for so long.

Speaking at a launch for beauty brand Proactiv, which she is the face of, the dancer was scathing about use of fake tan by her colleagues.

She said: ‘Some of the girl dancers go crazy with tan. 

They have spray tans in the week and then on a show day they have more tan make-up on and they look dirty and streaky.

They go through a lot of tubs. It stains the clothes and goes everywhere. It is horrible. I hate it.’

But she added: ‘I am not going to say who are the worst culprits but they know who they are. They know who I am talking about. They are orange and they look as though they have been dipped in gravy.’

And Mrs Jordan remained diplomatic when discussing the atmosphere behind the scenes, saying: ‘You can’t get on with everyone. This is it. Strictly the show is quite stressful and hard but I have never cried.

‘It is not all glamour. What you see on a Saturday is the show and it is all perfect and we all look beautiful but behind the scenes there is a lot of hard work.’

Strictly returns in September, with Claudia Winkleman replacing Sir Bruce Forsyth as co-host.

Mrs Jordan said: ‘I will miss Brucie as a person being there. I had a soft spot for him and he had a soft spot for me.

‘But I like Claudia. She is so quirky. She can’t dance but you don’t have to dance to present the show.’
