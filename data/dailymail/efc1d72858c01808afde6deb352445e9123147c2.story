This is the dramatic moment a man, wanted by police, held a meat cleaver to his girlfriend's neck and threatened to kill her unless they let him go free. 

With a crazed look in his eye, suspected thief Zheng Mengjie held the knife at his terrified girlfriend's throat when police turned up to carry out an arrest warrant.

The 26-year-old told officers to leave his house in the city of Huizhou, in southern China's Guangdong Province, or they would have the blood of Xiu Shao, 23, on their hands.

Police spokesman Wen Tsou said: 'There were numerous charges against him all related to theft and as a result we wanted to bring him in for questioning. 

'But when officers broke down the door after he refused to open it, he was inside with the meat cleaver at his girlfriend's throat.' 

'The officers refused to leave and kept their guns pointed at him, and when they saw blood trickling from the young woman's neck because he was cutting her, they approached him and tried to get her away, but he stabbed at them with the glass injuring two. 

'They then made a decision to shoot him.'

Zheng was shot in the chest and dropped the meat cleaver, clutching his chest in agony.

An ambulance was then called to treat the two injured officers, and the suspected thief. 

Both Zheng and the wounded officers were taken to a local hospital for treatment with no life-threatening injuries.

Once he recovers, he will be charged with attempted murder as well as the original theft charges.
