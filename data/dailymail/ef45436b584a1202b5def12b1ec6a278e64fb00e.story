A father who rigged up a video camera in his kitchen to capture ghosts he thought were haunting his house accidentally caught his girlfriend making love to his teenage son instead.

Convinced his home had been overrun by supernatural spirits, the man, from Tasmania, Australia, set up the camcorder in his kitchen, pressed record and went to work.

But when he returned to view the footage his paranoia turned to horror as he watched his partner of 11 years enter the room and begin canoodling with his 16-year-old son.

Paranormal activity: The father, from Tasmania, Australia, originally rigged up the camera to capture ghosts he thought were haunting his house

The 28-year-old woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, pleaded guilty at Australia's Supreme Court to five counts of sex with a minor, claiming she hadn't realised 16 was below the age of consent.

The court heard how the affair began when she went into her de facto stepson's bedroom weeks earlier to discuss his driving lessons.

But the conversation soon turned to tickling, then kissing, cuddling and sex, the court heard.

She later took the boy upstate where they had sex several times in a hotel room.

The boy's father was so angry when he saw the pair petting in his haunted kitchen, he confronted his partner about what he had seen but she downplayed it as an innocent cuddle.

But his son told a different story, admitting they had had sex on several occasions. The man called the police and his girlfriend was duly arrested.

The court heard the woman was ashamed and embarrassed by her actions and had tried to repair the broken relationship.

However, her lawyer Steve Chopping told the courtroom: 'She accepts this is not a relationship which can or will continue.'

Justice David Porter remanded the woman in custody and will sentence her on Monday.

The case continues.
