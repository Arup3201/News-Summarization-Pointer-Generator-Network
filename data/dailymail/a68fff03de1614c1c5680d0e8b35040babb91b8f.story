A TV flower expert and his boyfriend were wrongly mistaken for terrorists and quizzed by police as they sat eating quiche and chips at a seafront cafe.

Jonathan Moseley, who appears on BBC 2's The Big Allotment Challenge, was baffled when officers approached him outside  Terrace Cafe in Redcar, north Yorkshire. 

The florist and his partner Bish Sharif were accused of approaching staff in a nearby New Look and told they could face terrorism offences before police realised they had reached the wrong people.

Jonathan Moseley and his partner Bish Sharif (above) were approached by Cleveland Police officers and warned they could face terrorism offences as they ate lunch in a seafront cafe 

Mr Moseley said he would be making a formal complaint after being left 'shaken up' by the experience. 

He and his partner were enjoying lunch when two Cleveland Police officers walked in to the cafe and demanded to speak to them outside. 

'A police van pulled up outside, then a policeman and woman entered the cafe and walked towards our table,' Mr Molesley said.

'They asked me and my partner to step outside because they needed to talk to us about an incident.

'When I said "what?" they said we needed to step outside - that it would be less embarrassing for us if we didn't.

'They said we’d been seen on CCTV in New Look approaching staff and telling them not to worry, that we were military police and monitoring a possible terrorist incident happening in Redcar.

'It was totally bizarre - we hadn’t even been in New Look....but they were adamant CCTV footage confirmed it was us.'

After asking whether he could see the offending footage Mr Molesley claims he was curtly told he could face terrorism charges.  

The pair were told to leave the cafe and answer police officers' questions outside or 'they would be embarrassed'

Mr Moseley now plans to take action against the force for the incident. Cleveland Police has apologised since

'Apparently the reason we were linked to it was we fitted the description of wearing boots and dark jackets. But even though I knew we’d done nothing wrong, I was starting to get really panicky - it looked like we might get arrested for a potentially serious offence we had absolutely no knowledge of. 

'But eventually, they told us it might be a case of mistaken identity and we were free to go.'

After leaving the seaside town the television personality said he was planning on taking further action against the force.  

'Redcar police need to be held accountable for this. It’s just such a negative thing to happen to people coming to Redcar as tourists, hoping to enjoy a nice day out. 

'We certainly don’t feel like rushing to come back.' 

A Cleveland Police spokeswoman said: 'We would like to apologise to these two gentlemen for any disruption to their afternoon caused by some confusion with descriptions.

'Two other gentlemen were spoken to and all parties were given advice.' 

The men were accused of approaching staff in a nearby New Look (above). It is thought police mistook them for the culprits because they were dressed similarly 

Mr Moseley is a flower expert and often appears BBC 2 programmes including The Big Allotment Challenge
