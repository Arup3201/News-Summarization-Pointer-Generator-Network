My miracle: Lisa with her son Liam, 3. Doctors said she would never be able to conceive naturally

A woman who was told she would never give birth naturally after going through the menopause three decades early has told how she defied doctors to have a baby boy.

Lisa Burt had begun trying for a baby when she was 24, but within a year her hopes of a large family appeared cruelly dashed when she discovered her body had been undergoing the change since she was just 17.

The healthcare assistant and her partner Dominic Lowe, who are both now 31, had gone to doctors after failing to conceive for a year.

But they told her she would be unable to conceive naturally and she started a course of hormone replacement therapy.

Lisa said: 'When I went for the tests I just thought that at worst my body was being a bit slow and they’d prescribe me fertility drugs to make it happen a bit quicker.

'When they told me I was going through the menopause I went into shock. I was sure they must have had my results mixed up with an older lady. How could I be going through the menopause, I was only 25?

'I looked over at my partner and saw tears in his eyes and realised what it meant – that we would never be able to have kids. I was utterly devastated.'

Lisa had always dreamed of having a large family with her partner, who she met ten years ago.

Confident that she would quickly get pregnant after coming off the pill when she was 24, Lisa allowed herself to start picking names. But after a year of trying she visited her GP.

When he asked her about her cycle she told him her periods had always been irregular and he arranged blood tests. Days later the results were back and showed Lisa’s hormone levels were lower than expected. A little anxious, the couple thought it wouldn’t take much to sort out.

But the truth was far worse. After hospital tests, their consultant broke the news that Lisa was one of a small percentage of women to start the menopause early. He estimated she may have been as young as 17 when it began.

'It was like our whole future had been ripped away. I was mourning for the life I thought I would have – full of kids. I felt like I was letting Dom down, too,' Lisa said.

It was explained their only real hope lay in egg donation.

Overjoyed: Dom with baby Liam. Lisa was five-months pregnant before the couple relalised

'In sheer panic I sat my younger sister down and asked if she would consider donating her eggs,' Lisa said.

'I cried when she said she would and paid for us to see a private fertility expert. They
gave us lots of different scenarios to consider – for example, what 
if she gave me some eggs and was then unable to fall pregnant?

'It made me realise it wasn’t something we could rush into. My sister was only 20 and I didn’t want to pressure her.'

But as the weeks passed, depression set in. 'Everywhere I looked there seemed to be pregnant women and babies,' recalls Lisa. 'Dom was brilliant but it was tough.'

Then in November 2007 she saw alternative therapist Reef Steele after a friend recommended him.

Mr Steele explained that he would try to alter the way she thought about pregnancy in the hope her body would follow suit.

He told her to visualise herself conceiving, being pregnant and finally giving birth.

'After the session I felt hugely relaxed,' Lisa said.

'I’d
really enjoyed it and left feeling positive for the first time in ages.
I didn’t think I would get pregnant, but I felt better.'

Then seven months later in July 2008 she and Dom went on holiday where she complained about feeling bloated.

She said: 'I put it down to the side effects of the HRT. I also thought I might be constipated after rubbish on holiday.'

But then the couple began wondering whether Lisa could be pregnant - and dashed to the supermarket to buy a test.

'I was shaking when the line turned blue,' said Lisa.

When they returned home Lisa saw her GP.

'I lay down and he started examining me. Then he gave me the biggest smile and said  "Congratulations",' she said.

Happy family: Lisa and Dom with Liam. They said they were still hopeful about having another child

He estimated she was already five months pregnant, and had conceived about two months after having alternative therapy.

Lisa stopped taking HRT and just 16 weeks later in December 2008 gave birth to Liam. He is now a boisterous three-year-old.

'Holding him for the first time was the best moment of my life,' she said.

After the birth, Lisa was put back on HRT and she says that if she and Dom decide to try for another baby she’ll be making an appointment with Reef.

'I don’t know what he did, but I felt instantly better and a few months later I was pregnant after being told it was impossible. However it happened, I’m so lucky it did,' she said.
