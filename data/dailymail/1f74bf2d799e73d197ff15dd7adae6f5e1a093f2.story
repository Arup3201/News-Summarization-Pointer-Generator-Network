Emily Clark is desperate for a bone marrow or stem cell transplant before the New Year, after doctors revealed she is battling cancer for a second time

Teenager Emily Clark dreams of becoming a doctor.

But before she can embark on making her ambition a reality, the 17-year-old has another, more pressing challenge.

Emily needs a life-saving bone marrow or stem cell transplant, and she needs it for Christmas.

Last month specialists told the teenager a transplant is her only hope.

The 17-year-old is fighting non hodgkin (burkitts) lymphoma for a second time.

She was first diagnosed in December last year but after four courses of chemotherapy she was declared free of the disease in April.

But Emily's world came crashing down again on November 13, when doctors revealed the cancer had returned.

Her siblings were tested, but weren't a match for their sister, leaving a donation from a stranger the only option. 

And so Emily has launched a drive to encourage people to give the gift of life this Christmas, by signing up to the Anthony Nolan donation register.  

Emily, from Cwmbran in Wales, told MailOnline: 'This time we're bringing out all the weaponry, guns blazing to kick this cancer's ass, good and proper.'

The teenager, whose blog is called Remission Possible, has previously written in support of the charity and other families in need of a donor, not knowing she would one day need a transplant herself. 

Emily was diagnosed with Lymphoma in December 2013, after she noticed her stomach was swelling and her jeans had become tighter.

Scans revealed the swelling was cancer. 

'I'd never been to the GPs before. Being ill just didn't happen to me, it was normally my brothers and sisters,' Emily said.

'It was right before Christmas, and was just so much to take in; I knew it was going to change my life.

'I love school, I'm a total nerd so it was just horrible to know I was missing out. With every needle they stuck in, it just sunk in even more.'

Following four courses of chemotherapy, Emily was given the news she was clear of cancer on April 17. 

It was this that spurred her on to start her blog Remission Possible, to help others facing similar journeys. 

The 17-year-old was first diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin (Burkitts) Lymphoma in December last year. After going into remission in April, her disease returned last month.

'It was simply amazing to be told I was in remission,' Emily said. 'It seemed like a great place to start the blog from, April 18, 2014, and my first full day officially cancer free.

'It was such a long time coming.

'I set up Remission Possible to thank everyone who helped me to be in remission and as the blog's tagline says, 'Because you never choose the mission of cancer - we all have to accept it and fight on'.

Lymphoma is a type of blood cancer that affects the lymphatic system, an important part of the immune system.

A patient with the disease will make too many lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell.

And those lymphocytes live longer than they should.

The overload compromises the immune system, which is designed to protect the body from infection and disease.

Lymphoma can develop in many parts of the body, including a person's lymph nodes, bone marrow, blood, spleen and other organs.

There are two main types of lymphoma - non-hodgkin and hodgkin.

Most are non-hodgkin lymphoma - the sixth most common cancer in the UK.

Every year, around 12,000 people are diagnosed with the disease in the UK.

It is more common in older people, with one in six sufferers over the age of 65.

Burkitt lymphoma is a rare form of non-hodgkin lymphoma, affecting the B-cells in the body.

There are three different forms of Burkitt lymphoma, two of which are linked to the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes glandular fever.

The third occurs in patients who have had an organ transplant and are taking medicines to stop their immune system rejecting the transplant.

The most common early symptom is swelling in the lymph nodes.

The lymphoma can often appear as a lump or mass in the tummy area, which can cause pain and swelling, nausea and diarrhoea.

Some sufferers will also experience night sweats, high temperatures and weight loss.

'I wanted to help young people in their fight and raise awareness so others can see the symptoms of cancer.' 

While she was in remission, Emily supported various campaigns for people searching for a match like the Help Hollie #pantsonyourhead campaign.

At the time, Emily had no idea she would be launching a similar campaign of her own. 

Last month, after feeling unwell, the 17-year-old went back to the doctors.

They revealed her cancer had returned, and for Emily, life was put on hold.

She postponed plans to study medicine at university.

'I was devastated, I had just applied to university and my life was getting back on track,' she said.

'Relapsing isn't the end of Remission Possible, it may be our true beginning.

'I have no choice but to accept my new mission. 

'This time we're bringing out all the weaponry, guns blazing to kick this cancer's ass, and forever, not just for me but for the 2,000 other people out there who need a transplant each year.' 

Since launching her campaign to encourage people to sign the register, Anthony Nolan have received 278 successful applications in Wales.  

And Emily has received support from celebrity comedian Matt Lucas and singer Michael Ball, who tweeted about Emily's blog.

Emily's mother, Donna said: 'When Emily was diagnosed with cancer our world changed in an instant. 

'But I now feel empowered to make a difference by signing up as many people to the register as possible.

'I can't thank enough every person who has signed up to the register for Emily and others like her. Together we can help Emily make another mission possible to beat cancer again.'

Emily's cancer returning was the latest in a long line of challenges the Clark family have faced in recent years.

Since 2006, her siblings, Holly, 16, Evan, 10 and five-year-old Libby, have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, epilepsy, asthma, dyslexia and dyspraxia. 

Mrs Clark, said: 'Our family life has been through a lot of changes over the past year, and we've been as honest as you can be with a four, nine and 15-year-old.

'Christmas had to be rescheduled and having younger children was a juggling act.

'Footie practice, choir and GCSEs exams also had to continue as family life had to go on in some capacity, for everyone's sake.

'Emily missed home and the little ones missed her - winter coughs colds kept us all apart at times. 

'Myself and my husband Andrew have missed each other, we passed on the motorway like ships in the night. 

'Trying to ensure one of us was at the hospital 12 hours a day and the other was home was a mammoth task, as anyone can imagine.

'But we have also been blessed to be able to add to our family. We don't feel unlucky but the complete opposite. We are so lucky to have these children. They enrich our live beyond words.'

Ann O'Leary, Head of Register Development at Anthony Nolan, said: 'Emily has been a selfless supporter of Anthony Nolan even before she needed a transplant by supporting other families in desperate need online. 

'Emily is now reliant upon other strangers to join the register and pledge to save a life by donating their stem cells.

'What many people don't realise is how easy it is to join the bone marrow register – it simply involves filling in a form and providing a saliva sample.'

To sign up to the Anthony Nolan register visit www.anthonynolan.org and tick 'Remission Possible' as your reason for joining.
