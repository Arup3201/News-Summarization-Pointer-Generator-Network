An intoxicated man has been caught on camera crashing his car and stripping off in front of stunned onlookers.

Vincent Wade allegedly got drunk and smashed a car outside Crown Fried Chicken in Philadelphia about 10.30am Monday.

But as the mercury plunged to a low 38 degrees, so did the 34-year-old's pants.

The New Jersey resident got out of the silver Camry, undressed and began pleasuring himself - and it was all filmed.

Choking the chicken: Vincent Wade, 34, was caught on camera playing with himself after crashing a car outside a Philadelphia chicken shop and stripping on Monday

The bemused man who shot the gripping saga on his phone assured Philly Mag that Wade was practicing self-love just 400 feet from an elementary school.

'Oh, he was most definitely making himself feel happy,' he said.

According to the police report, Wade was sitting in the driver's seat when cops arrived and his clothes were torn off. He couldn't stand on his own.

Witnesses told officers that Wade tried to drive off after his over-the-top display, but luckily someone removed the keys and held them until 
police arrived.

The Crown Fried Chicken manager said damage to the restaurant was minimal.

Police charged Wade with driving under the influence. But on public lewdness charges? He got off.

He was released from jail after posting a $500 bond.
