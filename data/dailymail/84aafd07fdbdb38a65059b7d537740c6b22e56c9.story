Property website Zoopla accidentally rated this run-down cul-de-sac in the West Midlands as one of Britain's most expensive residential streets - with prices averaging  £3.6million.

A computer software glitch calculated that houses in Crawshaws Road in Castle Bromwich were among the most desirable in the country.

The error put the modest neighbourhood above London's most prestigious postcode W8 in Kensington where house prices average £2.78million.

Error: Property website Zoopla accidentally rated this run-down cul-de-sac in the West Midlands as one of Britain's most expensive residential streets - with prices averaging £3.6million

Price hike: The error put the modest neighbourhood above London's most prestigious postcode W8 in Kensington where house prices average £2.78million

Homeowners on the 38-house road were stunned after their properties apparently rocketed to almost 30 times more than their actual value of just over £125,000.

The error in the firm's Property Rich List 2014 declared the average house price on Crawshaws Road - which is mostly made up of social housing - was £3,562,687.

Incredibly, the Knightsbridge postcode SW7 is the next most expensive with average values reaching £2.48 million while prices in Chelsea's SW3 are £2.37million.

Pricey: The average house price on Crawshaws Road was given as £3,562,687, higher than the Knightsbrige SW7 postcode

Desirable: The glitch priced the homes in Crawshaws Road above those in Wellington Court, Knightsbridge

Zoopla bosses spotted the mistake  after it was published and blamed it on a fault in the formula used to estimate the value of thousands of UK homes.

People living on the road - just 200 yards from the busy M6 motorway - have been amused their neighbourhood has been ranked as one of Britain's most sought-after addresses.

Tracy Hogan, 50, who works at Asda and as a school dinner lady, paid £114,000 for her three-bedroom house in 2004.

The mother-of-three joked: 'It's hilarious really but it explains why I've got two jobs because obviously I need to work more to keep myself in the lifestyle I've become accustomed to.

Seeing the funny side: Tracy Hogan, 50, and Bev Bridges, 36, were stunned after their properties apparently rocketed to almost 30 times more than their actual value of just over £125,000

Typical: Mother-of-three Bev Bridges, 36, said the street was a typical working class area

'Now that we're officially living on one of Britain's most expensive streets we're thinking of getting some posh gates fitted at the top of the road to stop the riff raff coming in.

'Even the postman's going to get vetted from now on. We're going up in the world.

'I reckon our house prices have gone up because of HS2. It's planned to come up right beside us so obviously that's going to make it a desirable place to live for commuters.'

Husband Steve, 42, an engineer, added: 'I have heard the estate has been suggested as a site for oil fracking.

'There's supposed to be a lot of fossil fuels beneath the ground.

'We're doing our house up at the moment, but I think we could only dream of fetching £3.6million.'

Single mother-of-three Bev Bridges, 36, has lived in a housing association-owned property for 14 years with her two teenage daughters and 11-year-old son.

'Uncommon': Zoopla said an 'uncommon' flaw in the algorithm which assesses factors such as previous sale values, characteristics and size had led to the mistake

Facts: Crawshaws Road is part of a suburb just two miles north of Birmingham which had a population of 11,857 in the 2001 census

She said: 'It's very funny for Crawshaws Road to get mentioned alongside the posh neighbourhoods of Knightsbridge and Chelsea.

'We're a typical suburban street full of working class families, single mums like myself and council houses. We're enjoying the attention this has brought us.'

Retired Chubb worker Keith Warren, 66, who has lived on the street since 1980, added: 'I'd be very happy if my house was worth that.

'I don't know where they've got that figure from. 

Mistake: Another resident Luke Norris, 29, said: 'I'd love it if my house was worth £3.6million but they've obviously made a mistake'

'I've seen a lot of changes in the time I've lived here.

'The road was one of the first on the estate to be built so it used to be in the middle of a field.

'I used to drive down from Water Orton Lane through potato fields so it's a bit different nowadays.'

Another resident Luke Norris, 29, added: 'I'd love it if my house was worth £3.6million but they've obviously made a mistake.

'You only need to look at the street to know that.

'I've lived here most of my life, but would have sold up if my house was worth that much.'

Zoopla said an 'uncommon' flaw in the algorithm which assesses factors such as previous sale values, characteristics and size had led to the mistake.

 'Zoopla property values are created using multiple data sources,' said a spokesman.

'We have a rigorous system and process in place that continuously checks the data for any outliers such as the one you identified.

'This over-inflated estimate was in a queue to be manually checked.

'The estimate for the street is actually £125,619 and we have now updated this to reflect a more accurate average property value for that street

'Consequently this street has not made it on to our Rich List.'
