This is the moment a diver comes within inches of being fish food as a giant hammerhead shark bares its teeth at him.

Diver Eli Martinez bravely stands his ground after coming face-to-face with the prehistoric hunting machine while free diving outside a protective cage.

The close encounter was photographed off Bimini Island in the Bahamas.

After multiple trips and hours of diving nearby they finally got used to Eli in January this year

Eli said: 'They don't have a lot of interest in divers as they are so interested in the bait we are offering them'

Eli, free diving outside of a protective cage, carefully handled the sea creature despite its menacing razor-sharp teeth - but admitted they are extremely shy and need a lot of work to allow divers close to them.

After multiple trips and hours of diving
 nearby they finally got used to Eli in January this year - hammerheads 
regularly visit these waters during the winter season.

He said: 'This was my second season visiting the great hammerheads of Bimini and working with them this close.

Hammerheads are coveted by the shark fin trade because of their very large fins so they have been relentlessly hunted

Great hammerheads are an endangered species and protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora

'They are very finicky sharks - they are very particular about the bait that you use when chumming for them.

'You can't use the same type of bait that would attract other species of sharks in because it won't work.

'They
 are very large sharks but they are elegant predators. They don't have a
 lot of interest in divers as they are so interested in the bait we are 
offering them.

Eli Martinez (pictured) described it as an 'honor' and a 'privilege' to spend time with the sharks

'But you still have to respect these animals and be careful, following the obvious rules they demand.'

Eli,
 who runs shark diving tours through his website, 
hopes to change the negative perception people have about sharks.

He
 added: 'Great hammerheads are an endangered species and protected by 
the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild 
Fauna and Flora.

'They are 
coveted by the shark fin trade because of their very large fins so they 
have been relentlessly hunted and the global population of these sharks 
has suffered.

'Fortunately the Bahamas is a shark sanctuary and while they are in these waters they enjoy protection.

'It
 is truly a privilege to spend time in the water with these animals and 
an honour to be able to share them with the world to show how amazing 
and beautiful they truly are.'
