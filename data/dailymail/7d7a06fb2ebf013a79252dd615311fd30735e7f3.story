Police are hunting a violent parolee who is suspected of pushing to his death in front of New York subway train as his horrified wife looked on.

Wai Kuen Kwok, 61, was with his wife on Sunday when he was shoved by a man believed to be homeless man Kevin Darden.

Darden, 35, has more than 30 arrests, including for trying to set his brother's house on fire and has also served time in prison.

He was most recently arrested November 9 in Midtown for pick-pocketing, reports The New York Post.

The couple were waiting for the D train, at the 167th street stop and were headed to Chinatown, in lower Manhattan. 

The suspect allegedly pushed the man from the platform just as a train arrived in the station, shortly before 9:00 am, as his horrified wife watched helplessly.

The victim and his attacker did not appear to know each other and had not argued, witnesses said.

Police released a video of the suspected killer, who left the scene by bus. 

On the video, a man wearing a black jacket over a dark t-shirt gets off the bus, goes into a store, and emerges to smoke a cigarette as he ambles away.

A reward of $2,000 was offered for any information that could help the investigation.

Train driver James Muriel told The New York Post that he is grieving for Kwok's widow.

'I would like to apologize to the family,' Muriel said. 'There was nothing I could have done.

'I see a body flying across the tracks. I placed the train in emergency. The train doesn't stop right away,' he went on.

Danger:  Kwok was pushed off the platform at the Grand Concourse and East 167th Street station in Highbridge

Mystery: There was no indication that Kwok knew the man or had an altercation with him before he was pushed, police said

'All of my passengers were crying with me. They were consoling me. They told me it wasn't my fault.'

Every year, dozens of people are killed by the subway in New York though accident or suicide.

However, this is first known incident of a person being pushed to his or her death on the tracks since December 2012, when two were killed in separate attacks.

On December 28, a woman pushed an Indian immigrant to his death in Queens.

Weeks earlier on December 3, a man was pushed from a stop in Manhattan during a fight with a deranged man.

A New York Post front page picture of the man on the tracks a split-second before he was killed by the oncoming train provoked public fury as to why no one helped him -- and why the tabloid newspaper published the photo.
