The outage lasted more than two hours, with frantic HSBC staff finally finding a fix at 4.50pm.

HSBC was today hit by a nationwide systems crash thought to have affected millions of customers.

The bank's cash machines, branches, debit cards, and internet banking services all stopped working at 2.45pm after a computer glitch.

The outage lasted more than two hours, with frantic HSBC staff finally finding a fix at 4.50pm.

Earlier, a Twitter storm erupted with worried customers saying they could not withdraw money from HSBC cash machines and their cards had been declined in shops.

When This is Money rang the call centre it was engaged and both HSBC and First Direct internet banking was unavailable.First Direct said its systems came back online at 16.40 - some two hours after the problem hit.

HSBC customers were locked out until 16.53, when cards and internet banking were switched back on.

On its Twitter feed, the bank said: 'Card terminals and internet banking should now be back on. Sorry and thanks again for bearing with us.'

Earlier, customers Tweeted to say branch staff told them the bank's services 'had gone down across the nation'.

Other reports suggested the problem may have extended worldwide, with the bank operational in 47 countries.

HSBC told This is Money it is investigating what exactly went wrong but it is believed to have been a central computer failure.

In a statement, the bank had said: 'We are aware of some problems and are looking into them as a matter of priority.'

Hundreds of HSBC customers took to Twitter to complain about the problems

Helen Dadd, 23, an HSBC customer from
Birkenhead, said: 'I went out and tried three cash machines and none 
would let me draw my money out.

'I went to the bank and asked if it was my personal account or if it was the system and they said their system was down.

'They didn't say when it would be up. I haven't got any cash at all.'It's just shocking.'

HSBC is one of the 'Big Four' banks in the UK, serving more than 15million customers, and is the largest UK bank by market size.

It has also been considered one of the strongest during the financial crisis and did not require a taxpayer-funded bailout.

The internet service went down at 2.45pm, causing cards to also be declined at tills and ATMs.

Mark Hemingway, head of UK Retail Banking told MailOnline: 'At a quarter to two our UK-based online services went down.

'All services are being introduced over the course of the afternoon.

'Of course, with it being a Friday afternoon, it was a very busy time and we apologise for any inconvenience caused.

He added the problems began at 2.45pm and only affect customers in the UK.

He said he was confident there was no security risk to customers' accounts as a result of the glitch.

In the banks, tellers appeared 
confused about what was going on. At 2.55pm, an HSBC employee in the 
Kensington High Street branch, in London, said that the whole system was
down and had been for about 20 minutes.

She suggested that it might take 
another 20 minutes to get the system up and running. But it seemed clear
that the bank did not know what the problem was or how to solve it.

'I expect the lights to go out next,' she remarked before advising getting money out at the cashiers.

Many took to Twitter to voice their disappointment.

WPC Pink tweeted: 'Can't pay for my shopping in Tesco! Thank you HSBC.'

Jack Clark added: 'HSBC internet banking down after multiple tries. HSBC phone banking not working either.'

While Jason Wyer-Smith voiced many 
HSBC customers' biggest fears. He tweeted: 'Just had my HSBC card turned
down at the petrol station. Not great but also quietly pleased it's 
probably not down to my overspending.'

The incident mimics a similar 
situation affecting HSBC in 2006. The bank blamed ‘a standard server 
issue’ for the two-hour problem that blocked a computer from verifying 
the identities of cardholders.
