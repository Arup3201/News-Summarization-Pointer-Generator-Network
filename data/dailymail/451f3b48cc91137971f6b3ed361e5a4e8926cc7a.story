Nick Easter has defied convention throughout his career. The veteran No 8 did not plough a conventional furrow from academy into the professional ranks.

He followed a lesser-trodden path to the top — via Rosslyn Park and Orrell — before embarking on an 11-year association with Harlequins which shows little sign of ending.

A new contract is being discussed and, with the 36-year-old playing as well as ever, both parties are keen to agree a deal.

Despite the advancing years, and Quins’ domestic struggles this season, the former England star has no plans to hang up his boots and make way for the next generation.

Easter believes he still has unfinished business at international level — although he is less optimistic about his chances of ever completing it — while the challenge of pitting his mental and physical strengths against younger men on a weekly basis remains a huge motivating force.

He will take the field at the Aviva Stadium to face Leinster ‘fresh’ from a man-of-the-match performance last Sunday which prompted Conor O’Shea, Quins’ director of rugby, to predict his senior statesman could carry on until he is 40.

‘I’m enjoying it and my body’s holding out,’ Easter said. ‘My mind remains fresh, too... it’s not just about whether your body fails you when people decide to pack in. There’s also the mental side.

‘You’re always aware you could just wake up one day and not feel like your body is up to it any more. But they monitor your fitness, strength, speed and everything else — I’m still improving those scores.

The Quins star still relishes taking on the next generation of young players, despite turning 36 this year

‘The age thing has never bothered me. It’s been as much about the mental side as the physical. I’m still hungry to win things with Quins. That’s what drives me on.

‘You’ve got to adjust to the way the game is going all the time. I am fortunate to be at a club where I can judge myself because we’ve got so many successful young kids coming through the system.

‘It is not as if I’m keeping up with the old guard and the dinosaurs. I’ve got to keep up with the younger guys.

‘If I was just doing it ticking off the years I don’t think it would be worth carrying on. I don’t want to be dead wood in a squad and not contributing in the way I have over the past 11 seasons.

‘With all the youngsters coming through you get a proper benchmark of where you are in the modern game. At the moment I’m happy with where I am.’

One of those ‘kids’ will be alongside Easter in the back-row tonight with 21-year-old Jack Clifford starting against the three-time European champions in place of injured England captain Chris Robshaw, who the club yesterday announced will not need surgery on the shoulder he injured last week against Leinster.

Twenty-one-year-old fly-half Tim Swiel also starts at No 10 in place of the injured Nick Evans.

A repeat of last Sunday’s impressive home victory over the same opponents would leave Quins sitting pretty with four wins from four at the top of Pool 2.

‘Missing those guys does make the job harder but we’re halfway through the season now and you half expect those kind of injuries,’ Easter added. ‘It’s about a squad effort if you want to achieve any silverware.

‘We are expecting a massive war down there with a huge step-up in intensity.

‘We know we’re going to have to be better than we were on Sunday and they will definitely be stronger. They are a class outfit.’

On the subject of class, it has been clear for some time that Easter’s is of the permanent variety.

The last of his 47 caps came in Martin Johnson’s final game in charge as England coach. That abject World Cup quarter-final defeat by France in 2011 marked the end of a disastrous England campaign as well as Johnson’s reign.

And, despite continuing to produce international-quality club displays, it appears increasingly unlikely that Easter will ever wear the Red Rose again.

Easter has not spoken seriously about an England return with current coach Stuart Lancaster

He has not spoken seriously about rugby to current England coach Stuart Lancaster or his coaching staff for more than two years and, with the World Cup less than a year away, it will require a seismic shift in selection policy for him to earn a recall to the international side.

‘It’s very hard because this conversation has been going on ever since I was left out of the side when Stuart came on board,’ he said. ‘I don’t think I could have done much more with my performances. You never say never but it’s clearly a very long shot.

‘The door is not shut on England but the handle is turning. But I’m still motivated. I enjoyed my England career but it ended on a low and that is a bit of unfinished business that still motivates me.

‘I’m happy with the way I’m playing. It’s a pity I can’t do it on the international stage but I’ve got Leinster in front of 50,000 people at the Aviva which is the next best thing.

‘I don’t really have time to feel sorry for myself.’
