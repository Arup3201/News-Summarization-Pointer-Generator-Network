The soothing tones of Bob Marley drifted through the air at Stamford Bridge as the teams prepared for extra-time. Some were down on their haunches, receiving pellets of information, others flat on their backs receiving muscle rubs.

'Don't Worry 'bout a Thing,' sang Bob. Then Didier Drogba came on. If this were T20 cricket it might have been his theme tune, a special request on his 37th birthday.

Why worry? This was all under control. Never in doubt. Someone seemed to be guiding Chelsea on a celestial path into the last eight. Was it Eden Hazard? Thibaut Courtois? Bjorn Kuipers? Bob Marley and the Wailers? Jose Mourinho and the Wailers? Or another other-worldly force.

Turned out it was none of them. Turned out there was something to worry about. That something was Paris Saint-Germain, a team with bottle to match their talent. A team which took everything Mourinho could throw their way, scored twice from set-pieces and emerged triumphant.

It leaves Chelsea to focus on the Barclays Premier League title. Roman Abramovich looked down from his seat in the West Stand. The Champions League will have to wait for another year. And it leaves English football to contemplate the prospect of no teams in the last eight for the second time in three years.

Chelsea can have no complaints. Almost every decision went their way. Still Mourinho had the audacity to shake his head when the fourth official declared two added minutes at the end of extra time.

His players left the pitch in scenes reminiscent to the defeat against Barcelona, only this time they would not blame the referee.

And it all seemed to be going to plan, When the chaos first descended before half-time, Mourinho snuggled back into his seat alongside Rui Faria in the Chelsea dug-out. A few yards to his right, Laurent Blanc was flapping his arms in despair. On the pitch, David Luiz was in danger of losing control. 

Story of the game: minute 31, minute 43, minute 58, minute 96, minute 114 as is the fashion at Stamford Bridge. At least, that's how it went on the previous outing, an equally frenzied draw against Burnley, the fall-out of which was still falling out days later.

Here was Mourinho's chaos theory unfolding again. Traps set were stumbled into by PSG, a club still naive to the injustices of this competition in the closing stages, when the teams are so tightly matched, tactics cautious and the importance of decisions by the officials magnified beyond belief.

Chelsea learned the hard way over the years but are now among the most seasoned. They break up play, they milk the contact, they circulate the tacklers, they over-react and pressurise the officials. On the side, Jose and the Wailers do their bit.

It does not guarantee anything, of course. Not against this calibre of opposition. But every little helps, and their manager understands this better than most. Hence his pre-match posturing and the clear mind to react when the tie tilts and blurs.

As the first half ended in manic scenes, Mourinho made his decisions. Here was the theory amid the chaos. Off came Oscar, to prevent a second yellow card, to tighten the centre of the pitch with Ramires and to add the fizz of Willian.

Cards played, the manager was tenser and prowled his technical area during the second half, his hands sunk into his coat pockets, until it was time to remonstrate and demand more his players. Tighter, faster, they could not allow the tempo to slip against PSG. 

Edinson Cavani rattled the woodwork. That was minute 58. Perhaps he should have scored. His team-mates threw themselves to the turf in despair. Minute 43 was a penalty Chelsea might have had.

Minute 31 was the red card for Zlatan Ibrahimovic. It was harsh and it might have killed off weaker teams. Not so Paris. They have bottle to go with their ability.

Chelsea had work to do. They had to stop football breaking out, for one thing, because when it did, the French were better at it. As in Paris, Courtois came under fire as those in front of him started to wilt.

It has been an intense campaign and, despite his fears about the relentless intensity of the English game and the way some training sessions are more competitive than the games in French football, Mourinho has been low on rotation.

He has relied instead on the rotation enforced by various suspensions. On Thursday night he lost Matic, and the decision to send on Kurt Zouma backfired when they conceded almost immediately.

Minute 81 they liked at the Bridge. Minute 86, not so much. When Gary Cahill scored, the first thing Mourinho did was to turn to the crowd and urged calm. Then he sent on Zouma.

When Luiz equalised, again he called for calm. This time the message was aimed at his players. Take it into extra-time if necessary, with the extra man. That was the idea.

No-one had Minute 114 on their Burnley bingo card. This time the chaos theory did not work.
