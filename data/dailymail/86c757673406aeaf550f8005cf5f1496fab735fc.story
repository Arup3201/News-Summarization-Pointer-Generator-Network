Pure horsemeat imported from Hungary was sold to British shoppers as 'diced beef', officials have confirmed.

Nearly half the meat had already been sold to the public before its true provenance was discovered.

The Food Standards Agency said that 100kg (220lb) of horsemeat was imported by Hungarian Food Ltd in Preston, Lancashire, and sold on its market stall in town and a shop in Liverpool.

Ongoing investigation: Officers from Lancashire County Council, pictured, made the discovery and the remaining unsold meat has been withdrawn from sale

The remaining unsold 1kg bags have been withdrawn from sale.

An FSA spokesman said: 'The Food 
Standards Agency has been informed by Lancashire County Council that it 
has identified 100kg of horsemeat imported from Hungary labelled as 
beef.

'The meat was imported by Hungarian Food Ltd in Preston.

'Investigations showed that 40kg 
(90lb) were sold through Hungarian Food Ltd's own market stall in 
Preston, and through a shop in Liverpool called Taste of Hungary.

Horsemeat: The latest revelations come after Leeds-based supermarket giant Asda admitted it had removed its £1.54 corned beef products from stores across Britain two weeks ago on March 8

'The meat was sold in 1kg (2.2lb) bags labelled as “diced beef”.

'The Food Standards Agency has notified the European Commission and the Hungarian authorities.'

The meat is being tested for  the anti-inflammatory veterinary drug bute, the FSA confirmed.

The manager of Taste of Hungary admitted that he ate some of the meat, thinking it was beef.

Attila Fabian, who runs the shop in 
Sefton, Merseyside, said that he bought 20 bags from Hungarian Food Ltd 
last May instead of importing it directly – but it sold so badly that he
took four or five bags home for his family.

'It tasted like beef, it looked  like beef. I was shocked when environmental health told me what happened exactly.'

Mr Fabian said his shop sold about a 
dozen bags of the horsemeat, leaving three bags left in the freezer. 
They have now been taken away for tests. He said the shop had ceased 
trading with Hungarian Food Ltd after the firms 'fell out' last July.

The horsemeat food-labelling scandal 
began when Irish food inspectors announced in mid-January that they had 
found horse in frozen beef- burgers made by firms in Ireland and 
Britain, and sold by a number of supermarket chains including Tesco, 
Iceland, Aldi and Lidl.

Since then, a growing number of stores
and companies across Europe, including Findus and Nestle, have recalled
beef ready-meals after tests found they contained horse DNA.

Beginning of a national scandal: Tesco Everyday Value beefburgers were one of the first products removed from shelves removed after it was discovered they contained horse meat

Minced beef supplied to hundreds of 
hospitals, schools, hotels and care homes by caterer 3663 was recalled 
because of horsemeat contamination.

Its own-label minced beef was supplied
by a company called  GA International, which is based  in Yorkshire. 
The same processor also supplied contaminated mince to a second major 
catering company, Sodexo, which would have passed it on to schools, care
homes and military bases.

A survey this month showed that three in five people have changed their eating habits in the wake of the scandal.

Nearly a third are buying less 
processed meat, such as burgers, while one in four now avoid meat-based 
ready-meals, according to consumer group Which?.

It wants the Government to take urgent steps to ensure food labels are accurate, and for more random testing to be introduced.
