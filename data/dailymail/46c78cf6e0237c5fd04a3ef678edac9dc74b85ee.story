The body of Alice Gross was found wrapped in plastic and buried under logs in the river Brent 

Former Met police officers have expressed concern that the senseless murder of 14-year-old Alice Gross bears disturbing parallels with two other unsolved cases from the same area.

This week, Alice's body was found wrapped in plastic and buried under logs in a West London river.

The murder investigation has a prime suspect, Arnis Zalkalns, a convicted murderer from Latvia, who vanished from his home in west London, days after Alice went missing.

But former Met Office police officers are worried about the striking similarities between Alice's murder and two unsolved cases from the London borough of Ealing.

In April 1999, a 19-year-old student, Elizabeth Chau, left Thames Valley University and was caught on CCTV walking home along the Uxbridge Road near Ealing police station. She was never seen again.  

Her sister, Bich, has never given up hope of being reunited with her sibling. She said: 'We want Liz to know that we love her and miss her very much.'

Nine months later, in January 2000, Lola Shenkoya, 27, an American-born computer graduate, got off a bus outside Burger King station near Ealing Broadway station. She too disappeared without trace.

Both instances occurred within a few hundred yards of the spot where Alice went missing on August 28.

And the case has struck a chord with former officers who were involved in the incidents of the missing women.

The victims all went missing at busy times of the day and their disappearances went unnoticed by members of the public. 

They told Tom Harper, of the Independent: 'The odds against three girls disappearing or being murdered in such a small area of London, even over a 14-year period, are astronomical.

'Stranger murders on lone young females walking in the street during the day by a man unknown to them are extremely rare occurrences in the UK.

'The vast majority of victims are known to their attackers and any such cases always become big news stories. There are only ever two or three a year nationally, if that.

'Whoever killed these girls showed considerable coolness, sophistication in avoiding being seen during the act, and avoiding capture.

'The killings took place out of sight and sound of the public, as did the subsequent disposal of the bodies. This latter aspect takes considerable planning and coolness on the part of the attacker, raising the question of whether there was more than one attacker.  

'All the above circumstances are extremely rare in any case of murder, let alone in such a small area of London.'  

Alice's body was recovered from the River Brent in west London on Wednesday, a month after she vanished

Former Met Officers said the disappearance of Latvian builder Arnis Zalkalns made him the prime suspect in the inquiry in to Alice's murder

The Met said Chau and Shenkoya were strongly suspected to have been murdered by Andrezej Kanowski, a convicted rapist and murderer from Poland who died in 2009.

Kanowski, known as 'The Beast', was questioned in 2004 but the Met never found any hard evidence against him.  

But officers who were involved in the murder inquiries disputed that claim, although they accepted he was a 'good suspect'.  

Elsewhere, former Met Officers told the Independent that the disappearance of Latvian Zalkalns made him the prime suspect in the inquiry.

The source was also concerned at the delays in contacting Latvian police over Zalkalns' whereabouts, although the police dispute any such delays.

Privately, several retired detectives are shocked it took the Met five days to launch a murder inquiry into Alice's disappearance. 

One said: 'It was an unacceptable delay. A 14-year-old girl should have been classed a high-risk missing person and the murder inquiry should have started after 24 hours - particularly when the police realised her phone was not working.' 

Vital forensic leads may have been lost for ever after it took police more than a month to find Alice's body.

In the hours after Alice's body was found, her family said in a statement: 'We have been left completely devastated by the recent developments and it is difficult to comprehend that our sweet and beautiful daughter was the victim of a terrible crime.

'Why anyone would want to hurt her is something that we are struggling to come to terms with.

'Alice was a loving and much loved daughter and sister, a quirky live spark of a girl, beautiful inside and out. She was a funny companion, a loyal friend, both passionate and compassionate, and so talented with a bright future ahead of her. She brought so much joy to our family and those who knew her.

'We still don't know who is responsible for this crime and we ask that people continue to help the police by giving them information that could help bring the perpetrator to justice.'
