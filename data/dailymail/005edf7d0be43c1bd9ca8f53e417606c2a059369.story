It's not often that 6ft 5in Dwayne Johnson, aka 'The Rock', is made to feel small - but the action movie star was cut down to size on his visit to China.

The Hollywood actor travelled east to promote his  film Hercules, but found time to play a round of miniature golf with the most unlikely of opponents - 7ft 9in basketball player Sun Ming Ming.

Johnson tweeted a picture of his mini-me moment accompanied by the caption: '7'9 Sun Ming Ming - one of the tallest players ever. Great dude and a helluva miniature golfer.'
