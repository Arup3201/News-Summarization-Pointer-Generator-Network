It is back to the drawing board for manager Chris Ramsey after embattled QPR fell to an uninspiring defeat at Crystal Palace.

The west Londoners have just five points to show from their last 12 top-flight matches, putting their Premier League status at serious risk.

Saturday's 3-1 defeat at Selhurst Park was the latest hammer blow, making it four straight defeats after Ramsey last month oversaw Rangers' first away win of the campaign.

Morale had been boosted by that victory but now they are hurtling towards the Championship, with the first-half capitulation against Palace a particular concern.

'We'll go for it as best we can,' Ramsey said, looking ahead to the final nine matches. 'The players are disappointed. They're still unified in what we're trying to do and all we can do is keep fighting.

'The only thing we can do is go back to the drawing board, there's nothing else we can do. I know there are Rangers fans out there whose weekend will have been spoilt by this result.

'They live, die and breath football every weekend, and that's what hurts me the most.'
