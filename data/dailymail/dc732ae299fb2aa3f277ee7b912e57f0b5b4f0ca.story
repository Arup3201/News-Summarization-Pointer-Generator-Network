 A woman has come out of the woodwork to say that she's been sexually harassed when she was 15 by a YouTube celebrity whose video of him groping women on the street has gone viral and she’s not the only one.

The star of the video and former U.K. Big Brother contestant Sam Pepper sparked outrage after a video of him asking women for directions on the street then groping them with a hand hidden beneath a sweatshirt quickly circulated the internet.

Right after the video came out, three women came forward to say that Sam Pepper touched them inappropriately in real life without any cameras to witness their reaction.

Faces serious accusations: Sam Pepper recently went under fire for posting an offensive video to YouTube of him grabbing girls' behinds and since then women have stepped forward to say he sexually assaulted them

On Wednesday a fourth woman came out to say that Sam Pepper tried to solicit nude photos of her in 2011 when she was 15 and he was 22.

Also this week a 20-year-old woman spoke to BuzzFeed and said that she was assaulted by Pepper in 2013 while he was on tour with rapper Sammy Adams and singer Mills.

'I didn’t even know who Sammy Adams was,' she said. 'I just went because my friends, we all really liked that whole YouTube thing at that time and my friends told me about [the concert] and said that [Sam Pepper] would be there.'

She was 18 at the time and she and her 21-year-old sister responded to Sam Pepper on Twitter when he said he was stopping in Toronto and they all exchanged Facebook info.

When she asked if she could have tickets to his show, Pepper said he might be able to get her a backstage pass, but not her older sister and friend, to the show. He also asked her to come to his hotel before the show—alone.

‘I walked into his room, he was sitting on a queen-sized bed watching TV,’ she said.

‘There were two beds in the room, and I had no interest in lying next to him on a bed, so I sat on the other one and began to talk to him.’

He told her to come next to him, and as soon as she did he allegedly pulled down his pants and tried to have sex with her. She didn't want to participate but said that Pepper forced her to perform oral sex on him. She had never been that far with a boy before.

'The most I could blurt out was ‘Well, I can’t have sex with you. Please don’t have sex with me, I don’t do this kind of thing,' she told BuzzFeed.

'Which was true, at this point in my life I had never done anything like this with a boy.'

'He continued to do things to me against my will and then forced me to give him head, nearly choking me,' she said.

'Afterwards, he threw me a napkin and told me that it was time to go.'

 Her worried sister and friend waited for her and when she finally came back downstairs he hair was tousled and  she looked distressed. 

'We were getting really worried and we started to text her,' the woman’s sister told BuzzFeed.

'She came back downstairs and her hair was all a mess and her makeup was running down her face and she just looked so distraught and I knew right away that it wasn’t an innocent thing that had happened.'

When show time came, Pepper only allowed the one girl he allegedly harassed to come inside the venue.  

Another woman who came out is Dottie Martin who says she went on a date with Pepper when she was 16 and that he 'groped her' and made her feel uncomfortable.

She posted a video on YouTube describing her experience.

After the viral video came out, Bryony Harris, 19, of West Sussex in the U.K. tweeted screenshots with someone she claims is Pepper when she was only 15 years old. He was allegedly trying to illicit naked images of her.

Harris said she met Pepper at a signing for Irish X-Factor and the two exchanged Facebook info. He was 22 and she was only 15 at the time. They never met in person but spoke on Skype.

'I know he was much older than me, yes, but at the time it didn’t matter as I was a huge fan and I went along with it,' Harris told BuzzFeed.

'I had pictures of Sam on my wall in my room,' she added.

Cruel: YouTube star Sam Pepper shared a video showing him pinching women's behinds while he is asking them for directions 

'He just asked me to send him pictures of me naked and stuff and go on Skype and I did because I was a child and thought he would meet me,' Harris lamented.

'He was taking advantage of the fact he knew I and many other girls would fangirl over him.'

In his conversations with Harris he allegedly said things to manipulate her like 'well not sure is I'm that into you..you need to convince me.'

After their exchang Sam Pepper allegedly blocked her.

'He turned rude and ignored me and said he can’t carry on talking. He also asked me to delete the conversation,' Harris said. 'He blocked me on Facebook and we haven’t spoken.' 

After the video came out, British prankster Sam Pepper, 25, has since insisted that all the girls in his video were in on the joke and that it was simply to highlight how people have different reactions to assaults on men and women.

But the video, which has since been removed by YouTube, still has viewers in uproar, with some expressing skepticism over whether the girls knew, while others pointed out that he has created other insulting videos, including 'Easiest Way To Get A Number' and 'How to Pick Up Girls with a Lasso'.

Pepper, who has more than two million subscribers on YouTube, posted the video to his account showing him pinching women's bottoms after pretending to ask them for directions.

Shock: The girls in the video look surprised and look around them to see who is responsible for the grope

The women are all shocked, with some looking around them for the culprit, while one clearly says she doesn't like it.

'It’s completely inappropriate. It's against the law, and it just sends the wrong message,' women's advocate Britni Soto told KCAL after the video went viral.  

Fellow YouTube stars also lambasted Pepper for the video.

'Sexually harassing women is vile to begin with, but normalizing it by calling it a prank? So harmful,' Tyler Oakley tweeted. 

The video gained more than 1.3 million views before it was removed by YouTube for violating YouTube's 'Terms of Service'.

Pepper, who first gained fame in the UK after appearing on the country's reality TV show Big Brother in 2010, stayed largely quiet about the scandal until posting about it on Twitter on Monday.

'If you've seen something one way, will it change what you would of thought of it another way?' he wrote, before sharing a similar video showing a woman pinching men's behinds.

Prank: The women look shocked as he pinches them - but he later insisted the girls were all on the prank

Denial: He later posted a video showing women grabbing men's behinds, and on Tuesday he shared this video explaining it had been a social experiment to prove how people regard assaults on men different

This video, which has also been removed by YouTube, sparked some disgust too, but not the same amount as the earlier video, Pepper said.

On Tuesday morning following the posting, he shared one final video to YouTube explaining that the two videos had been part of a social experiment to show our flippant reactions to assaults on men.

He explained that he had been inspired by a male friend who was in an abusive marriage and whose accounts were doubted by police, as well as his own experiences being sexually assaulted by fans.

'At multiple events some of my viewers will grab my bum and giggle about it among their friends,' he said. 'I don't like it. And if the roles were reversed would people think it was OK to pinch a female celebrity?

'I wanted to do something that would highlight the difference between abuse towards a woman and abuse towards a man in a social experiment with you as unwitting participants at the heart of the experiment.'

He added: 'I don't want to turn off a light on a very real and scary issue women face I just want to shine a light on an otherwise dark corner - abuse on men.'

Explanation: On Twitter, he said he could have carried out his plan in a smoother way - but that he was glad that it had made people think about how differently they treat men and women

He added that the videos had all been 'staged and scripted' and thanked the women by name for helping him put them together. 

Some fans applauded Pepper for the series.

'To help out a friend who was afraid to admit he was being abused, @sampepper risked everything he's worked for. So much respect man,' one Twitter user said.

Yet others weren't quite so convinced.

'So were all the other videos where you pressure women to kiss you also 'social experiments' too?' one asked on Twitter.

Pepper added on Twitter on Tuesday: 'In hindsight we would all do things different in our lives, I could have executed this neater, but would have it as reached as many people?'
