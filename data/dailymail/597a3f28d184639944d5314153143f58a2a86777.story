He recently welcomed son Charlton, his second child with wife Ayda Field, and announced his upcoming tour but there's just no rest for pop legend Robbie Williams as he prepares to make his big fashion comeback.

The former Take That singer is preparing to relaunch his 30-piece menswear range, Farrell, at Primark.

Farrell, which was founded by the singer in 2011 and had former Burberry design director Ben Dickens at the helm, ceased trading last October when it filed for voluntary bankruptcy.

Back with a bang: Robbie Williams has re-launched his fashion range, which ceased trading last October, in Primark - and it's inspired by his late grandfather 

Primark has taken the fledgling brand on board and say it is 'superb and amazing value'.

Inspired by his late grandfather Jack Farrell, the  collaboration draws upon Jack’s strong values, timeless style and alluring personality.

Robbie says that Jack’s life as a 'Stoke-on-Trent gentleman' is reflected in the clean, tailored lines and British heritage design. 

Boxing was apparently a guilty pleasure of Jack’s and he spent much of his time teaching Robbie the sport. 

His love of boxing is translated via heavyweight T-shirts, textured sweatshirts and thickly knitted cable jumpers - and there are even tops emblazoned with his name.

In honour: The range, which is priced between £8-£45, is inspired by his grandfather Jack Farrell and aims to draw upon his strong values, timeless style and alluring personality

Thrilled: Robbie says it's amazing to work with Primark and the high street giant say the product is super high quality 

Heritage: The garments are inspired by his grandfather's love of all things British and also pay tribute to his passion for boxing

Influenced and worn by Robbie himself, the 40-year-old says his new capsule collection is built on statement, stand-out pieces that 'define a wardrobe rather than fill it out'. 

There are button down polo shirts, double-breasted pea coats, smart tweed jackets and slim leg tailored jeans, all priced between £8-£45.

Speaking about the launch, Robbie said: ’I’m delighted that Farrell has been invited into Primark. 

'What a great collaboration - let’s have it!'. 

Speaking about breathing new life into the brand, Ben Smith, Director of Menswear, Primark, said: ‘We've absolutely loved working with the Farrell brand. 

The product looks superb with fastidious detail and amazing value and has remained true to its origin.

'Not only have we ensured the product is amazing but the whole concept from quality through to design and store environment have all played a massive part in ensuring we deliver a first class exclusive range to the Primark customer.' 

Coming soon: Robbie recently announced that he will be going on tour next year 

Funny man: Robbie and Ayda welcomed Charlton last month. The baby weighed 8lbs 2oz and Robbie shared videos along the way

The Candy hitmaker recently posted a humorous video to his official account, showing Ayda pushing him and their son in a wheelchair out of hospital and captioned it, 'Charlton Valentine Williams has left the building'.

The couple already have daughter Theodora 'Teddy' Rose Williams, two, together and welcomed Charlton last fortnight, with the tot weighing eight pounds and two ounces.

The video shows Ayda pushing a wheelchair through the hospital, and when she turns the corner, Robbie can be seen sitting in it, with Charlton in his lap.

Robbie shared clips of Ayda's labour on his official YouTube account and later spoke about his 'astonishing' wife.

He said: 'I've never been more in love, and I've never been more proud of my wife. She's been absolutely astonishing.'

Robbie added: 'The universe has presented itself to us again and it's been a very emotional, amazing few hours and we're really happy and honoured that you experienced the journey with us.'

The singer married Ayda in 2010. 

Happily married: The Candy hitmaker and Ayda have two children together and tied the knot back in 2010
