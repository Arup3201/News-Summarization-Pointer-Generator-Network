India opener Rohit Sharma is to miss the remainder of the Royal London Series against England with a broken finger, and will be replaced by Murali Vijay.

Rohit hurt his right middle finger while fielding in India's 133-run victory over England in Cardiff two days ago.

Vijay, who opened throughout India's Test campaign this summer, is to return to the tour as soon as possible as Rohit's replacement for the rest of the five-match one-day international series and then a one-off Twenty20.

India lead 1-0 after two matches, with the third ODI taking place at Trent Bridge on Saturday.
