When exterminators were called to the home of a 98-year-old woman in Florida they were told she had rats in her attic.

But when they investigated they found both rats and squirrels feasting on the honey made by a colony of 30,000 bees.

Incredibly Sevia Moore said she had no idea the huge nest was up there and said the buzzing insects 'didn't bother her'.

Exterminators called to grandmother Sevia Moore's Florida home found a colony of 30,000 bees in her attic along with rats and squirrels which she had failed to notice (file picture)

Speaking to NBC News near her Cocoa Beach home, the grandmother added: 'When I'm in my garden, I don't even see them.'

Expressing her shock at the discovery, Moore's granddaughter Laura Blevins commented: 'Sleeping under that - oh Lord.'

Leo Cross, the founder of Florida Wildlife Trappers, who Ms Moore called, estimated that the colony had been there for about a year.

Average colony sizes range between 20,000 and 100,000 insects, but are at a low point during the autumn and winter months, meaning there could have been many thousands more just a few months earlier.

Cross and a colleague had to use a vacuum to clear away thousands of the stinging insects before they could lay traps to catch scores of rodents which had been eating the hive.

The pest controllers had to vacuum up thousands of the insects before they could lay traps for the rats, and say that they will probably have to return to lay more (file picture)

Cross said : 'The rats and squirrels were probably up there having a good time with the honeycombs.

'It's pretty mind-boggling not to notice that you have a beehive of that size upstairs.'

As bees are vital to the environment and the population is in decline, the hive will not be destroyed, but moved to another area instead.

Cross expects to pay more visits to Moore's house in coming days, as he and his associate expect there are "a couple dozen" more rats and squirrels cavorting in the attic.

'Rats reproduce every few days, so this job is ongoing,' he said.

Wasps and bees will nest wherever they can find shelter and warmth, making attic spaces particularly attractive to them, especially if they are not used often.

The insects can crawl through the smallest of holes before they begin to build their nests using their sharp mandibles to chew away wood beams or plasterboard which they then use as a building material.

A common sign that there is an infestation is a golf-ball sized hole, often found just underneath guttering which will act as an entrance to a hive, or a crackling sound coming from a wall or ceiling.

Contrary to popular belief hives will not 'buzz' unless disturbed, as the bees inside will be crawling, rather than flying.

If a nest is discovered then people are advised not to tackle it themselves, as stings can be very painful and even lead to death in very high numbers.

Instead call the local authorities who can arrange for the hive to be taken away, or a local beekeeper who can rehouse the colony.

It is important that the nests aren't destroyed as roughly one third of commercial honeybee hives died off in the US last winter alone, meaning there are barely enough to pollinate crops.

Bees are though to add roughly $10billion to the economy every year.
