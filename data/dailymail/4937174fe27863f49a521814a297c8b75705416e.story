At its peak, it was a bustling town manufacturing millions of wooden doors to cater for the housing boom in Spain.

But all that’s left now is a ghost town with an abandoned factory that is a stark reminder of more prosperous times.

Villacanas is one of the many former buoyant industrial Spanish towns that is now struggling with huge unemployment problems.

Stark: The sun rises over Villacanas, 55 miles from Madrid. At its peak, it was a buoyant manufacturing town making millions of wooden doors

Abandoned: The terrain of the Mavisa door factory is strewn with rubbish. During the boom years, the factory employed 5,700 people and produced seven million wooden doors a year

Destroyed: Material is scattered around an old working bench inside the abandoned Mavisa door factory. Since its closure, the town of Villacanas has been struggling with huge unemployment problems

Between 2001 and 2007, Spain was leading the property boom in Europe with prices increasing annually at an average of around 13 per cent.

Around 800,000 houses were being built a year and the people of Villacas were part of Spain’s middle class enjoying high wages and permanent jobs.

During the construction boom, the majority of doors used with the new developments were made in this small industrial town.

Approximately seven million doors a year were once assembled at the Mavisa factory which employed a workforce of almost 5,700 people.

Desolate: The state of the Mavisa door factory is a stark reminder of more prosperous times when the population of Villacanas was part of Spain's middle class enjoying high wages and permanent jobs

Bleak outlook: A man crosses an old bridge leading to the other side of the railroad track in Villacanas. Times now are different from the boom years when Spain was building some 800,000 houses a year

Shutting up shop: A market salesman packs up his unsold vegetables after a day on the local market

Empty: A neon sign illuminates on a bar in Calle Mayor. The town has been left desolate with the Villacanas industrial park now empty and redundant

Quiet: A pedestrian crosses the street devoid of traffic. With Spain in the grip of recession and the housing bubble burst, Villacanas is typical of many former buoyant industrial Spanish towns now struggling with huge problems

Then the economic downturn hit in 2008.

The Spanish government estimates that over 780,000 houses built since 2005 have not been sold.

The housing bubble has burst and the country is in the grip of recession.

Meanwhile, the town has been left almost desolate with the Villacanas industrial park now empty and redundant.

The town is reminiscent of the country’s situation as a whole.

The unemployment rate in Spain stands at 25 per cent with more than half of young people out of work

Between July and September 2012, 85,000 more people joined the ranks of the unemployed raising the total to 5.78 million, according to the National Statistics Institute.

Scraps: Two men drag unfinished doors behind them, to be used as burning wood for their stoves at home, on the terrain of the abandoned Mavisa door factory

A helping hand: A Red Cross worker arranges boxes with biscuits while unemployed Spaniards (right) wait in line for a food hand out inside a Red Cross post

Deserted: The Mavisa door factory is pictured it its derelict state with materials scattered everywhere. Since the economic downturn hit in 2008, the housing bubble has burst and the government estimates that over 780,000 houses built since 2005 have not been sold

Forlorn: A couple strolls along Calle Mayor in Villacanas. Across Spain, some 800,000 people have lost their jobs over the past year

For those under 25, the unemployment rate is at 52 per cent.

Over the past 12 months some 800,000 people have lost their jobs, proving that the economic crisis is tightening its grip on the country.

Spain is under pressure to ask for outside aid to help deal with its debts. The country is in its second recession in three years.

It has already been granted a 100 billion Euro bailout for its troubled banks while many of its regional governments are also in bad financial shape.

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's government, which pledged to reduce unemployment in its electoral campaign last year, has introduced austerity measures and financial and labour reforms to convince investors it has a grip on its accounts but they have yet to show any positive effect on the economy.

Distraught: Laid off workers who used to work at the Artevi door factory stand around a fire to stay warm during a picket to prevent machinery leaving the factory

Cutting a lonely figure: A man plays his guitar trying to make money on an empty Plaza Mayor

Eerie: Villacanas is reminiscent of Spain's current situation. The unemployment rate stands at 25 per cent and more than half of young people are out of work

Organisations such as the Spanish Red Cross and the Catholic Church charity organisation Caritas say unemployment and the austerity measures are leaving tens of thousands of people in need of food and financial help.

There are now 1.8million households in Spain in which no one has work.

And, it is the once-booming construction sector that has been the worst hit, with 56,100 fewer jobs.
