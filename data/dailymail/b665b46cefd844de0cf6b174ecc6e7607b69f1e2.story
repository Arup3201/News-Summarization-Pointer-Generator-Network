Hull have enquired about Blackburn Rovers striker Rudy Gestede. The 26-year-old has also been the subject of interest from West Brom. 

Bruce looks set to miss out on former Tottenham striker Jermain Defoe, who is set to move to Sunderland, as his search for a striker continues. 

Hull also have interest in Sunderland's target man Steven Fletcher and Maritimo left-back Ruben Ferreira after Andy Robertson picked up an injury. 

26-year-old has scored 12 goals for Blackburn so far this season and has attracted the interest of Hull City

Hull City will find out on Thursday how much they have to pay Blackpool for winger Tom Ince. 

The clubs are due to meet at a tribunal with Blackpool looking for £4m for the 22-year-old who was out of contract when he signed.

Ince has returned to Steve Bruce's squad following a short loan spell at Championship side Nottingham Forest, making four appearances for The Tigers since Boxing Day. 

Sunderland striker Steven Fletcher, who has only scored four goals this season, is a target for Hull

Tom Ince joined Hull in the summer on a free transfer after leaving Blackpool at the end of his contract
