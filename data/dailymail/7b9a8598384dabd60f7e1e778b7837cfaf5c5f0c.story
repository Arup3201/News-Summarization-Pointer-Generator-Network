It’s also reported that Lee refused to take a breath test which was when he was taken into custody and was held for over 12 hours.

A Met Police spokesperson told The Sun: ‘Police stopped a car after officers witnessed it being driven erratically. The driver was arrested on suspicion of drink driving and taken into custody.

‘He was subsequently further arrested on suspicion of possession of Class A drugs and criminal damage.’

Started so well: Lee started his night with bandmate Duncan James and their trainer friend Scott Ashley at Core bar

Just hours earlier Lee had been seen partying at the opening of Core bar in London alongside Duncan and their personal trainer pal Scott Ashley.

A spokesperson for Lee issued MailOnline with the following statement: 'I can confirm that Lee was arrested in the early hours of Friday morning. He was arrested on suspicion of drink driving and is awaiting a court date.

'He was charged with failure to provide a specimen and criminal damage. A controlled substance was found in his possession. They added: 'This low point has caused considerable concern to Lee’s family, loved ones and of course the Blue boys. Worried about his recent erratic behaviour, management have now intervened and taken appropriate action.

'No excuses will be made on Lee’s behalf, but he will be seeking professional help for those issues that he has been unable to overcome on his own.'

Unhappy: According to reports the singer peed all over his police cell which led to him being arrested again

Lee was previously banned from driving and was fined £2,250 as a consequence of drunk driving in 2003.

On
 31 December 2007, he was arrested for an assault on a taxi driver in 
Oxted, Surrey. He was released on bail until February 2008. At Guildford
 Magistrates' Court on 24 June 2008 he was fined £300. He claimed in 
court ‘he felt targeted because he is 'famous' .’

In August of 2010, Ryan was charged with assault after allegedly hitting his then fiancee Samantha Millar. The charges were later dropped, and the couple separated.

Lee, who hit headlines again recently due to being involved in a love triangle on CBB, is due to perform with is band Blue at a number of gigs in Europe next week.

A spokesperson for Lee has been contacted for comment.  The Met Police were unavailable for comment.
