Graham Norton plunged his BBC Radio 2 show into turmoil yesterday when he failed to show up.

The Irish star's production team had to struggle on with the three-hour programme when he didn't make the 10am start.

However, Norton seems to have recovered quickly, as he was seen walking his dogs in the early afternoon. The evening before the show he attended a party with TV chef Nigella Lawson.

Maria McErlane, the co-presenter of the programme's Grill Graham problem spot, ended up carrying much of show on her own.

Veteran disc jockey Tony Blackburn, 71, even had to step in to help during the first hour of the show.

McErlane said on-air: 'Fear not, Graham isn't taking hormones. It's Maria McErlane, his old mucker.

'I'm standing in because I fear he has been delayed slightly. But fear not he will be here.'

Anxious fans only found out the Eurovision Song Contest presenter had 'been up all night being sick' two hours into the show.

The failure to explain Norton's absence led to speculation online that the 51-year-old had gone to Glastonbury or yesterday's Gay Pride in London.

But The Mail on Sunday spotted Norton out walking his dogs yesterday lunch time close to his home in Wapping, east London.

The presenter said: 'I'm OK thanks,' when approached by a reporter.

Today a BBC spokesman said: 'Graham is unwell and won't be presenting his show today.'

Worried fans were quick to post messages on Twitter voicing their concerns about the Irish television star.

Twitter user Paul Martin posted: 'Graham Norton doesn't show for his R2 show this morning and some confusion in the studio. Is he at Gay Pride by any chance?'

Anne Ayres said: '@grahnort - where are you Graham? Only one more week of you on a Saturday & these mornings won't be same, now we don't have u this week.'

Yolande Biggs added: '@grahnort hope you're OK Graham, missing you :('

Twitter user Kev The Bear said: 'Where is @grahnort ? Has he decided to bunk off work to rave it up at Â£PrideinLondon?'
