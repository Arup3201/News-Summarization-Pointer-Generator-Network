Beleaguered NBC anchor Brian Williams could have exaggerated another near-death story involving himself - this time from a stint covering Israel's 2006 war with Hezbollah.

Williams seemingly embellished an account of a helicopter ride with Israeli Defense Force officials to imply he was almost hit by a rocket, when in fact he was nowhere near enemy fire.

The potentially pumped-up claims came a little more than a year after the event, when Williams recounted a slew of now-doubtful anecdotes about his time in the midst of mortal danger.

Rockets 'just underneath': Williams said he was 'lucky to survive' this helicopter flight, and claimed rockets were just underneath the vehicle

Looking for danger: Williams implied he was in danger during the 2006 flight near Haifa, Israel - but in an NBC report he wrote, he mentioned only ground operations beneath them, and a rocket fired from six miles away

It came amid claims that NBC bosses had been told about Williams' alleged track record of puffing up stories, and were baffled by the habit. 

Williams told a student reporter he was 'lucky to survive' the helicopter ride, organized by the Israeli military to give his NBC news crew an aerial perspective of the conflict, near the city of Haifa.

In a recorded interview ahead of a speaking engagement at Fairfield University, Connecticut, he told how rockets whizzed by 'just underneath' the Blackhawk he was riding in with an Israeli general.

However, a broadcast segment he himself filmed that day makes no mention of being inches from death, only mentioning plumes of smoke and a rocket he saw fired six miles away.

If you squint: This footage, shot from the chopper, shows distant rocket fire over Israel. Williams's past reports are under intense scrutiny since he admitted embellishing an anecdote from his time in Iraq

In a Youtube video, he told a report for the student-run News 64 channel: 'I have been very lucky to survive a few things. I tend to forget the war with Hezbollah in Israel a few years back.

'There were Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in.'

However, the fleeting reference does not tally with his own NBC report, dated July 18, 2006.

There he states that the chopper was 1,500ft in the air, and that the four-star general on board with him mentioned that there was ground-based activity directly below them.

He continued: 'Then, I noticed something out the window. From a distance of six miles, I witnessed a rocket launch.

'A rising trail of smoke, then a second rocket launch, an orange flash and more smoke — as a rocket heads off toward Israel.'

He does not suggest that the rocket came anywhere near him.

The seemingly conflicting accounts, uncovered by the Washington Post, emerged after Williams backed out of anchoring NBC's flagship Nightly News show.

It came after it was claimed that NBC executives were tipped off about Williams's behavior, but did not know how to rein him in.

On the scene: Williams is pictured above posing with a soldier in Iraq. Veterans of that war called him out on his overblown anecdotes

New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote that news bosses were told last year his claims sometimes did not stack up, and that his tendency to exaggerate had become 'a joke' among NBC staffers.

Over the weekend Williams backed off from the anchor's chair for an unspecified length of time after a firestorm over another helicopter anecdote he had been repeating for years - this time in Iraq.

Williams issued an on-air apology after saying he was on board a helicopter which was downed after being hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, when he was in fact on a different one.

Some days later, after intense criticism of that anecdote and others, he withdrew from presenting the news.

He said: 'In the midst of a career spent covering and consuming news, it has become painfully apparent to me that I am presently too much a part of the news, due to my actions.

'As Managing Editor of NBC Nightly News, I have decided to take myself off of my daily broadcast for the next several days... 

'Upon my return, I will continue my career-long effort to be worthy of the trust of those who place their trust in us.' 

In the Fairfield interview, Williams also grabs the opportunity to give his Iraqi anecdote an outing.

Currently off the air after he admitted to lying about being hit by enemy fire in Iraq, a number of Williams' other seemingly outlandish claims are currently coming under increased scrutiny

Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s

In a 2011 interview Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. However in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams had claimed to save not one but two puppies.

In the same Esquire interview Williams also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up. 

A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone ‘stuck a .38-caliber in my face.’

Iraq War, 2003

Over the years Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an army Chinook during the Iraq War in 2003. 

Last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present. 

Williams issued an on air apology. ‘Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor,’ he wrote on Facebook.

Hurricane Katrina, 2005

Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans. 

He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded. 

The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the floodwaters and that his hotel was ‘overrun’ with gangs, have been called into question by others who were there.

Israel, 2006

In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled ‘Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in.’ 

In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described a helicopter under fire a distance away.

Boston, 2006

A navy vet has accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the armed forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live. 

On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update.

Backed off: Williams, seen above in his broadcast from Friday, has backed off from the anchor's chair since criticism mounted

He said: 'A few years before that you go back to Iraq and I looked down the tube of an RPG that had been fired at us and it hit the chopper in front of ours.

'And I'm so fortunate to be sitting here.'

Though this version of the story does not place Williams inside the under-fire vehicle, it does imply that he was right next to the action.

Veterans who were riding in the chopper, which managed to land after the RPG round did not explode, have since said Williams's helicopter was not following them, and was nothing to do with their mission.

In fact, they said, he was around half an hour behind, and only found out about the brush with death after he had landed.
