At least 17 people, including two children, were injured at a sports car rally in the Polish city of Poznan after a luxury vehicle skidded into a group of spectators.

At least four people are reportedly seriously injured following the crash, which happened just seconds after the driver pulled away from the start.

The accident occurred at the beginning of the three-day Gran Turismo Polonia event which draws amateur motor enthusiasts from all over Europe. At least 150 luxury cars are taking part in the event.
