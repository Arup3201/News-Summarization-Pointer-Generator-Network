Travelers who attempt to make a joke about strict security procedures at airports have been warned they face arrest.

A loudspeaker announcement made by the Transport Security Administration warns the public: 'Any inappropriate remarks or jokes concerning security may result in your arrest.'

Concerned passenger Matt Miller recorded the loudspeaker message while passing through George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas.

In the recording a female voices on the public address system says: 'Pay particular attention to your luggage. Any unintended luggage will, and personal belongings may be treated as a danger to the facility.

'Do not be persuaded by strangers or individuals you do not know very well to take articles aboard your flight.

'You are also reminded that any inappropriate remarks or jokes concerning security may result in your arrest.

'We appreciate your cooperation while these measures are in effect.'

It is unclear if this message is being broadcast at any other airport in the U.S.

But the agency has now been accused of trampling over the constitutional right of free expression.

The tape recording was posted on American radio host, author, conspiracy theorist Alex Jone's website Infowars.com, which branded the warning 'unlawful
 and illegitimate violation of the First Amendment', adding that it was 
'designed to intimidate travelers and stop them from complaining about 
aggressive grope downs'. 

The recording was made by Police State USA

The
 agency has also faced accusations of over-zealously imposing search 
procedures on  passengers while also missing potentially serious 
security breaches. 

It has also been beset by a series of damaging or embarrassing stories which appeared over the past year.

A
 nine-year-old boy from Minneapolis was able to evade TSA security 
checkpoints to hop a Las Vegas-bound Delta jet without a ticket on 
October 2.

Earlier this year, an undercover inspector managed to get 
through a security checkpoint at Newark Airport with an improvised 
explosive device stuffed down his pants.

Meanwhile, it offered an apology to a 
Missouri family after one of their agents detained their 
wheelchair-bound three-year-old daughter.

In March, an airport security worker 
who discovered a container of pepper spray at JFK sprayed five of his 
colleagues with the chemical as he was 'playing around' with the 
canister.

All six TSA screeners were taken to hospital, and security 
checks at JFK were said to have been held up for at least 15 minutes 
following the incident in Terminal 2.

A former Newark TSA screener also went public with claims his co-workers were lazy, 
inept, and absolute failures at stopping security threats in a shocking 
interview.

Rep Duncan Hunter (R-California) wrote a terse letter to the 
Transportation Security Administrator asking why a double-amputee Marine
 was forced to remove his prosthetic legs and later had to stand on them
 without the use of his wheelchair.

TSA has fired back with their own 
account, saying that initial CCTV footage shows Cpl Gaal passing through
 the security checkpoint at Arizona’s Phoenix Sky Harbor International 
Airport without removing his prostheses.

U.S. travelers may be facing extended wait times in airports across the
 country as a result of sequestration, but that did not stop the 
Transportation Security Administration from paying tens of millions of 
dollars for officers' uniforms.
