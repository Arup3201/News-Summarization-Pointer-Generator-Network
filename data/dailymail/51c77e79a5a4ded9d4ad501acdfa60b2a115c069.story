From a dainty Japanese teahouse perched in a grove of cherry trees to an elegant modernist cabin in Belgium, today's treehouses are a world away from the father-fabricated efforts of childhood.

No surprise then, that the new breed of treehouse has proven even more popular with adults than with children as Architectural Digest revealed when it unveiled the world's best treehouses.

So cool are the new breed of treehouse, they've even merited their own design book: Tree Houses. Fairy Tale Castles in the Air by Phillip Jodido (£44.99, Taschen). 

Included in both is the Honey Sphere, owned by Doors guitarist Robby Krieger. After being exhibited at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the red wood and steel latticed sphere was installed at Krieger's Beverley Hills home, where he apparently uses it to sit back, relax and write music.

Home: The Lake Tree House in Araras, Brazil, boasts two bedrooms, a spectacular lakeside setting and even has a separate tree office (pictured left)

More traditional is the red cedar Suite Bleue at La Piantata Bed & Breakfast in Lazio, Italy, which was made by French specialists, La Cabane Perchée and installed atop a centuries old oak tree.

Another, the Lake Tree House in the town of Araras in Brazil, sits at the edge of a spectacular lake and boasts two floors and a separate children's retreat. Designed by Casa na Árvore, the two-bedroom home was constructed from local timber and built around an Australian eucalyptus tree.

Elsewhere, there's the Treehotel near Luleå in Northern Sweden, which boasts not one but seven extraordinary treehouses. The best known is the Mirrorcube, designed by architects Tham & Videgård, and complete with a roof terrace and an interior packed with furniture by Finnish architect Alvar Aalto.

Another super specimen is The Blue Cone, where the scarlet tiled exterior conceals slick Swedish design within. There's even a UFO-inspired design created by architect Bertil Harström which bears a close resemblance to a flying saucer and looks completely unearthly in its pretty forest surroundings.

Now you see it... The spectacular Mirrorcube was designed by Swedish architects Tham & Videgård while the stylish interior was kitted out with furniture by Alvar Aalto

Standout: Despite being just 40 miles short of the Arctic Circle, the SandellSandberg designed 'Blue Cone' room at the Treehotel proves style is not in short supply

Perhaps the most unearthly of all though is the stunning Teahouse Tetsu at the Kiyoharu Shirakaba Museum in the Japanese city of Hokuto.

Perched atop a cypress base in a gorgeous grove of pink-petalled cherry trees, the Terunobu Fujimori-designed teahouse looks as if it sprang direct from the imagination of Hans Christian Andersen and even has a fairytale-style crooked chimney.

Also in Japan is the amazing Gajumaru Treehouse Diner, which serves up classic Okinawan fare from its perch at the top of a gnarled old tree overlooking Naha Harbour.

Equally extraordinary but with a distinctly tropical feel is the Big Beach House in the Sky which is set in a Tamarind tree on the island of Hainan just off the coast of China.

Designed by Treehouses of Hawaii's David Greenberg, the 'shack' shouts Caribbean cool, despite its precarious perch and views of the jade green South China Sea.

But you don't have to travel to Scandinavia, China or Japan to get your design fix. Much closer to home is the eco-friendly modernist effort in the town of Hechtel-Eksel in Belgium's Limberg region. Designed by German architects Baumraum, it has two cabins, a technology room, a pantry and a bath.

Equally
 modernist is the latticed 4Treehouse next to Lake Muskoka in Ontario. 
Designed by Lukasz Kos of Toronto architects Four O Nine, the 
spectacular lantern-shaped building boasts three floors and is supported
 by airline cables.

Also in Canada is the HemLoft, a striking wooden sphere hidden in one of the hemlock trees close to the village of Whistler in British Columbia. According to creator, carpenter Joel Allen, anyone who manages to spot it is welcome to drop in and enjoy the oak-lined interior.

Canada is also home to the spectacular Free Spirit Spheres treehotel in Vancouver Island, where creator Tom Chudleigh has built a series of delicate wood and fibreglass spheres, complete with luxuriously large beds, and suspended them from pine trees.

But not every spectacular treehouse is for adults. The lovely offering at Camp Twin Lakes in Georgia was designed to be accessible to disabled children by architect Amy Leathers.

Complete with special ramps, the treehouse boasts a green roof and skylights, as well as a child-friendly slide and trap doors. 'It’s a totally awesome place for kids to just hang out and play,' said Camp Twin Lakes executive director Eric Robbins.

'It allows for both structured and non-structured play, it sits in the most beautiful part of our camp and has become our centrepiece. Our children cherish the opportunity to hang out there and be with their friends at camp.'

Can you find it? The creator of the HemLoft, carpenter Joel Allen, has hidden the treehouse somewhere near Whistler in British Columbia

Just
 for children: This lovely treehouse is to be found at Camp Twin Lakes 
in Georgia which caters for disabled children. It has wheelchair ramps 
as well as fun slides
