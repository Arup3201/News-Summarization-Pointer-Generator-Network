What price to watch the world’s best two players in competition on English soil? We will probably find out when Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi descend Old Trafford for an international friendly with more stars than Matthew McConaughey encounters in Interstellar.

You needn’t trawl across galaxies to see these wonders either; Manchester calls on November 18 as Portugal face Argentina. Prices start from £40 per ticket. Seems decent value for such a rare spectacle.

Ronaldo heads back to the stadium he graced for six years for the first time since he ejected Manchester United from the Champions League in April 2013.

His goal for Real Madrid proved to be the last conceded by a side managed by Sir Alex Ferguson in Europe’s elite competition. If he scores this time you can expect the celebrations to be a little more celebratory.

Messi is a familiar foe, but only once before have English observers been able to see these two pre-eminent practitioners in direct opposition without leaving the country.

They were on the same Old Trafford pitch in April 2008 when a Paul Scholes rocket separated the teams and sent United on the path to Champions League glory.

Between them, Messi and Ronaldo have won the last six Ballon d’Or prizes – in both guises – and share 35 major honours, including five Champions League titles.

Argentina won the last match these nations played, a friendly in at the Stade de Geneve in Switzerland in February 2011, when Messi scored a last minute penalty to render Ronaldo’s goal meaningless. Angel di Maria also scored.

Argentina striker Carlos Tevez will play at West Ham - where he was an immediate hero in 2007 - again

Tevez is fresh from scoring a wonder solo goal during Juventus' 7-0 win against Parma at the weekend

Ronaldo is back on the ground where he scored (and didn't celebrate) in the Champions League in 2013

Real Madrid's James Rodriguez is the standout star in a promising Colombia team 

Nani is another with United links likely to feature, as is Carlos Tevez, although his warmest greeting should be found on Wednesday night, when Argentina play Croatia at Upton Park.

Tevez became a cult hero at West Ham for keeping the club in the Premier League during his controversial spell in 2006-07.

Tevez has been recalled to the Argentina squad by coach Gerardo Martino for the first time in nearly three-and-a-half-years after scoring a wonderful goal in Juventus’s 7-0 demolition of Parma at the weekend.

Tevez has good memories of Old Trafford - not least for saving West Ham from relegation in 2007 

Pepe and Ronaldo must first turn attentions to a Euro 2016 qualifying game against Armenia 

It will be Tevez’s first game back at Upton Park since appearing for Manchester City in a 0-0 draw in November 2012. Barcelona midfielder Javier Mascherano is also likely to play.

For Croatia, Real Madrid playmaker Luka Modric, Atletico Madrid striker Mario Mandzukic and Messi’s Barcelona team-mate Ivan Rakitic all expected to be involved.

Colombia face USA at Crave Cottage on Friday with World Cup golden boot winner James Rodriguez in tow. He leads a country that earned admirers in Brazil, and includes Porto’s Jackson Martinez. Radamel Falcao has not been included in the squad because of injury, however.
