On his office door at West Ham’s rather modest training ground, Sam Allardyce’s coaching staff have placed a small photocopied sign. It reads: Ufficio del Direttore.

It’s Italian for ‘Manager’s Office’ and is a play on Allardyce’s quip that foreign coaches get a little more respect in the Barclays Premier League than those born in the UK.

What is more important now, though, is that the sign was only stuck on with Blu-Tack. As the summer approaches, Allardyce and West Ham are about to part company.

Given the boot: Sam Allardyce will be sacked by West Ham after a disappointing season at Upton Park

Not a good fit: Relative success has only been giving Allardyce time, as the fans haven't taken to his style

Nobody who has followed West Ham’s season will be surprised. The East London club and their boss from the Black Country have looked like an uncomfortable fit for some time.

West Ham will end the season as a Premier League club, having beaten Tottenham home and away in the league and also in the Capital One Cup. They should move to the Olympic Stadium as an established top-flight club, having been in the Championship when Allardyce took over three years ago.

It could be argued that every season has been a success — one promotion and two steady years in the top flight. That has proved insufficient at West Ham, a club where supporters have taken to booing when their team win.

At Upton Park, they don’t like Allardyce’s football. He arrived in the summer of  2011 vowing  to play the game in the club’s traditions, and for large periods has not been able to do it sufficiently.

His football is built on clean sheets. When West Ham won four out of five in the league to land Allardyce February’s Manager of the Month award, his team conceded just one goal.

At West Ham, that will get you grudging respect and buy you time. It won’t make you admired, and certainly won’t get you any thanks. After all, who wants 1-0 when 4-3 is an option?

Office problems: Sam Allardyce's office is a Portakabin... yet Hammers fans expect big continental managers

It’s strange thinking but it’s the way it is. West Ham are a modest club who think they’re a big club.

The manager’s office at Chadwell Heath is a Portakabin with temporary heating. The club’s fans think they should be able to open the door and find Pep Guardiola sitting there.

One day, if they remain in the Premier League through the teething years of the new stadium, West Ham’s punters may get their wish. The club have a loyal, enthusiastic and knowledgeable support that can help West Ham grow if they can build a team capable of winning things and gaining European football.

If and when that happens, they should remember the part Allardyce played. Some fans believe his decision to field weak teams in cup games against Manchester City and Nottingham Forest was unforgivable. They felt the sacrifice of cup chances at the altar of the Premier League took pragmatism a step too far and it felt like a tipping point in the relationship.

The fact Allardyce’s team  conceded 14 goals in those three cup games embarrassed him.Nevertheless, West Ham, more than most, are a club who simply cannot get relegated, not now, not with a stadium move on the horizon. A return to the Championship would have been more catastrophic than a romantic Wembley final.

Says it all: The scoreboard at the end of the game, giving West Ham no chance in the second leg

Allardyce’s squad was holed with injuries in January, and in sacrificing those cup games, he gave his senior players the chance to begin February’s league run that has kept the club in the top division. Some may call it good management. Others suggest it’s too cautious.

Last season, his team finished on 46 points; they have 40 ahead of Sunday’s visit to City. That’s a stick he can be beaten with and there have been days at Upton Park this season when entertainment has been thin.

Injuries left Allardyce without two key attacking weapons — Stewart Downing and Andy Carroll — and an inability to tame Ravel Morrison saw him join QPR on loan. Aimless football towards Carroll didn’t lend West Ham a progressive air, and recently Allardyce has looked like a man who knew he was never going to satisfy those who pay their money every week.

His departure will sadden him but not surprise him. He loved the job, had bought into it by relocating to East London, and when I saw him a few days after a win at Spurs in October, he seemed as invigorated as ever.

Experience tells you when things aren’t right, though, and Allardyce perhaps always knew his shelf life at a club who still like to close their eyes and pretend it is 1966 was going to be relatively short.Still 59, he would appear to have at least one more prominent job in him. West Ham feel they will be better served without him in the Ufficio del Direttore. Time will tell.
