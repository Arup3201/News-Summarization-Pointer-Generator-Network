The Prince of Wales has made an impassioned and personal plea to stop plastic being dumped in the oceans.

Charles said that he was ‘haunted’ and ‘horrified’ by the issue which needed to be solved for the sake of future generations.

‘Speaking as a grandfather with a new grandchild due to appear in this world in a month’s time, I think we probably owe it to everyone else’s grandchildren to grasp that solution,’ he said.

The prince was addressing a conference in Washington DC at the start of a tour of the US with the Duchess of Cornwall.

‘One issue that we absolutely cannot ignore is that of the increasing quantity of plastic waste in the marine environment,’ he said.

‘I was horrified to learn that, according to recent research, we collectively allow as much as eight million tonnes of plastic to enter the oceans every year.

‘Today, almost half of all marine mammals now have plastic in their gut and I know I am not the only person haunted by the tragic images of seabirds, particularly albatrosses, that have been found dead, washed up on beaches after mistaking a piece of plastic for a meal.’

Prince Charles remained positive, saying there was a solution to the problem caused by the ‘throw-away society’. 

He said we had to move quicker to a circular economy – whereby ‘materials are recovered, recycled and reused instead of created, used and then thrown away’.

The conference was attended by David Miliband, former foreign secretary and co-chairman of the Global Ocean Commission, which helped stage the event.

Since 2008, the Mail has campaigned to get rid of plastic bags, many of which make their way into landfill and oceans.

The Banish the Bag campaign secured a major victory in June last year when a 5p charge for plastic bags was announced in England. 

The charge, which will be introduced by October, is expected to reduce bag use by up to 80 per cent and raise up to £100million a year for good causes, including a raft of green clean-up groups that tackle litter in green spaces, rivers and beaches.

Similar charging schemes in Ireland have led to a fall of around 90 per cent in the distribution of the bags.

Environmental campaigners say the carriers, each used for just 20 minutes on average, take up to 1,000 years to degrade.

In the meantime, they blight the environment and many are ingested by wildlife, in particular marine mammals and sea birds which can suffer lingering deaths as a result.

As well as the serious harm to wildlife, they blight Britain’s coastline, with some 70 bags littering every mile.

The Prince and Duchess arrived in Washington DC for a three-day visit to the country on Tuesday night.

First they visited monuments to President Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jnr in the heart of the capital city.

At King’s memorial they were joined by leading figures from the US civil rights movement, including Jesse Jackson and Congressman John Lewis, who organised the famous Selma march in 1965 which has recently been dramatised in the Oscar-nominated movie Selma.

As they climbed the steps to Lincoln’s memorial, Charles told a well-wisher that he was ‘trying to work out at the moment’.
