A classic Aston Martin DBS which featured in hit television show The Persuaders is expected to sell for £550,000 when it goes under the hammer.

Roger Moore, who played aristocratic Lord Brett Sinclair in the 1971 show, could often be spotted driving around in the bright yellow customised sports car.

The Persuaders, which also featured Moore’s super-rich playboy side-kick Danny Wilde, played by Tony Curtis, was the most expensive show of its time with production taking place in various glamorous locations.

While Tony Curtis preferred his orange Ferrari, Moore insisted on having an Aston Martin DBS – which the British car maker happily supplied.

The yellow motor was customised for the show and instead of having a V8 engine, Aston Martin gave the DBS a four-litre straight-six in orange.

The factory then added V8 wheels, hubs and V8 badging to the Aston Martin.

Developing around 285bhp, the aggressive looking DBS was capable of 0-60mph in 7.1 seconds and a top speed of 140mph.

The car had personalised number plates of Lord Brett Sinclair's initials, 'BS 1', in every episode - except for one scene in the episode The Gold Napoleon where the car had its original UK registration number PPP 6H instead.

The show ran for 24 episodes before Moore was snapped up to play James Bond.

During this period, the Aston Martin covered 5,000 miles and ‘took some punishment’, with Aston Martin servicing the car and selling it on to its next owner.

The car has since had five owners and has spent the past three years appearing at some of the world's most prestigious automotive shows including the 2013 Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este at Lake Como, Italy.

The DBS has now been secured by auctioneers Bonhams ahead of its annual Aston Martin sale, which takes place on May 17 in Newport Pagnell.

It is expected to sell for a whopping £550,000 when it goes under the hammer.

Bonhams described the Aston as ‘a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire a true automotive icon which is also of popular cultural significance’.

Tim Schofield, from the auction house, added: ‘It is one of the most instantly recognisable cars from TV.

‘The car is in wonderful condition, it was restored around 20 years ago by Aston Martin and has been beautifully maintained.

‘The car is attached to a well-known personality and TV show and we are expecting a lot of interest in it.’

Both Roger Moore and Tony Curtis featured in the hit television show The Persuaders

The Persuaders was a hit action/adventure television show which aired during 1971 and 1972.

It followed the lives of Lord Brett Sinclair (played by Roger Moore) and Danny Wilde (Tony Curtis) who reluctantly teamed up to solve cases which the courts were unable to.

The pair were from very different backgrounds with Sinclair being a British aristocrat, a former British Army officer and ex-racing car driver, and Wilde having endured a tough childhood while growing up in New York City.

The show was famed for its unusual ‘split-screen’ title sequence which depicted the lives and background of both characters in the form of ‘case-files’.

It was said to be specifically designed so that neither actor would appear to have top billing, something both Moore and Curtis stipulated when they agreed to co-star.

The ITV show ran for 24 episodes between 17 September 1971 and 25 February 1972 before Roger Moore was snapped up to play James Bond. It wasn’t renewed for another series.

It was filmed in France, Italy and England between May 1970 and June 1971.
