A bungling council has fixed litter bins so high up lamp posts they are out of the reach of many people.

Some are up to six feet above the ground - leaving some frustrated people to leave their rubbish on the pavement instead.

Ipswich Borough Council said the bins cannot go at normal height because they would cover up inspection panels.

Too high: Harry Flack, four, needs his mother Nikki Evans, 42, to lift him up to put rubbish in the new bins

But they have now promised to lower them after a series of complaints.

Mark Keable, 54, said: 'When I saw the first one I thought it must have
been kids pushing them up, but I’ve since seen them all over the town.

'I’m 6ft 1in so it’s not a problem for me, but if you were vertically-challenged you just couldn’t do it.

'I’ve seen people leaving their rubbish on the ground beneath them.'

Rubbish: Nikki Evans, 42, who is 5ft tall, puts a bottle in one of the bins

A council spokesman said: 'Some of the bins are new and they’ve been placed above the inspection panels below them.

'There is no point in having bins people can’t reach, and it’s not every bin, but clearly one bin too high is one too many.

'They are too high for children and disabled people. We cannot blame people for leaving litter on the floor when they cannot reach the bin.

'We have been out to inspect the bins and we are working out a way to change the fitting on the back so they can be lowered.'

Can't reach: Olive Locksmith, 83, who is a wheelchair user, is unable to reach to put rubbish in the new bins in Ipswich

Rubbish: Bessie Joslin, 88, who is 5ft 7in tall and can only just reach the new bins which are around six feet up in the air
