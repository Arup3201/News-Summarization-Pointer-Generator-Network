Facing jail: Jordan Higgins, 31, has admitted holding up a newsagent near his home at dawn and stealing £2,000 of cigarettes

Alex 'Hurricane' Higgins' son faces jail today after he admitted holding up a newsagent at dawn and stealing £2,000 of cigarettes.

Jordan Higgins, 31, and a masked accomplice burst into a shop near his home in Cheadle near Manchester, in January.

They pushed shopkeeper Steven Gee off his stool and then emptied the cigarettes off the shelves into a duvet cover.

Both men were wearing headgear to hide their identities but no weapons were reported.  

At Minshull Street Crown Court, Higgins - who was given the middle name Alexander from his father - pleaded guilty to robbery.

Dressed smartly in a suit and speaking in a quiet voice, Higgins also confirmed his name and details before being told he will be sentenced later following the preparation of reports.

Higgins, of Cheadle  was given bail pending sentencing on November 13 but Judge Andrew Lowcock told him: 'The court is obviously going to be considering an immediate custodial sentence.'

After the case Higgins was later seen outside court smoking with friends.

Jordan was born a year after his father - who came to be known as 'The People's Champion' - became World Champion.

Alex Higgins famously sobbed as he hugged then wife Lynne and  daughter Lauren, then one.

His son Jordan's Facebook page is littered with videos featuring famous moments in his father's playing career.

Accompanying them are messages with one posted last March when the Hurricane would have been 65. It read: 'Happy birthday dad bit late was yesterday just woke up now after a mad weekend never forgotten xx.' 

Jordan was a pallbearer at his father's funeral alongside snooker stars Jimmy White and Ken Doherty. 

The Hurricane won the UK Championship in 1983 and the Masters in 1978 and 1981, making him one of nine players to have completed snooker's Triple Crown.

Tragedy: Alex Higgins, left and right is considered one of the snooker greats, but he struggled with drinking, gambling, and drug use until his death in 2010

But tragically Higgins snr's career subsequently crumbled under a litany of fines, bans and court-cases. 

He was left penniless after losing his luxury house in Cheshire to the taxman and was eventually stopped from seeing Jordan and Lauren following his divorced with Lynn.

Higgins was a heavy smoker, struggled with drinking and gambling, and admitted to using cocaine and marijuana. 

Diagnosed with throat cancer in 1998, Higgins died of the illness in his Belfast home on 24 July 2010.
