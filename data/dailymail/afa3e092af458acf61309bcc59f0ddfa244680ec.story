A video purporting to show the executions of two alleged spies has been released by Nigerian Islamist group Boko Haram.

One of the men is made to make a full confession, explaining his 'crimes' to the camera, before they pair are beheaded and their bodies shown to the camera.

Brutal: A gruesome video allegedly showing the executions of two men accused of working as police spies has been released by Nigerian Islamist group Boko Haram

The video, called 'Harvest of Spies', was posted Monday on Twitter by Boko Haram, the SITE intelligence group said today.   

It starts by showing a man kneeling in the foreground with a group of Boko Haram fighters approaching him holding a flag used by militant Islamist groups.

In a theatrical display previously seen in the execution videos released by ISIS, the men line up behind the victim.

The video then cuts to show two men, identified as Dawoud Muhammad and Muhammad Awlu, led by Boko Haram fighters before being made to kneel.

One Boko Haram fighter, whose face has been blurred by the militant group, stands behind Dawoud Muhammad, holding a large knife.

Horror: After one of the men has spoken of how they have spied on Boko Haram on behalf of the local police force, the pair are beheaded by militant fighters

Mr  Muhammad tells the camera that he  is a farmer from Baga, northern Nigeria, and is then made to answer a series of questions at knifepoint.

Mr Muhammad reveals that hat he had been approached by a police officer who offered him money in exchange for infiltrating Boko Haram.

'We went to see a man from Mijka and a police officer that was with him. The officer gave me 5,000 Naira (£16.20),' Mr Muhammad tells the camera.

Mr Muhammad is made to confess that their mission has been to spy on the 'residents who live here' i.e. Boko Haram, and in exchange for spying, the police officers had promised him that he would 'become rich and will never go back to be a farmer again'.

Promoting terror: The video emerged on a Boko Haram Twitter account on Monday

The camera pans from left to right in slow motion, showing Mr Muhammad and Mr Awlu on their knees as they are executed by Boko Haram fighters.

The video fades before the actual beheadings take place, and then shows the two men's bodies with their heads placed upon their chests. 

The video does not reveal how the spies were caught by the militants and MailOnline has yet to confirm its authenticity.

Boko Haram previously published only one beheading, of a Nigerian fighter pilot whose plane went missing in September.

Mr Muhammad's home town of Baga, was the site of a series of mass killings carried out by Boko Haram in January this year which is believed to have resulted in 2,000 deaths and saw more than 14,000 people flee the city.
