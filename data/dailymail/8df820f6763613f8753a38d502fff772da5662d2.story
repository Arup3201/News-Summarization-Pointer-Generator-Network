A British schoolboy has become the youngest person ever to trek to the South Pole.

Lewis Clarke, 16, broke the world record at 6pm yesterday following a gruelling 700-mile journey in temperatures as low as -50C.

He celebrated his incredible feat with a bowl of spaghetti bolognese - accompanied by a sprinkling of fresh parmesan.

Successful: Lewis Clarke, 16, from Bristol, has become the youngest person ever to trek to the South Pole

He ate the popular dish - his first proper meal in nearly seven weeks - in the warmth of a heated tent.

The GCSE student,
 from Bristol, spent 46 days in sub-zero temperatures and 120mph blizzards during his attempt to clinch the world record.

He travelled on skis for an average of eight hours and 18 miles a
 day, before reaching the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station a few hours later than expected. 

He is now expecting to have his record officially verified by Guinness World Records.

On his arrival, Lewis said: 'I'm really happy, but mostly relieved that for the first time in 48 days I don't have to get up tomorrow and drag my sled for nine hours in the snow and icy wind.

'Today was really hard. The closer I got to the Pole, the slower I went. My legs had had enough.

'But now I'm here and I've had some spaghetti bolognaise and I am sitting in a heated tent.'

Lewis, who was raising money for youth charity The Prince's Trust, began his epic journey on December 2.

He had been planning the expedition
 for three years and began a tough training regime a year ago, starting with a two-week polar training course in Norway.

Accompanied by experienced polar guide, Carl Alvey, he was forced to pull his own supplies during the trek - with the exception of three organised food drops.

He has also encountered a range of problems over the past 46 days, including blisters, a broken ski and coughs caused by the high altitudes,

Speaking
 during the Pole expedition, Lewis said: ‘I used to love snow, hate hot 
places and hot weather, and wear shorts in the middle of winter. Now I'm
 not too sure.

‘I've been through the entire list of Polar problems. I knew it would be hard, but it's harder than I ever thought it would be.

‘I think sometimes about how few people have done this. Only 300 in 100 years. That's pretty cool.’

By reaching the South Pole, Lewis has become the youngest person to ski the full 700 miles from the Antarctic coast to pole (Hercules Inlet route) - beating Sarah Landry, of Canada, aged 18, in 
2004.

The schoolboy has stayed overnight at the Pole and has been offered a tour of the Amundsen Scott Polar Research base today.

He is expecting to fly back to Union Glacier base camp later today and will be back in the UK on January 24.
