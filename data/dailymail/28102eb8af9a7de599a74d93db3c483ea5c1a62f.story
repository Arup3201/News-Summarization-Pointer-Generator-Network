A last-minute deal was reached in Northern Ireland today, after a budget dispute which threatened the return of direct rule from London.

David Cameron emerged from marathon talks in Belfast yesterday to say the fragile power-sharing agreement between the parties there had been stabilised.

The province had been on the brink of political collapse after wrangling over the welfare budget - which will be propped up with £2 billion in aid and loans from the UK Government over ten years.

The key parties in the Northern Irish administration, the Democratic Unionists and Sinn Fein, both welcomed the financial package and said they hoped to return to stability after months of uncertainty.

But the negotiations, which have been going on for around eleven weeks between five parties, did not reach an agreement on the vexed issues of flags and parades, a long-running sore for nationalists.

Not all parties are on board, and the deal, which involves a commitment to significant welfare and public sector reforms in Northern Ireland, is also likely to face challenges when implemented next year.

But the Prime Minister said last night that the Stormont House Agreement signalled Northern Ireland was ‘finally…able to deal with its past’.

‘I am delighted that a workable agreement has been reached that can allow Northern Ireland to enjoy a brighter, more prosperous future, while at the same time finally being able to deal with its past’, he said.

‘This agreement means the UK Government has been able to offer a significant financial package that opens the way for more prosperity, stability and economic security for Northern Ireland’.

The crisis threatened a return to Home Rule for the first time since 2007.

It was, in large part, triggered by the financial pressures of a ballooning public sector and their inability to implement welfare reforms passed by Westminster in February 2013.

The Belfast administration had faced paying a massive fine for over-spending on welfare - which was bitterly opposed by Sinn Fein and threatened to derail the government.

A package of financial assistance will help cover the shortfall while the parties work on a programme of welfare and public sector reform next year to deal with their chronic budget problems.

The deal also allows the Northern Ireland Government to boost its economy by reducing its rate of Corporation Tax from 21pc in the UK down to just 12.5pc, the rate in the Republic of Ireland.

And £150million of the UK government cash will go into investigations into killings which took place during the Troubles – there have only been around 200 prosecutions for some 3,500 deaths.

The First Minister, and DUP leader Peter Robinson said: ‘Of course every one of us would have liked to have had a more comprehensive and complete agreement but this is as much and more than we have ever been able to do on these issues in the past. So it is a very significant agreement.’

Sinn Fein Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the deal offered ‘a fresh start we need to seize with both hands’ and was a ‘remarkable achievement’ resolving issues of long-standing division.
