Elizabeth Shepherd was applauded as she was hailed an Apprenticeship Ambassador at the Labour conference, but has not heard from the party since

She was one of eight ‘ordinary’ voters whose story of struggle was said to have inspired Ed Miliband and his fight against the Tories.

Indeed, when she was twice asked to stand and receive a round of applause at the Labour Party conference last September Elizabeth Shepherd was feted as the face of new apprentices.

And the Labour leader was clearly so smitten with the 21-year-old from Bolton that within hours it was announced he wanted her to be an ‘Apprenticeship Ambassador.’

But it seems that Elizabeth has been rather forgotten by the Labour leader and his team.

Yesterday it emerged that Elizabeth has become fully qualified as an auto-electrician and been given a job by the First Group transport firm after finishing her apprenticeship studies at Manchester College.

But it was also revealed that she has heard absolutely nothing from Mr Miliband and his team about becoming their much vaunted  ‘Ambassador.’

Interviewed by broadcaster Nick Ferrari on his LBC breakfast programme yesterday she was asked about David Cameron’s plans for increased apprenticeships for the young. 

She praised the Cameron scheme but then she said: ‘You know I’ve still not heard back from Ed regarding being an apprenticeship ambassador so I’m not sure yet who I will vote for.’

Pressed by the radio host about her contact with Miliband and his Labour team, she was asked by Ferrari : ‘They (Labour) said they wanted to make you an apprenticeship ambassador. How much contact has there been since then?’

‘Not really any – I’ve not heard anything since that,’ replied Miss Shepherd.

Last September – fully four months ago - Mr Miliband extolled the virtues of his eight ‘ordinary voters - including Miss Shepherd – during his conference speech in Manchester.

‘I met somebody called Elizabeth the other day,’ he excitedly told the audience.

‘Where is she? She’s here. Elizabeth why don’t you stand up for one second…’

Since the conference Miss Shepherd has  qualified as an auto-electrician after finishing her apprenticeship studies at Manchester College - but said she may not vote for Miliband after he failed to contact her

Mr Miliband then called for a second round of applause for Miss Shepherd during his rambling speech and later she was told that he definitely wanted her to be a Labour ‘Apprenticeship Ambassador.’

The suggestion that the Labour leader wanted to ‘promote’ Miss Shepherd was widely reported at the time of the Conference.

But shortly after her appearance she perhaps showed some prescience about political promises when she was asked who she might vote for In May and replied:

‘You can’t really say until they are in power - when they go back on the words they say. I’m keeping an open mind to see what’s best for me personally.’

Last night a Labour party spokesman said: ‘We have spoken to Manchester College about Elizabeth since September and we will be contacting her directly.’
