Jeremy Clarkson's future at the BBC is to be decided next week when a report into a 'fracas' with a producer is handed to the director-general.

Clarkson was suspended after allegedly punching producer Oisin Tymon during a row after filming over a hot meal at a Yorkshire hotel.

The top-rating show was pulled off air while an inquiry was launched. 

BBC bosses have today said the report will be handed over to the director-general next week.

 The BBC could have kept Top Gear on air but James May and Richard Hammond refused to go on without their co-host Jeremy Clarkson, it has been revealed

The corporation reportedly put forward proposals for May and Hammond to continue to present live sections of the show, which would be combined with pre-recorded parts featuring Clarkson, but the two co-hosts refused. 

An executive from the corporation told The Sun that 'the whole thing had been a nightmare'. 

Clarkson and producer Mr Tymon have both now talked to an internal inquiry into the Top Gear fracas.  

Senior BBC executive Ken MacQuarrie has been tasked with sorting out what happened during the incident, but a date for the conclusion of the inquiry is not yet known. 

But James May scoffed at suggestions he and Richard Hammond were offered the opportunity to host the show without their under-fire colleague Jeremy Clarkson.

Reports suggested both had rejected the offer to host Top Gear without their suspended co-host.

However, speaking briefly from his west London home today, Mr May said he had not spoken to anybody at the BBC about it, so he hasn't had the opportunity to refuse to do it.

He said: 'It's not true. No-one has ever asked me if I was going to do it, there was never any suggestion that we were going to do it. So I've never had an opportunity to refuse to do it.

'I haven't spoke to anybody about it, it's completely new to me - I don't know where it's come from.'

Asked if he had spoke to Mr Hammond about hosting the show without Clarkson he said: 'No. But I definitely wasn't offered the opportunity, that's all I really want to say for now.'

May made light of the scenario again this morning on Twitter saying 'Once I've done the plumbing, I'm going to fire up Little Honda to see if Norman Tebbit's 'on yer bike' philosophy works. #StillUnemployed.'

Clarkson stayed silent today when asked how he felt about a BBC executive allegedly comparing him to Jimmy Savile.

Asked how he felt about the Savile comparisons as he pulled into his driveway, the suspended Top Gear presenter rolled his eyes.

The BBC has postponed the remaining episodes of Top Gear following the incident  - a move which has seen it lose millions of viewers and receive thousands of complaints.

Clarkson was suspended after allegedly punching producer Oisin Tymon during a row - which took place after filming - over a hot meal at a hotel. The top-rating show was pulled off air while an inquiry was launched 

Sunday night's planned episode was replaced by a Red Arrows documentary which pulled in just one million viewers - compared to the five million who regularly tune in for the popular motoring show.

Meanwhile, a petition to Bring Back Clarkson has attracted more than 960,000 supporters.

Another petition calling on the BBC to hire Alan Partridge, the fictional broadcaster played by Steve Coogan, as the new presenter of Top Gear has also been launched, with almost 20,000 signatures. 

A BBC spokesman refused to comment on any developments, saying: 'As we said last week we have an investigation ongoing and we won't comment further until that is concluded.'

Spokesmen for Tymon and Clarkson also declined to comment.  

On Tuesday, the BBC Trust ruled that Clarkson was not being racist when he used the word 'pikey' on Top Gear - a decision which has sparked condemnation from the Traveller Movement.

The presenter put up a placard with the words Pikey's Peak on the BBC2 series in February last year.

But the Trust's Editorial Standards Committee (ESC) concluded that the word had been used to mean 'cheap', rather than as a term of racist or ethnic abuse.

A spokesman for the Traveller Movement rejected the decision, saying: 'We are horrified by the BBC's green lighting of the use of the word 'pikey' by the Top Gear presenters.'

Clarkson raised more eyebrows this week when it emerged that in his column in Top Gear magazine, he discussed immigrant taxi drivers in London, saying that their cars smell 'faintly of lavender oil and sick'.

The presenter is still scheduled to appear alongside co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond at four live Top Gear shows in Norway on March 27 and 28 and a decision on whether to go ahead is expected soon.

Outspoken Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson has been involved in a string of controversies.

Most recently, the BBC Trust ruled that Clarkson was not being racist when he used the word 'pikey' on Top Gear - a decision which has sparked condemnation from the Traveller Movement.

The presenter put up a placard with the words Pikey's Peak on the BBC2 series in February last year.

He and the Top Gear team were chased out of Argentina after angry locals reacted with fury to Clarkson's number plate containing an apparent reference to the Falklands War.

The H982 FKL plate  was seen locally as a veiled reference to the 1982 conflict. However, the Top Gear denied their use of it was a deliberate reference to the war, and claimed it had simply been a coincidence.

In July, Ofcom ruled Clarkson deliberately used racist language by referring to an Asian man as a 'slope' during a Burma special.

The Indian High Commission in London formally complained to the BBC in 2012 about a special in which Clarkson travelled round India in a Jaguar with a toilet fixed to the boot.

Clarkson was also reported to have referred to the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown as a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot' in 2009.

And the year before, the BBC received more than 500 complaints after he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes.

Clarkson also made a mock Nazi salute while talking about a Mini design that might be 'quintessentially German' and received flak after describing those who jump in front of trains as 'Johnny Suicides'.

All three men's contracts expire three days after the Norway gigs, which could render any disciplinary hearings redundant.

Clarkson is also expected to record an episode of the BBC's top-rating satire show Have I Got News For You in May. 

Meanwhile, fellow Top Gear hosts May and Hammond took to Twitter to vent their frustration of being unemployed today.

May, 52, tweeted this morning: 'Three light bulbs in our house need replacing. I'm doing it today. #StillUnemployed.'

He later continued to make jokes that may have alluded to the fact that the show he hosts alongside Clarkson and Richard Hammond has been put on hold pending an inquiry into the 'fracas'.

He tweeted: 'Great news! We also need some new hoover bags. I can spin that out for an hour or two,' followed by a Haiku about his boredom.

The motorbike enthusiast, who earlier this week described his co host as a 'knob', wrote: 'Life, once so dazzling Sinks into a grey fog of Not-done-it-yourself'.

He continued to make light of the amount of free time on his hands, writing: 'Vegetables peel more easily if you wet them, yes. But why? #Unemployed.'

'Seriously, if you really are unemployed, good luck to you. It's not funny in reality.'

Then with a picture of the Ferrari badge he tweeted: 'Oh sod it. I'm going for a 'spin.''

He also made what could be interpreted as dark hints about the future of the show earlier in the week, saying: 'Last night, at precisely the moment Top Gear was due to start, the headlights on my car packed up. Not sure where I'm going with this.'

Richard Hammond also joined in with the dark hints today, tweeting a picture of a dog alongside a poem. 

He added: 'Not trying to be cryptic, just enjoying a gorgeous morning. Off..'

Jeremy Clarkson, 54, has not been active on Twitter for the past few days, but did change his profile last week to 'I am probably a presenter on the BBC2 motoring show, Top Gear.'
