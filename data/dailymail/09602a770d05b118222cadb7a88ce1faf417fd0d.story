Big spender: Jeffrey Burnham, 41, a former vice president and regional mortgage sales manager at TD Bank in Maine, allegedly used a corporate credit card to charge nearly $220,000 at strip clubs

A former executive at TD Bank in Maine is facing criminal charged for allegedly using a corporate credit card to spend nearly $220,000 at strip clubs.

Jeffrey Burnham, of Arundel, is scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court in Portland Thursday to face a federal charge of theft by a bank officer.

According to court documents, the 41-year-old Burnham used the card 72 times at strip clubs in Maine, Massachusetts, New York and Florida from February 2011 until February 2012, when he left the company.

Burnham was a vice president and regional mortgage sales manager in the bank's Falmouth office at the time.

Authorities say Mr Burnham claimed the spending was for business-related purposes.

If convicted of theft, Mr Burnham could face up to 30 years in prison and a $1million fine, Portland Press Herald reported. 

The Arundel man left TD in February 2012 after 14 years with the bank and went to work for Kennebunk Savings Bank, where he was promoted to senior vice president of retail banking last year. 

A press release announcing Burham’s career move described him as a graduate of the University of Maine at Farmington who served on the Arundel Recreation and Economic Development committees.

According to an affidavit written by FBI agent Paul Pritchard, the former banker used his TD-issued credit card to charge nearly $11,000 on December 2, 2011 at a company that operates Centerfolds strip club in Boston.

His other adult entertainment venue of choice was PT's Show club in Portland, stated the affidavit.He allegedly spent $35,000 at Centerfolds and Pt's club in less than a month.

Burnham's alleged financial malfeasance was uncovered in February 2012 – shortly after his departure from TD - when another bank employee opened his corporate credit card statement and noticed several suspicious charges.

When confronted about the expenses by TD investigators, the 41-year-old man admitted to misappropriating corporate funds.

In March 2013, Mr Burnham was questioned by FBI after his use of the corporate credit card, at which time he once again confessed to wrongdoing.

Burnham has not been arrested, and his attorney, Sarah Church, expects him to remain free after being formally charged later this week.
