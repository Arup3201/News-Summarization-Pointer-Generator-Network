Today police had cordoned off the area around the two-storey block as investigations took place.

Forensics officers in white overalls could be seen inside the burnt-out flat on the top floor.

Locals said they were shocked by the incident and had not seen anything suspicious in the run-up to the tragedy.

One shopkeeper said he had spoken to a downstairs neighbour who did not hear any disturbance prior to the blaze.
