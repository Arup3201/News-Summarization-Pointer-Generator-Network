All it takes is a flash of inspiration to come up with a great idea for a publicity stunt.

Officials in Shiqiaopu in southwest China dreamed up the idea of revamping the lavatories to highlight the region's place as a major wholesaler of digital cameras.

They have now commissioned 22 public conveniences to be redesigned to resemble the gadget with which the district is so proudly associated.

On of the councillors behind the scheme said: 'We really want 
people who come to the region to feel that they are living the digital 
world experience. We are very proud of our achievements.

'If
 anybody wants to buy an electronic gadget, they know that this is the 
best place to come.

'We have the best prices, the best products, and the 
best companies.

'The camera 
shaped toilets were simply a reflection of the region's success, 
designed to reinforce in people's minds that this is the 'one stop shop 
for all your digital needs'.

Promotion: The camera-shaped lavatories have become something of a talking point in Shiqiaopu which is famous for selling the gadget

Pride: A councillor said the design was a recognition of the region's pride as being associated with digital cameras

And the reception to the new public convenience has been positive.

In fact, the council is now already planning to highlight other locally made products by immortalising the toilets - including computers and mobile phones.

Shiqiaopu in southwest China has seen a massive influx of businesses selling all types of electronics recently - in particular digital cameras.Â
