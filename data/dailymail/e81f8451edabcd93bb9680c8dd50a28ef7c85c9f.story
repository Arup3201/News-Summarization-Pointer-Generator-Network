Gareth Bale is prepared to resist all offers of a return to the Barclays Premier League and stay at Real Madrid.

Bale has a £75million buyout clause in his six-year contract but that has not deterred Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea from checking on his availability.

The 25-year-old cost Madrid £86m when he joined from Tottenham and he rejected United in the process.

Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea are all hopeful of prising the Welshman away from Spain

However, the Wales winger has come in for heavy criticism for his recent Real performances and perceived selfishness during games.

Disgruntled fans have attacked his car while Spanish newspaper Marca refused to give him a rating for his display in the defeat by Barcelona.

United and Chelsea have sensed a deal could be done but the reply has been unequivocal; Bale is determined to stay, win over the fans and convince the world he can become one of Real Madrid’s greats.

Any transfer to the Premier League would cause Financial Fair Play problems but United have room for manoeuvre in that regard, as do Chelsea. City would have to sell if they were to pursue a deal.
