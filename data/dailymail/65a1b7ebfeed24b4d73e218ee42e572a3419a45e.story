According to new research, meerkats enhance their intelligence through nine different social and asocial mechanisms.

The meerkat is an extremely social animal, living in tightknit 
colonies of between 20 and 30 individuals who make their homes in vast 
networks of tunnels.

What really makes these animals stand
out is their intelligent coordinated behaviour, which rivals that of chimps, 
baboons, dolphins and even humans in its complexity and efficiency.

One of the terms given to a group of meerkats is a 'mob'

A team led by William Hoppitt 
of the University of St. AndrewsÂ  presented wild meerkats with a novel 
foraging task to investigate the animal's learning mechanisms.

They then applied a unique model to study how the meerkats went about the task.

'The model deals with the rate at which individuals interact with the task, solve the task once they are interacting with it, or give up on the task when they are manipulating it,' said Hoppitt.

'It allows us to ask whether these things are affected by previous experience manipulating the task and observing others.'

They found that the meerkats engaged in a
wide variety of social and asocial behaviours to learn to solve the 
task, and that in general the social factors helped draw the meerkats 
into the task, while the asocial processes helped them actually solve 
the task.

'Meerkats that have solved the task in the past are more likely to interact with it, give up on it less quickly, and be quicker to solve the task once they have started interacting with it,' said Hoppitt.

'They also become faster at solving the task as they have unsuccessful attempts, suggesting they learn from their mistakes.

'However, at the same time it appears that very successful meerkats give up on the task sooner, and very unsuccessful meerkats persist for longer, suggesting simply that meerkats try harder when they are hungrier,' he continued.

'We find that meerkats that see others solving the task interact with the task more, and persist for longer in trying to solve it: they seem to learn by observation that it is possible to get into the box to get the food.'

Based on these results, the team propose a new model for characterising social learning mechanisms in the field.

The model may also be more broadly applicable and can be used to investigate the relationship between social learning mechanisms and so-called 'behavioural traditions' that together can constitute a culture.

'At the moment we plan to apply the methods to groups of monkeys and birds, but might try an experiment on human participants at some stage in the future,' said Hoppitt.

The full report is published in the open access journal PLOS ONE.

The small desert mammals are found in Namibia, Botswana, Angola and South Africa
