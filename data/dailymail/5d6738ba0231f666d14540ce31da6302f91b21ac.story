Recovering female alcoholics are more likely to relapse because Alcoholics Anonymous does little to understand the reasons behind their drinking, according to a new study.

John Kelly, a psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital, and his colleague Bettina Hoeppner found that male and female alcoholics drink for different reasons.

Men are more likely to relapse when they are in 
social-drinking situations, whereas women tend to drink when they are feeling down.

Women trend to drink when they are feeling down yet Alcoholics Anonymous does little to these handle these emotion-driven cravings, found the study

The study analysed data that was collected over the course 
of 15 months from 1,726 Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) members.

The study looked at their social networks, 
drinking habits and how confident they were in their ability to stay 
sober in a variety of situations.

AA largely helps men stay sober by encouraging them to spend their recovery time with friends that don't drink and by helping them
cope when they happen to find themselves with friends who are drinking.

The study found that female alcoholics are more likely to drink when feeling down, but AA doesn't do much to help them handle these emotion-driven cravings.

Speaking about the results, Kelly said: 'The findings really 
underscore gender-based differences in relapse risk.

'If AA 
addressed these needs in its programs, it could become even 
more effective.'

AA  was founded by Bill Wilson and Dr Bob Smith in June 1935 in Akron Ohio.

It has become a worldwide movement spread out with over 100,000 groups with  2 million members in 150 countries.

The WHO estimates that over 140 million people globally are affected by alcoholism with around one third of AA members being women.
