British actor and film director Richard Attenborough, who died at the age of 90 on Saturday, won the imagination of millions over his 60-year career on the screen. 

In the early years he was best known for his roles in Brighton Rock and The Great Escape, and later for his behind-the-scenes part as director and producer of Gandhi, which won him critical acclaim for his 'typically sympathetic and sure-handed' direction of the movie.

Meanwhile his role as the 'best Santa ever', according to his co-star Dylan McDermott in the remake of Miracle on 34th Street in 1994, moved a generation of children born in the Eighties.

And in his part as the eccentric millionaire in Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park in 1993 and later in the 1997 sequel, Lord Attenborough continued to win the hearts and minds of cinema-goers.

1. Jurassic Park

Attenborough became a cult figure for youngsters in the 1994 film and 1997 sequel with his role as John Hammond, a sympathetic grandfather who builds a dream-come-true dinosaur park.

2. Gandhi

Produced and directed by Attenborough, the 1982 film looks back on the leader of India's independence movement against the UK's rule of the country during the 20th century. The biographical movie bagged eight Academy awards - a record for British film - including best director.

3. Brighton Rock

Attenborough first appeared on the screen in this 1947 film as psychopathic gangster Pinkie Brown. It was a role that cast him as a hoodlum for the next few years until he moved on to play more sympathetic characters.

4. Miracle On 34th Street

Attenborough's brilliant performance convinces the children of New York that he is Santa Claus. But when he ends up in court, his trademark twinkle and white beard doesn't cut the mustard and he relies on help from six-year-old Susan to prove he's the real deal in this 1994 remake.

5. The Great Escape

During the Sixties, Attenborough showed a fondness for military roles, playing the POW mastermind Bartlett in The Great Escape in 1963. He later went on to play the ship's engineer Frenchy Burgoyne in The Sand Pebbles in 1966 and Sergeant Major Lauderdale in Guns at Batasi in 1964.
