Lewis Holtby will look for a move away from Tottenham before the transfer window closes after the north London club made it clear he is surplus to requirements.

The German midfielder came on as a substitute for Spurs in their 1-0 win at West Ham on Saturday but new boss Mauricio Pochettino doesn't feel he needs Holtby as a member of his squad and Tottenham are open to offers for the 23-year-old.

Managerless Crystal Palace and QPR are among those linked with the midfielder and the revelation that Spurs no longer want to hold onto the man they signed from Schalke in January 2013 could ignite their interest.

Holtby spoke highly of Pochettino's coaching work earlier this week but it seems the new manager will move him on from White Hart Lane.

The Germany international didn't manage to secure a place in his country's World Cup winning squad after a six-month loan spell at Fulham but he has been given minutes by Spurs during pre season.

It appeared that Holtby could be given a new lease of life under the new manager but he now must find a new club before September 1's transfer deadline.
