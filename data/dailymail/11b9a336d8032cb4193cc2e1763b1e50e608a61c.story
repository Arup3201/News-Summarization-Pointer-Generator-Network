A family have been forced to live with a pair of doves who flew in through a window nested on their living room floor because they are a protected species and cannot be removed.

David and Angela Blackburn said the birds set themselves up a home inside their four-bedroom property in Nelson, Blackburn, after flying in without them realising.

The birds arrived with two eggs which have since hatched and they have now laid a second lot of eggs.

We are family: David Blackburn, 57, is unable to remove the doves from his property because they are protected by law - even though they have covered it in their waste

By law the family are unable to touch the nest - even though the doves have covered their property in their waste and feathers.

Mr Blackburn, 57, shares the home with Angela, 40 and step-daughter Emma, 18 and his son James, aged eight.

He said: 'I’d been airing the spare room with the window wide open.

'Late in the afternoon I heard something and when I went in I was stunned to see the bird sat on top of two eggs which she had laid in an open metal tin.

'She looked at me as if to say "who the hell are you?". After that both her and the male bird took turns to incubate the eggs.'

David took advice from the RSPB who said as there was no health and safety issue and the eggs were in a communal living area they could not be removed.

A spokesman for RSPB, said: 'A nest is such as this is legally protected. It can’t be tampered with, damaged or removed and access can’t be blocked to it.

'There are certain exemptions such as interference with crops and Health and Safety issues.

'If this family believed there was such an issue they could seek recourse through Natural England to see if the nest could be removed.'

David said: 'They’ve now become part of the family and are very tame. One of them even runs up my arm and sits on my shoulder.

Nesting: The doves have laid two eggs and two chicks hatched. Since then, another two eggs have been laid

'I think looking after them has been good and also educational for my son James, he feeds them wild bird seed and checks that they are okay.

'It’s funny but the doves arrived on our fifth wedding anniversary and one of the highlights of our big day was releasing a pair of white doves.

'It looks like they’re here to stay in the short term, we’re taking advice on cleaning procedures and we’ve been told that they should take a break from breeding soon.'

Such is the family’s attachment to their feathered room-mates that James’ cub-scout group are being asked to give names to the expanding brood.

A spokesman for the RSPB added: 'It’s an unusual case but feral doves and pigeons only need a few loose twigs on which to lay eggs.

'They’re not like other breeds which take weeks to build intricate and more sturdy nests.'
