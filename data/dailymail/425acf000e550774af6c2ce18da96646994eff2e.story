A father has spoken of his heartbreak after the last photos of his wife, who died from cancer the day after their wedding, were stolen by heartless thieves.

Laura Pemberton, 29, died just 24 hours after walking down the aisle with her partner of nine years and father of her three children, 32-year-old Gareth Sumner.

Ms Pemberton, from Merseyside, had been diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of cancer just six weeks earlier.

Heartbreaking tale: Gareth Sumner, with his and Laura Pemberton's children (from left) Isis, eight, Elliot, three, and Chloe, six. Right, Ms Pemberton with her son at her sister's wedding, shortly before her death

Two burglars broke into Mr Sumner’s home on Friday morning and stole computers containing pictures of the June 2010 nuptial, and a recording of Ms Pemberton singing to their three-year-old son Elliot.

Mr Sumner awoke to hear sounds in his home, just north of Liverpool, and went downstairs to see two men in dark clothing running off with two laptops and four computer games consoles.

The laptops contained precious pictures of Ms Pemberton and a Nintendo DSi which had a sound clip of her singing to then-baby son Elliot.

Mr Sumner said: 'Elliot was only just one when his mum died so he never knew her properly.

'We’d kept this recording of her singing to him for when he was older so he could hear what she sounded like.

'It was his connection to his mum.'

Final memories: The loving couple of nine years with their two daughters before the family were torn apart so early in the children's lives

The brave widower chased the two thieves down the street barefoot but lost them as they went into the woods.

Son Elliot was in the house at the time of the burglary but daughters Isis, eight, and six-year-old Chloe were at a friend’s house.

A witness told police that after the burglary they had seen a dark coloured large saloon, thought to have been a private hire taxi, stop at a junction where a passenger got out and collected a bag from behind a wall before getting back in.

Bereaved Mr Sumner had been engaged to Ms Permberton for four years before they got married.

Doctors urged the couple to fast-forward their plans because of her rapidly deteriorating health.

The wedding day was arranged in just two weeks after her family made an appeal on local radio for help.

Local dress shops, jewellers, florists, cakemakers and photographers offered their services for Ms Pemberton’s special day.

Sorely missed: Mr Sumner dreads the thought that he will never again see the couple's precious photos of their wedding day, which was brought forward when doctors said Ms Pemberton had only six weeks to live

DC Andy Bason, from Merseyside Police Burglary team, said: 'I would like to hear from anyone who has any information about this burglary or who is offered any of this property for sale.

'I am particularly keen to talk to the taxi driver who was in the area at the time, or the passengers, and would urge them to come forward.

'This family has recently lost their wife and mother and the images contained on the computers cannot be replaced.

'This has completely devastated them and I would appeal directly to those responsible or people who know them to do the right thing.

'One of the games consoles taken, a white Nintendo DS owned by one of the children, also has recordings of her mother, which she listens to all the time.

'I would urge anyone who has any information that can help us to reunite her with this to contact the police.'
