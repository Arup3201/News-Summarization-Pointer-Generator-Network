Islamist gunmen stormed a university in Iraq and killed three police officers before briefly taking dozens of students hostage in a dormitory.

The armed men, dressed in black, stormed 
into rooms at Anbar University, west of Baghdad, and told students to stay put before they let them go 
following a stand off.

The attack came as Islamic extremists and other anti-government militias have held parts of the nearby provincial capital of Ramadi and the city of Fallujah since December amid rising tensions between Sunni Muslims and the Shiite-led government.

Attack: The gunmen stormed Anbar University, west of Baghdad, this morning, taking dozens of students hostage in a dormitory

An Al Qaeda splinter group known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and other Sunni-led militants have controlled parts of Anbar province, including the city of Fallujah and parts of Ramadi, since late December.

Iraq is currently grappling with its worst surge in violence since the sectarian bloodshed in 2006 and 2007, when the country was pushed to the brink of civil war despite the presence of tens of thousands of US troops.

The latest violence has been fueled by Sunni Muslim anger at the Shiite-led government in Baghdad, as well as the civil war in neighboring Syria.

ISIL has carried out scores of deadly attacks on both sides of the border and imposed a brutal form of Islamic rule in territories under its control. It was not immediately clear if ISIL was behind the university attack.

Violence has claimed the lives of 799 
Iraqis in May, the highest monthly death toll so far this year.

The soaring casualty rate has underlined the daunting challenges the 
government faces as it struggles to contain a surge in sectarian 
violence.
