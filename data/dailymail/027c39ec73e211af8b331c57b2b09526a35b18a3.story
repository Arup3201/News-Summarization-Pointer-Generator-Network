Former England international Delon Armitage allegedly threatened to ‘take the face off’ a Leicester supporter as tempers boiled over at Welford Road on Sunday.

The Toulon full-back was involved in an angry exchange after his side’s 25-21 defeat in the European Champions Cup.

He has also been accused of calling supporters ‘inbred c****’ as he walked towards the dressing rooms at half-time and European Professional Club Rugby last night launched an investigation into that incident.

Ex-Leicester favourite Martin Castrogiovanni added to the drama in the East Midlands with an expletive-ridden attack on former boss Richard Cockerill. Castrogiovanni apologised on Monday night but EPCR are probing his behaviour, too.

An eyewitness to the post-match Armitage spat said: ‘Delon got some banter after he walked into the fan bar instead of the players’ lounge by mistake. As he turned away, someone shouted something, which I didn’t hear, and then he reacted.

‘He said, “If that’s the f****** attitude you’re going to take, then let’s take it where nobody can see what happens. Let’s go and do this in the car park, face to face, where I’m going to take yours off”.

‘Thank God there weren’t any fisticuffs because that would have taken things to a different level.’

The 30-year-old had stormed down the tunnel at full-time, refusing to shake hands with the Leicester players. According to Sportsmail sources, he told Tigers players: ‘We don’t do tunnels in France’, although he is fully aware it is customary in English rugby.

It is not the first time Armitage has been involved in controversy. Last year, he was involved in a spat with former England hooker Brian Moore.

He called Moore a ‘fat p****’ and told him to ‘Go write another s*** book’ after criticism of his goading try celebration in the 2013 Heineken Cup final. In 2012, the former London Irish player was arrested for an alleged assault in a Torquay nightclub. During his time at the Aviva Premiership club, he was also handed an eight-week ban for pushing and verbally abusing a doping official.

Sunday’s alleged altercation adds spice to the return leg. If Armitage is not suspended, he should feature in this weekend’s Pool 3 tie, but he can expect a fiery reception from travelling Leicester fans.

‘Players normally stop for photographs and autographs around the area where it happened, so there were a lot of children around,’ added Sportsmail’s source, who has been a Tigers season ticket-holder for more than 20 years. ‘I was shocked. I’ve seen banter flying around, but never experienced that.’

Armitage has been capped 26 times by England but has not represented his country for more than three years. He is the older brother of Steffon Armitage, whose performances for Toulon have led to calls for him to be drafted into Stuart Lancaster’s squad for the World Cup.

Neither player nor club was available for comment when contacted by Sportsmail on Monday.
