A remarkably preserved Iron Age road dating back to 75BC has been discovered in East Anglia.

Archaeologists found a 13ft-wide timber structure complete with stabilising posts running for 1,600ft (500m) across wetland near the River Waveney at Geldeston.

The wood is in such good condition that it almost looks modern, according to experts, who believe that the structure could be the work of the Iceni tribe.

Wood you believe it? The 2,000-year-old structure was very well preserved

It's thought that the road would have helped traders move across the wetlands of Norfolk

Wood often disintegrates over time, but this structure was found buried in peat, which helped to preserve it.

Kristina Krawiec, a University of Birmingham archaeologist who was on the dig team, told the BBC: ‘Instead of getting post holes, we're getting the posts that would have gone in them. We're understanding more about the technology and skills that went into these sort of things.’

The archaeologists at the excavation, which took place in June, even found tool marks in the wood, which is incredibly rare.

The road was dated using 
dendrochronology – otherwise known as tree-ring dating - where ring 
patterns on wood are analysed to determine its age.

A more thorough test will be carried out, but if it does originate from 75BC, then the structure pre-dates the Roman invasion by 100 years.

The Iceni ruled over most of the area now known as Norfolk between 100BC to around 100 AD, when, despite their best efforts, they were defeated by the invading legions.

Their road would not only have facilitated movement around the area’s soggy land, but would have been used to mark territory and demonstrate their power, as it would have looked very impressive to anyone passing through the area.

John Davies, chief curator at Norwich Castle Museum, explained to the BBC that some of the tools he has on display may have been used to make the road.

He said: ‘This particular track way is very interesting to us because we have tools... which may actually tie in with some of the tool marks and methods of construction we are turning up in the excavation.’
