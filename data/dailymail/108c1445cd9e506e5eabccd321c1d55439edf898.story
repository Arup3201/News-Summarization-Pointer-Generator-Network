Fifty teenagers spent their prom night at a fire station after alcohol was found aboard their buses, police have said.

The students from Orange, Texas were caught red-handed on the chartered buses after Kemah police were called to help a teenager needing medical attention because of his diabetes.

Police, who said the boy's situation was not related to alcohol, boarded one of the buses after it arrived in Kemah and allegedly found numerous bottles of alcohol on board.

A second bus was later stopped and alcohol was also found aboard that vehicle, police said. Both bus groups were heading to Kemah to celebrate their prom.

The bus drivers, Rachad Tadahk, 51, and Jacob Shears, 24, were the only adults on the buses and were charged with furnishing alcohol to minors.

The men claimed that they did not know the teens were consuming alcohol, but the police chief argued that 'you could smell the alcohol pouring out of the bus', the Houston Chronicle reported.

Tadahk had been driving around 40 teenagers from Little Cypress-Mauriceville High School, while Shears was driving a smaller bus of 15 teenagers from Lake Jackson, Texas.

The teenagers were taken to Kemah Fire Station so they could call their parents and be collected.

Once there, one student took a photograph of a group of girls in long, sparkly prom dresses smiling as they sat at tables and it was posted to Instagram.

'Some had not been drinking but a large portion had. We could have given out 50 tickets that night,' Kemah Police Chief Greg Rickard said.

'There was no partying in the fire station, everyone wanted to get on with their evening.'

Only one student was arrested. Ashley Meadows, 17, was put in a cell after she was belligerent.

'My understanding, she became belligerent and was combative and 
argumentative and was cursing and she had a bottle of booze in her purse
 and she went to jail for that,' Rickard told Click2Houston.

She was charged with disorderly conduct and with a minor in possession.

Rikard added: 'It's very unusual. We have a lot of people that come to our town. But we normally don't have these types of issues.'
