Meaghan White is accused of raping the 16-year-old boy who she taught

A teacher has been accused of raping a 16-year-old boy who she taught at a center for troubled teens.

Meaghan White, 34, of Valley Cottage, New York, was working at Leake & Watts residential centre in Yonkers for three months. 

She has been accused of raping the student in Mount Vernon and at Glenwood Lake, in New Rochelle, New York.

Lucian Chalfen, a spokesman for the Westchester County District Attorney's Office, confirmed both cases involve the same student. 

He said: 'All allegations remain under investigation.' 

White was arrested on Wednesday by police and she was released without bail by a Mount Vernon city judge after the District Attorney's Office asked for $15,000 bail.

She was charged on Thursday for third-degree rape and third-degree criminal sexual act.

White has not entered a plea to the judges but will return to court on January 14.

The teacher has been suspended without pay from the job.

Meredith Barber, a spokeswoman for Leake & Watts, told The Journal News: 'We are deeply disturbed by these allegations.'
