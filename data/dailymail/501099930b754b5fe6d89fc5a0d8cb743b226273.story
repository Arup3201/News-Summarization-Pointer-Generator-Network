This boy couldn't resist when he saw his opportunity for his 15 minutes of fame. 

While a news crew in Las Vegas covers the grand opening of Downtown Summerlin, a 125 store shopping and marketplace complex, the boy can be seen looking displeased the camera isn't focusing on him.

But when one of the presenters steps aside, so the revelry behind her can be seen, he saunters into shot and steals the show.

Boogie nights: Two girls watch on amused as the boy starts breaking into his routine like a seasoned dancer

As if staring in his own audition, he looks straight down the barrel of the camera, turns on his heal and strikes a pose. 

Then he breaks-into his dance routine.

He bobs his head up and down and moves his hands from his thighs into a chest-high claps, before breaking out his big-moves... the lasso. 

Ensuring he has the full attention of viewers at home, he then points to the camera, before moving through a sequence of other cringe-worthy tricks.

Owned it: The boy finishes his routine by striking a pose and looking down the lens with plenty of attitude

And like any star on a stage, he completed his performance by striking a pose.

Video of the impromptu performance has already spread across social media and has attracted several hundred thousand views on YouTube. 

Downtown Summerlin was expected to create 2,000 new jobs and the local community were told to turn up with their job references. It is not known if there were any vacancies for dancers.
