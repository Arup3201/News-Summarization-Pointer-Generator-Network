Brown stains on your favourite t-shirt, streaky marks on your stomach where your waistband has been rubbing? 

It is the 21st Century woman (and man)'s pre-holiday dilemma - what to wear after a spray tan? 

Salon owner Leanne LeGuen, 31, from Lancashire has now come up with a solution - the Bronzie. 

The specially-constructed onesie is made from a lightweight material that is designed to prevent sweating and loose fittings around wrists, ankles and waistband are supposed to prevents any tan lines.

The garment has already attracted A-List fans from the most perma-tanned section of the showbiz world - Strictly Come Dancing.

All of the contestants and dancers from the show have to be booked in for weekly sprays, to make sure their skin has a healthy glow next to their sequinned dance costumes. 

Frankie Bridge from The Saturdays, Janette Manrara, Ola Jordan, Sunetra Sarker , Alison Hammond and Jake Wood have all tweeted their love for the Bronzie.  

The creator Leanne decided to design the product after several years of queries from clients on what to wear to her salon when booked in for a tan.

She said: 'Eighteen months ago, I had a vision to create a product that was both practical yet stylish.

'Since the initial concept idea, I have worked tirelessly exploring various product development options including design, material and manufacturing.   

'The Bronzie uses a special fabric that glides over freshly spray-tanned skin leading to reduced tan lines. 

'The fabric is also breathable which prevents staining of bedding and clothing, there is nothing else like it available.' 

Strictly dancers Janette Manrara (left) and Joanne K. Clifton (centre) and actress Jenny Gibney (right) have also been making good use of their Bronzies 

'It can be worn immediately after self-tan applications yet without hampering the self-tanning process.'

'I believe Bronzie will become the must-have fashion accessory of 2014 and thereon in the tanning industry. 

The Bronzie costs £49.99, plus postage and packing and comes in two sizes: small-medium and medium-large.
