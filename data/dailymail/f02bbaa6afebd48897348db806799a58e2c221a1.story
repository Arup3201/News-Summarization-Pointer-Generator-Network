A 39-year-old Fresno woman's dream to have a baby came true on Thursday, only she wasn't awake to celebrate the joyous moment.

Melissa Carleton is in her tenth week in a coma and gave birth via c-section to a healthy baby boy as her family waited anxiously to hold the little one.

Doctors say the family therapist was left 'unable to fully wake up' following a seizure brought on by a benign tumor, but hope she'll soon join her husband in cuddling with their newborn son.

'I know that being able to love this little guy is going to be a wonderful experience, but I also know it's going to be very hard for me to know that I am going to be the one to hold this baby first,' Carleton's husband Brian Lande told KFSN-TV.

Lande described the heartbreaking reasons that his son's birth was like both a dream and a nightmare for his comatose life.

'She was also terrified that she would miss the baby and something would happen to her and she wouldn't get to meet our son and she wouldn't get to participate in being a mother,' Lande said.

Carleton's father John Farrell had an easier time looking to the bright side of things as he welcomed his grandson to the world.

'She’s wanted to have a child for years,' he told ABC News. 'Today, I can’t begin to tell you how happy we are. It’s indescribable.'

Just before the surgery that brought the bundle of joy to the world, Farrell told ABC of a achingly beautiful moment when his daughter--who can open her eyes and squeeze her loved ones' hands--showed more signs of life than she had at any time throughout her two and a half months on unconsciousness.

'In a few tender moments, she reached out to Brian, took his cheek, pulled his cheek down to her face and held it there,' Farrell said. 'It was the first time she had hugged Brian since this trauma happened.'

Carleton first learned of her tumor during a visit to the emergency room over terrible headaches.

The expectant mom originally planned to wait until after she gave birth for surgery to remove the tumor, but her health quickly deterioted to the point where she was unable to walk short distances with needing to sit down and rest.

'She was also terrified that she would miss the baby and something would happen to her and she wouldn't get to meet our son and she wouldn't get to participate in being a mother,' Lande said.

New addition: The little boy is doing great and his mother will be transferred to a rehab facility once she recovers from the surgery

Waiting game: 'I know that being able to love this little guy is going to be a wonderful experience, but I also know it's going to be very hard for me to know that I am going to be the one to hold this baby first,' said Lande

The expectant mom originally planned to wait until after she gave birth for surgery to remove the tumor, but her health quickly deterioted to the point where she was unable to walk short distances with needing to sit down and rest.

In March, she suffered a seizure and was rushed in for emergency surgery. She has not woken up since, though KFSN reports that the surgery went fine and that the seizure is to blame for the coma.

Doctors plan to transfer Carleton to a rehab facility once she recovers from her c-section, where they hope she'll wake up from her coma.

Meanwhile, Lande has created a GoFundMe page to help raise money to cover his wife's mounting medical expenses.

As of Thursday evening, it had raised close to $80,000 of a $100,000 goal.
