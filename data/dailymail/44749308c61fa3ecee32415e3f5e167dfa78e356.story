Jacqui Lambie has taken another swipe at Tony Abbott, declaring the prime minister needs 'a bucket of cement' to toughen up if he can't cop her criticism and telling him that she will be prime minister one day.

The Palmer United Party senator's comments come after she said yesterday that Tony Abbott was a 'political psychopath' who put the lives of his daughters at risk by 'parading' them around on the campaign trail last year.

Her comments caused a stir, but the rookie senator has remained unfazed and has offered Mr Abbott some free advice about how to handle critics.

Jacqui Lambie has continued her attack on Tony Abbott, after she said yesterday that he had endangered the lives of his daughters last year during the election campaign

'If you're not used to attacks by now then you probably shouldn't be in that position,' she told the Nine Network.

'You've got one of two choices. You can run and hide or you can say to yourself "here's a bucket of cement - toughen up".'

She also rejected suggestions she'd crossed the line by dragging families into the political fray, rehashing her belief that Mr Abbott put his daughters at risk during the election campaign.

The former military police officer said there was a fine line between enlisting your family's support and 'parading' them for political gain.

'That really bothers me that you've got those pretty young girls running around in front of a camera, and I just thought, "is your political career more important than your own daughters' security?"' she told ABC radio on Thursday.

'I think, being ex-military, that was the last straw for me.'

'Let's face it, they are really three gorgeous looking girls,' she said of Mr Abbott's daughters.

'I can only hope that they can stay safe but I guess we'll see what happens in the future.'

The outspoken former military officer made headlines last month when she called the prime minister a 'bare-faced, uncaring liar'.

Senior government minister Christopher Pyne said he hoped Senator Lambie reflected on the respect and mutual support that's expected of politicians when she entered the Senate on Monday.

'I think Jacqui Lambie and all of us in Canberra should treat each other with the respect that all colleagues deserve,' he told the Nine Network.

But Senator Lambie claimed she hadn't been offered the same courtesy and would keep up the biff.

Senator Lambie's comments come as the Abbott government continued to negotiate with the three new PUP senators as it attempts to get its tough new budget measures passed.

But Senator Lambie also flagged she would be independently minded, saying her party's leader and founder Clive Palmer did not 'control' her.

'We've all got a head on our shoulders.'

'You know what, start extending the olive branch or I guess we're going to be playing this game with each other for some time yet,' she warned.
