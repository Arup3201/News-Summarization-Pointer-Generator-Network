Threat: Despite the Palace and Prince Harry's lawyers saying that papers would breach PCC rules if they printed the naked photos, they are yet to complain about The Sun's front page

There was a deafening silence from the Palace today despite the infamous naked photos of Prince Harry partying in Las Vegas being published in the British press for the first time.

So far more than 850 people have 
officially complained about The Sun putting his nude body on its front 
page this morning.

But the Press Complaints Commission 
has told MailOnline this afternoon that none of those protests came from the beleaguered prince, his lawyers, or the royal household.

The third in line to the throne was 
pictured in just a necklace with a naked girl hiding behind him having played a game of 
strip billiards in his VIP Las Vegas suite. Another showed him giving the same topless woman a naked bear hug.

Until The Sun published them today, British
newspapers and websites were unique in the world at being unable to show naked photographs of Prince Harry, despite tens of millions 
seeing them online across the globe.

This was at the insistence of St James’s Palace, who said despite these circumstances they were a gross invasion of the 
prince’s privacy and must not be used.

Harry's lawyers, Harbottle & 
Lewis, also sent warning letters to national newspapers via the Press 
Complaints Commission stating that if they were printed they would then breach PCC guidelines.

But despite that threat, the Palace has not complained and today repeated their statement of last night: 'We have made 
our views on Prince Harry's privacy known.

Newspapers regulate 
themselves, so the publication of the photographs is ultimately a 
decision for editors to make,' a spokesman said.

A PCC spokesman confirmed to MailOnline that a full investigation could be launched after a third party complaint, but this was unlikely to happen in a privacy case like this one unless Harry made a protest.

Quiet: Despite warnings about printing the pictures, so far St James Palace, pictured, nor Harry's lawyers have complained to Britain's press watchdog

Rupert Murdoch's paper The Sun argued
the decision to print the images was is in the public interest and a 'crucial' 
test of Britain's free press, especially as an estimated 40 million 
across the globe have already seen them online.

Their front page carried the headline: 'Heir it is!' adding in its editorial: 'We believe Harry has compromised his own privacy, adding it was 'vital' that the paper ran them as 'the Prince Harry pictures are a crucial test of Britain's free Press.'

Sun managing editor David Dinsmore 
said the paper had 'thought long and hard' about whether to use the 
pictures.

Anger: Former Labour deputy leader Lord Prescott said the decision was not about privacy, it was about 'money, money, money'

He said: 'We are not against him letting his hair down once in a while. For us this is about the freedom of the press.

'This
is about our readers getting involved in discussion with the man who's 
third in line to the throne, it's as simple as that.'

The newspaper's decision to publish the images provoked mixed reaction among those both and in and outside the media industry.

Former
deputy prime minister Lord Prescott said The Sun had shown 'absolute 
utter contempt' for the law and for the Lord Justice Leveson inquiry 
into media ethics.

'It 
is not about privacy. It is about money, money, money. And they know 
that by exclusively printing the pictures, assuming they are the only 
(British) paper which does, they will get everybody buying the paper to 
see this.'

Meanwhile, Former Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie welcomed the move.

'If
Prince Harry with no clothes on in a Las Vegas hotel room surrounded by
one naked woman and a load of other people he has just met in 
drinking-stripping game is not a story then it is hard to know what is,'
he told BBC2's Newsnight.

'He
must realise that with his rather important role as a prince of our 
country and is number three (in line) to the throne that he has to carry
various responsibilities.

'People
should stop worrying about privacy and start worrying about what free 
speech will mean to this country if the Levesons and the Camerons of 
this country have their way.'

Until
now, the public has been able to read about the prince's antics but to 
see the images has had to access the US-based celebrity gossip website 
TMZ that broke the story, or scores of other internet pages across the 
globe.

The Press Complaints Commission said it would investigate the matter 'following normal procedures' if it received any complaints.

PCC has received more than 850 complaints, but none from the Palace or Harry's lawyers

This is despite both stating that printing the pictures would be a gross invasion of privacy
