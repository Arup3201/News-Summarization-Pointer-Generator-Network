Four adorable African lion cubs left their den for on Thursday and took their first outdoor steps in their enclosure at San Diego Zoo Safari Park.

The young lions consist of one male and three females, and the zoo keeper who cares for them in the park says that since their birth on June 22 they have changed considerably.

During the footage the cubs stay very close to their protective mother, Oshana, but they also display  independence by being playful and vocal.

The cubs weighed about three-and-a-half pounds at birth but they have now grown significantly and weigh 22 pounds each.

The San Diego Zoo safari park worker says the cubs are currently  12 weeks and  are 'very active, very healthy cubs and have very strong personalities'.

The keeper also describes the transition the young cubs have made from being small shy cubs initially to embracing life at the zoo.

He says: 'The cubs were very hesitant but they trusted their mom and while very cautious they went right out up to the glass and visited the people that were here.'

The four cubs have been named Ernest, Evelyn, Marion and MIss Ellen after benefactors Ernest and Evelyn Rady and Marion Wilson  and the zoo's first financial supporter Ellen Browning Scripps. 

The cubs are all very healthy and active according to the zoo keeper
