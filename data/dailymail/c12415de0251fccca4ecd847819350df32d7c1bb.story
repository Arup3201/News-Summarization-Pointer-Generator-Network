The owner of Championship football side Nottingham Forest has been found dead at his home in Lincolnshire.

Enormous sadness: Nottingham Forest confirmed club owner Nigel Doughty's death at his home in Lincolnshire

Mr Doughty was the co-founder of London-based private equity firm Doughty Hanson & Co and an assistant treasurer of the Labour Party.

He gave at least £3.5million to the Party over the past seven years.

A spokesman for the firm said tonight: 'On behalf of Dick Hanson and all the management and staff of Doughty Hanson, we are tremendously sorry to learn of the death of Nigel Doughty at home this afternoon.

'Our thoughts are very much with his family at this time.'

Meanwhile, Labour leaders past and present paid tribute to Mr Doughty with Ed Miliband describing him as a 'kind and generous man with a deep desire to make the world a better place'.

Forest, who are fighting to avoid relegation, take on east Midlands rivals Derby in the Championship at Pride Park on Sunday.

Life-long Forest fan Mr Doughty 
stepped down as chairman in October after a decade in the job following 
the sacking of former England manager Steve McClaren.

He was replaced in the role by former Forest player and manager Frank Clark.

Mr Doughty, who saved the Reds from administration when he bought the 
club for £11 million in 1999, has invested almost £100 million of his 
personal fortune in the club.

His son Michael Doughty, 19, is a midfielder for Premiership team Queens Park Rangers but is currently on loan to League Two team Crawley Town.

Following his death the football club 
released a statement which read 'It is with enormous sadness that 
Nottingham Forest announce the death of the club's owner Nigel Doughty.

'The club would like to appeal for the privacy of Mr Doughty's family to be observed at this sad time.

'The club will be making no further comment.'

Leading the tributes, Mr Miliband said in a statement: 'I am shocked and saddened to hear of Nigel Doughty's death. I was with him only a week ago and he was full of life, enthusiasm and vigour.

Tributes: Labour leader Ed Miliband and former Prime Minister Gordon Brown paid tribute to Mr Doughty today with Mr Brown describing him as a 'gentle giant'

'He was a kind, generous man with a deep desire to make the world a better place.

'My heart goes out to his wife Lucy and his children. We mourn his death deeply and will sorely miss him.'

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls tweeted: 'What terrible, tragic news: the untimely death of Nigel Doughty - Labour supporting, Notts Forest owning, visionary business leader.'

Former prime minister Gordon Brown said:
'Nigel Doughty will be remembered as a gentle giant, a good soft spoken
man with a deep commitment to public service who, from his great 
success in business, became one of our country's most generous 
benefactors.

'For all his life he was loyal to all the causes that he had grown up 
with - his love for his team Nottingham Forest, the Labour Party, of 
which he was a life long supporter, and charitable causes that benefited
from his generosity.
