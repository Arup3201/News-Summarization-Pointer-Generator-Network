Hillary Clinton has wasted no time cashing in on the lecture circuit as it was revealed today that she will be charging $200,000 per speech.

The massive fee means that she will be making more from a two-hour lecture than she did in a year as Secretary of State.

The announcement that Mrs Clinton has hired a top talent agency to represent her as she begins to give paid speeches following her departure from the State Department came earlier this week, but her $200,000 asking price was only reported on Wednesday.

Next gig: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has signed up with a talent agency and is commanding $200,000 per lecture, each of which will only last between one and two hours

According to Buzzfeed, that puts her in the same league as her husband former President Bill Clinton who is so in-demand that he can command the six-figure fee.

The volume of the sum is made clear when looked at in comparison to her salary for a year as Secretary of State, which was $186,000.

Mrs Clinton is now represented by the Harry Walker Agency which is known for getting famous politicians and newsmakers plum gigs on the lecture circuit.

The venture is her first formal decision about what she is going to do now that she is no longer working, though she is widely considered to be the Democratic front runner should she decide to run for the presidency in 2016.

Her decision to attach her name to his
 particular New York-based agency comes as little surprise since her 
husband former President Bill Clinton has long been represented by the 
group since he left office in 2000.

The move was clearly a lucrative one, as he made $75.6million from 2001 to 2010 from speaking engagements, making $10.7million in just 2010 alone.

President Clinton is not the only big 
name with the agency, as his former Vice President Al Gore has been 
booking $175,000 gigs through their connections, and former New York 
City mayor and Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani regularly brings in $100,000 per event.

Following suit: Former vice presidents Dick Cheney (left) and Al Gore (right) are also represented by The Harry Walker Agency and are said to command $100,000 per speaking engagement

Bill Clinton- an average of $181,000, but in 2010 alone he earned $10.7million and a total of $75.6million between 2001 and 2010

Al Gore- $175,000

John Kerry- While working as a Senator prior to his presidential bid in 2004, Kerry averaged $1,400 per speach

Dick Cheney- $75,000 and first class travel for a three-person entourage

Rudy Giuliani- $100,000 per event and he made $9.2million on a speaking tour from 2006 to 2007

Sarah Palin- $75,000 plus transportation

Bristol Palin- $14,000

Charlie Sheen- $200,000 per appearance along with the use of a private jet

Kim Kardashian- Reportedly earned $600,000 from Tao Nightclub in Las Vegas for an undisclosed number of events

Nicole 'Snooki' Polizzi- '$20,000 to walk the red carpet

Former vice president Dick Cheney, 
former Senators Olympia Snowe and Joe Lieberman, Obama campaign 
strategist Jim Messina and former Secretary General of the United 
Nations Kofi Annan are all represented by The Harry Walker Agency as 
well.

Her exact asking price has not been 
reported, but Politico asserts that she 'will likely do some speeches 
for no fee for causes she champions, and expects to occasionally donate 
her fees for charitable purposes'.

While keeping mum about any future 
presidential plans, Mrs Clinton has said that she plans to write another
 book, this time about her work as Secretary of State.

Publishing house Simon & Schuster 
reportedly paid the former first lady an $8million advance on her first 
book, Living History, which she published in December 2000.

With any and all positions that she 
decides to take, she will have to weigh the optics of if it would look 
appropriate for a presidential candidate.

That said, another concern is shoring 
up a steady income, because it doesn't come cheap to live like the 
Clintons and six-figure speaking fees will certainly help.

Equal standing: Hillary is reportedly asking for $200,000 per speech which is the same fee that Bill charges

Though there were early reports that 
they might buy a house in the Hamptons area of Long Island, it appears 
now that they will hustle between their current residences in 
Washington, D.C. and Chappaqua, a quiet town in the suburbs of New York 
City.

She is also expected to either work 
with her husband's Clinton Foundation or start her own, though no 
decisions about that have been made at this point.

The only thing that Mrs Clinton has 
publicly confirmed is that she plans to rest after a very taxing four 
years of traveling to 112 different countries.

As Mrs Clinton remains coy about her 
political prospects, her potential competitors are being very blatant in
 their fundraising attempts.

On the Republican side, both New 
Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Florida Senator Marco Rubio have 
raised significant sums for their campaign war chests in recent weeks.

Mr Christie attended a fundraiser in 
his honor at Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's California home, and Mr 
Rubio raised $100,000 by selling water bottles with his name on them, 
playing on his thirst-quenching gaffe during the State of the Union 
rebuttal.
