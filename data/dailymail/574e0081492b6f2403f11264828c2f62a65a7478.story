Chancellor George Osborne has risked causing a rift in the Coalition after putting plans for a third runway at Heathrow 'back on the table', it has been claimed.

Mr Osborne has persuaded David Cameron to push for a U-turn on plans for expansion at Heathrow, in a move which has reportedly infuriated Nick Clegg by overturning a key manifesto pledge.

The Chancellor has refused to rule out expanding Britain's biggest airport because he believes it is key to our 'hub status' and essential to Britain's economic future, according to the Independent on Sunday.

Full to capacity: Experts claimed not expanding Heathrow would cost the UK economy up to £8.5bn a year

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, along with environmental campaigners and Transport Secretary Justine Greening are all among those said to be furious at the move.

The newspaper said that Mr Osborne introduced Heathrow as a possible venue for expansion at a Cabinet meeting this month.

Earlier this month a report suggested that the UK economy will suffer by up to £8.5billion per year over the next decade if Heathrow does not undergo significant expansion.

If expansion were to go ahead it would not happen until after the next election.

A strategy review on aviation, combined with a paper on 'hub status', is due later this summer.

Rift: The plan by George Osborne to put Heathrow expansion 'back on the table' is said to have infuriated Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg

Just five months ago plans for Heathrow expansion were said to have been 'off the agenda' after Labour apparently joined the Coalition in ruling out the third runway.

Mr Osborne appeared to back the decision when his Autumn Statement in November declared that he would consider all options for South-east airport expansion, with the exception of Heathrow.

Activists had opposed plans for an expansion at Heathrow on the grounds of disturbance and pollution from aircraft.

Possible plans revealed last year showed how Heathrow could look if expansion went ahead

The plans for a third runway have been met with constant strong opposition from local residents near the proposed site

Alternative: One of the other options proposed has been an airport hub on the Thames estuary which would hold up to 150 million passengers a year

Both Labour and Liberal Democrat manifestos in 2010 had promised there would be no third runway at Heathrow, but other factors appear to have now changed the mind of the Chancellor.

Chief among those is a fear that Britain is being left behind by Euro rivals competing for business from Brazil and China.

Alternatives to Heathrow expansion include improving RAF Northolt in Ruislip, Middlesex for business flights, just 13 miles away.

Expansion at Gatwick has also been suggested but is not thought to be a popular idea, while the controversial 'Boris Island' airport in the Thames estuary would take too long to build, according to some.
