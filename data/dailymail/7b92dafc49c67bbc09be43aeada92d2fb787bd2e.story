Her good looks and dancing talents clearly caught the eye of Prince Harry and now the royal ex's skills have landed her a major modelling job. 

Cressida Bonas has been snapped up to star in Mulberry's upcoming video.

While the 25-year-old dancer isn't the face of the brand - a position currently held by her friend Cara Delevingne - Mulberry confirmed to FEMAIL that Cressida is their new 'muse'.

Cressida Bonas, who dazzled in a white Mulberry dress at the BAFTA tea party in Los Angeles over the weekend, has been snapped up to perform and dance in an upcoming  Mulberry video

Cressida will star in a new video by the British label, during which she shows off her  dance skills with a mixture of 'improvised' and rehearsed steps. 

Speaking about her coup, the blonde thespian told Yahoo Style: 'I think it was just about being free and happy, and having fun.

'The idea was, "dance as if you're dancing in your kitchen". It was more about a dance that was improvised, and not all about the steps. It was really just about having fun.'

The blonde beauty - who appears in the short film alongside actor Freddie Fox - was cast in the ads after talent spotters at her final dance performance before her graduation from the University of Leeds were 'charmed by her movement which inspired the concept'.

The video, which is set to be released in March, made its debut in Los Angeles over the weekend at a star-studded party, with guests including fellow Mulberry model Cara Delevingne and Keira Knightley.

The British-born model has been holding court with the A-listers at recent events in Los Angeles.

The former girlfriend of Prince Harry headed up a Brit pack including Cara Delevingne, Keira Knightley and the ladies of hit TV show Downton Abbey as they partied in the sunshine town.

And it seems trained dancer Cressida, who is making her acting debut next year, fit right in with the crowd of actors and film producers.  

She was spotted chatting  to Downton star Joanne Froggatt at the event, which was held ahead of the Golden Globes.

The party is an annual affair and was held at the beautiful Four Seasons Hotel in Beverley Hills. 

Cressida - who dated Prince Harry on and off for two years - has made no secret of her desire to have her own career and was recently praised by movie mogul Harvey Weinstein.

He said: 'Cressida is great in Tulip Fever and people will see what a fantastic actress she is... it will be the first of many roles for her,' said Weinstein.

The aristocrat is  set to star in Harvey's film Tulip Fever, alongside Cara and Dame Judy Dench, playing Mrs Steen, a merchant's wife.

Harvey went on to praise Cressida for not using her relationship with Prince Harry to her advantage, saying: 'She is not taking advantage of any media profile.' 

Although she and Harry have remained close friends it is thought that Cressida struggled with dating the Prince. 

It was widely reported that she did not wish to enter into the royal way of life and be thrust into the spotlight because of her romance.
