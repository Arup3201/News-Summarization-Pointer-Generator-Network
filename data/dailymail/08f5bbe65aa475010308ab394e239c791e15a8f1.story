A daughter, who never knew the story of her heroic father's life, will receive eight medals for bravery awarded to him today after they were discovered by accident in the laundry room of an apartment block.  

Hyla Merin, of Westlake Village, California, will receive a series of honors awarded to her father 2nd Lt Hyman Markel for his bravery in World War II.

The medals, including a Purple Heart and a distinguished Silver Star - awarded for gallantry, have begun her long road to discovering the story of her father, a heroic Rabbi's son who died protecting others against German troops just five months before she was born.

Mystery: Hyla Merin, left, was never told the story of her father Hyman Markel, right. She is piecing together his story after a box of medals awarded to him were recently discovered

'It just confirms what a great man he was,' Merin said tearfully. 'He gave up his life for our country and our freedom. I'll put it up in my house as a memorial to him and to those who served.'

'It was a very difficult topic for [my mother]. When my father died, she was seven months pregnant.'

Markel was killed on May 3, 1945, in Italy's Po Valley while fighting German troops as an officer with the 88th Division of the 351st Infantry Regiment. 

According to research by Purple Hearts Reunited - a charity which reunites families with lost medals - he was awarded posthumously after courageously offering his life to save others.  

Zachariah Fike, the Vermont Army National Guard captain who founded Purple Hearts Reunited said: 'The accounts suggest that he was out on patrol and he got ambushed and he charged ahead and basically took out a machine gun position to save the rest of his guys. For that, he paid the ultimate sacrifice.'

Merin's mother, Celia Markel, was given most of the medals but for some reason never received the Silver Star.

The young widow was clearly traumatized by losing her first love and rarely spoke to her daughter about him.

In the 1960s she moved into a West Hollywood apartment where she stored a box of precious mementos of her late husband - including the medals - in a laundry room looker.

They remained there forgotten about until September last year when the manager of the building stumbled upon them and contacted the veteran's charity.

Merin wrote about the shock of receiving the call on Facebook.

'OMG! Got a call this am from the apt manager where we lived when I was a kid . My aunt moved out 3 years ago. They opened a locker and found pictures of my dad, his purple heart, and other special memorabilia ! Can't wait to see them tomorrow morning! I cried with happiness and anticipation all morning!'

'I don't have a lot of pictures, I don't have a lot of stories, and I've always been a crier,' she explained.

'My mother was always the stoic one, very strong.'

Now Merin is patching together the life of her father - a man who excelled at mathematics and met his young wife at a Jewish temple in Buffalo, New York, in 1941 - already a serving army officer.

As well as the medals, the box contained photos, her father's prayer book and letters which tell the story of Markel's life and death

'I found it very hard to look at. A lot of them were condolence letters,' Merin said.

She told her mother of the discovery and the undelivered Silver Star but she sadly died earlier this month at the age of 94, before the family was reunited with them.

She briefly remarried when her daughter was 10 but tragically lost her second husband three years later.

Merin will also receive the Silver Star thanks to the work of the veteran's charity.
