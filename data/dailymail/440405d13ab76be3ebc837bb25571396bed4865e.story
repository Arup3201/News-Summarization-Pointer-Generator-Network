Drunk driver: Darren Byng, 45, has left a couple with a £50,000 repair bill after he ploughed a stolen Jaguar car into a couple's £175,000, four-bedroom home in Thornton-Cleveleys, Manchester

A drunk driver has left a couple with a £50,000 repair bill after he ploughed a stolen Jaguar into the side of their home.

Darren Byng, 45, took the luxury X-Type vehicle  after an afternoon of drinking at his home in Fleetwood, Lancashire.

He drove for a few miles before he lost control of the car and crashed into the four-bedroom home of Brian and Susan Nuttall.

The couple, who were looking after two grandchildren at the time, said the car's impact was so big 'it felt like the house was going to down'.

Three palm trees, worth £2,000 each, were also uprooted when the vehicle veered onto the grass.

The pair believe it was only through sheer luck that nobody was injured, as their two-year-old grandson Charlie was sleeping upstairs.

Mr Nuttall, 66, was sat in the living room when the car careered into the side of the house.

They had to be evacuated from their £175,000 property in Thornton-Cleveleys, Lancashire, while Byng, who initially tried to walk off, told police he was sorry for crashing his 'mate's car'.

He added: 'I shouldn’t have been driving. I don’t have a licence. I’m not a nasty person.'

It emerged Byng was banned from the roads at the time and was three times the drink drive limit, later claiming he drank 50 pints of beer every week.

Mr and Mrs Nuttall, who have four children and six grandchildren, have been forced to start major repair work on their home, which they have lived in for 23 years.

The extensive restoration will involve the rebuilding of a gable wall and a chimney stack, and repairs to the living room.

They were forced to live with their son for two weeks as firemen cut off the gas supply because of fears it could cause an explosion.

Byng was jailed for 12 months at Preston Crown Court after admitting aggravated vehicle taking, drink driving and driving whilst banned and without insurance.

He was banned from driving for a further five years and was only ordered to pay £100 victim surcharge, despite causing thousands of pounds worth of damage.

But Mrs Nuttall, 62, a retired supermarket supervisor said: 'He should have got longer in jail. I couldn’t believe it when I saw the damage.

'On the night it happened there was the shock of the house being shunted then the horrific noise the house made. It sounded like it was falling down. We looked out of the window and we saw this great big car sat on our garden.

'Considering the state of him already being disqualified from driving I think it is disgusting he was on the road in the first place.

'He could have killed anyone walking around the corner. There are little kids playing in the street all the time, he could have easily mowed a little girl down.'

'The firemen explained he hit the concrete post on the fence before the chimney and if he hadn’t hit that the car would have been sat in the lounge.

'Somebody was smiling down on us because normally Charlie is playing in the living room but he had been to nursery and was tired so luckily he was upstairs.

Damage: The pair will also have to pay to replace their prized palm trees, which were knocked over

Distraught: They lost three palm trees, worth £2,000 each

'Otherwise he would have been right by the fire when the house shook. It was so powerful our next-door neighbours felt their house shake and came out to see what was going on. Now if you are upstairs and hear a loud engine it does make you sit up whereas before I didn’t take any notice.

As well as the damage to the house, part-time energy consultant Mr Nuttall, 66, lost three palm trees worth £2,000 each.

He said: 'When the surveyors come to check on the house they will have to take down the chimney breast to see if there is more damage so we will have to move somewhere else while they do that for however long. It’s caused a big upheaval.

'The insurance have been and will put it right. The cost will be £50,000 plus some of the things like the palm trees we aren’t insured for. No doubt our premiums will be sky high next time.'

Byng, of Fleetwood, had previously been banned from driving for five years and should have taken a retest before going back on the road. But on February 6 he went to the pub before walking to his friend’s address where they began drinking wine and shots.

The friend later noticed that his car had gone, as well as the keys. The court heard Mrs Nuttall was in her front bedroom when she heard 'an almighty bang and felt the whole bedroom shake.'

'She thought the house was going to fall down,' said Jeremy Grout Smith, prosecuting.

They went out and Byng was sat in the driver’s seat of the car, trying to start it up. Mrs Nuttall ordered him to remain at the scene - but simply walked off down the street, despite her efforts to get him to go into the house until the police arrived.

Two officers later found Byng, who held his arms out in front and was immediately handcuffed.The Jaguar was written off.

Interior: The impact also caused parts of the fireplace to break and fall onto the living room floor

In mitigation, Byng’s lawyer Paul Robinson said: 'A number of factors conspired together to cause him to behave in this fashion that night.

'Since these offences he has not consumed anything stronger than lager and shandy. He has shown remorse.'

But Judge Jacqueline Beech told Byng: 'You pose a high risk of reoffending. This offence is too serious for anything other than an immediate sentence of imprisonment.'
