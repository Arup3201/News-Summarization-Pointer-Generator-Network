Call me chairman! the BBC Trust's first female boss Rona Fairhead starts work today

The first female boss of the BBC Trust insisted on being called chairman not chairwoman as she started work today.

Rona Fairhead, who will be paid £110,000 a year for a three day week, has taken over from former cabinet minister Lord Patten who stood down in May.

But in an  email to all BBC staff this morning she confirmed there would be no change of title.

She wrote: 'Dear Everyone, Today is my first day as Chairman and I wanted to write to say 'hello' and to say how excited I am to be joining this great organization. I feel privileged to be here and can't wait to get started'. 

The chairman has taken over after torrid few years that have seen the corporation lambasted for its handling of the Jimmy Savile scandal, and a Newsnight investigation that led to the late Lord McAlpine being wrongly accused of child abuse.

The BBC was also heavily criticised over excessive payouts given to senior staff including £470,000 to former director-general George Entwistle after only 54 days in the job and £680,000 to former chief operating officer Caroline Thomson. 

Deputy director general Mark Byford departed the BBC with a total payout of £949,000.

In her email  she said she had spent time with director-general Tony Hall and other senior executives in recent weeks.

She said: 'They are under no illusions about the challenging environment; the changing viewing patterns, the explosion of choice and the rapid changes in technologies and markets. They understand that they need to operate efficiently and to rectify some of the high profile issues of the past, while building this compelling future.'

The former chief executive of the Financial Times group also said in her email she would 'defend vigorously the BBC's independence while holding it accountable to its audience'.

She will have to deal with pressure to scrap its traditional funding method - the licence fee - which has been much criticised by politicians, performers and former corporation staff in the run-up to the renewal of its charter, which expires in 2016. 

Mrs Fairhead, whose husband Tom is a private equity boss and former Conservative councillor, was also asked about a £1.1million severance payment she received last year from Pearson, the parent company of the Financial Times.

Asked whether it would compromise her ability to crack down on excessive payoffs at the BBC, she said: 'I would hope not. It is clearly a lot of money. But I have to say those were relatively standard within my industry for the level of the role that I had and for what I had done. It was done entirely within contractual terms.

'I'm not going to apologise that I came from the private sector.'

Scandal: The resignation of George Entwistle is one of a number of crises the BBC has faced in recent years

In August Mastermind was accused of gender bias after it emerged most of its questions last week were about men. 

During the first episode of the latest series, screened in August, host John Humphrys asked 81 general knowledge questions to the four contestants.

Of those, only five were about real or fictional women, 38 were about men and the rest were about things.

The imbalance quickly attracted the ire of some viewers on the BBC's own Points of View Messageboard, an online forum on which diehard fans air their views.

One posted: 'Was it just tonight or do Mastermind questions always overwhelmingly refer to men or things but rarely women?' 

John Inverdale has been axed from his role covering Wimbledon for BBC Radio 5 Live after he sparked a sexism storm.

In the summer of 2013 the BBC was bombarded with complaints when Inverdale suggested French player Marion Bartoli - who went on to become women's champion - was 'not much of a looker'.

Just days after Inverdale claimed the gaffe was due to hayfever, the corporation announced Clare Balding would be replacing him on the radio station for this year's tournament. 

Mrs Fairhead has been criticised for owning almost £5million worth of shares in Pearson because the company has a deal to publish BBC branded educational books.

She said she would sell them if she was advised it would be a 'clear conflict of interest' not to do so.

Defending her £110,000 BBC salary for a three-day week, she said: 'It's the salary that I was told had been decided by the Government, so it's a given. I know that if I stayed in the private sector a chairman role would attract a much, much larger salary.'

Becoming the BBC Trust's first female chairman is a landmark moment.

In the past the corporation has been accused of 'absurd political correctness' linked to gender equality, including recently cutting the word 'girl' from a documentary about the Commonwealth Games, fearing it might cause 'offence'. 

Last year veteran journalist Selina Scott described the BBC as having a 'sexist culture' for decades where 'when a woman's age exceeded her bra size she was finished'.

'Those of us who have worked at the Corporation over the past three decades know this once-great institution has been open to many forms of corruption – including sexual,' she told the Mail on Sunday. 

'Over the years I have often returned to the BBC to work on programmes and my observations of the sexist culture have always been the same. That some of the often Oxbridge- educated powerful male elite behave in a predatory way towards attractive and ambitious women seeking to move up the Corporation's greasy pole'.
