Wimbledon champion Andy Murray and girlfriend Kim Sears have jetted off to the Bahamas for a relaxing break following his historic grand slam victory.

The tennis ace tweeted earlier today: 'Just got off flight... nice five day 
break coming up before training starts again next Saturday... Going to 
eat a lot and do very little else!'

But while Andy was meant to be enjoying a break from tennis he still had time to indulge his racquet skills as he was pictured with a beach bat and ball.

Giving her tips? The couple pause for a chat during their rally on the tropical shoreline 

The couple laughed as they had a rally on the shoreline beside the tropical aquamarine water and rather than a traditional handshake, ended their match with a hug.

Kim wore a Ted Baker dress over a yellow swimsuit and tied her famously voluminous hair back in a ponytail.

Meanwhile Andy showed off his athletic physique in long, blue swimming shorts.

After their game of beach ball the happy couple then raced one another back up the beach with big grins on their faces.

Andy, 26, has had plenty to smile about recently after becoming the first British man in 77 years to win at Wimbledon.

The historic win is set to net him a fortune in endorsements. One high-end brand already rumoured to be keen to snap the sportsman up is Burberry.

Love all: The couple ended their game with a hug

A ring for Kim? Andy said after Wimbledon that he hadn't thought about proposing to his girlfriend of seven years yet but added 'you never know'

The Mail On Sunday reported yesterday that  creative director Christopher Bailey is keen to sign both Andy and Kim, 25, up on a modelling contract to appear on new billboard adverts.

It is thought Murray’s manager Simon 
Fuller, who also looks after the Beckhams, has been instrumental in 
orchestrating talks, although there has not been an official 
announcement.

‘Andy may not seem like the obvious choice for a 
fashion campaign, but he has proven he can scrub up incredibly well,’ 
said a source. ‘He is in great shape and has that great bone structure which Burberry loves. Kim is gorgeous and has amazing hair.’

The pair certainly looked every inch the model couple during their Bahamas break.

Many might wonder if Andy will use the romantic setting to finally pop the question to his girlfriend of seven years. The couple live together in Surrey and have two dogs.

The question of marriage is one Andy faced continually following his Wimbledon win against world number one Novak Djokovic.

When asked in the press conference following the match if he planned to propose he replied: 'No… I haven’t thought about that yet.'

He was then pushed on the matter again by TV presenter Holly Willoughby the next day and he retorted: 'I only met you like ten minutes ago so I wouldn't be telling you first.'

But he coyly added: 'You never know'.

Speaking of his relationship with Kim he explained: 'It has been getting close to eight years that we have been together. She has been with me since the second time I played Wimbledon, just after the first summer I played.

'It has been good because her dad is a tennis coach and he still travels on the tour. She understands the sport well and is used to being away from her dad from a young age. She understands that sort of distant relationship, and yes it works well.'

Now he has won Wimbledon Andy has said he has no plans to rest on his laurels. Following his holiday he'll be back in training with the aim of winning more grand slam trophies, starting with defending his U.S. Open title in New York next month.
