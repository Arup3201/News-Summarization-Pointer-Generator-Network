Probe: Tory MP Nadine Dorries's travel and accommodation expenses are to be probed by The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority

Controversial Tory politician Nadine Dorries is being investigated over her MP's expenses.

The Tory, who is MP for Mid-Bedfordshire, is being probed for claims made for accommodation and travel, watchdog the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) announced today

Ms Dorries had previously been investigated in 2010 where she agreed to pay back £1,000.

She was also threatened with expulsion from the Conservative party last year after deciding to go on I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here! in the Australian jungle.

Ipsa's compliance officer Peter Davis said he had reason to believe Ms Dorries may have been paid travel and accommodation costs she was not entitled to.

'An investigation will be conducted into claims submitted under the following areas of the third and fourth editions of the MPs’ scheme of business costs and expense - accommodation expenditure, travel and subsistence,' he said in a statement.

Just this morning Ms Dorries tweeted that she was taking some holiday as Parliament broke for its half term recess.

'I'm taking a break from Twitter for the half term week and spending some time getting some fresh air with my three girls. #bonding', she wrote.

A defiant Ms Dorries vowed to 'go after' Ipsa, claiming the expenses body had simply targeted a high-profile MP to justify its funding.

She insisted she was 'totally relaxed' about the allegations, saying they were completely unfounded.

One relates to a travel ticket claim that was submitted twice in error by a member of staff who had accidentally 'pressed the button twice', she said.

'Ipsa was asleep on the bloody job not filtering out claims like that,' she added.

Ms Dorries said Ipsa was also accusing her of subletting her flat because an electricity bill for a three-month period when her daughter was home from university was higher than her normal bills.

'I have never misclaimed one penny on my expenses,' she said.

Ms Dorries remains suspended from the Tory whip following her appearance last year on ITV's I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here!.

She added: 'They need a high-profile MP to go after to justify their millions in funding. Well I'm going to go after them.

'All they want to do is get attention to show Ipsa is doing its job.'

Controversial: Ms Dorries went into the jungle to talk about abortion issues and life as an MP but she also took part in several grim challanges

Ms Dorries claimed to have had permission to take time off from Westminster to go to Australia from then-Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell but admitted she did not tell him it was to take part in the show.

She also claimed that other MPs have also taken long spells away from Westminster. She attacked Labour MP Stephen McCabe on Twitter for reporting her to the standards commissioner, telling him his own attendance rate was just 63 per cent.

But he responded, pointing out that he had taken time off to recover from having open heart surgery.

Mr McCabe wrote on Twitter: 'Imagine equating time off for open heart surgery with a paid for holiday on a reality TV show. Says all we need to know.'

But Ms Dorries was unrepentant, replying: 'I think with your 63% attendance record, you should be quiet. Obvioulsy been taking a few holidays of your own!'

The Mid Bedfordshire MP claimed she wanted to use her appearance on I'm A Celebrity to discuss political issues, including lowering the abortion limit, in front of a TV audience of millions.

But none of the political conversations were aired.

Instead she was seen eating an ostrich anus and camel toe in a Bushtucker Trial and performing a series of bad jokes with Linda Robson from Birds of a Feather.
