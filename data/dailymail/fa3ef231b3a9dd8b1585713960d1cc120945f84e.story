An ABC News presenter has received a tasteless postcard from a viewer warning her she does not 'need to look butch to work on the ABC'. 

Presenter Virginia Trioli has shared the latest letter to criticise her appearance with her followers on social media - with the hashtag #herewegoagain. 

The handwritten letter, signed with the name James Jacobs-Wolfe, said: 'Just a little bit of artistic advice, toss out the horn rims, they make you look like a contestant on a make-over TV show.

ABC host Virginia Trioli has received a postcard from one 'fan', who bluntly told her: 'Just a little bit of artistic advice, toss out the horn rims, they make you look like a contestant on a make-over TV show'

Presenter Virginia Trioli has shared the latest letter to criticise her appearance with her followers on social media - with the hashtag #herewegoagain

'You have a good face so why hide it? You don't have to look butch to work on the ABC. Your weather girl doesn't.' 

Trioli is not averse to sharing mail that focuses on superficial things with her 50,000 Twitter followers.

She received an anonymous letter in October which she captioned 'Mails in #justagirlonabudget'. In the harsh letter, she was instructed that she should stop wearing 'blacks and browns' because they are 'very ageing'.

The handwritten memo started off by saying: 'I watch you every morning,' and went on to tell Trioli she should change her glasses.

'Next the glasses ugh! Go for the light coloured frames, as with your dark eyes, black make you look "owlish". You will be very pleasantly surprised,' they said.

The rude writer asked 'dare I say it, did you obtain your clothes from charity shops?'.

'This letter is NOT meant to insult you but so that you look 40 not 60,' they add. 

She has spoken out about viewers' focus on female presenters' appearance in the past, and she's far from alone when it comes to receiving abuse on her attire.

In October, Ms Trioli told the Guardian Australia that she often receives comments from viewers about her looks.

'My reaction is just to be myself and not let it occupy a tiny bit of my time. I can’t afford for it to be a distraction, I have to get through three hours of live TV every day,' she said.

In October 2013, Today host Lisa Wilkinson shared some of crude correspondence she has received about her looks in her Andrew Olle lecture. 

'Who the heck is Lisa's stylist? Whoever it is has Lisa in some shocking clothes. Today's outfit is particularly jarring and awful... Get some style,' wrote Angela, a letter writer.

Wilkinson responded: 'Please feel free to send me a list of all the outfits you don't like out of the 200 or so that I come up with each year, and I'll see what I can do.

'Of course Angela, given that I am a journalist - and not a supermodel - it is important that anything I wear allows me to feel comfortable for three and a half hours on set or perhaps outside when we're on location.'

She never heard back.
