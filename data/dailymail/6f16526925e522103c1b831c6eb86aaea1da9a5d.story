Terrorist groups are working on a bomb that can make it through airport security undetected, it is feared.

The Department of Homeland Security is demanding increased security at overseas airports linking to America after indications of a joint plot between groups in Yemen and Syria.

U.S. officials were reported to be concerned about the al-Qa’ida-affiliate group the Al Nusrah Front in Syria, which they said has teamed up with Yemen-based Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula

That latter group was behind the 'underwear bomb' which failed to detonate in a plane over Detroit in 2009. Now it is feared they could be working on bombs which would be implanted inside would be terrorists to evade security.

Increased checks: Security at American airports and those overseas with direct flights to States is to be tightened after US officials raised fears about terrorists in Syria and Yemen developing explosives that could be smuggled onto planes

The official who revealed the concerns
 spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorised
 to discuss the matter publicly by name.

The
 Times reported that US officials believe terrorists may be working on a
 'stealth' bomb which is undetectable by current security checks.

The new explosives may be non-metallic or plastic and could be surgically implanted inside a terrorist's body.

Terror groups have been using Syria, large parts of which are under the control of jihadists, as a testing ground.

Homeland
 Security Secretary Jeh Johnson says the U.S. is sharing recent and 
relevant information with foreign allies. He says the government is also
 consulting with the aviation industry.

The
 Obama administration is now reportedly considering a complete overhaul 
of its system of security checks at the U.S.’s international airports – 
and is looking to ask its overseas partners to do the same.

It
 is thought that they could include increased random screening of 
passengers and tighter scrutiny of footwear and on-board mobile phones 
and computers.

ABC News 
quoted one defence source as saying the threat, discussed at the White 
House over the course of the past week by senior intelligence agencies, 
is 'different and more disturbing' than previous plots.

'We
 remain concerned about the capability of some of these elements to 
develop weapons that could be thwarted by our current security systems,'
 said a statement by Homeland Security.

Officials
 say there is no imminent threat or plot. However, an additional 
vulnerability has been identified, which the Department of Homeland 
Security is currently working to address.

'The
 Department of Homeland Security is regularly reviewing our security 
procedures to adapt to the threat that we — that is faced by our 
transportation system, as advisories are required to adequately inform 
the traveling public, we’ll make those announcements.'

Representative Peter King addressed the threat on ABC’s This Week

'A
 number of airports do not have the type of security that they should 
have. Basically, we’re saying anyone that would fly to the U.S., they 
would have to increase their security. We’re going to be pushing it, but
 overseas airport security is a real concern.'

The
 threat has grown all the more severe as chaos in Syria and Iraq has 
created a safe haven for terror groups to train, plan and recruit 
westerners to join their fight.

'Allowing
 them to pool up in Syria, allowing them to have safe haven the size of 
Indiana, between Syria and Iraq, and I say they, al Qaeda-minded 
individuals that now have an army.

'That
 is as dangerous a time for an al Qaeda threat to the United States as 
I’ve ever seen.'

In recent months, U.S. officials have warned about al 
Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula terrorists attempting to design new 
explosive devices to avoid detection.

Concerned: Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington. Johnson is ordering increased security measures at some overseas airports offering direct flights to the United States

In
 February, the government warned airlines about possible shoe bombs, 
officials told CNN at the time, amid intelligence suggesting tactics 
tied to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula master bomb-maker Ibrahim al 
Asiri.

A law enforcement 
source said the U.S. periodically receives information on attempts by 
those believed to have been trained by al Asiri to develop bombs that 
could defeat screening systems.

Security is also being increased at British airports in direct relation to America's heightened precautions.

Britain's
 Department for Transport said the extra measures - which have not been 
disclosed - were not expected to cause 'significant disruption' to 
passengers and noted that the official UK threat status remained 
unchanged,

Unclear: The Homeland Security Department would not immediately say  whether the increased measures were in response to intelligence about a specific threat

Changes were 
announced after Washington Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson 
ordered beefed up security at foreign airports from where aircraft fly 
directly to the US.

'The UK 
Government keeps aviation security under constant review in conjunction 
with international partners and the aviation industry,' a DfT spokesman 
said.

'We have taken the 
decision to step up some of our aviation security measures. For obvious 
reasons we will not be commenting in detail on those changes.'

'The
 majority of passengers should not experience significant disruption. 
There will be no change to the threat level, which remains at 
substantial.'

'The safety 
and security of the public is our paramount concern. The UK has some of 
the most robust aviation security measures and we will continue to take 
all the steps necessary to ensure that public safety is maintained.'

US
 officials were reported to have said the move was the result of 
intelligence that groups in Yemen and Syria had joined forces to plot an
 attack.

Prime Minister 
David Cameron's official spokesman said: 'There are terror organizations
 around the world that seek to do the UK, its citizens, citizens of many
 other countries including our Western allies, harm.

'We need to always be vigilant to situations that can develop.'
