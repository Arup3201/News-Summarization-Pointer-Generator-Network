No, you're not seeing things. The video below may look as if it stars half a dozen identical skateboarders but it is in fact that same talented 14-year-old.

The impressive footage combines more than 60 takes of young skater Cory Juneau.

It was then collapsed together in post-production to produce seven stunning sequences which makes it look as though Juneau is skating in perfect co-ordination with seven or eight clones.

Incredibly, the video was shot on mobile phone - a Lumia 930 - by filmmaker Cy Kuckenbaker.

Cory, from San Diego in California, is already a regular on the professional skating scene, taking on competitors twice his age.

Here, he deftly shows off his skills, performing tricks and jumps in quick succession.

At one point it looks as though there is a row of skaters lined up along the edge of the skate park, who then head back down the ramp in quick succession.

The dopplegangers seem to miss each other by just inches as they perform a series of dizzying twists and turns before exiting the park one by one.
