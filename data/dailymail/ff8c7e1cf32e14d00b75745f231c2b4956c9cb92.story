A writer who worked on hit HBO series Sex and the City has revealed that there were 'big arguments' about whether or not the show's central character Carrie Bradshaw should end up with her on-again-off-again lover Mr Big. 

In an interview with Elle.com, Liz Tuccillo admitted that the show's writing team were on the fence about how to end the final season of the series, in which Carrie is swept off her feet by long-time love Big while in Paris.

Surprisingly however, the arguments were not due to doubts over which man shoe fan Carrie, who was played by actress Sarah Jessica Parker, would end up with, but rather because the team were unsure whether she and her co-stars should all end up in the arms of a man.

'... Carrie Bradshaw couldn't be happy unless she had a guy,' Liz, 50, said. 

'That's what kills me.You want to know something serious? That was the big argument when we were ending the show. All of us were arguing about it. 

'Not just that she ends up with Big, because I think we all knew, even if we didn’t want to admit it, that she was going to end up with Big. But the fact that all of the women end up with someone. 

'That was a huge conversation in the writer’s room. We felt a big responsibility to end the show right. And by having every character with somebody, it means that ultimately, the show is about finding love in the big city and we’re going to be optimists and say that everybody’s found it. Everybody’s happy.'

Eventually, the show's writers went with their initial instincts, and in the last episode of the sixth and final series, an estimated 10.6 million fans watched as Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda all ended their six-year run on-air in happy relationships.

It was, Liz added, the perfect way for Carrie to find true happiness. 

'For Carrie Bradshaw, specifically, she believes in love, and her idea of love is always with that perfect guy,' she said. 

'Or not perfect, at all. Perfect for her. That's what she would choose as her happy ending. And we wanted to write that for her.' 

Shortly after the final episode of Sex and the City aired on HBO, Parker, who also served as an executive producer on the show, told TV host Larry King that she was 'thrilled' with the final ending.

'I was really thrilled; I was very pleased,' she said. 

'And I think the most gratifying part of it is that I just think the viewers seem to be  happy with the choices we've made. 

'And that of a great concern to me that we did right by them... I feel that they have been an enormous part of this show and any success that we've experienced. 

'And so I wanted very much for them to feel that we didn't bail, that we did right by them and that we honored the characters that we had been playing and illustrating for so long.'

Mr Big

Fans were thrilled to see Carrie end up in the arms of Big, with whom she had enjoyed an on-again-off-again relationship which spanned all six seasons of the show. While their turbulent six-year relationship was not always the easiest of romances, both actress Sarah Jessica Parker and Sex and the City director Michael Patrick King later revealed that they knew deep down he was the person Carrie was meant to end up with.

Aidan Shaw

The only people sad to see Carrie and Big finally find happiness were those who had been rooting for her lovable ex-boyfriend Aidan. The furniture designer did all he could to win the heart of Ms Bradshaw - including moving into her apartment and proposing - but the couple were unable to make it work in the end.

Jack Berger

Opinions were divided over whether or not Berger was a suitable match for Carrie. While they seemed compatible on the surface, Berger's insecurity about his own career eventually led to the end of their brief relationship when he broke up with Carrie on a post-it note.

Aleksandr Petrovsky

Russian artist Aleksandr came into Carrie's life during the final season of the show, when he whisked her away from her friends and her life in New York, in favor of a whirlwind romance in Paris. Once there however, their romance falters, leaving Big with the perfect opportunity to stage a romantic rescue and return Carrie safely home to New York.
