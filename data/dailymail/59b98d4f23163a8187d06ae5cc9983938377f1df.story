Doctors and nurses were given a green light yesterday to take a hand in killing desperately sick or disabled patients.

Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said that rules which say doctors, medical workers and carers should be prosecuted for helping patients to commit suicide are wrong.

In future, she said lawyers at the Crown Prosecution Service should only bring charges when the doctor or carer ‘may have exerted some influence on the victim’.

Her order to CPS lawyers brought furious condemnation from anti-euthanasia campaigners who accused Mrs Saunders of legalising assisted suicide and opening the way for suicide hospitals in Britain on the model of the Dignitas clinic in Zurich.

Alison Saunders' order to CPS lawyers has sparked outrage among anti-euthanasia campaigners

The Care Not Killing group said: ‘She is effectively at a stroke of her pen decriminalising assisted suicide by doctors and other health care professionals as long as they don’t have an existing relationship with the patient.’

The DPP was also accused of changing the law to allow doctors to help suicides without reference to Parliament or even the courts.

The switch in prosecution policy, announced in a CPS statement yesterday afternoon, comes at a time when peers and MPs are set to debate a bill aimed precisely at democratic reform of the law so that doctors can kill terminally ill patients.

Lord Falconer’s Assisted Dying Bill, due to go to its committee stage in the Lords next month, would allow doctors to provide lethal drugs to someone who has been diagnosed as terminally ill and who is expected to die within six months. Two doctors would have to sign that the death was above board.

However the DPP’s ruling yesterday appears to free doctors from the threat of prosecution even if the patient they kill is not already dying from a terminal illness.

The law on assisted suicide, laid down by Parliament in 1961, sets a maximum jail sentence of 14 years for anyone who aids and abets a suicide. This was effectively amended in 2010 by Mrs Saunders’ predecessor as DPP, Keir Starmer, who was asked to write prosecution guidelines in a Law Lords test case decision.

Alison Saunders, Director of Public Prosecutions, has said prosecutions should only be brought when the carer has exerted influence over the patient's decision to commit suicide

The result of Mr Starmer’s guidelines is that no-one has been prosecuted for helping a Briton travel to die at the Dignitas clinic, even though many of the 150 Zurich British suicides have had help from relatives or friends. The Starmer rules mean in practice that no-one will be prosecuted unless they help to kill someone out of greed or malice.

The 2010 guidelines said that prosecutions should be brought against medical professionals and carers where ‘the victim was in his or her care.’

Mrs Saunders’ new rule follows rulings by the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal in the case of Tony Nicklinson, a paralysed stroke victim who died in 2012, but who had asked the courts to allow someone to kill him by injecting him with a lethal drug. 

The Supreme Court judges hinted in June that they favoured assisted suicide but drew back from telling Parliament that the 1961 law breaks European human rights rules.

The DPP said her new guideline was made ‘in the light of the recent comments of the Supreme Court.’

She said prosecutors should in future concentrate on the words ‘the victim was in his or her care’. 

She also added her own footnote to the Starmer rules, which said that no medical professional should be prosecuted ‘merely because someone was acting in a professional capacity.’

They should consider prosecuting only when there was ‘a relationship of care between the suspect and the victim such that it will be necessary to consider whether the suspect may have exerted some influence on the victim.’

Mrs Saunders said that assisted suicide is ‘an emotive subject on which many hold strong views and these cases present difficult and complex decisions for prosecutors.’ She added that ‘nothing in these guidelines offers immunity against prosecution.’

But the Care Not Killing campaign said: ‘This is very concerning.

‘It weakens the protections for sick and vulnerable people and signals to anyone in Europe wanting physician assisted suicide that Britain is open for business, opening the door to a Dignitas style death clinic being set up in the UK. It is an invitation to doctors who wish to push the boundaries and assist people who are not their patients to kill themselves to have free rein and go ahead.’

Campaign Director Dr Peter Saunders added: ‘Such a facility could now be staffed by so-called health care professionals, who could assist in terminating the lives of disabled, terminally ill and vulnerable people with impunity.

‘The DPP’s job is to administer the law not usurp the democratic authority of Parliament, which is due to discuss this issue in just a couple of weeks time. She is acting way beyond her brief and effectively decriminalising physician assisted suicide by stealth.’

‘I hope she will be forced to go in front of Parliament and answer why she has rewritten the current law, ignored the will of MPs and peers and put at risk the lives of many vulnerable people in our country.’

The assisted dying pressure group Dignity in Dying, which backs Lord Falconer’s bill, said the DPP’s guideline was a ‘small change’ which would not make the law workable.

Dignity in Dying chief Sarah Wootton said: ‘The change to the prosecuting policy makes clear that a healthcare professional who assists a patient to end their life in the context of an ongoing caring relationship is more likely to be prosecuted than a healthcare professional who assists outside of that context.

‘This seems to send a strange message to patients – effectively that they should not seek help from healthcare professionals who know them and their medical history, and who they as patients trust, but instead seek advice and assistance from healthcare professionals they do not know.’
