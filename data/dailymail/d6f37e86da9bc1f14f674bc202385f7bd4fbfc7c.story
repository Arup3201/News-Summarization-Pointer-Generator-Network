Swooping low over the water and the trees, it is almost possible to imagine how it might have felt to have been on-board the old warhorse as it made the Derwent Valley flypast to mark the Dambusters' 70th anniversary.

Images have now emerged of yesterday's flypast, captured by cameras on-board Britain's last Lancaster Bomber as it weaves its careful path along the contours of the valley.

The shots come from a number of positions on the plane, including an aerial gunner's eye view, along with a shot from directly underneath the aircraft.

Thousands of people, some of whom had trekked for miles over Peak District moorland, gathered on the shores of Derbyshire’s Derwent Reservoir yesterday to watch the Lancaster make three runs over the Derwent Dam.

It was here in 1943 that Wing Commander Guy Gibson trained his squadron for their historic nocturnal assaults on the Mohne, Eder and Sorpe dams, all crucial to Hitler’s industrial heartland in the Ruhr Valley.

Seventy-years-ago yesterday, the squadron, made up of the RAF's finest, took to the skies on their top-secret mission. Their aim was to destroy three dams in the Ruhr valley which were a vital source of industrial power for Nazi Germany.

Using ingenious bouncing bombs, their daring night-time raid saw two of the three dams breached and the mission was hailed a success.

Those 133 crewmen, led by Wing 
Commander Guy Gibson of 617 squadron, would become known as the 
Dambusters - a term still applied to the unit.

The
force had to fly across occupied Europe at night, so low that some were
killed by power lines, and drop the untried bombs in full view of the 
enemy’s guns.

The Mohne and Eder dams collapsed, German industry was thrown into chaos and the Allies enjoyed a huge boost to morale. But it was not without its cost: eight of Gibson’s 19 planes and 53 of his 133 men were lost.

In yesterday's flyover the Lancaster was preceded by a Spitfire and followed by a pair of Tornados from today's 617 Squadron.

Former Leading Aircraftsman Cyril Gosling, 90, from Oldham, was the unofficial guest of honour at the dam yesterday.

Following the flyover the said: 'I can't explain how that felt.

'I do feel so proud, though I shouldn't of course,' as he insisted he had 'only' been part of 617's ground crew.
