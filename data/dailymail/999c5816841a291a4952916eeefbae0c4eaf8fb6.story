There was something unwholesome about the way Cesc Fabregas’ romance with Barcelona ended. Perhaps breaking such a bond required a greater explanation, hence the story on the club’s website last summer that was really quite damning and unique in its detail.

The post read: ‘Despite glowing starts to each campaign, Cesc’s contributions to the cause gradually decreased as each season drew to a close.

‘From being someone who joined in with the attack, supplying and scoring goals, the magic tended to fade later on in each season. He only scored one, six and one goals in the last 24 games of each season.

‘For some reason, he was never as good in the second half of a season as in the first.’

To apply some context, such statements usually run to a confirmation that a player has left. If a club is feeling particularly venomous, it might omit the part where a player is thanked for his contribution.

Maybe the close relationship with Fabregas, the prodigal son who returned and then left for again, meant they felt compelled to explain the step of letting him join Chelsea for £30million.

The talented playmaker had a blistering start to the season and has racked up 15 assists despite his slump

But whatever the motive, there was a deep and intriguing point in the message. Barcelona had spotted a real trend and the rational among Chelsea’s fans are probably starting to see it.

That’s not to overreact and criticise a player who has arguably had the greatest impact on Chelsea’s title push. Fabregas has been magnificent, a deep-lying playmaker (usually) who has the engine to roam, the sense to dictate tempo and the guile to create.

His number of assists is astonishing – 15 in the Premier League, which is seven more than his next domestic rival. Alongside Nemanja Matic, Chelsea have a legitimately world-class midfield platform.

But on Wednesday night Fabregas looked flat. A subjective view, certainly, but the numbers are showing the return of a curious pattern.

He has neither scored nor assisted in his past nine games in all competitions, seven of which were starts. His last assist was against Swansea on January 17. His previous longest run without a goal or assist this season was two.

That is not to say he is playing badly in this spell. Far from it. He was poor when he came on against Bradford in the FA Cup and was off the pace in the league game against Burnley, but generally has been among Chelsea’s best performers.

And yet the incision is not what it was. Looking at league figures alone, he managed 15 goals or assists in the first half of the season and has so far scored or created only two in the second half. It is a trend that goes back all the way to the 2009-10 season, Fabregas’s penultimate campaign at Arsenal, when his respective figures were 19 and nine.

In 2010-11 they were nine and five and in 2011-12, his first back at Barcelona, he scored or created 13 in the first half of the season and four on the stretch.

Last season, it was even more pronounced – 16 going out and five coming back in.

It is a mystery, not least because it would be unfair to conclude he is in poor form. But he is less incisive, regardless of whether it is for individual or team reasons. Certainly, his role within the side has tended to change at times recently, with Jose Mourinho occasionally switching between 4-2-3-1 and 4-3-3. 

And there has also been a more restrained manner in how the team is playing, perhaps because there is a greater emphasis on protecting what they have in the league rather chasing a bigger advantage.

In any case, the numbers make interesting reading for the player. He certainly won’t thank Barcelona for flagging it up.
