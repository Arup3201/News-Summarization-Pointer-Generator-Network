A former Oakland Raiders cheerleader has launched her own class-action lawsuit against the NFL team in a bid to win back pay for the grueling hours and conditions she claims she was forced to endure.

Susie Sanchez, who filed her lawsuit in Alameda County Superior Court on Monday, was part of a group of 90 cheerleaders who brought a combined lawsuit against the Raiders a year ago.

She is now the third former Raiderette to publicly reject the team’s ‘meager’ proposed settlement of $1.25 million announced in September.

As well as claiming that she was denied basic minimum-wage and overtime compensation, her action also states that cheerleaders were denied promised media opportunities, reports SFGate.

Sanchez was 37 years old when she finally realized her dream to become a Raiderette in 2011.

As a mother of three and grandmother she was the oldest cheerleader on the team.

Her attorney, Drexel Bradshaw, said his client was promised ‘opportunities for exposure’ in the media but the team ‘denied those opportunities when it didn’t suit the Raiders or the NFL.

‘She was approached by numerous media and entertainment outlets about her life story and then franchise employees blocked access to her suit themselves.’

The cheerleaders were paid $125 per home game, or $1,250 per season, in a contract that also included hours of unpaid rehearsals, charity and commercial appearances.

The women say their pay translated to less than $5 an hour. California's minimum wage is $9 an hour.

Sanchez has also accused the team of ‘deplorable’ working conditions. Her lawsuit states that cheerleaders were regularly forced to attend ‘grueling’ training sessions at the beginning of each season that they weren’t paid for.

The suit also says cheerleaders were forced to 'ignore lingering and painful injuries during rehearsals and games for fear of being "benched" or fined.'

The Raider's proposed $1.25 million settlement covers 90 women who worked as cheerleaders during any of the four NFL seasons from 2010 through 2013. 

The cheerleaders would get about $6,000 for each year they worked between 2010 and 2012, and $2,500 for 2013, when the Raiders increased their pay.

The proposed settlement would also cover all unpaid expenses and minimum wages, plus interest.
