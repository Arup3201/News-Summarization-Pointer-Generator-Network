Five fractures: Retired teacher Jean Duggleby suffered several broken bones before she was diagnosed with osteoporosis

Jean Duggleby was lifting her bicycle into the boot of her car when she felt her back crack. 'I've always been fit so it never occurred to me that I'd broken a bone, I thought I'd pulled a muscle,' says the retired teacher from North-East London. She was 61 at the time.

'I was disappointed to have to postpone my bike ride - and couldn't believe I was still in agony days later.'

But it wasn't a pulled muscle - Jean had fractured a vertebra in her spine. She was suffering from osteoporosis, characterised by 'fragility' fractures in the bone.

These fractures occur most commonly in the wrist, spine or hip, and are often unexpected, coming after a minor bump or a fall from standing height.

But, unfortunately Jean didn't learn this until it was too late.

Instead, a week afterwards, Jean went to her GP and asked for an investigation. 'He said there was no need and didn't do even a cursory examination,' she says. He sent her home and told her to take painkillers and touch her toes every morning.

Incredibly, it took eight years - and four more spinal fractures - before she was finally referred for a DXA (dual energy  X-ray absorptiometry) scan to check her bone density. The fifth fracture happened when she missed her footing stepping off a boat and fell on her backside.

'One of the other fractures was after picking up shopping, another just pushing a trolley along,' says Jean. 'Each time I suffered weeks of pain. And each time I went to the doctor but was told there was no problem and it would get better on its own.

'During that period my younger sister had been diagnosed with severe osteoporosis, but even though I explained all this to the doctor, he insisted that there was nothing seriously wrong with me.

'I was in such pain with the final fracture that I kept going back to the surgery and on the third visit, I saw a new doctor who referred me to hospital,' she recalls.

'The DXA scan was sufficiently worrying for me to be sent for an MRI scan a few days later and the resulting image clearly showed the five spinal fractures I'd suffered. It brought back some unpleasant memories, I can tell you.'

Her experience is horribly common. Around 2.3 million people in the UK, mainly women over 50, have osteoporosis. The cause can be genetic, hormonal or result from lifestyle factors such as smoking, drinking or having a low body mass index (BMI) - being too light means the bones aren't stressed enough to produce new bone cells.

Porous: What happens to the bone when affected by osteoporosis

Medications such as steroids, and digestive disorders such as coeliac disease (which affect the absorption of nutrients) can cause osteoporosis in younger people.

And while broken wrists and backs mend relatively easily, the true hazard of osteoporosis is the huge increased risk of hip fracture - every year in Britain it leads to 89,000 broken hips, which can often prove fatal.

'Hip fracture is associated with a threefold increase in the risk of premature death - with one in four people dying within a year of breaking their hip and thousands more becoming dependent on carers and services,' says Dr Jonathan Treml, associate director for falls and bone health at the Royal College of Physicians.

'That's why anyone over 50 who suffers a fragility fracture should be tested for osteoporosis and given correct treatment.'

Yet many doctors still regard increased risk of fracture as a normal part of ageing, like wrinkles or grey hair. A report from the National Osteoporosis Society revealed sufferers endure three fractures on average before diagnosis - with one in five having another fracture within a year of their first.

Experts agree that the key to tackling this is Fracture Liaison Services, linked to a hospital's A&E department - or in a fracture clinic or community clinic staffed by GPs.

'These patients might as well have signs 
on their foreheads saying: “I've got osteoporosis. Do something!” Yet 
they are sent home with reassuring noises.'

Where these services are in place, hip fracture rates are being reduced by around 3 per cent a year (bucking the trend throughout most of Britain, where hip fractures are increasing by around 1.5 per cent year on year).

In 2009, the Department of Health called for a fracture liaison service to be available for 'every local population'. Yet worrying evidence from the Royal College of Physicians shows that four years later, only one in three local health authorities has a designated fracture liaison service.

Further, GPs as well as hospital doctors are still 'failing to instigate conversations about bone health with those at risk,' says the National Osteoporosis Society. 'It's staggering that one in two hip fractures are preceded by at least one previous fracture,' says Graham Davenport, GP and clinical champion for osteoporosis at the Royal College of General Practitioners.

There should be widespread alarm that so many patients presenting with a fragility fracture are sent home without a DXA scan, adds Dr Alun Cooper, a Crawley GP who helped write the national guidelines on osteoporosis.

'These patients might as well have signs on their foreheads saying: “I've got osteoporosis. Do something!” Yet they are sent home with reassuring noises.'

The failure is almost always organisational, says Dr Treml. 'If there's no system in place for good communication between hospital and general practice to identify who takes responsibility for following up fragility fractures, you can't expect individual doctors to initiate this essential assessment.'

Perhaps equally significant is the problem of getting the right treatment for patients - and ensuring people with the disease understand the importance of taking the medication.

Debilitating effect: A new report reveals that sufferers of the condition endure three fractures on average before their osteoporosis is diagnosed

The mid-Nineties saw the launch of the first highly-effective drugs, known as bisphosphonates, which have been shown to halve the risk of a further fracture.

Yet as with many long-term diseases where there are no 'scary' symptoms to jolt patients into taking a daily pill, many don't take their osteoporosis medication. Motivation is even more of a problem with bisphosphonates, as it can take up to two years before bone density is seen to improve.

By then, four out of five patients have stopped taking their medication - within the first year, according to some studies.

A further complication is evidence that bisphosphonates can - in rare circumstances - cause a slight increase in an unusual type of hip fracture after five to ten years of continuous use.

'We now know that some patients need a “drug holiday” of one to two years after taking medication for around five years,' says Professor Cyrus Cooper, chair of the International Osteoporosis Foundation Scientific Committee.

Fracture liaison services can help by providing specialists to motivate patients to stick with long-term drug therapy and make lifestyle changes such as taking up weight-bearing exercise - as well as monitoring bone density in case a drug holiday is needed.

Jean Duggleby's story shows the value of such a regimen. Since her diagnosis in 2011, she's been taking bisphosophonates along with vitamin D and calcium, and doing regular Pilates. Her bone density increased by 12 per cent in just one year, although her bones are still weaker than they should be.

The National Osteoporosis Society is now appealing to patients to take responsibility for their own care by insisting on getting fragility fractures adequately treated and asking their doctor about a bone check.

'When people are aware they have the condition, more steps can be taken to reduce unnecessary fractures,' says the society's director Claire Severgnini.

Jean wishes such advice had been available ten years ago. 'I used to be able to walk 14 miles a day. But I've been in constant pain since the last fracture, despite two operations. Now I struggle to walk four miles. In any case I have to be careful all the time and I have to leave the heavy lifting to my partner.

'I watch my best friend, who is the same age as me, out climbing mountains in Snowdonia. We used to match each other and it's changed my life knowing I can no longer join her. It means my social life has narrowed and it's not fair.'
