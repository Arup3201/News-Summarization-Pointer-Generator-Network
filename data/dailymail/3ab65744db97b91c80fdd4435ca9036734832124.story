A driver has come forward saying the deputy who shot dead a 13-year-old California boy after mistaking his fake AK-47 as real pulled a gun on him also, after he failed to signal a lane change during a carpool.

Jeff Westbrook, 57, of Santa Rosa said he was mistreated by Deputy Erick Gelhaus after being pulled over Aug. 21 in Cotati, so much so that at one point he asked Gelhaus: 'Sir, is there something wrong with you?'

'I felt like I was watching somebody I needed to help,' Mr Westbrook, 
a program manager at an information technology company, told CBS of Gelhaus.

'This was 
not right. He did not manage this correctly.'

Gelhaus shot Andy Lopez seven times at a Santa Rosa parking after recieving reports of a suspicious and believing his toy machine gun was real.

Mr Westbrook was pulled over by Gelhaus for not using his indicator.

He said he pulled into a shoulder, but offered to move the car forward because there was not much room next to the driver door for Gelhaus.

When the car started moving, Gelhaus is alleged to have drawn his gun.

'It was about a foot from by face,' Westbrook said.

'I've never had a gun pointed at me before.'

Tragic: Andy Lopez (right) was shot dead by Sheriff's deputy Erick Gelhaus (left) after he mistook the teenagers replica AK-47 for a real weapon

Jess Westbrook claims to have had a gun pulled on him by deputy sheriff Eric Gelhaus two months before the tragic death of Andy Lopez. Mr Westbrook says he thought that Gelhaus was 'emotional unstable' and is now 'struggling' with not taking his complaint further

Having recognized Gelhaus in the widespread coverage of Lopez's death, Mr Westbrook is now 'struggling' with the fact he didn't press harder with his complaint.

'I'm wondering, if I had fought this a little more aggressively - 
actually waved around like a chimpanzee with my arms in the air to the 
district attorney's office and come down there physically - that maybe 
something could have changed,' he said.

'I don't know.'

The new claim comes after investigators recently revealed how quickly Gelhaus opened fire on Lopez.

Investigators confirmed that a second officer, a trainee, stayed at the wheel of the police car while Gelhaus approached the boy.

According to the Press Democrat, Santa Rosa police Lieutenant Paul Henry said that within seconds Gelhaus ordered the teenager to drop the weapon before his partner could take cover behind the open door of the vehicle.

The account seems to back up eyewitness claims and dispatch records that claim that only ten seconds elapsed between Gelhaus confronting Lopez and shooting him.

Andy Lopez was killed by police earlier this month

The latest development comes as protestors continue to call for Gelhaus to face charges over the shooting.

Lieutenant Henry told the Press Democrat: 'Deputy Gelhaus was able to engage more quickly because he didn't have to drive the vehicle.

'By the time (Gelhaus's partner) had exited his door and taken cover, at that point Deputy Gelhaus had already engaged the subject, with the commands and with the weapon.

'The threat was essentially over.'

Police also revealed that Lopez was wearing a hooded sweatshirt but had the hood down and was not wearing headphones that might have affected his hearing.

The patrol car Gelhaus and his partner were using was not equipped with either audio or video recording equipment.

Yesterday hundreds of demonstrators marched to protest the fatal shooting which has sparked community outrage and an FBI investigation.

A funeral has been held for the 13-year-old boy who was shot dead by police last week in California while carrying a toy rifle. Sujey Lopez clutches the coffin holding the body of her 13-year-old son Andy

Officers monitored from rooftops and 
others wearing helmets stood guard at barricades while protesters 
rallied outside the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office in Santa Rosa.

The protesters, including middle- and high-school-age students and members of the Occupy Oakland movement, assembled in downtown Santa Rosa before marching through streets with signs and hooded sweatshirts bearing photos of the boy.

'Andy Lopez did not have to die,' they chanted during the nearly three-hour, peaceful demonstration.

No arrests were made.

The demonstration came on the same day mourners bid farewell to Lopez at his funeral.

Lopez
 was shot and killed October 22 by Gelhaus, a firearms instructor who 
authorities said mistook a pellet gun carried by Lopez for an assault 
rifle.

Investigators say the hoodie-wearing 
teen didn't comply with commands to drop the gun and was turning toward 
deputies while raising the barrel when he was shot multiple times.

The shooting has generated several protests in Santa Rosa, located about 50 miles northwest of San Francisco

The
 shooting has generated several protests in Santa Rosa, located about 50
 miles northwest of San Francisco. On Sunday, more than 1,000 people 
turned out for a service to remember Lopez.

Sonoma
 County Assistant Sheriff Lorenzo Duenas said Gelhaus, 48, has been a 
Sonoma County firearms instructor and rangemaster for 19 years and has 
trained his law enforcement colleagues in the use of force.

He is one of 26 such instructors for the county.

Gelhaus
 also teaches pistol, carbine, shotgun and rifle lessons for Gunsite, a 
private company in Arizona, according to the company's website.

The deputy, who has received death threats after the incident that sparked outrage in the California community, has broad experience with guns and regularly contributed to law enforcement magazines and online forums, warning his comrades that they may be required to use lethal force to stay safe.

According to his online profiles, Gelhaus served as an infantry squad leader in Iraq and is an avid hunter in North America as well as Africa.

However, officials told Sfgate.com the deputy has not fired at a suspect in 24 years with the department, where he serves as a field training officer for new recruits and trains colleagues to shoot at the department's gun range.

But in a 2008 article for monthly policing and gun rights magazine, S.W.A.T., he gave other officers advice on what to do if the possibility arises.

'Today is the day you may need to kill someone in order to go home,' he wrote. 'If you cannot turn on the 'mean gene' for yourself, who will? If you find yourself in an ambush, in the kill zone, you need to turn on that mean gene.'

He went on: 'Taking some kind of action - any kind of action - is critical. If you shut down (physically, psychologically, or both) and stay in the kill zone, bad things will happen to you. You must take some kind of action.'

Sonoma County Assistant Sheriff 
Lorenzo Duenas described his colleague as a 'respected and solid 
employee' who recieved the sheriff's medal of valor in 2004 for rescuing
 people from a burning car.

The
 deputy, who served in Iraq in 2005, is on paid leave pending the 
investigation and his attorney declined to comment to the newspaper 
website.

The man's identity was revealed just 
hours after two witnesses claimed he only shouted at Lopez one time to 
drop his weapon before firing.

Police say that Gelhaus fear that his life and that of his partner were in danger when he opened fire.

During a news conference on Wednesday authorities displayed a real assault weapon and the pellet gun - which 
resembled an AK-47 with a black magazine and brown butt - to demonstrate
 how difficult it is to tell them apart.

Federal law requires replica guns to have an orange tip, but Lopez's toy rifle didn't have one.

Police
 also revealed that Lopez had his back to the deputies, so they didn't 
realize he was so young.

They
 claim Lopez was about 20 to 30 feet from them when he turned with the 
barrel of the gun pointing toward them and they opened fire because they
 feared for their lives.
