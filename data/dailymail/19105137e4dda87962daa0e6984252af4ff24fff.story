Clark Griswold's Cousin Eddie would not be pleased. 

A rusty RV that played a memorable role in the holiday classic National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation  has been vandalized at an Ohio museum.

The owner of the Castle Noel museum in Medina, just south of Cleveland, reports that Cousin Eddie's dilapidated camper from the 1989 film starring Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid was damaged sometime last week.

Christmas all year round: The RV was purchased by Mark and Dana Klaus for their Castle Noel Christmas museum in Medina, Ohio 

A ladder was taken off the back of the famous movie prop, a tail light was smashed, an antenna was broken and a side panel was removed, according to a police report.

The RV brought Cousin Eddie, played by Quaid, and family to the Griswold house for Christmas in the beloved comedy. 

The quirky Castle Noel museum, described on its website as 'America's largest indoor year-round Christmas entertainment attraction,' features other props and costumes from Christmas films.

The owners of the museum, Mark and Dana Klaus, contacted police about the act of vandalism just before 9.30am Thursday, according to the Northeast Ohio Media Group.

The incident is still being investigated by the Medina Police Department.

The Klauses have surveillance cameras installed on the property, and they are hoping the footage they had handed over to the police will help investigators track down the perpetrators.

The boxy blue-and-white RV, covered in splotches of rust, was purchased by Mark Klaus and his wife from a Los Angeles movie prop shop a year before the Christmas museum opened its doors in November 2013.

The exhibit space features costumes and accessories from nearly every Christmas classic, including Will Farrell's green coat from the 2003 film Elf and a life-size model of Jim Carrey's The Grinch.
