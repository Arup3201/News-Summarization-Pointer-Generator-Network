A street performer with no legs or driver's licence has been caught by police driving a van across a Chinese highway.

Remarkably, police caught Chen Shikuan driving the modified vehicle after seeing a sign stating it was a 'vehicle for disabled people'.

Upon closer inspection, they discovered the double amputee had modified the pedals so they could be hand-controlled and he could drive without having to use his legs.

Police gave him a warning but let him go after telling him not to drive on the highway again

Shikuan was stopped at a toll gate in central China's Hubei Province after suspicious police officers noted the disability message inscribed on the number plates.

When questioned, Mr Shikuan explained he was once a lorry driver but lost his legs in an accident two years ago.

Deciding he did not want to become a beggar, he made a living as a street artist and travelled the country singing on the streets with his wife.

Officers gave him a warning but let him go after telling him not to drive on the highway again.

In 2008, a Chinese driver made headlines when he was handed a public safety summons after being caught driving without arms.

Zing Shen was steering the vehicle with his feet and claimed he had been driving like that for years after losing his limbs in an industrial accident.

At the time, a police spokesman said: 'The man said that he was a very safe driver and felt he was as good as anyone else on the road, despite his disability.

'He had an automatic so did not need to worry about changing gears and said he had put a lot of practice into learning to control the steering wheel with his legs.'
