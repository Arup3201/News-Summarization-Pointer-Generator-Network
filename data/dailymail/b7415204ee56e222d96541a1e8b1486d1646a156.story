The iconic Chelsea Hotel in New York City was once notorious as a refuge for the eccentric, the eclectic, and the creative.

During the second half of the 20th century it was a hive of creativity that attracted a host of famous and emerging names from the worlds of music, film, literature, art and fashion.

Although the hotel closed for major renovations in 2011, it has been immortalized in countless art forms by many of the artists who made it their home at one stage or another.

Before it closed, photographer Victoria Cohen was allowed access to attempt to capture the lost Bohemia. Her photographs have just been published in a book called Hotel Chelsea.

Located at 222 West 23rd Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, in the Manhattan neighborhood of Chelsea, the 250-unit hotel has been home to some of the great and unconventional writers, musicians, artists, and actors including Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin, Charles Bukowski, Allen Ginsberg, Leonard Cohen, Patti Smith, Germaine Greer and Quentin Crisp to name but a few.

It is famously where Jack Kerouac wrote ‘On The Road’, where Arthur C. Clarke wrote ‘2001: A Space Odyssey,’ where Andy Warhol directed his film ‘Chelsea Girls’, and where poets Allen Ginsberg, and Gregory Corso used to carry out philosophical and artistical exchanges.

It is also known as the place where the writer Dylan Thomas was staying when he died of pneumonia on November 9, 1953, and where Nancy Spungen, girlfriend of Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols, was found stabbed to death on October 12, 1978. 

The hotel is perhaps most famously immortalized in song by Leonard Cohan who wrote 'Chelsea Hotel 2' about a sexual encounter their with the singer Janis Joplin

The building has been a designated New York City landmark since 1966, and on the National Register of Historic Places since 1977

It was perhaps most famously immortalized in song by Leonard Cohan who wrote 'Chelsea Hotel 2' about a sexual encounter their with the singer Janis Joplin.

Madonna even lived in the building during the early 19080s and returned in the early 1990s to take photographs for her infamous 'Sex' book.

Towards the end of the 20th century it fell out of favor and into disrepair and for many years lived in on its reputation, before the doors closed in 2011 for a gut renovation.

After the hotel was sold, New York-based photographer Victoria Cohen was invited to capture and document the essence of the building’s original interior before its sad demise.

Cohen’s photographs of the hallways, lobbies, and rooms, once beaming with life and vision, but by 2011 bare and aged, help to illuminate a bohemian era that once was, speaking untold truths of a lost time.

Fascinating and bittersweet, Hotel 
Chelsea casts the historic landmark through the lens of the twenty-first
century, exhibiting it as it has never been seen before, and will never
be seen again.

Built between 1883 and 1885, the twelve-story red-brick building was one of New York's first private apartment cooperatives.

Among its distinctive features were the delicate, flower-ornamented iron balconies on its facade, and its grand staircase, which extended twelve floors up.

The building was a designated New York City landmark since 1966, and joined the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

As of August 1, 2011 the hotel stopped taking reservations for guests in order to begin renovations, but long-time residents remain, some of them protected by state rent regulations.

The renovations prompted complaints by the remaining tenants of health hazards caused by the construction. These were investigated by the city's Building Department, which found no major violations.

In November 2011, the management ordered all of the hotel's many artworks taken off the walls, supposedly for their protection and cataloging, a move which some tenants interpreted as a step towards forcing them out as well.

An exhibit of Victoria Cohen's photographs of the Chelsea Hotel is taking place at Third Streaming, 10 Greene Street, Soho, New York between Sept 17 and Oct 25 2013.
