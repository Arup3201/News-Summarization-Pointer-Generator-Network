One fashion fan has taken her admiration of female icons to the next level by sculpting them out of lipsticks.

Hong Kong artist May Sum uses tiny tools to create 3D portraiture of fashion's most influential figures and sells them on her 'wahahafactory' Etsy shop for £280 to £420 each.

She uses colour ranging from purple to crimson, pink, nude, brown and orange to create her tiny masterpieces.

May Sum's lipstick art work features famous people like Lady Gaga, seen here in various looks

May
prides herself as a multi-media artist and Asia's first lipstick sculptor.

Her lippies
 come in various widths, hues and containers, and she plays with these 
features to create remarkable sculptures of scenery, animals, and most 
notably, the series of famous women titled Woman Power.

She recently held her first Asia Lipstick Sculpture Exhibition, themed Fashion Icon.

Sculptures of women in fashion power featured, including Madonna, Lady Gaga, Coco Chanel, Diana, Princess of Wales, Twiggy, Kate
 Moss, Vivienne Westwood, Susie Bubble, Anna Wintour, Iris Apfel, 
Victoria Beckham, and more.

Her depictions are both quite realistic and echo a total uniqueness because of the material form which they are carved - an ultra simple and effective fashion statement, adding a pop of colour to your lips, totally appropriate for fashionista carvings - and the hue chosen for each individual.

The fine detail signifies tiny and precise tools are used during the carving process. Although
 the sculptures aren’t exact replicas of the characters 
depicted, the Chinese artist nails the details that 
define her muses.

Lady Gaga is instantly recognisable by her round glasses and hair bow, while Coco Chanel sports her signature
 hat and pearls. She even captures Twiggy's individual eyelashes and Anna Wintour's iconic bob.

Some women would kill for a
lipstick from an established brand but May doesn’t think twice before butchering them 
into popular fashion icons.

She works with the following brands only: NARS, MAC, Estée Lauder, YSL and Max Factor.

Her lipstick sculptures are famous in
 Asia and are now making waves in the UK and America. She carves tailor 
made sculptures, too, for those hoping to have their face immortalised in expensive lipstick. She also sculpts clothing and pets.

Custom
 designs are achieved by sending May a high resolution front and side 
view picture of the object to be sculpted before placing your order. The artwork will then take two weeks to make.

Too thin and too detailed subjects are 'impossible to sculpt', according to her Etsy page.

She
 advises customers do not expect perfection from a handmade artwork. 
Fragile lipstick sculptures must be kept somewhere dry, with good 
ventilation, within the temperature of 17-25℃. This will not make 
the lipstick deform or melt. If you put it in the fridge it may split or
 crack.

May says keep the lipstick around 17-25¿. Do not put it into the refrigerator as it will crack

May's art is sculpted in about 10-12 hours. For more complicated ones, it could take a week or longer

May held her first exhibition in Hong Kong in August. She prides herself as the first lipstick sculptor

May's work features scenes on bronzer sticks and landscapes as well as famous people on lippies

It echoes Greek mythology, Renaissance art and Eighties wall carvings
