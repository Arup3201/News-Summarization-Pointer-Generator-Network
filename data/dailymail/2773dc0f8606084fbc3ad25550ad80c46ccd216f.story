A teen from a Chicago suburb is being hailed as a hero these days after he saved the life of another child who fell through the ice on covering a retention pond earlier this week.

Zac Thomas, 14, was walking near the pond when he saw a younger boy in the water and in distress.

Footprints seen in the snow covering the ice show the exact route the 9-year-old took near the bank of the pond. His footprints, however, come to an abrupt end in the spot where he fell through.

Hero: Zac Thomas says he credits the Boy Scouts for teaching him what to do if someone falls through the ice

Luckily, Thomas - a long-time Boy Scout - happened to be walking by.

'The first thing that went through my mind was to get him out, Thomas told CBS Chicago.

That's when his Boy Scout training kicked in.

'I ran down there, and I stood on the grass and I reached out and I grabbed his hand and I pulled him out,' Zac says.

Frigid: The 9-year-old fell through the ice at this pond and had almost his entire body submerged in icy water

After getting the boy out of the water, he walked him back to his house, where his sisters were waiting for him.

When asked if he was worried that he, too, might get pulled into the icy water by helping the younger boy, Zac says 'yes and no because if I went in, I know how to get out because Boy Scouts taught me.'

After saving the boy and delivering him to his family, Zac returned home to his proud parents.

Proud: Zac's mom, Angela Prusinski, says she's proud of the man her son is turning out to be

'Heâ€™s a just a great kid. Heâ€™s growing up fast and making good decisions on a daily basis,' mother Angela Prusinski says.

The boy who fell through the ice is reportedly doing OK - and his mother is incredibly grateful Zac saved her young son.
