A domestic violence charity has launched the world's first audience-editing commercial, allowing the audience to view different events with each eye.

The groundbreaking Women's Aid cinema advert uses 3D stereoscopic technology to show two separate scenarios simultaneously.

In one, a woman prepares a meal. And in the other, the same woman prepares the same meal, but a violent partner is added to the situation.

Will you turn a blind eye? The new advert for the Women's Aid domestic violence campaign allows the viewer to choose which scenario they watch

As the technology allows the viewer to control what they are seeing by opening and closing one eye, they can choose to shut out the abusive scenario, or to open their eyes to domestic violence.

With the haunting soundtrack of Massive Attack's 'Angel', the commercial, created by leading London advertising agency WCRS, simply asks 'Will you turn a blind eye?'.

Domestic abuse: In one of the scenarios, a woman tries to cook while her abusive husband shouts at her

Marai Larasi, Co-Chair of Women's Aid, said: 'Women's Aid is delighted to have been part of the world's first audience-edited commercial and would like to thank WCRS for creating this groundbreaking advert with us.

'At Women's Aid we know that one in four women experience domestic violence at some point in their lifetime, but many of us can't imagine it happening to someone we know. Yet it is happening all the time around us, without us necessarily noticing.

'The technology used to make this advert allows the viewer to choose whether they see the abuse that is happening behind closed doors in a relationship.

'The audience will have the ability to shut out the abuse and pretend it's not happening, or they can choose to view the reality of living with domestic violence.

'We hope it will open the audience's eyes to the prevalence of domestic violence and let them know that Women's Aid is here to help, as well as encouraging viewers to text to donate to support the lifesaving work of Women's Aid.'

Ross Neil, Creative Director at WCRS said: '3D is all about what your eyes see and what your brain creates, and plays on the fact that each of our eyes sees the same thing but from slightly different perspectives.'

'This got us thinkingâ€¦what if you could create two stories, one for each eye, and leave it to the viewer to edit for themselves. What you get is technology that implicates the viewer in how much they choose to see or notice and a powerful advertising format that enables us to deliver a poignant message.'

Are you turning a blind eye? In one scenario the woman cooks peacefully alone

Director Chris Vincze from MPC Creative, who created the technology used in the ad, said: 'We were really excited about developing the technology to enable a completely new viewing experience and simultaneously bringing the script to life.

'It's the combination of audience involvement and powerful performances from the two actors that really helps convey the message.'

The ad will run in selected cinemas across the UK to coincide with the nationwide launch of The Hobbit in 3D.

One in four: A quarter of all women experience domestic violence at some point in their lifetime, but many of us can't imagine it happening to someone we know
