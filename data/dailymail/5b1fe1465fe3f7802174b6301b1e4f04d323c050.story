The woman who accused New York police commissioner Ray Kelly’s son of raping her last October said she got pregnant from the attack and subsequently aborted the baby, police sources say.

Greg Kelly, 43, was absent Thursday morning from his job as anchor of 
the popular local morning show 'Good Day New York' and through a lawyer 
denied the allegations.

Lew Leone, the general manager of the local Fox station, has meanwhile confirmed Kelly 'has requested some time off' while the investigation is underway. He did not elaborate.

The son of New York City's police commissioner has been accused of 
sexually assaulting a woman who told authorities she got pregnant from 
the encounter and had an abortion, people familiar with the 
investigation said on Thursday.

The Manhattan district attorney is 
investigating the serious allegations, as an NYPD probe could be seen as
a conflict of interest.

The alleged sexual assault took place in October, but the woman involved did not report her accusation until Tuesday.

Kelly, a former Fox News correspondent, is cooperating with the investigation, his lawyer, Andrew Lankler, said in an emailed statement.

Greg Kelly 'strenuously denies any wrongdoing of any kind,' Lankler 
said. 'We know that the district attorney's investigation will prove Mr.
Kelly's innocence.' The lawyer didn't respond to questions about the 
focus of the investigation.

A friend of the alleged victim’s 
boyfriend told ABC News that the woman had been ‘an emotional cripple’ 
since the alleged incident.

The
friend said her boyfriend was outraged over the alleged attack. ‘He 
went and picked her up from the office where she was distraught, and he 
said later that the rape had taken place there,’ the friend told ABC 
News.

The woman, who is around 30, told police that she and Mr Kelly met on the street and went for drinks at the South Street Seaport on the evening of October 8, according to the New York Times.

They went to her office at a law firm in downtown Manhattan, where the assault allegedly happened.

She says that when her boyfriend found out about the encounter, he confronted the older Mr Kelly at a public event, saying: 'Your son ruined my girlfriend's life,' according to NYPD spokesman Paul Browne.

The commissioner told him to write a letter detailing the allegations, as he reportedly didn’t want to discuss it in public.

His lawyer added: 'We know that the District Attorney's investigation will prove Mr. Kelly's innocence.’

Mr Kelly, 43, joined Fox News Channel in 2002 and was the White House correspondent from 2005-2007.

A Marine Corps veteran and reservist, he also covered the Iraq War, including four assignments in Baghdad.

Before that, he covered politics for local cable news channel New York 1 and was an anchor and reporter for NewsChannel 34, an ABC and NBC affiliate in Binghamton, New York.

He also served for nearly a decade in the Marine Corps and is now a lieutenant colonel in its reserves.

Raymond Kelly, 70, returned to the police commissioner's post in 2002 after a stint in the 1990s.
