Crushed: Gloria Sekwena, 47, died in a stampede yesterday as she tried to register her son for a place at the University of Johannesburg. She was a nurse who lived and worked in London

A mother who died in a stampede as she tried to register her son for a place at university in South Africa was a nurse who lived and worked in London, it emerged today.

Gloria Sekwena, 47, travelled back from Britain to South Africa late last month to help secure her son Kgositsile, 18, a position on a medicine course at the University of Johannesburg.

But she died yesterday after being crushed amid a frantic scrum caused when a crowd of around 5,000 people stampeded through the institution's gates.

Two other people were critically 
injured and at least 17 more needed medical attention following the 
chaotic scenes yesterday morning.

Today
University of Johannesburg spokesman Herman Esterhuisen confirmed 
university officials had since made contact with the dead woman's 
family.

He said: 'We can confirm that the woman who sadly died was Gloria Sekwena, who worked as a nurse and lived in London.

'It is our understanding that she returned to South Africa at the end of December to help her son get a place at university.

'It is obviously very sad indeed that she became caught up in what happened yesterday.'

Mr
Esterhuisen said University of Johannesburg leaders had arranged to 
meet Mrs Sekwena's family later this week and had offered to pay her 
teenage son's tuition fees if he decided to study at the institution.

He added: 'We are in contact with the family and we are offering all the support we can.

'As part of that we have offered to pay for the boy's tuition.'

It
was reported today that Mrs Sekwena lived in London with her husband 
Joseph, who remained in Britain and was informed of the tragedy 
yesterday.

Tragedy: The mother of one student hopeful was killed and at least 20 other people were seriously hurt

Frantic: Around 5,000 prospective students had lined up outside the institution in the desperate hope of securing the remaining places for the next academic year

The couple, from Krugersdorp west of Johannesburg, are believed to also have another school-age son.

South
Africa's Sowetan newspaper reported that Mr Sekwena was now making 
arrangements to return to Johannesburg to support his son.

The
publication quoted an unnamed family member, who told how Kgositsile 
became overwhelmed by grief after realising his mother had died.

The Sowetan reported: 'A sobbing Kgositsile was consoled at the university's centre for psychological services where he had to be tranquillised by a nurse and attended to by a psychologist.

'An emotional family member said they received a frantic call from a 'confused' Kgositsile, who screamed: "My mum is unconscious. I need help. Please come".

'We immediately switched on the TV and heard that someone had died. We didn't know what to think.

'I wasn't sure what was going on and the next minute he called again, crying, saying, "My mother is no more".'

The relative added that the teenager later explained the final frantic moments of his mother's life.

They said: 'He said people started pushing and shoving, and that chaos erupted when someone jumped the fence to get into the university.

'He said he fell to the side and his mother was still in the crowd, people were stepping on her and pushing her. She disappeared in the crowd.

'He was looking for his mother and when he found her she was unconscious already. He was crying. She died within minutes.

'He just said, "I don't have a mother anymore".'

The Sowetan reported that Mrs Sekwana sustained no significant visible injuries during the stampede but died from internal bleeding and shock.

Her son was taken to a Johannesburg mortuary yesterday to identify her body.

The South African government has ordered a full enquiry into the tragedy, which happened around 7.30am yesterday.

University officials told how around 5,000 people formed a deadly crush as they rushed to enter the campus.

Security chiefs opened a gate after realising people at the front of the crowd could be in danger, but several people were trampled amid the resulting stampede.

Johannesburg emergency services yesterday confirmed at least 20 people had been injured in the incident, including two who remained in serious conditions in hospital.

The institution's vice-chancellor, 
Ihron Rensburg, said the tragedy happened as hopeful students and their 
parents pushed to get through the university's main gates for the chance
to secure late registration for the new academic year, which starts 
later this month.

Addressing
a press conference yesterday, he said: 'When we opened the gates this 
morning, the rush to get in created an unbearable crush on those at the 
front.

'The outcome was that there was a lady who was the front who was crushed and she passed away.

'Two other people suffered very serious injuries and we fear for their lives.'

Speaking about Gloria
Sekwena's death, he said: 'The situation was particularly tragic as the
young man was inside the registration tent and had no idea that this 
had happened.

'We are offering counselling and support to those who have been affected by this.

Experts have said they believe the stampede reflected the desperation among many South Africans to access higher education.

The country's university system is believed by many to be under-resourced, with most institutions significantly over-subscribed for courses.

The lack of widespread internet 
access and poor careers advice in rural or township areas means 
thousands of prospective applicants are forced to turn up in person to 
register their interest in further studies.

Experts believe the problem is 
symptomatic of a higher education system which has failed to expand 
adequately to South Africans' growing demand for university places 
following the end of apartheid.

Before the advent of democracy in 1994, university places were limited largely to the white population and a tiny black elite.

However, students from all backgrounds
are now able to apply for further studies, with many choosing to do so 
in a country where poverty and unemployment remain common.

Some critics argue that standards at 
South African universities have fallen in recent years and suggest 
entrance criteria should be raised.

The University of Johannesburg describes itself as a 'comprehensive' institution which offers diplomas alongside degrees.

Last year, it received more than 85,000 applications for fewer than 12,000 places on its undergraduate courses.

The tragedy on its campus came as it offered an opportunity for high-achieving students who had not already registered to do so at the last minute.
