A teenager at one of the country's most prestigious private schools has outed himself as a virgin and is encouraging his classmates to employ the same restraint to avoid getting their hearts broken.

Phin Lyman, 18, a sixth former at Wellington College, Berkshire, wrote an article in his school magazine warning peers that 'casual sex never works in the long term'.

Mr Lyman - a pupil at the £30,000-per year school which counts author Sebastian Faulks and broadcaster Peter Snow among its alumni - described sex as 'the glue' which connects two people 'physically and emotionally'.

Phin Lyman, 18,  wrote an 
article in the school magazine at Wellington College, Berkshire, outing himself as a virgin and 
encouraging other students to refrain from having 'casual sex'

But he said boys often learned about sex through pornography and thought it was 'just for them' - which would invariably leave girls, who consider sex to be romantic, disappointed. 

According to The Times, Mr Lyman wrote: 'I believe that sex is an incredibly strong symbol of love between two people. Think of it as glue. Once you have sex with someone, you're connected to them emotionally and physically.

'If you tear that bond the rip leaves open scars where the glue once was. That's why 'casual sex' never works in the long term, it just doesn't.'

Mr Lyman, who has written the story for The Wellingtonian, the school's magazine, said he had decided to 'go public' with his virginity because he thought the pressure on younger pupils to have sex was 'depressing'.

He believes 90 per cent of people are drunk when they lose their virginity which 'upsets' him.

He also said most of his friends at the co-educational private school, which was set up in 1859, knew he was a virgin but not many understood the reasons why - which led him to write the article.

Mr Lyman said his classmates at Wellington College in Crowthorne, Berkshire - which costs around £30,000 a
 year to attend - know he is a virgin but do not understand the reasons why

The student also wrote that he had been surprised at the attitude of boys towards girls in their age group.

But he admitted himself that his plan could take 'a lot of self-discipline'.

Mr Lyman said there were 'incredibly good-looking girls' at the school and there had been times when he had been forced to 'take a step back'.

The
 pupil's comment comes just days after it emerged nearly one in ten 
students at British universities admit they first had sex at the age of 
14 or younger.

The shocking survey of more than 6,000 students at 100 universities, carried out by Student Beans, found nine per cent of students admitted they lost their virginity before they reached their 15th birthday, with two per cent saying they had sex before they turned 14.

By the time they reached 16 - the legal age of consent - that figure had risen to almost one in four.

Latest figures from the NHS published in 2011 show the number of young people having sex has dropped.

According to the findings, 27 per cent of men aged between 15 and 24 had not had sex. This compared to 22 per cent in 2001.

Government figures also show young people who admitted drinking alcohol in the previous week had also dropped by one quarter in nine years.

The statistics show 12% of school pupils had drunk alcohol in the last week, compared with 26% in 2001.

One year earlier in 2010, 13% of pupils reported drinking in the last week.

The survey also found that more than half have had unprotected sex while 61 per cent used camera phones to send explicit 
pictures or videos of themselves to partners, known as 'sexting'.

After starting university, more than half admitted to having one-night stands and six per cent said they had already had more than 20 partners. Just eight per cent said they were still virgins.

Norman Wells from the Family Education Trust, which promotes traditional moral values, said: 'The survey underlines the failure of contraceptive-based sex education to prepare young people for lifelong marriages.

'Contrary to the claims of those who assert that marriage is an outdated institution, the overwhelming majority of students expect to get married, with only six per cent saying they do not wish to marry.

'Yet the casual attitudes towards sex suggested by high levels of one night stands and multiple sexual partners indicate that students are ignorant of the character qualities they will need.'

Meanwhile, the latest figures from the NHS published in 2011 show 27 per cent of men aged between 15 and 24 had not had sex, compared with 22 per cent in 2001.

Those who admitted drinking alcohol in the previous week had also dropped by a quarter in that same ten-year period.

Of those aged 11 to 15, one in eight said they had drunk the week before, according to the 2011 NHS figures.

The college, set on 400 acres of land, counts the broadcaster Peter 
Snow, the comedian and impressionist Rory Bremner, the singer Will 
Young and the journalist and author Sebastian Faulks among its alumni.

The
 school was founded in the affluent village of Crowthorne - also know 
for housing maximum-security psychiatric hospital Broadmoor - in 1859.

It was opened in honour of the Duke of Wellington, who led British forces in several large-scale military victories, to educate sons of British Army soldiers.
