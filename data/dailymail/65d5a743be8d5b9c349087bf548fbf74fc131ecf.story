If you are looking for a last-minute Christmas present, look no further than Elizabeth Island, which is now up for sale.

But it will not come cheap, with the island - south-east of Melbourne in Victoria - expected to sell for between $5 million and $10 million.

Elizabeth Island is a 26-hectare property in Westernport Bay and has been owned by Anne Tillig for 18 years.

Elizabeth Island - south-west of Melbourne in Victoria - is up for sale through JP Dixon

It boasts a three-bedroom, two-bathroom home with a wrap-around veranda to enjoy its spectacular ocean views in any weather.

The island is easily accessible by water and has its own helicopter landing pad. 

It is only a 10- to 20-minute boat ride from the Phillip Island town of Rhyll, which is south of Elizabeth Island, where Ms Tillig docks her vessel.

Rhyll is a two-hour drive from the Victorian capital of Melbourne. 

But it can also be accessed from Hastings on the Mornington Peninsula - north-west of Elizabeth Island - which is a 30- to 40-minute boat ride.

A flight onto the island from Melbourne would take about 30 minutes. 

Following the death of her husband Ivan Vit, Ms Tillig is selling up because she wants to do more travelling.

'We've had so many adventures there which I've written about in my book,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

It is expected to sell for between $5 million and $10 million, and expressions of interest open in March

The island has its own jetty and is easily accessible by boat. It also has its own helipad

'After 20 years living on the island, I want to travel a bit more and reluctantly decided to sell it.

'We first went there in 1996 and there was nothing on it and it was surrounded by water with gorgeous swans.'

Ms Tillig - who is a former senior consultant strategic for business planning and worked in data management - said the island retreat was an escape from the busier city life.

In fact, the island had such an impact on her that she was inspired to release a photographic book and a novel about her home.

'When I quit my job and started living there, I felt quite tired and stressed from city living, and within a matter of months I just felt amazingly on top of the world,' she said.

'I went through a process where you feel bored and lonely at first, and then you feel fully engaged with your surroundings. You fully unwind.

'You see the sea, the beautiful bird life, dolphins and seals, and other people have seen whales.'

JP Dixon Real Estate’s Sorrento and Rye director Anastasia Howard told Daily Mail Australia said the island had potential to be expanded with only 'a very comfortable cottage' and large machinery sheds taking up space.

'It is a unique proposition. We obviously don't have many islands for sale and not one as accessible as this,' she said.

'We're calling for expressions of interest in March and we expect it to see for between $5 and $10 million.

'Obviously it's a broad range but we don't know what it's worth yet.'
