The 27-year-old's loan spell is being cut short by Hull having played just nine games for the club

'Hatem Ben Arfa has never been so close to Nice. The attacking midfielder is expected to continue his career in the red-and-black jersey.'

Ben Arfa has endured a contrary time time in England, scoring 14 times in 86 games for Newcastle before appearing nine times for Hull this season.

Although he has shown flashes of brilliance his attitude has been brought into question by Alan Pardew and Steve Bruce.

Hull decided to cut short Ben Arfa's loan deal, with Bruce telling the BBC: 'Sometimes transfers don't work, especially with a loan deal.

'I'm disappointed. We brought him in on a wave of publicity and there has been no fallout or slanging match.

'His views of the game are different to mine. At any club you need to have a certain work ethic to get in the team, that's the frustrating thing.

'I hope Hatem takes in what I've had to say to him because his talent is there for all to see. But talent without hard work means you won't live up to your potential.

'To play for me you have to know you are playing for the team. To be a great you have to be a team player.'
