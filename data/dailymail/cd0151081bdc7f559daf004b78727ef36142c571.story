On high streets where many shops still lie empty as they recover from the worst recession in Britain since the 1930s, one type of business has continued to thrive in the economic gloom.

Bookmakers have swamped the UK's shopping parades – with numbers up 25 per cent since 2008 - and in one London borough, Newham, there are currently 82 - six per square mile.

Around almost every corner in this generally deprived part of East London are shops where people can stake £100 a spin on casino-style gambling machines, which are as addictive as crack cocaine.

Yesterday Newham Council was in court to defend its decision to block plans for a new Paddy Power shop, and if they win it could lead to hundreds of betting shop licences nationwide being turned down or revoked.

The local council say these bookmakers, often open for 14 hours a day, fuel violent crime, street drinking and underage gambling.

A source from within the council said: ‘We mapped out where crimes and disorder take place and compared that with where the betting shops are – and it lit up like a Christmas tree'.

Earlier this year they rejected an application for the new betting shop on the grounds that it would make more money from gaming machines than from traditional betting on horses and sports results, saying this meant it fell foul of the 2005 Gambling Act.

Councillor Ian Corbett, chairman
of the licensing sub-committee, said: ‘We are the first council to 
invoke the primacy clause to reject a licence application, as we are 
unconvinced that at least half of the gambling on premises would have 
been traditional betting.

‘We are increasingly concerned about the number of gaming machines in Newham and their impact on our high streets.

‘Not
only that, we are concerned at the high proportion of incidents of 
crime and disorder and that betting shops are part of the problem.’

Paddy Power has said it will not comment until the case ends, with a decision due by magistrates on Wednesday.

Newham frequently appears high up 
lists of the most deprived areas of Britain, along with nearby London 
boroughs such as Hackney and Tower Hamlets.

It is an area of high immigration, and has been thought to be in serious economic decline since the fall of manufacturing and the closure of the nearby London Docks.

The Olympic Park at Stratford is located within Newham, but it has yet to be seen whether the complex will have its desired effect of revitalising the borough and bringing employment back to the area.

Ali Mil, 32, who runs a phone card stall on Green Street, where the Paddy Power could still appear if they win the legal battle, says that these shops are damaging lives.

'They have a bad effect on young people, it's too easy to lose money. It brings problems to the area. The gambling creates problems: fighting in the streets, drinking. There is a bigger problem coming in the future,' he told the Independent.

Until now, town halls have complained that they can block betting shop applications only if there is evidence that there will be an increase in crime, a threat to the vulnerable, or there is proof of unfair gambling, which is difficult to establish before a shop has opened.

Legal fight: Newham is locked in the courts with Paddy Power as the 
council tries to stop the opening of another betting shop in their area, as they say there are too many (examples in East Ham, above left to bottom right)

Previous decisions to reject applications have often been overturned on appeal. In many cases, councils withdraw their objections as they are liable for costs if they lose. This has led to accusations that councils are being ‘bullied’ by expensive legal teams brought in by the bookies.

The Association of British Bookmakers said previously that Newham’s decision to throw out the application was ‘at odds with the Gambling Commission’s advice and guidance on this issue.

‘There is a misconception that there must be more profit or turnover from betting than machines to satisfy primary gambling activity. That is simply not the case.'
