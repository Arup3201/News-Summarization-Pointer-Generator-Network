Roy Hodgson has announced that midfielder Frank Lampard will be England's vice-captain at this summer's World Cup.

The 35-year-old Chelsea star, who has won 103 international caps and been named captain six times, was skipper when England were last in Brazil a year ago.

'Frank's been the vice-captain all along in Steven [Gerrard]'s absences, which I think has been two, he's stepped up quite brilliantly.

'I've always thought that he was going to be a key member of this 23 because of his experience and what he brings to the team apart from pure footballing ability.

'He brings a lot of other things to us in terms of his leadership qualities and characteristics.'

England will start their World Cup campaign against Italy on June 14 before further Group D clashes with Uruguay and Costa Rica.
