New parents of rare identical triplet girls have revealed that they use a pink Sharpie marker on the babies' feet to prevent a mix-up.

Chad and Amanda Doss from Franklin, Indiana, welcomed their daughters - Avery, Bentley and Cassidy- two months early on December 30. They were finally reunited as a family at home after a prolonged hospital stay on January 29.

Speaking to Today.com about the difficulty of telling their look-a-like 12-week-old infants apart, Mrs Doss, 27, said: 'We keep their initials with Sharpie on the bottom of their feet just in case.''

Which is which? New parents of rare identical triplet girls Chad and Amanda Doss have revealed that they use a pink Sharpie marker on the babies' feet to tell them apart

She added that the girls do have tiny differences which mark them out.

For instance, one of Bentley’s eyelids has a red mark, and Cassidy has a visible vein on her nose.

However the Dosses realize that these facial features could disappear overnight and want to be prepared for this eventuality.

Every night after bath time they reach out for the Sharpie and marker each baby up.

The couple, who have been married three years, are now a family of 
seven in a three-bedroom home.

Mr Doss has two children from a 
previous marriage, Caleb, 12, and Kaitlyn, nine.

Come in threes: Avery, Bentley and Cassidy - born on December 30 - defied the one-in-100-million genetic odds

'The best day ever': Doctors believe that the egg split into three soon after conception in Mrs Doss' (pictured holding Bentley) womb

He revealed in January that he and his wife's triplet daughters were conceived naturally after a vasectomy reversal.

He underwent the procedure in 2012 with the hope of starting a family with his second wife and was shocked by its efficiency

'It’s
 beyond [a] miracle . . . It’s unbelievable,' he exclaimed.

'To feel 
them in my stomach for so long and to finally be able to see them was the best day ever'

Mr Doss' urologist gave him about a 66per cent chance of being able to father a child within the first five years of getting his vasectomy reversed.

The surgery can take up to three to four hours and prices range from $5,000 to $20,000 depending on its complexity.

'We were thinking, we’ll try for one and grow our family just a little bit,' Mr Doss recalled.

His wife said she was overjoyed when she learned she was pregnant.

But when doctors confirmed there were three identical girls, '[that] was just the icing on the cake,' she exclaimed.

Overjoyed: Mr Doss underwent a vasectomy reversal in 2012 with the hope of starting a family with his second wife and was shocked by its efficiency

The Doss' newborns stayed at the neonatal intensive care unit inside St. Vincent Women’s Hospital 
in Indianapolis until they had reached a healthy weight.

Mr

 Doss
 said: 'It’s unbelievable that let alone we had a reversal, but 
then for us to have three and they’re identical, it’s a miracle. We’re 
very blessed.'

Dr. Charles Coddington, a reproductive endocrinologist and president of Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, said naturally occurring identical triplets are so rare there are no studies that establish how often it happens.

'It’s unbelievable that let alone we had a reversal, but 
then for us to have three and they’re identical, it’s a miracle'

Various experts calculate the odds from one-in-one-million to 
one-in-100-million.

Doctors
 believe that the egg split into three soon after conception because the
 babies shared a placenta and chorionic sac but had their own amniotic 
sacs.

Mrs Doss gave birth at 31 weeks just three months after a routine ultrasound revealed that she was carrying three babies.

She told the Indy Star: ‘It was just crazy to see three babies in three beds sitting here and doing well.

‘Seeing
 them for the first time was a very overwhelming experience, to feel 
them in my stomach for so long and just wonder what they will look like 
so to finally be able to see them was the best day ever.’

Instant family: Mrs and Mr Doss, who has two children from a previous marriage (pictured bottom with Mrs Doss), have had to trade in their two cars to buy a minivan to make way for their growing family

After
 more than a month’s bed rest, Mrs Doss was admitted to hospital in 
early December. There she felt contractions but progress was slow until 
her waters broke around midday on the 30th.

Within an hour she had given
 birth to three baby girls.

She said: ‘It was definitely just like in the blink of an eye that it happened.’

The Doss girls were named for their position in the womb though they were not delivered in ABC order.

The
 first to arrive was Avery, who weighed 3lbs 15oz; followed by Cassidy 
at 3lbs 11oz; and last came Bentley, the heaviest at 4lbs 3oz .

The Doss', who married in 2011, traded in their two cars to purchase a minivan for their suddenly big family.

Mrs Doss concluded: 'For the most part, it’s not as 
difficult as I thought it was going to be.

'I pictured 
mass chaos in my head. Now, at this infant stage, they’re pretty easy to
 take care of.'
