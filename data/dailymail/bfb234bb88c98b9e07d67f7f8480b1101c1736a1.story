What we were told last year was happening to Lewis Hamilton may be happening now. We were informed that he was maturing before our eyes, when, in fact, he was plastering himself in tattoos and ostentatiously taking his dog for a walk along the paddock.

It was partly a fabrication of the Mercedes PR machine to portray him in this way. For one thing, Mercedes could not accurately estimate whether he was maturing or not. He had just joined the team.

Improved: Hamilton has won the last three races and is well primed for a proper title challenge

So while they solemnly told us that he was more contented, more rounded, more relaxed than ever, some of us thought he was on a voyage of discovery. He was finding his way, having been set free from the confines of his father’s instruction and Mercedes’ guiding control.

In order to give him the space, Mercedes were laissez-faire. It may well have been a prudent approach to show him love and then, that fundamental bond being established, exercise some hold over him.

That is what they have done in stopping him travelling around the world with his dogs, Roscoe and Coco.

It was evidently absurd for a serious sportsman to parade his bulldogs at work. It was a distraction for him, it was bad for their ears and a pain for those who wiped up after them (a job that should, surely, have been carried out by the owner or staff specifically engaged by him for the purpose).

It is said that Niki Lauda, the Mercedes boss, is behind the move to confine Hamilton’s pets to home – or kennels, or whatever millionaires do with dogs they leave behind.

Lauda’s view is in accordance with every serious commentator in the sport. Take Murray Walker’s words to Sportsmail. He said: ‘I have the utmost respect and admiration for Lewis, but the F1 paddock is no place for a dog.

'Think of the safety reasons. Think, too, of how a dog’s hearing system is infinitely more sensitive than a human’s – and my hearing has been destroyed by F1 cars.

'I am utterly amazed he’s allowed to take the dog in. Whoever said that was OK should be drummed out of the Brownies. I can’t imagine what the hell they are thinking about. It's utter madness.'

Sense has prevailed in the end.

Man's best friend: Hamilton brought his dog Roscoe into the paddock regularly last season

Where was Dr Steve Peters, the renowned psychiatrist, as Liverpool crumpled from 3-0 up to draw 3-3 at Crystal Palace on Monday night?

In Sheffield’s Crucible Theatre watching another of his charges, Ronnie O’Sullivan, lose the World Championship snooker final to the more mentally robust Mark Selby.

The backside was somewhat falling out of the mind-bending business, it seemed.

This impression was reinforced by Hamilton’s welcome comments that he perceives no advantage in engaging such services.

Mind games: Hamilton says he sees no advantage in using a psychiatrist such as Dr Steve Peters (right)

‘Never,' he said when asked if such as Dr Ceri Evans, a psychologist engaged by his Mercedes team in China three weeks ago, would be working with him. ‘Never needed one and will never have one. So we’ll never speak of it again unless I start going crazy.’

My feeling based on conversations with some of the leading sportsmen of the age is that Hamilton speaks for the majority of them. They see no need for some ‘shrink’ to improve their well-tuned, ultra-competitive minds.

I do not decry those who have turned to Peters and his ilk. Victoria Pendleton and Chris Hoy, for two, swear by him. I am just saying – indeed, Hamilton is hinting at the fact – that for most sportsmen their advice is unnecessary.

Susie Wolff, the Williams test driver, aka the world’s fastest woman, appears not to be doing her status as an equal-opportunities employee much good in her casting at the football match played annually before the Monte Carlo Grand Prix.

To see what I mean case your eyes a long way down the list...

Hamilton also said he would never use a psychologist, and you get the feeling his thoughts are echoed in sport
