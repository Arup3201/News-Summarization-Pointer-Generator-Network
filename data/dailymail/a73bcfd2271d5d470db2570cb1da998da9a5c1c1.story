Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli is known for displaying a t-shirt with 'why always me?' splashed on the front of it after scoring for Manchester City against Manchester United - but maybe he should change his catchphrase to 'why always three'.

The Italian forward was pictured with three mobile phones in his hand after completing a training session at Melwood on Thursday.

Balotelli, who is preparing for his side's derby match against Everton, appears to be a big fan of technology or just chooses to have more than one back up phone to hand.

Reds manager Brendan Rodgers has heaped praise on his £16million signing by saying he has the potential to become world-class - but has warned the 24-year-old he must show a higher level of consistency.

'I think Mario is potentially world-class,' said Rodgers. 'You can't compare Luis Suarez and him, but Mario is coming in as an international striker and he's a talent, no doubt.

'Suarez elevated himself, that was clear. He wasn't world-class when he came in but when he left to go to Barcelona he had put himself in that bracket.

'He did that because of his consistency in scoring goals and keeping his performance level high. World-class is about being at the highest level consistently, being at that level in your game consistently. That's what takes you there. '

Balotelli is expected to be included in Liverpool's starting line-up to face Everton on Saturday afternoon with team-mate Daniel Sturridge likely to start on the substitutes' bench after recovering from a thigh injury.

The Liverpool forward has scored just one goal for the Reds since joining from Italian giants AC Milan
