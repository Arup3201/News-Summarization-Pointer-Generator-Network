This summer, I went on holiday to France, leaving behind (thanks to Ryanair's carry-on luggage restrictions) my two beloved possessions: my hairdryer and straighteners.

For three weeks I did nothing to my unruly hair beyond washing it, putting it up in a bun and letting it dry naturally. It was bliss - as relaxing as not checking my emails.

Writer Nora Ephron once said that the upside of death is not having to worry about your hair - it turns out it's the upside of a holiday in the middle of nowhere, too. But a very strange thing happened when I stopped 'doing' my hair - I found my natural hair didn't look that bad.   

Smooth vs wavy: Marianne after taming her curls, left, and more natural look, right

Left to their own devices for once, my locks became a mass of curls and waves. Some days the effect was chaotic, on others it was soft and natural. I grew to like it. So did my travelling companion, who couldn't understand why I'd been hiding my natural curls for so long.

'You should keep it that way when you go home,' she said. 'Seriously, it suits you. And you look less uptight.'

A backhanded compliment, yes, but does she have a point? Back in London, trying to look professional and together, could I really let my hair out on the loose and spend two weeks of my real life without straighteners?

My hairdresser thinks I can. 'You have pre-Raphelite hair, with a lot of texture and curl. You should do nothing to it,' says Lance Lowe, of Lancelot and Carmina salon in Marylebone, London.

And though it seems like a terrifying prospect, I have to admit that it does hold a certain appeal.

Fight the frizz: Marianne has been battling with her hair for years

My adult life has been spent in daily battle against my hair. Thick, wiry and frizzy - naturally the consistency of a Brillo pad - the only way I feel it looks respectable is when a professional does it or when I punish it at home with hair straighteners.

I got my first pair of GHD ceramic straighteners in 2004. It seemed almost miraculous to me that with the flick of a switch I could transform my messy mop into something sleek and smooth. I fell in love.

Soon I was using them almost every day, happily ignoring the damage being done to my split ends by the heat.

Sometimes when, out of laziness, I straightened my hair while it was still damp (which you're not meant to do because it's so damaging) I could hear my hair sizzle. Steam would rise from my head. But no matter! Anything for smooth sleek hair.

 'We've been brain-washed into thinking there's only one way to look good and that's with straight, smooth hair'

And it's not just me. According to one survey, a third of women own a pair of straighteners and a quarter refuse to leave the house without first ironing their hair into Jennifer Aniston-like smoothness. 

But all this straightening comes at a high price. Trichologists are warning us that the damage caused by straighteners can make hair frizzier and curlier, setting up a 'straightener addiction'.

'Repeated straightening at high heat makes the smooth, protective cuticle that surrounds the hair fibres become flaky and rough,' says Iain Sallis, Britain's only hospital trichologist with seven private clinics around the country.

'This makes the hair appear more frizzy and less shiny. Women control this new frizz by straightening the hair more, which dries and damages it further, causing yet more frizzing, which requires more straightening and so on. Eventually hair becomes so damaged that it can break off.' 

What's more, I've found recently that I'm going off the straightened look. During the past decade, it seems as if 90 per cent of the female population has been walking around with straight hair. 

'People have started to look like clones,' says my hairdresser, Lance. 'We've been brain-washed into thinking there's only one way to look good and that's with straight, smooth hair - but that's not true.

'We all look better working with what we've naturally got, instead of fighting against it.'

Lance, who does the hair for catwalk shows including Alexander McQueen, says he's starting to see women trying out fuller, curlier styles. In celeb-land, Rihanna and Nicole Kidman have been pictured recently with natural curls.

While I'm apprehensive, the prospect of clawing back the hours I spend trying to tame it is irresistible.

So, for a fortnight, I will subject the world to my mad, untamed hair and learn to love my curls. How hard can it be? Very, as it turns out.

The first day I walk out with my natural hair, I feel like a mad woman. Maybe it's a damp day or being on the Tube, but my hair has not fallen into curls or waves - it is pure frizz.

I catch my reflection in a shop window and think I look deranged. My hair is just so big.

I realise that with straight, well-behaved hair I blend in, but with my own bushy hair I stand out. I don't like it. I lose my nerve and scrape my hair up into a bun.

There's something liberating about just accepting what you've got; even if it is a giant, messy mop of ginger hair

The next day I go to a meeting with wild hair and feel like an unprofessional mess. I didn't appreciate how much I relied on straightened hair as part of my work armour. 

My colleagues were all kind - but I think they were being diplomatic. One said it looked 'Bohemian' in a way that didn't sound like a compliment.

I realise that the natural look involves work and so start to experiment with different ways to make my hair less of a frizzy mess and more 'natural curl'.

So far the techniques include putting mousse through damp hair and then twisting it into a bun or plaits before I go to bed. When I wake up in the morning I undo the hair and it comes out in nice waves. 

If I want it more bouncy and curly, I use Bumble and Bumble's Curl Conscious Calming Cream (£23.50, bumbleandbumble.co.uk). I run it through my hair when it's wet, then dry it for just a few minutes with a diffuser, which adds volume and curls my hair. 

By the end of the first week I'm starting to get compliments. Girlfriends tell me I look younger and a couple of the more fashionable ones tell me it’s 'cool'. 

The only people not won over are my male friends, who invariably prefer sleek and smooth, which they say is more 'sexy and sophisticated'.

I see their point; there is something about a good blowdry or silky smooth hair that is very touchable and seductive.

But the funny thing is that I don't care too much what anyone thinks. By the end of week two I've learned to love my natural look. There's something liberating about just accepting what you've got; even if it is a giant, messy mop of ginger hair.

So could this be the start of a new me? What next? Ditching the make-up? I don't think so.

But I won't go back to using straighteners every day. For the moment, the GHDs are staying in a box under the bed. The one-woman war against my hair is over.
