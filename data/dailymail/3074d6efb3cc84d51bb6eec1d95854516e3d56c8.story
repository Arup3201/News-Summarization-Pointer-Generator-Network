A London bus was today left hanging partly over the River Thames after a dramatic accident that left three people injured.

The incident at Putney Bridge in south-west London involved a number 424 bus and a car, with the bus believed to have mounted the pavement and slammed through a stone barrier.

The bus driver, who had to be removed from the vehicle by firefighters following the incident at about 10.30am, suffered a chest injury and was taken to a hospital as a precaution.

Saved: The bus driver had to be removed from the vehicle in London by firefighters following the incident

Emergency: Two women - one the driver of the car - were treated at the scene by London Ambulance staff

Two women - one the driver of the car - were treated at the scene by London Ambulance staff. No-one on the red bus, travelling from Putney Heath to Fulham, was hurt.

Pictures appeared on Twitter of the vehicle, which has knocked down part of the bridge, hanging partly over the structure with the rest of the bus on the pavement and its rear in the road.

Witness Peter Leggatt told MailOnline: ‘One of the bystanders there said he had driven over Putney Bridge at 10am and the lights weren’t working. He described it as an accident waiting to happen.

The 24-year-old, whose flat overlooks the scene of the accident, added: ‘A car and a bus emerged at the lights from Putney High Street and Lower Richmond Road at the same time - and, uncertain of right of way, collided. The bus driver, trying to dodge the car, hit the wall of the bridge.’

Putney Bridge was closed to all vehicles except buses and taxis and there are also other road closures in the area. Police said that inquiries were continuing into the incident.

A London Ambulance Service spokesman said on Twitter: 'We're treating three patients at a road traffic collision involving a bus at Putney Bridge. Our staff have taken the Putney Bridge bus driver to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital for treatment for chest injury.'

London Fire Brigade said: ‘We've freed a man who was trapped after a bus collided with Putney Bridge this morning. He, along with two women, were treated by London Ambulance Service.’

And a Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Putney Bridge is currently closed to traffic following a collision involving a bus. Motorists are advised to avoid the area.'

The crash comes one week before Wandsworth Council is due to begin carrying out major repairs to the bridge until this October, to better protect the road surface from water damage.

During the work - which begins next Monday - vehicles, including buses, will not be able to use the bridge. Pedestrians will be able to walk across it, as will cyclists, but they will need to dismount.
