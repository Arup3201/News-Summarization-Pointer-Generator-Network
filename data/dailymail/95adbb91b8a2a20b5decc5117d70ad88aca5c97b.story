He also stated that donors like 'Santa B' are known as 'layaway angels' by the retail giant.

The manager told PennLive.com that 100 layaway balances came to approximately $50,000.

He also stated that 'Santa B' instructed money left over from his check should be donated.

Regarding 'Santa B''s identity, Myers revealed he was from nearby and wanted to remain anonymous.

John Forest Ales, a Wal-Mart spokesman, told the website of the check 'It's not the record, but it's certainly high.' 

Customer:  Brittny Coeyman told a television station 'We were scraping together the last few minutes here to pay for it, we were actually going to have to return a couple things' before her balance was covered

Robert Carolus told the website 'I'm overwhelmed, and I guess relieved. I'm just disappointed I couldn't say thank you.'

Speaking to Fox43, shopper Brittny Coeyman said 'We were scraping together the last few minutes here to pay for it, we were actually going to have to return a couple things.'

She also said, 'Just thank you so much, it’s a miracle for not just us but for so many people. And there’s nothing else I could ask for for Christmas.'

Myers told the affiliate station 'Wow, like you know, we look at these layaway angels, you hear about it but this is so generous, and it’s unbelievable that somebody could do that.'

Last Wednesday, a female 'layaway angel' gave $20,000 to a Bellingham, Massachusetts, Toys R Us, the Associated Press reported.
