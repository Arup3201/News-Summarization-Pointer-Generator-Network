Like clockwork: Edwin James Ross had this mugshot taken when arrested for trespassing

A convicted killer with 'Clockwork Orange' tattooed across his forehead has been arrested in the US.

Edwin James Ross found himself behind bars on Monday night in Eugene, Oregon, for trespassing. 

He was booked into the Lane County jail on a misdemeanor charge.

The most striking thing about his mugshot was his face tattoo - an apparent reference to Stanley Kubrick's 1971 film, famed for its 'ultra-violent' content.

Ross, 33, who was released from custody on Tuesday, has a criminal past.

In 2003, he was arrested on suspicion of murder after being accused of shooting his 19-year-old male friend in the head.

He later pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to nine years in prison.

Last June, he spent time in the Lane County lockup on charges, including domestic violence and reckless burning. 

In act of unusual self-censorship, the controversial film was banned in the UK by director Kubrick in 1973 amid fears it had encouraged gratuitous copycat attacks. 

But the cult classic was still widely shown in America and across Europe and hit British screens again following Kubrick's death in 1999.
