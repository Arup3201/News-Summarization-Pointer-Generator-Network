The next time you order a cup of coffee from KFC, you'll literally be having a sweet brew.

The fast food brand's foray into crockery has seen its research team develop 100 per cent edible coffee cups made from a 'unique' biscuit, wrapped in sugar paper and lined with a layer of heat-resistant white chocolate,

The white chocolate lining, which keeps the coffee hot and the cup crispy, melts over time, slowly softening the biscuit to reveal a 'melt-in-the-mouth' snack.

The restaurant developed the cups to celebrate the launch of Seattle's Best Coffee in its outlets.

The 'Scoff-ee Cup' has been made from a unique biscuit, wrapped in sugar paper and lined with an indulgent layer of heat-resistant white chocolate, which keeps the coffee hot and the cup crispy. 

Over time, the chocolate lining begins to melt, slowly softening the biscuit to reveal a melt-in-the-mouth tasty snack.

Created in partnership with renowned food scientists, The Robin Collective, the sweet treats also have an added benefit of being infused with a selection of subtle scents that complement the coffee experience and are known to improve moods.

Brandy Wright of The Robin Collective said: 'Not only do the edible cups taste amazing but they smell delicious too. 

'We've infused different cups with a variety of ambient aromas including coconut sun cream, freshly cut grass and wild flowers.

'These scents were used in our recipes as they have a natural ability to evoke the positive memories we associate with warm weather, sunshine and summer holidays. Things that make everyone smile.'

Jocelyn Bynoe at KFC said: 'We have been experimenting with edible packaging to see if it could be a feasible product to bring to market in limited quantities and thought that if our customers occasionally like to have their cake and eat it, why wouldn't they want have their cup and eat it instead!'

Made from Fairtrade, 100 per cent Arabica beans, the new Seattle's Best Coffee range is available in KFC restaurants across the UK.

The Scoff-ee Cup is currently under development and not yet available for customers in store.
