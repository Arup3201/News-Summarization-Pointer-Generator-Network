Accused: Paul Hewlett (pictured) is alleged to have been over the legal drink driving limit outside a junior school

An ice-cream man has been accused of drink driving while out on his round serving the school run.

Paul Hewlett, 49, is alleged to have been over the legal limit moments after serving children as they left Parish Church Junior School in Waddon, Croydon, last week.

He was pulled over in an ice cream van by police where he was arrested just before 4.30pm.

Officers arrived after receiving reports earlier in the week from concerned parents.

The van, believed to belong to a friend of Mr Hewlett, was seized by police and taken to a compound.

The 49-year-old will appear at Croydon Magistrates' Court next week charged with drink driving and driving without valid insurance.

Shocked parents said the van was parked outside school at the end of classes most days, sometimes driven by Mr Hewlett, and at other times by a second man.

Jennifer Bentsi-Enchill, who has two children at Parish Church, says she was 'horrified' to hear of the arrest.

The 42-year-old said: 'The van is here almost every day, even when the weather is not that nice serving kids.'

Taken away: Scotland Yard has decided to seize the ice cream van and take it to a compound

Barry Watkins saw the van being seized.

He said: 'I thought it was funny at first, an ice-cream van being towed away. Then the policeman told me what had happened. It is terrible really.'

Mr Hewlett, who lives close to where he was arrested, declined to comment on the charges ahead of his court appearance.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
