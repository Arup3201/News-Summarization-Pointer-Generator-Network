Slicing through a spiral of azure blue water, these professional surfers look more like they have been caught in a washing machine than taking on the might of the Pacific Ocean.

The extreme sportsmen were enjoying 'tow surfing', which enables surfers to chase down and catch giant waves using a boat to take them out to meet the biggest walls of water.

However, the rushing water seemed to prove too much for record-breaking surfer Garrett McNamara as he took a tumble from his board while battling the waves off the coast of Tahiti, as captured in these dramatic photographs.

The 45-year-old American big wave surfer is famous in the world of water-sports after he broke the record for the largest wave ever surfed, surviving a monstrous wave off the coast of Nazare in Portugal, and riding tidal waves from glaciers in Alaska.

Mr McNamara was just one of the surfers who hit the waters of the French Polynesian coast for a free surf tow session, where boats are used to tow surfers out to sea and into a breaking wave, beyond where they would be able to paddle with their bare hands.

Also enjoying the surf were Mr McNamara's fellow American Mark Healey, as well as French surfers Raimana Van Bastolaer and Manoa Drollet.

The practice has been popular since the mid-1990s, although some critics and environmentalists dislike the noise and exhaust created by the tow vessels.

Tahiti is a popular destination for thrill-seeking surfers, with the village of Teahupo'o particularly famous for its surf break and waves which can reach up to 21ft tall.

It plays host to the annual Billabong Pro Tahiti surf competition and is part of the Association of Surfing Professionals world tour circuit.Â
