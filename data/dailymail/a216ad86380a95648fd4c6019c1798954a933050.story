Most 11 year olds would be daunted by the prospect of competing against adults, but American golf prodigy Lucy Li even had time to show off a trick shot or two during her practice round.

Li, who this week will become the youngest player to take part in the women's US Open, looked at home at Pinehurst on Wednesday as she prepared to take on a course that has got the better of some of the world's best golfers. 

Li faced the media on Tuesday and explained why she loved the sport, saying: 'Anybody can play it, (whether) you're tall, short, fast or slow.'

Earlier in the day, Li went around Pinehurst No 2 with Spain's Beatriz Recari who hailed the young star as 'fearless' and even predicted she was 'going to do well' this weekend. She added: 'It's good to see youngsters not afraid to compete.'

However, not everyone is happy at Li's presence this weekend, with world No 1 Stacy Lewis questioning whether it was too early for Li to be playing with adults.

On Wednesday, however, Li looked could not have looked more happy and surely everyone hopes that smile is still present on Sunday - regardless of how Li performs.

Li qualified for the Open after winning at Half Moon Bay in California last May.
