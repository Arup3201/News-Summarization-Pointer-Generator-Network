Most parents teach their children how to make animal noises at a young age.

But one father from Newcastle in New South Wales has turned his one-year-old daughter into an internet sensation by teaching her how to make sounds of car engines.

Pete Witt's video of his daughter Daisy Annabel has racked up almost 200,000 views and more than 2500 shares on Facebook since he posted it four days ago.

Daisy Annabel Witt, from Newcastle, has become an internet sensation with her imitations of car engines

A video of the one-year-old has racked up almost 200,000 views and more than 2500 shares on Facebook

In the clip Mr Witt, 32, asks his daughter: 'Daisy, what does a two-stroke say?'

Straight away she responds saying: 'Ring ding ding.'

Daisy is also quick to identify the noises made by a V8 ('Vroooooom!'), a turbo ('Whaach!').

The funniest part of the video comes when Mr Witt asks Daisy: 'And when we beat somebody at the lights, what do we say?'

'Chopped!' Daisy answers her father.

Since posting the video online Mr Witt, a Holden enthusiast, has been overwhelmed by its popularity.

Mr Witt, who is a pastor at Hunter Bible Church, said he started teaching Daisy how to make car noises in the bath but never imagined his daughter would eventually go viral.

'It's just us mucking around in the bath, and me filming it for a couple of lads at church and it blowing up in our face,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

Mr Witt said Daisy was now building up a repertoire of engine sounds.

'She knows tractor and rotary and we're working on Volkswagen,' he said.

But Mr Witt said he didn't teach Daisy to say 'Chopped' intentionally, she just picked up the word by imitating him in the car.

'It just kind of happened in the backseat of the car, if we overtook someone I just said "chopped",' he said.

'And she started saying it all by herself, if we overtook someone she'd say chopped.

'Now if you do a scissors action with your hand she'll say "chopped" on cue.'

Since the video went viral, Mr Witt has even been sent a gif someone  made of Daisy.
