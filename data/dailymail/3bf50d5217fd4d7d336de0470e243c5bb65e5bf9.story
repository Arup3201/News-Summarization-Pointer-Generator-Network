Three women from the same family are to undergo drastic surgery after they were all diagnosed with a mutated gene that puts them at an exceptionally high risk of developing cancer.

Cath Gilroy, her daughter Clare Shaw and her sister Elaine Price will all have their breasts, ovaries and fallopian tubes removed in a pre-emptive strike against the disease.

Doctors discovered the faulty BRACA2 in Mrs Gilroy, 53, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, after she was diagnosed with breast cancer two years ago.

Cath Gilroy, her daughter Clare Shaw and her sister Elaine Price (l-r) all have a mutated gene that puts them at an exceptionally high risk of developing cancer. But their relative Jo Johnson (far right), has tested negative

After she tested positive, Mrs Gilroy discovered there was a 50 per cent chance her daughter and sisters could also have the gene.

Testing revealed that her daughter Clare, 36, and her sister Elaine, 44, and both possessed the mutation – giving them up to an 85 per cent chance of developing the disease.

While having the gene tests, Ms Price was given the devastating news that she also had the early stages of cervical cancer.

Thankfully, Mrs Gilroy's other sister, 49-year-old Joanne Johnson, tested negative.

Studies have shown that undergoing a mastectomy can reduce the risk of developing breast cancer by up to 90 per cent. Removing the ovaries reduces the risk of ovarian cancer by 85 per cent.

Ms Shaw has already had her ovaries 
and tubes removed and said that despite the trauma of the operation - and 
the fact it brought on the menopause - the decision had been a ‘no 
brainer’.

The 
mother-of-one said: ‘It was a choice between an 85 per cent risk or the 
surgery.

'It was something I decided I needed to do for myself and for my
son.

Coincidence or genetic? Both Mrs Gilroy's grandmother (left) and mother (right) suffered with breast cancer

Functioning BRACA1 and BRACA2 genes are very important in preventing tumour growth.

A faulty BRACA 2 gene is very rare, affecting less than one in 500 people.

It puts women at a higher risk of developing breast, ovarian and fallopian cancer.

Men with with a faulty BRACA2 gene are also at a higher risk of breast cancer.

Most women's lifetime chance of developing breast cancer is 10 per cent, but this goes up to 85 per cent if you possess a mutated BRACA2 gene.

Not all people who possess a faulty BRACA gene will go on to develop cancer.

Surgery is not always necessary if a person tests positive. Surveillance and drugs taken as a preventative measure are options.

‘The test has 
also identified my aunt's cervical cancer -  she wouldn't have known if she 
hadn't been tested, so it has ultimately saved her life.’

Ms Price, who was diagnosed with cervical cancer three weeks ago, said she was ‘quite confident’ about her prognosis and that she had ‘no doubt’ that without the tests, the cancer would not have been discovered.

The 44-year-old said testing positive for the gene had come as no surprise to her as there was ‘too much cancer in our family’.

Mrs Gilroy asked to be genetically tested as both her mother and grandmother had suffered from breast cancer and her brother had died from stomach cancer aged 52.

She said her grandmother, May Leach, had
a mastectomy and lived for 20 years after she was diagnosed with breast
cancer aged 70.

Her mother, Clare Price, did not have a mastectomy,
and died in 1992 from breast cancer, aged 60.

Despite this, she says she had to
demand the genetic test from doctors.

She was  told she did not have enough 
family history to be tested on the NHS and would have to pay £600.

She said: ‘I dread to think what would have happened if I had walked away.’

She has since found out her 15-year-old grandson has a 50 per cent chance of having the gene and will be tested when he is 18.

Former pop star Michelle Heaton had a double mastectomy after being diagnosed with the faulty BRACA2 gene

Despite her risk of cancer, Mrs Gilroy has been waiting for 10 months to have the operation at Wythenshawe Hospital.

She said she is not seen as priority because it is a 'preventative' operation.

She now wants to make other people aware of 
the gene and urge them to get tested as it could save their lives. She 
does not believe there is enough information and support available.

She added: ‘I would urge people that if they think there is a link, to get tested.'

Former pop star Michelle Heaton had a double mastectomy last year, aged 33, after she discovered she carried the faulty BRCA2 gene.

The Liberty X star has raised the profile of genetically-linked cancer and filmed a documentary about her story.

Martin Ledwick, head information nurse at Cancer Research UK, said: ‘Women with a strong family history of breast cancer can speak to their GP, who can refer them to a specialist breast clinic for a genetic test.

‘If you're worried about your risk or have any questions about cancer, you can call Cancer Research UK's nurses on freephone 0808 800 4040.’
