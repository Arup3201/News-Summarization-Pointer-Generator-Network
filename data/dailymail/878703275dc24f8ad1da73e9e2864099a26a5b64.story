President Obama has nominated former assistant attorney general Thomas Perez as the next labor secretary, filling yet another second-term Cabinet vacancy.

Mr Obama’s newest cabinet member will play a crucial role in the administration’s efforts to raise the minimum wage and reform immigration laws.

Perez is the only Latino nominated to Obama's second-term Cabinet so far. Speaking at a brief ceremony in the White House’s East Room, the president said Perez was a ‘consensus builder’ whose ‘story reminds us of this country’s promise.’

Newest member: President Obama today nominated the Assistant Attorney General of Justice Department's Thomas Perez, right, as his choice for labor secretary

Appointment: Obama said Perez is a 'consensus builder'; if appointed, Perez is expected to help the administration on its stance on immigration and minimum wage

The president 
continued: ‘Tom’s made protecting that promise for everybody the cause 
of his life,’ as the nominee stood next to the president.

The 
Harvard-educated civil rights attorney is expected to face opposition 
from some Republican senators, who say he has been too aggressive on 
certain immigration issues, and too political.

Before taking the job as 
assistant attorney general, Perez was secretary of Maryland's Department
of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, which enforces state consumer 
rights, workplace safety and wage and hour laws.

In
choosing the 51-year-old Perez, the son of immigrants from the 
Dominican Republic, Obama would be placing an already high-ranking 
Hispanic official in a Cabinet slot.

Perez would replace Hilda Solis, a former California 
congresswoman and the nation's first Hispanic labor secretary.

Perez's nomination has been expected for weeks, and comes with vigorous support from labor unions and Latino groups.

But
a newly released report by the Justice Department's inspector general 
is likely to provide fodder for Republicans who say the Justice 
Department's Civil Rights Division has been too politicized.

Background: Perez, a Harvard graduate and civil rights lawyer, would replace Hilda Solis

The
report, released last week, said Perez gave incomplete testimony to the
U.S. Commission on Civil Rights when he said the department's political
leadership was not involved in the decision to dismiss three of the 
four defendants in a lawsuit the Bush administration brought against the
New Black Panther Party.

The report also concluded that Perez did not intentionally mislead the commission and that the department acted properly.

Republican
Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa said Perez appeared to be 'woefully 
unprepared to answer questions' from the Civil Rights Commission.

Lynn
Rhinehart, general counsel at the AFL-CIO, said the report shows that 
Perez, who was first hired by the civil rights division as a career 
attorney under President George H.W. Bush, restored integrity to the 
voting rights program at the Justice Department.
