An Egyptian TV channel which broadcasts round-the-clock clips of women belly-dancing has been ordered off air for operating without a licence and showing adverts which 'arouse viewers'.

Women are seen cavorting in their costumes 24-hours a day on the channel called al-Tet.

It was also accused of airing adverts for sexual-enhancement products and promoting matchmaking, according to the Egyptian court statement.

Shake: The channel, called al-Tet, has been accused of arousing viewers and broadcasting illegally with its clips of belly-dancing

But its director, Baleegh Hamdy, has vowed not pull the plug on the show and accused the court using inaccurate evidence when it made its decision.

He told Al Arabiya: 'The judge was supposed to check the facts present in the lawyer's allegations.

'The channel does not air ads for sexual products that aren’t licensed.

'There are more than 150 channels in Egypt airing the same ads for the same products. Why are people picking on al-Tet?'

Bit near the mark: Egypt's administrative court said on Saturday that the channel was operating without a broadcasting licence

Mr Hamdy explained the channel had a licence and that it is aired through a satellite provider in Bahrain called Noorsat.

But he added that Noorsat had stopped broadcasting the channel after the court ruling.

However, despite the set back, the director is now planning to launch a new channel called 'Bom Tak' and another on YouTube which will show more belly-dancing.

Many channels like al-Tet opened in Egypt after the 2011 uprising against Hosni Mubarak.

Al-Tet now has channels in the U.S. and Canada and its owners is believed to be American. 

A spokesman for Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood said the movement welcomed the court decision to shut down al-Tet.

Abdel Haleem Behiry, the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice newspaper deputy editor-in-chief, said: 'The judicial system is one of the factors that can protect the society’s values, which both Muslims and Christians agree on.'
