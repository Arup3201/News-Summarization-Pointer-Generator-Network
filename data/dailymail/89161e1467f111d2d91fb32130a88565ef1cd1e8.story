Gone are the Hollywood waves of award seasons past as last night's BAFTA and Grammy awards saw many celebs opt for a chin-skimming hairdo.

Kim Kardashian led the charge, swapping her long ebony locks for a  side-parted, messy shoulder-length 'do that framed her perfectly made-up face.

And Rosamund Pike, Taylor Swift and Katy Perry were all among the red-carpet starlets to forsake their flowing tresses in favour of the fuss-free wavy bob, dubbed the 'wob'.

Katy Perry gave the trend a pop of colour with her bright lilac coloured tresses at the Grammys and British beauty Jenna Coleman kept hers practical at the BAFTAs by pinning the stylish bob but letting tendrils fall around her face.

Gone Girl star Rosamund Pike - who recently showcased an undercut beneath her wob - swept her hair to the side, and tucking one side behind an hear.

The flattering hairstyle perfectly accessorised with her simple black halterneck gown and showed off her emerald and diamond earrings.

The wob look has already seen several A-listers convert from their flowing hair to short and sweet and Beyonce and Sienna Miller were early adopters of the low-maintenance 'do.

Taylor Swift has long been a convert of the bob and was championing the trend at last night's Grammys, while fellow blonde Rosamund Pike joined the trend for the choppy hair style at the BAFTAs

Katy Perry made the wob trend personal by dying tresses a bold lilac and sweeping hair over to one side

Cut to chin-length, the red carpet crop is easily identifiable by its loose, textured waves, rather than a sleek, polished finish.

Luke Hersheson, who created Sienna Miller's cut, told The Times how he achieved the  actress's new style: 'I didn't want it to look like she'd been to an expensive hairdresser. It almost looks as if it has grown into itself and become that way without the help of a hairdresser.'

Built on an undercut, wob tendrils are chopped to look like torn, untreated ends, which can then be scrunched up to create messy waves.

The deliberately messy, soft cut is a far cry from the sleek bob or elaborate up-dos we're used to seeing on the red carpet.

One of the pioneers of loose hair textures and messy chic is Alexa Chung who rarely wears her scruffy-chic style below her chin.

George Northwood, the man behind Alexa's wob, said: 'Women want to look like they've made no effort.

'A good, undone cut is the secret - chopped into, so it's easier to manage.'

To create the red carpet wob at home, he recommended trying salt spray or touching up the bottom pieces with a curling iron for that coveted tousled look.

Other celebrity fans of the laid-back hairstyle include Dame Helen Mirren (left) and Beyonce (right)
