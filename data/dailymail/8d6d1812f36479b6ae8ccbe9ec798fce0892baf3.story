A homeowner who shot two intruders who broke into his home has been charged with gun possession.

Harold Williams, 42, of Fayetteville, North Carolina shot the two men, Roy Lee Hawk, 27, and Martize Douglas, 23, who said they were armed, as they forced their way into his home on Friday evening.

Both men were injured in the incident, as Hawk on Saturday was listed in critical condition and Douglas was listed in serious condition. 

Williams was not harmed during the incident.

Police said the homeowner is a convicted felon and is not supposed to be in possession of a gun - he has since been charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.

Hawk and Douglas have been charged with breaking and entering, common law robbery and felonious conspiracy. 

Responding officers arrived at the scene of the incident on March 13 at about 5.13pm following a report of a home invasion, according to WNCN.

Hawk and Douglas broke into Williams' home while demanding money and property in the house.

At the point that they announced they were armed, Williams took his handgun and shot them both.

Douglas fled the scene before going to the hospital two hours later, while Hawk was unable to move due to his injuries, according to WRAL.

He left the home once emergency responders arrived and took him to Cape Fear Valley Medical Center.

Investigators said the intruders were on active GPS monitoring through NC probation patrol, according to ABC 11.

Once they are released from hospital, they will be taken to the Cumberland County jail.

The home invasion was not a random act authorities said and the investigation is ongoing.
