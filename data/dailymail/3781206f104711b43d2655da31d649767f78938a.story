Paris Saint Germain's tenacity paid off as the defending champions earned a deserved 1-1 draw at French league leaders Lyon on Sunday, after Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored a penalty at the second time of asking.

Sweden striker Ibrahimovic  equalised in the 69th minute having seen in his initial attempt kept out by Anthony Lopes.

But Ibrahimovic was given the opportunity to redeem himself after the referee penalised Lyon's players for running into the area before he had taken his kick, and the striker lashed his second attempt into the top corner as Lopes dived the opposite way.

PSG created the best chances but struggled with efficiency in front of goal as Lopes made several outstanding saves.

The result left Lyon two points above Marseille and PSG.

Knowing that a victory would lift them to the top of standings, PSG started at a quick pace although the hosts created the first big chance in the 11th minute when Corentin Tolisso fired from 25 meters but saw his drive rattle PSG keeper Salvatore Sirigu's right post.

PSG responded immediately after Maxime Gonalons gave the ball away to Ibrahimovic in his own half. With no space in front of him, the Sweden striker passed the ball to Edinson Cavani who lost his duel with Lopes.

PSG's best chance of the first half came 10 minutes later from a corner that defender David Luiz headed wide from close range after Cavani flicked it on at the near post.

While the visitors lacked a cutting edge, Cameroon striker Clinton N'Jie put Lyon ahead with a clinical finish from six yards from Nabil Fekir's pass in the 31st minute.

PSG midfielder Blaise Matuidi wasted another chance before the interval, sending his shot over the bar after being set up by Marquinhos.

PSG pressed relentlessly in the second half and Ibrahimovic came close twice with headers that forced Lopes to excellent saves.

PSG's efforts were finally rewarded in the 66th minute when Marco Verratti earned a penalty after a contact in the box with defender Lindsay Rose. 

Lopes made another outstanding save to deny Ibrahimovic's kick, but the referee ordered it to be retaken after players encroached on the area, with Ibrahimovic finding the top left corner to put the teams level.
