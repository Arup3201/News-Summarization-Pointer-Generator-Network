The Capital One Cup clash against Liverpool on Tuesday night will be tricky in more ways than one for Chelsea, having lost to League One side Bradford at the weekend.

However, Jose Mourinho has proved he is capable of inspiring his team to bounce back in the past.

Here, Sportsmail looks at some of the more famous cases. 

Porto 1 Real Madrid 3 (October 2003)

Jose's Champions League campaign with Porto could not have got off to a worse start. But, despite a heavy group stage defeat to Real Madrid, it was Porto’s only loss in that season’s competition as Mourinho’s side went on an incredible run to beat Monaco in the final.

Middlesbrough 3 Chelsea 0 (February 2006)

After winning the title in his first season at Chelsea, Jose’s side had only lost once in 25 games the following season before losing at Middlesbrough. Three straight wins followed, ensuring they stayed at the top of the table where they remained until the end of the season.

Borussia Dortmund 4 Real Madrid 1 (April 2013)

Robert Lewandowski stunned Madrid with four goals in an astonishing first leg of the Champions League semi-final. Despite winning their next four games, including the return leg at the Bernabeu, it ruined Jose’s chances of winning Madrid a 10th European title and he was gone at the end of the season.
