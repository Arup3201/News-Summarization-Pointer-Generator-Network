Police launched a murder hunt today after a man was beaten to death at a party just yards from the V Festival site in Essex.

Officers were called to a house on the A414 near the festival site in Hylands Park, Chelmsford, where 90,000 fans were being entertained by a line-up that included Stone Roses and Noel Gallagher, Keane and Ed Sheeren.

In the garden of the property they found the body of a 39-year-old man.

detailed statements are being taken from his friends.

The immediate family of Mr Brockhurst have been informed of the tragedy.

A

unexplained and police are keen to speak to anyone else at the V 
Festival who may have information or may have seen the male during the 
evening.'

at the site overnight, said: 'We are very saddened by the tragic death 
of this young man and we are working to establish the full facts and
