Waring: NHS England chief executive Sir David Nicholson said the health service could not be allowed to 'muddle through'

The NHS is on the verge of running out of money and will face a £30billion shortfall by the end of the decade, health officials warned today.

Bold changes will have to be made to services, including closing hospitals and merging GP surgeries, to end the culture of ‘muddling along’ which threatens the existence of free healthcare in England.

NHS England boss Sir David Nicholson warned of ‘really difficult choices’ about what care is available to cope with an ageing population, more long-term conditions and tighter budgets.

A major report by NHS England warns that if the health service continues operating as it is there will be a funding gap of £30 billion between 2013 and 2021.

Without a major overhaul of treatment and services there could be a repeat of the Mid Staffs scandal in which up to 1,200 patients needlessly died as a result of poor care and neglect.

‘Without bold and transformative change to how services are delivered, a high quality yet free at the point of use health service will not be available to future generations,’ NHS England warned.

Officials have not yet decided how the health service must change and have decided to open up national debate to ‘flesh out the no-go areas’.

Sir David, who is due to retire next year, said the NHS was in danger of ‘sleepwalking its way to a place where we are presiding over a general reduction in standards.’

After the public debate on the challenges, local health authorities will develop plans on how the health landscape will change in each region.

He added: ‘We need to create £30 billion worth of resource in the NHS by cutting off the increase in demand through things like prevention, we need to do it by changing services so that they are delivered in different environment and we need to drive efficiency in the system.

‘The reason it is so important that we have this conversation now is at the end of this year, we are going to have to make some really big, serious decisions about the way in which we invest and allocate resources in 2014-15 and 2015-16.

‘We don't believe (those decisions) can be made in isolation at the centre, nor without proper discussions with the public and patients on how we make that happen.’

He said the health service cannot ‘muddle and sleep walk’ through the challenges it faces or there could be more instances of care failing such as those witnessed in the Stafford Hospital scandal.

He added that the current regulatory system around making changes is ‘very slow’ and said that he will be asking the Government to assess how the process can be sped up.

However, plans to make changes to health services have been ferociously opposed in the past.

For instance, the streamlining of children's heart surgery services ended up in a bitter legal dispute.

Campaign groups in Stafford are battling to maintain services at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust - even though Stafford Hospital was at the centre of a care scandal that rocked the system to its core.

NHS England said that moves such as the centralisation of services - where care is concentrated in a few specialist centres to ensure quality of care - would form part of the transformation.

Medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh said that a number of services had the potential to be concentrated at fewer specialist centres, such as treatment for heart attacks and strokes, operations on veins and arteries and bowel surgery.

He said that some services would only need be centralised for a limited time, giving the example of pacemakers - in the past the devices, which regulate a patient's heartbeat, could only be implanted by specialist doctors in a small number of centres, but now the procedures are conducted regularly in any hospital which employs a cardiologist.

Pressure: The health service needs to adapt to cope with an ageing population and more people living with long-term conditions

Officials also said that patients will also have to take ‘greater control of their health’ - particularly those with long term conditions such as diabetes, depression, dementia and high blood pressure.

The new design must provide better services for preventing disease, they said. At present only 4 per cent of the budget is spent on prevention but officials want to examine whether this can be ‘scaled-up over time’.

They also said health systems would have to harness emerging technologies more "efficiently and effectively" and hospitals will also have to look at delivering care differently.

For instance, at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust in London experts have developed a "e-intensive care unit" where specialists remotely monitor patients using high definition cameras, two-way audio systems and other instruments that keep track of patients' vital signs.

In a new document, titled ‘A Call to Action’, officials said: ‘The NHS is one of our most precious institutions. We need to cherish it, but we also need to transform it.

‘Future trends threaten its sustainability and that means making some tough decisions now to ensure its future is guaranteed.

‘Even protecting the budget will not address the financial challenges ahead. If the NHS is to survive another 65 years it must change.

‘Preserving the values that underpin a universal health service, free at the point of use, will mean fundamental changes to how we deliver and use health and care services.’
