England fullback Sam Tomkins has been ruled out for up to six weeks with a knee injury.

The former Wigan favourite, who celebrated his 26th birthday on Monday, suffered a partial tear of the posterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during the New Zealand Warriors' round-three win over Parramatta at Mount Smart Stadium at the weekend.

Tomkins, who was an ever-present for the Warriors in his first season in the National Rugby League in 2104, is expected back in either late April or early May.

'The outcome is a lot better than it could have been,' coach Andrew McFadden told the club's official website www.warriors.co.nz.

'Sam will rehab the injury and should be available again in a few weeks. Obviously it's a setback being without a player of his quality but it's also a big opportunity for Tui (Lolohea)'
