Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire sex offender friend of the Duke of York, has suffered a major setback in his attempts to rehabilitate his shattered reputation.

An appeal court in New York has ruled that he must register in the state as the highest and most dangerous level of sex offender.

The money manager’s links with Prince Andrew came out just a few months before the latter stepped down in July as a UK trade envoy following a series of scandals.

The prince was among a string of celebrity friends who rallied around Epstein by visiting his Manhattan home after he was released from a Florida prison where he has served 13 months for soliciting a 14-year-old for prostitution.

At the same time, Epstein and his army of high-powered lawyers were fighting to lower his sex offender status.

Epstein even told reporters his offence would not even be considered a crime in New York and compared it to 'stealing a bagel'.

But a New York appeal court has disagreed, ruling that he remains at 'high risk' to repeat his offence and poses a 'threat to public safety'.

Although Epstein, 58, only admitted to one count of sex crimes, he was allowed to settle more than two dozen civil claims by other teenage girls who said they were paid for sex or sexually-charged massages at his Palm Beach mansion.

Virginia Roberts was one of at least 17 women who settled lawsuits with Epstein in 2005 over the scandal

The girls have been unable to discuss their cases as part of payout deals that are believed to have cost Epstein millions of dollars.

But the New York court noted there was 'clear and convincing evidence' that he committed offences against the other girls.

Police who handled the Epstein case have suggested he got off too lightly and the New York court’s judgement appeared to agree, describing Florida’s treatment of the financier as 'unclear'.

As a Level 3 offender, Epstein will have to spend the rest of his life informing police of his whereabouts and internet activities.

He must report to a local police station every year to have his photo taken and verify his address every 90 days with law enforcers. Epstein will even have to tell police what email addresses and web search engines he uses.

He can move to other states or countries but must notify the local police and will be subject to local laws on sex offenders.

Epstein moves between homes in Palm Beach, Manhattan, New Mexico, Paris and the US Virgin Islands. He will have to register as a sex offender in each place.

Epstein’s failure to downgrade his sexual offender status is hardly likely to encourage his many famous friends to want to be seen with him.

Prince Andrew stayed with him at his New York mansion in February, just a month after he was released from prison, and the pair were photographed walking together in Central Park.

Palace officials are understood to be worried about the prince’s relationship with Epstein with lawyers for some of his alleged victims pushing for new criminal charges to be brought against him.
