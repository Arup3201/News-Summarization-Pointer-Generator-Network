John Galliano's fashion workshop at Parsons has been cancelled because the shamed designer refused to participate in 'a frank discussion of his career' with students.

The shamed designer - who was forced out of his role as creative director for Christian Dior after footage of him making racist and anti-Semitic comments emerged online - was set to lead a three-day course titled 'Show Me Emotion' at the New York institute.

However an email sent to students states that Paris-based Mr Galliano, 52, refused to compromise with the requests made by the teaching facility

Back to the day job: John Galliano's workshop at Parsons The New School for Design has been cancelled

In the email, obtained by website Fashionista, Parsons writes: 'It was a condition of our agreeing to host Mr. Galliano that we also hold a larger forum, which would include a frank discussion of his career.

'Ultimately, an agreement could not be reached with Mr. Galliano regarding the details of that forum, and so the program will not move forward.'

The masterclass was set to include
a three-day workshop and a final assessment carried out by Mr Galliano 
and Simon Collins, Dean of Parsons.

Its cancellation comes shortly after an 
anonymous petition, now holding over 2,000 signatures, was launched in a bid 
to ban Mr Galliano from teaching.

Keeping his head down: Mr Galliano, who was the head designer at Christian Dior for 15 years, has kept a low profile since his arrest, attending rehab for alcoholism and doing a temporary residency at Oscar de la Renta

It reads: 'It doesn't matter if it's for
three months or three days, hiring someone who has made such horrific 
comments shows that the school values Galliano over their entire Jewish 
student body.

'It shows they value him over their 
students' respect, peace of mind, and heritage. It is disgraceful to 
hire someone who has made such inhumane comments.'

It also triggered a torrent of commentary. One person wrote on the website: 'By 
letting him back into the broad public influence, it sends the wrong 
message that his anti-Semitic remarks can be swept under the rug.'

Another stated: 'A teacher's ethics are 
inherent in what they teach, and I do not feel that Galliano is the kind
of person that should be teaching young minds.'

Questionable ethics: The petition made reference to Mr Galliano's disrespect towards the entire Jewish student body at Parsons, located in New York's Greenwich Village

The John Galliano-taught class was previously 
described as 'a dynamic and intimate opportunity for students to learn 
from an immensely talented designer . . .Â  [and] about the challenges and complications of leading a 
design house in the 21st century.'

The letter goes on to acknowledge the designer's sordid past. 'We
believe that over the past two years Galliano has demonstrated a 
serious intent to make amends for his past actions,' it stated.

Mr Galliano was arrested in February 2011 after a video showed him uttering anti-Semitic remarks to group of people at a Paris cafe whom he assumed were Jewish.

'I love Hitler,' the designer slurs drunkenly in the clip. 'People like you would be dead. Your mothers, your forefathers, would all be f****** gassed,' he continued.

Since the scandal, Mr Galliano has attended rehab for alcoholism and carried out a temporary residency at Oscar de la Renta, where he received rave reviews for his contribution to the designer's fall 2013 show.
