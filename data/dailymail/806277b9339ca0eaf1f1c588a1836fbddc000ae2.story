Security forces in Pakistan have detained an American diplomat at an airport after they claimed bullets were found in his luggage.

Police said the man was held at Peshawar Airport today and that heÂ  claimed to be an American diplomat.

A U.S. Embassy official said the mission 'was looking into the report'.

Pakistani police officer Dost Mohammad Khan said the man was detained in Peshawar city, where the U.S. has a large consulate.

He said the suspect had 13 bullets in his luggage and was due to fly to the capital, Islamabad.

The presence of American diplomats inside Pakistan emerged as a sensitive issue after a CIA contractor killed two Pakistani men in the eastern city of Lahore a year ago.

U.S. officials insisted the shooter had diplomatic immunity, but Pakistan held him in jail for around two months, causing severe strain in U.S-Pakistan ties.

The unilateral American-raid which killed Osama bin Laden in an army town in May last year also led to a fresh wave of suspicion against Western diplomats by the Pakistani security establishment, which was apparently stung by the realisation that the CIA agents were operating in the country without its knowledge.
