Mechanics are given some nutty jobs, but this one beats them all.

Three grey squirrels had to be dragged kicking and squealing from a crumbling Ford wheel arch after they turned it into their nest.

A video shows a bemused worker at a garage in Lansdale, Pennsylvania, extracting the snarling rodents one by one and hurling them into a box.

Driving out the wildlife: A Ford mechanic in Lansdale, Pennsylvania, had a nuttier job than usual when he was called on to extract three squealing squirrels from a Ford's wheel arch. Here he begins looking for the animals

King Of The Road(ents)! He extracts the first squirrel, saying: 'When they growl like that they're p****d'

The new car was at Yocum Ford when the animals decided to make their home inside the snug, warm wheel arch.

So the diesel technician, who posted the video on LiveLeak yesterday, had to extract them from the wheel arch before he could sell the car.

They had chewed apart part of the fabric of the car and the arch was full of dead leaves by the time they were evicted.

Staff gathered round and held out a box for the startled animals to call their new home as the technician said wisely: 'When they growl like that they're p****d.'

The tale had a happy ending as all the squirrels survived intact.

But there is a surprise at the end of the video - where the technician gets a huge shock while looking for their mother.

Tail with a happy ending: All three of the squirrels survived intact, despite making their nest in an unusual place

Grey squirrels often gnaw their way through gutters to raise their litters in roofs, where they chew through insulation and electrical wires to cause a headache for their new neighbours.

The use of cars is a bit less common - but when the animals are taken away from the countryside, where they nest in trees, there are sometimes few options.

It is not the first time animals have infiltrated human transport.

Last week an entire train had to be evacuated in Switzerland after a snake made its way on board during the rush hour.

All 450 passengers on the Wednesday morning service from Bern to Basel in Switzerland had to leave after a 19.5in snake was spotted in one of the carriages.

Police were called, but thankfully the black garter snake was not venomous.

Last summer, meanwhile, a three-week 
old kitten survived a 1,000-mile journey across two U.S. states - inside
 the engine of a car.

The cat was only discovered after the driver heard it meowing en route from Oregon to California.

An animal rescue charity eventually freed the kitten after up to three days by sedating it with a 'jab stick' and wiggling it out of the engine while wearing latex gloves.

It had an infected eye but was expected to make a full recovery.
