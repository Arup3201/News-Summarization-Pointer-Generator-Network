A baby bird in California has made history after becoming the world’s first penguin to be conceived using artificial insemination.

The unnamed female Magellanic penguin was hatched in May at SeaWorld California after sperm was frozen and then thawed.

The 12-week-old penguin was hand-reared at the attraction’s Penguin Encounter nursery, but is now feeding on fish.

The female Megallanic penguin (pictured) hatched in May. Although she doesn't have an official name, she is referred to as 184. She was conceived using frozen semen that had been thawed, and is now 12 weeks old

Although she doesn't have an official name, she is referred to as 184. She has now joined other Magellanic penguin chicks that were conceived naturally at the attraction.

Magellanic penguins are typically found around the Falkland Islands and South America.

They are also known as jackass penguins. 

Their name comes from the Strait of Magellan in South America.  

They grow to around 27 inches (70cm), and have an average weight of 8.8lbs (4kg).

In the wild, adults begin the breeding process in September, by building a nest, before laying an egg in mid October.

Incubation takes around 40 days.

When the chick is 30 days old, they should have developed their plumage, and are encouraged to leave the nest.

There are said to be around 1.8 million breeding pairs of Magellanic penguins around the world.

Researchers are hoping to use these artificial insemination techniques to increase the genetic diversity of penguin species, and learn more about their biology.

This research could then be used to sustain, or improve, penguin populations around the world.

After the bird hatched, she was fed a special formula of ground herring fillets, krill, minerals, vitamins and water five times a day during the first four weeks.

The scientific first is the result of a decade of research by Dr. Todd Robeck, SeaWorld’s vice President of Theriogenology, and Dr. Justine O’Brien, the reproductive centre’s Scientific Director.

Dr. Justine O’Brien said: ‘The goal of our research centre is to study a species’ reproductive biology, to learn as much as we can about that, and use this to not only monitor the health of not only our zoological populations but wild populations as well.

‘We have also use this information to develop system reproductive technologies such as artificial insemination and semen preservation.

‘These technologies are important conservation tools as they allow us to maximise the genetic diversity of these populations and ensure there’s sustainability into the long term.’

For more than 30 years, SeaWorld San Diego has run a successful penguin breeding program.

Since 1980, more than 600 penguin chicks have been hatched and raised at the marine park, including the first-ever chinstrap and emperor penguins.

SeaWorld uses both natural breeding and assisted reproductive technologies within this program to maintain genetically diverse and sustainable populations, in cooperation with other zoos.
