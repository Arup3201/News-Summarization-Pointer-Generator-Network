Bob Bashara, the Michigan businessman who ordered a hit on the hit man he allegedly hired to murder his wife, was sentenced to up to 20 years in prison Monday morning.

Bashara pleaded guilty to charges of solicitation of murder, after he admitted that he hired Steve Tibaudo, a local furniture store owner, to find someone to kill Joseph Gentz, the man who killed his wife in January.

Gentz testified that Bashara hired him to kill his wife, but authorities have yet to find enough evidence to link him directly to those allegations.

Guilty: Businessman Bob Bashara was sentenced to a maximum of 20 years for soliciting hit man to murder the man he allegedly hired to kill his wife

Emotional: In court, Bashara tearfully apologized for what he did and said that he has accepted his punishment

In court, Bashara apologized for what he did and said that he has come to accept the punishment being handed down by the court.

‘I apologize to this court,’ he said, reading from a statement. ‘I apologize to Mr Gentz. I apologize to my family and friends.’

He added: 'I certainly do not deny that it was difficult for me to come to the 
decision to plead guilty and subject myself to certain prison sentence, 
but I recognize that's what I had to do. Throughout my life, I
have tried to help those less fortunate than myself and have worked 
tirelessly and I know that I have thrown all of the respect that I build
in 40 years of helping people away.'

Bashara occasionally paused to wipe tears away from his face, and when the sentence was read to him, he shook his head. He was joined by his mother and other family members in court.

Meanwhile, Gentz told the court through his lawyer that Bashara was behind his actions and that he had threatened to kill him.

‘I have been telling the truth from the beginning,’ his lawyer read from his statement. ‘Bob has used me and threatened me. He told me he had friends in the mafia and would have me killed.’

Gentz admitted strangling Jane Bashara earlier this year but said he was doing it at the direction of her husband. Bashara denies these claims and authorities have still not been able to charge him in connection with her murder.

In July, furniture and appliance store owner Steve Tibaudo testified 
that Bashara offered him $2,000 to try and find someone to kill Gentz in the 
William Dickerson Detention Facility in Hamtramck, where he has been since March.

Confession: Bashara said, 'In June of 2012, I foolishly and 
regrettably offered to pay Steve Tibaudo to find someone to kill Joseph 
Gentz'

Strangled: Jane Bashara, left, was found dead in her Mercedes SUV on January 25 - eight miles away from their Grosse Point Park home - a day after her husband Bob, right, reported her missing

Tibaudo wore a wire and recorded their conversations for police, according to ABC.

Bashara read a statement in Wayne County Court in October admitting to the murder-for-hire plot.

'In June of 2012, I foolishly and regrettably offered to pay Steve 
Tibaudo to find someone to kill Joseph Gentz,' he said.

Jane Bashara was found on January 25 strangled in her luxury SUV, which had been dumped in an east side Detroit alley.

The lawyer for his mistress Rachel 
Gillett said the woman has gone into hiding, as she fears she could be 
Bashara's next target, according to ABC News.

Attorney Doraid Elder said: 'She was happy that he was in jail but mortified when she found out why he was in jail.'

Court: Bob Bashara, 54, of Grosse Pointe, Michigan, was charged with solicitation to murder trying to make a hit against a man he allegedly hired to kill his wife

Prosecutors said at his arraignment in June that Bashara spent two weeks trying to arrange to have Gentz killed as the handyman waited in jail court hearings on the case of Jane Bashara's death.

Worthy said at the arraignment: 'The evidence will show that Mr Bashara wanted Mr Gentz killed because he ... didn't want him to testify in any future proceedings, should there be any.'

Prosecutors also said Bashara approached a second individual to kill Gentz.

While police have long considered Bob Bashara a person of interest in his wife’s murder, he has not been charged in her death.

Gentz also faces charges of conspiracy, an indication that authorities believe more than one person was involved.

Scene: Police believe Jane was murdered in her affluent home in an upscale suburb before her body was driven to Detroit

Fear: Bashara insists he has no reason to kill his wife of 26 years and is petrified of spending his life behind bars

Since his wife’s murder, Bob Bashara has vehemently denied being involved, but Gentz tells a different story, saying Bashara promised him money and a used car if Gentz killed Mrs Bashara.

In an email to Ohio’s The News-Herald, Wayne County Prosecuting Attorney spokeswoman Maria Miller said: '[The case is] still under investigation’.

However, the paper reports that word from the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office indicate Bashara will be brought in either this week or next week to face charges.

In an appearance on Good Morning America in February, Bashara, with his daughter Jessie proclaimed his innocence in the case.

In the meantime, The News-Herald reported that Bashara has collected about 24 letters from character witnesses to use in court if he’s charged with the murder in an effort to secure a release from jail on bond.

He said: 'I did nothing wrong. I didn't commit murder. I didn't pay to have my wife killed. I'm going to see this through to the end. And I'm innocent.

'And all the badgering, and all the bad words, and all the negativity, I'm going to have to live through'.

Police again searched the Bashara's Grosse Pointe home in February and found blood in the garage - something they said they missed in their initial extensive search of the property and the surrounding area.

Arrested and charged: Joe Gentz, right, stood with his attorney Don Aubrey last month when he was charged for his role in Jane Bashara's murder

Bashara said he finds it 'fishy' that it's the first time they found it despite extensively searching the home two weeks ago.

On the day of Jane's memorial service, Gentz, a man known to the family, turned himself into police and said Bashara pointed a gun to his head and made him kill his wife, something he said he was paid $2,000 to have done.

But he told GMA he had 'no reason' to kill his wife of 26 years and that he loved her very much: 'We had a very good, open relationship. I'm frightened about this. To know that I could spend the rest of my life in jail for a crime I didn't commit is a very scary thing.'

The businessman said he came home to find his wife missing and the lights and TV left on in their home.

Bashara said he last spoke to his wife when she was driving home from work but phone records showed no such phone call took place.

The local businessman admitted he and Gentz, 48, had a dispute over a $600 bill and Bashara's attorney believes Gentz may have showed up at his home and demanded money from  Jane before getting into a struggle with her.

Deceit: Though they had been married for 26 years, Mr Bashara was said to be having a relationship with a woman who he was planning on buying a house with

Her husband told police that Gentz's version of events was absurd and said he does not even own a firearm. He told GMA the allegations are a 'sick assessment' that 'shows how deranged he is'.

'I do believe he's the one that did it. He wanted more money from me. He badgered me. And yes, I do believe he's capable of it,' Bashara said.

It has been reported that Gentz has the IQ of a third grader. He told police he turned himself in as he did not want to be wholly implicated in the crime but that Bashara was the mastermind behind it all.

Investigators also confirmed they found an 'S&M sex dungeon' in the basement of a bar Mr Bashara owned called the Hard Luck Lounge.

A Detroit dominatrix named Lady Geanna told WXYZ-TV that Bashara hosted S&M sex parties there.

She said: 'Several of my clients or slaves have called me today. Since this has come out I've had like over 20 phone calls.

'They are all people who have been to his parties and asked if I was involved with them,' she said on Friday. Some of them were worried there might have been hidden cameras, things like that'.

Sources confirmed the room was filled with whips, chains and a bed and that Mr Bashara had been drinking at the Hard Luck Lounge the night his wife was murdered.
