Chinese tourists avoid the UK because of a complicated visa system, the head of China's biggest travel agency said yesterday.

Tour operators and travelling agencies 
are deterred from bringing groups from China because entrance to 
Britain requires a separate document to the rest of the EU.

As Chinese travellers spend £65bn per year while abroad, this means British companies are potentially losing out on millions.

Yu Ning Ning, president of China International Travel Service, told The Telegraph she only brings 10,000 of her 3.23million customer base to the UK.

According to Ms Yu, Chinese tourists want to visit at least two countries while in Europe, and find it easier to apply for just a Schengen visa.

‘The UK is not a cheap visa, it’s a more expensive visa,’ she told the paper. ‘If I want to send 1,000 people, I have to send buses [to a visa processing centre].

‘This is really causing problems. Every minute you are losing business.’

Last year tourists from the booming Asian economy were named the world’s highest spending tourists, paying out £65bn while travelling abroad.

Low numbers: UK businesses are potentially losing out on millions in revenues from Chinese tourists who are more likely to stay within the Schengen area when visiting Europe

As Chinese tourists can enter most of Europe on a Schengen visa, they are less likely to go through a second process just to apply for a UK visa.

According to Financial Times report in May, France has at least 25 per cent more Chinese tourists per year than Britain.

The Home Office told the Telegraph China is one of the UK’s ‘top priorities’ in terms of attracting business and tourism, but improvements announced last year appears to have made little difference.

In 2012, only 179,000 Chinese nationals visited the UK, the lowest number of any European country.

The 1995 Schengen Agreement led to the creation of a 'borderless Europe' where those living in the 26 member countries can move freely without having to produce a passport or identification when crossing a border.

Out of all EU member states, only Ireland and the UK are outside Schengen, and new members are required to join under EU law.
