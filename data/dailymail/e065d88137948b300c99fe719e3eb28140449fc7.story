It was the rudest of awakenings.

Supposedly sound asleep and strapped to a bed, this Japanese comedian is rocketed through the roof of a shed as dawn breaks over Mount Fuji.

The elaborate joke was broadcast on a Japanese television special called Dokkiri Award (dokkiri means ‘being surprised’). If it is genuine and the 'victim' was not in on the trick, then it stands to be one of the most elaborate pranks in history.

Best prank of the year: This prank saw Japanese comedian Toshiaki Kasuga flung 50 metres into the while he was sleeping

Hold on tight: Bungee cords were attached to Kasuga's bed while he slept and he was strapped into the bed so he didn't fall out when it was launched into the air

Rude awakening: People are calling the 'Bungee Bed' prank the best prank of 2014

In a radio interview after the event, comedian Toshiaki Kasuga, claimed he was told he had to be at the base of Mt. Fuji for work early the next morning.

He arrived the night before and in order to keep warm in the freezing temperatures, headed out with the crew to get drunk.

Kasuga apparently then slept very soundly, because he claims not to have woken while a crew attached bungee cords to his bed and strapped him in it.

The next thing he knew, he said, fireworks were exploding under his bed and he was rocketed, bed and all, through the cabin’s roof 50 metres into the air.

Sweet dreams: Kasuga said he was sleeping heavily after a big night out with the crew

The comedian was told he needed to be at Mt. Fuji early in the morning so he stayed the night at this mountain cabin

Cruel or funny? Some other famous Japanese pranks have involved actors pretending to be snipers killing off people in the street and releasing robot dinosaurs into office buildings

Japanese television is famous for its expensive, elaborate, and frequently terrifying pranks played on unsuspecting members of the public for general amusement.

Previous efforts have included a fake sniper pretending to shoot everyone in the street before dragging the prank's victim into a building to tell him everyone else was acting, releasing computer-controlled robot dinosaurs into an office block, and giving a woman a teddy bear she thinks is a bomb, while everyone around her in the public square flees.

However, doubts have been raised about this latest Bungee Bed prank, as viewers have wondered exactly how drunk you need to be not to notice the two giant cranes parked on either side of your cabin.

Real or prank?: Doubts have been raised about whether this was a real prank or a set-up, with viewers finding it hard to believe that Kasuga didn't notice the cranes beside his cabin when he went to bed

Extraordinary lengths: What will Japanese TV producers come up with to top this elaborate prank in front of Mt. Fuji?
