While many two-year-olds are still learning the alphabet, the son of a Cincinnati Bengals player has mastered every word of the Star-Spangled Banner.

On Tuesday night, two-year-old Trent Harris, son of long snapper Clark Harris, stood in front of a crowd of high school basketball fans and sang the National Anthem word-for-word.

Harris brought Trent out on to the court in Manahawkin, New Jersey, before the game, handed him the microphone and stood around for a moment, making sure his son was all set.  

Trent Harris, son of Cincinnati Bengals player Clark Harris, may not be old enough to attend preschool, but the two-year-old still managed to memorize the entire National Anthem and sing it in front of a crowd of high school basketball fans

Trent confidently walked off the court, microphone in hand, once he finished his performance. The crowd erupted into applause

But he soon realized Trent, wearing a button-down shirt and blazer, didn't need any help as he confidently made his way through the song with no problems.

Trent's performance took place before a basketball game in his dad's hometown and high school gym.

Harris's wife Jessica, a choreographer and dancer, captured the moment at Southern Regional High School on video, and posted it to YouTube with the comment: 'I'm so proud!!!'.

Trent finished the anthem with no issues and walked off the court, microphone in hand, and the crowd erupted in applause.

Though Trent is only two years old, his lyrical skills surpass many kids his age - an age where many are just learning the alphabet song

Harris, who has been with the Bengals since 2009 and in the NFL since 2007, celebrated his son's accomplishment on Twitter. 

'SuperTrentendo doing his first live performance.Just a short clip of the nationalanthem to start the SRHS Bball game,' Harris wrote. 

Jessica Harris posted the YouTube clip on her Twitter, praising her son's confidence.

'So proud of my son! His first public performance and he's only 2,' she wrote. 

Jessica and Clark Harris celebrated their son's accomplishments on Twitter, by posting Tweets and re-tweeting others who had mentioned his performance
