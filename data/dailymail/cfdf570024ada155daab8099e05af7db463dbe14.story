Free healthcare could become a thing of the past if Scotland becomes an independent nation, Gordon Brown warned today.

The former Prime Minister said the whole of the UK benefits from ‘pooling resources’, and the loss of Scotland could undermine the NHS, pensions and the benefits.

Launching a Labour campaign against independence, he said he was returning to the political front line after three years ‘with time on my hands’.

The former Labour leader was launching a new campaign - United With Labour - which is the party's own drive to keep the Union together

Voters in Scotland will have their say on independence in a referendum on September 18 next year.

Mr Brown said he wanted to make the case for the ‘pooling and sharing’ of public money across the UK.

In a rare political speech since being forced from Number 10 three years ago last Saturday, Mr Brown launched United With Labour – the party’s own drive to keep Scotland in the UK.

Sources were at pains to play down the idea that the it is a rival to the cross-party Better Together campaign, fronted by Mr Brown’s former chancellor Alistair Darling.

The pair have barely spoken since leaving office, with Mr Darling accusing Mr Brown’s allies of unleashing the ‘forces of hell’ against him after comments about the scale of the economic downturn under Labour.

Today Mr Brown said he wanted to put ‘the positive, principled, forward-looking case for a strong Scottish Parliament inside a strong United Kingdom’.

He began his speech by saying that in the 'last few years I have had time on my hands, time to reflect, courtesy of the British people'.

Last Saturday, May 11, marked the third anniversary since Mr Brown was forced out of power when the Tory-Lib Dem coalition was formed.

He said he now wants to 'put the positive, principled, forward-looking case for a strong Scottish Parliament inside a strong United Kingdom'.

While some policy areas such as health and education are devolved to the Scottish parliament, Mr Brown said their funding were only possible because of the way public money is ‘pooled’ across the four nations of the UK.

He said he would not focus on the concerns about defence, security and the environmental impact of independence – pushed by the Better Together campaign.

Mr Brown said: ‘I want to make the case, the most modern case for the Union, for the pooling and sharing of resources so that we are in a position to tackle poverty, unemployment together.

‘We are in a position to fund a National Health Service based on the principle that it is free at the point of need. Therefore, I want to make the case for a Union for social justice, dominated by our principle of fairness.

‘Our UK pensions, UK national insurance, the UK minimum wage, the UK equalisation of resources , the UK children's benefits are all to the benefit not just of Scottish people but to the benefit of people all across the United Kingdom.’

Mr Brown went on to warn against a ‘race to the bottom’. On corporation tax, the former chancellor claimed if Scotland cut the rate to that of Ireland, it would lose £1.5 billion of the £3 billion raised in Scotland ‘immediately’.

He said: ‘You would lose half the share of corporation tax revenue. Then what would happen is the English would cut their corporation tax, the Welsh would demand they had the right to cut theirs, the Northern Irish already want the right to cut theirs.

‘Then there would be a race to the bottom and soon we would have very little revenue at all from corporations operating in the United Kingdom.’

This would mean less cash for pensions, for the NHS, for education ‘for the basic services we need’.

He said: ‘That race to the bottom would affect our ability to deliver the best living standards and quality of life for Scottish people.’

On pensions, he questioned whether an independent Scotland would be able to provide people with the same level of financial support in their old age as the UK does.

‘We know people have contributed their money in taxation and national insurance to a pension that has been guaranteed by the UK as a result of their contributions.

‘Would you say you were in a better position with a UK pension, guaranteed because of your national insurance contributions over the years, than with the promise but no guarantee of a Scottish administration that has already said they are setting up a working party to consider the affordability of pensions?’
