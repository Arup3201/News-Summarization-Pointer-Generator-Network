The baby orangutan who spent most of his short life trapped inside a chicken cage has met another ape for the very first time.

Budi was dying from malnutrition and too weak to move when a British  charity discovered him in Borneo.

After making a remarkable recovery, an new astonishing video shows him interacting - and playing with - an equally adorable baby orangutan called Jemmi.

They have both been raised by workers at International Animal Rescue - the charity who care for them - hope their friendship means they will become less dependent on 'human babysitters'. 

First encounter: Budi (right) - the baby orangutan who spent most of his short life trapped in a cage - has met another ape for the very first time

Playtime: Budi (top) was much more shy than his new friend Jemmi (bottom) who curiously inspected the rescued orangutan

New friends: After spending ten months caged and alone, a new video shows Budi (left) joyfully playing with another primate

Reaching out: International Animal Rescue - the charity that saved Budi (bottom) - hope his friendship with Jemmi will mean they both become less dependent on humans

Recovery: Budi (top) was too weak to even open his mouth when they discovered him inside a chicken cage in December, but he is now strong enough to swing and play 

Momentous: The charity's chief executive said the 'first meeting is a milestone in the development of both babies'

The video released by charity International Animal Rescue captures Budi and Jemmi's incredible first encounter and shows them curiously inspecting each other before exploring their surroundings.

Before Budi was rescued, his owner had never  given him a single mouthful of solid food for fear it would be bad for him - leaving his tiny limbs swollen and bent.

But the wonderful new footage shows his transformation from that frail and helpless baby into an inquisitive animal who is now strong enough to swing from trees.

He looks visibly shy when he first meets new playmate, who looks delighted to have a new friend and reaches out to touch him.

Eight-month-old Jemmi was orphaned when her mother was killed and then illegally sold as a pet.

Despite Budi's initial hesitation, it's not long before the two are climbing the hammock together and a 'bond of friendship is beginning to form between them'.

The Chief Executive of the charity that rescued Budi hopes his new-found friendship with Jemmi gets them both used to orangutans so they can hopefully be released into the wild some day.

Alan Knight said: 'As they start to form bonds with each other and then with other orangutans in baby school, they will learn from each other how to behave in the forest and gradually shed their dependence on their human babysitters.'

Rescued: Budi also had a tough start to life Budi the orangutan and was found (pictured) lying on his back in a wire chicken coop without the strength to sit up

Tragedy: This photo, taken at the time of his rescue, shows the 10-month-old with a thin blanket in his cage for comfort

Healthy: Now the baby orangutan is strong enough to support his own wait - and even swing and play

First impressions: Budi was very shy when he first met his new companion Jemmi (pictured), who confidently inspected his fellow primate

Confident: Although Budi is initially quite shy, his new friend Jemmi (pictured) curiously inspects him and coaxes him to play

Freedom: The Chief Executive of the charity that rescued Budi hopes his new-found friendship with Jemmi gets them both used to orangutans so they can hopefully be released into the wild some day

Neglect: Before Budi was rescued, his owner had never given him a single mouthful of solid food for fear it would be bad for him - leaving his tiny limbs swollen and bent

'We couldn't be happier to see how well Budi is getting on with his new playmate. This first meeting is a milestone in the development of both babies.' 

Budi was in a critical condition when International Animal Rescue found him in Indonesia in December and immediately took him to their orangutan rehabilitation centre.

At just over one year old, he should have been able to climb and swing but the helpless baby was too weak to even open his mouth.

Earlier footage showed him crying in pain when one of his carers gently turned his body or lifted him to sit up.

But thanks to intensive treatment and care from International Animal Rescue's veterinary team, he made a remarkable recovery.

Recent videos released by the charity showed Budi drinking from a bottle unaided, eating pureed food from a spoon and doing some physical therapy.

In another video he is shown fast asleep, exhausted after his physical exertions. The baby orangutan become an internet sensation after his story was first told by MailOnline.

Transformation: The change in Budi in a few short weeks is remarkable. Here he is pictured exercising at the rescue centre in Borneo

Strength: The tiny orangutan didn't have the muscle strength to open his mouth when he was first rescued from a life of neglect

Release: International Animal Rescue's chief executive said: 'They will learn from each other how to behave in the forest and gradually shed their dependence on their human babysitters'

International Animal Rescue are keen to stress that Budi's story is not an isolate case and there are 'countless' orangutans currently suffering from neglect in Indonesia.

The charity is currently caring for 83 orangutans who were being kept illegally as pets. The primates of all ages are now undergoing rehabilitation so they can eventually be released back into the wild.

Mr Knight added: 'People are being very generous in their response to Budi's story and I would urge everyone please to keep on supporting us. 

'The more people give, the more orangutans we can rescue and help on their journey back to a protected place in the forest where they belong.'
