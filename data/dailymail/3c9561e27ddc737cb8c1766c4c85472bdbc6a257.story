A man who tried to buy an airline ticket using a fake ID was fatally shot Wednesday after returning to his illegally parked car, where he lunged at an airport police officer with a knife during a confrontation, police said.

The man had multiple knives on him and suspicious items in his car that led to a bomb squad investigation, Columbus police Sgt. Rich Weiner said.

The man was identified only as a Columbus-area resident in his early 40s pending notification of his relatives.

Emergency response: A man who tried to buy an airline ticket at the Columbus airport using a fake ID was fatally shot Wednesday after returning to his illegally parked car, police said 

Incident: Police say the man lunged at an officer with a knife during a confrontation, police said.  After the first shots, the man got up and headed back toward the terminal, then a second airport officer shot him. It was unclear whether he was shot by both officers

After the first shots were fired, the man got up and headed back toward the terminal, at which point a second airport officer shot him, Weiner said. It was unclear whether he was shot by both officers. He was shot multiple times, Weiner said.

Police are investigating the man's background and why he was using a fake ID to buy a ticket. He tried at one point to use a woman's ID, Weiner said.

'At this point this is just a violent encounter between an armed man and the officers here,' the sergeant said.

Surveillance video, which was not released, will show what happened, he said.

An SUV linked to the incident was being searched for explosives by a bomb squad as a precaution, Whitaker had said. 

The incident caused delays of just over an hour during the search of the man's vehicle, when portions of the ticket lobby were cordoned off and a checkpoint to a Delta concourse was closed, said Elaine Roberts, president and chief executive officer of Columbus Regional Airport Authority.

Departing passengers who normally would be dropped off on the level where the shooting happened were redirected to a lower level.

The confrontation occurred after the officer called a tow truck for the man's vehicle, which he left illegally parked in the departures area. 

The airport and the Transportation Security Administration prohibit unauthorized vehicles in the departures area, Roberts said, adding the shooting was the first such incident in the airport's history.

'We are very pleased that we are back to a normal state for passengers,' she said.

WBNS reported that the suspect was in the ticketing lobby outside security checkpoints.

Police said there was also a call for an officer in trouble just before shots were fired. 

Speaking to the Columbus Dispatch Wednesday evening, eyewitness Jim Shriner said he saw the suspect advance on two uniformed police officers and reach for his waistband before a third plainclothes cop shot and killed him. 

Shriner, the owner of a towing business, said he was called to the airport to haul away an illegally parked car.

When he pulled up outside the departures area, Shriner said he saw a man fighting with two officers and heard two shots fired. 

The suspect went down, but then got back up and proceeded to advance on the two officers who had their guns drawn but were retreating.

The man pointed at his waistband, but Shriner said he did not see a gun there. One of the uniformed cops struck the suspect with a baton on his legs before the third officer arrived and shot him dead.  

Shriner speculated that he may have been called to the airport to tow the slain suspect's SUV from the terminal.   

Matt Diehl of Columbus was waiting to board a flight in a growing crowd. He had two hours before it took off for Philadelphia for business, but he wasn't sure if it wouldn't be delayed.

'I'm keeping my fingers crossed, but at this point I'm not optimistic,' he said.
