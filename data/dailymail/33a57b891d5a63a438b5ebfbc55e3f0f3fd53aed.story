He may have won almost every piece of silverware club football has to offer, but Edwin van der Sar showed on Saturday that he is still not above watching a game with the fans.

The former Manchester United keeper, who picked up four Premier League titles and the Champions league during his time at Old Trafford, is now back at his former club Ajax as marketing director.

But despite his high-profile position, Van der Sar still spent Saturday on the terraces for Ajax's comfortable win over Dordrecht.

The former Manchester United keeper seemed to be enjoying himself despite looking a bit out of place

Van der Sar even engaged in some banter with one fan, pushing him around during the chanting

With the score at 1-0 the cameras found the Dutch legend in amongst the crowd jumping up and down with supporters and chanting.

Despite looking a little out of place in his business suit amongst the sea of bouncing fans, Van der Sar did seem to be getting on with the supporters around him, at one point giving his neighbour a friendly nudge.

The Dutch champions, who are currently second in the Eredivisie behind PSV Eindhoven, went on to thrash relegation-threatened Dordrecht 4-0, after the visitors had been reduced to 10 men.

On the pitch Ajax eventually wrapped up a comfortable three points against lowly Dordrecht

It is not the first time the Dutch keeper has sat with fans, as this picture from the World Cup shows
