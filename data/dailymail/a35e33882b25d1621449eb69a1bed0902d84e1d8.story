A teenager, who was groomed by her married former teacher, is now pregnant with his baby.

Jeffery Thomas, 40, was banned from the teaching profession for starting a 'sexually-motivated' relationship with his sixth-form student, Lily-Mai Guard, who is now 18.

The couple are now expecting a child together and have recently moved to a home in Windsor to start a new life together.

Married design-technology teacher, Mr Thomas, was working at Haberdashers' Aske's Knights Academy, in Bromley, Kent, when he embarked on a relationship with the Year 12 student in 2013. 

Jeffery Thomas, 40, was banned by a disciplinary hearing for starting a 'sexually-motivated' relationship with Year 12 pupil Lily-Mai Guard (together above) at Haberdashers' Aske's Knights Academy, in Bromley, Kent

A disciplinary hearing report published this week revealed Miss Guard stayed at his flat one night after school on his birthday, and witnesses say they were seen kissing at least once.

It is not known when the affair first began, but witnesses say they saw them together around 10 times outside school.

And Mr Thomas and Miss Guard saw each other increasingly over the summer holidays - while he was still married - making 89 calls and texting 29 times in just one-month.

The National College for Teaching and Leadership's misconduct panel banned him from teaching indefinitely and found his 'conduct represents a fundamental abuse of his position of trust'.

The relationship between the pair continued despite Miss Guard's brother - a fellow teacher - and the school's vice principal warning him off several times.

Mr Thomas, who resigned in September 2013, accepted his conduct had breached professional boundaries but denied his behaviour was sexually motivated.

However, the report says that during a heated row, Mr Thomas told his wife – who has now moved to the US – that he had kissed the girl.

And while the panel found no evidence of a sexual relationship while the pupil was at school, they heard the pair were now living together and the teenager is expecting their first child.

The report concluded: 'The fact that Mr Thomas continued to maintain and develop the relationship with student A whilst she was a student, in the face of very clear advice and warnings as to his behaviour, is an aggravating factor in this case.

'Mr Thomas's behaviour undermines public confidence in the profession and damages its collective reputation.

In a statement Mr Thomas - known as Jeff - claimed that Miss Guard only stayed at his house once because 'she knew I was low and alone on my birthday.'

'She arrived at my flat late and unannounced,' he said.

'We went to the cinema and she ended up sleeping on the bed (me on the sofa) because she missed her last train home.'

Mr Thomas (pictured) was working at the school as a design and technology teacher when he embarked on a relationship with the student. She is now said to be expecting his baby and the pair now live together

He added that 'with hindsight' he realised it was his fault and he 'should have sent her home when she arrived.'

Miss Guard, a fan of dogs and reality shows such as Made in Chelsea, lived with her parents and six siblings before she moved to Windsor in Berkshire, with her former teacher.

The 18-year-old, who often posts light-hearted short videos of herself and friends on social media - openly states she is in a relationship with Mr Thomas on Facebook.

It is understood the couple moved to Windsor because he has family living there.

One former student wrote anonymously on social media: 'To everyone saying this is fine because he's not her teacher anymore, I think this is disgusting.

'Mr Thomas taught me and during her lessons he would always be with her and just put on a film or something for us, he was a lovely teacher, friendly, etc and I feel sick knowing he taught me.'

Another added: 'Mr Thomas WAS an excellent teacher who abused his position. To those who know him and the girl in question it is sickening. 

'I feel for the students that he taught for letting them down so badly in their exam year. It is my understanding that quite a few pupils were aware of some sort of inappropriate friendship from year 11. 

'The whole story is sad.'

Mr Thomas was working at the school when he embarked on a relationship with the Year 12 student, from Downham, Bromley, in 2013. The report from the disciplinary hearing reveals the pair exchanged phone numbers, making 89 calls and texting 29 times over a one-month period during the summer holidays

And a former pupil, who also did not want to be named, said: 'I always saw them together whilst Mr Thomas was helping her with coursework or if she had a 'free lesson'.'

'After a while I noticed they were hanging around a lot more than a normal teacher would with a student but I didn't really take notice.

'As a teacher I thought Mr Thomas was a good teacher as he was willing to help you get the grades you wanted and the ones he expected from you.

'He was a generally funny person and someone you could trust.'

A spokesman for Knights Academy said: 'We are in full agreement with the Teacher Misconduct Panel that Mr Jeff Thomas' behaviour was completely unacceptable and we fully support the banning order.

'The school took swift action as soon as it became aware that Mr Thomas had ignored all advice about his professional conduct.

This resulted in his suspension and the referral of his case to the appropriate authorities, who have now taken the decision to ban him from teaching.'

'The panel that investigated the case found that despite the school giving him 'very clear warnings', he continued to maintain and develop the relationship with Student A.'
