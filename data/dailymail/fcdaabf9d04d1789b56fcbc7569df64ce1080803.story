Faced with hundreds of bottles of wine on a supermarket shelf, how do you choose?

If you forget all about vintage and grape variety and find yourself picking up the one that looks the prettiest, you are not alone.

Almost half of women choose a wine based on its label, according to Marks & Spencer. Its study of more than 1,300 female customers found that 42 per cent were swayed by an eye-catching or attractive label.

The retailer has put the discovery to good use. It redesigned the labels on its Italian range last year and saw a significant leap in sales. One wine sold out in three months after being given a turquoise label and top.

More than 25,000 bottles of Caruso e Minini Perricone were snapped up, making it one of the fastest-selling wines that year. 

A redesigned English Pinot Noir Rose sold out in a month, and several lesser-known wines – Etna Rosso, Diantha and Ascheri Langhe Arneis – are now among M&S’s ten fastest-growing lines.

M&S winemaker Jeneve Williams said: ‘Engaging labels can make lesser-known wines more inviting and accessible, perhaps even leading to the discovery of new favourites.’

M&S has also given the back of its labels a makeover, adding more information for those who are not sure exactly what they want.

Women buy 80 per cent of the wine drunk in British homes, the survey carried out by Vinexpo found.
