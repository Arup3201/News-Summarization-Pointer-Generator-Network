Lieutenant Colonel Russell Paul, 53, tried to watch an 11-year-old girl as she changed at a public swimming pool in Plymouth last summer

A high-ranking Royal Marine could be thrown out of the Armed Forces after he was convicted of voyeurism for spying on a schoolgirl with a mirror at a public swimming pool.

Lieutenant Colonel Russell Paul, 53, watched the 11-year-old as she took off her bikini top after a swimming session last summer.

But she looked down while changing into her clothes and saw the mirror poking out from underneath the next cubicle, Plymouth Crown Court heard.

She and a friend ran to tell staff at the city's Life Centre leisure complex and CCTV footage showed Paul emerging from the neighbouring cubicle moments after the girl had fled.

Paul told police he went swimming for 45 minutes, then showered and left, but cameras showed him in the water for just seven minutes.

Officers searched his room at his base and found a bag containing 22 pairs of women's knickers, though Paul said they were a secret Santa present from seven years ago.

They also examined his home computer and found Google search terms which revealed 'an interest in young girls, teen and pre-teen', the court was told.

Llewellyn Sellick, prosecuting, said the girl spotted Paul spying on her on June 4 last year as she changed.

He said: 'She saw an eye reflected in the mirror. She covered herself with a towel and left the cubicle.'

Adrian Chaplin, defending, said Paul had a 'very good career' and wanted to 'apologise to the victims that his actions caused the upset that it did'.

Sentencing Paul,
 Recorder Simon Levene said the two young girls were left frightened by 
their ordeal and would not forget it for a long time.

The judge told Paul that 'certain members of society' such as 'marines, and judges amongst them, when they do something wrong, draw the attention not only to themselves but to their profession. That's something you're going to have to live with.'

Paul, of Taunton, Somerset, was handed a community order with three years of supervision and ordered to pay £1,600 court costs and a £60 victim surcharge.

He now faces potential consequences from his famous regiment and could be expelled from the forces over the conviction.

A Royal Navy spokesman said afterwards: 'The service will now consider the effect of his conviction on his career. Any administrative action is a private matter between employee and the employer.'
