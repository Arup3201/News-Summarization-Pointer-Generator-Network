Judy Finnigan faces calls to be sacked from Loose Women after just one appearance on the show.

The veteran broadcaster sparked fury during her debut as a panellist when she suggested a convicted rapist footballer should be allowed to return to his club because the victim was 'drunk' and the rape was 'unpleasant' but 'not violent'.

After a huge backlash about the remarks branded 'disgusting' and 'damaging', she was eventually forced to 'apologise unreservedly' for the offence she had caused.

But despite the clamour for her to leave the show, ITV told MailOnline today that she is still due to appear on the show again next week.

Left, Ched Evans was found guilty of rape in 2012 and is currently serving a five-year prison sentence and right, Judy Finnigan provoked outrage yesterday after suggesting he should be allowed back to his club, because the attack 'wasn't violent and the victim was drunk'

Judy Finnigan, right, appeared with, left to right, Ruth Langsford, Coleen Nolan, Jane Moore, on Monday's show  

A spokesperson for ITV's Loose Women said: 'She will be on the panel next week so that answers the question.'

Her comments came during a discussion on the ITV lunchtime chat show yesterday about whether disgraced footballer Ched Evans should be allowed to return to Sheffield United.

The former Wales international, 25, was jailed for five years in 2012 after raping a 19-year-old woman at a hotel near Rhyl, Denbighshire, but will be released from jail within days. 

So far his former club, which cancelled his contract, has refused to comment on whether he will be offered a new one.

But on the show, Ms Finnigan said: 'He's served his time. The rape – and I am not, please, by any means minimising any kind of rape – but the rape was not violent. He didn't cause any bodily harm to the person.

'It was unpleasant, in a hotel room, I believe, and she was – she had far too much to drink. And you know, that is reprehensible, but he has been convicted and he has served his time. 

'Now when he comes out, what are we supposed to do? Just actually refuse to let him do his job even though he has already been punished?'

Speaking on her Loose Women debut, the veteran broadcaster was discussing allowing rapist Ched Evans to return to play for his former club Sheffield United 

But before the programme had even finished, hundreds of viewers had taken to social media to express their outrage.

Emma Togwell said: 'How disgusting is Judy finnigan she needs to be sacked.' 

A Twitter user called Dave said: 'Judy finnigan is a disgrace for her comments on Ched Evans. ITV should sack her immediately.'

Steffi Rox ‏wrote: 'The only thing @loosewomen should do now is sack Judy Finnigan and never have her back on the show.'

Evans' girlfriend Natasha Massey, pictured, said she will continue to stand by him when he is released

And another added: 'If ITV do not sack Judy Finnigan after her outrageous comments that the rape was 'not violent' and 'unpleasant' then the world is messed up.'

Lucinda Hawksley said:  'Why does Judy Finnigan still have her job on Loose Women? @itv - she thinks rape isn't "bodily harm"??'

But Evans’ girlfriend has also defended the convicted rapist, saying she knows he is innocent and that she will ‘continue to stand by him’.

Speaking on ITV's This Morning today, Natasha Massey insisted she ‘knew he wasn’t capable of a crime like that’ and that the people ‘are reading a headline and not reading the facts’. 

She said: ‘I know Ched is innocent, I love him and I will continue to stand by him. I just want to get him home and live a normal life.'

While presenter Phillip Schofield pointed out that Evans had been found guilty beyond reasonable doubt, sister Kylie said: ‘That’s shocking to us. I was in court every day and I have no idea how they came to that conclusion.’ 

Today, Katie Russell, of Rape Crisis England and Wales, said Miss Finnigan's comments could cause distress to many survivors of sexual violence. 

She said: 'Judy Finnegan's comments are really unfortunate and could potentially cause some hurt and distress to the many survivors of sexual violence who will inevitably have been watching Loose Women and who will read and hear her views reported. 

'Whether intentionally or not, her words do imply that rape that involves extreme physical violence is more traumatic than rape that does not.' 

She added: 'All rape causes bodily harm and is a lot more than 'unpleasant' regardless of the circumstances in which it takes place.

'Rape is a terrifying experience that can and does have a wide ranging of long-term and even lifelong impacts for those who survive it.'  

Women's rights campaigner Jean Hatchet has set up a petition calling for Evans to be banned from football.

She told the Daily Mail she was 'stunned' by the comments, adding: 'Drunk women don't cause rape. Rapists do. 

'Evans had sex with a woman without her consent. That is a violent act. [Miss Finnigan] is guilty of such internalised misogyny that I don't think she was even aware of how hurtful and damaging her comments were.'

Last night Miss Finnigan, 66, said: 'I absolutely wasn't suggesting that rape was anything other than an horrendous crime and, as I said on the programme, I was in no way attempting to minimise the terrible ordeal that any woman suffers as a result.

'The point I was attempting to raise as part of the debate was what should happen to someone after they have committed a crime and served their time? I apologise unreservedly for any offence that I may have caused as a result of the wording I used.'

Broadcasting regulator Ofcom said it has received nine complaints about Ms Finnigan's comments. ITV said it had received no formal complaints.  

As they were: Ms Finnigan made her name as one half of Richard&Judy. The couple, who wed in 1986, worked together side by side for two decades

The South Yorkshire club has refused to comment on a possible return for Evans, who was capped 13 times for Wales before his conviction

A petition urging Sheffield United not to reinstate Ched Evans once he is released from prison has been signed by 141,173 people.

So far the club, which signed Evans for £3million in 2009, has refused to say whether it will take him back.

Women's rights campaigner Jean Hatchet set up the petition on the website Change.org, calling on the club's chairman Kevin McCabe and part-owner Prince Abdullah Bin Musa'ad Bin Abdul Aziz to make it clear that Evans – who still maintains his innocence – will not be welcome.

In an open letter to the pair, she said: 'I'm sure he and his supporters are hoping he can quietly slip back into the position of privilege he held before. Unfortunately, he still hasn't acknowledged he is a rapist as determined by a judge and jury. He will be returning, if Sheffield Utd resign him, to a position where he has huge influence over young fans.

'They must not be given the message that rape is a trivial crime. Young boys and men have to be absolutely sure that … consent to sex is essential or the act is rape.'

During the trial in 2012, Evans admitted having sex with the victim in a hotel room straight after his friend and former Port Vale defender Clayton McDonald, but denied rape.

Evans' girlfriend Natasha Massey and Professional Footballers' Association chief Gordon Taylor have backed his return. Sheffield United did not respond to a request for comment yesterday.
