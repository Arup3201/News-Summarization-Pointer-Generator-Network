Jimmy Fallon has once again turned NBC news anchor Brian Williams into a rap superstar.

The prominent news anchor and face of NBC Nightly News was the subject of another unexpected rap segment in Fallon's TV show, when he edited clips of Williams presenting the news into a well known song.

With some quick and clever editing, the team at the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon have created a montage of Williams rapping Sir Mix-a-Lot's song 'Baby Got Back'.

It isn't the first time the news 
anchor has been the subject of the TV show gag, with similar videos 
created in the past featuring Williams performing the songs 'Rapper's Delight'
 by the Sugarhill Gang and Snoop Dogg's hit 'Gin 'n' Juice'.

The latest clip, just over a minute long, was broadcast on the TV show earlier this week.

The hilarious video also features some of his co-stars, who provide some well-timed backing vocals.

Williams is a U.S. broadcaster well known for his role as anchor and managing editor of NBC Nightly News.
