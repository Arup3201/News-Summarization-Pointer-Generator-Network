The mystery behind the ‘blueberries’ on Mars may have finally been solved.

These marble-sized objects are remnants of small meteorites that broke up in the Martian atmosphere, according to scientists in Hawaii.

Researchers had previously thought that the blueberries were evidence of water flowing over the Martian surface billions of years ago.

The tiny sphericals were discovered on Mars by Nasa’s Opportunity rover a decade ago near the Endeavour Crater, and scientists have since been baffled by their origin.

‘They seem to be crunchy on the outside, and softer in the middle,’ Opportunity's principal investigator, Steve Squyres said.

‘They are different in concentration. They are different in structure. They are different in composition. They are different in distribution. So, we have a wonderful geological puzzle in front of us.’

Some scientists maintain that the research in Hawaii is overlooking key data.

Many still believe the 'blueberries' point to evidence of water on Mars billions of years ago.

They believe these iron-rich orbs, discovered at the rover's landing site in 2004, formed when the Red Planet was  warm enough to host liquid water.

In some places minerals precipitated out of the water as it diffused through rock, leaving behind hard masses. Erosion eventually exposed the blueberries embedded in outcrops..

One theory suggests that magma from volcanic eruptions, rather than water, may have formed the orbs.

However, large amounts of the iron-bearing mineral hematite have been found in these blueberries, which could suggest they formed when groundwater flowed through porous rocks.

Water flow can trigger chemical reactions that cause the iron minerals form into small sphere. But this theory doesn’t explain the narrows sizes of the blueberries.

In the journal Planetary and Space Science, scientists at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu suggest that a meteorite impact better explains the shape and composition of Martian blueberries.

‘None of the physical properties of the spherules match the concretion model,’ Anupam Misra, who led the study, told Joseph Bennington Castro at National Geographic. ‘But the meteorite theory explains all of their properties.’

The paper points to uniformity of hematite rocks on Mars. Most of the hematite rocks are about 0.16 inches (4mm) in diameter, and usually no larger than 0.24 inches (6.2mm).

The bluberries are thought to be composed of hematite. This is the mineral form of iron oxide that leaches out of the soil as ground water rises up through it

Professor Misra said these size differences can be explained if the Mars rocks came from meteor impacts.

According to the researchers, a meteorite 1.6 inches (4 cm) in diameter could scatter a thousand 0.16-inch spherules over a large area.

However, the theory has proved to be controversial, with some arguing that the conclusions don’t take into account key facts.

‘These spherules didn't form from some kind of high-temperature event, as you would expect from something melting in the Martian atmosphere,’ Timothy Glotch, a geoscientist at Stony Brook University in New York, told National Geographic.

Opportunity’s analysis of the blueberries suggests that they formed during a low temperature process, he said.
