Bafetimbi Gomis' collapse had those inside White Hart Lane holding their collective breath, with players, officials and fans fearing the worst after the Swansea striker's episode.

As play was about to resume following a fine, early Nacer Chadli volley, hush fell upon the ground where three years ago Bolton midfielder Fabrice Muamba suffered a cardiac arrest.

There was a deathly silence as paramedics and medical staff tended to Gomis, who left the White Hart Lane pitch on a stretcher and wearing an oxygen mask after several minutes of treatment.

Fortunately, good news soon emanated from the Swansea dressing room and, later in the evening, Gomis himself said he was 'feeling well' after fainting.

It was the latest episode stemming from a long-standing fainting condition and one which left Brad Friedel, on the bench three years ago and watching from the stands on Wednesday, worried a similar incident to Muamba's was unfolding.

'It went through everyone's mind,' the veteran American said. 'Anyone who was at that game probably thought the worst immediately.

'It's not normal for someone to be standing there and collapse and you know it's going to be something serious.

'But after a minute or so the word got back, so that's why you didn't see the panic on the players' faces because everyone knew he was all right.

'It was something that had to be dealt with, of course, but it was nothing in the stratosphere of what went on with Fabrice.'

Friedel's comments were echoed by Spurs winger Andros Townsend.

'It kind of brought your memory back to Fabrice Muamba,' he said. 'It didn't look good.

'When (Muamba collapsed) I wasn't here. I was on loan at Birmingham but seeing what happened with Gomis could have meant going down the same route.

'Thankfully he's okay, hopefully he can make a speedy recovery.'

As worrying as the incident was, play continued and soon after Ki Sung-yueng drew parity for Swansea.

On 17 March 2012, Fabrice Muamba collapsed on the pitch at White Hart Lane during an FA Cup quarter-final match between Bolton and Tottenham.

The former Trotters midfielder suffered a cardiac arrest and received life-saving medical treatment from Spurs staff and consultant cardiologist Dr Andrew Deaner, who was at the game as a fan, from the pitch.

Muamba was rushed to the nearby London Chest Hospital, accompanied by then manager Owen Coyle and striker Kevin Phillips, for emergency treatment while the game was abandoned.

Muamba's heart was reported to have stopped for 78minutes while the former Birmingham player received numerous defibrillator shocks on the pitch and in the ambulance.

Despite fears that he would not survive, the 26-year-old made a miraculous recovery before being discharged from hospital on April 16 - although he was forced to retire from professional football.

Ryan Mason and Townsend netted in the second half to give Spurs a lead Gylfi Sigurdsson chipped away at late on, yet Mauricio Pochettino's side ran out 3-2 victors.

It was an important result following their Europa League and Capital One Cup disappointments, especially as defeat on Wednesday would have seriously dented their top-four ambitions.

'It was the perfect response,' Townsend said in a week they have lost big games against Fiorentina and Chelsea.

'To lose a cup final and have to play a very good side three days later is always difficult, but we knew we had to go out there tonight and start fast right from the off.

'We knew we had to get the crowd on our side and lift the doom and gloom from the weekend, and I think we did that.

'We got the early goal and it set us on our way to a great win.'

The result denied Swansea a third straight Premier League win, although midfielder Jack Cork does not think the performance or result was impacted by the Gomis incident.

'I was obviously worried,' he told Press Association Sport. 'When something like that happens, you're obviously worried, but the medical staff say he is fine so hopefully it's not too bad.

'The guys said 'don't worry about it, just keep your minds on the game, he is okay' blah, blah, blah.

'Ash (Williams) was just reassuring us saying don't worry about it and we had to carry on like it hadn't happened.

'In the first half we did okay, we played some okay stuff but the second half was tough for us.

'They overloaded certain areas and made space on the wings for the full-backs.

'It was tough for us but we had to try and keep a good shape and a couple of mistakes cost us the game.'
