Diafra Sakho uploaded a photo to Twitter on Tuesday from West Ham co-owner David Sullivan's house with the pair understood to be negotiating an improved deal for the in-form striker.

Sakho's explosive start to life in the Barclays Premier League has seen other clubs, such as Liverpool, take an interest in the 24-year-old but West Ham want him to remain at Upton Park.

The £4.5million summer signing from Metz has seven Premier League goals in 10 appearances, and Sullivan was instrumental in ensuring Sakho was gambled on by manager Sam Allardyce.

The forward, currently earning a reported £15,000 per week, previously revealed his debt to the club's co-owner after his dream move to England began to fade.

'I have always wanted to play in England and when West Ham came in for me in the summer, I thought that was it,' said Sakho. 

'But then the deal began to fall through as I think the coach was having doubts and I was resigned to returning to France.

'Fortunately for me, Mr Sullivan stepped in and said he would be signing me and on a permanent deal. It was the chance I needed.

West Ham co-chairman Sullivan insisted Sakho be signed despite the club initially having doubts

'I had heard QPR didn't want me so I wanted to prove I could do it. West Ham gave me the chance and now the coach Mr Allardyce believes in me too. 

'I'm enjoying it and scoring goals against Liverpool and Manchester United shows I can play at this level. I'm just glad Mr Sullivan put his trust in me.'

Next up for West Ham, who currently sit fourth in the Premier League, is bottom-of-the-table Leicester at Upton Park.
