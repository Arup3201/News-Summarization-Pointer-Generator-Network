George Ford brought England's autumn to life with an impressive full debut as Samoa were swept aside 28-9 at Twickenham to end the 2015 World Cup hosts' five-match losing run.

Ford - making his first start at fly-half with Owen Farrell switching to inside centre - rose to the occasion superbly, kicking with intelligence, offering a threat in attack and showing surprising resilience in the face of some brutal defence from the Pacific Islanders.

The 21-year-old kicked 13 points and played a key role in setting up a try for Mike Brown in a performance that demands his selection in the climax to the QBE Series against Australia next Saturday

Sportsmail's Chris Foy rates the players' performances. 

England

Mike Brown - 6.5

Spilled pass from Ford to squander early try chance but grew into the game. One stunning take from a high kick late on.

Anthony Watson - 7

Dynamic early run on the right helped him to settle. Superb in-field burst and off-load for Brown try. An encouraging display.

Brad Barritt - 5

Warned for blocking in first half and that was arguably his most notable attacking contribution. Tackled and chased, not much else.

Owen Farrell - 6

Better. Clever inter-change with Ford for May’s first try. One or two unusual defensive lapses and fumbles but slightly more assured.

Jonny May - 7.5

Try double was just reward for explosive efforts, despite blood injuries. Showcased his blistering pace and always looking to exploit gaps.

George Ford - 8

Fine first start. Kept taking big hits and playing flat to line. Clever late passes, nimble running and fine tactical kicking. Deserves to keep shirt.

Ben Youngs - 5.5

Put under pressure at the base of scrums and rucks, and his service and kicking were mixed. No significant sniping threat

Joe Marler - 6

Made his presence felt in a dominant set piece and also put in some telling tackles but found the ball too slippery at times.

Rob Webber - 6.5

Not prominent around the field but the lineout functioned well so he delivered in his primary role and kept competing gamely.

David Wilson - 6.5

Led the early scrum assault and produced a crucial retrieval in his own 22 when England were under pressure. Solid.

Dave Attwood - 6

Another stalwart of the impressive lineout who was at the heart of England’s best driving surges. Late fumble in front of the line.

Courtney Lawes - 5.5

Not his greatest game. Was a typically reliable lineout option but no real carrying impact and some shaky handling in first half.

James Haskell - 5.5

His first act was to concede a penalty and the Wasps captain found it hard to impose himself at the breakdown or in open play. 

Ben Morgan - 5

Early run led to fumble and he didn’t carry with typical clout. Missed tackle allowed Ken Pisi to break in second half. 

Chris Robshaw (capt) - 7

Named as Man of the Match for a dogged performance at close quarters. Tackled, grafted, never eased off.

Replacements

George Kruis on for Lawes, 54. Matt Mullan for Marler, 59. Kieran Brookes for Wilson, 59. Marland Yarde for May, 61. Richard Wigglesworth for Youngs, 64. Billy Twelvetrees for Farrell, 65. Tom Wood for Haskell, 68. Dylan Hartley on for Webber, 70. 

Yarde briefly cut loose on the left during his first-half cameo as a blood replacement, but he wasted a chance for a late counter-attack try. Kruis produced a couple of strong drives. Twelvetrees charged around with great gusto and energy at the end.

Samoa

Ken Pisi 7; Alapati Leiua 6, Reynold Lee Lo 5, John Leota 5, David Lemi (capt) 6; Tusi Pisi 6 (Michael Stanley, 68), Kahn Fotuali’i 8; Sakaria Taulafo 5, Ti’i Paulo 6 (Maatulimanu Leiataua, 61), Census Johnston 5 (Anthony Perenise, 56); Teofilo Paulo 7 (Dan Leo, 52), Kane Thompson 6 (Faatiga Lemalu, 62); Maurie Fa’asavalu 7, Ofisa Treviranus 8, Jack Lam 6 (TJ Ioane, 56).
