Former Rangers, Russia and Holland manager Dick Advocaat has moved a step closer to being the next Sunderland boss

The Dutchman was heading to the north-east on Monday night for talks with the club following the sacking of Gus Poyet.

Sporting Director Lee Congerton is understood to have identified Advocaat, who stepped down as Serbia coach in November, as the man to take over until the end of the season.

Sunderland sacked Poyet in the wake of Saturday's humiliating 4-0 defeat at home to Aston Villa.

The result leaves the Black Cats one point and one place above the drop zone and owner Ellis Short believes a change of manager is needed to avoid relegation.

Poyet – who leaves after 17 months in charge – was informed of the club's decision having taken training at the Academy of Light on Monday morning.

Sportsmail reported earlier in the day that Congerton had advised Short to sack Poyet.

A statement on the club's website confirmed the news and Short said: 'I would like to thank Gus for his endeavours during his time at the club, in particular last season's 'great escape' and cup final appearance, which will live long in the memory of every Sunderland fan.
