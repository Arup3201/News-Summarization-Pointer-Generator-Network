A British paedophile who paid impoverished parents in Bulgaria £60,000 to sexually abuse their young sons has been jailed for four years.

Paul Renouf's victims were just 11-years-old and were handed over to him for weekends and holidays, a Bulgarian court heard.

The parents had increasingly relied on the divorced dad-of-three's money for food and he even bought them a house.

Jailed: Veliko Tarnovo in central Bulgaria where British paedophile Paul Renouf paid impoverished parents £60,000 to sexually abuse their two young son

Neighbours tipped off police, and officers caught the 63-year-old in a sex act with one of the boys when they raided his home in the central city of Veliko Tarnovo.

A neighbour told The Sun: 'The boys were in and out of his place constantly.

'They were there so often you would have thought they were his children.'

The eastern European country, which joined the European Union in 2007, is notorious for attracting paedophiles.

Ex-pat: Renouf, who was jailed for four years, moved to the eastern European country after serving three years in jail for sex attacks on children in the UK

Renouf, from Jersey, left Britain after serving three years of a five-year jail term for sex attacks on children in the UK.

He told the court he was in bad health and diabetic, and was ordered along with the parents, to pay the children £8,500 in compensation.

The ex-pat pleaded guilty to procuring the brothers, while the parents admitted supplying the boys for sex and were jailed for three years.

Bulgarian authorities have been cracking down on the abuse of children and have arrested other Britons, as well as Germans and Australians.
