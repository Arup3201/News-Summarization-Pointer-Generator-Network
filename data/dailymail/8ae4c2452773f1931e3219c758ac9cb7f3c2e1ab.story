They might be future rivals for the Tory leadership, but today David Cameron and Boris Johnson were at pains to show they are great mates.

Hitting the campaign trail for the the Newark by-election, the Prime Minister laughed, joked and even bought a rocky road cake for the London Mayor.

Unfortunately the unusual joint appearance outside London drew parallels with the bizarre Labour photo opportunity in 2005, when Tony Blair bought Gordon Brown an ice-cream months before being forced to say when he would hand over the keys to Number 10.

David Cameron and Boris Johnson swapped banter about baking as they toured stalls in Newark

The sight of Mr Cameron paying for cakes for his leadership rival drew parallels with the infamous moment Tony Blair bought ice-creams for Gordon Brown before the 2005 general election

Mr Blair's moment of generosity was supposed to end speculation about tensions between the two Labour figures, but he came under intense pressure to name a date for handing over power to Mr Brown

Mr Johnson and Mr Cameron spent several hours together, sharing a joke over a coffee at Newark train station

Travelling back into London on the tube, the Prime Minister caught up on the news while Mr Johnson chatted with aides

The Tory duo toured a market, pressing the flesh and posing for photographs with babies.

As they traded jokes at a bakery stall, Mr Cameron bought the London Mayor a slice of cake, telling him 'that's a gift. Rocky Road... you know you want it'.

The pair spent about 30 minutes chatting with the public in the sunshine, posing for selfies and, in the case of Mr Johnson, handing out leaflets.

They were trying to drum up support for Tory candidate Robert Jenrick in the by-election triggered by the resignation of disgraced MP Patrick Mercer.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage ruled out standing in the seat himself, but MEP Roger Helmer was selected instead. 

Mr Cameron bought Mr Johnson a £1 piece of Rocky Road from Les Flowerdew's bakery stall, which the mayor munched on as he teased the Prime Minister about his cooking skills.

'The Prime Minister bakes his own bread,' Mr Johnson said. 

Mr Cameron insisted on buying the crunchy treat, saying: 'Boris, that's a gift. Rocky Road. You know you want it.'

Mr Johnson said: 'Why don't you share some of your baking secrets.'  Apparently both men agreed the Rocky Road was excellent.

During the 2005 general election campaign, with tensions between Mr Blair and Mr Brown mounting, spin doctors contrived for them to go on a walkabout in Gillingham, Kent to prove that they were actually getting on famously.

But days after securing Labour's historic third election victory, Mr Blair faced calls to quit early into his third term and was forced from office in 2007. 

Mr Cameron indulged in the political tradition of posing with babies while on the campaign trail

Securing victory in Newark will be key to the Tory plan to prove it can see off the threat from Ukip

During a walkabout, Mr Cameron was confronted about government policy on the NHS, crime and schools

Mr Cameron insisted that the government was putting more money into key public services

But as Mr Cameron munched on his own piece of chocolate and marshmallow he was forced to defend the 20 per cent VAT rate by a more serious-minded member of the public who pressed him on whether it would be scrapped if he won the General Election. 'I cannot make that promise,' the Prime Minister said.

Earlier the duo were confronted about the state of local NHS services when he campaigned with London mayor Boris Johnson in a market ahead of the Newark by-election.

Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson mingled with shoppers and market traders in the centre of the Nottinghamshire town where the by-election is due on June 5.  

Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson are expected to be seen together a lot more in the run-up to the 2015 general election

The PM has described the London Mayor as one of his 'star players' who he wants to see on the national pitch

Local resident Brian Boby asked the Prime Minister: 'What have you done towards helping the hospital and everything closing in Newark?'

Mr Cameron said: 'What we're doing is that we're keeping the hospital in Newark. There's a lot more we can do, particularly with the ambulance service, because I know the ambulance service hasn't been good enough in recent years.'

But Mr Boby said: 'You're running the hospital down, you're running the ambulance service down, we've got a police station with no policemen - this is only time we've seen any policemen, today. You've done nothing for Newark.'

The Prime Minister said: 'We are making sure that the hospital continues in Newark. We're putting money into the health service. 

'We've got more doctors and more nurses here in the East Midlands than when I became Prime Minister.

'But I know we want to do more on the ambulance service particularly, and that's one of the things Robert (Jenrick, the Tory candidate) and I have been talking about today.'
