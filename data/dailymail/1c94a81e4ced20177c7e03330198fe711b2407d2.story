Tragic: Dan Nicholls, 23, (L) and Freddie Reynolds, 24, (R) both drowned after being swept out to sea at Brighton Pier around 1am Saturday

Mr Nicholls body was found on the beach in Rottingdean, about three and a half miles east of pier, at 8.10am today. The body of Mr Reynolds was found yesterday afternoon in Saltdean, four miles east of the pier.

A Surrey Police spokesman today confirmed what had motivated Mr Nicholls to take part in the dare.  

Detective Chief Inspector Carwyn Hughes said: 'What was a bit of fun had tragic consequences in this case.

'I urge the public, please, at this time of year especially look at the conditions. You've got to make your own risk assessment but fundamentally don't enter the see at this time of year in these conditions.'

Det. Chief Insp. Hughes said the group of seven friends, who were seeing off a friend who was about to emigrate, had discussed the dare before seeing the ferocity of the waves. The sea was a gale force nine and 'very dangerous', he said. 

Mr Reynolds family said they were immensely proud of their son for trying to save his friend. 

In a statement the family said: 'We are devastated but also extremely proud of Freddie and the bravery he showed in trying to save Dan.

'Freddie was a very loyal and brilliant friend. He was always looking out for his friends and family and people loved to be around him. He was incredibly funny and loved a joke and a banter around the dinner table.'

Mr Reynolds family said he had a variety of interests, and could often be found skateboarding at The Level, or updating his online music collection.

The statement went on to say: 'He was a brilliant partner to girlfriend Stephanie and was always showering her in cuddles. Sister Rosie describes him as a wonderful brother who was always there for her.

'He has a half brother Matthew. He had been a student at Dorothy Stringer School and was now working as a dispensary technician at Ashtons where he was popular amongst his colleagues.

'His loss will leave a huge void in a lot of people's lives. His friends and family would like to thank everyone who has been involved in the search for Freddie.'

The two men were old school friends who used to share a flat together in central Brighton.

Mr Nicholls family described him as being 'very bright, he was quick and witty with lots of friends to whom he was close and loyal'.

They added: 'He loved music which he both made and produced. Dan had a passion for cookery and in July last year prepared a culinary feast as part of his graduation celebrations.

'Dan enjoyed skateboarding at The Level in Brighton with friends and was also a Brighton & Hove Albion season ticket with his mother. Dan was a sensitive individual who had a real enthusiasm for life. He was a gentleman who always showed concern for others and was a great 'hugger'.

'Dan was bright and insightful and was a close friend of Freddie.

'Dan leaves his mother Wendy and his sister Martha. The family have received well wishes from a number of people and he was clearly well loved by many.' 

Coastguard and lifeboat teams spent Friday night looking for the men  with two all-weather lifeboats, a rescue helicopter and two shoreline rescue teams but strong winds hindered the search efforts and they were stood down.

Others in the group included a 26-year-old man from Brighton and a 23-year-old from London, officers said. They managed to get back to shore and called the coastguard, telling them their friends were missing.

An agency spokesman said: 'The conditions for searching overnight were awful - it was pitch black and the sea was extremely choppy. It was very difficult to search.

 Mr Nicholls and Mr Reynolds, both from Brighton, were old school friends who used to share a flat together, their families said

'The helicopter and the all-weather lifeboats searched the area overnight but started to stand down at about 4am. They felt they had done all they could.' 

Matt West, UK Coastguard controller, said the conditions overnight had made the search extremely difficult for those involved as the weather was currently south west eight to severe gale force nine with very high waves.  

Emma James, 24, from Brighton, drove past the scene of the search at 1am while taking a friend home and watched it unfold over the next three hours.

She said: 'There were police and rescue crews everywhere. It was pretty horrible. We just sat there for hours as we wanted them to be found.

Police and rescue teams worked last night to try and save the men who had gone into the sea off Brighton pier just after 1am 

'The sea was so rough, the lifeboats looked like they were going to tip over they were being tossed around so much.'

Emergency services were also called after an 18-year-old man was seen entering the sea in Brighton shortly before 9am.

The man, who had taken his top and shoes off before running into the water just to the east of the Palace Pier, was helped from the sea by one of three friends who was with him.

He was checked over on the beach by police and medical staff and taken to the Royal Sussex County Hospital by ambulance
