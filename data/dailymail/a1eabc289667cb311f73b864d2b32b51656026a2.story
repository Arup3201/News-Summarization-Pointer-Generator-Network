Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz apologized on Thursday for claiming the day before that Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker gives women 'the back of his hand.'

At a round-table discussion on women's issues in Milwaukee on Wednesday the Democratic Party leader had ridiculed Walker's policies toward women and drew comparison between the Republican Governor and a perpetrator of domestic violence.

After Wasserman Schultz's hyperbolic comments attracted outrage from both Republicans and Walker's Democratic opponent in Wisconsin's upcoming gubernatorial race, the DNC chair admitted in a statement that her argument could have been better phrased.

'I shouldn’t have used the words I used,' she said.

Walker is 
currently in the middle of heated re-election battle against Democratic 
candidate Mary Burke. Recent polling shows that both candidates in the November election are within one to two points of each other.

Schultz was criticizing Walker's opposition to a minimum wage increase and support for a bill that would prevent people claiming employment discrimination from seeking damages in state court, when she made the controversial about his treatment of women.

'Scott Walker has given women the back of his hand. I know that is stark. I know that is direct. I know that is reality,' she said.

'What Republican Tea Party extremists like Scott Walker are doing is they are grabbing us by the hair and pulling us back. It is not going to happen on our watch,' she added.

The Republican National Committee pounced on Schultz comments and issued a statement saying it was a 'new low for an already flailing Democratic Party'. 

'This is a sad attempt to gain political points that’s offensive to victims of abuse and well beneath the chair of a major political party,' RNC spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said in a statement.

'Mary Burke should denounce the leader of her party or explain why she’s standing by as Democrats mislead Wisconsin voters.' 

A spokesperson for Burke told FoxNews.com afterward that it was 'not the type of language' that her candidate 'would use, or has used, to point out the clear differences in this contest.'

Burke's spokeswoman, Stephanie Wilson, added that 'those disagreements can and should be pointed out respectfully.'

The DNC also put out a statement explaining that Schultz was in no way trying to make light of domestic violence.

'Domestic violence is an incredibly serious issue and the Congresswoman was by no means belittling the very real pain survivors experience,' DNC spokesman Lily Adams said.

'That's why Democrats have consistently supported the Violence Against Women Act and won’t take a lesson from the party that blocked and opposed its reauthorization.

'The fact of the matter is that Scott Walker’s policies have been bad for Wisconsin’s women.'

Wasserman Schultz said in a statement of her own on Thursday 'it's unacceptable that a majority of Congressional Republicans opposed 
this critical legislation, of which I was a proud cosponsor, after 
blocking its reauthorization for more than a year.'

While she expressed regret for the way in which she critiqued Walker's record, Wasserman Schultz stood behind the intent of her previous remarks and said they 'shouldn't detract from the broader point' she was making.

'Scott Walker’s policies have been bad for Wisconsin women, whether it's mandating ultrasounds, repealing an equal pay law, or rejecting federal funding for preventative health care, Walker's record speaks for itself,' she said.

A poll 
published in late August by Marquette University showed Walker's opponent, Burke, up two 
percentage points, while a poll taken earlier in the month by Rasmussen Reports 
found that Walker was up a single point. 

Walker is also considered a potential Republican contender in the 2016 presidential election.
