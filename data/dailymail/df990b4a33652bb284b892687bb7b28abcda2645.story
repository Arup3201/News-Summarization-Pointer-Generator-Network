Horror: Sarah Kirby fell 100 feet into the sea from the cruise ship

Kirby is suing Carnival Cruises, alleging a barman 'pushed' alcohol on her, that the ship's staff delayed her rescue and they didn't treat treat her significant injuries properly.

Danger: Kirby fell off the Carnival Destiny cruise ship while on a five-day Caribbean trip

'I remember leaning over the balcony to look at the side of the ship and next thing I knew I was in the water. Pure terror,' Kirby told ABC.

Infrared video from the deck of the boat shows her terrible tumble from her balcony on the Carnival Destiny ship after a few drinks on a five-night Caribbean cruise with her fiance and a friend. 

In the legal complaint she filed last year, Kirby claims that she became 'extremely intoxicated' after drinking Long Island Teas that a barman 'kept pushing onto the plaintiff.'

Courthouse News Service reported that the complaint stated that the bartender encouraged the group to get drunk by giving them free $5 tokens for the ship's casino the more they drank.

Kirby claims that she then returned to her cabin. The filing goes on: 'At approximately 12:10 am, the 
plaintiff stepped out to the cabin balcony to get some air.

'As she was 
holding on to the balcony's wooden banister, the plaintiff lost her grip
 and balance, slipped off the ground and fell overboard into the ocean.' Kirby struck a life raft on they way down.

Once in the water Kirby told ABC: 'I just prayed to God over and over please don't let me die out here.'

But she alleges that staff on the boat they refused to turn the vessel round to rescue her until they had conducted a 90-minute search of the ship, despite her party and other passengers reporting seeing her go overboard.

When they eventually turned round to pick her up, Kirby had been in the water for nearly two hours without a life jacket and had believed that 'death was imminent' from drowning or shark attack.

According to Courthouse News Service the complaint states that 'rather than treating her severe 
injuries, the Carnival doctors' treatment of the plaintiff was primarily
 limited to giving her pain medication.'

Kirby reportedly had: 'fractured orbital bones, lung contusions,
 hypothermia, fractured ribs, dissection of the carotid artery, heart 
arrhythmia, broken optical shelves, blood clots in her eyes, arms, and 
legs, as well as extreme hematomas all over her body.'

Legal challenge: Kirby was rescued after nearly two hours floating in the sea but received serious injuries. She is suing Carnival Cruises for negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress

The woman states that the cruise was diverted to Key West, instead of her being airlifted to Miami.

Kirby is suing for damages for negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

In a statement to ABC, Carnival Cruises said that these claims are 'are completely unsupported and contradicted by the evidence in the case.'
