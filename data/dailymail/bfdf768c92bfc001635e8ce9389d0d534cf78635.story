A Romanian man was caught shoplifting twice after being in the UK for just three days. 

Andrei Alexandru Burnei was caught stealing just hours after he arrived in the country on March 9 and was arrested in Coventry.

The 21-year-old was held overnight and released - but two days later he was caught trying to steal £1,127 worth of vodka from Asda in Blackburn, hiding dozens of bottles beneath cheaper items in his trolley.

Andrei Alexandru Brunei was caught stealing £1,000 worth of vodka from Asda in Coventry - just three days after he arrived in the UK from Romania in a bid to look for work which had proved unsuccessful 

Blackburn Magistrates' Court heard that Burnei, of Coventry, had come to the UK in hope of finding work but this had not materialised.

On March 12 he was stopped as he left Asda in Blackburn because a security guard had become suspicious of him when he failed to make any eye contact.

Burnei ran off but was eventually cornered and detained.

His trolley was searched and found to be loaded with premium vodka, concealed beneath cheaper items from the store.

Karen Saffman prosecuting, said: 'The value of his trolley load was extremely high.' 

At the hearing Burnei pleaded guilty to stealing the alcohol from Asda and was ordered to do 60 hours' unpaid work and pay a £60 victim surcharge. 

The incident comes after Ionut Tudorache, 25, was jailed for nine months earlier this month. The Romanian pickpocket was caught working as part of an organised gang, stealing mobile phones from people at a Kasabian gig at Bournemouth's International Centre.

Tudorache, who had been in the UK just a few days, was caught stashing 22 stolen mobile phones down a pair of tights he was wearing beneath his trousers. He claimed two Romanian men he had met had started stuffing the phones down his tights and he had no idea they were stolen.

At a hearing at Blackburn Magistrates' Court Brunei was sentenced to 60 hours unpaid work for the theft 

He was jailed for nine months.

Like Tudorache, Brunei is unlikely to be deported due to strict laws on removing EU citizens.

Peter Bone, 62, Conservative MP for Wellingborough said: 'This is outrageous.

'Only a few weeks ago I introduced a bill to Parliament that would have dealt with this very situation. I have been calling for foreign criminals to be sent back to their respective countries immediately - with no opportunity for them to return and commit further offences.

'It's my view that if someone comes into Britain and breaks the law, they have abused our hospitality and should be sent home and not be allowed to come in again.'  

Without a court recommendation or tougher prison sentence, he can now only be removed at the behest of the Home Secretary.

Scotland Yard recently claimed it had identified a trend in which eastern Europeans were being trafficked into the UK and forced to carry out upmarket shoplifting before returning home on budget airline flights. The gangs accept a 20 per cent arrest rate as the cost of a 'weekend trafficking' operation that can secure items worth up to £100,000 that are taken out of the country for resale.
