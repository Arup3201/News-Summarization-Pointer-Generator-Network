Meat from British horses has been passed off as beefburgers served in schools and fast food outlets across the country, the Daily Mail can reveal.

Many of the products, which were made by the award-winning Burger Manufacturing Company(BMC), in Builth Wells, Wales, have been eaten.

The firm’s suspect burgers were on the menu in some 43 primary and secondary schools in Caerphilly, in Wales.

Raided: Farmbox Meats processing plant taken from inside the estate where the horsemeat came from

BMC is also one of the biggest suppliers to independent fast food outlets in the country as well as producing gourmet burgers for restaurants, cafes and hotels.

The company bought the meat from Farmbox Meats, which is also in Wales and was raided two weeks ago by the police and officials from the Food Standards Agency(FSA).

It is understood the meat came from horses slaughtered by Peter Boddy, who operates an abattoir on a property near Todmorden, West Yorkshire.

Mr Boddy and two people from Farmbox, including the owner Dafydd Raw-Rees, have been arrested and interviewed in connection with allegations of food fraud.

Tests carried out by officials from Powys County Council found horsemeat in three burger samples taken from BMC’s factory in the last two weeks.

The level of horsemeat will be revealed, however it could be anything between 1per cent and 100per cent.

BMC, which admits buying meat from Farmbox, describes itself as on a mission to ‘change the reputation and image of the humble burger’.

It has a partnership with Sparks Catering Butchers, based in London, which supplies hundreds of fast food outlets, including kebab shops, in south east England and beyond.

However, BMC, which also makes gourmet burgers, said:  ‘We also supply all conceivable types of café, restaurant, hotel and leisure outlet with a huge selection of steak burgers.’

The company claims to only use the finest cuts of UK and Irish Farm Assured beef, while its upmarket products include Aberdeen Angus burgers.

Its website boasts of many accolades for its high standards and ethics, while it claims to have taken manufacturing burgers to ‘craft level’.

The firm was given a silver award in ‘The True Taste of Wales’ for its distinctive and upmarket Kobe burger.

Mislabeled: Frambox Meats provided The Burger Manufacturing Company with their meat and they were raided two weeks

It adds: ‘Every burger that our company produces has a distinctive taste profile that is consistent and unequalled within the burger manufacturing industry.’

The FSA said: ‘Three samples of beef burger products made by catering supplier, The Burger Manufacturing Company (BMC), have tested positive for at least one per cent horse meat.

‘Further work is being carried out to establish exactly how much horse meat these products contain and to test for the presence of the veterinary medicine phenylbutazone, or bute.’

 'Testing
carried out by Powys County Council, as requested by the FSA, has shown
that three samples of beef burger products made by catering supplier, 
The Burger Manufacturing Company (BMC), have tested positive for at 
least 1% horse meat,.

'Further
work is being carried out to establish exactly how much horse meat 
these products contain and to test for the presence of the veterinary 
medicine phenylbutazone, or bute.

'In line with good practice, BMC is withdrawing these products. 
The company is also contacting its customers to inform them of the 
results of these tests and to withdraw any of the affected products that
they may have.'

BMC states on its website that taste tests among children have found the firm’s burgers are extremely popular.

The firm has a contract with the major catering firm, Holdsworth, to supply burgers to 43 primary and secondary schools in Caerphilly.

Holdsworth said it was told about the problem of horsemeat contamination on Tuesday and ordered a recall of any burgers that have not been eaten. The firm said it had previously been given a written assurance by BMC that all its beef came from approved sources.

Last week, schools in Lancashire withdrew cottage pies after traces of horsemeat were found, while councils in other areas have removed beef from menus as a precautionary measure.

John Sparks, a director of BMC and its
London distributor, said it bought meat from Farmbox because it wanted 
to support a local business.

It
purchased a consignment of seven tonnes of meat from Farmbox, which was
thought to be beef, but appears to have been partly or entirely horse.

Mr
Sparks said: ‘We bought the meat from Farmbox, it was labelled as beef.
It would never have occurred to me to put anything in beefburgers other
than beef.’

He added: ‘We pride ourselves on using quality meat from, where possible, locally sourced suppliers. 

‘Our
decision to use Farmbox Meats Ltd was to help boost local businesses, 
and because of our belief in the quality of their meat.  It is 
disappointing that on this occasion the high standards we expect have 
not been met.’

The FSA will
reveal the latest tranche of test results on beef products for the 
presence of horsemeat. Any new examples are expected to come from 
catering firms.
