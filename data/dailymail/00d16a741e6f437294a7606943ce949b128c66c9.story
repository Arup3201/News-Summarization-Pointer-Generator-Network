A new television show from the producers of the controversial Benefits Street could be in the making after a camera crew were spotted filming residents and ‘exploring the subject of immigration’.

Film crews approached people in a residential street in Southampton, Hampshire, and told locals they were filming a documentary for a potential new series called ‘Immigration Street’.

The show, filmed by Love Productions - 
which also made Benefits Street - is set to focus on how people living 
in different ethnic groups live in close proximity to each other and 
could air on Channel 4 next year.

Although the programme is only in the development stage at the moment, if it is commissioned for a full series it is set to be filmed over the summer.

Film crews have been spending time in the 'vibrant and diverse' Derby Road area of Southampton and have interviewed residents and locals for the show.

However, the presence of the cameras has caused alarm to some residents and local figures who fear the road will be portrayed negatively.

Southampton Test MP Alan Whitehead, who represents the area, said: ‘Derby Road is a very vibrant, diverse and strong working part of Southampton.

‘It is a community which has been there for a very long time, pretty much everyone there was born in Southampton.

‘It seems quite extraordinary that a company wants to come and brand an area with a particular name they have decided in advance.’

The MP fears the show will result in Derby Road being portrayed in the same negative light as James Turner Street, Birmingham, in controversial show Benefits Street.

A Channel 4 spokesman said: 'Love Productions are researching a potential new series for Channel 4 looking at life in a community where diverse groups of people live alongside one another'

He added: ‘I do fear, with their track record, this is not going to be a show which actually points out all of the good things that are going on the area.

‘Yes, it is a culturally diverse area of the city, but the idea that one particular street is "an immigrant street" doesn't seem accurate.

‘We saw this with Benefits Street. Some people on the show had no idea certain things were going to be said or shown on the show.

‘It produced a picture which they did not recognise and it distorted substantially what those people in Birmingham wanted to say.’

After learning about the possibility of the show coming to Southampton, Mr Whitehead wrote a letter to Derby Road's residents.

He also said he had heard rumours film crews may have offered enticements for people to appear in the show, something the producers refute.

Mr Whitehead added: ‘I have written to everybody who lives in Derby Road and asked them what they think about it all.

‘The way a number of people on the street may have been approached is giving cause for alarm, if it is true.

‘They allegedly approached people and offered to do their washing or take them out for meals, provided they do certain things in certain ways.

Southampton Test MP Alan Whitehead fears the show will result in Derby Road being portrayed in the same negative light as James Turner Street, Birmingham, in controversial show Benefits Street

Deirdre Kelly,  known as 'White Dee' has become one of the most famous characters portrayed in Channel 4's Benefits Street

Benefits Street focused on the 
residents of James Turner Street in Winson Green, Birmingham, where it 
was reported that more than 90 per cent of residents lived on benefits.

Screened
 over five episodes starting in January, it was controversial with 
politicians and the police and resulted in hundreds of complaints.

It made household names of residents such as White Dee, the self-styled ‘mother’ of the street.

Early
 episodes featured residents of the street confessing to cameras that 
they had fraudulently claimed benefits, and at one point cameras even 
followed a man around central Birmingham on a shop-lifting spree. Police
 investigations were launched after the footage was aired.

The series generated around 960 complaints to Ofcom and another 800 to Channel 4.Benefits Street is the channel’s biggest ratings hit since its coverage of the Paralympics in 2012.

Channel
 4 and programme makers Love Productions claim the street is typical of 
hundreds of UK communities struggling to cope with economic and social 
decline.

But some critics labelled it ‘poverty porn’ and said it is paints a false picture of life in modern Britain.

Others
 praised it for exposing the truth of benefits fraud but said it failed 
to condemn crime and also exploits children, exposing them to bullying 
and victimisations.

Some 
residents said the show - which shows children swearing and misbehaving -
 has left youngsters to ashamed and embarrassed to go to school.

‘If that were true, and it has come to me second and third hand, it would suggest the programme would be set up in a way to run to a script.

‘Therefore it won't reflect what is happening in the area, and that is very alarming.

‘But this is more serious - this is about a real street, a real community, a real city and things which are really happening.

‘I think there is an absolute responsibility on anybody who is making such a programme to get it right and start off right.’

Producers say they have not yet finalised a name for the new series but admitted 'Immigration Street' has been discussed and is a possibility.

A Channel 4 spokesman said: ‘Love Productions are researching a potential new series for Channel 4 looking at life in a community where diverse groups of people live alongside one another.

‘The title and location are not yet confirmed and discussions are ongoing with local people.

‘Benefits Street sparked an important debate about the welfare system.

‘It was a fair and balanced observational documentary series and was a sympathetic, humane and objective portrayal of how people are coping with continuing austerity and cuts in benefits.

‘We strongly refute any suggestion that any resident of Derby Road has been offered bribes or gifts on condition of filming them.

Khalid Farooq, of the Derby Road-based Pakistan Welfare Association said the TV show was an opportunity to show how multi-cultural the street is

Kieran Smith, creative director at Love Productions, said Derby Road in Southampton was the current focus for the show due to the number of immigrants living there

‘Any filming the team have done would follow strict protocols in accordance with the Ofcom Broadcasting Code.’

Cleaner Delroy Campbell, who flies Jamaican flags from his home in Derby Road, has already been filmed by the crew.

The 56-year-old said: ‘I've done a lot of filming with them already, I don't have a problem with it.

‘I'm a hard-working man and I've lived here for three years, I used to live over the road before that.

‘I don't know how it will end up, but I don't think I've put myself in any danger.’

Hasan Hourani, 21, a student living in Derby Road said he finds it offensive that families on the street have been asked to appear in the show.

He said: "’I find it offensive to the families that live here.

‘Maybe it was a bad area ages ago, but now all I see is good and normal people from different countries around the world.’

However Khalid Farooq, of the Derby Road-based Pakistan Welfare Association said it was an opportunity to show how multi-cultural the street is.

He said: ‘I think it's good. It shows the multi-cultural environment of people living in Derby Road.‘They should show a positive aspect of the community and show how hard working people are here.’

Councillor
 Satvir Kaur, Southampton City Council cabinet member for communities, 
said: ‘I do have concerns about a potential programme called Immigration
 Street.

Southampton residents fear 'Immigration Street' could portray them negatively and attract attention like Benefits Street did to the residents of James Turner Steet in Birmingham, including Dee Roberts, pictured

‘We have a variety of diverse communities in Southampton and community cohesion is something we should pride ourselves on.

‘My concern is it will not show that, and I am genuinely worried about vulnerable people in that area in Derby Road.

‘Some people could be taken advantage of as they will not realise how the final edit will portray them.’

Kieran Smith, creative director at Love Productions, said
the idea for ‘Immigration Street’ came about during the filming of Benefits
Street.

He said: ‘It came about as a result of the second episode of
Benefits Street where we featured one house which changed hands several times
and was mainly occupied my immigrants.

‘It was described as one of the most sensitively-handled pieces on
immigration at the time and we felt it was worth doing a series.

‘The idea of
immigrants being in Britain and how they get by when they’re here and the
effect they have on communities felt like something that was useful for us to
do.’

Mr Smith said the crew were currently meeting people and
looking into various locations although Derby Road was the current focus.

Film crews spent 12 months filming residents in James Turner Street, Birmingham, pictured, for the controversial series Benefits Street

He said: ‘It’s an area which we researched and we knew from the Office of National Statistics has large number of immigrants settling there.

‘It felt like a place that was going to be interesting place and had interesting characters living quite diverse lives.

‘Of course you’re going to get some people that say they don’t want to be involved but there’s lots of people who are happy to be filmed.

‘Like all documentary series you have to be respectful because people are naturally nervous.

‘We are run by very strict guidelines on how we operate. We don’t pay people, we don’t bribe people – these things simply don’t happen. We’re not in the business of stitching people up.

'It’s about showing a fair, honest, truthful account of showing what happens in a street over a certain period.’
