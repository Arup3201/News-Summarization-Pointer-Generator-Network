Lucky: Debbie McKnight was trapped under her car for three days

A grandmother miraculously survived being trapped under her car for three days after crashing her vehicle in a ditch on Christmas day.

Debbie McKnight had been visiting her family and was driving home to Tumut in New South Wales, Australia, when her car veered from the road after she reportedly swerved to avoid a kangaroo.

The 45-year-old's vehicle rolled 15 metres down into an embankment and onto its roof, trapping her left leg which eventually had to be amputated by medics who rescued her.

Mrs McKnight was trapped in her 
Commodore car for 72 hours in the ditch in Batlow, southern New South 
Wales, before she was finally spotted.

A teenage boy heard her cries for help and comforted the woman by talking to her before calling the emergency services.

Caleb Wilks has since been praised for his quick thinking and actions in helping save Mrs McKnight.

Police said that if the weather had been more typically hot for the time of year, she may not have survived.

Acting Sergeant Roy Elmes said the car
could not be seen from the road and the woman's cries could not be 
heard by passing motorists.

He said: 'It's quite astounding that she was found. She is very, very, lucky.

Rescue: Emergency services were eventually alerted to the woman after three days when she was spotted by a passing teenager

'I'm sure she would have been quite relieved to have someone who just happened to be walking past who heard her cries and found her.'

'The weather's been a bit cooler and we've had some rain - otherwise I think it could have been different circumstances.'

Mrs McKnight was flown to hospital in Canberra after being discovered, where her crushed left leg had to be amputated.

John Larter, manager of Tumut ambulance station, said: 'As anyone would be in a vehicle lying upside down for three days over Christmas I imagine she would have been distressed.

'You'd be missing your family over Christmas and I suppose you'd be wondering when somebody was going to come and rescue you. Â 

'It obviously just kept getting longer and longer and nobody was coming.'

'Considering what had happened and the length of time she'd been there, she was in a remarkably good condition.

'It
was a surprise to us to find out that she'd been there for that long. 
It was also a surprise to see that she was in such good spirits.'

Sergeant Brian Hammond said teenager Caleb called the emergency services after finding the woman and then he waited at the road so that police could find him.

Segeant Hammond said: 'Otherwise we wouldn't have found the car. He's been very mature.

'His parents are very proud of him - and she's been very lucky that he walked by.'
