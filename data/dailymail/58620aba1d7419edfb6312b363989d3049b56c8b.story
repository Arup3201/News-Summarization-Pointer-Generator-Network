Thousands of people gathered  today to witness the brutal execution of two pigs which were chopped in half so villagers could dip their money in the blood as part of a good luck ceremony.

Each year residents of Nem Thuong village in Bac Ninh province, Vietnam, hack two pigs in half with ceremonial machetes in a ritual they believe will bring them good luck and fortune in the coming year.

But many people in the country, where animal rights are a newly emerging concept, are becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the annual 'pig slaughtering' festival.

During the bloody ritual the pigs are held down with ropes and sliced in half across the belly with swords as part of Lunar New Year celebrations.

Vietnam's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism had called on villagers to tone down the more bloody aspects of the ritual sacrifice.

Local officials in Bac Ninh province also urged villagers to change it to a 'pig-parading festival' following criticism from animal rights groups and local media.

Those pleas fell on deaf ears today as two pigs were paraded around the village to the sound of beating drums and horns before being tied down and hacked in half with machetes to cheers from the crowd.

The popular event is increasingly coming under fire from the growing animal rights movement in Vietnam

Nguyen Dinh Loi, from Nem Thuong's old people's association, said: 'The older generations here say it is the village's choice, that the pig slaughtering does not violate the law and must be decided by the villagers themselves. 

'We want to keep the traditions of our ancestors.'

After the animals were slaughtered, villagers dipped bank notes into pools of blood in the belief that doing so will ensure good luck and fortune for the new year.

Animals Asia Foundation, which campaigns against the tradition and other animal cruelty issues, says this year's festival was preceded by increasingly disapproving commentary in Vietnam's tightly controlled media and on social networks.

'We are seeing a broad condemnation of cruelty from Vietnam's people and increasingly from politicians too,' Tuan Bendixsen, the group's Vietnam director, said.

'Those who act in defiance of that consensus do so using culture as an excuse, and a lack of animal cruelty laws has fuelled this further.'

Nem Thuong's pig slaughtering ceremony has taken place for centuries on the sixth day of the first month of the new lunar year.

Locals and historians say the festival commemorates the 13th century anti-imperial general Doan Thuong, who is regarded as the village's guardian deity.
