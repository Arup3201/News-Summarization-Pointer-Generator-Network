Ailing: Hosni Mubarak lies on a bed in a steel cage inside the court room in Cairo as he faces charges of corruption and ordering the deaths of protesters

Six months ago he ruled Egypt with absolute power.

Yesterday Hosni Mubarak was in a cage, wheeled into court on a hospital trolley, broken and humiliated, to face an extraordinary show trial.

The 83-year-old, who is said to have stomach cancer, denied charges of corruption and complicity in the killing of protesters.

Beside him at a Cairo police academy converted into a court for the trial stood his two sons, their hair cropped and wearing white prison uniforms which matched their father’s.

It was the first time Egyptians have seen Mubarak, who has been under hospital arrest in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, since he gave a defiant TV address refusing to resign before he was forced from office in February.

They watched him live on state TV yesterday, many savouring the downfall of the man who ruled them, often brutally, with unquestioned power for 29 years.

There had been widespread scepticism that Egypt’s new military rulers would ever allow Mubarak to stand trial – one of the key demands which has united protesters since he fell following an 18-day uprising.

‘This is the dream of Egyptians, to see him like this, humiliated like he humiliated them for the last 30 years,’ said Ghada Ali, the mother of a 17-year-old girl in the city of Alexandria who was shot dead during the crackdown.

‘I want to see their hearts explode like my daughter’s heart exploded from their single bullet,’ she sobbed.

In the courtroom protected by 3,000 soldiers and police, a prosecutor read the charges against Mubarak – that he was an accomplice along with his then-interior minister in the ‘intentional and premeditated murder of peaceful protesters’ – and that he and his sons received gifts from a prominent businessman in return for guaranteeing him a lowered price in a land deal with the state.

Repercussions: The former leader, who held power for nearly 30 years, has not been seen since he was deposed in February

Unprecedented: Security is extremely tight at the trial in Cairo, with steps taken to prevent missiles being thrown into the cage

Caged: Mubarak can be seen in his bed on the left of the image, flanked by his two sons Gamal and Alaa

Court appearance: Mubarak was flown by helicopter from Sharm el-Sheikh yesterday morning

‘Yes, I am here,’ Mubarak said softly from his bed, raising his hand slightly when the judge asked him to identify himself and enter a plea.

‘I deny all these accusations completely,’ he said into a microphone, wagging his finger.

The charge of ordering the killing of protesters – 850 died during the uprising –  carries the death penalty.

Although pale, his eyes ringed with red, the man who survived several assassination attempts to become the region’s power broker appeared alert and aware of what was going on.  He showed little discernible emotion, occasionally pulling a white sheet up to his chin.

Flanking him in the cage were his nine co-defendants. As well as his sons – one-time heir apparent Gamal and wealthy businessman Alaa – his former interior minister Habib el-Adly and six top former police officials are accused.

Highly anticipated: Mubarak abiout to be led from a van outside the court. He faces charges of corruption and ordering the killing of protesters during the uprising in February

Clashes: Pro and anti-Mubarak supporters were involved in scuffles outside the courtroom

Unrest: Pro-Mubarak supporters have threatened to burn down any prison the former leader is put in

Jubilant: A protester against Egypt's former President Hosni Mubarak holds a flag and flicks a V for victory hand gesture outside the police academy where the trial is taking place

From time to time, Mubarak craned his neck to see the proceedings and at other times, he crooked his elbow over his face as if in exhaustion.

While the other defendants sat on wooden benches in the cage, Gamal and Alaa stood next to their father’s bed, at one point with their arms crossed on their chest seemingly trying to block the court camera’s view of their father.

The two sons each carried a copy of the Koran and leaned over to talk to their father.

Emotions were high outside the court where a crowd of Mubarak supporters and hundreds of relatives of dead protesters and other Mubarak opponents massed at the gates, scuffling sporadically as they watched the proceedings on a giant screen.

Divisions: An Egyptian man loyal to the former president throws a stone at a foe outside the police academy where the trial is taking place

Fighting: Supporters Mubarak clash with an anti-Mubarak protester, centre, outside the court room during the first day of the former president's trial

Emotions running high: The clash continues between pro- and anti-Mubarak demonstrators with the men wielding makeshift weapons

The pain is not yet over: An injured man is carried away during clashes between supporters of Egypt's ousted President Hosni Mubarak and anti-Mubarak protesters

Scores to settle: Unidentified protesters throw rocks as they clash with others, as one holds a photograph, right, of a man killed during the uprising in February

They threw stones and bottles at each other while riot police with shields and helmets tried to keep them apart.

Fifty supporters pounded on the steel gate trying to get into the compound, chanting ‘We love you, Mubarak!’ until police charged at them with electrified batons and dispersed them.

The courtroom itself was divided. Relatives of the defendants sat near the cage. A fence running through the middle of the chamber divided them from the rest of the audience of around 300 people, including a few relatives of protesters killed in the uprising, kept far enough that they cannot shout or throw anything at the former leader.

The trial was adjourned until August 15. Mubarak will be held  at a military hospital on the outskirts of Cairo.

Flashback: Mubarak was ousted from power after 18 days of violent protests centred around Tahrir Square, in Cairo, as well as other cities

Public anger: A man walks past a defaced statue of the former leader. Mubarak has been in Sharm el-Sheikh since he was deposed in February

Backlash: Hundreds of protesters were killed during violent clashes in February, but eventually Mubarak was forced to stand down as thousands descended on his palace
