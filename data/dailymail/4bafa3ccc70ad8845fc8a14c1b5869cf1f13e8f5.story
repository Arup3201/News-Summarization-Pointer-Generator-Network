Kendall Jenner has made her third appearance in American Vogue, modeling a collection of cropped jackets, which are predicted to be one of next season's must-have fashion items, for the magazine's January issue. 

The 19-year-old model, who is currently in California preparing to celebrate the holidays with the rest of the Kardashian clan, looks like the ultimate professional as she showcases the high-end designs from big-name labels such as Givenchy and Burberry Prorsum.  

It is the second time in as many months that the reality star has appeared in the US edition of the fashion bible; in December, Kendall also sat down for an in-depth interview with the publication, revealing details about her 'competitive' upbringing in the Kardashian household.

Fashion favorite: Kendall Jenner makes her third appearance in US Vogue this month, modeling a collection of cropped jackets including this $1,295 Edun design

Perfectionist: In the December issue of the magazine, the 19-year-old confessed that she is incredibly competitive when it comes to her career

'I learned early that being a perfectionist and providing quality was the only way to do business,' she told reporter Emma Elwick-Bates. 

'Workaholic is a good word in our house.'

This time around, Kendall allows the photos do the talking as she poses up a storm in the 10-strong selection of images, which appear to have been shot on a desert-based location. 

Kendall's appearance in Vogue rounds off an incredibly successful year for the young model, who was last week named as social media site Tumblr's most popular model for 2014.

And in addition to being shown some serious love by Vogue's Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour, during the past 12 months, Kendall has appeared on numerous catwalks during Paris, New York and Milan Fashion Weeks, modeling for the likes of Balmain, Dolce & Gabbana, Bottega Veneta, Pucci, Fendi and Chanel.

Earlier this month, just weeks after being revealed as the newest face of Estee Lauder, she reportedly turned down the opportunity to model in the hotly-anticipated Victoria's Secret fashion show in London. 

No rest for the wicked: Although Kendall is currently at home for the holidays, she clearly can't stop working, sharing this photograph of herself and make-up artists Rob Scheppy and Joyce Bonelli on a shoot

Instead, Kendall joined fellow model - and close friend - Cara Delevingne in Salzburg, Austria, where the duo walked in Chanel's Métiers d'Art Show.

And while the young model is currently at home in California for the holidays, she hasn't let that slow her down, posting a picture of herself on a shoot earlier today alongside celebrity make-up artists Joyce Bonelli and Rob Scheppy. 

Indeed, if she carries on the way she has for the past 18 months, Kendall looks set to achieve even more success in 2015 - something she isn't afraid to embrace.  

'I would always be looking at these supermodels, they were just so amazing, they were like superheroes,' she told Nightline earlier this year. 

'I want to be some little girl's superhero. I want to be the best role model I can be to a little girl or a little boy or to anybody.'
