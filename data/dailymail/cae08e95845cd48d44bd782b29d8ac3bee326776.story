When the Queen ascended to the throne in 1952, the latest thing in ship design was the Orient Line's Oronsay, a 1,500-passenger vessel built by Vickers-Armstrong at its yard in Barrow-in-Furness.

The excellent P&O Heritage website offers fascinating glimpses of life on board - all tea dances and cucumber sandwiches.

What a change there is today.

You feel that the latest P&O vessel Britannia, which the Queen officially named last Monday in Southampton, could fit the Oronsay on to one deck.

However, they are not just vessels from different eras - they come from wholly dissimilar philosophies. 

Oronsay was built primarily to get passengers from Tilbury to Sydney - fun was considered to be a fancy dress party or the odd beetle drive.

Britannia has been purposefully built for enjoyment. 

It is an entertainment monster, bristling with fun on almost every deck. It is, to borrow a line from poetry, a stately pleasure dome.

It's customary to bemoan the compromised standards of the modern era, to yearn for the sturdier certainties of times past. Cruising, at least, is one area where newer almost always means better.

P&O Cruises may be part of the American Carnival corporation these days but, happily, it remains British to the tips of its mastheads. 

The bow of Britannia carries a huge stylised Union Jack, which serves not merely as a clever national marketing device, but broadcasts a British heritage which has been brought bang up to date.

The ambassadors for modern P&O Cruises are chefs such as Marco Pierre White, Atul Kochar and James Martin because it is in the area of food, strangely enough, in which the UK has begun to lead the world.

Another area where we set the standard is in hotels: the international success of Nick Jones and his Soho House group has ushered in a new era of laid-back elegance. 

It is this very style that Britannia has captured so impressively. 

The modern era of British cruising, which P&O Cruises began with the Oriana more than 20 years ago, has now achieved an apotheosis with Britannia.

For those poor holiday limpets who will not consider cruising because they refuse to acknowledge the emergence of what is arguably the purest form of holidaymaking, I have one piece of advice: be ruled by Britannia because Britannia really does rule the waves.
