The teenage boy at the center of the Louisiana school threesome scandal is devastated that his bragging has ruined the promising careers of two teachers.

'He is really down about it right now,' the high school junior's grandfather told MailOnline in an exclusive interview. 'All boys that age want to brag about what they are doing. He didn't expect it would come to this.'

The teachers, Rachel Respess, 24, and married mom-of-three Shelley Dufresne, 32, are currently out on bond awaiting trial for having sex with their student. They are on unpaid leave from their jobs at Destrehan High School and are unlikely ever to return.

'He feels really bad,' said the boy's grandfather. 'These women have families and he knows how terrible it is for them. He knows they will never be able to teach again and could very well go to prison.

'He just wishes the whole thing had never happened. It's a shocking thing — a real shock for all of us — when you have teachers who should be educating doing this instead.'

MailOnline is not identifying the boy who turned 17 just days after the alleged ménage à trois as he is still a minor.

The boy is said to have had an ongoing affair with Dufresne, his 11th grade English teacher at Destrehan, a sleepy commuter town west of New Orleans.

According to police she picked him up after a Friday Night Lights high school football game on September 12 and drove him to Respess's apartment in Kenner, Louisiana — where she had only moved two weeks previously after living with her parents.

Respess, a pretty blonde who used the name 'CajunBabe' for her email addresses, decided she needed freedom away from her parents' upscale 3,900-sq. ft. home in Destrehan and moved 12 miles into a cramped apartment with peeling paint.

'She only moved in at the end of August,' a neighbor who would identify himself only as 'Will,' told MailOnline.

Love nest: Police say Respess invited her friend Dufresne and their underage lover to her apartment in the 1300 block of West Esplanade Avenue in Kenner for group sex

'There was a lot of activity going on in that short time.'

'All sorts of people you wouldn't expect were coming and going,' he added.

Dufresne, the daughter of a local judge, is separately charged with having sex with the teen in the small oil town of Montz, 25 miles west of New Orleans, where she lives with her oil company manager husband Wes and their three young children.

She was featured in a diet ad for xlr8fitness claiming she had lost 10 pounds in 75 days, MailOnline has learned. She posed in a bare midriff for the before and after photos.

Neighbors say the couple is still living together.

Police are currently looking at cellphones to see if rumored videos of the threesome exist. Sgt. Brian McGregor of Kenner Police told MailOnline forensic experts are examining the phones.

'These days things like iPhones are just like computers so forensics are looking to see what may have been deleted,' he said. He would not say who owns the devices being examined.

Respess and Dufresne were caught after the boy told friends he was having sex with two of his teachers, police say. Word soon traveled around the high school campus and school authorities brought in the cops.

Though the student was only a few days short of the age of consent in Louisiana, state law forbids teachers having sex with any of their students under 20.

Alumnus: Respess  is a Destrehan graduate who has been teaching English at the school for more than a year. She taught the boy involved last year

Pals: Respass' neighbor Will told MailOnline he had seen Dufresne at Respess's home in the Windsong apartment complex before the night of their alleged ménage à trois

Respess taught the boy English last year when he was a sophomore.

Her neighbor Will told MailOnline he had seen Dufresne at Respess's home in the Windsong apartment complex before the night of their alleged ménage à trois.

'As soon as I saw her picture in the paper I recognized her,' he said. 'She'd been round here several times.'

But he admits he did not see or hear anything on the night that the two teachers are said to have brought their student for some extracurricular activity. 'The walls on this place are pretty soundproof,' he said. 'But our dog barks at anything and I would have thought he would have heard something.

Will said he wants nothing to do with his new neighbor. 'My father used to say: "Bad people are contagious." That's how I feel about her.'

Despite lights blazing in Respess's ground floor apartment, no-one came to the door when MailOnline knocked.

One-bedroom apartments at Windsong start at $595 a month according to the complex's website.

Dufresne, who has two sons and a daughter all aged under 8, was originally arrested by the St. Charles Parish Sheriff's Department on September 29 and charged with having sex with the boy in Montz.

Then she and Respess were slapped with additional charges of 'having carnal knowledge of a juvenile' — official language for underage sex — indecent behavior with a juvenile and contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile. All those charges are in relation to the partying at Respess's apartment in Kenner which is in neighboring Jefferson Parish.

According to police. Dufresne enticed the boy to drive with her to Respess's home after the game — when Destrehan High nearly blew out a team nicknamed 'The Cougars.'

The Destrehan Wildcats beat the Helen Cox High Cougars by 48-7 with the visitors only scoring a late touchdown after most of Destrehan's starters had been withdrawn.

Police say the 'unlawful sexual acts' started on the night of September 12 'carrying over into the early morning of Saturday September 13.'

Cops also believe the threesome was Dufresne's idea and she 'propositioned' her younger colleague with her plan.

Respess told police she was aware that Dufresne was bringing the boy to her apartment for three-way sex.

A police report says that while Respess was having intercourse with the boy, Dufresne 'began intimately kissing (Respess) in an attempt to arouse all parties involved, all who were complete(ly) disrobed.'

Kenner Police Chief Mike Glaser said the boy told investigators he consented to the sex with the teachers and Respess gave a statement in which she 'almost' admitted having sex with the student but, he said, she did not go into 'intricate details.'

'She gave a similar account of his story,' the top cop said. 'But she stopped short of a total confession.'

Glaser said his investigators 'have no doubt' that both women had sex with their student.

Dufresne has taught English for 10 years at Destrehan High School, where met another teacher who now has been implicated in the sex abuse case

He called the allegations unfortunate but not surprising. 'Nothing surprises me any more really, but I do believe it's lack of a better judgment. They should have known better.

'You have an educator whose responsibility is the safety and education of the children and when it goes outside those lines I believe the community should be outraged,' Glaser added.

Both teachers had been students at Destrehan High and both went on to Louisiana State University.

On her page on the high school's website, Dufresne, who had taught there for 10 years, wrote: 'I take my job and my students' education seriously and try my best to help all of my students be successful; however, this requires work and effort on the part of each of my students.

'I hope that all of my students have a great experience in my classroom and leave with the tools they need to be successful throughout the rest of their high school careers and in life.'

School principal Stephen Weber sent parents and students a note after the women's arrests saying: 'I want to assure you that while the school system and proper authorities are conducting a thorough investigation of the allegations, you can be confident that teaching and learning, our core business, will continue effectively.'

Dufresne is due in court in St. Charles Parish, where her father Emile St. Pierre is senior judge, on October 23.

Judge Lauren Lemmon set Dufresne's bail at $200,000. She also ordered that she could only leave her single story brick home in Montz for 'continued mental health treatment, doctor appointments and church services.' Lemmon has since recused herself from the case because of her vlose professional relationship with Dufresne's father.

The two teachers are due in court in Jefferson Parish for the case involving the alleged threesome on November 17 for a status hearing. If convicted they face a jail sentence of up to 17½ years in prison.

Both are free on $7,000 bond in that case. Court records show Dufresne paid her bond in cash while Respess had to use a bail bond service.
