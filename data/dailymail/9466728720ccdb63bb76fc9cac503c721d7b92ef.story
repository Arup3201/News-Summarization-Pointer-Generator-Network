With the last dregs of murky water stagnating in the bottom, these are the desolate swimming pools dotted around America attached to long-forgotten motels.

The bleak scenes were captured as part of a series called  No Life Guard On Duty of pools at motels across the American South.

The contrast between the beautiful locations from Panama City Beach to Victorville, California and the grimy, empty pools is striking.

Grime: This abandoned pool and lawn furniture in Huntington has see better days

The images were shot by photographer J Bennett Fitts who traveled around 20,000 miles for the project.

The 35-year-old, who is originally from Kansas City but lives in LA, offers little explanation for his projects -preferring to let the pictures do the talking.

He earned his BFA from the Art Center of Design in Pasadena, California and since then has had his work featured in many collections and galleries.

Fitts' other projects have included a collection on golf, a series called America The Beautiful and another of industrial landscaping.

Motels grew in popularity across America in the 1950s when weary travelers would welcome the break in long journeys. Kitschy, family-run establishments soon gave way to giant chains dotting the highways.
