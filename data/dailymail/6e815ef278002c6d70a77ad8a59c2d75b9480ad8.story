A quick-thinking bus driver rescued a man trapped in a blazing building – by using his double-decker as an emergency platform.

Andy Waterman manoeuvred his vehicle alongside the inferno so the man could jump on to the roof from the second floor. 

The 48-year-old then drove off with his passenger – naked from the shower – balancing on the roof.

Yesterday he was hailed a hero after the unusual rescue in Braintree, Essex.

Hero: Bus driver Andy Waterman was praised for saving the mystery man's life. He moved his vehicle into position alongside the inferno so the man could jump on to the roof from the second floor

Blaze: Firefighters tackle the fire in Braintree, Essex. Andy said: ‘I manoeuvred my bus alongside the building until I was just four or five feet away and the man realised what I was doing and waited to jump onto my roof'

Mr Waterman was driving back to the depot after dropping off his last passengers when he was flagged down by a group frantically waving. 

He said: ‘I could see a bloke through all the smoke and I decided I had to do something because the fire brigade hadn’t arrived at that point.

‘I manoeuvred my bus alongside the building until I was just four or five feet away and the man realised what I was doing and waited to jump onto my roof.' 

He added: 'It was about six feet lower than the building but he managed it alright – the problem was that he had been in the shower and was naked. 

'I drove the bus away from the burning building and when the first of the emergency services arrived they threw him some clothes.

‘He was shivering pretty badly then – from fear and the freezing cold. But otherwise he was uninjured and the paramedics took him away for a check-up after firemen got him down from the roof of my bus.’

Inferno: A spokesman for Essex Fire and Rescue praised Andy's actions and added: ‘Without the quick-thinking of Mr Waterman this incident could have had a very different outcome and the man who managed to get onto the roof could well have lost his life’

Battle: Firefighters worked for approximately three hours to extinguish the fire

A spokesman for Essex Fire and Rescue said: ‘Without the quick-thinking of Mr Waterman this incident could have had a very different outcome and the man who managed to get onto the roof could well have lost his life.’

Andy’s boss at First Essex bus company Adrian Jones last night said: ‘We are very proud of him – he was in the right place at the right time and knew what to do. 

'We are pleased to know that the man is OK and we all wish him a speedy recovery.’
