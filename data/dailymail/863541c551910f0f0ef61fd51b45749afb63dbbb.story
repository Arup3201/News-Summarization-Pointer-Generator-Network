As the cultural safeguards of Shakespeare’s hometown, the lofty folk of Stratford-upon-Avon pride themselves on the very highest standards of taste.

So when swan-shaped plastic pedalos were suggested for the River Avon, Town Hall bosses were mortified, declaring: ‘We’re not Stratford-on-Blackpool'.

While their actions may have spared residents the sight of the ‘plastic monstrosities’, their comments have also resulted in an almighty row between the two cities.

'Plastic monstrosities': Politicians and residents welcomed Stratford-upon-Avon's decision to reject the swan pedalos

Dispute: The swan boats have proved popular in nearby Warwick but councillors in Stratford-upon-Avon do not approve

Blackpool tourist bosses have now hit back at the ‘cheap shot’, while the those in Stratford are refusing to apologise.

‘The people of Stratford are not being snobby, but Stratford is not Blackpool,’ the former mayor said yesterday.

‘We have a cultural and historical status to uphold, and these ginormous swans are not a part of that.’

Boating bosses had applied to Stratford District Council to replace four motor boats for public hire with the two-metre high plastic swan pedalos.

Row: Tourist bosses in Blackpool have hit back at the comments by Stratford-upon-Avon councillors calling it 'a cheap joke'

Despite the swans being used just nine miles down the river, in front of Warwick castle, the council rejected the application, deciding the boats were 'not in keeping with the historical or cultural nature of the town’.

The decision was welcomed by residents and local politicians.

Former Mayor of Stratford Cyril 
Bennis, said: ‘I'm very pleased with the council's decision. These huge 
gigantic swans are totally out of keeping with our river environment.

'They're totally void of all common decency. This is Stratford-upon-Avon,
not Stratford-on-Blackpool.

‘I have no objection to swans - I've been the official keeper of the swans in Stratford for more than 30 years.

‘But
these plastic monstrosities cannot be allowed in our towns. They have 
their place, but it's different strokes for different folk.’

Blackpool council
chiefs are furious about the comments, calling them a ‘cheap shot’ and 
saying residents in Stratford are ‘looking down their noses’.

Conservative Councillor Tony Lee, a 
former Deputy Mayor for Blackpool, said: ‘It winds me up.

'We know it's 
not the best place in the world for jobs and the weather isn't always 
perfect here but there's some lovely places to stay and lovely things to
do here.

‘I think it's most
rude. We have got so much to offer here. Everyone passes opinions but I bet he's never even been here.'

Not 'in keeping': Punters can enjoy a gondola ride in Stratford-upon-Avon but councillors have rejected the idea of swan pedalos

‘A lot of people look down their noses at Blackpool and I don't know why. They should come and try before passing comment.

‘I don't know why anyone would criticise Blackpool - it makes me angry and it's just sad.’

A spokesman for VisitBlackpool.com added: ‘We don't even have pedalos in Blackpool.

‘We're not too concerned about what other people might say when we've got so much going on here. It's just seems to be a silly cheap joke. He's entitled to his opinion, but we think he's wrong on this occasion.’

Matthew Bishop, from Leisure Boats UK, plans to appeal the council's decision.

He said: ‘The swans are safer than a motorboat or row boat. They are easy to steer, environmentally friendly and good for exercise.

‘Stratford is a family-friendly town, and I think the swan boats would actually be a positive thing.’
