Key clash: Antonio Candreva vs Junior Diaz

Andrea Pirlo and Mario Balotelli grabbed the plaudits following Italy’s win over England on Saturday, but it was Candreva that caused Roy Hodgson’s side the most problems. The attacker is happy to dribble with the ball and can cross with either foot, an unpredictability that will unsettle 30-year-old left back Diaz. 

Causing problems: Antonio Candreva (right) was a threat against England, dribbling past Leighton Baines

One to watch: Joel Campbell (Costa Rica)

The star of the show during Costa Rica’s stunning 3-1 victory over Uruguay in their opening game, the Arsenal striker, blessed with considerable pace and agility, is attracting a long list of admirers. Has the ability to stretch Italy’s far from mobile backline.

COSTA RICA HAVE TO CUT OFF CANDREVA

If Costa Rica's spies were watching closely when Italy beat England they must have noticed their success down the right flank. Antonio Candreva was a constant threat and his ability with both feet is impressive. He is just as good cutting inside as going down the line. His cross for Mario Balotelli on his left foot was excellent and Costa Rica must be wary of a repeat (right).

KEY MAN

I met Arsene Wenger at France's game with Honduras and he was very pleased with Joel Campbell. The Arsenal striker uses his speed well and he's good on the turn. Don't be surprised if Italy get cynical.

WIN THE MIND GAMES

Cesare Prandelli is one of the best tacticians in world football but this is a psychological challenge. Italy should win but can't afford to ease off - the runner up in Group D could easily face Brazil in the quarter-finals.
