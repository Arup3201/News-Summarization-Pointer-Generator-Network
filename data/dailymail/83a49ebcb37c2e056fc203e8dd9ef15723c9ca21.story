Still in love? Kim Kardashian and her ex boyfriend, NFL star Reggie Bush, pictured together here in June 2009

Kim Kardashian's former publicist claims the reality star has never got over her ex Reggie Bush - and that her marriage to Kris Humphries was a sham.

Jonathan Jaxson - who worked with the reality star between 2007 and 2009 - has renewed claims Kim's nuptials to NBA star Humphries were a publicity stunt.

Speaking on Good Day LA this morning, Jaxson said: 'Two weeks prior to her wedding she knew it was not something she wanted to do.

'Unfortunately they were obligated to 
honour contracts [with the E! network which had TV rights] otherwise they 
would have owed a lot of people a lot of money.'

Earlier this week during an interview with New York's Elvis 
Duran and the Morning Show, Jaxson said: 'She's never gotten over [her ex 
Reggie Bush].'

Kim, 31, and 26-year-old NFL star Reggie were the subject of repeated engagement claims throughout their relationship.

The
couple dated for around two years before initially splitting in July 
2009. Two months later they got back together before ending their 
relationship again in March last year.

Jaxson claimed he would often help Kim stage publicity stunts when he worked with her.

He continued: 'I staged several of the moments that
the world has seen of her, such as a ring that we alleged was from 
Reggie Bush.'

The publicist
talked about how he helped generate a fake engagement story between Kim
and Reggie in 2007 by setting up paparazzi to take pictures of her 
leaving a Beverly Hills jewellery store.

She
then sported a ring on her wedding finger in public - which Jaxson 
claimed is identical to the one Kris proposed to Kim with.

Jaxson added that there is no doubt Kim and Kris, 26, made a packet during their time together.

Despite
Kim's mother Kris Jenner insisting her daughter 'didn't make a dime out
of the wedding - responding to reports the couple netted a whopping 
$17.9m - Jaxson begs to differ.

He told the radio show on Wednesday: 'They had a lot of contracts, they had endorsements.
To say they weren't paid is a lot of foolish garbage.'

Kim is yet to respond to her former publicist's claims.

But
she has publicly denied her marriage to Kris - who she filed for 
divorce from just 72 days after the Montecito nuptials - was fake.

'Anyone that would get married for a TV show, it's just, you know, 
ridiculous,' she said.

'It's just sad that I even have to defend that.'

Meanwhile, it has emerged that Humphries is using Minnesota-based lawyer Lee Hutton to end his marriage with Kim.

Hutton represents a lot of sports stars, although does not tend to deal with divorces, according to TMZ.

But as the divorce is quite straight forward,Â  it should not be an issue. Kim and Kris are not disputing who gets what in the division of assets due to the prenup being put in place.

The divorce should be finalised six months from the date Kim filed - the minimum time required by law.

Kim is currently in Atlanta shooting for a cameo role in the Tyler Perry movie, The Marriage Counsellor and was spotted on set again today for her last day of filming.

Yesterday her mother Jenner jetted out to visit her daughter for an overnight stay before flying back to LA today.
