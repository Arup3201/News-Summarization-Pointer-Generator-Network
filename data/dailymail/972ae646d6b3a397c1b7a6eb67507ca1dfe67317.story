From growing up on a farm in Mudgee, in central west NSW but not being allowed own a horse, to running a farm full of them, and all this in between managing a part-time modelling career this country girl has a lot on her plate.

Temika Gillespie lives a double life between getting horses looking gorgeous and ready to race at the track; split with stunning and starring in photoshoots for an entirely different audience.

The 24-year-old told the Daily Mail Australia 'I've always been a country girl, I grew up with sheep and cattle, but I was never allowed a horse.' Now she manages a horse farm in the Hunter Valley, a few hundred kilometres from Sydney, full-time.

Temika Gillespie leads a double life as a racehorse strapper and part-time model

Living on a 120 acre property with just her dog and all the horses of course, Ms Gillespie didn't even ride a one until she was 17, and she's never had a single lesson.

To add another element to the equation, shes also a strapper for a horse racer named Jeremy Sylvester, and she travels to different competitions around the state as his assistant.

'I strap his racehorses a couple of times a week...He calls me his assistant manager'

The young woman, originally from central-west NSW also runs a horse farm in the Hunter Valley region full-time

'I shampoo the, wash them, trim their manes and tails, get them as presented as I can, keep them as calm as I can, and give them massages and keep them relaxed until they race,' she revealed.

On the other side of her life, Ms Gillespie's modelling career features a lot of bridal work, which she hopes to move away from, but the way it all began was unexpected.

'I went to a photoshoot with one of my friends, and the photographer who shot that contacted me after and said I needed to do one too.'

She often uses her own horses in photoshoots and has never had riding lessons

Bringing some of her 18 horses in some of the shoots was her own idea, and she said despite her love for both worlds she'll always be a country girl at heart.

Ms Gillespie said she gets a lot of attention when she's down at the tracks, but it's not the ideal place to find a partner. 'Though I'll stop and have a chat to anyone,' she added.

When asked if she would consider abandoning them for a modelling career, Ms Gillespie said the decision was too difficult to make.

'It would have to be amazing, or if I could do something like that part-time it would be ideal.'

Her ambition lies in working as a brand ambassador for a big label, admitting that she's done enough bridal shoots, saying 'it's very weird for a single girl.'
