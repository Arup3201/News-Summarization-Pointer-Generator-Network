Michael Laudrup has confirmed he will join Qatari club Lekhwiya on a one-year contract, indicating it might be the last position of his illustrious career in football.

Sportsmail revealed on June 22 that the Dane had agreed all terms with the Middle Eastern club following meetings in Qatar and London.

Now he has completed his return to management after a five-month absence following his sacking from Swansea in February, taking over at the Qatari champions from former Marseille boss Eric Gerets, who left last in May.

New adventure: Michael Laudrup has been appointed as the new coach of Qatari club Lekhwiya

The 50-year-old said: ‘I’m heading into my last phase as a coach. But whether Lekhwiya will be my last or second-last team remains to be seen.

'And I don’t know it the phase will stretch over two, three or four years. The answer is blowing in the wind.'

Good times: Laudrup won the League Cup in his time at Swansea

Laudrup was initially a huge success in Wales, winning the Capital One Cup in his first season and leading the club to a ninth-place finish in the Barclays Premier League.

But his spell turned sour the following summer when a huge row erupted over transfers. Issues over the quality of his training sessions later surfaced before he was replaced by Garry Monk in February, with the club struggling to juggle their domestic and Europa League commitments.
