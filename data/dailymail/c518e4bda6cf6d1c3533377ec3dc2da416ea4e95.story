Cult classic: The Last Dragon was a breakout role for Leo O'Brien, who died on Wednesday

A star of the 1980s cult classic martial arts film The Last Dragon died mysteriously in New York City on Wednesday.

Leo O'Brien's cause of death was not immediately known.

He was 41 years old.

An autopsy of the body was reportedly inconclusive.

O'Brien played Richie Green, the younger brother of the film's protagonist [Bruce] Leroy Green.

Taimak, who played Leroy Green, told TMZ that O'Brien's family believed he had been in failing health recently.

O'Brien was hospitalised last year after he was shot, allegedly by a friend - but survived.

He was shot three times - twice in the stomach and once in the arm - on September 5, 2011.

In an interview with the New York Post from his Harlem hospital bed, O'Brien said: 'At the time, I was walking up the block to the barber get a shave.

'He just came up and shot me. No words ... Then he started crying and ran.'

O'Brien told the Post that he was eager to recover so that he could get back into acting.

The Last Dragon was released in 1985 by TriStar pictures.

After the film's release, O'Brien had roles in Rappin' with Mario Van Peebles and New Jack City opposite Wesley Snipes - and also appeared in two episodes of Law & Order.
