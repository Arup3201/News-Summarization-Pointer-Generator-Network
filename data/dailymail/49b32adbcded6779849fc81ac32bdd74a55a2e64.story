New EU president Jean-Claude Juncker has warned David Cameron not to ‘beat up’ European immigrants to win votes.

The European Commission chief said the free movement of workers ‘cannot be questioned’ and urged Mr Cameron not to introduce rules which ‘discriminate’ against foreigners.

Mr Juncker’s controversial intervention comes after the Prime Minister outlined plans to ban immigrants claiming benefits or tax credits for four years.

The proposal will form the centrepiece of Mr Cameron’s renegotiation of Britain’s membership of the European Union.

But in his first comments on the issue since Mr Cameron’s set-piece speech, Brussels most powerful bureaucrat warned against measures which would scapegoat poorer migrants working legally.

He told the Guardian: ‘In Great Britain, which always fought for the enlargement of the European Union, there has to be an end to discrimination against countries just because it goes down well topically when you beat up others.'

He added: ‘I am utterly against behaving as if all Poles, all Romanians, all Bulgarians in the European labour market are of a basic mentality that is criminal. These are people who are working and earning their wages.’

Mr Juncker said he was happy to discuss Mr Cameron’s proposals. He said: ‘We did not shoot down these ideas right away because I believe that we have to talk about them.

‘I am really interested in Great Britain remaining an active and constructive member of the EU.’

But he warned any undermining of the free movement would damage the common market – one of Margaret Thatcher’s lasting European achievements.

He said: ‘This fundamental right of free movement of workers cannot be questioned existentially because if you question the free movement of workers Great Britain has to know that one day the free movement of capital will also be called into question.

‘Then it will be the end for London’s tax rulings, that will no longer be possible in London.

‘For me it is clear that free movement of labour was not enshrined in the treaties so that it could be abused. But it is the national legislatures who should fight against this abuse.’

Mr Juncker took over the European Commission last month in the face of fierce hostility from Downing Street.
