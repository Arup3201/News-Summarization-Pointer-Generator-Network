A teacher ordered two seven-year-old boys to strip to their underwear at a Danish school before threatening to cut off their penises with a pair of scissors.

The pupils were made to take their clothes off after forgetting to bring Santa hats to a Christmas party at Strandmølle School in Assens, western Funen.

It has been reported that the youngsters were also told to climb into bin bags in front of the whole school.

The school admitted that the action was inappropriate adding that even though it had not been funny, it had only been meant as a joke.

But the parents were not satisfied with the response and complained to a child protection group, which urged them to report it to the police.

The school’s deputy chairman of the board, Thomas Hald, said: 'It is correct that it happened and that this type of humour is something that we on the board naturally do not condone.' 

He said the fact that the teacher apologised was enough and regarded the matter as closed.

Children’s advocacy group Borns Vilkar however said the school's action was not enough.

Spokeswoman Bente Boserup adding: 'Children have been violated and threatened. 

'In this kind of situation the children and their families don’t get any kind of help because all energies are used on closing the system in on itself and taking the adults into consideration instead of the children.'

A local police spokesman said that they had received an official complaint and were investigating.
