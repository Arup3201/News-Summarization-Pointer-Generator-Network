Junior dos Santos admitted he was nervous on his victorious return to the Octagon against Stipe Miocic on Saturday night.

The Brazilian heavyweight was fighting for the first time in 14 months and was pushed all the way in Phoenix, Arizona.

The former champion was given the nod by all three judges by scores of 48-47 and 49-46 (twice).

But he said: ‘I didn’t feel comfortable fighting. My opponent was very tough. I was a little nervous I think because of the time I was out.

‘But right now I believe this fight showed good things about both of us.’

Dos Santos was the odds-on favorite, but Miocic made it difficult with Dos Santos’ consistency in landing straight right hands and left hooks that made the difference.

Miocic, a part-time firefighter from Cleveland, clearly thought it was a closer fight, immediately leaving the cage upon hearing the decision.

Dos Santos, who has only ever lost to current champion, Cain Velasquez, will now be looking to reclaim that title but will have to wait in line behind current interim champion Fabricio Werdum before he gets another shot at the belt.

In the night’s co-main event, the No 3 ranked lightweight, Rafael dos Anjos, outclassed Nate Diaz to secure the win by unanimous decision (30-26, 30-26, 30-27).

After the fight Dos Anjos said: ‘I’d love to have a chance for the title... that’s my dream. I want to be the first Brazilian to hold the lightweight belt.’

In response, UFC president Dana White confirmed; ‘With Khabib (Nurmagomedov) not being healthy, it’s Dos Anjos (who gets the next title shot).’
