Insight: Search warrants will be released at 9:01am Wednesday that could give insight into the mind of gunman Adam Lanza

No one knew what caused Adam Lanza to enter Sandy Hook Elementary School last December armed with several assault weapons, gunning down teachers and students in one of the worst school massacres the country has ever seen. 

But search warrant documents released today could shed some light on the 20-year-old killer’s motives and his mental state that led to the December 14 shooting that left 20 children and six educators dead.

The documents will be released as an order that kept them sealed expires, making them available to the public, and will contain - among other things - a full list of the things that were recovered from Lanza's car and house.

The five warrants could help answer why Lanza turned a gun on his mother, 52-year-old Nancy Lanza, at their home before driving off to the nearby elementary school with a Bushmaster .223-caliber with a 30-round magazine before turning another one of his mother’s guns on himself.

As NBC News’ Open Channel reports, the sealed documents include information on the five search warrants ordered for the Lanza’s sprawling home in Sandy Hook, as well as the Honda Civic that sat in their driveway.

Connecticut Superior Court Judge John F. Blawie granted a motion Wednesday to redact specific information from the affidavits, including a name of a witness, telephone numbers, and other personal identifiers.

The prosecutor's motions were approved by a Danbury Superior Court judge, clerk Geoffrey Stowell said. Gov. Dannel P. Malloy announced last week that additional information would be released at his request. 

The Connecticut governor expressed concern that certain information about the shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School disclosed by a top state police commander at a recent law enforcement seminar in New Orleans was leaked.

'Like many others, I was disappointed and angered to learn that certain information about the Newtown shooting had been leaked, specifically with concern for the victims' families who may have been hearing this news for the first time,' the governor said in a statement.

A column published last week in the New York Daily News, citing an unnamed police officer who attended the seminar, reported that Col. Daniel Stebbins discussed evidence that suggested the Newtown gunman, 20-year-old Lanza, studied other mass slayings and dedicated extensive planning to the rampage that left 20 first-graders and six educators dead.

The seminar was designed for law enforcement professionals only and sensitive information dealing with the tactical approaches used by first responders to the Sandy Hook shootings was discussed, state police spokesman Lt. J. Paul Vance said.

Danbury State’s Attorney Stephen Sedensky III briefed victims’ parents Wednesday night in a two-and-a-half hour meeting, according to the New Haven Register.

The documents were unsealed at midnigh

t, meaning that the family of those killed would be able to see the documents before reporters are emailed at 9:01 Thursday morning.

Asked by the paper how the parents responded, Mr Sedensky said it was ‘hard to say.’

Jimmy Greene, who is the father of victim Anna Marquez-Green, told the paper that he did not want to comment on the meeting.

‘It’s been a tough day.’

Additional reports have emerged that Lanza was obsessed with other mass killings, and had modeled his attack after the 2011 Norway attack of white supremacist Anders Behring Breivik, who shot and killed 77 people, mostly teenagers, in a combined bombing and shooting.

In a joint investigation from PBS’ ‘Frontline’ and the Hartford Courant, reporters found that even as a child, Lanza hated to be touched.

There has also been unconfirmed speculation that Lanza had been deeply influenced by violent video games.

Senate President Donald E. Williams Jr. said this week that legislative leaders hope to review the search warrant documents before finishing work on a bipartisan bill that addresses gun control and other issues related to the massacre. 

Last week, Sen. Diane Feinstein, the sponsor of the polarizing gun control bill announced to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid that the assault weapons clause had been dropped.

The senator said that she hopes to offer a ban on military-style firearms as an amendment as the bill moves to the Senate in April.
