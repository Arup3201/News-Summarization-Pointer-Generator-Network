Usher has been left 'completely devastated' after his 11-year-old stepson was declared brain dead.

The rapper is said to feel 'distraught' after doctors revealed Kyle Glover - the child of the singer's ex-wife Tameka and her former partner Ryan Glover – had 'not experienced any brain activity' since being admitted to hospital on Saturday after he was struck on the head by a jet ski in Lake Lanier in Atlanta, Georgia.

Trauma: The 11-year-old stepson of Usher pictured with wife Tameka back 
in 2008, has been declared 'brain dead' by doctors after a jet ski 
accident

Critical: The child was taken to the Children's Healthcare unit at Egelston Hospital in Atlanta

A source close to 33-year-old rapper told HollywoodLife.com: 'Usher is completely devastated and shaken with what has occurred.

'[He] is emotionally drained from the
accident. He feels incredibly awful, distraught … it’s been a complete 
rollercoaster of emotions.'

The schoolboy, who was unresponsive when rescued from the water, was struck in the head 
by a 38-year-old man riding a jet ski as he rode an inner tube towed by a
speedboat on Lake Lanier in Atlanta, Georgia.

It has emerged today that the man Jeffrey S. Hubbard was a family friend, according to RadarOnline.

He is named in an incident report from the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR).

A 15-year-old female companion was also reported to have been struck.

Tameka was 'extremely thankful' to 
Usher after he reportedly chartered a plane allowing her to fly to 
Atlanta to be at Kyle's side, and she has taken to her Facebook page to 
thank fans for their support and urge them to pray for her son.

The mother-of-five wrote: 'Kyle, You 
are strong ... You'll be saved I know it. I love you my baby. I need all
#Prayers for my son! thanks you everybody! (sic)'

A decision has yet to be made on whether to take the youngster off life support, and the incident is now being investigated.

Critical: Usher, pictured with Tameka back in 2008, with three of his stepsons, including Kyle who is is said to be carrying

Usher, 33, split from Tameka back in 2009 with their divorce finalised later that year.

Kyle is one of two sons Tameka had by Atlanta clothier Ryan Glover. She gave birth to her first son as a teenager.

Tameka also has two children by the singer, Usher Raymond VI, four, and three-year-old Naviyd Ely Raymond.
