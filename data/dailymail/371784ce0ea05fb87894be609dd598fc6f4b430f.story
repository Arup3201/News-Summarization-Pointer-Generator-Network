Lewis Hamilton believes he is now perfectly equipped to handle the pressure that will come with his latest Formula One title-decider.

Hamilton heads into the all-or-nothing clash with Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg in Abu Dhabi on November 23 - with the scrap being dubbed 'The Duel in the Desert' - with a 17-point advantage.

The introduction this season of double points for the final race has added a touch of controversy to proceedings, and offered Rosberg a more significant lifeline than he might otherwise have had.

Hamilton, however, is not planning to let any issues overshadow his judgement going into the clash at the Yas Marina circuit.

Now in his eighth season, his experience will prove vital, a quality he lacked in his two previous last-race title fights in his rookie year of 2007 and subsequent campaign in 2008.

In 2007, Hamilton let slip a 17-point lead - when there were only a maximum of 10 points for a win - with two races remaining.

In 2008, only an overtaking manoeuvre on the final corner of the last lap allowed him to become champion.

Comparing then to now, Hamilton said: 'In those two years, as far as I can remember, I definitely felt the tension more over those two weekends.

'I know I am more prepared now than I have ever been. I am stronger now than I was then, both mentally and physically.

'It is different now and I hope that experience counts for something.

'Going into this last one, I don't think there is a special recipe for it. I just have to go and do what I have been doing.

'I have to drive the way I have been driving in recent races because generally it has been good.'

Hamilton maintains all he can do is follow simple routines, as he has over many years, and not let any negative thoughts or distractions impinge on his focus.

'What will be, will be,' added Hamilton.

'There is no point dwelling on it. It is going to happen one way or another.

'All I can do is make sure I do the best I can over the whole weekend and the rest will follow in whichever direction.

'Immediately before the race I'll do the same stuff I always do - go and take a pee, then stand for the national anthem and then get on with my driving.

'That's what I have done at every race this year.'

In terms of his build-up ahead of flying to Abu Dhabi, Hamilton aims to keep calm and relaxed.

'I'll spend some time with the family, with my dogs, my girlfriend, as well a day or two at the factory,' added Hamilton.

'I won't be thinking about racing, that's for sure.'
