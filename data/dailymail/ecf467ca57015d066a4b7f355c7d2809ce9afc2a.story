White people are suffering from an unspoken racism in Britain, according to the mother of murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence.

Doreen Lawrence will this week warn that British society is going ‘backwards’ in terms of equality and that white minority groups are among those facing racism.

Despite some progress on race and equality in the 20 years since her son’s murder, in many ways the problems are getting worse as racism is ‘no longer on the political agenda’, she will say.

Politics and professions are dominated by an ‘old boys’ network’, according to Mrs Lawrence – who will say that we still live in a country ‘organised and shaped’ by race.

Doreen Lawrence, Mother of murdered student Stephen Lawrence, will this week warn that British society is going 'backwards' in terms of equality and that white minority groups are among those facing racism

Mrs Lawrence, 60, will say that racism within the British education system is holding back talented black youngsters. It is more difficult for black students than white people to achieve a first-class degree, she will claim.

Those who do obtain qualifications and have so-called ‘good accents’ still suffer from racism, she will say.

Mrs Lawrence’s remarks will come in a speech she is to deliver at the opening of a research centre specialising in race and education at Birmingham University later this week.

‘Race matters: it matters to all of us,’ she will say. ‘Crucially, when we talk about race we are not just talking about the experiences of black and minority ethnic groups.

‘We are also talking about the experiences of white groups. Yet this is something that we, as a society, seldom acknowledge or discuss.’

Mrs Lawrence will add: ‘I want – we all want – a society in which we can live safely and freely irrespective of the colour of our skin.

‘We want a society in which success and choice are not merely limited to the few but are available to all. A society where the old boys’ network – in other words a network which is male, wealthy and white –- no longer automatically leads across the professions and our Parliament.

‘Just as we are a society that continues to be organised and shaped by class and by gender, we are a society that – some 20 years after Stephen’s murder – continues to be organised and shaped by race.’

Despite some progress on race and equality in the 20 years since her son¿s murder, in many ways the problems are getting worse as racism is 'no longer on the political agenda', she will say

Professor David Gillborn, director of the new centre, said: ‘Debates about education are almost solely based around class but what we have found is that, despite having a professional education and good income and knowing their way around the education system, black middle-class parents still face an uphill battle against the chronic low expectations that many teachers bring to their interactions with black children.’

Stephen Lawrence, 18, a student who was hoping to become an architect, was stabbed to death by a gang of racist white youths in Eltham, South East London, in April 1993.

Last year two men, Gary Dobson and David Norris, were jailed for life for his murder following a campaign to bring them to justice supported by the Daily Mail.

Following Stephen’s death, a public inquiry into the police’s handling of the tragedy concluded the Metropolitan Police was institutionally racist.

Earlier this year, Mrs Lawrence was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of York in recognition for her work against racism.

At the ceremony on January 25 she was praised for ‘devoting a large part of her life to social justice’. She was also honoured for her ‘tireless campaign against racism and inequality’ as a result of her lengthy wait to see her son’s murderers jailed.

Accepting the award, Mrs Lawrence said: ‘I see education as the most precious gift that we can give our children.’

In the years after her son’s death, Mrs Lawrence founded the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust to help young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.

She also sits on the board of Liberty, the human rights organisation, and is a patron of the hate-crime charity Stop Hate UK.

In 2003, she was appointed an OBE for services to community relations.

Last summer she was chosen as a flagbearer at the Opening Ceremony for the London 2012 Olympics, alongside boxer Muhammad Ali and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.

Last year, Mrs Lawrence also received a special prize at the Women of the Year awards, as well as another honorary doctorate from the University of East London.
