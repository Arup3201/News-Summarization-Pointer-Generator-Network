President Obama was involved in a mystifying incident when he shook hands with a man in a horse mask while meeting members of the public yesterday.

Obama was pictured smiling and shaking hands with the prankster as he went on an unscheduled walkabout in Denver, Colorado.

The mask became a popular internet meme a few years ago, when people started wearing the odd headgear in unusual settings and posting the pictures online.

The reasons for his sartorial choice 
remained unclear. Obama's Secret Service agents seemed to keep a close 
eye on him as he shook hands with the man.

Obama also apparently laughed off an offer of marijuana during the visit.

In an apparently reply, Obama just tilts his head back and laughs.

Recreational marijuana became legally available for purchase in Colorado in January.

Tuesday night's escapades were part of Obama's continuing quest to break free from the constraints of the White House - and they brought him to a crowded pizza restaurant and a pool bar.

Shortly after arriving in Denver, Obama headed to the Wazee Supper Club for dinner with local residents who had recently written him letters. It was a carefully orchestrated event aimed at projecting an image of the president connecting with real Americans.

But after his meal, Obama decided to break from the script : he took off by foot down 15th Street, a cadre of anxious Secret Service agents by his side, and started shaking hands with the dozens of people who had gathered on the sidewalks.

There were kids eager for a picture with the president and adults who held up their hands for a high-five or fist bump.

Obama increasingly has been showing his frustration with the restrictive White House security bubble and referring to himself as a 'bear on the loose.' In recent weeks, he's been hitting restaurants in Washington and vowing to spend more time with the public outside of the nation's capital.

After his 10-minute stroll, Obama hopped back into his armored limousine for a short drive to his next destination, Wynkoop Brewing Co., which was founded by Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper.

As Obama walked inside and said 'How's it going guys?' someone inside said 'Get that man a beer!' according to ABC News.

Inside the pub, Obama was also photographed posing for pictures with a giant gorilla statue.

On a more serious note, Obama was seen inside the pub presenting a challenge coin to Kalynne May Arrick. Her older brother Sgt. Kenneth May died while serving as a Marine in Afghanistan.

The governor — a Democrat facing re-election this fall — was waiting for Obama inside. They headed to the bar where they ordered two Rail Yard Ales, then headed upstairs for a game of pool.

Obama enjoyed his beverage, and said 'That's some tasty beer,' according to ABC News.

As Vanilla Ice's classic song 'Ice Ice Baby' played in the background, Obama sank the eight-ball to claim victory over Hickenlooper. And on at least this occasion, Obama wanted to make sure the media were nearby.

He turned to the traveling press corps and said, 'Did you record that?'
