Ambition: Devout Christian Alan Gendreau is hoping to become the first gay professional football player in the NFL

The lack of gay role models in sport is an issue which still draws criticism and shame for teams around the world.

However, one man is hoping to change all of that for the NFL by becoming the first gay professional football player.

Devout Christian Alan Gendreau is now a free agent and is hoping to join a team as its kicker.

Hailing from Florida, he was a kicking machine for the Middle Tennessee state's Blue Raiders.

As a successful team member, the 5-foot, 10-inch athlete also felt accepted by his teammates.

And he's now hoping to achieve the same thing on the biggest stage of all.

Speaking to OutSports, as reported by the Huffington Post, he said: 'I just want people to know that you can still be who you are and the best you can be and still be gay.

'I want people to know that it is ok. That would be my biggest goal in doing all of this.'

The kicker graduated last year and knows it would be difficult to get into the NFL this year.

He is currently a free agent and only the New York Jets and Carolina Panthers are looking to draft a kicker this year.

If and when he does make the NFL, however, Gendreau would be the first gay professional football player.

He would also be the first professional player to enter the league openly gay.

It recently emerged that about four current football players are in talks to come out in the future.

The NFL has met with gay rights groups recently to discuss policies to end homophobia and discrimination.

It is likely that the first, openly gay football star will earn millions in endorsement deals.
