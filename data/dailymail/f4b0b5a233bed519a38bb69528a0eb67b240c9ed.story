Rebels motorcycle club leader Alex Vella has suffered a double blow with the cancellation of his Australian visa and loss of a close mate and fellow senior club member.

The Rebels national president had planned to return from a visit to his native Malta when he discovered the federal government had cancelled his visa.

It was cancelled under character provisions in the Migration Act last Friday, the Immigration Department said.

Mr Vella, 60, is understood to be in Malta figuring out his next move.

With the high profile leader gone, the Rebels club have taken another hit with the death of the club's Sergeant at Arms, Simon Rasic.

Mr Rasic, son of former Socceroos coach Rale Rasic who guided the national team to the 1974 World Cup, died on Sunday night.

Friend and Rebels member 'Little Mick' Kosenko said Mr Rasic, who had been a club member for more than 20 years, died suddenly.

'It was very unexpected,' the United Motorcycle Council Queensland spokesman said on Tuesday.

'He was a very fit and healthy person. It's a great loss.'

Mr Kosenko said Mr Rasic, a father of four, died following complications from a recent operation.

The Rebels club also lost their Sergeant at Arms, Simon Rasic, on Sunday when he died suddenly following complications from a recent operation

He said Mr Vella had already planned to cut his trip short to attend his sister-in-law's funeral on Tuesday prior to Mr Rasic's death.

Mr Vella has struggled with his Australian visa since he was convicted in 1995 of possessing a trafficable quantity of cannabis.

His property was later raided by police who seized and froze $3 million worth of his assets.Mr Vella clawed his assets back after paying a $650,000 settlement to the NSW Crime Commission.

Supporters have leapt to Mr Vella's defence, painting the bikie boss as a churchgoing, motorcycle enthusiast.

'This man actually goes to church every week and is always willing to lend a helping hand, unlike the hypocrites that sit in government,' Motorcycle Clubs Australia posted on Facebook.

'What has he done to deserve what they have been doing to him for so many years?

'Everyone has a hobby in life and his is riding motorcycles.'

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison defended the decision to cancel Mr Vella's visa, saying he had received briefings about activities of the Rebels club

Speaking about the visa cancellation, Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said it was his duty to respond to the work of state and federal law enforcement agencies.

'When something is asked of me in this area, it is my duty to respond,' he told Fairfax Radio on Tuesday.

Mr Morrison said he had received briefings about activities of the Rebels club.

It is not the first time an Australian government has tried to keep Mr Vella, who does not have citizenship, from coming into the country.

In 2007, when he went to Japan to watch his boxer son Adam Vella in a fight, Mr Vella struggled to return after his visa expired.

He returned to Australia three weeks later after police failed to provide evidence for revoking his visa on character grounds.

Mr Vella told Fairfax Media on Tuesday he was a innocent man.

'We are not a criminal organisation despite what the police continue to say about us,' he said.

'We are simply easy targets.'
