Carmen Bejan, 23, was jailed for 20 years together with her medical student boyfriend Sergiu Florea for the murder of a pensioner

A medical student who murdered a man then cut up his body is suing prison officials in Romania claiming her baby was stillborn because they wouldn't let her out to satisfy her pregnancy cravings.

Carmen Bejan fell pregnant last year following a relationship with another inmate and gave birth to a stillborn daughter with deformities, including no hands, this week.

However, she claims she did not receive correct care throughout her pregnancy and claims this amounts to the child in effect being 'murdered.'

Lawyers for the 23-year-old revealed she is planning to sue the prison believing the link between her not being allowed to fulfill her cravings and the stillbirth to be 'substantial'.

In March she spoke about how it was 'pure torture' waking up with cravings for everything from bananas on toast through to cheese flavour crisps - none of which were possible to satisfy in jail.

She said: 'These cravings are a way for a woman's body to tell her what foods are needed to satisfy the mineral and vitamin requirements of the unborn child.

'By denying me access to those foods they are causing mental torture to myself and physical risk to my unborn child.

'The cravings make me really sick because I can't get the food I crave for unless I get visits from my family, and the only thing I can do is keep on suffering. What pains me most is that my child is in pain also - I fear I could lose the baby because of these cravings, but I have the feeling nobody cares.'

Bejan's baby was conceived during one of the 'intimate visits' allowed under Romanian law.

The father is her husband, Claudiu Stratan, a convicted drug dealer that she met while on remand.

Doctors had previously said the child was developing normally.

Sorin Prisca, a medic from the Arad penitentiary who took care of the pregnant woman, says the malformations were due to stress. He said an investigation was currently being carried out to see if there had been a medical error somewhere during the pregnancy.

Bejan claims she had nightmares throughout her pregnancy of giving birth to a monster.

This week, Stratan said: 'She had eight ultrasound scans during the pregnancy. Each time she was told everything was okay.  But I don’t think they were looking at the scans properly. The first time they said the baby was a boy.

Bejan has told prison officials that it was 'pure torture' waking up with cravings for everything from bananas on toast through to cheese flavour crisps - none of which were possible to eat in jail

'Then they said it was a girl. I don’t think they even bothered to look at the scans properly. It was all just superficial. How can it be that the baby was allegedly fine and is then born with no hands and died shortly after delivery?'

When Bejan was told her baby was born she repeatedly shouted out 'They killed my baby' Romanian daily Cancan reported today.

It was also reported Bejan went into a deep shock before dissolving into floods of tears.

Bejan was  jailed for 20 years in 2009 together with her medical student boyfriend Sergiu Florea for the murder of a pensioner she'd promised to sleep with for money.

She had lured her victim back to their bedsit at Timisoara medical college, Romania, where they both killed and robbed him.

Afterwards, they used their surgical equipment to slice 65-year-old Trifu Schroth's body into small pieces to make it easier to dispose of.

They were caught when they were spotted loading the body parts in plastic sacks into the boot of their car by another student who called police.

The pair who were both found guilty tried to blame the gruesome killing on each other.

After hearing the news of the loss of the baby the widow of the murder victim Trifu Schroth, Lucretia said: 'God has punished her for what she did.'

During her last appeal for freedom during the pregnancy she said: 'I do not believe that words can convey how much suffering this is causing. I believe if I am not released I will not live to see the birth of my child.'

Earlier in an appeal hearing a prosecutor said: 'It is quite plain that she deliberately became pregnant just to get out of her sentence. It is outrageous,'

If she had won her appeal she could have been freed throughout her pregnancy and for the first year of her child’s life.
