Cesc Fabregas will face Arsenal for the first time this weekend since leaving the club in 2011. But how have previous Arsenal old boys fared in their first match against the club?

Thierry Henry

Arsenal 2-2 Barcelona, March 2010

Arsenal’s greatest ever goalscorer returned to the Emirates with Barcelona in the 2010 Champions League quarter-final but started on the bench. He replaced Zlatan Ibrahimovic — who scored both goals in the 2-2 draw — late on and was unsurprisingly given a hero’s welcome.

Patrick Vieira

Arsenal 2-0 Juventus, March 2006

After leaving for Juventus in the summer of 2005, the midfield general returned the very next season in the Champions League quarter-final. Despite a warm reception, Vieira was on the wrong end of a 2-0 scoreline and picked up a booking, which ruled him out of the second leg.

Robin van Persie 

Man Utd 2-1 Arsenal, November 2012

After the Dutchman left for Man United in 2012, he was jeered by his old fans when Arsenal travelled to Old Trafford. It did not take long for him to remind them of what they were missing - he scored after just three minutes in a 2-1 United win.

Gael Clichy 

Arsenal 1-0 Man City, April 2012

It was a lukewarm reception for Clichy when he made his first return to the Emirates in 2012. There were some early boos but the home crowd needn’t have worried as Clichy’s City side were undone by a late Mikel Arteta winner.

Samir Nasri

Arsenal 0-1 Man City, November 2011

The Frenchman was given some horrendous abuse when he returned to the Emirates after his move to Man City in 2011. But Nasri had the last laugh as his new team won at Arsenal for the first time in 36 years to seal a place in the League Cup semi-finals.

Emmanuel Adebayor 

Man City 4-2 Arsenal,September 2009

After swapping Arsenal for big-spending Man City in a £25million deal, the Togo striker scored against his former club at the Etihad. But there was no refusal to celebrate here. Adebayor sprinted the length of the pitch to revel in front of raging Arsenal supporters as City won 4-2.
