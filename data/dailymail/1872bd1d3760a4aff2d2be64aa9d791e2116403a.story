Top police officers were accused yesterday of suffering ‘collective amnesia’ about their failure to investigate the hacking of Milly Dowler’s phone.

The Surrey Police force was severely criticised over the actions of senior detectives investigating the schoolgirl’s murder.

An independent watchdog found there was knowledge of the hacking ‘at all levels’ of the team investigating the case.

Its head, Craig Denholm, even 
received documents mentioning it but nothing was done for almost a 
decade, when the phone-hacking scandal exploded.

The News of the World told Surrey 
Police that it had accessed Milly’s mobile phone messages within weeks 
of her disappearance in March 2002.

A former Surrey police officer has been arrested in connection with the investigation into alleged payments to public officials.

The
 41-year-old man was arrested at 6am this morning at his home in Sussex 
on suspicion of misconduct in a public office, Scotland Yard said.

The
 former officer, who is being interviewed at a Sussex police station, 
was arrested by officers from Operation Elveden - Scotland Yard’s 
investigation into alleged corrupt payments to public officials.

The
 arrest is the 62nd under Operation Elveden, which is being supervised 
by the Independent Police Complaints Commission and is running in 
conjunction with Operation Weeting, Scotland Yard’s inquiry into 
phone-hacking.

He is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on May 8.

But there was no investigation at the
 time. It was only after the Met launched Operation Weeting nine years 
later that  Milly’s parents were told her phone had been hacked.

The scandal exploded into the public 
consciousness with the inaccurate claim in the Guardian newspaper that 
the News of the World had also deliberately deleted messages on Milly’s 
phone, giving her parents false hope that she may still have been alive.
 The backlash sparked the Leveson Inquiry and calls for a new system of 
Press regulation.

However, it was later established that the messages had almost certainly been deleted automatically by the phone company.

Questions have been repeatedly raised
 over why police did not act in 2002, something which could have stemmed
 phone hacking in its infancy.

Their silence was seen by a tiny minority of journalists as a tacit admission that phone hacking was not illegal.

Yesterday, the Independent Police 
Complaints Commission said current and former senior officers were 
unable to explain why nothing was done over the hacking 11 years ago.

Deborah Glass, of the IPCC, said ‘phone hacking was a crime and this should have been acted upon’.

She suggested that if Surrey Police 
had investigated the Sunday newspaper’s actions, it may have stopped 
phone hacking in its tracks.

Tragic: Milly was a schoolgirl from Walton-on-Thames, shown here ironing in video released by her her family, whose murder shocked Britain

2002 – March 21: Milly Dowler, pictured left,  disappears near Walton-on-Thames railway  station while walking home from school.

April 13: A News of the World journalist tells  Surrey Police the newspaper has obtained information from the 13-year-old’s voicemail. Police do not attempt to prosecute.

2007 – January 26: News of the World royal  editor Clive Goodman and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire are jailed after admitting intercepting voicemail messages.

2011 – January: Scotland Yard opens Operation Weeting into claims that the phones of hundreds of celebrities were hacked.

April: Shortly before the trial of Levi Bellfield for Milly’s murder, police tell her parents that her mobile phone may have been hacked.

July 4: The Guardian reports that the News of the World hacked Milly’s phone and – inaccurately – that messages were deleted, giving her parents ‘false hope’ that she was alive.

July 10: The News of the World is shut down.

December 12: A Metropolitan Police lawyer tells the Leveson Inquiry it is ‘unlikely’ that journalists erased messages from Milly’s phone.

2012 – May 9: The Leveson Inquiry is told that the truth about how Milly’s phone messages were deleted may never emerge, and it probably happened automatically.

2013 – April 24: A highly critical Independent Police Complaints Commission report reveals that ‘all levels’ of Surrey Police had knowledge of the 2002 phone hacking but did nothing.

Instead, the illicit practice 
continued until it was exposed in 2011, sparking a national scandal, the
 closure of the News of the World and the Leveson Inquiry into media 
standards.

Animal: Levi Bellfield abducted and murdered the 13-year-old after she walked past his home

Mrs Glass added: ‘We have not been 
able to uncover any evidence, in documentation or witness statements, of
 why and by whom that decision was made.

‘Former senior officers, in 
particular, appear to have been afflicted by a form of collective 
amnesia in relation to the events of 2002.

‘This is perhaps not surprising, 
given the events of 2011 and the public outcry that the hacking of Milly
 Dowler’s phone produced.

‘However, it is scarcely credible 
that no one connected to the Milly Dowler investigation recognised the 
relevance and importance of the information Surrey Police held in 2002.’

Former nightclub doorman Levi 
Bellfield was convicted of murdering Milly and sentenced to a whole life
 tariff in June 2011. Several weeks later the phone-hacking scandal 
broke.

In the ensuing furore, Surrey Police 
set up an inquiry to look into claims officers were aware that the News 
of the World intercepted her voicemail.

It soon emerged that journalists had volunteered information about their illegal actions but police did not investigate.

Yesterday, the IPCC said that in 2002
 the force’s focus was finding the missing girl but noted claims of an 
‘unhealthy relationship’ with the media.

Officials said they could not find 
evidence to disprove Mr Denholm’s claim that he did not know and did not
 make the ‘relevant connections’.

Probe: Deputy Chief Constable Craig Denholm,

Operation Weeting: Probe into phone hacking.

Set up in January 2011 it has 96 officers working on it and has cost £11.2million so far.

Operation Elveden: Probe into corrupt payments to officials.

Elveden has 70 police investigating and
 has cost £5million.

Operation Tuleta: Probe into computer hacking.

Set up in June 2011, Tuleta has cost £1.3million and has 19 officers on its staff.

Total arrests across all three: 109

The officer, now Surrey’s deputy chief constable, will receive ‘words of advice’ – the lowest possible sanction.

He is understood to be preparing to 
retire next year on a pension of up to £80,000 a year, depending on the 
size of any lump sum he chooses to receive.

Mr Denholm was succeeded as senior 
investigating officer on the murder inquiry by Maria Woodall, now a 
detective superintendent.

She, too, will not face any 
discipline charge, but will also receive words of advice. Surrey Chief 
Constable Lynne Owens said she had apologised personally to the Dowler 
family for the failings of her force.

She said: ‘At the time Surrey Police 
became aware of phone hacking, the focus of the investigation team was 
on finding Milly Dowler and then bringing her killer to justice.

It was right that Milly was the 
primary focus of the investigation but the matter of phone hacking 
should have been revisited at a later stage.’
