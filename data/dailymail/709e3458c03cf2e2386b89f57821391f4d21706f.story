Death Row: Hank Skinner was convicted in 1995 of killing his live-in girlfriend Twila Busby and her two adult sons, Randy Busby and Elwin Caler in 1993

A triple murderer on death row - due to be executed in two-and-a-half weeks - is facing a race against time to prove his innocence.

Henry Watkins 'Hank' Skinner - convicted of murdering his girlfriend and her two adult sons in Pampa, Texas, on New Year's Eve 1993 - claims there is untested DNA evidence that could exonerate him.

The DNA in question went untested during the original trial because Skinner's lawyer believed it could actually incriminate him.

But Skinner, 49, says this was a decision that he never agreed to - and is now waiting to hear if it can be tested before he is put to death on November 9.

A hearing today could allow the testing - which may ultimately prove his innocence or guilt.

Skinner was convicted in 1995 of killing his live-in girlfriend Twila Busby, 40, and her two adult sons, Randy Busby, 20, and Elwin Caler, 22, in 1993.

About three hours after their bodies were discovered, police found Skinner hiding in a closet in the home of a woman he knew.

Tests showed that blood of at least two victims was on him, and authorities said a trail of blood led police from the bodies to his hiding place a few blocks away.

Skinner has acknowledged being inside the house where the killings took place. But he has argued his innocence from the start, saying that he was too inebriated from drinking vodka and taking codeine to overpower the trio.

He has claimed it was Twila Busby's now-deceased uncle Robert Donnell who carried out the murders.

On Death Row: Hank Skinner is being held at the Texas State Penitentiary at Huntsville

DNA evidence presented at his trial showed his blood was at the scene. But not all the DNA was tested.

A rape kit, biological material from 
his girlfriend's fingernails, sweat from a manâ€™s jacket resembling one 
that another potential suspect often wore, a bloody towel and knives 
were all missed.

Going against his lawyer's wishes, 
Skinner has repeatedly asked the state to release the evidence for 
testing, but Texas courts have repeatedly rejected his pleas.

They said that, as a convicted man, he did not have the right for it to be tested.

But in 2010, less than an hour before he was scheduled to be executed, and after he had eaten his last meal, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed his killing,

It said he could pursue a civil rights claim to obtain the DNA testing, and sent the case back to the federal district court to decide whether Skinner is entitled to additional DNA testing.

His lawyers will today ask federal Magistrate Judge Clinton Averitte in Amarillo to force prosecutors to turn over the knives and clothing that were never tested for DNA.

A decision could be expected soon, but it could be too late for Skinner, who is held at the Texas State Penitentiary at Huntsville.

Although one of his 
lawyers has said he believes the new execution date is 'an effort to put
pressure on the court to act quickly'.

The decision to schedule his execution, rather than wait until the outcome of the ruling that could eventually prove his innocence, has angered civil rights activist Mary Shaw.

She said: 'What are they afraid of - the possibility that Skinner's conviction might be proven wrong?

'Killing a prisoner, apparently, is more important to them than killing the right prisoner. Killing a prisoner, apparently, is more important to them than true justice.'

Skinner's case has echoes of Texas death row prisoner Cameron Todd Willingham who was executed in 1994 for an alleged arson that claimed the lives of his three daughters in 1991.

A later forensic review of the case led to the conclusion that 'a finding of arson could not be sustained.'
