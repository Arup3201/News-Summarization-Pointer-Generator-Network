Their job might not be very pretty, but without them, Bangkok would be overflowing with sewage.

Thai council labourers have to regularly clean the fast-flowing drains that criss-cross underneath roads and buildings in the city using just a bucket and their bare hands.

If the build-up of sludge and debris is not cleared away often enough, the city is at risk of flooding.

The workers have no other method to remove the waste other than climb into the waterways and fill up buckets with black muck and lift them out using simple contraptions.

Worst job ever: A council labourer attaches a bucket of sludge, removed by hand from an underground sewer canal, to a lifting contraption in Bangkok, Thailand

Someone's got to do it: The fast-flowing drains are regularly cleaned by hand and bucket with workers climbing into the many waterways

Today, labourers climbed into an underground canal that acts as a sewer and stormwater drain under a main road in the Thai capital in their latest cleaning operation.

Bangkok's drainage system has long caused problems for residents. 

In 2012, after a heavy bout of rainfall, rubbish and sand clogged the city's sewers causing floods. 

As a result, the city's Corrections Department sent 40 prisoners to clean a seven kilometre section of sewers.
