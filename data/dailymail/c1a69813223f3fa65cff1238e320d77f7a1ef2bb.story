The fired chief of staff for Tennessee Senator Lamar Alexander will live with his parents in Maryland and be electronically monitored while he awaits trial on charges of possession and attempted distribution of child pornography.

A federal judge allowed Ryan Loskarn to be released from custody after a hearing Monday.

Loskarn's lawyers argued that the 35-year-old had no prior convictions or arrests and that he should be freed. Prosecutors opposed the request.

Magistrate Judge John Facciola ordered Loskarn to be confined to his parents' home on the monitor.

He also isn't allowed any access to the Internet.

Loskarn's parents appeared in court, 
and his father stood with his arm around his mother as she told the 
judge that they have no home computer and that cellphones and iPads are 
password protected.

They promised to ensure their son would have no access to the Internet. They declined comment after the hearing.

Loskarn was arrested Wednesday and 
faces up to 10 years on the possession charge and a minimum of five and 
maximum of 20 years on the distribution charge.

Loskarn had served as chief of staff for the Republican senator for two years.

Loskarn faces up to 10 years on the possession charge, with no minimum, and five to 25 years on the distribution charge.

According to a filing with the U.S. 
District Court last week, police used a ram to enter Loskarn's home the 
day before, and noticed that he put something on the ledge outside a 
window.

It turned out to a portable hard drive with videos depicting child pornography, according to the filing.

The filing states that in 2010, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and Toronto Police Service were investigating a movie production company, a majority of whose films feature young nude boys, and found that Loskarn had made several purchases from the company in 2010 and 2011.

Then in October of this year, the 
filing said, federal investigators identified Loskarn's residential IP 
address on a peer-to-peer network offering files 'with names that are 
consistent with child pornography broadcasting as a download candidate.'

Loskarn
was a rising star who had spent the past decade working his way up to 
increasingly important posts in the House and then the Senate.

Republican Senator Alexander said in a news release that he was 'stunned, 
surprised and disappointed' by the allegations against his newly 
departed staffer.

Alexander
initially placed Loskarn on unpaid leave, but before the end of the 
day, he had replaced Loskarn with David Cleary, the senator's 
legislative director.

Rep. 
Marsha Blackburn, another Tennessee Republican for whom Loskarn had 
worked as communications director, said she was 'shocked, saddened and 
stunned.'
