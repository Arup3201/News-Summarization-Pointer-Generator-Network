There was no rest for Jose Mourinho's Chelsea as they were put through their paces on Monday after the FA Cup humiliation against Bradford City on Saturday. 

The Premier League leaders, who have looked so imperious for the majority of this season, were shocked 4-2 by the League One giant-killers at Stamford Bridge, after blowing a two-goal lead.

But they must lock that painful experience away ahead of the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg against Liverpool on Tuesday.

Chelsea are still in with a shout of winning the Capital One Cup and face Liverpool in the semi-final 

The tie is delicately poised at 1-1 after the first leg at Anfield and the Blues will look to bounce back after Saturday's shock result. 

Diego Costa looks primed and ready to play some part against the Reds after being pictured training with the rest of the first-team squad.

And manager Mourinho knows the high importance of the game against Brendan Rodgers' side.

'The next game is the most important one,' he told chelseafc.com. 'We need to forget this one (Bradford) and start the next game in a different competition, and I know we are one victory away from playing a final.

'It's the good thing about playing consecutive matches without many days in between. It's the good thing that, when you lose, you have to focus immediately on the next game.

'You don't have a lot of time to be moaning or analysing what happened in the bad one. Let's move and let's think about the next one.

With the FA Cup exit meaning Chelsea's dreams of a quadruple are now over, the Blues will set their sights on the treble instead

 Chelsea midfielder Fabregas has been in superb form this season 

'At the end of May, beginning of June, we don't go to Wembley to play the FA Cup final, that's for sure.

'The FA Cup is finished for us. We don't go there even to play the FA Cup semi-final. It's over for us.

'To go there - and I think that should mean a lot to everyone - the last chance we have is this one, to play there in the Capital One Cup final.'
