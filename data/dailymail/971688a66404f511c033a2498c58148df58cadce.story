Andrew Moran was sentenced in Madrid today after he pleaded guilty to drugs, firearms and road traffic offences while he was on the run

One of Britain's most wanted fugitives has been jailed in Spain for six years and six months.

Andrew Moran, 31, of Salford, was sentenced in Madrid today after he pleaded guilty to drugs, firearms and road traffic offences while he was on the run.

He had been on Crimestoppers' most wanted list of criminals, who were at large in the country.

Moran flew out of Manchester Airport on a false passport the following day after he escaped custody at Burnley Crown Court in March 2009 where he was eventually convicted in his absence of conspiracy to commit armed robbery.

Moran, of Wellbeck Grove, Higher Broughton, had been the gunman in a raid on a Royal Mail van outside the Asda supermarket in Colne, Lancashire, where Â£25,000 was stolen.

A joint operation was launched by Titan (the North West Crime Regional Unit), the National Crime Agency (NCA) and the Spanish national police to locate him.

In November 2012, Moran was said to have displayed 'a spectacular piece of behaviour' when he evaded arrest from the Spanish authorities as they set up an armed security cordon around his then flat.

He smashed his 4x4 vehicle through the police block and then sped off along the wrong way of the motorway.

Evidence of a luxury lifestyle was 
uncovered when officers searched his address, as well as loaded 
firearms, a stash of cannabis and a series of false identity documents.

He was finally detained in a raid at a luxury villa in Alicante in May last year.

Dramatic footage of the arrest was released, which saw Moran trying to jump over a wall after officers interrupted him relaxing by the pool with friends.

Lancashire Police said Moran will be produced back to the UK after serving his jail term in Spain and will then be sentenced for the armed robbery and escaping from lawful custody.
