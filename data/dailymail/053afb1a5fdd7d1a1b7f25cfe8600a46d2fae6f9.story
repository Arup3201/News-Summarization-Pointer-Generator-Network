Hopping mad or toadly awesome? A Japanese nature museum is launching a bizarre menu to celebrate the opening of their Deadly Poison Exhibition. 

The 'Frog Menu' signature dish will feature a deep fried amphibian, sandwiched between a black bun burger, complete with legs dangling out the side.

Guests will be able to see 25 live different poisonous animals from around the world at Orbi Yokohama, in South Toyko, before heading to the cafe to devour a frog of their own.

Tastes like chicken? Frog burgers to be the dish of the day at Orbi Yokohama's new poisonous animals exhibition

Frog legs have long been a delicacy in France, watch this space to see if the burger variety follows suit

The limited edition dish can be bought  for the tempting price of 1,000 yen (around £4.50).

Thankfully the frog is less toxic than its exhibition counterparts, and the black bun can be attributed to a bamboo charcoal dye. 

Orbi Yokohama is not the first place to use the dark bun, with Burger King in Japan launching a range  in 2014.

If the protruding legs of this dish are enough to put you off, guests can always sample the tamer Frog Egg Sweet for 580 yen (£3.17).

This dessert dish incorporates a family theme, with a frog and 'spawn' - thankfully only made out of almond tofu and jelly. 

Sega and the Sunshine Aquarium have teamed up to bring the exhibition to the museum in Yokohama from March 21 to May 17. 

The Frog Egg Sweet dessert includes a frog and eggs. The dish costs 580 yen (£3.17) and thankfully is only made out of almond tofu and jelly. 

Other poisonous animals at the exhibition include spiders, stingrays, puffer fish and other animals. 

Admission to Orbi is 600 yen (£3.28), frog burger not included.
