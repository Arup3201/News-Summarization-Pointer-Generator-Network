Travel experts in the US are predicting a six-year high for the number of flights taken this summer.

Around 210 million - 2.28 million a day - holidaymakers and business flyers are expected to take a plane trip on US carriers between June 1 and August 31.

It will be a rise of 1.5 per cent compared to last summer and the highest level since 2008, according to the trade and lobbying group, Airlines for America.

Airline passengers are increasingly satisfied with their flights, according to a new US airline satisfaction study

The forecast includes 29.9 million travellers - or 325,000 a day - flying US airlines to international destinations, an all-time high.

Canada, Mexico, the UK, Germany and Japan are the top five nonstop international destinations, based on published schedules.

And, despite rising airline ticket prices and fees for everything from checked bags to changed flights, airline passengers are increasingly satisfied with their flights, according to the 2014 North America Airline satisfaction study.

Passenger satisfaction measured at a record high 712 points on a scale of 1,000 - a 17-point increase from 2013.

The airline study measures satisfaction with North American airlines based on seven criteria in order of importance: costs and fees; in-flight services; boarding, deplaning and baggage; flight crew, aircraft; check-in; and reservations.

Satisfaction with costs and fees rose from 618 last year to 642 this year.

Airlines are expecting more passengers to fly this summer than ever before

Alaska Airlines continued to rank first among North American legacy carriers, increasing its customers' satisfaction by 20 points to 737 points, followed by Delta Air Lines (693 points) and American Airlines (684 points).

The average rating for the legacy carriers was 683 points out of a possible 1,000. Air Canada came in fourth with 683 points, followed by United Airlines (658 points) and US Airways (656 points).

Customers prefer the low-cost carriers over the legacy carriers, awarding them an average of 763 points out of a possible 1,000 points.

JetBlue Airways dominated the low-cost category, ranking first for the 10th consecutive year, with 789 points out of a possible 1,000 points. Southwest Airlines came in second place (778 points), followed by WestJet in third place (734 points).

Despite these improvements in customer satisfaction, airlines don't do so well when compared with other industries it appears.

Comparing airlines' average 712-point satisfaction, hotels (777 points), rental cars (775 points) and even mortgage lenders (771 points) do better in customer satisfaction, according to J.D. Power surveys on the same 1,000 scale.Â
