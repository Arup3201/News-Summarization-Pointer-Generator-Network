The iconic Caledonian Sleeper train service between Fort William in the Scottish Highlands and London has been named as one of the best six railway adventures in the world.

The service, which is known as The Deerstalker, has been placed in the same group of great train rides as The Shanghai Maglev, the Tren Crucero through the heart of Ecuador, the Sunset Limited between Los Angeles and New Orleans, the TranzAlpine Express in New Zealand's stunning South Island and the Danube Express between Budapest and Istanbul.

Top travel guide Travel said the Caledonian Sleeper was one of the world's 'most unforgettable train adventures.'

The Caledonian Sleeper train service between London and Fort William named one of the best railway adventures in the world from travel guide, Travel. Pictured: a train crossing the Glenfinnian Viaduct in Scotland

The train journey takes visitors to the picturesque Loch Lomond and Loch Treig (seen here)

The sleeper service also travels across Rannoch Moor (pictured) to the west of Loch Rannoch

'There are only two sleeper services left in the UK, one of them wending its way slowly from London to Penzance. This 13-hour route is the more stunning... hurtling through the night and hitting Edinburgh in the early hours so you can peek at a city waking up,' it says.

'From here it's non-stop on the sensational photo opps: misty Loch Lomond cradled by mountains; the wildly beautiful expanse of wind-blown Rannoch Moor.

'At old Victorian station platforms, lonely tearooms survey the tracks. Beyond, velvety green hills are washed with weak sun.

'Go in spring, when the light and flowers lend the surroundings extra special beauty - and be prepared for a tight squeeze, as the cabins aren't very spacious.'

The guide recommends that passengers watch out for Rannoch Station - gateway to the wild moor, which is 'so remote that rail is pretty much the only way to get there.'

'Your nose will be superglued to the window as you take in the faded purple heathland and the chiffon-like silhouettes of foggy hills beyond,' it says

And the guide adds: 'If you opt for a bargain first class ticket, you'll get your own cabin and wake to breakfast delivered by your own on-board steward, so there's no need to fear stale teacakes and over-brewed tea.'

The journey from Fort William to Mallaig is also widely considered one of Britain's most scenic areas

Other top train journey options include The Magnetic Levitation Train in Shanghai, China

The Tren Crucero, which runs through the heart of Ecuador, also topped Travel's list of the best railways

The  Caledonian Sleeper connects London Euston nightly - except Saturday - to Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Fort William, Glasgow and Inverness, as well as intermediate stations.

But it was the route to Fort William that won over Travel's train lovers.

As of May 2014, Serco have taken over the franchise from the Aberdeen-based First Group.

The company already offers luxury sleeper services in Australia. The new 15-year franchise will start in April 2015.

Serco will be responsible for operating all aspects of the Caledonian Sleeper including marketing, sales, passenger services, station facilities and fleet maintenance.

More than £100m will be invested into building 72 state of the art carriages, which will make up four new trains, at a cost of £100m by the summer of 2018.

It will be part-funded by a £60m grant from the Scottish government. 

The TranzAlpine Express is likewise not to be missed. This train runs along New Zealand's South Island

In America, climb aboard the Sunset Limited between Los Angeles and New Orleans, says the travel guide

Serco is promising improvements including en-suite berths, 'pod flatbeds' and a brasserie-style club car.

And a partnership with luxury hospitality firm Inverlochy Castle Management International and Michelin-starred chef Albert Roux will introduce what is described as 'hotel-style service and an improved all-round travelling experience.'

Announcing the new contract earlier this year, Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said the aim was to 'transform this iconic rail service.'

He added: 'The contract secures the future of the Caledonian Sleeper, ensuring it delivers a service fit for the 21st century and that it provides - as it has done for over 100 years - a unique, valued and high profile overnight service between Scotland and London.'

Around 270,000 journeys were made on the sleeper service in the last year alone. 

Just sold to Serco, the Caledonian Sleeper is set to undergo improvements to the tune of a £100m investment

But Rail workers union the RMT has said it is 'deeply concerned' that the contract had been given to Serco.

Acting General Secretary Mike Cash said: 'This is a company with a truly shocking track record in the delivery of public services.

'Quite frankly, with their appalling list of failures in the UK and globally, they should never have even been considered as contenders for the Scottish sleeper service.

'The logical option of public ownership was not even looked at.

'Serco is a company that has a reputation for promising the earth and delivering quite the opposite as they seek to maximise profits and sweat their assets for every single penny piece.'
