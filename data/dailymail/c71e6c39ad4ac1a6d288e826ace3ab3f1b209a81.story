Posh students at Scotland's top 
university have posted a controversial video of themselves online pouring hundreds of pounds worth 
of champagne over their heads.

The YouTube footage shows a group of well-dressed young 
men from St Andrews University decadently drenching themselves in £25 bottles of Moet Chandon.

In total, 25 bottles of bubbly can be counted, including a massive magnum - which would cost more than £700 at the tills.

Controversial: Posh students at Scotland's top university have posted a video of themselves pouring hundreds of pounds worth of champagne over their heads. In this picture a student pours Moet over his head

Lavish: The YouTube footage shows a group of well-dressed young men from St Andrews University decadently drenching themselves in £25 bottles of Moet Chandon

Joke: Bottles of Moet are poured over the heads of these students on The West Sands in St Andrews in a scene mimicking Chariots of Fire

For the majority of hard-pressed students, £700 would cover at least two month's rent.

The university - where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met as students - was last month slammed for admitting a just tiny percentage of young people from impoverished backgrounds.

Set to a soundtrack which features music from US rapper Kanye West, who often boasts about his wealth, the video begins with a male student entering his local Tesco supermarket and walking past the milk aisle - a nod to the recent 'Milking' craze at Edinburgh University, in which undergrads covered themselves in pints of the white stuff.

The curly-haired St Andrews student then stops beside bottles of vintage port - which costs around £7 - but shakes his head in an apparent boast that he can afford better.

He is seen picking up the pricey bottle of Moet before promptly emptying it over himself outside the shop in front of crowds of people.

The remainder of the three minute 39 second video - which was taken down from YouTube early this evening - features a number of similarly daft clips of the young men wasting the pricey fizz.

Getting ready: A group of students are pictured gathering with their bottles of champagne on St Andrews Pier

Soaking: The group then take their robes off and douse themselves in the champagne

Jump: The group them leap off the pier with the bottles in their hands

Locations used include the Swilken Bridge on the town's famous Old Course, outside the university library, on the steps of the student union, outside University Hall, in the famous St Salvator's Quad, on the pier in their famous tomato-coloured gowns which they then remove and jump, and in the busy High Street.

One young man is even filmed pouring a £80 magnum of champagne over his naked body in a bubble bath.

Seven of the lads recreate the renowned scene from film Chariots of Fire on St Andrews' West Sands - running along the shore pouring champers over their heads to the film's Academy Award-winning original soundtrack composed by Vangelis.

Expensive: In total, 25 bottles of bubbly can be counted, including a massive magnum - which would cost in excess of £700 at the tills

Landmark: This student stands on the famous Swilken Bridge on The Old Course at St Andrews

It's not known whether the magnum was a full new bottle at the start of the prank, but the standard-sized bottles are clearly genuine.

St Andrews University - which has Scotland's toughest entry requirements - was criticised earlier this year after admitting just 14 students from the 20 most deprived areas in Scotland in 2011.Many of its students come from Britain's top public schools.

But in sharp retort last month, the university said that it expected 'to face a considerable and continuing challenge to widen access, because so few young people from Scotland's most deprived areas are achieving basic university entry grades'.

Mocking: The video mocks the recent 'Milking' craze. This image shows a student at Newcastle University pouring milk over his head
