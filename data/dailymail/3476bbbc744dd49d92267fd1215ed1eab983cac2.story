Ronald Koeman has backed his new goalkeeper Fraser Forster to snatch the England No 1 shirt from Joe Hart by impressing at Southampton.

The Saints boss has been working with Forster for less than a week since the 26-year-old completed a £10million from Celtic - but already ranks him as having the ability to succeed Hart between the sticks.

The Manchester City stopper faces a battle for his place at club level with Willy Caballero this summer and Koeman is backing Forster to shake up the order with the national team too - starting away at Liverpool on Sunday.

Lion's roar: Koeman reckons Forster could give Roy Hodgson something to think about in goal

'It's a big challenge to play in the Premier League but, if he well, it's easier to be first choice for England,' Koeman said.

'He's got a good personality. He's very tall. If you see him in goal you'd think it's difficult to beat him. He's also a very good passer,' Koeman said in The Sun.

Forster made it into Roy Hodgson's England squad this summer but didn't make it on to the field as the Three Lions crashed out in the group stage.

England face Norway on September 3 in a friendly before opening up their Euro 2016 qualifying against Switzerland the week after.

That leaves Forster with not much time to impress Hodgson if he wants to steal a spot in the side for the qualifying games - but a good performance at Anfield would go some way to proving his worth. 

Not cheap: Forster signed from Celtic, where he gained Champions League experience, for £10million
