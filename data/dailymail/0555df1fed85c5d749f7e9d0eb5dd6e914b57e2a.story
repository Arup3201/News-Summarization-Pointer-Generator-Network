The cost of an average home will be close to £800,000 by the year 2040, it has been revealed today.

The figure was produced using a formula based on government data which included housing forecasts and future housing inflation.

It predicts that a child aged six today would have to pay out an average of £780,000 to get the keys to a new property in 26 years time.

The cost of an average home will be close to £800,000 by the year 2040, according to an influential think tank

The statistics were produced by the think-tank The Policy Exchange which based its calculations on how much a house currently priced at £244,000 would set a buyer back in 2040 - given the average age of a first time buyer is currently 32.  

The Telegraph reports this morning that the organisation produced the figures as part of its claims that extra homes needed to be built in ‘garden cities’ around Britain.

It comes after the think tank backed the Wolfson Economics Prize where architects were encouraged to submit proposals for garden cities.

The house price forecast for 2040 was inspired by the fact a six-year-old boy had entered the competition, which was eventually won by design consultancy Urbed.

The organisation's head of housing and planning, Chris Walker, told the Telegraph: ‘House prices are on average ten times higher than earnings in Britain.

‘This widens the gap between rich and poor, young and old, north and south. The situation is socially divisive and economically dangerous.

‘Even those who have enjoyed seeing the value of their home increase are now beginning to worry about how their children will be able to afford a home.’

It comes on the day that a banking body warned soaring house prices would mean a generation of buyers will only be able to buy a fraction of their home.

The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said many buyers will be forced into shared ownership deals, where the rest of their property is owned by housing associations or local developers.

They then have to pay rent on the part they do not own.

These deals are already common in parts of the country where house prices are high. But a report from the organisation said in future this could be a way of life for many.

A CML spokesman said: ‘Affordability pressures may mean that, for some, full ownership is not an option, even in the long term.’

The CML added that more action was needed from the Government to solve the housing crisis.

Paula Higgins, of the Homeowners Alliance, said: ‘This is a wake-up call for the Government to help those frozen out of the housing market. Owning a fraction of a home is not the solution, instead it is storing up problems for the future. 

'It will be deeply sad for parents to see their children unable to afford to buy a home of their own even when they are in their 30s and 40s.’

Housing minister Brandon Lewis said home ownership was at its most affordable since 2007. ‘Shared ownership is just one of many options available to aspiring homeowners,’ he added.
