Radio 1 breached standards by allowing singers Lily Allen and Ed Sheeran to swear during a pre-watershed broadcast, watchdog Ofcom ruled yesterday.

The BBC is now set to put up signs in dressing rooms warning stars performing live that they will be pulled off air if they use foul language.

The clampdown comes after Miss Allen said ‘f***’ six times in her set at the Big Weekend Festival in May, broadcast on Radio 1 from 5.30pm to 6.15pm.

BBC said it had considered cutting away from Allen's set twice during her performance, but a senior producer decided to continue because apologies had been given and it was believed that few children would be listening

It emerged the corporation knew Miss Allen planned to sing songs with explicit lyrics but assumed she would ‘self-edit’ out offensive language.

The BBC said it twice considered cutting away from her but that a producer thought few children would be listening and that there had been adequate warnings.

Bosses admitted this was a mistake, telling Ofcom it should have stopped broadcasting after Miss Allen’s second song and aired the rest after editing out any swearing. 

According to BBC figures, 654,000 listeners tuned in for the set – well before the 7pm radio watershed – including around 25,600 aged between 10 and 14.

Before Miss Allen took to the stage, presenter Scott Mills warned listeners her songs could contain foul language. He apologised each time she swore and after the performance. Ed Sheeran also said ‘f******’ on stage.

Ed Sheeran said 'f*****g' just before 7pm in the Glasgow show but the BBC said swear words were 'relatively rare' and were always followed by an immediate apology, while Ofcom said Allen was known to use strong language and 'it was reasonably predictable that her set could contain the most offensive language', it ruled

The BBC has been deluged with complaints over a ‘hatchet job’ Panorama episode about Ukip.

The programme, which was broadcast last week, contained a raft of allegations about the party and its leader Nigel Farage, who was described as ‘back-stabbing’.

In the following days, the BBC received some 800 complaints accusing it of bias, according to its programme Points of View.

Viewers described the report, entitled The Farage Factor and fronted by Darragh MacIntyre, as ‘mud- slinging’, and ‘a hatchet job’, with one commenting: ‘It’s no surprise Nigel Farage refused to be interviewed. Surely every story has two sides?’

Ukip pointed out that many of the report’s allegations, such as questions over party funds, had first appeared several years ago.

In a voice-over, Mr MacIntyre said Ukip ‘preaches accountability so why are they so careful about what questions they answer?’ 

He added: ‘Nigel Farage says he’s a straight talker so why have so many colleagues quit in disgust?’

Interviewee Dr Richard North, Ukip’s director of research from 1999 to 2003, said: ‘He’s socially very skilled ... but behind your back he’ll be stabbing you. Brutus has got nothing on Farage.’

Panorama editor Ceri Thomas said staff had ‘tried our very best to make this a balanced, fair, impartial programme’ even though Mr Farage refused to participate.

The BBC insisted artists were reminded not to swear and that many changed songs accordingly. It claimed it sought to give ‘adequate warnings’ about expletives.

But Ofcom said it was ‘concerned [the BBC] did not take more measures … to ensure compliance [with broadcasting guidelines] … when children were particularly likely to be listening’. The BBC Trust said the incident was a ‘serious breach’ of editorial guidelines.

It added that Radio 1 will likely add signs to stars’ dressing rooms saying ‘strong language will result in your performance being dropped from Radio 1’s live coverage’.
