Police have released two surveillance videos that show a gunman just minutes before he shot dead three women and left another fighting for her life at a Florida hair salon.

The footage of Bradford Baumet, who turned the gun on himself after the shooting spree on Thursday, comes as police link the man to a fourth killing.

Baumet, 36, stormed the Las Dominicanas M & M Hair Salon in Casselberry at 11am shooting dead one customer and two salon employees.

His estranged girlfriend and salon manager, Marcia Santiago, who was scheduled to appear in court for a domestic violence case against the man that day, was left severely wounded and remains in hospital. Baumet then shot himself dead at a friend's home nearby.

Newly obtained footage from security cameras at the Metro PCS store next door shows the gunman calmly walking to the salon and then running away less than a minute later, after the slayings.

Killer: Bradford Baumet, 36, opened fire inside a Casselberry hair salon, wounding his ex-girlfriend and gunning down two other women

The Metro PCS staff are seen peering out the door and then running for cover inside the store when they hear gunfire.

A second video shows Baumet in a McDonald's drive-through half an hour before the shooting took place.

As they release the footage, police have also linked Baumet to the death of 28-year-old Roberto Colon, whose car he had stolen and was driving on the day of the shootings.

Officers found Colon dead inside his home on Friday night after neighbours asked police to check on him.

Authorities haven't confirmed whether they believe Baumet was responsible for Colon's death and it remains unclear whether or how the pair knew each other.

'It's a tragedy,' neighbour Miguel Torres told WDBO. 'When they told me about it, I felt bad, though, because he never looked for trouble with nobody. Everybody liked him.'

Neighbours also told the TV channel that Colon was a friendly man who often lent his cars to people.

Baumet shot dead the three women, including one who was five months pregnant, before turning the gun on himself on Thursday.

Investigators say the gunman opened fire mid-morning in the Casselton Corners plaza shopping mall.

Baumet’s 
ex-girlfriend, Ms Santiago, 44, who managed the salon was shot five times, according to her ex-husband, William Ayala. Ayala said he had a daughter with Santiago and the girl lived with him.

'I heard he was violent and had a criminal record,' he said.

Both she and 
the owner, Eugenia Marte, had filed domestic violence injunctions 
against Baumet in recent weeks.

Santiago
was scheduled to appear in court at 1.30pm on Thursday for a domestic 
violence case, during which a judge would have decided whether to make a
temporary injunction against the man permanent.

Josefa Herrera, Marte’s mother, told the Orlando Sentinel her daughter was among the dead.

She also added that she had warned both Marte and Santiago to be cautious with Baumet because he would harm them.

Dominicanas
employee Noelia Gonzalez, 28, who was five months pregnant, was shot dead along with salon customer Gladys Cabrera, 52, of Orlando.

One witness, who didn’t want to be identified, said the gunman was her family member and may have had some mental problems.

'My
cousin, he’s been having problems. He’s mentally, like, not there. 
We’ve been telling them to keep away from him, keep away from him. Get a
restraining order,' the woman said.

Records in Florida and Rhode Island 
show Baumet has been previously arrested for domestic assault, felony 
assault, stalking, burglary and drug possession.

The wounded victim was taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center in serious condition, Bay News 9 reported.

Casselberry Police spokeswoman Sara Brady said two other women who were at the salon at the time managed to escape unharmed.

The women hid inside a bathroom and one ran outside through a back door.

Juan Diaz, who works at the nearby Metro PCS store, recounted to the Orlando Sentinel how he and his customers heard gunshots at around 11am and saw the gunman as he left the salon.

'We saw the guy with the gun in his hand…..coming this way…on foot with the gun in his hand.

'When
we realized the guy was gone … we went in the hair salon. And once we 
were in the hair salon we just saw a bunch of dead bodies,' Diaz said.

According to police, Baumet was found
with a fatal self-inflicted gunshot wound at a friends' house in a 
residential area of Winter Park about five miles from the shopping 
center.

Seminole County Sheriff's deputies said he told friends: 'I have problems I cannot remedy,' before shooting himself inside the property.

The shooter appeared anxious and agitated when arrived at the home in the 1300 block of Paradise Lane, telling the couple who lived there that he had some problems he could not remedy, police said.

Shortly after, Baumet  committed suicide without revealing to his friends what he had done. Three people were at the house at the time of the shooting.

Baumet had had many 
run-ins with the law in the past, with dozens of arrests in Florida and 
Rhode Island, for charges that ran the gamut from making obscene phone 
calls to stalking and burglary.

As recently as last Sunday, the 36-year-old was in police custody for 
allegedly operating a vehicle with a suspended license. He pleaded no 
contest and was sentenced to time-served and a fine.

In 2004, Baumet was arrested on charges of stalking and burglary. He 
pleaded no contest, spent a short time behind bars and got two years of 
probation.

That same year, a woman filed a domestic violence injunction against 
Baumet in Broward County. Earlier this year in Seminole County, Baumet 
was sentenced to nearly a year in jail after pleading no contest to 
selling pirated music CDs, according to court documents cited by the 
Sentinel.

Orange County court 
records show that on October 5, Baumet drove to the Casselberry salon, 
banged on the locked door and threatened to kill the women inside.

Just days later, both Marte and Santiago filed and obtained temporary injunctions against Baumet.

‘I am scared and feel my life is in danger,’ Santiago wrote in her injunction application.

Santiago also told the court about previous incidents, where Baumet manhandled her, forced her to have sex and made threats on her life.

‘I did not file right away because Brafort [sic] threatened me that if I file an injunction that he will kill me,’ Santiago stated. ‘I got scared.’

Shortly after the shooting, about two dozen mourners gathered near the salon, located in a strip mall.

Police taped off the parking lot and officers stood guard outside the business. Yellow paper covered up some of the glass windows. A Dominican Republic flag hung in the storefront along with a neon sign that read: Hair Cut. Color. Perm.

According to the Orlando Sentinel, the shooting spree was the second time in three weeks that men hunted down their former girlfriends at central Florida workplaces and shot multiple people, then killed themselves.
