Another week, and another set of barely believable unemployment figures.

A crucial government report released today showed a dramatic drop in the number of people filing jobless claims to the lowest level since February 2008. . . but it soon emerged one major state's figures weren't added to the total.

The Obama administration hailed a shock drop of 30,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 339,000, but one Labor Department official let slip that the figures may have fallen because the state, not officially named failed to turn over its figures which in turn were not added to the report.

Just last week monthly unemployment figures showed a shock fall which led some, including former CEO of General Electric Jack Welch to claim that they were 'downright implausible' and issued to improve Obama's economic record just ahead of the election.

Some experts have speculated that the omitted state is California and it will surely add to the growing perception that unemployment figures can't be trusted.

Welch created a furore last week when he 
tweeted that the sharp drop in the unemployment rate  was 'unbelievable"
and that Obama and his campaign aides 'will do anything ... can't 
debate so change numbers'.

On the jobs figures, which were above 8 
per cent for Obama's entire term until Friday, Welch said in a piece in the Wall Street Journal yesterday that there was a 
strong possibility of 'subjectivity creeping into the process'.

'The economy is not in a free-fall. 
Oil and gas are strong, automotive is doing well and we seem to be 
seeing the beginning of a housing comeback. But I doubt many of us know 
any businessperson who believes the economy is growing at breakneck 
speed, as it would have to be for unemployment to drop to 7.8% from 8.3%
over the course of two months.'

He accused the Obama campaign of being disingenuous and the media of being its lapdogs.

The mystery state did report their 
weekly jobless claims, but did not process in time the quarterly claims,
which is when people re-apply for benefits for administrative 
reasons as opposed to having recently lost their job.

Because the state did not hand in the higher quarterly numbers, there wasn't the expected spike in claims that normally occurs at the start of a quarter but in fact, a fall.

This also means that should the state file their full and correct figures in time for next week, the tally of jobless claims is likely to rise next week, negating any good news from today.

But California 'provided all required'
claims data on a 'timely' basis to the Labor Department, Dan Stephens, a
spokesman for California’s Employment Development Department, said in 
an e-mail to Bloomberg.

Initially the figures were seen as a boost to President Obama's 
re-election effort.

They showed the number of Americans seeking unemployment aid 
surprisingly plummeted last week to a seasonally adjusted 339,000, the 
lowest level since February 2008.

The sharp drop, if sustained, could signal a stronger job market.

The fall was a shock to analysts and investors and offered a hopeful sign that the job market could be picking up as firms feel confident enough to keep workers in employment.

The news has come the week after the unexpectedly upbeat and widely questioned September
employment report from the Department of Labor which showed 
unemployment falling below eight percent for the first time since 
President Obama entered the Oval Office.

The Labor Department said on Thursday
that weekly applications fell by 30,000 to the fewest since February 
2008. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, dropped by 11,500 
to 364,000, a six-month low.

Weekly applications are a proxy for 
layoffs. They can fluctuate sharply from week to week. If they stay near
last week's level, it would likely signal better hiring ahead.

'The overall trend seems to be that the labor market is improving,' said
Brian Kim, a currency strategist at RBS Securities in Stamford, 
Connecticut.

However, the 
figures can also indicate that people are leaving the workforce entirely
and no longer attempting to even find work anymore.

When applications consistently drop below 375,000, it suggests that hiring is strong enough to lower the unemployment rate.

Zach Pandl, strategist at Columbia Management in Minneapolis, said 'you 
do have to be cautious about possible distortions. But with that caveat,
the jobless claims numbers have been modestly encouraging over the last
few weeks.'

The positive figures follow a government surprisingly upbeat September employment report.

The report said the unemployment rate fell in September to 7.8 percent, from 8.1 percent in August. It was the first time the rate had dropped below 8 percent since January 2009.

Taken with the unemployment figures the latest data has offered a hopeful sign that the moribund
job market could pick up and provides Mr. Obama with ammunition against
Republican challenger Mitt Romney that his economic policies for 
recovery are bearing fruit.

The unemployment rate declined because a government survey of households found that 873,000 more people had jobs, the biggest jump in nearly 10 years. An increase in part-time employment accounted for most of the gain.

Employers, meanwhile, added 114,000 jobs in September, according to a separate survey of businesses.

And hiring over the summer was stronger than previously estimated. The economy gained an average of 146,000 jobs a month in the July-September quarter. That's more than double the monthly pace in the April-June quarter.

Better-than-usual weather returned construction workers and others back 
to the job, and the end of some union-related labor strikes also reduced
the number of jobless claims, some analysts said.

Still, hiring must be stronger to bring relief to the more than 12 million people who are unemployed.

Roughly 100,000 new jobs are needed each month to keep up with the working-age population.

Another report on Wednesday suggested hiring will likely remain modest.

Employers posted slightly fewer open jobs in August compared with July, the Labor Department said. It was the second straight monthly drop and the fewest openings since April.

A key problem is the economy is not growing fast enough to generate much hiring.

Growth slowed to a tepid annual rate of 1.3 percent in the April-June quarter, down from 2 percent in the previous quarter.

Most economists see growth staying at or below 2 percent in the second half of the year.

On the trade front, exports dropped 1% to $181.3 billion as demand for U.S.-made cars and farm goods declined.

Imports
edged down a slight 0.1% to $225.5 billion as purchases of foreign-made
autos, aircraft and heavy machinery fell. The cost of oil imports rose 
sharply.

Obama's administration had rigged the numbers

A wider trade deficit acts as a drag on growth because it
means the U.S. is earning less on overseas sales of U.S.-produced goods
while spending more on foreign products.

Economic growth slowed 
to an annual rate of just 1.3% in the April-June quarter, and most 
economists don't expect the economy to grow by much more than 2% at an 
annual rate the rest of the year.

U.S. manufacturers have been 
hampered by slumping economies in Europe, China and other key export 
markets. Many European countries are recession. The region accounts for 
about one-fifth of U.S. exports.

The International Monetary Fund 
this week projected global growth of just 3.3% for the year and 3.6% in 
2013.

The stunning turn around in the 
unemployment trend has led some to claim the books have been cooked 
after the Obama's debate disaster last week

The number may sound respectable at first glance, but it takes 
into account what is expected to be a sharp drop in China's growth rate 
to well below 10%.

The downgrade from its July forecast reflected
disappointing growth in the U.S., spreading recessions in Europe and a 
marked slowdown in China.

There have been some hopeful signs that 
the U.S. economy is improving. Manufacturing grew in September for the 
first time in four months, according to a closely watched survey from 
the Institute of Supply Management.

The growth was driven by a jump in 
new orders and more hiring.

The unemployment rate declined to 7.8 
percent in September, the lowest level since January 2009. It fell 
because of a huge increase in the number of people who said they found 
jobs.

Increases in major purchases show consumers gaining more 
confidence in the economy. Auto sales rose 13% last month from a year 
earlier to nearly 1.2 million.

Home sales have been posting solid gains,
which have driven home prices higher. When home prices rise, people 
tend to feel wealthier and spend more freely.

Last week the national unemployment rate dropped
to 7.8 per cent in September, edging below eight per cent for the first
time in almost four years and handing President Barack Obama's 
re-election hopes a potentially major boost.

U.S.
Labour Department figures state that employers added 114,000 jobs in 
September as wages rose and more people started looking for work. In 
addition, 86,000 more jobs were created in July and August than first 
estimated.

According to 
James Pethokoukis of the American Enterprise Institute, however, if the 
labour participation rate had remained at the same rate as it was when 
Obama took office, the unemployment rate would be 10.7 per cent.

The figures immediately prompted claims of political manipulation in the wake of a poor debate performance by Obama in Denver.

'Unbelievable jobs numbers..these Chicago
guys will do anything..can't debate so change numbers,' tweeted Jack 
Welch, former CEO of General Electric.

The fall was a surprise to most analysts who suggest and came about because one major state failed to file their complete figures for the last quarter
