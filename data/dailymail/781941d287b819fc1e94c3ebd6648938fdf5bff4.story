Row: Unions are calling for  Bath headteacher Kim Sparling for the culture at the school despite it gaining an outstanding Ofsted rating under her leadership

A headmistress is facing calls to resign despite achieving an ‘outstanding’ Ofsted rating for her school – after inspectors criticised her culture of fear, intimidation and bullying.

Kim Sparling – who took a tough stance on uniform, behaviour and attendance – is said to have left staff feeling threatened and ‘fearful of making any mistake’ after frequent dressing-downs in front of pupils.

Officials sent to Oldfield School in Bath cited ‘very low morale’ among staff and an ‘over-reliance on disciplinary procedures’ to manage them.

Chairman of governors Julie Cope stood down in the wake of their report and the NASUWT union called for the headmistress to resign.

Union spokesman Wendy Exton said: ‘As many of the issues at Oldfield, as alleged in the report, have been due to behaviour from Mrs Sparling, how can we move forward positively while the current head teacher remains?’

The high-flying secondary school, rated ‘outstanding’ in its last full inspection at the end of 2012, has been at the centre of a prolonged row since a snap visit by inspectors in December.

A team from Ofsted spent three days at the academy to carry out a ‘Section 5’ inspection, which are called only when specific concerns are raised.

But the outcome sparked controversy when Ofsted declined to publish its full report and instead released only limited information.

The three-page document focused on the safety of children at the 775-pupil school and concluded that procedures were in order.

It did, however, express concerns 
about the relationship between the governors and Mrs Sparling, and said 
the board did not properly hold her to account when dealing with issues 
such as complaints.

A campaign was launched to release the full 
nine-page report, and it was later published on a charity’s website, 
accusing Mrs Sparling of creating a hostile culture.

Despite
 the ‘significant flaws’, the report praised pupils as highly  motivated
 with an ‘outstanding’ level of achievement.

It said: ‘The head 
teacher’s leadership style intimidates staff, resulting in a climate of 
fear which pervades the school.

Despite very effective teaching, threats
 and bullying are commonplace, with many staff working in fear of losing
 their job.

'Staff feel threatened and are fearful of making any 
mistake.’

It went on: ‘Many
 describe being shouted at in front of other staff and students.’ Ofsted
 has repeatedly refused to answer questions about who decided not to 
publish the full report.

'Neither Mrs Sparling nor her lawyers responded 
to a request for comment.

She is now on sick leave.

Her
 leadership is being investigated by the Department for Education and 
the Education Funding Agency.

Mrs Sparling joined Oldfield in 1998, 
having previously been deputy head at St John’s School in Marlborough.

Over the next few years, she did not shy away from imposing stricter 
rules.

In 2007 Oldfield was 
graded ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted.

But the school has come under increasing
 criticism after parents began to complain that their grievances were 
not taken seriously enough.
