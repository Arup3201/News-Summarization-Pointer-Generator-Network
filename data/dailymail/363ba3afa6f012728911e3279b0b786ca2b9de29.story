An Ohio teen driver and his instructor were killed during a Monday afternoon lesson after the young student drove past a stop sign and was hit by a minivan.

Joseph Franks, 16, was reportedly behind the wheel of while 48-year-old Thomas Smith of Key Driving School instructed him, according to The Toledo Blade. 

Their vehicle drove past a stop sign at a Waterville Township intersection and was hit by the minivan - causing it to move off of the road, flip over and land in a nearby home's front yard. Both were killed at the scene.

Minivan driver Kathleen Woods, 48, was also knocked off the road in her vehicle, and was treated for non-life-threatening injuries, the paper says. All three drivers wore seat belts during the crash.

Neither car seems to have tried to brake. Cars used in driving instruction must have brakes on their passenger sides, where the instructors sit, Lt. Bill Bowers of the Ohio Highway Patrol told the Blade. The car involved in Monday's crash was to be inspected by police as part of their investigation.

The driving school's owner, Bonnie Lech, told the paper the school's cars have the required two sets of brakes, for the driver and the instructor. She said she was waiting for the Highway Patrol's report about the crash to find out what happened.
