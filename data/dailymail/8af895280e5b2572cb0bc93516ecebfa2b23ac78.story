Former show-girl turned Italian MP Nicole Minetti is seen here soaking up the heat in Miami, as she enjoys her Christmas break in the sun.

The 26-year-old former girlfriend of Silvio Berlusconi has recently re-launched her fashion modelling career after being dragged into the playboy's most recent scandals. 

Berlusconi is now threatening a return to politics as he plans to run in the coming Italian elections hoping to gain office for a fourth time.

However, he faces yet more court cases surrounding the use of prostitutes at his so-called Bunga-Bunga parties.

Bilingual Miss Minetti, whose mother Georgina Reed is from Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, treated Berlusconi's broken teeth after he was hit in the face with a statue at a rally in December 2009.

Berlusconi invited her to become a politician and she was shortlisted for the upcoming elections which made her the victim of much criticism.

At a fashion show in September Ms Minetti claimed that fashion and politics were the perfect mix

Berlusconi subsequently appointed her a regional councillor in LombardyShe was also involved in the so-called Caso Ruby scandal and it was discovered that she owned four apartments which were occupied by showgirls.

No stranger to headlines, in 2011 prosecutors asked for her to be charged with recruiting prostitutes for Berlusconi - a probe involving a teenage prostitute allegedly paid for sex by the controversial politician.

Milan prosecutors are also investigating whether she improperly requested state reimbursements for €27,000 (£22,000) in spa treatments, hotels and dinners.

Berlusconi stepped down in November 2011 amid an economic crisis and the growing row over his Bunga Bunga parties.

Since then his Freedom People party has been damaged by repeated sleaze allegations which have toppled regional authorities in Lazio and Lombardy.

Twenty-two regional councillors from the Freedom People and Northern League parties are being investigated over expenses on items including lottery scratch cards, bullets, cigarettes, takeaway pizzas and fireworks.

Berlusconi now faces renewed allegations ahead of the coming elections in February.

Nicole Minetti recently stated that she thought Slivio Berlusconi's new fiancee Francesca Pascale (right) would make an 'excellent first lady'.

The 27-year-old former dancer is now being groomed as the wife of the playboy who is now hoping to run once more for Prime Minister.

Miss Pascale, the daughter of a wedding photographer who grew up in Naples, began dancing for a kitsch show on Telecapri station when she was 14.

She later left showbusiness, studied political science and became a provincial councillor for Mr Berlusconi’s centre-Right PdL party, but stepped down in July.

Earlier this month the billionaire media mogul confirmed their relationship on television, calling her 'beautiful on the inside and the outside'. Miss Pascale is said to be friends with Mr Berlusconi’s daughter, Marina, who is chairman of Italy’s largest magazine publisher, Mondadori.Miss Pascale met Mr Berlusconi in 2004 when she was 19 and has proved a loyal political collaborator.
