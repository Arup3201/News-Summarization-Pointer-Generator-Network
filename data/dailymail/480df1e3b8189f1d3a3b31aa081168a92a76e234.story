Family affair: Sons of Guns, showing the family business Red Jacket Firearms, was axed after rape allegations

Ford and Hayden had both featured on Sons of Guns, an axed Discovery Channel show that followed the Hayden family's gun shop, Red Jacket Firearms.

The program ran for three years, but was cut when rape allegations were made against Will Hayden, the father of the family.

He was accused of raping his twelve-year-old daughter, Hayden's sister, in September and threatening her with violence if she spoke out.

This month he was hit by further rape allegations after a woman, now 34, said Hayden raped her when she was 12.

According to police documents, the woman was staying with the Hayden family after her house had been destroyed in a fire when the alleged abuse took place.

The show was cancelled by Discovery after the allegations were revealed, with a spokesman for the channel citing the 'serious and horrific nature of the charges' against Hayden.
