Likely GOP presidential contender Mike Huckabee lit into President Barack Obama on Monday over remarks he made last week that were critical of Christianity.

'Everything he does is against what Christians stand for, and he's against the Jews in Israel,' Huckabee, who was until recently a Fox News host, said this morning on Fox and Friends.

'The one group of people that can know they have his undying, unfailing support would be the Muslim community. It doesn't matter whether it's the radical Muslim community or the more moderate Muslim community.'

Last Thursday Obama used an address at the National Prayer Breakfast to chastise critics of his administration who have complained that neither the president or his advisers will refer violent extremists waging war in the Middle East in the context of the religion they profess.

Preferring to call them 'terrorists,' Obama's administration has deliberately refused to characterize ISIS and other related groups that seek to impose a caliphate in that region as radical Islamisists.

At the breakfast, which occurred a day after the president held a roundtable with Muslim leaders, Obama urged Christians to get off their 'high horse' and 'remember that during the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ.'

'In our home country, slavery and Jim Crow all too often was justified in the name of Christ,' he added.

The comments have infuriated Republicans - who were already up in arms over Obama's refusal to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a March visit because of the proximity to that country's elections - and talking heads on major networks, including left-leaning channel MSNBC.

Former Virginia governor Jim Gilmore, a Republican, said Obama's remarks were the 'most offensive I’ve ever heard a president make in my lifetime.' 

'He has offended every believing Christian in the United States. This goes further to the point that Mr. Obama does not believe in America or the values we all share,' Gilmore said immediately following the speech, per the Washington Post.

Referencing the murder of Jordanian pilot Muadh al-Kasasbeh at the hands of ISIS, revealed earlier that week, Fox and Friends host Elizabeth Hasselbeck argued on the show Friday, 'Christians had nothing to do with a man being burned alive in a cage we saw on Wednesday that we saw took place last month. 

'Nothing to do it,' she added, angrily. 'Yet he named them, invoked the name of Christ — our savior— three times and talked about Christians but couldn't call radical Islam for what it was, couldn't name the person behind the match.'

MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell said Sunday that she thought it in poor taste for Obama to use the term crusade 'in any context right now.'

'It's too fraught,' she said during an appearance on Meet the Press.

'And the week after a pilot is burned alive in a video shown, you don't lean over backwards to be philosophical about the sins of the fathers,' she asserted.
