Manchester United moved back into the top four of the Barclays Premier League with a 2-1 smash-and-grab raid at Arsenal. 

Antonio Valencia's shot was deflected in off Kieran Gibbs, whose collision with Wojciech Szczesny saw the Arsenal keeper substituted, on 55 minutes before, as the Gunners pressed, Wayne Rooney clipped in a second on the break. Arsenal forward Olivier Giroud marked his return from three months out with a broken ankle by netting a well-struck consolation in stoppage-time.

Sportsmail's Sami Mokbel rates all the players' performances.

ARSENAL (4-3-2-1)

Wojciech Szczesny - 5

Looked comfortable until his calamitous decision to come for Young's cross that led to United's opener and the Pole injuring a rib.

Calum Chambers - 6

Wasn't daunted by the task of shackling Di Maria. Looked a lot more assured than his last run out against Swansea.

Per Mertesacker - 6

Looked more assured than in previous matches, but still needs to improve. His lack of pace was exposed at times.

Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea made a succession of fine saves

Nacho Monreal - 5.5

Again asked to play as a makeshift centre-back. Did a job, but the left-back looks so uncomfortable in the heart of defender.

Kieran Gibbs - 5.5

His lack of communication with Szczensy for United's opener cost Arsenal dear. A big blemish on an otherwise decent display.

Mikel Arteta - 6.5

Quietly went about his business in midfield and played a beautiful ball for Giroud's goal. 6.5

Aaron Ramsey - 5.5

Where are those dazzling midfield displays of last season? Kept things moving but still lacking last year's excellence.

Jack Wilshere of Arsenal has a shot saved by  United goalkeeper De Gea

Jack Wilshere - 7

It's going to be a restless night for the midfielder as he awaits a diagnosis on the ankle injury that saw him limp off.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain - 7.5

A major threat down the right for Arsenal. Blackett had no answer to the England man at times.

Danny Welbeck - 6.5

Inter changed from the left wing to the centre throughout Saturday's clash. Missed two decent chances.

Alexis Sanchez - 6.5

Not up to the standard we've become accustomed, perhaps feeling the effects of the international break. 

Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez put in a lacklustre display after the international break

Subs

Santi Cazorla - 6

Brought on for the injured Wilshere. Couldn't unlock the door.

Emiliano Martinez - 5 

An unexpected substitution following Szczesny's injury. Only thing he really had to do was pick the ball out of the net.

Olivier Giroud - 6.5

Marked his long-awaited return from injury with a goal . Perhaps the only plus point from a miserable day for Arsenal.

Subs not used

Rosicky, Podoloski, Giroud, Cazorla, Flamini, Martinez, Bellerin

Manager 

Arsene Wenger - 5

His side are struggling. Big time. Needs to perk his players up for an important Champions League clash against Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday. 5

MANCHESTER UNITED

David De Gea - 8

Kept his side in the match with vital saves from Welbeck and Wilshere. His team-mates did the rest.

Paddy McNair - 7

The youngster kept his head in the red-hot Emirates Stadium atmosphere. Invaluable experience for the youngster.

Chris Smalling - 7

So often the butt of the joke, but stood strong against Arsenal's attack on Saturday. Big 90 minutes for the defender.

Tyler Blackett - 6.5

Was given a rough ride by Oxlade-Chamberlain at time, but kept plugging away and didn't hide.

United youngster Paddy McNair kept his head in red-hot atmosphere

Antonio Valencia - 7

Tireless work rate down the right and was rewarded as he played a crucial role in United's opener.

Luke Shaw - 5

Lasted less than 20 minutes before being taken off with an injury. Had already been given the run around by Oxlade-Chamberlain.

Marouane Fellaini - 6.5

Brilliant one minute, not very good the next. Can be a key player for Van Gaal if he can find some consistency.

Michael Carrick - 7

Didn't for a minute looked fazed in the heat of battle. Stuck to his passing principles and United looked better for it.

Angel Di Maria had late impact by setting up Rooney for United's second goal

Wayne Rooney - 7

Flitted in and out of the game after his England heroics - but showed utter quality with his finish to kill off Arsenal.

Angel Di Maria - 6.5

Not the most eye-catching of displays but his precision pass set up Rooney's goal.

Robin van Persie - 5.5

Will be pleased with the result, but didn't have the impact he would have liked back at his former club.

United starlet James Wilson will have enjoyed Saturday's experience 

Subs

Ashley Young - 7

Played at left wing back and was excellent throughout. Key role in United's opener.

James Wilson - 6

Will have loved playing in Saturday's atmosphere, even if it was only for 20 minutes or so.

Darren Fletcher - 6

Brought on to sure things up. Experience was vital in a kamikaze final few minutes.

Subs not used

Mata, Januzaj, Lindegaard, Herrera.

Manager 

Louis van Gaal - 7.5

The best 90 minutes for the Dutchman since his arrival. He'll hope this is the start of a new, consistent, United.

Att: 60, 074

MOM: De Gea

Ref: Mike Dean - 7
