The heiress of a £250million family business has quit the company after her plans to turn it into a co-operative were rejected.

Caroline Murphy, a director of construction firm Murphy Group, had decided to hand control of the firm set up by her father to its 3,500-strong work force.

The plan is said to have upset some of her fellow board members, including her mother and two brothers.

She is said to have walked out of the company after fellow executives  baulked at her vision, which is modelled on a Spanish co-operative.

Off: Caroline Murphy has turned her back on her £250m construction business in a row over turning it into a workers' co-op

Miss Murphy, who inherited the company which specialises in civil engineering from her late father, John, said the split was amicable.

She told a newspaper: ‘In every family, on every board, people come with different views.

‘I’ve said I want it to happen and it’s not happening. It’s not something everyone’s agreed to.’ Miss Murphy, 31, has committed to selling her 20 per cent stake in the firm – worth up to £40million – to staff for peppercorn sums.

She believes the co-op experiment is a form of direct democracy under which employees vote on key decisions. Long-serving workers get more shares, while those on low wages pay little for the stock.

Miss Murphy was inspired to adopt the model after a visit to a company called Mondragon, a Spanish workers’ co-op that operates grocery shops, car factories and local banks.

‘On the day we visited, their supermarket workers had just taken a decision – this was people stacking shelves, working on the tills – to work longer hours for no pay increase.

‘That was what they voted for because they understood the competition, the environment their chain was operating in and they could see that was the right decision.’

She says it is a myth that workers with power will always award themselves a pay increase. Another reason for her philosophy is empowering ‘voiceless’ people, she said.

Miss Murphy is a union activist, gay rights advocate and a campaigner against sexual violence.She has in the past written on her blog about her experience of being raped – and the suicide attempts which followed.

‘I get flashbacks,’ she said. ‘One of the symptoms of post-traumatic stress for me was over-activity, over-working. I wanted to work 16 hours a day to keep myself occupied.’

After recovering from a nervous breakdown in 2009, Miss Murphy started work on an MA in violence against women and children.

She also plans to marry her long-term partner later this year.

Her father set up Murphy Group in 1945 to clear bomb sites left by the Blitz. It is a big player in the construction industry and is currently working on the Crossrail project. Miss Murphy said her father, who died in 2009 aged 95, would have approved of her plans.

‘The natural extension of my father’s values, in my view, is the development of the Murphy Group into an employee-owned structure,’ she said.

‘My dad’s view was that you can only wear one pair of shoes at a time.’ She added: ‘People have always had their say within the business but that was very much in the gift of my father, or in my gift. I wanted it not to be in anybody’s gift.’
