A mother has spoken of her heartbreak that her partner will never meet his unborn son, after he died from meningitis.

Marciano Nolan, 46, contracted a rare form of the disease last month but medics dismissed his symptoms as swollen joints and later said it was simply a virus 'doing the rounds'. His condition rapidly deteriorated and he died four days after he first felt ill.

The devoted father leaves behind three children and his partner of 14 years, Clare Streeter, who is 22 weeks pregnant with the couple's fourth child.

She told MailOnline: 'The 20-week scan a couple of weeks ago
broke my heart. I could see the baby's face on the scan and it looked 
exactly like Marciano.

Marciano Nolan, 46, died after contracting a rare form of meningitis that was dismissed as a virus. His partner Clare today spoke of her heartbreak that he will never meet his unborn son (above in an earlier scan)

Mr Nolan leaves behind his partner of 14 years, Clare, and their three children Brendon, 11, Lizzie, 7, and Bella, seven months. Ms Streeter is also expecting the couple's fourth child

'It was like seeing a ghost. He should have been 
there and I am heartbroken he will never meet his little boy.'

Mr Nolan died at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Rhyl, North Wales, on January 6 from meningococcal septicaemia.

Mr Nolan, who worked in the catering industry, fell ill on January 2.  He complained of severe headaches, dehydration and aversion to light as his condition worsened.

The next day, his joints had become swollen and painful, so much so that he was unable to get dressed or brush his teeth.

Ms Streeter, 29, sent him to Glan 
Clwyd’s A&E department in Rhyl, North Wales. She said: 'My friend took him to the accident and emergency 
department who sent him away, as they said he wasn't an emergency. Instead, he was sent to an out of hours doctor.

'The doctor agreed he had swollen joints and sent him home with very strong painkillers.

'He went to bed when he got home and about an hour later, I went up to see if he wanted any food or drink.

Mr Nolan, with eldest son Brendon, was described as a devoted father who worked seven days a week

'He said he had a headache and had didn't want the light on.'

By mid afternoon, Mr Nolan began vomiting for a number of hours.

'I thought it was simply a side-effect of the medication he'd been given,' recalls Ms Streeter.

When his condition began to deteriorate further in the middle of the evening, she dialled 999.

'By the time they arrived, Maz was very confused,
dehydrated and still vomiting and had a temperature of 39.9. It was terrifying,' she said.

'Even then, they were unsympathetic and still didn't want to take him to hospital - they said there were a lot of viruses going around. Eventually, they agreed.

'At 11pm I rang the hospital to see how 
he was and they told me to ring in a couple of hours as he was still 
waiting to be seen.

'By 1am, I just knew something was wrong and rushed up to the hospital, where I saw him being rushed in for a CT scan.

Devoted: Mr Nolan and Ms Streeter with their first son, Brendon, now 11

Happier times: On holiday with daughter Lizzie, 7. Ms Streeter said Mr Nolan did have the classic meningitis rash, but it was masked by his tattoo

'The doctors then came and told me he was in ITU.

'I sat with him all night and they tried so hard to save him, but it was just too aggressive. I could tell he was gone.

Mr Nolan died in the early hours of Sunday, January 6th.

'They told me he had died from meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia and brain stem 
cell damage,' Ms Streeter said.

The couple have three children Brendon, 11, Lizzie, seven, and Bella, just seven months old.

She told MailOnline: 'The
whole family is devastated. I just can't believe I'll never see him 
again and that the children will never see their daddy again.

'He was such a loving father and worked seven days a week to provide for us.'

Mr Nolan had recently become a father to baby Bella, now seven months. Tragically, he will never meet his fourth child, due in June

She is now focusing on helping her children adjust to their devastating loss.

She said: 'I'm just numb at the moment - the kids aren't 
coping well at all, so I'm trying to concentrate on them and get them 
back into a routine.'

In order to try and prevent other families suffering, she has launched a campaign to raise awareness of the symptoms.

Ms Streeter has now launched a 
campaign to raise awareness of the disease, which affects only a handful
of people aged between 40 and 50 each year in England and Wales.

It most commonly affects young children and teenagers.

'I want people to know how serious this infection is and how quickly it can kill. The hospital said it was one of the worst cases they have ever had.'

'One really important thing I've learned is that people need to be much more aware of the other symptoms other than the rash. Maz had one, but it was in between the tattoo on his arm - we didn't spot it for hours until he was lying in hospital,' she said.

'People need to be much more aware of the other symptoms, such as not wanting to be around bright lights.

'Marciano lives on in all of our children and I see him every day through 
them, which brings me great comfort. But I don't want any other families to go through what we've been through.'
