Fears have been raised for the safety of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge after the Queen's representative in New Zealand tweeted exact details of the couple's forthcoming tour.

William and Kate, together with their eight-month-old son George, will jet off next week for their three-week visit to New Zealand and Australia.

However, security arrangements for the trip have come under scrutiny after precise details of where the couple will be visiting, along with timings and maps of their proposed routes, were given out via the New Zealand's Governor General's official Twitter feed.

Security: Fears have been raised for the safety of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their baby son after the Queen's representative in New Zealand tweeted exact details of their forthcoming tour

The account run on behalf of Sir Jerry Mataparae, who acts as the Queen's representative in the country, provided timetables for the couple's visits to cities including Wellington and Christchurch as well as details of where the best place to spot the royals.

But the former Metropolitan Police head of Royal Protection has said the information could leave the couple at risk of an attack by terrorists or stalkers.

'I’m appalled at the idiocy of any idiot who would publish this far 
in advance both route and location,' Dai Davies told the Daily Mirror.

He
 added: 'I find it almost unbelievable someone would do this. It’s a 
manual and it goes against anything I believe in. Appalled is the word.'

Messages
 posted by the account, which were not written by Sir Jerry, included 
one which read: 'The Duke and Duchess and Prince George arrive in 
Wellington at 11.45am, Monday 7 April at the Military Terminal, 
Wellington Airport. The best place to see them is round the bays as they
 drive to Government House.'

Timetable: Although royal engagements are often announced in advance it is very rare for precise timings to be revealed due to security fears

Another said: '#Auckland: Your best spots are down Beaumont/Jellicoe St, and around the harbour for match race sailing!#RoyalVisitNZ'

Detailed maps were also provided for fans.

Although
 royal engagements are often announced in advance it is very rare for 
precise timings to be revealed due to security fears.

Last
 week it was revealed that Al-Qaeda terrorists in Syria have been 
ordered to target the Queen at British sporting events such as Wimbledon
 and Cheltenham races.

FA 
Cup matches are also on the list of recommended events, with 'martyrdom 
bombers' advised to detonate explosives at the final whistle.

In
 a series of recommendations published in the terror group's 
English-language magazine, jihadists were told to act as a 'lone wolf' 
and use car bombs for 'killing individuals'.

Mr Davies said that in 1970 the Queen and Prince Philip were the intended targets of an assassination attempt as they journeyed through the Great Dividing Range in Australia.

He said that those behind the plot had wanted to derail the official train by placing a wooden log over the tracks - which demonstrated why alternative routes were necessary for royal visits.

A spokesman for Kate and William said the royal family knew the details had been released, and that the information was in line with other visits to New Zealand.

The duke and duchess have planned the trip so that they are able to return to George every night, apart from on two evenings.

Their new Spanish Norland-trained nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo is also travelling with them to share childcare duties.

While the Queen was forced to leave her two young children – Charles and Anne – at home when she undertook a six-month Commonwealth tour in 1953, William has told friends that leaving George behind was ‘unthinkable’.

‘The only thing they are worried about is how he will cope with the long flight,’ a source said, before adding: ‘He is a really happy and chilled little boy but they have warned people he might be a little grumpy.’
