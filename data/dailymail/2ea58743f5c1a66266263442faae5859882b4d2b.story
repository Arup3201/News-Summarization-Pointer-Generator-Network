Dramatic footage has shown the moment that a fearless clerk grabbed a machete and chased a would-be robber from the store after the masked man shot at him.

Surveillance cameras inside the Stop & Shop Deli on Long Island, New York captured the tense interaction that unfolded within seconds on September 25.

The masked thief entered the deli at around 8pm, carrying a backpack and waving a semi-automatic .22-caliber pistol at the clerk while he demanded the worker fill his bag with cash.

Quick thinking: But rather than getting money, as the robber demanded, he grabbed a machete from beneath the counter and can be seen pulling the two-foot blade from the sheath

On the video, the 24-year-old clerk, who has not been named, seems to hesitate before moving slowly towards the cash register.

At one point he flinches - the only sign on film that the gun went off - and he quickly regains composure to reach beneath the counter - pulling a two-foot machete from its sheath.

He then lunges towards the stunned robber, waving the weapon in front of his face. The robber takes off and the clerk chases him across the parking lot.

The gun had gone off once but the bullet hit the wall behind the clerk, the New York Post reported.

Deli owner Elena Alvarado told NBC 4
that the store started keeping the machete behind the counter a month 
ago 'for protection' because her store has already been broken into a 
dozen times.

But she said she wished the clerk, who has worked there for four years, had not chased the robber.

'You can make money again, but not your life,' she said.

The suspect is as a young, 
black male with a thin build, about 5-foot-10, police said. He was wearing a gray 
mask, black top with white stripes on the sleeves, dark pants and 
black-and-white sneakers.

Suffolk County Crime Stoppers is offering
a reward of up to $5,000 for information that leads to an arrest and anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 
1-800-220-TIPS.

Police added that the August 2011 on the video is just a glitch and the incident indeed occurred last month.
