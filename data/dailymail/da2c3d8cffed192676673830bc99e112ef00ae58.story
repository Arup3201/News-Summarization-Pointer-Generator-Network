Polish authorities believe a body found floating in a canal is that of an Irish football fan after documents in his name were discovered on the corpse.

The 21-year-old James Nolan disappeared in the early hours of Sunday morning in the northern city of Bydgoszcz, sparking a huge search effort.

Police divers found a body early this morning and authorities are awaiting Mr Nolan's father to arrive later to formally identify it.

Prosecutor Wlodzimierz Marszalkowski says the soaked documents were Mr Nolan's insurance and credit card.

A spokesman for prosecutors, Jan 
Bednarek, said: 'There is a high probability that this is the body of 
the man we have been searching for'.

The body was found lying face down in fast-flowing water of the Bydgoszcz Canal and trapped by a weir that runs across it. The canal is an offshoot of the city's Brda River, and brings water for a small hydroelectric plant.

No signs of violence were apparent, deputy chief prosecutor Wlodzimierz Marszalkowski said. Robbery didn't appear to be the motive since 600 zlotys (£114) and a credit card were found on the corpse, he said.

An autopsy was planned for Thursday.

The clothing on the body matched a description given by friends of what Nolan was wearing when he went missing, officials said.

Before today, a time-stamped photo on a friend's phone was the last trace authorities had of Mr Nolan, who had travelled to Poland to support Ireland at Euro 2012.

The image shows Mr Nolan with his 
friends at 2am on Sunday, but everything after that is a mystery, one 
compounded by the blurry memory of friends who had been drinking. Now, 
an intense search is under way across the city and in its Brda River, 
involving more than 100 police officers.

Photos
of Mr Nolan have been plastered around the city and one police official
says the disappearance is highly unusual for a usually peaceful place.

'Nothing like this has ever happened (here) before,' Ms Chlebicz said yesterday, providing new details into the search.

Mr
Nolan's own phone has been out of service since around the time he was 
last photographed. After his friends had slept and woke up later on 
Sunday morning, they tried calling Mr Nolan in his hotel room and only 
then realised he had never returned.

They then went back to the riverside bars where they had been the night before to look for him, but about 15 hours passed before they reported him missing.

Police said they have no information pointing to foul play and that so far they are treating Mr Nolan as a missing person. Rescue divers were called in yesterday to begin a search of the Brda River, which runs through the historic city centre and is lined with bars and restaurants. The underwater search resumed this morning.

'Mr Nolan's friends are of course 
trying to help the police, but the problem is that it was a party night;
they don't remember exactly when it was that they last saw him. They 
are trying to remember, but it's not very easy and so their information 
is not very helpful so far,' Ms Chlebicz said.

Mr
Nolan, of Blessington, County Wicklow, had travelled to the tournament 
with friends in a rented camper van, but was also registered at a hotel 
on the city's outskirts. He was last seen visiting local bars after 
watching televised games in a fan zone on Saturday night.

Ms Chlebicz said she is sure the missing Irishman has not left Poland nor traveled far from Bydgoszcz, because he had left his passport at the hotel and only had about 300 zlotys (£57) on him. A credit card he was carrying has not been used since his disappearance.

'We are hoping for a happy end to this situation, but right now we really don't know what has happened,' she said.

In Ireland, Mr Nolan's parents were distraught with his father expecting a call from his son Sunday on Father's Day after speaking to him the previous day.

'If there's anything anybody can do, we'd really appreciate it,' Jimmy Nolan said during a TV interview with Irish state channel RTE.

Fighting back tears, the father said: 'I know he's probably OK, but I mean, if anybody anywhere knows anything, please just let us know. Text us or ring us, or ring the Irish police'.

He and his wife Essie appealed for Irish football fans who have remained in Poland after their team's exit from Euro 2012 to help search for their son.

A Twitter campaign aimed at finding Mr Nolan, who studies environment engineering at Tallaght Institute of Technology in Dublin, was launched in Ireland with the hashtags #FindJames and #JamesNolan.
