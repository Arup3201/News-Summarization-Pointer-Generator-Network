Sarah Murnaghan, the 10-year-old Pennsylvania girl who underwent a double lung transplant after her family petitioned to get her on the adult donor list, is recovering slowly and in 'a lot more pain.'

The youngster, from Newtown Square, Pa., is still heavily sedated and intubated after being awoken from her medically-induced coma, her family told reporters.

Sarah underwent surgery on June 12 and has been recovering ever since.

Progress: Two days earlier, Sarah was taken off of a heavy-duty breathing machine, and she is now back on a traditional ventilator

'Tougher 24 hours. We are weening (sic) sedation and some pain meds to make Sarah more awake in preparation for extubation, but she is in a lot more pain', her mother Janet Ruddock Murnaghan wrote in a Facebook post today.

'It's
a BIG thing for such a little girl, but we know she can do it! Praising
God for all the progress', NBCnews.com reported her mother saying.

After lung transplant surgery, most patients have their breathing tubes removed within 24 hours and out of intensive care within a week, but while some are released from hospital within weeks, others take months.

Family spokeswoman Tracy Simon said Sarah had been awake since last Friday and was able to answer yes or no questions by nodding.

According to Simon, Sarah's family are excited to see their daughter doing so well, but reports that Sarah is frustrated because the tube is keeping her form speaking.

Sarah suffers from cystic fibrosis, a disease which was killing her up until the transplant last week. Doctors had only given her a few weeks to live without new lungs. Since she was too young to be put on the adult donor list, she faced certain death since child donations are rare.

She is making rapid progress. Two days 
earlier she was taken off of a heavy-duty breathing machine and is now 
using a traditional ventilator.

Sarah's plight sparked a national 
debate over organ transplant policies, which until now barred children 
younger than 12 from the adult waiting list.

On June 12, Sarah's mother said that a set of lungs had become available for her daughter.

'God is great! He moved the mountain! 
Sarah got THE CALL,' a statement posted on her Facebook page read. 
'Please pray for Sarah's donor, her HERO, who has given her the 
gift of life.'

That afternoon, Sarah's mother spoke to a reporter from Fox 29
about her daughter's searching, describing the family as being nervous 
but  'excited' about the surgery because doctors had given her child 
about a week to live, and they were out of options.

'We're just so thankful for the donor,' Ruddock Murnaghan said, adding that while it is a great day for her, it is not lost on her that it is a tragic day for the donor's family, who had lost a loved one.

The Murnaghans scored a
major victory on June 6 when a judge ordered the Organ Procurement and 
Transplantation Network to add the 10-year-old to the list for adult 
lungs.

On surgery day, Mrs Murnaghan said
that had it not been for the judge's recent ruling, they would not have
gotten this set of lungs, which likely came from an adult or teenager.

'Sarah would've been number 400 or something on the list,' she said.

The Organ Procurement and 
Transplantation Network added the 10-year-old to the list on Wednesday night after 
U.S. District Judge Michael Baylson's original ruling on June 5th..

The
ruling applied only to Sarah, who has end-stage cystic fibrosis and has
been awaiting a transplant at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

An expert has questioned the decision on medical and ethical grounds.

Lung
transplants are the most difficult of organ transplants, and children 
fare worse than adults, which is one reason for the existing policy, 
said Dr. Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University Langone 
Medical Center.

Fears: Janet and Fran Murnaghan criticized the regulations that kept Sarah from getting an adult lung

He called it troubling, and perhaps precedent-setting, for a judge to overrule that medical judgment, and predicted a run to the courthouse by patients who don't like their place on the waiting list.

'I'm not sure I want judges or congressmen or bureaucrats trying to decide what to do with organs at the bedside,' Caplan said.

The Murnaghans said pediatric lungs are rarely donated, so they believe older children should have equal access to adult donations.

Nationwide, about 1,700 people are on 
the waiting list for a lung transplant, including 31 children under age 
11, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.

Holding on: Before the transplant last on June 12, doctors said Sarah had just a week left to live
