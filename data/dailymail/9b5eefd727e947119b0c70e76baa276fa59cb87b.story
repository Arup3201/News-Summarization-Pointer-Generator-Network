A British mother-of-two who is accused of murdering her husband in the Caribbean has to wear a bullet proof vest to court after being sent death threats.

Nicole Reyes has spent almost 18 months in the Dominican Republic jail dubbed 'the Devil's Hotel' after her husband Jorge Quintanilla, 38 died in a road crash on the holiday island.

The former Thomas Cook travel rep maintains her innocence, claiming her partner's death was a tragic accident.

Nicole, 38, is yet to face trial, but has attended court hearings in protective clothing and flanked by a half-a-dozen armed guards following threats.

Her mother Jeannette Clements, 62, said: 'They told us we were all dead, one person shouted "none of you will leave this island alive".

'She had six SWAT men around her and she had to wear a bulletproof vest.

'She always loved that country, now she says she hates it'

She added: 'She used to say "I'll never leave this country" but now she says she can't wait to get out of there.'

Nicole, who is originally from Cardiff, has been given grade A security status because of the risk of other prisoners hurting her.

Even some of Nicole's friends who have visited her in prison have been threatened.

Nicole, who moved to the Dominican Republic ten years ago, says she accidentally ran over Jorge while he drove next to her Toyota SUV on his motorbike.

She faces 30 years in jail if convicted of his murder but claims she will kill herself if she is found guilty.

She is suffering with kidney stones and infections in her throat, chest and ear as well as an ongoing problem of bacteria in her stomach.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is aware she is being held in detention pending trial but say they are unable to help.

A spokesman said: 'We cannot interfere in the judicial process of another country, and must respect their systems.'
