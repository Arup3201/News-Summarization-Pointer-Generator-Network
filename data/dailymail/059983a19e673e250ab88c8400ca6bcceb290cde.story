Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Wayne Rooney have starred in an advert as animated versions of themselves in an attempt to prove that football can save the planet!

'The Match' as it is known, has been created by Samsung, and it sees the superstar trio playing for a Galaxy 11 against a race of aliens called the 'Hurakan' who are all rather good at kicking a ball about.

Franz Beckenbauer also features as the manager who picks the team, which doesn't at all explain the inclusion of Victor Moses and Lee Chung-Yong, whilst Martin Tyler provides the commentary...
