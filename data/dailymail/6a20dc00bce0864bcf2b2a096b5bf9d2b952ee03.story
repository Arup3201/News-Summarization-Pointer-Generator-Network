Cellulite is the bane of so many women's lives. That orange-peel effect, those unsightly dimples and that bumpy blubber that blights the thighs of everyone from the super slim to the ultra curvy.

Even the most slender of celebrities have found it impossible to defeat the scourge of orange peel thighs - just ask Kim Kardashian and Sienna Miller, who have both admitted they have cellulite.

From detox diets to miracle cellulite melting knickers or caffeine-infused tights, there is no shortage of gimmicks out there to help banish the bumps.

The latest? A cream made from coffee beans that promises to banish cellulite by breaking down fat and draining away toxins.

While caffeine is better known for 
boosting flagging energy levels, a new beauty product maintains that it 
can help boost blood flow and banish cellulite.

The
Cinq Mondes Slimming Coffee Cream is infused with caffeine to help 
drain toxins that cause fatty tissue deposits as well as breaking down 
fat cells in the skin.

The fat burning action of the caffeine combined with the green coffee, grapefruit acids and kola nut claims to effectively fight cellulite.

Experts recommend that you slather on the £43 cream after exercise as this increases the blood flow making the cream more effective.

Nataliya Robinson, of Nataliya Robinson Skin Clinic, said: 'Yes, coffee can help to break down cellulite.

'Natural materials such as caffeine have firm scientific basis for use in cellulite treatments (topically only), as it can actually stimulate lipolytic activity (fat breakdown).

'Coffee contains xanthines (found in most human body tissues) which increases lipolytic activity.

'The key to using coffee products on cellulite areas is to use it during the time when you are not eating, such as early morning or hour before bedtime, when insulin levels are not active.

'When you consume coffee, this stimulates insulin production and shuts down fat utilisation and lipolytic activity.'
