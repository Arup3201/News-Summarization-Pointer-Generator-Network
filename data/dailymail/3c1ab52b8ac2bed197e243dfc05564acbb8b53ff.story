Painful: Glenda Roots was bitten on her arm by what is believed to be a false widow spider

The false widow spider is being blamed for the swollen bite and a hospital is now investigating.

David Roots, Glenda's husband, said she was treated at hospital but was now 'doing fine'.

She was given antibiotic pills, injected with antibiotics and given a sling for her arm, but the hospital couldn't be sure it was a false widow bite.

He said: 'It was serious. The blister that came up on her arm was unbelievable.'

He said the poison had also seeped through her body and inflamed another bite on her leg from a 'gnat'.

 Harding, 24, who is also from Tonbridge, also took to Twitter to share a
 picture of what she believes to be a false widow spider in her house.

She discovered a bright red bite just below her knee and now her landlord is investigating whether there could be a nest in the house.

Chloe said: 'I woke up Thursday morning with a bite on my leg which I assumed was a mosquito, but it was large, swollen and made my leg ache all day.

'I spotted a spider - quite unique - by my bed, but didn't think much of it. I went away for the weekend and when I came back on Sunday the same looking spider was now in the kitchen.

'I took a closer look and noticed the skull-like markings on its back and knew it was a false widow.

'I trapped it and left it and by the morning it was dead. Then last night I found a slightly larger false widow climb in my bedroom window.

'My landlord has said he will investigate to see if there is a nest and remove it.'

False widow spiders are distinctive for their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns

False widow spiders are distinctive for their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns.

Millions of false widows, Britain's most venomous spider, have been found across the UK and the population is believed to be growing.

The species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull. They have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size.

Also known as steatoda nobilis, the spider is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom.

The false widow was first spotted in the UK in Torquay, Devon, in 1879, and it is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from Madeira or the Canary Islands in a shipment of bananas.

The Natural History Museum says that warmer summers mean the spider is spreading northwards through the UK, having been found mainly in southern England.
