A woman is staging a grass roots protest after the council have ordered her to rip up the $10,000 synthetic lawn she planted on land that belongs to them.

Gold Coast City council reportedly claimed the fake grass 'could trap someone wearing stilettos'.

But Diane Padbury reckons the man-made lawn she installed at a nature strip 'looks great' and is actually helping the environment by saving water from being used.

Turf war: Diane Padbury is proud of the $10,000 synthetic grass that she planted but Gold Coast City Council have ordered her to rip it up

Ms Padbury, who lives in Sovereign Island, a very affluent community within the suburb of Paradise Point on the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia, has vowed to fight the council's decision to get rid of her quirky creation.

She believes homeowners should be given control over neighbouring nature strips and that the council could save water with synthetic grass.

'I never watered the previous grass so it was brown and ugly,' she told the Gold Coast Bulletin.

'Now the area looks great and it doesnâ€™t require me to spend any money on water. I was told the synthetic grass was dangerous and could trap someone wearing stilettos. The whole thing is just crazy.'

The enthused resident is engaged in a turf war with the council who say she has 'ripped up council land and started developing without any guidance'.

Compliance officers are due to assess the unusual dispute towards the end of the week.

A spokesman for the Gold Coast City Council said that it comes down to a matter of 'principle'.

'We cannot create a precedent which encourages people to develop council land without even asking,' he said.

Councils across Australia have invested in synthetic grass for sports centres and recreational grounds.

By 2020 many of the tennis courts on the Gold Coast will be made from the material.

Benefits of the fake lawns include no watering, no fertilising, no mowing and no dangerous pesticides and chemicals.
