A spelling error on football stadium soft drink cups will forever mark this weekend’s Notre Dame game as the day of the ‘Figthing Irish.’

The typo was found on the 50-ounce cups sold at concession stands throughout Notre Dame Stadium, which boasts room for over 80,000 thirsty fans.

The $8 cups quickly became fodder for jokes on social media and have just as quickly become a collector’s item.

'Figthing Irish'? Concession cups at Notre Dame football stadium were sold Saturday with the team's name spelled incorrectly

The Catholic University is known for its brawling leprechaun mascot more than for biblical fruits and the cups were, of course, supposed to read ‘Fighting Irish.’

Notre Dame refuses to say how many cups were shipped, but insists the error will be corrected by the next home game.

Luckily for them, the typo only appeared on the larger size cups and not the more popular 32-ounce cup.

A spokesman also declined to say how the error occurred or who’s to blame.

Not telling: Notre Dame officials declined to disclose how many cups were sold or shipped with the error

‘It's an institutional responsibility,’ Dennis Brown told ESPN.com Tuesday. ‘We're not going to be blaming individuals.’

The school has until September 21, the date of their next home game, to fix the problem.

How will they accomplish this?

‘The solution is to correct them, which we will do,’ a clearly unamused Brown told ESPN. ‘It was an unfortunate mistake.’

Reactions on Twitter were more colorful.

‘Anyone else notice on the $8 cup they spelled fighting Irish as figthing Irish,’ asked user ‏@McMahon_Jerry63.

‘Nice,’ tweeted @kordr. ‘Let's go Irihs!’
