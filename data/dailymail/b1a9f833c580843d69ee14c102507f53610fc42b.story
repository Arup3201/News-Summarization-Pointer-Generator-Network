Princess Anne has joined Canadians to remember their war dead, weeks after a crazed gunman shot and fatally injured a soldier standing guard outside Parliament. 

Anne is in Canada to represent the Queen at this year's commemorations, which will take place later today at the National Memorial in Ottawa.

The visit comes just weeks after the death of Corporal Nathan Cirillo, who was murdered by an Islamist fanatic as he stood guard outside the Canadian Parliament building.

Tragic: The visit from Princess Anne comes weeks after Corporal Nathan Cirillo was killed in a gun attack

The attack, which took place next to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier close to Parliament, ended with the death of the gunman, who was shot dead by the House of Commons sergeant-at-arms.

As a result, security at the event has been tightened and echoes that put in place around the Cenotaph in London on Sunday,  following revelations of a 'poppy plot' to murder the Queen.

Travelling with her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Lawrence, the royal spent yesterday meeting soldiers before travelling to the National Military Cemetery in the Canadian capital.

There, she honoured the men and women who laid down their lives in service of Canada, before laying a fir wreath at the Cross of Sacrifice which sits at the centre of the 160 acre site.

Officially known as the Beechwood Cemetery, it was established in 1873 and is the final resting place of more than 75,000 Canadians. 

Tribute: The Princess Royal will join the Governor General to pay tribute to Canada's war dead today

Honour: Yesterday saw the royal lay a wreath at the National Military Cemetery on behalf of the Royal Family

Loss: In total, 56,639 Canadian soldiers were killed in action during the First World War

Dignified: The Cemetery is the final resting place of 75,000 Canadians, including WW1 PM Sir Robert Borden

Among are Army veterans and war dead, as well as a series of Governors-General and Prime Ministers, including Sir Robert Borden who led the country during World War One in which 56,639 Canadian soldiers lost their lives.

Also buried in the cemetery are many of Canada's famous Mounties or Royal Canadian Mounted Police, some of whom joined the Princess Royal as she paid tribute to their predecessors.

Earlier, the royal had visited the Canadian Police College in Ottawa where she met serving Mounties as well as a black mare named Anne in her honour.

Not in the least put out, Princess Anne stopped to give the animal a friendly pat before moving on to do the same with the rest of the herd.

Later today, the royal will join dignitaries, politicians and Governor General David Johnston at the National Memorial in Ottawa, where she will lay a wreath on behalf of the Queen. 

Anne, who will be in Canada until Wednesday night, is scheduled to arrive back in the UK on Thursday morning ahead of a Riding for the Disabled event in Omskirk.
