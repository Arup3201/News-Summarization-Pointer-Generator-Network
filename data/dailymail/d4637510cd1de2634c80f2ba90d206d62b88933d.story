Reece James is the name on many Manchester United fans' lips after the young full back scored twice in Louis van Gaal's first game in charge of the club.

The 7-0 friendly win over LA Galaxy saw a new 3-4-3 formation work a treat, Ander Herrera put in a sparkling performance in midfield and Wayne Rooney return to goalscoring form, but James stole the show with two second half goals from left wing back.

So, with the 20-year-old having staked a claim for a regular spot under Van Gaal, Sportsmail tells you all you need to know about James and assesses his chances for the future...

How come I have never heard of Reece James before?

Thursday's win over LA Galaxy was the 20-year-old's first first-team outing of note, in either friendlies or competitive matches. He has represented the club's youth teams but has never played alongside so many of United's leading lights.

A player is not necessarily considered 'young' at 20 these days, why has it taken him so long to break through?

Firstly, the depth of United's reserve and youth set-ups must be noted. There are some very good footballers who struggle to get a game for their second string. Secondly, James only joined at Under 18 level - relatively late to sign for a professional academy.

Where was he before then?

James played at Blackburn and Preston's academies before moving to United. His older brother Matty, now at Leicester, was already at United's academy when Reece signed up.

What professional experience does James have?

Frankly, not much - especially given the fact James is 21 in November. A loan spell at Carlisle at the start of the last season was cut short by injury after just two appearances.

Enough of the background, what sort of a player is he?

James is an attacking left back, small in stature, but blessed with pace. He is comfortable receiving the ball in the final third, as he showed with two neat finishes in Pasadena on Thursday.

What made Van Gaal plump for him?

The Dutchman has stated his intent to play 3-4-3 with wing backs. Summer signing Luke Shaw will be the starting left wing back but with Patrice Evra and Alexander Buttner having recently left, and with Fabio departing in January, it's an area where the United boss has few options.

What are the chances of him staying in the first-team?

James knows he has very little chance of displacing Shaw in United's first-team - even though he is 20 months his senior - but if he keeps up the good work he could be a squad member as back-up to the £31.5million man. United have been linked with Wolfsburg's Ricardo Rodriguez but Van Gaal will be reluctant to over-spend on a bench-warmer and has declared his intention to promote youth.
