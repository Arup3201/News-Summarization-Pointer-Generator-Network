Chris Simcox, the co-founder of the border control militia Minuteman Civil Defense Corps, was arrested Wednesday on charges of child molestation

The co-founder of a border control militia and former kindergarten teacher was arrested Wednesday on charges of child molestation.

Chris Simcox, 52, who co-founded the Minutemen Civil Defense Corps in 2005, is accused of having sexual contact with three young girls under the age of 10.

Phoenix police booked him into Maricopa County Jail Wednesday morning on five charges including two counts of child molestation, two counts of sexual conduct with a minor and one count of attempted molestation of a child.

Detectives with the department's 
Family Investigations Bureau developed 'probable cause' that Simcox had 
sexual conduct with the girls during the past several months, said 
Sergeant Tommy Thompson, a Phoenix police spokesman.

Simcox has denied the allegations to police. It was not known if he had an attorney.

A
 former kindergarten teacher from California, Simcox co-founded the 
border watch group to highlight what he said was the government's 
failure to secure the porous southwest border with Mexico.

Its force of housewives, office workers 
and veterans sat in lawn chairs in southern Arizona, spotting suspected 
migrants whom they reported to the U.S. Border Patrol, until the group 
disbanded in 2010.

Shortly before it disbanded, Simcox resigned as Minuteman president and announced in April 2009 that he would challenge McCain in the GOP primary, but he dropped out of the race.

Simcox has had legal trouble in the past.

In 2010, his third ex-wife alleged that he tried to kill her on at least two occasions. A judge ordered a protection order against him and ordered him to surrender his firearms as a result of the accusations.

His first wife also accused him of trying to molest their teenage daughter, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights group that has warned about extremism in the Minuteman movement.

And his second wife filed an emergency 
motion to obtain full custody of their teenage son because it seemed 
Simcox was growing dangerous following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist 
attacks, the SPLC reported in 2005, based on an examination of court 
records in Los Angeles.

In April 2004, a federal judge sentenced Simcox to two years of probation for carrying a firearm on national forest property.

In that case, he was found guilty of knowingly entering Coronado National Memorial in January 2003 with a weapon and giving false information to a park ranger by denying that he was carrying a weapon.
