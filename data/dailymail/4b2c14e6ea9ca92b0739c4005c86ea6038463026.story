The mother of a four-year-old boy struck by a car on a family holiday said she was forced to sit in the middle of the road nursing her dead son while paramedics 'looked the other way'.

Thomas McLaughlin died after he was hit by a car  as it reversed out of a driveway at McMasters Beach on the NSW Central Coast on January 6.

At an inquest on Monday into Thomas' death, his mother Michelle, a registered nurse, said the day she lost her middle child was 'crystal clear', the Daily Telegraph reports.

Family: Thomas with his father David, mother Michelle and siblings Hugh and Sopie

'I sat in the middle of the road with a dead child (and they were) watching me,' she said. 

'Every time I looked up, they looked away. No one came over to me on the roadway.' 

Police say Thomas ran from behind a parked car and into the path of the four-wheel drive driven by a 64-year-old woman in front of his family's holiday rental property.

He was getting ready to go for a swim while on holidays with his family when the accident unfolded. 

The inquest heard the driver 'didn't have time to react' and his death appeared to be 'an extremely tragic accident'.

Thomas' parents, Michelle and David, have set up a road safety foundation in their son's name titled the Little Blue Dinosaur.

They are currently championing the review of road safety within holiday town where infrastructure doesn't cater for tourist spikes. 

The foundation also hopes to introduce safety improvements to holiday town roadways. 

The inquest into Thomas' death continues.
