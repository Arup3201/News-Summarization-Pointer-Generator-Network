Norman Headworth, 92, who died the day after falling down steps on a family day out after having to wait 90 minutes for an ambulance 

An elderly RAF veteran who suffered a serious head injury in a bad fall died after having to wait 90 minutes on a concrete step for an ambulance.

Norman Headworth, 92, died at Colchester General Hospital four days after he tumbled down steps while on a day out to the seaside with his family.

Mr Headworth, a former Wellington bomber air gunner from Long Melford near Sudbury in Suffolk, suffered a fractured wrist and a major bleed on the brain as a result of the fall.

He had enjoyed a cup of tea at a seafront pub in Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex, and fell as he walked a few yards to meet his daughter Moira Cruickshank, who was waiting for him in her car.

But then he had to wait for an hour-and-a-half before the emergency services arrived.   

Now his family say he 'deserved much better' - with his son-in-law, retired cardiologist John Cruickshank, saying he believed the ambulance took so long because of Mr Headworth's age. 

'Waiting for the ambulance seemed to go on forever,' Mr Cruickshank said as he recounted the incident, which happened in May.

'We made at least three calls and I had to answer the same questions every time. Norman had broken his wrist and banged his head - it was a severe injury.

'I am a medic but you don't have to be a doctor to know that the quicker you get to a head injury the better the chances of survival.

'Had the ambulance got there in the usual 20 minutes, the chances of his survival would have been better.'

An inquest into Mr Headworth's death was held in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk last month, but full details of the ambulance delay have only now emerged.

Mrs Cruickshank said she agreed with the hearing's accidental death verdict - but she stressed her father may have survived if he'd been treated as a priority case

'At 92 he had been through the last war,' she added. 'He lived with us in a self contained flat, was no burden on the state whatsoever and was in good health.

'It's so sad because he just missed out on all the D-Day 70th anniversary commemorations, which he was really looking forward to.

'He wanted to make 100 and probably would have done so. He deserved much better.'

East of England Ambulance Service (EEAST) carried out a full investigation into the incident.

Chief executive Anthony Marsh gave his 'sincere apologies' for the long wait in a personal letter to the Cruickshanks after the probe.

Mr Marsh told the couple: 'I am able to state that between the time of 14.49 and 15.44 hours, all other emergency ambulances were either not available to respond for various reasons, or assigned to other emergency incidents which were coded higher and immediately life threatening or out of service for a variety of reasons.'

He insisted that the patient's age does not affect the coding of a 999 call or level of response provided.

Mr Headworth died the day after the fall at Colchester General Hospital after suffering a broken wrist and a bleed on the brain 

Last night, Gary Baines, EEAST senior locality manager for north Essex, said: 'We have been in contact with Mr Headworth's family about what happened and the operational demand we faced on the day of his accident.

'We prioritise all 999 calls according to those patients in most serious need, but clearly want to reach and treat every patient as quickly as is possible.

'As we work hard to put more ambulances on the road with more new staff recruited in Essex, this will improve our response times.'

Mrs Cruickshank said that her father volunteered to join the RAF in November 1940 when he was just 18 - even though his worried mother wanted him to wait to be called up.

He was accepted for aircrew training and sent to Squire's Gate Blackpool, the leading training site in the UK for air gunners.

The 92-year-old volunteered to join the RAF in November 1940 and went on to fly in Wellington bombers, pictured, based in North Africa 

Mr Headworth went on to fly in Wellington bombers based in North Africa and took part in the campaign to capture Italy from the Germans in 1943 to 1944.

During his time in Africa, the veteran recalled being 'strafed' by German fighter planes, just making it to a slit trench in time, head first onto other occupants.

He also recalled flying into a hail of flak and tracer bullets in a famous raid on Benito Mussolini's Italian Navy over the Bay of Taranto.

He then went on to be stationed at RAF Knockholt in Kent which housed the Ivy Farm Communications Centre where German radio messages had been intercepted, transcribed and forwarded to Bletchley Park for decoding.

There he met his wife Beryl Weston, who he married on June 11, 1945, just 35 days after the German surrender, and went on to set up his own successful driving school in the late 1950s.
