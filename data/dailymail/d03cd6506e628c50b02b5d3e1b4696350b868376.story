Europe must take the axe to its bloated benefits bill, which now accounts for half of all welfare spending on the planet, George Osborne warned today.

The Chancellor delivered a blunt message to other EU leaders, telling them: ‘We can’t go on like this.’

Mr Osborne raised the prospect of Britain leaving the EU altogether if the 28-nation bloc fails to undertake fundamental reforms.

Warning: George Osborne said other EU countries must reform if they do not want Britain to leave

Mr Osborne use a speech at an Open Europe event to warn Brussels must improve competitiveness, create jobs and protect the rights of countries which are not in the single currency

He said Brussels must improve competitiveness, create jobs and protect the rights of countries which are not in the single currency.

The Tory leadership has been under growing pressure in recent months to make it clear they would be willing to campaign for a British exit from the EU if other countries refuse to hand back significant powers.

Last year, David Cameron promised that if he remains in Downing Street after the next election he will seek to renegotiate a looser, more trade-based relationship with the EU before holding an in/out referendum on membership by 2017.

Ministers believe that as burgeoning economic recovery puts Britain at the top of the EU’s growth league, its influence in demanding reforms is rising.

Mr Osborne issued a stark warning about the consequences of the EU failing to cut back on bloated welfare spending

Mr Osborne, speaking today at a conference on EU reform hosted by the Open Europe think-tank and the Fresh Start group of Tory MPs seeking a new relationship with a reformed EU, indicated he favours remaining in a reformed union.

But he issued a stark warning about the consequences of a failure of the EU to introduce more flexibility in the labour market and cut back on bloated welfare spending. 

Brussels must not put the UK in a position where it has to choose between joining the single currency to protect its interests or leaving the EU, Mr Osborne added.

The EU accounts for 7 per cent of the world's population, 25 per cent of its economy but 50 per cent of all welfare spending.

Mr Osborne said the European economy has 'stalled' with one in four young people out of work and the number of investions halving in a decade.

The Chancellor suggested the British people would turn their backs on the EU unless other countries agreed to reform.’

The biggest economic risk facing Europe comes from ‘a failure to reform and renegotiate’, he said.

‘It is the status quo which condemns 
the people of Europe to an ongoing economic crisis and continuing 
decline. And so there is a simple choice for Europe: reform or decline.’

Mr Osborne said it was 
already clear that Europe faced a ‘competitiveness problem’ before the 
financial crisis of 2008 and 2009.

‘But
 the crisis has dramatically accelerated the shifts in the tectonic 
economic plates that see power moving eastwards and southwards,’ he 
added.

Booming: India's economy is set to outstrip that of the UK before 2030 and overtake much of Europe

‘Over the last six years, the European economy has stalled. In the same period, the Indian economy has grown by a third, the Chinese economy by 50 per cent. Over the next 15 years Europe’s share of global output is forecast to halve. Make no mistake, our continent is falling behind.

‘Look at innovation, where Europe’s share of world patent applications nearly halved in the last decade. Look at unemployment, where a quarter of young people looking for work can’t find it. Look at welfare.

‘As Angela Merkel has pointed out, Europe accounts for just over seven per cent of the world’s population, 25 per cent of its economy, and 50 per cent of global social welfare spending. We can’t go on like this.’

Andrea Leadsom of the Fresh Start group said if Britain voted to leave the EU, negotiations would be ‘more fruitful’ than before the referendum.
