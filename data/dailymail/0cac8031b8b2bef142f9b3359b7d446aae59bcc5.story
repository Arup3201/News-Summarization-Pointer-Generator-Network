Almost 20,000 families may be hit with the financial burden of laying to rest their loved ones after people signed up to unprofitable funeral plans immediately after World War II.

Gavin Turner lost his mother Beryl Turner to Parkinson's disease two years ago and has been locked in a legal battle with a funeral company ever since after he was told he owed $7,195 despite Ms Turner setting up her own pre-paid plans in 1948 when she was just 16.

The court decision over who must pay the money will be handed down on Thursday which could have serious ramifications for about 19,500 other Queenslanders signed up to the same funeral plan.

Beryl Turner set up her own pre-paid funeral plans in 1948 when she was just 16

Gavin and his wife Fiona Turner approached Alex Gow Funerals with the certificate and were told Ms Turner's money had been placed in a Queensland Government trust,  and was now only worth $390

Alex Gow Funerals provided 1,000 of the plans including Ms Turner's while 18,500  are with Metropolitan Funerals.

Gavin said his mother would be 'mortified' by the situation after paying small contributions over 32 years for a funeral service so her family would not have to suffer the financial burden.

'It was after the war, they had seen a lot of people who did not have access to a proper send-off so I think they were very mindful that you should put things in place,' he told 7.30. 

Gavin and his wife Fiona Turner approached Alex Gow Funerals with the paid certificate his mother had received when she made her last payment in 1980 and were told her money had been put in a Queensland Government trust which was now only worth $390. 

Fiona Turner said the company told them would be discounted that amount but would be required to pay the rest.

'All of this happens at a time when you're at your most emotionally distraught, straight after you've lost someone,' she said.

More than $5 million worth of funeral plan payments are believed to be sitting in the Queensland Government trust, 7.30 reported. 

Gavin Turner said he hoped the court decision would go in their favour to provide closure on the distressing experience and set a precedent for other families in the same situation. 

'It's hard, in all honesty, to put mum to rest when you think this court case and all the legal comings and goings are still very much in play,' he told 7.30.

'If I can stop one or two more families in Queensland from having to deal with this, then I feel that us bringing it to light has been a very decent outcome.'

'It could mean the difference between whether they can lay their loved ones to rest with peace of mind or whether they are going to have to incur expenses they haven't planned for,' The Turner's lawyer, Robert Burns, said.
