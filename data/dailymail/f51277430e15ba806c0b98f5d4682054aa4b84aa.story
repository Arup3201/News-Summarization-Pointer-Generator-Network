Tesco has removed horror film 'The Hospital (2013)', pictured, from its shelves following complaints about its 'extreme violence and pornography'

Tesco has apologised for stocking a violent horror movie in some stores and has removed it from shelves amid claims it was unsuitable for a family supermarket.

The high-street favourite decided to pull ‘The Hospital (2013)’, which is rated 18 by the British Board of Film Classification.

Tesco was alerted after a customer bought the DVD and, after watching it, complained there was no warning on the cover alerting to its ‘extreme violence and pornography’.

The DVD’s cover describes the film as ‘creepy, violent, bloody and fun’ and it has been described as ‘the sickest film since Rosemary’s baby.’

However, Tesco reacted promptly to the complaint and immediately instructed for it be removed from all stores.

A
 Tesco spokesman said: ‘The Hospital is approved for general release and
 rated 18.

'However, on this occasion, we’ve made the judgement to remove
 it from sale.

‘We are always pleased to listen to feedback and remain focused on offering the most popular titles to our customers.’

The film tells the tale of haunted Old St Leopald’s Hospital where a serial rapist, murderer, and psychopath called Stanley is on the loose.

It centres around the killer and a young student, who is investigating ‘ghosts’ at the hospital for a school project but who quickly becomes Stanley’s ‘new pet’.

Customer Matt Holmes contacted the supermarket chain after purchasing the DVD for £8 in a store in Gloucester, Gloucestershire.

He
 said: ‘I love horror films and I am not easily shocked. But I wasn’t 
prepared for the graphic sexually violent scenes depicted in this film.

‘The quality of the film was terrible in my opinion so I’m not sure why Tesco would want to sell it anyway.

‘But it was the nature of graphic sexual violence which I found shocking.

‘I would have no problem with the film being sold online or available for rent but I didn’t expect to see it for sale in Tesco.

Customer Matt Holmes said he purchased the DVD for £8 in the Tesco store in Gloucester, Gloucestershire, but complained after watching it due to its 'graphic content'

‘I
 was also surprised having watched it that there was nothing on the 
cover warning of the extreme nature of the content as you normally see 
on films like this.’

The 
founder of Netmums, Britain’s biggest parenting website, also said the 
film wasn’t suitable for supermarket shelves and said it was disturbing 
that children could stumble across it while browsing the DVD section.

Siobhan
 Freegard said: ‘The place for this DVD is a specialist film store, not 
on the shelves of Britain’s biggest supermarket. Shoppers simply don’t 
pop into Tesco for extreme violence and pornography.  

‘Lots
 of parents let their children browse the DVD section to pick up the 
latest children’s films, so it’s disturbing this type of movie is on 
offer alongside normal titles.

‘Supermarkets
 pour millions of pounds a year into appearing family friendly, but they
 need to check what’s sitting on the shelves to make sure the stock 
matches the marketing message.’

After being informed the DVD was being pulled from shelves, Mr Holmes said the supermarket chain had ‘done the right thing by removing it from sale so quickly’.
