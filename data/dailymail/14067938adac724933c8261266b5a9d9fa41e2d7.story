Theme park fanatic Marcus Gaines has blown £33,000 on riding 1,099 rollercoasters. 

The television cameraman, 36, spent the cash on flights, hotels and entry to 251 parks on his 46 trips to 19 countries.

They include 456ft tall Kingda Ka, in New Jersey, U.S., and 8,133ft-long Steel Dragon 2000, in Nagashima, Japan.

The father-of-one, from Southampton, spends the equivalent of one month a year in a theme park.

He jets abroad for breaks several times a year with friends, family, or alone - simply to experience the thrill of a new ride.

The tracks of the rides alone covered would stretch 905 miles - the equivalent of the distance between London and Barcelona, in Spain.

Mr Gaines has rode Nemesis at Alton Towers, in Staffordshire, approximately 350 times.

Remarkably, he has never been sick on a ride.

Mr Gaines said: 'Nothing gives me as much of a thrill as a rollercoaster.'

He first rode a coaster aged five, during a family visit to Clarence Pier, in Southsea, Hampshire.

At the age of 25 his 'coaster count' stood at a modest 50.

But he joined the European Coaster Club that year and has since added an average of 100 coasters a year.

His most recent trip was to China, earlier this month, when he conquered 70 coasters in 26 parks over three weeks.

He has already booked a trip to Denmark in August, when he finally hopes to hit the mark.

World's tallest steel coaster - Kingda Ka, Six Flags Great Adventure, Jackson New Jersey, 456ft tall

World's longest steel coaster - Steel Dragon 2000, Nagashima Spa Land, Japan , 8,133ft long

World's tallest wooden coaster - Colossos, Heide Park, Saltau, Germany, 196ft tall

World's Longest Wooden Coaster - Beast, Kings Island, Ohio, USA, 7,359ft long

World's fastest wooden coaster - El Toro, Six Flags Great Adventure, Jackson, New Jersey, 70mph.

Other countries he has visited on his quest for excitement are Austria, Belgium, Canada, Cuba, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Luxemburg, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.

Mr Gaines said: 'I'm like a little child who still gets incredibly excited at the sight of a new rollercoaster.

'As soon as I see the track, I'm buzzing with excitement and desperate to get on board

'I used to get scared just looking at the height, twists, and turns of some rides - but none of them daunt me anymore.

'In fact, I'm more nervous about theme park ghost trains.

'I tend to ride each rollercoaster several times in a bid to find the best seat, because the experience varies massively depending on where you sit.

'You get a better view at the front, but you get more G-force at the back, meaning your arms are pinned down by your side and you can't move.

'I like to find a seat where you get lots of negative G - the feeling of weightlessness and your stomach turning.

'I'm not much of a screamer. Instead, I prefer to whoop and cheer as I whizz round, then applaud or punch the air with joy at the end.

'I get this incredible rush of adrenaline and a real buzz from the rides.

'It's a form of escapism, which allows me to forget the stresses of everyday life and lose myself in the moment.'

Mr Gaines said his partner Susie Clarke, 34, 'tolerates' his hobby and their son Thomas, two, has notched up a count of three coasters already.

Miss Clarke occasionally travels abroad with Marcus, when she allows him a few days to explore the theme parks before returning to a more traditional break.

He said: 'Since having Thomas, I'm looking at theme parks in a different way and making a note of those I wish to return to when he gets older.

'I'm not pushing my passion onto him but I do hope he will take an interest.

'He is already fascinated by our local theme park, where he knows how the safety bar works, and has walked straight off a ride and back to the queue.'

Mr Gaines added: 'From my travels, I've seen how different nationalities embrace rollercoasters in different ways.

'The Japanese and Chinese keep their heads down, terrified of what's to come - whereas the Germans go wild and shout and scream.

'In Spain, queue-jumping is rife, and I have found myself moving backwards as I wait to board a ride.'
