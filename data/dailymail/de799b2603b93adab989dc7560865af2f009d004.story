Rafael Nadal and Maria Sharapova have both crashed out of Wimbledon after the pair lost in front of a packed Centre Court today.

The men's world number one lost to Australian teenager Nick Kyrgios in four sets while the women's fifth seed was beaten by Angelique Kerber, just weeks after winning the French Open in Paris.

The 19-year-old Australian, who is ranked 144 in the world, condemned Nadal to  defeat, completing three miserable years at Wimbledon for the 14-time grand slam winner.

The Canberra native, who is playing in his first Wimbledon, got the better of the Spaniard to book a last-eight clash with Canada's Milos Raonic.

Sharapova, whose hopes of winning a second Wimbledon title in 10 years were ended by the loss,  put on a brave face and pointed out the match could have turned her way in the late stages.

She also argued it was much too soon to speak of a changing of the guard at the pinnacle of the women's game. 

'The grand slam champions so far this season are myself and Li Na, yet you see a younger generation that's driving through the grand slam stages, playing exceptionally against top players,' Sharapova said.  

Kyrgios, who was ranked world number 838 last year, admitted he gained motivation after hearing mother Norlaila give an interview back in Australia admitting Nadal was the pre-match favourite.

'I saw an interview with her saying he was too good, so that made me a bit angry and that helped!' he joked. I think I was in a bit of a zone out there, I didn't really notice the crowd that much.

'I played extraordinary tennis.I got that break in the fourth set, served really well throughout the match, and I'm really happy. It hasn't really sunk in yet.

'You've got to believe that you can win from the outset, and I always do that. He hit some unbelievable shots.'

Admitting he was at a loss how to celebrate, he said: 'I didn't know what to do: I've just turned to everyone that's supported me my whole life.I didn't really know what that dance was.'

There was also drama on Court One today as Serena Williams broke down on court and was forced to quit her doubles match with sister Venus after she was hit by a virus. 

The tearful 32-year-old held her head in her hands as she was examined by medical staff ahead of the match.

The second-round doubles match against Kristina Barrois and Stefanie Voegele was put off for over 10 minutes while she sat in her sideline chair and appeared to wipe her eyes as her blood pressure was checked. 

After the match, she admitted she was left 'heartbroken' to have to pull out of the tournament. 

She said: 'I really wanted to compete, but this bug just got the best of me.' 

Joy: The men's world number one lost to Australian teenager Nick Kyrgios (pictured) in four sets. The 19-year-old Australian sensation completed another miserable result for Nadal, who has reached the tournament's final five times

Emotional: The teenage sensation could not hide his utter disbelief at the end of the match after beating the five-time finalist

Congratulations: Before Kyrgios celebrated in front of the crowd, he shook hands with Nadal, who suffered an early exit from the competition for the third year 

Bowing out: The Spaniard waves to the Centre Court crowd. It is just weeks after he won the men's French Open title in Paris

Proud: Angelique Kerber smiles as she walks towards the net following her victory over women's fifth seed Maria Sharapova
