The sixth person arrested: Darren Curtis, 28, is the latest person arrested in connection with the September shooting at Chicago's Cornell Park

Mr Curtis was apprehended Friday at his South Side home, police said. He is expected to appear Sunday afternoon in Central Bond Court.

It is not exactly clear how Mr Curtis was involved in the attack, and officials are not commenting at this time.

The arrests come as the youngest 
victim- 3-year-old Deonta Howard- is said to be making a speedy recovery after he was shot in the cheek.

Police
 have identified two gunmen and three others who were accomplices, most of 
whom face attempted murder and aggravated battery charges.

Investigators believe Tabari Young, 22, 
was the principal gunman and he was charged Tuesday, McCarthy said. 
Bryon Champ, 21, who was charged a day earlier, was also a shooter, the 
police superintendent said.

A suspected lookout, Brad Jett, 22, and Kewane Gatewood, 20, have also been charged in connection to the shooting, which is Believed to be retaliation for a previous gang shooting weeks earlier, according to WLS.

Another suspect, David Logan, 22, has been charged with unlawful use of a weapon and obstructing justice, according to the Chicago Tribune.

Authorities describe Champ as a documented gang member and say he was convicted in July 2012 on charges of unlawful use of a weapon by a felon.

'He just keep saying, "Ma, they shot me, they shot me with a gun. You heard me, mama?" And I say, "Yeah, I heard you.' But I just say, 'You OK. You a big boy. You a soldier,"' the boy's mother Shamarah Leggett said.

Ms Leggett, 24, told the paper that her son's face and right eye are still swollen from the gunshot wound and he will need reconstructive plastic surgery.

The boy's spirits do not appear to have been beaten down, he was seen around his hospital room and refused to take off his new favorite Nike sneakers whenever he was put to bed.

Deonta's recovery is particularly remarkable given the fact that he was originally considered to be in critical condition initially after the shooting.

Julian Harris, 22, said the three-year-old victim was his nephew Deonta, who goes by the nickname 'Tay-man'.

'They hit the light pole next to me but I ducked down and ran into the house,' Harris said.

'They've been coming round here looking for people to shoot every night -- just gang-banging stuff. It's what they do.'

Corey Brooks, pastor of New Beginnings Church on the South Side, told the Sun-Times that the bullet passed through Deonta's face, but did not cause brain damage.

'The family's all here,' he said. 'They're pretty distraught.'

Twelve others - three women and nine men between the ages of 15 and 41 - were shot and emergency crews rushed them to hospitals. One of the victims was able to drive himself to hospital.
