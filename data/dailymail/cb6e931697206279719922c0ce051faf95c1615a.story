Owners of expensive homes could face a double death duty under plans proposed by Nick Clegg.

The Liberal Democrat leader wants to force families to pay a tax of one per cent a year on the value of homes over £2 million.

But pensioners who bought their home years ago for a much lower price and who cannot fork out the cash will be able to defer paying the ‘mansion tax’ until after their death.

Families could see their estates whittled down as they would pay potentially tens of thousands of pounds on top of inheritance tax at 40 per cent for amounts over £325,000.

Anyone with an expensive home who loses their job will also be able to defer paying the tax - but only for two years.

Mr Clegg unveiled the policy when speaking to a man with a costly home on the Deputy Prime Minister’s weekly phone-in radio show on London’s LBC 97.3.

The caller, who only gave his name as John, said he had bought a home in St Johns Wood, London, two decades ago.

The price had ‘skyrocketed’ and it was now worth an ‘obscene’ £5 million, he said but he could not afford the £30,000 a year ‘mansion tax’.

‘I work hard, I earn a reasonable salary. I do not earn as much as Mr Clegg but I’m happy with what I earn, but no way could I afford to buy a house now for anything like £5 million,’ he said.

A mansion tax would force him from his home as he could not afford the extra £30,000 a year tax.

‘This would take my total tax rate to 78 per cent. So my only option would be to sell the house that my family and I have lived in for 20 years and to withdraw my children from school.’ 

But Mr Clegg, who owns a home worth £1.5 million in Putney, south west London, revealed his plans for an inheritance tax blitz.

He suggested the caller sold his home or pay the tax on his death. ‘Of course you could make exceptions for those people who have lived in properties for a long period of time and have retired and obviously aren’t in a position to pay that kind of levy every year,’ he said.

‘You could pay it as part of your estate, for instance.’

But Chancellor George Osborne has ruled out adopting the Lib Dem policy of a mansion tax, warning it lead to intrusive revaluations of every home in the country, not just expensive ones

Mr Clegg has defended the policy, however, saying he did not want to ‘clobber’ people who were ‘asset rich but cash poor’, so they would allow them to defer the payment.

Mr Clegg also triggered fury when he suggested to the caller that he sells the home ‘because you would be millions of pounds better off because you’ve got a small mortgage from 20 years ago and that is in a sense, pure profit.’ 

Chancellor George Osborne has ruled out adopting the Lib Dem policy of a mansion tax, warning it lead to intrusive revaluations of every home in the country, not just expensive ones.

But the Tories have also been criticised for reneging on their pledge to increase the inheritance threshold to £1 million. This has now been frozen at £325,000 per person until 2019.

A source close to Mr Clegg said that he stood by his policy. ‘Nick leads by example, when he sold his Sheffield constituency home he gave the £30,000 profit back to the taxpayer.’ The source said the Conservatives were supportive of the policy.

However Labour has said it will introduce a mansion tax if it wins the next election, prompting Mr Clegg to accuse Labour leader Ed Miliband of ‘blatant plagiarism’.
