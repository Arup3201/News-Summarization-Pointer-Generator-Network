The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are livening up the idea of sedate royal tours, heading for an action-packed Down Under adventure which includes a jet boat ride, a chance to coach opposing rugby teams, a yacht race and a trip to bushfire ravaged regions.

The royal couple and Prince George will also experience the more traditional royal pit stops at military bases, civic receptions and encounters with Australian wildlife.

Despite the event-filled trip, the royal couple will not visit Melbourne, where officials are already complaining at being 'snubbed' by the Duke and Duchess.

Prince George's first official royal engagement will see him among children and mothers at New Zealand's Government house soon after their 18-day trip begins on April 7.

Action packed: Kate, Will and George's first Australian trip is an adventure-filled odyssey which turns royal tours on their head

Amazing ride: From the moment the pedal hits the floor, it will be a rip-roaring boat ride for the royal couple along New Zealand's Shotover River and deep into spectacular whitewater canyons

Poignant memories: Australia's largest rock, Uluru, the monolith in central Australia which is a significant Aboriginal landmark, is also the site where Prince William's parents, Princess Diana and Prince Charles visited (above) on their Australian tour 31 years ago

Grandma was here: Will and Kate's first stop in Sydney will be the iconic Sydney Opera House, opened by the prince grandmother, the Queen, in 1973

Prince William will also unveil a new portrait of his grandmother, the Queen, and visit the world famous Uluru monolith in Central Australia where his parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana, walked 31 years ago.

The Duke and Duchess are due to visit and meet locals in the city of Christchurch where 185 people died and New Zealanders are still rebuilding after catastrophic earthquakes three years ago.

The most fun filled day of the entire trip will be in New Zealand's South Island, when their royal highnesses will take the shotover jet boat ride, sample wine in the world famous Pinot Noir growing area of Otagao and, if they are keen, coach opposing teams in a local game of Rippa Rugby.

Rubbing noses: After a traditional Maori welcome, like the one Will received above on his tour of earthquake ravaged Christchurch three years ago, the royal couple will take baby George on his first official engagement to mingle with other young parents and children at New Zealand's Government House

George's pen: Prince George will also visit the enclosure at Taronga Zoo whihc houses the endangered marsupial, the Bilby (pictured) which was named after the newly-born last year

Hello world: Prince George will make his first official royal engagement at the age of eight-and-a-half months at New Zealand's Government House where Will and Kate and their hearty tot will mingle and swap stories, and when in Sydney they will stay at Admiralty House (above) where the the young family will have stunning views of Sydney Harbour from the Governor General's residence

After seven days in New Zealand, Will and Kate will begin the first leg of their Australian tour on April 16 at the Sydney Opera House, heading afterwards to Admiralty House, the Governor General's official residence on Sydney Harbour, where the couple will stay.

The next day they will drive to the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, to meet Australians who lost their homes in bushfires last October.

They will spend Good Friday, April 18, at the Royal Easter Show in Sydney, taking in the woodchopping competition, a flying pig show, baby animal displays and maybe catch a ride in sideshow alley.

The royals' Sydney stay will include a visit to Taronga Zoo, which has dedicated an enclosure for the endangered bilby to young Prince George. The family will view tree kangaroos, exotic animals like giraffes and orang-utans, and watch birds of prey display in an outdoor amphitheatre.

On April 22, they will arrive in Australia's red centre and take a walk around the giant rock known as Uluru with local indigenous guides.

Will and Kate will meet the Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, in the final days of their visit, and will spend Australia's most significant annual day of remembrance, Anzac Day, at the Australian War Memorial, to mark the looming centenary of the outbreak of World War I.

The royal couple will take part in the planting of a commemorative lone pine tree before leaving on a Royal Australian Air Force flight for London.
