A Californian mall descended into panic after a 'nasty and very dangerous' crocodile broke free from its cage and roamed among shoppers.

The four-foot reptile had apparently been abandoned in the parking lot of the TJ Maxx Plaza, outside a reptile centre, in Roseville before it made a bid for freedom and slithered inside.

Wildlife officials rushed to the scene to snare the animal after terrified shoppers called for help.

'Nasty': The four-foot reptile was described by officials as 'very dangerous' and 'nasty'

Snared: Wildlife officials rushed to the scene to snare the animal after terrified shoppers called for help

'This one is a really nasty crocodile,' said Patrick Foy, a game warden. 'It's got a really bad attitude. This animal genuinely is a very dangerous animal. Leaving it in a parking lot absolutely (puts) the public at risk, especially kids who might think that they can go and touch (it) - people who just don’t know how dangerous these crocodiles really are.'

Police are now hunting the person who dumped the Nile crocodile in its container with a note that simply read: 'Call rescue.'

Hungry croc: Wildlife officers lassoed the Nile crocodile and took it away for a meal of rainbow trout

'It was most likely a crocodile that was illegally brought into the country or illegally captured elsewhere in the county,' said Sgt. Jason Bosworth, with the Roseville Police Department.

It is thought the owner left it outside a reptile store in the complex, a known refuge for abandoned pets.

'But we normally get more common animals, like bearded dragons, iguanas, and pythons,' said Abigail Kessler, a store employee. 'A croc is unusual.'

'It's got a really bad attitude. This animal genuinely is a very 
dangerous animal. Leaving it in a parking lot absolutely (puts) the 
public at risk, especially kids who might think that they can go and

The crocodile is now being cared for by the California Fish and Wildlife Department, where officials are feeding it rainbow trout before donating it to a zoo.

Foy said the department believes the animal is indeed a rare Nile crocodile.

'It can grow to 15-, 16-, 20-foot type range,' Foy said. 'They can be enormous.'
