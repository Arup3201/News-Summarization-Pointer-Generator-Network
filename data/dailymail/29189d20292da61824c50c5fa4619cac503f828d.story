FOR parents, taking their children on holiday during term time means sanctions, fines and the threat of legal action.

But for the headmaster of Little Hill primary school wanting a vacation, it appears no such rules apply.

From the day her pupils return to school after Easter, Vina Pankhania will enjoy nearly a month off to get married – and come back just before school breaks up again for summer half-term.

Big day: The head of a Leicestershire school has asked for unpaid leave to marry partner Amit

Following a clampdown at the school, parents have regularly been warned their children are not allowed time off during term time except under ‘exceptional circumstances’.

Yet Miss Pankhania was given permission to take a month off by governors ‘because she has worked extremely hard’.

The 30-year-old, who writes of the ‘importance of respect, good manners’ and ‘high standards’ on the school’s website, will be on leave from April 28 – the first day back at school after Easter.

Getting married: Headteacher Vina Pankhania has been given a month off during term time

She is returning to work on May 23, 
three days before the summer half-term holiday starts. Parents reacted 
with fury when they received a letter from governors last week telling 
them about her plans.

One, 
Sonya Gilmour, said: ‘As a parent of two boys at Little Hill, I find 
this disgusting. How can governors approve leave just after Easter when 
parents themselves can be fined for similar actions? Surely the summer 
time off she has is big enough to accommodate a wedding.’

Miss Pankhania, 30, has been acting head teacher at the school in Wigston, Leicestershire, for just over two years.

Each year she is entitled to 13 weeks’
 holiday. Governors have allowed her to take her extra term time holiday
 as ‘unpaid leave’ so she can marry fiancé Amit Jain in India in May. 
While she is away the acting deputy head Helen Cartledge-Splitt will be 
in charge of the school, which has about 360 boys and girls, aged four 
to ten.

Another parent, who 
asked not to be named, said Miss Pank-hania was either ‘incredibly  
arrogant or naïve’ for talking almost half a term off.

‘Anyone
 employed in education gets ample holiday time to arrange weddings and 
holidays without needing time off during the term,’ he said.

‘The school refuses to authorise any pupils’ holidays during term and issues letters stating this at regular intervals.

One parent said Miss Pankhania was either 'incredibly arrogant or naive' for choosing to take time off during term when the school would not let pupils do the same.

Message: Miss Pankhania's school has said it granted the time off because she had 'worked hard' 

‘I
 feel the school has set a precedent and will be unable to enforce the 
policy applying to pupils or, indeed, any of the staff.’

Miss Pankhania refused to comment.

In
 a statement, the governors said: ‘Staff are usually required to take 
leave during school holidays. However, we have approved the acting head 
teacher’s request for unpaid leave to get married because she has worked
 extremely hard over the past two years, including during school 
holidays, to bring stability to our school.

Anger: Parents with children at Little Hill Primary in Wigston say the decision is 'disgusting' and 'arrogant'

‘Her deputies will cover her duties and this will not disrupt teaching. The majority of parents have wished her well.’

Children at the school used to be allowed up to ten days off during term time a year if there were ‘special circumstances’.

Now they are only allowed time off during term time under ‘exceptional circumstances’.

Parents
 who take their child out of school in term can be fined £60, which 
increases to £120 if it is not paid within 28 days. Failure to pay can 
result in court action.

The 
National Association of Head Teachers said: ‘It is inappropriate for us 
to comment on individual cases but the governing body of any school 
would carefully consider the facts before granting leave during term 
time.’

Last week a Lancashire school threatened a mother with
 court after her daughters missed class to spend time with their terminally 
ill father.

Teenagers
 Lydia and Leah Vaughan were last week at the bedside of their dying 
father, Martin, 40, after he was rushed to hospital after his cancer 
spread.

But their mother Nicolette was then sent a letter by their school threatening legal action for unauthorised absences.

She
 had kept Bispham High School in Blackpool, Lancashire, informed of her 
husband's illness since his first diagnosis in 2010 and had told them it
 had spread to his liver and was terminal.

But the school still sent out the threatening letter and have since apologised for their heavy-handed approach.

Last month it emerged a couple had been fined a total of almost £1,000 by magistrates after taking their three children away.

Stewart and Natasha 
Sutherland from Telford, Shropshire, remained defiant afterwards, saying the penalty, on top of 
the cost of the holiday, was still cheaper than going away during the 
school break.

They returned home from the week-long break to Rhodes – their first family holiday in five years – to find they had been fined £360. This was soon doubled to £720 because they did not pay up quickly enough.

The case went to a magistrates court where the Sutherlands were forced to enter a guilty plea. Their fine was amended to £630 with £300 costs and a £63 victim surcharge.

Speaking after the case, Mr Sutherland, said: ‘We had no choice but to plead guilty otherwise me and my wife could have been behind bars'.

Last summer it emerged a mother was fined £400 because 
her son missed a day of school nearly nine years ago because he had 
severe headaches as a result of an undiagnosed brain tumour.

Darilyn
 Rothwell, 51, from Radcliffe, Manchester, was given just seven days to 
pay the fine which was issued because her 24-year-old son Chris Barlow 
was off sick when he was a teenager in November 2004.

She
 claims she had informed the school that her son, who had to take 
several sick days in the months before his diagnosis, was ill but she 
was fined for his 'truancy' anyway.

Upset: The fine has been upsetting for Mrs Rothwell as it has also brought back bad memories of her son's battle with cancer

Mr Barlow, who now has three children
 of his own, collapsed with seizures in January 2005 and was on a life 
support machine for three days at Royal Bolton Hospital.

He was diagnosed with a brain tumour and underwent numerous operations. 

Mrs
 Rothwell was taken to court by Bolton Council later that year after 
education bosses claimed she was not doing enough to get her son back to
 lessons at Harper Green School in Farnworth after his treatment.
