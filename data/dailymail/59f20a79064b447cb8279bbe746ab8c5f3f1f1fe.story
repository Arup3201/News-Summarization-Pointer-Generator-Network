It may look like an unassuming van, but open the doors of this Mercedes people carrier and you’ll find a luxurious leather interior, similar to that of a private jet.

‘Flying three feet from the ground’ the Senzati Jet Sprinter Mercedes vehicle claims to be Britain's first incredibly luxurious people carrier.

The layout of its seats and colour of the interior can be customised to suit a VIP’s taste, including a desk, fridge for champagne and even a private bathroom for long journeys.

The vehicle is built by Senzati and is based on Mercedes’ Sprinter van, sometimes used by tradesmen.

The Coventry-based firm set out to design a vehicle to provide passengers with ‘the space uniquely found in a decent sized private jet’ that is able to be manoeuvred in cities and be discrete from the exterior.

‘The Senzati Jet Sprinter is unique; from the exclusive mid-ships cabin door and two metre glass roof to the sumptuous custom built seats and furniture,’ the firm’s website says.

The people carrier, which come in four models, has room for up to eight passengers and 12 suitcases, 6 ft four inches (almost two metres) of headroom, space for a private bathroom, entertainment system and home office, depending on which floorplan is chosen.

The seats themselves are made from quilted leather with electric headrests, a massaging system and climate control.

They can be configured in a range of positions by making the side door open backwards, giving passengers facing the rear privacy.

The position of the windows is changed at the point of manufacturing depending on the location of seats, so passengers can easily see outside.

A seven feet-long (two metre) sunroof provides extra light.

People customising their vehicle can even choose a hostess service to look after them on long jouneys.

The vehicles cost from £209,000 and can even be armoured for an extra cost.
