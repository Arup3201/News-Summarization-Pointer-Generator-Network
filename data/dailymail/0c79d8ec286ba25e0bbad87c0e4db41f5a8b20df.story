There will be no new Charlie Hebdo published this week, as surviving staff rest after burying colleagues that were killed in the Islamist terror attack on their office.

Bosses have vowed the satirical magazine will be published in the near future, but said that  staff are emotionally exhausted and still recovering after the massacre that killed their friends.

Michel Salion, speaking for the paper, said that a publication date had yet to be set - but confirmed that 'there will be a future' for Charlie Hebdo. 

The website of the paper promised the next 'rendezvous' will be in the coming weeks.

Je Suis Charlie: The first edition of the satirical paper that was published after the massacre sold more than seven million copies around the world. Michel Salion, speaking for the paper, said that a publication date for the next issue had yet to be set - but confirmed that 'there will be a future' for Charlie Hebdo

Tribute: Millions marched through Paris in the days that followed the attack as they showed their support for freedom of speech and the Charlie Hebdo staff

The paper printed approximately seven million copies of its first post-attack issue, that controversially featured an image of the Prophet Mohammed on the cover. 

The massacre, the first of three attacks in France that killed a total of 17 innocent people, began on the morning of January 7 when militants burst into Charlie Hebdo's office during a regular editorial meeting and shot dead five of its leading cartoonists.

Brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi chose the publication as the target of their attack after it repeatedly published cartoons of Mohammed, which some Muslims find deeply offensive.

The magazine once renamed itself 'Sharia Hebdo', claimed to be guest edited by the Prophet and carried the cover slogan '100 lashes if you don't die laughing'.

Their offices were burned down after a petrol bomb attack in 2010, believed to be connected to the images, though on that occasion nobody was hurt.

The paper continues to cause controversy around the world, and 
violence broke out at an anti-Charlie Hebdo protest in the
Afghan capital of Kabul on Saturday.

Around 500 protesters streamed into an eastern part of the
city, chanting 'Death to France' and 'Death to Infidels',
putting residents of nearby international compounds on a state
of alert.

Police sources said the protest turned violent when
protesters attacked policemen with burning tyres, stones and
then gunfire.
