The beauty of the world's most famous skylines simply cannot be denied.

From Toronto's skyscraping CN Tower, which reaches an impressive 1,814 ft (553 metres), to Dubai's Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world at 2,722ft (829.8 metres), these cosmopolitan cityscapes are as imposing as they are impressive.

While architectural preferences are subjective, of course, building data and project management website, Emporis, has a definitive ranking of the visual impact offered by skylines in major cities worldwide.

Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is home to the stunning Petronas Towers, though the city's 608 buildings tally just 8,077 floors altogether

Shanghai's futuristic skyline is not to be missed, especially the Oriental Pearl Radio & TV Tower, which is dotted with LED lights

Sao Paulo, Brazil, with a population of over 11 million, has 5,734 buildings considered by Emporis, with 17,859 floors in total

Toronto's skyline is most recognised for the CN Tower, which stands 1,814ft (553 metres) tall and overlooks Lake Ontario

However, their analysis only reflects completed high-rise buildings and does not include bridges, masts or other aesthetically-pleasing structures, like Sydney's Opera House, for example.

Emporis assigns each building points based on its floor count and the point total for each city is calculated. 

Currently in top spot? Hong Kong, which boasts 7,794 skyscrapers with a combined floor count of 133,531. 

Hong Kong's closest competitor is New York City, which is home to 6,090 buildings and a score of 43,101.

The central business district in Sydney looks gorgeous when viewed from offshore, in particular the iconic Opera House building

The Seattle skyline - photographed from Kerry Park at night - illuminates the majestic Mount Rainier in the background

The Chongqing municipality in China boasts a rapidly rising skyline and has 12 buildings with heights of more than 650ft (200 metres)

Rio de Janeiro overlooks the Guanabara Bay and is most recognisable due to the iconic Christ the Redeemer sitting high atop the city

The tiny island of Macau is home to the 47-storey Grand Lisboa hotel which looks like a giant fan reflected over the Pearl River

The Chicago skyline, as viewed from the Sears Tower, is a great Midwestern alternative to the oft-photographed New York City skyline

The downtown Seoul skyline comes in fourth place in the Emporis rankings with 3,023 buildings totalling 21,098 floors

Singapore's skyline has the unique feature of being home to the world's most expensive building: the multi-billion dollar Marina Bay Sands

The Manhattan skyline is one of the most photographed in the world, with the Empire State Building at its centre

Las Vegas is known for its glittering Strip, which includes a mini Statue of Liberty and Eiffel Tower, among other replica landmarks

Dubai's skyline is home to the world's highest building, the Burj Khalifa, which towers more than 2,722ft (829.8 metres)

Rio's iconic Christ the Redeemer statue, though not considered in the Emporis rankings, gives the South American city a boost in our own MailOnline Travel rankings, especially when photographed overlooking the stunning Guanabara Bay.

Similarly, Chicago's impressive skyline, set along the shores of Lake Michigan, offers a great alternative to the excessively photographed New York City landscape.

Singapore's glittering ferris wheel and the world's most expensive building - the Marina Bay Sands - help this city skyrocket to the top of the list. 

Meanwhile, Shanghai's light-studded Oriental Pearl Radio & TV Tower  helps to complete the futuristic aesthetic of China's third most-populous city.
