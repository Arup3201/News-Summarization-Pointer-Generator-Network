A man has died in an axe and knife attack outside a village pub barely an hour after he saw in the new year.

Police said 'major disorder' erupted around the Kings Arms in Tamerton Foliot on the outskirts of Plymouth, Devon, at around 1.30am today.

A group clashed on the tiny village green leaving a 27-year-old man dead, and two more people in hospital with knife wounds. He has been named locally as Tanis Bhandari, a builder. 

Probe: A murder investigation is under way after an axe and knife attack outside the Kings Arms pub in Tamerton Foliot near Plymouth, Devon, killed a 27-year-old man at around 1.30am today

Peaceful: Councillor Jonny Morris said the pub was a 'nice' place where trouble among punters was rare

Two further men from Plymouth - aged 20 and 21 - were arrested on suspicion of murder and are in police custody awaiting questioning. 

Officers, who have launched a murder investigation, recovered an axe from the scene and are asking residents to check their gardens for any discarded weapons.

Police said worried revellers called them to the pub after a man was seen carrying an axe and a knife.

Further calls were then made reporting 'disorder', and when officers arrived they discovered the 27 year-old with fatal injuries.

He was taken to nearby Derriford Hospital by ambulance but pronounced dead on arrival.

Much of the village was cordoned off for several hours following the violence.

Inquiry: Police said they found an axe at the scene but are still looking for possible further weapons

One neighbour of the pub said: 'The place was swarming with officers who appeared to be searching in a line'

Residents returning to their homes from New Year's Eve celebrations elsewhere found themselves escorted to their front doors by police.

One said: 'The police stopped us at each point on the way back into the village. By the time we had come back the incident was over.

'I was quite glad we weren't out in the village. It's a very close community and everyone says hello to each other and stops to chat. It's a big shock.'

Another said: 'The place was swarming with officers who appeared to be searching in a line.'

Another added: 'The road was all blocked. We had to walk part of the way home.' 

Councillor Jonny Morris said the pub was a 'nice' place where trouble was very rare.

He said: 'It it not the sort of thing that happens in Tamerton Foliot - it is a very nice sort of area.

'The Kings Arms is a nice pub I often have a lunch in. It is not the sort of place you would think this would happen. It is very sad.' 

Detective Superintendent Jim Colwell said: 'We are appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident or who was in the Tamerton Foilot area between 1am and 2am this morning to contact the police.

'We have established a cordon at Station Road to assist with scene investigation and our officers will be active in the area throughout the day conducting enquiries.'

Quiet: The village of Tamerton Foliot where the attack happened is on the outskirts of Plymouth in Devon

A cordon remained around large parts of the village today while police investigated the incident

A police spokesman added: 'An axe has been found but the knife has yet to be located.

'We are asking local residents to keep an eye out for anything discarded in their bins or gardens that seems suspicious and to call police if anything is found, without touching it.' 

Two men with knife injuries are still being treated in Derriford Hospital.

The two arrested men are being held at the city's Charles Cross police station.

A cordon remains in place at the scene.
