Action: Douglas Carswell saw the man running with items of shopping and chased after before pinning him down

A Tory backbencher has chased down and detained an alleged shoplifter in his constituency.

Douglas Carswell said he saw the man running in Clacton, Essex, with items falling out of his pockets, and store detectives in pursuit.

After catching the suspect and pinning him against a wall yesterday, he told him: ‘You probably don’t want to hear this, but I’m your local MP.’

Mr Carswell, who runs daily to keep fit, said: ‘There was a rather loud shout and someone sprinting as fast as they could down Pier Avenue,’ he said.

‘He looked like a ne’er-do-well.

‘I thought, “I can outpace him”.’

Mr Carswell, 42, added: ‘I chased him down an avenue and put him against a wall.

'As I was chasing him, various items of shopping were falling out of his pockets and trousers.

‘The thing I was really thinking about was, I hope my iPad, which was tucked under my arm, was safe.’

He said police thanked him for his efforts, and took the suspect away.

Mr Carswell later wrote on Twitter: 'Just chased and caught a shop lifter in Clacton …., waiting for police.'

Seven minutes later, he tweeted again: 'Police response time pretty effective. Arrested. Now off to my advice surgery.'

Essex police said that they had arrested a 29-year-old man of no fixed address after he was detained by store security and a member of public following the theft of aftershave from Boots.

The man was still in custody.
