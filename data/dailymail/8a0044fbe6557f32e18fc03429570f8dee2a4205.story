A couple is in jail after allegedly giving their toddler a mixed drink and giving the boy alcohol poisoning.

Cobb County, Georgia, authorities say the boy's blood alcohol level was 0.29 when he was taken to the hospital, more than three times the legal limit for drivers in that state.

The unidentified boy's mother, Jasmin Briana Moore, of Mableton, and William Chester Hickson, of Atlanta, were arrested and each charged with cruelty to children in the first degree.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that the boy was unresponsive when authorities found him, and had stopped breathing before he was taken to Children Healthcare of Atlanta. 

According to the arrest warrant, the couple had given him a mixed drink Saturday night.

'Said accused did give the victim, a 2-year-old male child, a mixed alcoholic beverage which consisted of Coca-Cola and 40 proof Paul Masson Brandy, or said accused had knowledge that said child was drinking said alcoholic beverage and allowed the child to continue drinking in the presence of said accused,' read each warrant.

Moore and Hickson are being held on $75,000 bond each.
