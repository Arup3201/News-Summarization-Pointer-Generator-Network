A Ryanair steward allegedly launched an obscene tirade at a passenger who turned down some food during a flight because it was so expensive.

Nadir Morris, 45, politely returned the snack, made up of two crackers and a piece of cheese, when the flight attendant told him it would cost £4.20.

In response, the steward allegedly told him: ‘**** you’, adding:  ‘This money helps pay for your cheap flights.’

Once the flight, from Stansted to 
Pisa, had touched down in Italy, Mr Morris demanded to know the 
steward’s name so he could make a complaint.

The steward refused and tried to push him off the plane, Mr Morris claimed.

Mr
 Morris, a father of two from Rome, told the attendant he was recording 
the encounter on his mobile phone – allegedly prompting another 
expletive-filled rant.

According
 to Mr Morris, he said: ‘**** you, **** you, **** you.  You happy now? 
Record again, **** you.’ Mr Morris said: ‘I couldn’t believe it. His 
reaction was totally unacceptable.’

 The steward is understood to have quit his job.

It is by no means the first time Ryanair has been accused of treating customers badly.

A
 recent Which? survey found that the airline was distinguished by its 
‘rude and unpleasant’ staff and an ‘aggressive and hostile’ attitude 
towards customers, who ranked it at the bottom of 100 brands in terms of
 customer service. Ryanair scored poorly for baggage allowance, boarding
 process, leg room – plus the quality as well as the price of its food.

At
 the firm’s annual meeting in September, shareholders were told the firm
 should try to ‘eliminate things that unnecessarily p*** people off.’

A spokesman for Ryanair said the reports of the incident were 'disturbing', adding that the airline 'unreservedly' apologise to Mr Morris

Mr Morris was shocked when the air steward asked for £4.20 in payment 
for a packet of two crackers and a piece of cheese on board the flight 
from London Stansted to Pisa in Italy

According
 to notoriously outspoken chief executive Michael O’Leary, that includes
 him. Last month he announced he was trying to stay out of the public 
eye, again to ‘stop unnecessarily p****** people off’, adding: ‘I’m 
getting in the way.’

He has 
previously caused controversy by referring to a passenger who complained
 about being charged to print out a new boarding pass as ‘stupid’, and 
calling overweight passengers ‘fat bastards on board’. In October he 
agreed to host a question-and-answer session with customers on Twitter –
 and found himself bombarded by critical comments.

Many
 customers told Mr O’Leary what an ‘a***hole’ they thought he was – and 
he agreed, admitting: ‘I’m an a***hole. But they still love me.’

'I'm getting in the way': Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has decided to remove himself from the public eye

The 
firm has recently launched a charm offensive in an attempt to win over 
its unhappy customers.

It announced plans to improve its website, 
revamp its customer service and introduce ‘quiet flights’, which have 
minimal public announcements and dimmed lights so  passengers can sleep,
 between 9pm and 8am.

Speaking
 about the latest incident with the steward, Ryanair spokesman Robin 
Kiely told The Sun: ‘We were disturbed by this report of such totally 
unacceptable behaviour.

While we are investigating this incident, the 
individual in question has resigned from Ryanair.

‘We sincerely and unreservedly apologise to the passenger in question.
