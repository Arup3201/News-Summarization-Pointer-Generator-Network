Accused: Robin O'Neill, 62, is charged with two counts of second-degree murder and is being held without bail in the deaths of 60-year-old Steve Lott and 28-year-old Jamis Lott

A woman accused of fatally shooting her fiance and his son on the day he ended their engagement pleaded not guilty Thursday to murder.

Robin O'Neill, 62, is charged with two counts of second-degree murder and is being held without bail in the deaths of 60-year-old Steve Lott and 28-year-old Jamis Lott.

O'Neill called a co-worker and said she had shot Lott and his son, according to a police affidavit. The co-worker called police.

Police said O'Neill appeared to be drunk when they arrived at the Townshend residence.

And as she was being driven away by police, she recited prayers, requested red wine and cigarettes, and told herself, 'you can go to prison for the rest of your life, 'cause you killed the (expletive).' 

In an interview, O'Neill said she and Lott had been engaged since July, but the relationship started getting 'weird' in September, with Lott spending time with a female friend, the affidavit said.

O'Neill told police she and Lott had gotten into several arguments in recent weeks in which he had become physical with her. 

'O'Neill told us she had multiple bruises on her body from Lott,' Detective Scott Dunlap wrote. 'During her interview, I observed bruising on both of O'Neill's arms.'

She told another officer that Lott had been 'beating the holy c**p out of me,' police said.

On Tuesday, as they were riding to work together, he told her the engagement was off, the affidavit said.

That night, she told police she drank a lot of wine, and Lott's son showed up to do laundry, the affidavit said. 

The two men talked in the kitchen, and Lott said she doesn't remember what happened next. 

She said she either picked up a gun or had the gun in her hand and saw the two men on the floor in a pool of blood, the affidavit said.

According to the Brattleboro Reformer, an acquaintance told police Lott had mentioned an argument he had with O'Neill as they lay in bed Nov. 15.

'O'Neill told Lott, 'I'll fix you,'' court papers say, recounting the alleged incident. 'O'Neill then leaned over to her bedside stand, and Lott reached across and slapped the drawer out of her hands. Lott knew O'Neill had a gun, and he thought she was getting her gun. Lott got up quickly, got dressed and got out of there.'
