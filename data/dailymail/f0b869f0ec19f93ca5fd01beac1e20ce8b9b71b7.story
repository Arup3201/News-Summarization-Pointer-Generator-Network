A balaclava-style mask is the latest trend in China to stop the sun's harmful rays.

Coming in a range of colours, the 'Face-Kini', which comes complete with a body suit, covers a swimmer's entire head and neck - down to the collar bone.

Holes are cut for eyes, nostrils and mouth, and stops the wearer's face from getting burned - and prevents them getting stung by jellyfish.
