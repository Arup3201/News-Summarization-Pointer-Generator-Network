When President Barack Obama and his family took a six-day African vacation in 2013, the United States Secret Service spent more than $2.1 million to protect them, according to documents from inside the Department of Homeland Security.

The costs included $953,788 for the security details' hotel accommodations, with the rest chalked up to actual security costs – and 'entertainment.'

The total of $2,189,727 – separate from the whopping $8,104,224 in flight expenses – also included $11,525 spent on preparations for a safari side-trip in Tanzania that the White House later canceled.

The safari was scotched, in part, because the White House feared putting the first family on display, flanked by security forces brandishing high-powered rifles – protecting them from rampaging cheetahs instead of human threats.

Judicial Watch, a center-right watchdog group famed for its FOIA requests and the grumble-inducing lawsuits they inspire in the federal government's executive branch, released the documents Thursday.

DHS provided the documents more than 10 months after they were first requested on July 3, 2013.

'Everyone should be able to afford a $10 million trip once in a while, and at some point just throw $11,000 out the window because – oops, we changed our minds,' a Judicial Watch spokesperson told MailOnline exclusively.

'The problem is that the Obamas are not spending their own money. It is the taxpayers' money. And there is no end in sight to this brazen spending.'

The Washington Post reported last year that in Africa, 100 Secret Service agents were on hand 'as "post-standers" – to man security checkpoints and borders around the president – in each of the first three cities he visits.'

'Sixty-five are needed to meet up with Obama in Dar es Salaam,' the Post added, working from a classified planning document. 'In addition, 80 to 100 additional agents will be flown in to work rotating shifts, with round-the-clock coverage, for Obama's and his family's security details.'

Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement that 'the Obamas clearly either do not understand the value of a dollar.'

However, he added, they 'understand it all too well when someone else is picking up the tab.'

'Keep in mind,' Fitton said, 'that this outrageously lavish excursion came at the very same time that the president was shutting down White House tours and blaming it on the [2013 budget] sequester.'

'As one congressional critic noted at the time, the White House could have 1,350 weeks of tours for the cost of the Obama family’s trip to Africa.'

In the 
weeks before the trip, the White House faced uncharacteristically stern 
questions from reporters about the journey's purpose and cost.

During a press briefing on June 14, 2013, Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told the White House press corps that 'the president is not going to retreat from an entire continent.'

'We don't determine the cost of the president's security, just as President Bush didn't and President Clinton didn't,' Rhodes insisted.

The Secret Service is going to do what they think is necessary to protect the president. That's going to come with its own costs. But we don't sit here and say we want to spend X amount of money on a trip.'

'Frankly,' he added, 'it will be a great bang for our buck.'
