Wales captain Ashley Williams was frustrated after wasting one of his side's best chances as they drew 0-0 with Bosnia and Herzegovina in European Championship qualifying.

While the hosts had to rely on a good display from goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey at one end, they could have won the game at the other.

Williams and Hal Robson-Kanu produced extraordinary headed misses from Gareth Bale corners, while the Real Madrid star's ferocious swerving drive was brilliantly saved by Asmir Begovic at the end.

'I can't believe it,' Williams told Sky Sports 5. 'I got a little bit in front of it and had to come back a bit but I should have scored.'

Manager Chris Coleman joked: 'Ashley WIlliams is one of the best defenders I've seen in Wales football but we need to have a word with him because when he attacks corners he looks like he's defending them.

'Alright, he missed the header, but how many times did he get us out of trouble at the other end?

'We need to keep clean sheets if we're going to do anything. The lads were throwing their heads in front of shots there and we need to have that mentality.'

Hennessey made a stunning point-blank save from Haris Medunjanin and also denied Edin Dzeko on several occasions, but he too paid tribute to the defence in front of him.

He said: 'It was a great performance, not just me but the whole back three, back five.

'We knew Bosnia were a good team but these boys were fantastic tonight.'
