'Unacceptable': Chair of the public accounts committee Margaret Hodge (pictured) said: 'Every pound that is lost to fraud and corruption is a pound that could have been spent on educating a child'

Millions of pounds of British aid money could be lost to crooks and fraudsters because of 'unacceptably poor' controls on corruption, MPs warn today.

The Commons public accounts committee warns the Department for International Development (Dfid) needs to impose 'much tougher' scrutiny of money channelled through the private sector.

MPs said they had heard evidence that millions of pounds was spent on projects with links to known fraudsters.

They highlighted a £20 million investment in a power plant project in Ivory Coast, in which one company had alleged links to the notorious fraudster James Ibori, the former Wickes cashier who was jailed for 13 years in 2012 for a £50 million fraud.

MPs also raised concerns about a £20 million investment in a gas plant in Nigeria, involving a company allegedly involved in 'looting Nigerian oil revenues'.

The UK is the biggest donor to the Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG) - which was set up to invest in infrastructure projects in developing countries - with total support expected to reach £860 million by 2017.

Today's report says the PIDG was beset by 'poor financial management', lavish travel spending, and doubts about the integrity of its investments.

Committee chairman Margaret Hodge said: 'It is essential for public confidence in spending on overseas aid that Dfid is able to demonstrate that UK taxpayers' money is being used for its intended purpose - of helping the world's poorest people - and not ending up in the wrong hands.

'Every pound that is lost to fraud and corruption is a pound that could have been spent on educating a child, improving health systems or supporting economic development.

'We recognise that PIDG operates in countries where standards of governance can be challenging. However the department's oversight of PIDG has been unacceptably poor and has left it open to questions about the integrity of PIDG's investments and some of the companies with which it works.'

A Dfid spokesman rejected the claims, saying there was 'absolutely no evidence' of wrongdoing linked to the companies involved in either the Ivory Coast or Nigeria projects.

'Britain's investment in the Private Infrastructure Development Group has helped to create 200,000 jobs and driven £6.8billion of private investment into some of the world's poorest countries, developing their economies and making them less dependent on aid,' the spokesman said.

'We already have strong oversight of PIDG's activities and have recently clamped down on excessive travel rates. An independent review of their operations, backed by Britain, will ensure they continue to kick start growth in the developing world.'

But critics said the report highlighted the folly of the Government's controversial target of spending 0.7 per cent of Britain's income on aid, which has been blamed for rushed spending.

Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'Another day, another tale of international aid being handed out without proper checks or oversight.

It is becoming a familiar story and shows how ludicrous it is to put an arbitrary 0.7 per cent target on the statute book. The department must improve its handling of taxpayers' money and ensure that not a penny sent abroad is wasted or lost in the system.'

Labour last night said it had 'grave concerns' about the way money was being spent with the private sector.

Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: 'There's nothing wrong with working with the private sector. These are funds set up by a Labour government.

My question is when you scale them up this quick without changes to governance and oversight (there is) concern about where and how the money is spent.'
