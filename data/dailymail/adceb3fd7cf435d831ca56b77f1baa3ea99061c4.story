A teen who was seriously injured in a January 2014 school shooting in New Mexico has spoken out about the terrifying ordeal that has left her body riddled with 150 lead pellets.

Despite the horrific pain she endured and her continued health concerns in the wake of the shooting, Kendal Sanders, now 14, tells People that she's managed to forgive her shooter Mason Campbell, 13.

Sanders also described the paralyzing  moment she realized she and her 11-year-old schoolmate Nathaniel Tavare had been shot.

Reliving the terror: Sanders has described the paralyzing moment she realized she and her 11-year-old schoolmate Nathaniel Tavare had been shot at their middle school

Not the intended victims: Kendal and her schoolmate were shot full of lead pellets when Mason Campbell, then 12, brought a shotgun to school to kill his bully

'I looked at Mason, and he caught my eye. I guess because of all the adrenaline running through me, I didn't feel the pain of getting shot,' she told People.

The pain soon came, however. And Kendal, at just 13, had a brush with death followed by surgeries and the ongoing risks of lead slowly leeching into her body.

Through all that, Kendal has managed to forgive Campbell. 

'I know it wasn't to hurt me, and I understand where he's coming from,' she said, referring to Campbell's journal entries found after the shooting that detailed the bullied child's reasoning when he decided to show up to school with a shotgun.

Under New Mexico law, the state can charge minors as adults only if they are at least 14. Campbell received the maximum allowable punishment for his crime, which will see him in juvenile custody until he's 21.

'He did something that's going to continuously, for the rest of my life, challenge me,' Sanders told People. 'And after he gets out, he's done. But I'm never going to be completely normal, like everyone else.'

Tavarez also bears scars both physical and emotional. 

Forever changed: 'He did something that's going to continuously, for the rest of my life, challenge me,' Sanders told People. 'And after he gets out, he's done. But I'm never going to be completely normal, like everyone else'

Permanently injured: Tavarez also bears scars both physical and emotional.He spent weeks in hospitals and rehabilitation centers for treatment of wounds to his chest, heart, face and head. His vision in both eyes has been severely diminished.

Both he and Sanders testified at Campbell's trial and urged that he receive the maximum sentence.

Sanders revealed during the trial that she has more than 150 lead pellets in her body and might never be able to have children. The pellets cause lead poisoning and make her ill and tired.

'I have to see those scars every single day for the rest of my life,' she wrote. '(He) will be able to live the rest of his life the way he wants, even have a family.'

In May, the boy pleaded no contest to three counts of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and one count of carrying a firearm on school premises.

His lawyers had asked that he be placed in treatment for two years and then be released if doctors determined he was no longer a danger.

A defense memo said the boy was chronically bullied, is socially and emotionally immature, and regrets what he did.

'I'm very, very sorry,' the boy said to Tavarez and Sanders. 

The city of Roswell, pop. 50,000, was flung into chaos in the wake of the shooting, which thankfully cost no lives
