Almost half of the Coalition’s ministers are increasing the size of their empires by hiring more staff at a time of an unprecedented jobs squeeze across the rest of the public sector.

Seven government departments, including the Treasury and the Cabinet Office, increased their headcount in the three months to March, despite the austerity drive in Whitehall.

Figures compiled by the TaxPayers’ Alliance revealed wide variations, with Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary Ed Davey overseeing the largest recruitment drive and Conservative Defence Secretary Philip Hammond cutting the largest number of bureaucrats.

They cast doubt on the determination of some ministers to implement David Cameron’s promise to create a ‘leaner, swifter’ Civil Service.

By 2015, the Coalition says it will have reduced the size of  the Whitehall machine by  23 per cent.

Amid frustration at the top of the Government at the pace of reform in some areas, Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude yesterday set out provocative plans to examine a further, far-reaching shake-up of the Whitehall machine.

Independent experts will be commissioned to examine whether procedures adopted in other countries – such as forcing senior civil servants to offer their resignation when a new government is elected, or putting them on strict contracts meaning they can be dismissed if they do not reach targets set by ministers – should be copied here.

According to the TaxPayers’ Alliance report, staff numbers at the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) rose by 4 per cent from 2,816 to 2,929 between last December and March this year.

Though Chancellor George Osborne is leading the drive to rein in the public sector, the Treasury was among the departments to increase its workforce over the first quarter of this  year, with numbers rising by  2 per cent to 1,297.

The Cabinet Office, which is responsible for increasing government efficiency and Civil Service reform, increased its headcount of staff by 3 per cent to 2,097.

Other ministries to have increased the headcount of officials over the three-month period were the Foreign Office, the Department of Health, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and the Department for International Development.

At the MoD, by contrast, the total headcount of civil servants, excluding members of the Armed Forces, fell by 5 per cent between December and April from 57,210 to 54,250, according to the analysis of official figures.

Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘When the Government is supposed to be making vital reductions to the size of the public sector, it beggars belief that there are departments which have been increasing the number of Whitehall bureaucrats they employ.

Row: Campaigners claim Ed Davey 'is letting down cabinet colleagues' by not controlling staff numbers in his department

‘Ministers increasing staff numbers at departments like Energy and Climate Change and International Development are letting down their more responsible colleagues.

‘Every government department needs to work to cut the size of the Civil Service and ease the pressure on taxpayers and the frontline services on which people rely the most.’

A spokesman for DECC, which Gordon Brown created in 2008, suggested its staffing increase was explained by it being ‘a relatively new department’.

‘The department has a challenging and important agenda as set out in the spending review and posts that have been filled over the last months are necessary to enable us to meet those targets,’ he added.

A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘The number of civil servants is down 7,000 over the quarter and 43,000 over the last 12 months. Overall, Civil Service employment stands at 428,000 – a new post-Second World War low, and down from around half a million in May 2010.

‘The small increase in the Cabinet Office was due to staff transferring across from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and, as these are not new civil servants, did not cost the taxpayer anything extra.’

Ministers have been frustrated that civil servants can avoid personal responsibility for policy failures by arguing that ministers, not officials, are accountable to Parliament for everything that happens in their department.

A ministerial source said: ‘Every option is on the table. It would be very arrogant to assume that the way we govern is unimproveable. Francis Maude is very clear he wants to look at radical models.’
