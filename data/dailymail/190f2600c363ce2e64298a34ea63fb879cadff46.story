A Labour MP's wife whose popularity soared after she posted a string of selfies of her cleavage online has hit back at Twitter trolls who called her fat – by claiming the abuse motivated her to lose half a stone.

Karen Danczuk, 31, who is married to Rochdale Labour MP Simon Danczuk, 47, today uploaded two photographs of herself to Twitter with the caption: 'Can I please thank my trolls for calling me fat, I've lost over half a stone & feel fantastic KD #lastlaugh.'

It comes after a tweet posted by the 31-year-old mother of two on November 15, in which she said: 'Anyone who calls me fat are a disgrace. It's no wonder girls become anorexic. If I'm fat at a size 10 God help us. KD.'

Mrs Danczuk, 31, took to her Twitter page today to 'thank  trolls' for motivating her to lose over half a stone

Critics have attacked Mrs Danczuk's pictures but she has continued to claim they 'aren't supposed to be sexy'

The social media lover has posted dozens of photographs in recent months, mostly of her cleavage, and about 60 images alone since the beginning of July.

The Rochdale councillor's 'selfies' have attracted national attention and she has gained more than 25,000 followers since uploading the steady stream of images.

Critics have attacked Mrs Danczuk for her pictures but she has continued to address criticism and has claimed the photos 'aren't supposed to be sexy'.

Earlier this year, she said: 'I'm not an attention seeker. I don't roll out of clubs drunk. I'm not silly. I'm not a crazy party animal. I'm not a girly girl and I rarely wear make-up. In fact, I'm quite a tomboy.

'Not all my tops are low-necked. I don't wear short dresses — all my dresses are knee-length. Gosh, I've seen more flesh in the supermarket than I have in my photos.'

In August, she was forced to defend herself after becoming embroiled in a bitter row with former Tory MP Louise Mensch - over the pictures of her cleavage.

On November 15, the councillor uploaded this image to Twitter blasting those who criticised her weight

Mrs Mensch described the councillor in her newspaper column as 'Westminster's most embarrassing wife'.

The former MP, who moved to New York with her music manager husband Peter after stepping down from Parliament, also said: 'She can't stop posting pictures of her cleavage on Twitter, cheapening women in politics.'

However, Mrs Danczuk hit back at the claims and accused Mrs Mensch of being 'obsessed' with her chest and called on her to stop 'b****ing' about other women in politics. 

She also claimed her husband – who she owns a deli with in Rochdale - was proud of the attention she received, something which he reiterated by reposting one her online tweets with the caption: 'Proud of my wife — brains and beauty!' 

The pair married in 2012 and have two sons together, Milton, six, and Maurice, four.

Mrs Danczuk is married to Labour MP for Rochdale Simon Danczuk, 47, and the pair have two children
