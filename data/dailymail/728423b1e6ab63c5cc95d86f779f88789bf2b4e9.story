Great Britain's Chris Froome has been ruled out of the Tirreno-Adriatico stage race for health reasons.

'Still not feeling well so won't be making it to #TirrenoAdriatico2015 Really disappointed but health comes first,' the 2013 Tour de France winner posted on Twitter. He has been suffering from a chest infection.

The seven day race, which begins on Wednesday in Italy, was highly anticipated as the top four Tour de France favourites - Froome, Spain's Alberto Contador, Colombian Nairo Quintana and defending Tour de France champion Vincenzo Nibali of Italy - were scheduled to compete.

Froome told the BBC: 'I've been ill for a few days now and, unfortunately, I couldn't shake it off in time.'

Froome should, however, 'be fine' to race in the Volta a Catalunya, which begins on 23 March.

He added: 'After speaking with the doctors we decided as a precaution that it would be best to take a few days off the bike to recover fully.

'This is obviously frustrating after the good start that I've had to the season, but it's a minor setback.'

The 2013 Tour de France champion is targeting a return to racing in Catalonia later this month
