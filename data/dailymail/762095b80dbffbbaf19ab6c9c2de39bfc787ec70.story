Chancellor George Osborne out jogging in St James Park today, before announcing in the Commons plans to advertise the Governor job

George Osborne yesterday fired the starting gun on the race to become the next Governor of the Bank of England.

The Chancellor said the job will be advertised on Friday and an appointment made by the end of the year.

The successful candidate will take over from Sir Mervyn King and become one of the most influential figures in Britain.

The Bank, which already sets interest rates, is being handed sweeping powers to oversee the UK’s financial system.

Critics claim the Bank and its senior officials, who are unelected, wield too much power and senior MPs last night questioned the selection process.

Sir Mervyn – who is on an annual salary of £305,368 and will leave with a pension paying £198,200 a year – retires after ten years as  Governor next June.

His successor is likely to be paid even more as it has become a  bigger and tougher job.

The choice could be controversial. David Cameron and Mr Osborne will be wary of bankers tainted by the financial crisis and the scandals that have rocked the industry. Sources close to the Chancellor said the successful candidate will need to be ‘someone who will not be pulled apart’ by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee who will quiz the new Governor.

Given the tarnished reputation of some leading banks, that could rule out former Barclays chief John Varley and ex-HSBC boss Lord (Stephen) Green, now a trade minister.

Frontrunners include Paul Tucker, deputy governor at the Bank, Lord (Adair) Turner, head of the Financial Services Authority, and former Cabinet Secretary Lord (Gus) O’Donnell. Sources said there was nothing to stop someone from abroad getting the job, with Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney highly rated.

The Chancellor told the House of Commons the job will be advertised for the first time to ensure a ‘fair and open competition’.

It will be up to an interview panel – chaired by Sir Nicholas Macpherson, permanent secretary to the Treasury – to draw up a shortlist.

The appointment will be made by the Queen on the recommendation of the Prime Minister and Chancellor. The new Governor will serve one term of eight years ‘ensuring the appointment will span at least two parliaments and will not be subject to undue political influence’.

Mr Osborne said Sir Mervyn had been an ‘outstanding’ Governor who had helped the UK economy through ‘one of its most challenging periods in modern history’.

Labour MP John Mann, who sits on the Treasury Select Committee, said it was of ‘critical’ importance that MPs had a say in selecting the new Governor.

He added: ‘The Governor has unprecedented powers of action in the UK economy and the Chancellor has failed to match the growth in parliamentary democracy that has evolved in recent times.

‘This was an opportunity for George Osborne to extend equivalent powers of interview to elected politicians but instead he has kept the appointment in the hands of leading government officials.

‘He is fearful of politicians holding the new appointee to account and risks an unprecedented stand-off if he attempts to put a political appointee into the role.’

The name of the new Governor will be made public by the end of the year to 'provide certainty to the markets and to manage the transition'.

The new Governor will be appointed for a single eight-year term in a move described by the Treasury as intended to remove 'undue political influence'.

A Treasury source said the remuneration package would be decided by the Bank's ruling Court but they needed to remember 'we live in the times we do'.

The open nature of the contest could potentially result in an overseas applicant filling the role of governor, but the source said the successful candidate would need experience of "macro-economics and banking and obviously some knowledge of the British economy".

The source added: 'The Chancellor is very determined that we have a proper process that enables a wide field to apply and it is a process we will go through to ensure the best person gets the job.'

Former civil service head Lord O'Donnell has been tipped as a potential successor to Sir Mervyn, along with a number of City figures both inside and outside Threadneedle Street.

Mr Osborne also announced he will make his Autumn Statement to the House of Commons on December 5.
