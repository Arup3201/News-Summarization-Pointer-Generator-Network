Midwives will test women at antenatal appointments and those with high carbon monoxide readings will be given advice on how to quit smoking under the NICE guidelines

Mothers and midwives responded angrily last night to guidelines which will pressure all pregnant women to take breath tests to check if they have told the truth about smoking.

In proposals due to come into force this year, midwives will be told to test mothers’ carbon monoxide levels at their first antenatal appointment.

This will reveal if they are being honest about whether they smoke, with those found to have high readings given ‘appropriate support’ on how to quit.

It follows concerns that while up to one-fifth of women smoke during  pregnancy, many feel too embarrassed to admit it to their doctor or midwife and miss out on help to quit.

But mothers were furious at the change, proposed by health watchdog NICE, with members of website Mumsnet branding the plans ‘utter meddlesome nonsense’ and ‘intrusive nannying’.

One member said: ‘I think this is  outrageous – why aren’t pregnant women being trusted to tell the truth?’

Another commented: ‘Really terrible idea. Women are not just baby incubators once they’re pregnant.’

Although the tests will not be compulsory, mothers may feel obliged to take them after being asked to do so in hospital.

Last night midwives made it clear that the guidelines are unhelpful, saying having to carry out tests could undermine the trust between them and their patients.

Louise Silverton, director of midwifery at the Royal College of Midwives, said: ‘It is a bit draconian.

‘They are asking us to test each pregnant woman for carbon  monoxide on their very first visit.

‘It is not allowing women to say no or midwives to use their judgment. And it puts pressure on the first visit when a lot of women are already dealing with a lot of information and stress.

‘Our concerns are they may just say no. All you can really do is make sure that women understand  the risks.’

Babies born to women who smoke during pregnancy are three times more likely to have a low birth weight, which is a leading cause of infant death

Smoking during pregnancy can increase 
the risk of miscarriage, premature birth, stillbirth and sudden 
unexpected death in infancy.

Exposure
 to smoke in the womb is also associated with psychological problems in 
childhood such as lack of attention and hyperactivity.

Children of smokers tend to suffer from more respiratory problems such as asthma or bronchitis and to have problems of the ear, nose  and throat.

NICE – the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence – is concerned that women who do smoke during pregnancy may find it hard to admit to their habit because of social pressures.

In its draft recommendation, the watchdog says: ‘This makes it  difficult to ensure they are offered appropriate support. A carbon monoxide test is an immediate and non-invasive biochemical method for helping to assess whether or not someone smokes.’

Simon Clark, director of smokers’ lobby group Forest, said all mothers should be encouraged not to smoke when pregnant, but warned against putting pressure on women to take the tests. He said: ‘This seems incredibly invasive.

‘If they are going to undertake any test then it has to be entirely voluntary.

‘Our concern is what happens if  a mother says no, will she be  pressured or penalised? This could be the start of a slippery slope and it is important not to breach an individual’s privacy.’

Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives, said a lack of midwives was a major reason why many women did not get proper help to give up smoking.

‘The real solution here in cutting the prevalence of smoking in  pregnancy is more midwives and more continuity of care from the same midwife,’ Mrs Warwick said.

‘The shortage of midwives, particularly in England, means that often a midwife does not have as much time as she would want with each pregnant woman in her care and that women often see a different midwife at each visit.’

She added: ‘We would like them to make clear in any advice to women that midwives should offer the test but that ultimately the final decision must lie with the woman.’
