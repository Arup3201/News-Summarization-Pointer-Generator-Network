Rob Ford got stuck in an elevator for 45 minutes today, another unfortunate turn of events for the beleaguered Toronto Mayor who was forced to admit this week that he had an 'unfortunate' slip from sobriety.

Ford was on his way to make a speech to the Economic Club of Canada when he became trapped in a freight elevator he had taken with staffers and hotel employees 'to avoid all traffic'. Several members of the business crowd left before Ford's arrival.

Ford is having a turbulent week, starting with the emergence of a video showing him slurring his words in an odd rant against Toronto's police chief.

Watch Rob Ford in action below

Toronto mayor Rob Ford, pictured on Wednesday, admitted that he had an 'unfortunate slip' from his pledge not to drink after he was caught on camera rambling incoherently in a fast food joint

Ford was caught on camera on Monday night incoherently
 rambling in what appears to be a Jamaican accent.

A new video was 
immediately posted online of Ford swearing and talking about police 
surveillance in a fast-food restaurant.

Ford, who publicly stated he was giving up alcohol in November after he was mired in a crack-smoking
 scandal, offered no apologies for this latest incident on Wednesday 
which he calls his 'personal, private setback'. However he will 
'definitely' give up alcohol again, he said

He told the Toronto Sun on Wednesday: 'I had an unfortunate setback, a bump, Monday. I have no excuse, but I am not apologizing for it.'

He added that his 'Jamaican patois' accent was not meant to be offensive and he often talks to Jamaican friends this way.

With regards his return to drinking, he added: 'You fall off the horse, you get back on the horse. That is what I am doing.'

The video is titled 'New Video of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford Drunk, Swearing in Jamaican Patois? Bumbaclot.'

On the tape, Ford rants incoherently in 
what appears to be an imitation of a Jamaican dialect while throwing a 
series of random shapes with his arms.

Ford promised to stop drinking in November after being forced to knowledge that he 
smoked crack 'in one of my drunken stupors'.

Police said they 
had obtained a copy of a tape that appeared to show the government official smoking crack.

An undated video of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford was posted to YouTube this week where he rambles incoherently in what sounds like an imitation of Jamaican Patois

The Toronto Mayor leaves city hall on Wednesday after an embarrassing video emerged this week, forcing him to admit he had been drinking again

In a TV interview at the time, Ford said: 'I've had a come-to-Jesus moment if you want to call it that. Just the humiliation and the belittling and the people I've let down.

'And it's all because of alcohol. Excessive, stupid, immature behavior and that's it.'

Allegations about Ford smoking crack surfaced last May when reporters for the Toronto Star and one from the U.S. website Gawker said they saw the video.

Before the mayor admitted the new video had been filmed on Monday, his brother and fellow politician Doug Ford defended him by saying it was not filmed recently because his brother had stopped drinking in November.

Doug Ford said: 'He's a lot heavier in that picture than he is now...It couldn't have been last night.'

When asked whether it was appropriate for his brother to put on an accent, Doug Ford ducks the question saying he hasn't actually seen the video.

Ford gestured wildly and appeared to not know he was being filmed during his drunken rant

Earlier this month, the mayor of Canada's largest city did a 'campaign visit' to downtown nightclub Muzik, setting social media abuzz in the process.

Muzik is known party palace for both 
locals and visitors, in the past entertaining touring musicians like 
Justin Bieber as well as celebrities and sport stars.

Numerous
 photos of the 44-year-old looking hot and sweaty popped up on Instagram
 and Twitter, posted by revelers surprised to see Ford wandering around 
the dance floor.

Ford admitted that he had been drinking when the clip was filmed on Monday night

Councillor Doug Ford, the mayor's 
brother and campaign manager, said the appearance was in the name of 
drumming up support for the forthcoming election, set for October 27.

He said the mayor consumed only a sugar-free energy drink and was at the club for about an hour.

'He stopped drinking in November and he went there, met the people,' Doug Ford earlier told The Toronto Sun. 'There
 have been rock stars, there have been sports heroes, thereâ€™s been the 
Bieber there and no one got a response like Rob did.

'The place went upside down ballistic. All he did was take pictures.'

Ford was forced to apologize at a press conference for using 'graphic language' when describing sex with his wife Renata (left)
