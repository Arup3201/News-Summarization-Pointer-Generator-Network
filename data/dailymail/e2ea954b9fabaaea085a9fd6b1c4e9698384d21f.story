Radical: Mohammed Benares, a Royal Mail Worker from Birmingham, has been jailed for two years for terrorism offences

A man with links to radical Muslim preacher Anjem Choudary has been jailed for two years for terrorism offences.

Royal Mail worker Mohammed Benares, 45, had terror guides showing how to make a bomb and detonator and how to handle an AK47 assault rifle.

Benares, of Saltley, Birmingham, downloaded the terror material from the internet and stored it on three external hard drives. He also had links with another radical preacher, Abu Izzadeen.

The documents included online al Qaida magazine Inspire and step-by-step instructions on how to make a bomb ‘In the kitchen of your mom’ using readily-available ingredients.

The court heard that Benares had attended a demonstration organised by the Muslims Against Crusades group in central London on September 11, 2011 to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks.

Choudary, Izzadeen and Benares all attended the march and analysis of the defendant’s mobile phone found text messages between him and the two radical preachers.

Benares had claimed he was not an extremist, that his interest in the material found by police was just curiosity and that he wanted to understand both moderate and extreme Islam so that he could use the information to counter arguments about extremism.

When asked why he attended the demonstration, he said: ‘My aim was to highlight the plight of those injured and killed through the drone attacks in Afghanistan and other Muslim countries.’

But sentencing him at Southwark Crown Court today, judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith told him: 'Your presence on that march and text messages paint a very different picture.

'They point to you being in fact a fellow traveller with those who had more extreme views and one who is security aware.

'I do not accept that you had a merely fleeting interest in radical Islam or that you downloaded that material out of idle curiosity.'

Wearing a dark suit and tie with a white shirt, Benares looked unmoved as his sentence was read out.

Tanveer Qureshi, for the defence, said in his client’s mitigation: 'This was a misjudgment on his part and a misjudgment which he is going to pay for in a fundamental way.'

Police arrested Benares at the three-bedroom terraced house where he lived with his wife in March 2012.

His laptop, mobile telephone and three hard drives were seized and later checked.

The material gathered by officers included a document called 39 Ways to Serve and Participate in Jihad.

Southwark Crown Court, where Benares was jailed for three counts of possessing a record containing information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism

He was convicted of three counts of possessing a record containing information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism following a week-long trial last month.

Prosecutor Adina Ezekiel had previously told the court Choudary was 'a spokesman and prominent figure' of an organisation called Al Ghurabaa, which was banned in July 2006.

Choudary was also leader of Al Muhajiroun, of which Al Ghurabaa is a splinter group. Al Muhajiroun was proscribed as a terrorist organisation in January 2010.

Abu Izzadeen, who was born Trevor Brooks, was an Al Ghurabaa spokesman, the court heard.
