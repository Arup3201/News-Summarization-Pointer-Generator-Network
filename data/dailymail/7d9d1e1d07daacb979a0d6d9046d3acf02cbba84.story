Liverpool remain keen on Radamel Falcao but they face competition from Juventus for the Monaco striker.

The Italians like the idea of a loan deal and are considering the sale of Fernando Llorente to Valencia, although the Spaniard is not overly keen. 

Real Madrid maintain an interest in Falcao but need to sell another non-EU player first.

Liverpool have the option of a deal for Samuel Eto'o also but their main concern is whether he is too much of a spent force.

Reds defender Daniel Agger is an option for Atletico Madrid should they lose Toby Alderweireld, while another defender, Tiago Ilori, will move from Anfield to Bordeaux on loan on Monday - as reported last week.

Option: Liverpool could sign former Chelsea striker Samuel Eto'o on a free transfer this summer

Assou-Ekotto free to go, say Tottenham 

Tottenham are willing to let Benoit Assou Ekotto leave on a free transfer.

The Cameroon defender has been pushed down the pecking order by the arrival of Ben Davies from Swansea while Danny Rose has also signed a new long-term deal.

Assou-Ekotto had a spell on loan at QPR last season but failed to reach the performance levels he showed two and three years ago while under Harry Redknapp at White Hart Lane.

The 30-year-old has one year left on contract but Tottenham are willing to cut their losses as they streamline their squad.

Tottenham have plenty of interest in Andros Townsend with Southampton and QPR having made enquiries but Mauricio Pochettino wants to keep the England winger as part of his first team squad.

Other enquiries have been made for Michael Dawson, Kyle Naughton, Lewis Holtby, Vlad Chiriches, Nacer Chadli, Sandro and Roberto Soldado.

Tottenham maintain an interest in Morgan Schneiderlin, Memphis Depay, Mateo Musacchio and Jay Rodriguez among others but Pochettino is not keen to make drastic changes to his squad.

He said: 'I've been made aware of some reports claiming we are looking to sell half of our squad. We are fortunate to have a squad full of quality, as I have said on numerous occasions, and we are not expecting to see much movement before the end of the transfer window. 

'We will loan out some of our younger players to help further their development. Several of our players are under 21 so we don’t envisage a problem meeting the Premier League’s squad limit of 25.'

Reus will leave Dortmund for 'big club' says Beckenbauer

Franz Beckenbauer has angered Borussia Dortmund by hinting they will struggle to hold on to Marco Reus.

The honorary Bayern Munich president believes that Reus will leave Dortmund in 2015 with his release clause set at £20m for either his side or 'a big club' like Manchester United or Real Madrid.

Talking to German publication Bild, he said: 'I can imagine him at Bayern very well. If you can get a player of his class, you need to try it. If he doesn't go to Bayern in 2015, he will probably go to another big club like Real Madrid or Manchester United.

'Dortmund will probably not be able to hold on to him. I can understand why Dortmund don't like discussion about Reus. The amount of the release clause probably wasn't a big secret,' he argued. 'Every interested party probably knew it.'

They do now, Franz.

Zuculini poised to join Valencia on loan from City 

Manchester City new boy Bruno Zuculini is poised to join Valencia on loan after red tape prevented a temporary move to Sunderland.

The 21-year-old midfielder, who arrived in a £3m deal from Argentinian side Racing Club last month, is not able to join a Premier League club and then immediately move to another on loan due to Financial Fair Play legislation and is now heading to La Liga.

Deportivo La Coruna had been considered favourites for Zuculini but will now miss out. They have asked to take Fulham striker Kostas Mitroglou on loan.

Anderlecht have asked to loan City's Belgian defender Dedryck Boyata.

Norwich sign former Sunderland defender Cuellar 

Norwich City are signing former Sunderland and Aston Villa defender Carlos Cuellar. The Spaniard is undergoing a medical on Monday ahead of penning a two-year contract.

Cuellar, 32, has been training with Blackburn Rovers recently. Norwich are also in talks to sign Cameron Jerome for £2m from Stoke City. Celtic had also shown an interest in Jerome who was on loan at Crystal Palace last season.

Norwich's Holland midfielder Leroy Fer is expected to join QPR for £8million this week.

Villa, meanwhile, are among clubs looking at a deal for attacking midfielder Sebastian Blanco.

The 26-year-old Argentina international plays for Metallist Kharkiv but wants to quit the club following the continued unrest in the Ukraine. Despite being valued at £6million, a deal can be struck for around half the price. 

Kenny leaves Leeds after being frozen out

Paddy Kenny has left Leeds United. The 36-year-old was expected to move on and has now agreed a deal to go by mutual consent.

Kenny wasn't even on the bench for the Championship matches with Millwall and Middlesbrough, or the Capital One Cup clash with Accrington.

Leeds United’s bid for Kieran Agard collapsed on Monday after the club and the winger failed to agree personal terms.

Agard travelled to Leeds for talks this morning after Rotherham United accepted a bid last night but the move has fallen through. The 24-year-old’s agent, Lee Payne. of Full Contact, told the Yorkshire Evening Post: 'We just haven’t been able to agree personal terms.

'Leeds were hopeful of getting him signed in time to play (against Middlesbrough) tomorrow but they were keeping their offer within a budget and we couldn’t agree to it.'

Leeds do, however, hope to strike agreement on a £1m deal for Ternana striker Mirco Antenucci and are discussing a possible loan for Cagliari's Brazilian playmaker Adryan who was had talks with Manchester United in 2012.

Bamford and Baker given freedom of the Boro 

Chelsea starlet Patrick Bamford will join Middlesbrough on Monday and coach Aitor Karanka hopes to finalise the signing of the Blues' Under 21 captain Lewis Baker in the coming days.

Baker is very highly thought of at Stamford Bridge with Jose Mourinho even stating he will have failed as a coach if the 19-year-old does not become a full England international in years to come. Chelsea had intended to give him more games with their first team but Karanka will be able to offer even more consistent game time.

Everton and West Ham lead chase for Amalfitano 

Everton, West Ham, Hull, Sunderland and Crystal Palace have expressed an interest in Marseille midfielder Morgan Amalfitano was in the stands at Loftus Road on Saturday to watch Hull City take on QPR.

Amalfitano is available on a free transfer after an ugly fall out with coach Marcelo Bielsa that has culminated in the player being told to stay away from the Marseille training ground.

The 29-year-old had a productive loan spell at West Bromwich Albion last season and is in London ahead of talks with Premier League clubs.

West Ham have already spoken with his representatives and are considered favourites to reach an agreement.

Everton are considering a number of options following the injury to midfielder Ross Barkley.

Fulham in talks with Hildebrand 

Fulham have opened talks with former Germany goalkeeper Timo Hildebrand.

The 35-year-old is a free agent after leaving Schalke and is well known to coach Felix Magath.

Hildebrand's last visit to London did not leave a favourable impression as his blunder allowed Samuel Eto'o to score the opening goal for Chelsea in their 3-0 Champions League defeat of Schalke in November.

However, Magath wants an experienced keeper to help his young players. He gave a debut to 21-year-old Finland man Jesse Joronen in goal on the opening day of the season after selling David Stockdale to Brighton and allowing Maarten Stekelenburg to join Monaco on loan.
