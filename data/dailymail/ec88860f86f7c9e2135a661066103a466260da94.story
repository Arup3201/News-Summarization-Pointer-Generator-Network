The frontrunner to replace Nick Clegg as Liberal Democrat leader has savaged the way his party has conducted itself in coalition with the Tories – saying it deserves just ‘two out of 10’.

In a thinly-veiled attack on the Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Farron said the party should have been much braver and blocked the Conservatives’ controversial health reforms.

The MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale acknowledged that the party will lose many of his seats at the election – saying he was looking forward to the ‘thrill of rebuilding’.

But he said that, despite this fall in Parliamentary strength, he would demand the same number of Cabinet ministers in any new coalition agreement.

The arch comments will be seen as the latest stage in Mr Farron’s undeclared bid for leadership of the party should it suffer a catastrophe on 7 May.

The Lib Dems won 57 seats at the 2010 election, meaning that when they went into Coalition with the Conservatives, they were able to argue for five Cabinet places.

But the polls are so bad now – one even put the Lib Dems on 5 per cent – that the party is projected to lose half his seats in May. Some even expect Mr Clegg to lose his Sheffield Hallam seat.

In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Farron said the Lib Dems should ‘actively consider’ something short of a full coalition if the general election results in a hung parliament.

He told the paper that he believed the party would hang on to well over half of the 57 seats they won in 2010. But he said he was already preparing to pick up the pieces. ‘What I’m absolutely ready for — you may as well be excited by it — is the thrill of rebuilding,’ he said.

If Mr Clegg goes after the election, Mr Farron is seen as the front-runner to succeed him. Potential rivals such as Vince Cable, the business secretary, care minister Norman Lamb, and Ed Davey, the energy secretary, are seen as less likely to win.

Mr Farron told the FT that while another coalition is possible, the Lib Dems should consider letting David Cameron or Ed Miliband form a minority government.

He said the Lib Dems believe that while ‘stable government is absolutely essential’, coalition is not the only answer. ‘You really have got to be ready to walk away,’ he said.

Mr Farron said the price for any formal deal should be for the Lib Dems to take ownership of one particular part of government policy.

‘For me it would be infrastructure renewal,’ he said. ‘It’s about the hard development of a kind of Victorian-style infrastructure revolution,.

‘We’re talking about South Korean levels of broadband, 3million new homes — almost all of them affordable — over a 10-year period.’

Defence: Mr Farron insisted that forming the Coalition had been the ‘grown-up’ thing to do and said his party should not be ‘punished’. Above, David Cameron and Nick Clegg outside No 10 after the 2010 election

The former Lib Dem party president said that if the Lib Dems did agree to a coalition, he would expect the party to hold as many ministerial posts as now — even if the party has far fewer MPs.

‘I’m not going to give away any ministerial seats without a massive fight,’ he said.

While he said the party deserves ‘eight out of 10’ for the way it handled the coalition negotiations in 2010, he suggested that Mr Clegg should have been more robust with the Tories in government.

‘You’re not going to bring the government down on something like the NHS reforms if you say no, it’s not happening,’ he said.

Mr Farron gave the party a score of just ‘two out of 10’ for how it had handled its time in coalition. And he said Mr Clegg should have understood the damage the party’s U-turn on tuition fees would inflict.

But he insisted the party was right to go into coalition at a time of national economic emergency in 2010 and says it would be regrettable if the party was now ‘punished for it’.

He said the UK Independence party, the Greens and the Scottish National party might draw the conclusion that voters did not reward parties that ‘behaved like a grown up’.

He adds: ‘If that is the message that’s communicated — that parties that behave in a decent way get hammered for it — that is a great worry.’
