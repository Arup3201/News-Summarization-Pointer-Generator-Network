Three teenagers risked their lives as they rode an air mattress is fast-flowing flood waters while rescuers desperately searched for a teenage boy swept away in the same storm.

The boys were caught on an air mattress in a canal in Henderson, Nevada, cheering and waving to a news helicopter crew on Wednesday before police ordered them ashore.

Meanwhile William Mootz, 17, had gone missing down a drainage wash in the same town, located 
southeast of the Las Vegas strip.

Flooded Over: The storm swept the whole of the southwest, leading to the rescue of two people reportedly stranded in a van in high waters in Phoenix

Two other people were rescued 
from a van stranded in high water in suburban Phoenix as heavy rains in 
the Southwest flooded ditches and roads.

Family and friends gathered on Thursday in Henderson to look for William who disappeared after falling into a flood channel the day before. The wash had filled quickly after a morning downpour.

The 17-year-old was hanging out with friends when he fell into the Pittman Wash, which meanders past a shopping mall and his high school, police said. The teen apparently didn't intend to get in.

'I think they were just going out there to look at the raging water in the washes,' Henderson police spokesman Keith Paul said.

Family members say the high school senior is a strong swimmer and has emergency preparedness experience.

More
than a dozen Henderson police officers walked up and down the wash with
guidance from city public works employees who know how water typically 
flows down the channel. In all, about 100 volunteers were helping 40 
police, firefighters and city employees look for Mootz.

Holding Out Hope: Family, friends and police were still searching Thursday along the drainage wash in Henderson into which a 17-year-old boy fell Wednesday morning during the heavy rains

A Concerted Search: cleared an estimated 15 tons of dirt and debris from a more than mile-long, concrete-lined portion of the wash before turning their attention to a wider, muddy marsh farther downstream

They cleared an estimated 15 tons of dirt and debris from a more than mile-long, concrete-lined portion of the wash before turning their attention to a wider, muddy marsh farther downstream. Rainwater in the wash ultimately drains into Lake Mead.

The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department was helping the effort with a helicopter. The chopper was being used to fly searchers into otherwise inaccessible parts of the mucky wetland.

'More than anything else, it's the use of the Metro Police helicopter that's very helpful in searching a large area quickly,' Paul said.

Deadly Misstep: Mootz was hanging out with friends when he somehow fell into the Pittman Wash, which meanders past a shopping mall and his high school, police said. The teen apparently didn't intend to get in

In the Phoenix area, flooded roads led to a dramatic rescue Thursday morning. A driver and her disabled passenger had to be pulled from a medical transport van that was stranded after the driver tried to navigate a flooded Scottsdale wash.

Firefighters used a ladder truck, and news video showed the driver and passenger climbing out of a van stopped in the middle of a flooded area.

Heavy rains hit much of Arizona early Thursday, with more than an inch reported in an hour in parts of metropolitan Phoenix.

Normally dry washes were rushing like major rivers. Some neighborhoods were flooded, and parts of Interstate 10 on the city's western side were inundated, snarling traffic during the morning commute.
