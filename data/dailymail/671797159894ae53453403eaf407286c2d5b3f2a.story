A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a teenage boy was discovered near an east London playing field.

Police believe the 18-year old died after a fight. Four men and a woman have been arrested.

Officers were called shortly before 11pm last night to Broadmead Fields in Woodford, east London, where they found the body.

A police spokesman said: 'At this early stage it is believed an altercation took place that led to the victimâ€™s death.'

The men arrested are 26, 19, 20 and 29. The woman is 20. All are being held in custody.

A post-mortem is due to take place tomorrow.

Police are appealing for anyone who saw anything suspicious, in particular a blue Fiat Punto in Courtland Close or activity near the bridge in Chigwell Road close to the Jet petrol station from Sunday evening through to Monday night.

Locals say the fight took place in the field behind the estate, which has an old pair of goalposts on it, shortly before the death.

The boy has not been named by police but residents say he is not believed to be from the local estate. No cause of death has been given.

He is the third teenager to be murdered in the capital this year

One said: 'We heard some sort of argument last night in the field. There was shouting, there was some sort of fight was going on. I couldn't see it so I couldn't tell how many people were involved.

'I head a loud bang and this happened after that.

'They were having a fight in the field and then I heard that someone was stabbed nearby, so it could have been a retaliation.

'I've heard from people in the estate that he's not someone we know, he's not from the estate.'

Another local, who also asked not to be named, said: 'My neighbour was walking his dog around 7am by the river and he saw a load of blood. It's all cordoned off now.'

Forensics officers today sealed off the area where the body was found - a path which leads down to a small river - and placed a large black tent over the scene as well as collecting and bagging evidence.

The path running between the Jet garage and the estate was also sealed off.
