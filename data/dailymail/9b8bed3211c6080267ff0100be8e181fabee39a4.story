It may be the NFL's loudest stadium, but when Derrick Coleman lines up to play in the NFC Championship game at CenturyLink Field on Sunday, he will only feel a distant rumble.

That is because the Seahawks running back is the first legally deaf player in the NFL - and he has overcome bullies, doubts and being overlooked in the draft to get there.

The 23-year-old from Los Angeles said people putting him down because of his disability has only made him more determined to reach his goal.

'When people say, "Oh you can't do this", it's more motivation for me,' he told ABC News. '[I say] "Okay, watch me".'

Determined: The Seahawks' Derrick Coleman, 23, is the first legally deaf player ever to play for the NFL

Coleman lost his hearing when he was just three years old, due to a genetic and incurable hearing impairment.

In a commercial he recently filmed for Duracell batteries, he explained that he had grown up with people telling him he would be unable to achieve his dream of playing football.

'They told me it couldn't be done, that I
 was a lost cause,' he says in the commercial, which became an internet sensation after its release.

'I was picked on and picked last. Coaches didn't 
know how to talk to me. They gave up on me, told me I should just quit... But I've been deaf since I
 was three so I didn't listen.'

Tough years: Coleman lost his hearing when he was three, due to a genetic hearing impairment, and went on to suffer bullying, he said. People told him he would not be able to make it as a football player

Winner: But he was a star football player at high school, pictured, and went on to play for UCLA

Coleman continued to play football through high school before playing for UCLA. He was not picked in the draft when he graduated - but has since proven to the NFL that he is a star player.

After signing up as a Free Agent with the Minnesota Vikings in May 2012, he was taken on by the Seattle Seahawks in December 2012 and made the 2013 season cut.

He has learned to be creative on the field in the face of his struggles.

When his hearing aids didn't fit properly inside of his helmet, his mother used a pair of her pantyhose so they would stay put, and to cut down on the feedback, ABC reported.

And he taught himself how to lip read so that he can understand last-minute plays from quarterback Russell Wilson, who turns around to mouth the words in his direction.

Moving: He recently appeared in a powerful commercial for Duracell that detailed his fight to the top

'I can rely on reading lips,' he said. 'That's the 
advantage that most people don't have. They don'’t know how to read lips —
 like when the hearing goes out what do you do? They kind of freak out.'

He scored his first NFL touchdown on December 2, 2013 - to a roar from the crowd.

'I can hear [the fans],' he said. 'I can definitely hear them. It don't hurt my ears as much as everyone else's but I know it's loud.'

He appeared in 12 games this season, mostly as a blocker and special teamer, and he will appear on the field on Sunday when the Seahawks battle the San Francisco 49ers.

'He does his job impeccably well in all areas and everything that we ask of him,' Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said.

Impressive: Coleman will play with the Seahawks against the 49ers Sunday in the NFC championship game

Tactics: Quarterback Russell Wilson (#3) leans towards Coleman so he can read his lips during a game

Strong: He said that he reads teammates' lips to understand plays while on the field

'He’s a terrific effort guy. He’s 
been a fantastic part of the team and it’s been a really cool story. Not
 because he has issues, because he’s made this team and he’s made a spot
 for himself and he’s claimed it. The fact that he has a hearing issue 
is really not even something that we deal with.'

Coleman added the one thing he happily will not listen to is people judging him for being deaf.

'That's who I am,' he said. 'It made me who I am today.'
