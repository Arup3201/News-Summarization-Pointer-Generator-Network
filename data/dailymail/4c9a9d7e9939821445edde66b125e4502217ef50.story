His assessment - that the atmosphere at Stamford Bridge ‘is getting worse’ - was brutal, but Jose Mourinho has a knack of hitting upon issues Chelsea fans want addressing. Despite sitting top and unbeaten, these supporters aren't all a merry bunch.

Going to home games wasn't what it once was. The place is flat and the club don't seem sure how to fix the problems. To suggest this is down to apathy or complacency is lazy - there is more to it than that.

Mourinho has clearly noticed it. ‘Playing here is like playing in an empty stadium,’ was his damning verdict after a relatively soulless afternoon in which the leaders picked up another three points in their pursuit of regaining the Premier League crown.

Eden Hazard scored his fifth penalty since January. Only Frank Lampard (six) has scored more for Chelsea in a Premier League calendar year 

The dig wasn’t so thinly-veiled - the manager clearly stated he believes the Blues are the worst supported club at home in the division.

Chelsea supporters are, quite rightly, insulted by that. But they also realise travelling to SW6 is intimidating because of the team Mourinho sends out and not a lot else.

Pricing strategies and the way in which this club’s image has transformed since Roman Abramovich’s arrival are obvious contributive factors to a damp environment. The clientele is unrecognisable to those who witnessed a goalless draw against West Ham here 15 years ago this week.

‘I think it’s getting worse,’ Mourinho said, shaking his head. ‘When comparing to my previous time I think it’s getting worse.

‘I can clearly say we are the team to get less support in home matches. I don’t question the passion and the love - I’m nobody to question that and I know clearly that’s not true.

‘Chelsea fans show us their passion for this club every day, but there is a certain line of living (way of behaving) at the matches at Stamford Bridge.’

Mourinho definitely struck upon something there. Now a day at the Bridge has an almost West End feel to it. Those paying their extortionate amounts of money expect to be entertained in the same way a theatre lover would be in the evening.

The issue of money is never far away. 'It's £50-plus to go,' said Chelsea Supporters' Trust chairman Tim Rolls. 'And young people - who are the most likely to sing and make noise - have been priced out of the game.' The most expensive adult ticket on general sale this weekend was £75, with the cheapest at £46.

The BBC's recent Price of Football survey found that Chelsea's cheapest match-day ticket was the costliest in the country; only London rivals Arsenal and Tottenham sell season tickets that are more exorbitant than Abramovich's club.

Chelsea supporters want this issue tackling. Mourinho refused to go into detail as to why he felt the atmosphere had subsided, but fans believe it can be rectified by new policies surrounding pricing, stewarding, singing sections and safe standing.

‘The team then starts playing like it’s a quiet, soft game at home,’ added Mourinho. The manager himself must, however, take on some of the blame. It was the Portuguese’s decision back in 2005 to move away fans from behind his dugout in the East Stand Lower to the Shed End. That divided the raucous section behind the goal and it’s never recovered.

One disgruntled fan wrote an impassioned letter to John Terry on instagram on Sunday to relay his anger at Mourinho’s comments. The captain vowed to get back in touch with answers. Those at the club know what’s going on but appear powerless to stop it.

And their team were flat on Saturday. It was the first time of a season that bares all the hallmarks of a procession to the title that they didn’t have it all their own way at home. 

Harry Redknapp’s QPR showed the sort of  steel they’ll need as we head into the new year; they were set up to stifle and did so admirably for large parts. Redknapp will also be pleased that Nedum Onuoha, Joey Barton and Jordon Mutch return to training this week and Charlie Austin continues to find the net.

But Mourinho was visibly agitated throughout. First he wasn’t happy with the lack of floodlights on a gloomy afternoon in west London, then his players were handed a dressing down at the break - despite leading.

‘At half-time he was not happy and told us we hadn't played well and had to do better, Willian said. ‘It was dangerous for us, to be only 1-0 up. So we had to improve. He was right because even then QPR came on to the pitch for the second half and scored their goal to get level.

‘But at least we reacted. We had to. We had to run more, keep the ball better, get at them more.’

Mourinho’s scathing attack on his own supporters may have been unwitting, but it’s amplified a growing unrest of a group whose lack of voice has drawn attention to their ongoing plight.
