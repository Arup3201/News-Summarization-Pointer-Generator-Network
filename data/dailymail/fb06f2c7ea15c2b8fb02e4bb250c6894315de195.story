Brendan Rodgers has boldly predicted Liverpool will be serious title challengers next year and wants a trophy this season to kick-start their push.

Liverpool have started to show glimpses of the form that saw them compete with Manchester City last year and go into Saturday’s FA Cup fourth-round tie against Bolton having lost just one of their last 15 matches.

A number of the signings Rodgers made last summer — Alberto Moreno, Lazar Markovic and Emre Can — have started to make a difference and the manager believes that augurs well.

Rodgers is adamant they will leave their inconsistencies behind in 2015-16 and wants to see his squad collect silverware.

‘The reality was with so many changes we were not going to win the league this season. We’ll be ready to challenge for the title next year,’ said Rodgers, who ruled Daniel Sturridge out of a return to action against Bolton. ‘This year was about targeting the top four and the cups. This squad has Premier League-winning capabilities. 

'We have young players who can grow. A win in the cup would provide greater stimulus. You need ready-made quality as well, but this was the year for players to adapt and settle. Come the summer the period of integration will be complete and we can compete like we did last year for the title.

‘We’ve shown in the last 13 or 14 games the restructuring of the team to make us a creative threat is there. If it continues, and we can add one or two, then we’ve got the foundation to challenge.’

Rodgers hopes to keep Glen Johnson, whose contract runs out in the summer and said in November he wouldn’t ‘go crawling’ to the club for a new deal. The 30-year-old right back could return from a thigh problem against Bolton and Rodgers said: ‘He is happy to work with the club to find a solution to stay. He loves being here.’

Meanwhile, Parma president Ermir Kodra has said they were ‘very close’ to signing striker Mario Balotelli earlier this month.
