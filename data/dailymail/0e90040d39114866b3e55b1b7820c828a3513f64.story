Shocked: The Duke of Cambridge was said to be 'appalled' at the 'senseless' killing

Prince William has been left 'appalled' by the slaughter of his friend's rhino which was killed by poachers for his prized horn.

Endangered white rhinoceros Max was shot 17 times and had his horn hacked off by hunters in Kenya.

Despite rangers removing most of his horn as a protective measure against poachers, he was hunted for the small piece still remaining.

Six-year-old Max, who was featured in the documentary Last Chance To See, had been hand-reared by Ian Craig - the father of Prince William's ex-girlfriend Jecca.

Mr Craig owns the Lewa wildlife reserve in Kenya but the animal had been moved to the Ol Pejeta sanctuary after he reached adulthood, which is where the killing took place.

In 2001 the Duke of Cambridge spent six weeks volunteering at Mr Craig's conservation project and he met Max several times on later trips to Africa.

It was after his seeing Mr Craig's work with rhinos that Prince William became a patron of the Tusk Trust, which works to protect the animals.

A St James's
 Palace spokesman said: 'The Duke of Cambridge is appalled to hear about
 this senseless slaughter. He remains very concerned about rhino and 
elephant poaching and has asked Tusk Trust to keep him updated on this 
issue in Africa.'

Poachers kill rhino for their horns, which sell for £40,00 a kilo in Asia where it is wrongly believed to cure cancer.

Charlie Mayhew, co-founder of the Tusk Trust, said: 'Max's
 slaughter by poachers is a shocking illustration of what is now 
happening the length and breadth of Africa to meet the growing demand 
for rhino horn in China and Vietnam.

'The
 fact that this rhino had been hand reared at Lewa meant that many 
visitors to Lewa including our Royal Patron had the opportunity to get 
extremely close to him. It of course makes it all the more shocking and 
sad when you know the individual animal that has been poached.

Butchered: Despite the fact that most of Max's prized horn had already been removed to protect him from poachers, he was killed for the remainder of it

'When Max grew up, he was moved to another sanctuary where he was killed.

'The
 Prince has taken a very close interest in the escalation of rhino and 
elephant poaching and it is something he feels passionate about trying 
to halt this illegal trade.'

Mr Mayhew added that the problem of rhino-poaching was now 'pan-Africa' and said that one reserve he spent time at in Zimbabwe had lost six rhinos so far this year.

He said: 'Last
 year in South Africa alone they were losing on average a rhino every 20
 hrs to poachers. This year South Africa has already lost more than 70.

'It
 is a real crisis and one that Tusk along with a number of other 
organisations is desperately trying to tackle. Last year Tusk invested 
substantial funds to help bolster security at rhino sanctuaries such as 
Lewa.'
