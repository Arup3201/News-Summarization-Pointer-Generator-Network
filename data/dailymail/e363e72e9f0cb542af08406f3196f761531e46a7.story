Porto right-back Danilo Luiz da Silva has made light of the fight for his signature saying: ‘There are far better-looking faces than mine to be appearing all the time on the front pages of the papers but I know it’s normal that if you play well for this club then other clubs start looking at you.’

Liverpool have looked at the defender as a long-term replacement for Glen Johnson but Barcelona remain in the driving seat despite their transfer ban.

They want the 23-year-old to replace Dani Alves and current president Josep Maria Bartomeu has hired Ariedo Braida as the club’s new Sporting Director to target players who will commit to joining Barça this summer but then be prepared to wait until the January 2016 window to sign.

Danilo’s contract runs out in 2016 and he is keen to wait for the chance to play alongside compatriot Neymar at the Camp Nou.

Real Madrid are desperately trying to ambush their big La Liga rivals even though they currently have Spain international Dani Carvajal establishing himself at right back.

Despite the fact that Danilo is running his contract down with no intention of signing a new deal, Porto president Jorge Pinto da Costa sill wants a return on the £9.6m the club paid Santos for the player in 2012 and his buy-out clause is set at £37m.

Madrid are hopeful that the offer of around £15m and midfielder Casemiro who is currently on loan at the Portuguese club will help them beat Barcelona to his signature.
