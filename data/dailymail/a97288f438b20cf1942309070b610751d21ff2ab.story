It is certainly not the best of circumstances.

But newlywed couple Chavon and Will Thompson will be spending their honeymoon period in Afghanistan - on opposite sides of the war-torn country.

They only tied the knot on Saturday but soon, they will only be able to communicate through letters.

Smitten: The Army couple will have to spend their first six months of married life away from each other

The pair tied the knot at St John's Church in Goole, East Yorkshire

Mrs Thompson, 18, is a combat medic in the 3rd Medical Regiment, while Mr Thompson, 19, is based with the First Battalion Scots Guards Regiment in Catterick.

Mrs Thompson said: 'We’re going to be on opposite sides of the country and we’ve been told we’ll be out there for about six months.

'I’m upset, it will be really hard, but we’ve just got to focus on the job and just get the tasks we’re supposed to be doing done.

'While we’re there, we can phone the UK but not each other, so we’re going to write letters.

'Occasionally, you can get internet access, so we might be able to send a message on Facebook, but it isn’t very reliable.'

The couple met while training at the Keogh Barracks near Aldershot when Mrs Thompson was 17.

She added: 'I saw Will in the corridor one day and I went back to my room and told my friend I’d seen this good-looking lad.

'A few days later, I bumped into him and we got chatting.'

After leaving Keogh, the pair were both moved to Catterick.

But as Mr Thompson transferred from medics to infantry, the couple were split up and stayed in separate areas of the base.

Even though they were just yards apart, they were not allowed to see each other.

Then, in December, on a night out for Mrs Thompson's 18th birthday in Howden, Will proposed.

In love: Chavon is a combat medic in the 3rd Medical Regiment, while Will is based with the First Battalion Scots Guards Regiment in Catterick

Mr Thompson, who is from North 
Ayrshire, said: 'One day, I thought I’d just propose. I didn’t plan it 
for very long because if I’d have done that I would have got nervous and
chickened out.

'We went 
for a meal and I was really nervous. We stepped outside the restaurant 
and I was so worried, I practically threw the ring at her. I didn’t get 
down on one knee either.

She said, ‘You’re not very romantic are you?’

'But she said ‘yes’, so that’s the main thing.'

The couple married at St John’s Church in Goole, East Yorkshire on Saturday, surrounded by family and friends.

Mr Thompson is heading to Afghanistan in a few weeks and his wife will head out at the end of September.

They hope to get some leave in between and time it so they take it at the same time.

When they return, they will plan the honeymoon they have dreamed of.

Mrs Thompson said: 'We would love to go to the Caribbean.

'I want to go somewhere I can get a nice tan and go scuba diving.

'We didn’t know whether to get married before or after we went out to Afghanistan but then we decided to do it before.

'This way when we get home, we can get a house together and be a proper married couple.'
