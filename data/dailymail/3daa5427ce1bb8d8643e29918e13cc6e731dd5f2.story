An American veterinarian whose round the world trip of a lifetime was ruined in September when she was arrested in East Timor after sharing a cab with a stranger caught smuggling drugs has finally been released.

Stacey Addison of Klamath Falls, Oregon was freed on Christmas day after spending four months in a women's prison.

She is still however stuck in the country as the government will not return her passport. 

This as her mother, Bernadette Kero, begs people around the world to help and get her daughter back home, even starting a petition on Change.org. 

Finally free: After four months in prison, Stacey Addison (above) was finally released from an East Timor jail on Christmas

Stark conditions: She was incarcerated at Gleno Women's Prison where she shared a cell with several other prisoners, including a women who just gave birth to a baby, and cares for the child behind bars

False charge: She was jailed after sharing a cab with a man she did not know who was smuggling meth

CNN reports that nothing has been said by the government on when Addison might be able to return back to the United States, and when she might get her passport back.

In the meantime, she is staying with former East Timorese President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jose Ramos-Horta.

And while she appreciates his hospitality, she is very clear that she will be going home the second she gets her passport back.

'I don't think my mom would ever forgive me if I didn't come home immediately and stay for a while,' she said.

Addison planned the solo-trip to see wildlife around the world for nearly two years, and had visited Antarctica and parts of Europe before she landed in southeast Asia in early September.

On September 5, Addison was sharing a cab with a complete stranger, en route to the capital city of Dili, when she first ran into trouble.

'The other passenger said he wanted to pick up a package at DHL and when he came out, the police swarmed it and she was terrified,' Kero said. 

That package contained meth, and everyone in the car was arrested. Addison spent the next four nights in jail, and when officials eventually released her, they took her passport leaving her unable to travel outside the country.

'Police searched me, they tested my urine. Everything was negative, so I thought its okay, it will be okay - but it's not,' Addison said.

She remained positive since her computer records turned up clean and she had no criminal record.

Getting home: Now, Addison is still forced to stay in the country as the government has not returned her passport

State Department spokesman Jen Psaki said at the time it was believed Addison was being held as a witness to the crime, and that they are doing everything in their power to secure her release.

But since East Timor just gained independence in 2002, their justice system is still in development which has hindered the drug case, leaving Addison lonely, frightened and alone and in a strange country.

The case took yet another negative turn on October 28, when she was arrested again and put behind bars in a cell. 

She was incarcerated at Gleno Women's Prison where she shared a cell with several other prisoners, including a women who just gave birth to a baby, and cares for the child behind bars.

Addison, a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley and UC Davis was living in Portland, Oregon before she set off on the second half of her trip earlier this year.
