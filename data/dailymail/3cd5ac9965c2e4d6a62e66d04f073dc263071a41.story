An American soccer player who wasn't picked for the U.S. World Cup team is playing for his parents' native country Iran.

Steven Beitashour, who was born in San Jose, California, is the only American playing for the Iranians in Brazil this summer - a decision which has outraged some fans.

The 27-year-old player, whose current club is the Vancouver Whitecaps, is able to play for Iran because his parents were born in the Islamic state.Â 

He told the San Jose Mercury News: 'I'm not there to cause any problems. I'm not there for any flash. I'm there for the love of the game.'

He told the paper that he understands Farsi more than he speaks but hoped his decision would help improve U.S.-Iranian relations.

Despite his own neutrality, Beitashour's decision to play for Iran has drawn strong criticism.

One fan accused him of 'selling his soul' for the chance to play at the World Cup, according to the New York Times, while another Bob Bagheri tweeted: 'You are a disgrace to America. Shame on u. I was born in Iran and left in 1979, and would never play for Iran.'

Despite reports today that the U.S. 
and Iran could join forces for a military operation over 
deteriorating security conditions in Iraq, the two countries have a 
hostile history. In 
1979, a diplomatic crisis was sparked after 66 Americans were held 
hostage in the country for 444 days. More recently, Iran has been 
subjected to heavy U.S. sanctions over its nuclear program.

Beitashour's parents, Edward and Pari, immigrated from Iran to the U.S. in the 1960s.

Soccer players qualify to play for other countries if they have a parent or grandparent from that country. U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann has selected seven foreigners for Team USA

Although Beitashour attended U.S. national team training camps in August 2012 and the 
following January, he never got into a game.

In October 2013, Beitashour made the decision to join Iran who face Argentina, Nigeria and 
Bosnia and Herzegovina in Group F at this year's World Cup.

The player did not start for Iran in today's match against Nigeria. Iran has a 2,000-1 shot to win the World Cup.

Beitashour started his career at the San Diego State Aztecs, going on to 
play professionally for the San Jose Frogs and San Jose Earthquakes 
before ending up in Vancouver.

Although he is the only American on the pitch for Iran, he is not the only American on the Iranian team. Portugese-American Dan Gaspar from Connecticut has been Iran's goalkeeper coach for three years.

Mr Gaspar told the AP: 'I believe they find me more interesting. In three-plus years working in Iran, I have never have had any issues as a result of my nationality, Portuguese-American. I have been impressed by the Iranian hospitality and kindness.'

Some Americans were unhappy with Beitashour's decision to play for the Iranian team in this year's World Cup
