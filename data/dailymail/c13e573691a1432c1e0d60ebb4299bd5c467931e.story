A tranquil village was over-run by hundreds of youths who turned a charity barn dance into a massive rave.

Teenagers descended on the farmyard after posting information about the fundraiser, which had been partly-organised by the farmer's son, on Facebook and Twitter.

Officers were forced to set up road blocks around the picturesque village of Sherfield English, Hampshire, as drunken revellers turned up 'in droves'.

Paramedics tended to ravers who got so drunk they passed out, needing immediate medical attention.

A 17-year-old boy and another young woman were rushed to hospital suffering from the effects of alcohol.

Dozens of police raced to the farm, near Romsey, after locals flooded the 999 control room with calls complaining about the noise.

Officers arrived at 11.15pm on Saturday - and finally shut down the event five hours later, at 4am on Sunday.

Residents reported that bottles were left strewn all down a country lane leading to a marquee next to the barn where the event took place.

Some were even dumped in a water trough used by horses.

The landowner today said the event had started out as a charity barn dance but got out of hand when hundreds of youths turned up.

Landowner Clive Jones said: ''All of the neighbours were warned beforehand.

'It got out on the internet that it was a rave and it got out of hand.'

His son Gus said today he said he never intended for so many to people to attend.

Gus, 34, a farmer, said: 'I sent out a private message to about 250 people on Facebook about the party, which was invite-only.

Gus Jones, one of the organizers of the party, and also son of Clive Jones, said he never intended for so many to attend the fundraiser

'Much more people ended up arriving than I thought would.

'I think it was because people were tweeting and writing on Facebook about the party, so more started to come.

'It was a very honest and innocent thing I was trying to do.

'The event was to raise money to help build a local children's playground.

'From people making donations at the party we managed to raise £500, which I was really pleased with.

'I never felt it was out of hand until it got shut down - but it was always going to end at 2am.'

A spokesman for West Dean Playground Committee denied any knowledge of the party.

Police
confirmed word of the event appeared to have gone viral on the 
internet, with college students travelling from all over the county to 
attend.

A Hampshire 
Constabulary spokeswoman said calls started to come in just after 
10.45pm on Saturday, and they arrived within half an hour.

They found people still making their way to the site and called for backup as they began turning youngsters away.

As the situation developed, officers ordered the music be turned off and started to disperse the crowds.

Parents soon began to arrive to pick-up their children, with one dad allegedly refusing to obey a police cordon.

He was arrested and charged with obstructing a police officer in the course of their duty.

Hampshire Constabulary spokeswoman 
Susan Rolling said: 'Officers attended an unlicensed music event just 
after 11pm on Saturday after complaints from those living in the area.

'On arrival at the scene, they discovered more than 300 people present and more still trying to attend.

'The event itself was being held in a barn on the site.

'Many of those attending the event were heavily intoxicated, and several received medical treatment.

'Officers took steps to locate the organisers of the event, who were informed that the gathering was illegal.

'Action was then taken to disband the crowd, and the site was cleared at shortly after 4am.'

Chief inspector Andy Houghton, police commander for the area, warned the force would take a 'robust stance' on any unlicensed music event.

He added: 'These type of illegal gatherings cause disruption and distress to local communities and anyone organising or attending such an event runs the risk of gaining a criminal record.

'Those who organise them can be prosecuted and end up with a fine of up to 20,000 pounds, and even six months in jail.'

A spokesman for South Central Ambulance Service said: 'If vital resources are diverted to cope with people who choose to drink irresponsibly they are not available to respond to others suffering genuinely life-threatening medical injury or illness.

'We would urge people to consider their actions. It costs 247 pounds every time we send a resource out.

'We ask people to access the service appropriately and be mindful it is their money we are spending.'

Police continue to investigate.
