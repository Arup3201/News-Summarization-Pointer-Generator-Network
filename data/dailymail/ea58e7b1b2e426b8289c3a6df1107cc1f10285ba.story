A mother who became pregnant after months of gruelling cancer treatment suffered further heartache when her baby son was diagnosed with meningitis.

Nikki Anderson, 28, had feared she would never have another child after suffering a rare cancer of the adrenal gland.

But to her total surprise, she discovered she was pregnant after months of gruelling surgery and chemotherapy - only for baby Cody to be diagnosed with meningitis when he was just three weeks old.

Nikki Anderson, 28, had feared she would never have another child after suffering a rare cancer of the adrenal gland. But shortly after finishing gruelling chemotherapy, she discovered she was expecting baby Cody

Doctors discovered the tennis-ball sized tumour on top 
of Mrs Anderson's kidney in August 2011 when looking for a cause for her
continual weight gain.

The tumour was causing her to overproduce testosterone - making her pile on the pounds - and stopping her from getting pregnant.

It
was removed a month later, and she endured three months of daily 
chemotherapy before doctors found a second tumour, removed in May.

Shortly after that, and to her total surprise, she discovered she was expecting.

Mrs Anderson, from Bristol, said: 'I really thought that my body was just ruined by all I had been through.

'I
had to have fertility treatment before for my daughter, so with all the
chemo, operations, and scarring on top of that, I thought I would never
get pregnant - not in a million years.

Baby Cody arrived on September 14, weighing a healthy 6lb 1oz. But just three weeks later, he was rushed to hospital with a high temperature and diagnosed with meningitis

'When I found out it was a big shock - you forget all the cancer.

'I do believe things happen for a reason and that really this was meant to be.'

Baby Cody arrived on September 14, weighing a healthy 6lb 1oz.

But just three weeks after he was born, he was rushed to hospital with a high temperature.

Doctors warned Mrs Anderson and her husband Steve, 28, that Cody most likely had potentially fatal meningitis - which was later confirmed by a lumbar puncture.

Mrs Anderson said: 'It was petrifying. When they first did all the tests I didn’t want to believe what was happening to my baby.

Mother and son are both well again, although Mrs Anderson must have regular check-ups

'We were sleeping at the hospital for four nights and I would rather have taken his place.

'They were telling us to prepare for things like brain damage.

He was so tiny and wired up. Luckily it was viral, so he could fight it on his own and pulled through and he’s fine now, gaining weight and really healthy.'

Mrs Anderson is now cancer free, but has to return to hospital every three months for check ups.

She added: 'It is just all about waiting but for now I’m looking forward to a different Christmas with Cody and the rest of the family.'
