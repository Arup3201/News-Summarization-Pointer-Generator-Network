Frankie Dettori could still ride for boss Sheik Joaan Al Thani in next month’s Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe but it will need circumstances to fall into place.

The shock news that the 43-year-old had been replaced on favourite and 2013 winner Treve by veteran Thierry Jarnet at the request of trainer Criquette Head-Maarek emerged on Monday.

Dettori’s hopes of winning a fourth Arc and a first for his Qatari boss now could lie with Aidan O’Brien’s 2013 Derby winner Ruler of the World and Elie Lellouche’s Ectot but neither are his automatic rides.

Blow: Frankie Dettori lost the mount of Treve ahead of Group One Prix Vermeille at Longchamp on Sunday

Ruler Of The World was bought into on the understanding that Joseph O’Brien, son of trainer Aidan O’Brien, would keep the ride, while Ectot will remain the mount of his regular French rider Gregory Benoit for the remainder of the season should he want it.

But there is hope for Dettori. O’Brien would undoubtedly choose Australia should the dual Derby winner, who faces 12 rivals in Saturday’s Irish Champion Stakes, make it to the Arc.

While Benoit has a very attractive Arc alternative in unbeaten French Oaks winner Avenir Certain.

Success: Frankie Dettori celebrates winning The Prix Vermeille riding Treve at Longchamp last September

Benoit rides Ectot in Sunday’s Prix Niel at Longchamp but, with O’Brien on duty in Ireland, significantly, Dettori, will now ride Ruler Of The World in the Prix Foy.

He had been expected at the Curragh to partner Richard Hannon’s Osaila in the Moyglare Stud Stakes

The switch seems designed to demonstrate the Sheik’s backing for Dettori, whose position as his first jockey has been seriously undermined.

On an Arc ride for Dettori, Harry Herbert, racing manager to Sheik Joaan, said: ‘There are lots of balls in the air.’

Dettori’s mood will not have lifted by the disappointing defeat of the Sheik’s record £5.25million filly Al Naamah in the Prix d’Amaule at Chantilly, especially as her 25-1 pacemaker Shahah won.
