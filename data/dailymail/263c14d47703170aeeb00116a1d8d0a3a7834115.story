Doctors were last night battling to save a British skydiver's leg after a horrific accident in Fiji.

Ben Cornick, 31, attempted a 12,000ft jump from a plane over the South Pacific island on Tuesday.

But the father-of-one lost control of his parachute's steering toggle and crash-landed - colliding with a parked van at a speed of about 40mph.

Mr Cornick, whose son Alfie was born just a month ago, broke both his leg in three places and snapped his arm in half and was transported to hospital in Fiji.

Doctors
 said they were unable to pin his limbs together with their resources 
and said he would need to be transported to Auckland, New Zealand, on an
 emergency flight at a minimum cost of £20,000.

The skydiver's cousin Ricky Davies started up a donations page on Facebook and within hours, the £20,000 goal was reached.

Mr Cornick arrived in hospital in the north island city at around 9am yesterday morning.

The skydiver was told by hospital staff in Fiji he would need £20,000 for a transfer to Auckland to have surgery

He was due to go in to surgery to save his leg yesterday evening.

Mr Davies, a skydiver himself, said:'While he was doing the swoop the toggle came out of his hand and he hadn't completed the turn.

'I spoke to Ben and he was a bit groggy from the drugs he is on but that's what I could make out. His right femur snapped in three places.

'His left arm between his shoulder and elbow is in half and he has got cuts and bruises and damaged his knee- cap.

Friends of the experienced skydiver raised the money in a matter of hours, and he was moved to New Zealand

'In Fiji, they have only got small hospitals. They had a look at him but couldn't pin and screw that together.'

Mr Davie added: 'His parents haven't got that sort of money, I haven't got that sort of money.

'I
 got on Facebook and spoke to a few skydivers to see if they had any 
contacts. I put up the page where we can all go.

'Now, we have saved his 
leg and possibly his life.'

Mr Cornick was due to have surgery last night. His family said before the procedure he was doing well

Mr Cornick's family are continuing to appeal for money as they are unsure whether he will need further medical care

Yesterday, the total raised for Ben through the Facebook page stood at £27,000.

Mr Davies told the Western Mail: 'The
 page was set up at about 9pm or 10pm on Wednesday. I think it was about
 16 hours from starting the Facebook page that we accomplished the 
£20,000.

'The guys in 
Auckland wouldn't transport Ben until they had the money up front. It is
 actually another, fellow skydiver who paid the £20,000 up front on my 
word that I would give him the money back.'

Mr Davies said they did not know what the cost of the operation or Ben's continued medical care would be, so the fundraising would carry on.
