Margaret Thatcher was not known as a gourmet - but she may have helped Britain become the culinary capital of Europe, according to a leading chef.

Michelin-starred restaurateur Michel Roux claims that his home country of France is falling behind the UK thanks to its use of pre-packaged ingredients and microwaved meals.

He blames the decline on EU regulations which limit the number of hours chefs can work - and credits Thatcher with stopping Britain going the same way.

Warning: Michel Roux says that France's culinary scene is in decline thanks to employment laws

Mr Roux, 73, moved to Britain nearly half a century ago, and along with his brother Albert set up two of the country's best restaurants, Le Gavroche in London and the Waterside Inn in Berkshire.

He is therefore well placed to compare the culinary tradition of France with that of the UK - and his firm opinion is that the French are set to lose their world domination.

A combination of French working time laws and European regulations mean that most workers in France are restricted to working 35 hours a week, which is a far cry from the exhausting hours traditionally worked by chefs.

According to Mr Roux, this means that French restaurants are forced to take shortcuts to get round the problem of shorter working hours.

Saviour: Mr Roux says that Margaret Thatcher's refusal to introduce legislation rescued British restaurants

'When the food comes in the morning, you have to unwrap it, clean it, store it, prepare it properly,' he told the Sunday Telegraph. 'In those hours, you can't do that.

'So restaurants are buying food which is either pre-cooked, vacuum-packed or frozen. Instead of having three or four chefs in a bistro, they have one who can open a baguette and put food in the microwave.'

He added: 'Chefs work long hours, some up to 50 hours in five days. Does it hurt them? Do they feel worse? They are proud of their job and what they're doing.

'In France, they've lost it. How can you be proud of doing your job reheating food out of packets?'

Achievement: Mr Roux founded the Waterside Inn, one of the best restaurants in the UK

Britain has repeatedly sought to opt out of EU employment legislation under leaders including Thatcher, John Major and David Cameron.

Asked whether he thought Thatcher was responsible for Britain's culinary rise, Mr Roux replied: 'My God, she saved the country!'

Although he still visits France every month, he told the Telegraph he now avoids bistros and brasseries because the average standard has fallen so far.

Despite Mr Roux's outburst, there are still far more restaurants in France which are considered world-class than there are in Britain.

Just four British restaurants - including the Waterside Inn - hold three Michelin stars, compared to 26 in France.
