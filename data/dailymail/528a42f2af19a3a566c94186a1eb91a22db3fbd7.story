Jailed sex attacker Max Clifford is trying to raise £12,000-a-month – by renting out his £6million mansion.

The seven-bedroom home, on a private estate in Hersham, Surrey, is available ‘immediately’ through a local estate agent – though any tenant would have to pay £144,000-a-year for the keys to the property.

The listing comes just days after the 71-year-old was divorced by his wife of four years, Jo, in a hearing which lasted less than two minutes at a London court.

Yours for £12,000-a-month: Disgraced former PR supremo Max Clifford, pictured outside his home before he was imprisoned, has put the mansion on the rental market

Clifford, 71, was given an eight-year jail term earlier this month at Southwark Crown Court after being convicted of a string of indecent assaults on four women between 1977 and 1984.

Estate Agents Grosvenor Billinghurst have described the ‘beautiful’ home, which features an outdoor swimming pool, as ‘ideal for entertaining with its ample five receptions’.

It has five bathrooms and seven bedrooms as well as accommodation for either staff or an au pair.

The public relations expert and wife Jo were granted a divorce by a judge sitting in the Central Family Court in London.

She split from him on the grounds of ‘unreasonable behaviour’ though neither was at the hearing which lasted just 105 seconds.

Three women who were assaulted by jailed Max Clifford have also revealed they are suing the disgraced PR guru, just a day after his wife divorced him.

The shamed PR guru’s fortune was estimated at £10million before the huge legal bills from his court case.

It has been reported that he took out a £3.5million loan on one of the properties he owns in the run-up to his trial.

Clifford also has a house in an exclusive golf development in the hills near Nuevo Andalucia, southern Spain, which he valued at £1.5million in 2008.

He has said he made £2.5million a year from his PR work. The latest accounts for his company, Max Clifford Associates, in 2012 show a turnover of around £3.5million and give the firm an estimated worth of £1.2million.

He has also boasted that he got a new Bentley - each worth £200,000 - every two years.

However, his legal bills are thought to amount to more than £250,000 and it has been claimed that he has written to previous clients asking for their financial help to meet these costs.
