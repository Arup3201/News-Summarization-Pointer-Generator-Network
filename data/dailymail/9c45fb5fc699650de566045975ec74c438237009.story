An underground Hobbit motel inspired by JRR Tolkien is just one of the unique places to stay at the world's most unusual hotel complex.

But if subterranean sleeping doesn't sound appealing, guests can rest their head in a train, plane or boat at the themed Woodlyn Park estate in Waitomo, New Zealand.

The 3.5 hectare estate is home to a variety of unusual lodging experiences for visitors, including a range of historic transport units which have been decked out and turned into self-catering accommodation.

Bag end: The hobbit hole is inspired by the home of Bilbo and Frodo Baggins from the Lord of the Rings tales

True to fiction: The suite, designed around the description from Tolkein's books, is one of four rooms available in the New Zealand complex

Star attraction: The Hobbit hole was built two years after the release of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films

The World's first hobbit motel, with its circular windows and doors, was built two years after the final Lord of the Rings film was released and attracts score of visitors.

The self-contained rooms come with kitchens, shower and toilet facilities and can accommodate between two to 10 people.

Woodlyn Park also offers visitors the chance to stay in a 1950's train and Bristol Freighter plane, which was one of the last allied planes out of Vietnam, and a WWII patrol boat.

Park owner Barry Woods said: 'My park 
contains four different and unusual places to stay, that you would never
get to experience in normal everyday life.

'I wanted to go into tourism, but it had to be something different.

'I saw an advertisement online for an old decked out train, and straight away I just knew that was what I had been looking for.'

Upgrade: Guests can also stay in a Bristol Freighter plane, which was an aircraft used during the Vietnam conflict by American armed forces

Grounded: The plane has been converted into a two-room unit and is the only one of its kind

Room with a view: One of the bedrooms inside the plane allows guests to sleep in a cockpit

The fully refurbished plane comprises two self-contained motel units and is the only accommodation of its type in the world, while the "The Waitomo Express" is a 1918 Rail Carriage restored into a completely self-contained motel unit with two separate bedrooms.

It sleeps up to six people and comes with a double bed and two sets of single bunks.

Barry explained: 'It was important for me that I carried on with the theme, and that it wasn't just a one hit wonder.

'My next idea was for the plane motel, which was difficult as I knew I had to get the right one.

'As they're not very big inside, it proved more difficult than I'd hoped, until I eventually tracked this one down in Australia that I knew would be perfect.

All aboard: The 112ft 'Waitanic' is another of park owner Barry Woods' imaginatively themed rooms

Big ideas: The boat which is inspired by the Titanic, Mr Wood, pictured right, said it took two years to complete

The 112ft boat, called The Waitanic, took Barry two years to complete.

'It boasts five rooms as is one of only 12 of its kind left.

'People are always so excited when they visit the motels', Barry said.

'People who have an interest in trains, boats and planes come here simply because of their love of the vehicles.

'Because the motels here have a historical aspect to them, it has become an almost tourist attraction.'
