UEFA could face serious questioning after a number of CSKA Moscow fans appeared inside the Arena Khimki during their Champions League clash against Manchester City.

UEFA had banned the sale of tickets and ordered the Group E match to be played behind closed doors as punishment for the racist behaviour of CSKA fans.

But at least 200 supporters were seen in front of the press box during Tuesday evening's match.

UEFA had ordered the match to be played behind closed doors because of racist behaviour by CSKA fans

But more than 200 CSKA supporters managed to get in to the ground and sat in front of the press box

Official crowd - 0

Club delegates - 75 per club

Centre circle boys and parents - 50

Media - 150

UEFA partners (sponsors) - 300 

The fans were spotted drinking alcohol and chanting during the game which saw City draw 2-2 after Seydou Doumbia's close-range finish and Natcho's late penalty cancelled out first-half goals from Sergio Aguero and James Milner.

It is claimed that the fans could have obtained the match tickets through sponsors who had been allocated tickets for the game.

Manchester City fans were not allocated tickets for the game under the UEFA punishment.

The Etihad club have not indicated whether they will complain over the apparent breach of rules.

CSKA media director Sergey Aksenov insisted the club had nothing to do with the fans who entered.

He said: 'Those people you are talking about are 360 people from the UEFA Champions Club - partners, sponsors. If they are CSKA fans, they are good for us. Everyone is invited by UEFA, not CSKA.'

In a strange post-match press conference, CSKA coach Leonid Slutsky was also asked about the situation - but the question drew laughter from Russian journalists.

'I don't know,' he said, to applause.

Captain Vincent Kompany was not so worried to speak his mind and criticised organisers for not allowing City supporters into the stadium, saying that they were being punished for the actions of others.

'It's supposed to be a game without fans but yet there are still 500 fans cheering on for them, which is not a problem, but I don't understand where our fans are,' he told Sky Sports News. 'Why can we not bring our fans?

Kompany said his team were at a disadvantage because they had no fans cheering them on in Russia

'I feel like the only team being punished today was Man City.

'Probably pundits and the people writing the column will say well, you know, we should be looking at what our team did, so we'll do that and we'll improve, but (there are) little things where I think sometimes we need to speak up. I mean, it's nonsense.

'They're the team that got done for racism, not Man City. Why can't our fans come?

'It doesn't affect us, but fair is fair and maybe now is the time to say it and now is the time to speak up.' 

City's visit to the Khimki Arena in the same competition last year was also overshadowed by controversy as midfielder Yaya Toure was racially abused by CSKA fans.

That was the first of three offences in the space of a year which culminated in the current three-match stadium closure.

In this latest clash, CSKA claimed a draw after being awarded a controversial penalty four minutes from time.

Despite Milner and Aguero's efforts, the game ended 2-2 meaning City have failed to win in Europe this season

In was suggested to City boss Manuel Pellegrini that the presence of supporters may have encouraged the hosts or even influenced the referee's decision.

Pellegrini said: 'Well I agree but maybe it is not my duty to talk about things that do not correspond to my duty.

'I think UEFA has its rules. This stadium was closed doors to everyone.

'I don't know who has permission to give entrance to all those peoples, but really it is not my duty. I don't want to talk about the referee or other things. I don't want to be punished again.'
