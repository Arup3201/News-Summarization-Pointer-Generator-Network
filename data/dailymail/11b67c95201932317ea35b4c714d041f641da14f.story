Indiana man Kenneth Harden was charged with nearly 40 felonies last year but will only serve two years in jail after his wife changed her statement 

An Indiana man charged with almost 40 felonies last year will only serve two years behind bars after his wife changed her statement to police.

Kenneth Harden, 32, was charged with 38 crimes including rape, intimidation, strangulation criminal confinement and domestic battery after he allegedly abused his wife at their Seymour home. 

According to court documents, Harden made his wife sign a sex-slave contract and mark the document with her own blood. 

Harden's wife was forced to wear a collar and perform sex acts on a daily basis. 

There were also times he burned her with cigarettes, choked her until she was unconscious and locked her head in a box, the wife said.

A search of their home revealed an 11--page document called 'Sex Slave Manual 2014' that outlined the woman's role, chores and punishments.  

The 'slave' told police she couldn't leave her 'master' because he controlled the medication she needed for her severe diabetes. 

After initially detailing her treatment to police following an incident on August 30, 2014, Harden's wife changed her statement.

Before she changed her mind, the wife  said: 'I'm tired of the abuse.

'I'm tired of getting hit every day. 

'Please, I'm scared.'

Prosecutors felt their case against Harden had weakened substantially so they offered him a negotiated plea deal, the Indy Star reported. 

Some of the offenses Harden was charged with were each punishable by up to 20 years in prison. 

He will only serve two years in prison and be on probation for one after pleading guilty to one charge of criminal confinement. 

Jackson County Prosecutor AmyMarie Travis said the wife, who has not been identified, 'believes justice has been served'.

Travis said: 'The victim's deposition was not consistent with her original police report.

'It became clear to the state of Indiana that it was proper to offer a negotiated plea agreement that we offered.'

Harden and his wife met on Craiglist. 

He has been in jail since he was arrested. 

A change-of-plea hearing on the matter is scheduled for March 6 in Jackson Circuit Court.
