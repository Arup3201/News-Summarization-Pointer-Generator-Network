A ten-year-old schoolboy racked up a £600 bill in three hours by playing an iPhone game downloaded for free.

Lee Walters from Streetly in the West Midlands downloaded the 'Hay Day' app on his mother's old iPhone - and paid £19 a time to buy virtual diamonds and gold coins.

He innocently clicked on the 'buy now' option which appeared more than 12 times an hour - landing his mother Katharyne, 42, with a giant £613 bill.

Theory: Katharyne Williams (pictured with Lee) believes he was able to cost her the huge sum because the phone kept a password saved

Ms Walters, who runs a fireplace business, was in control of her son's Apple password but believes he was able to pay because the phone kept it saved.

Today she warned parents to monitor their children's usage of iPhone apps to ensure they are not unwittingly racking up monster bills.

'I'm not a stupid person but this has made me feel really stupid. I'm devastated,' she said.

'It's a child's game that attracts children. It could happen to so many people.

'These people are designing these but I wouldn't allow children to have anything like that if they can spend money on it.

Problems: Lee Walters, 10, managed to rack up a £600 bill on a game that was downloaded for free on an Apple iPhone

Upsetting: Even though the Apple App 'Hay Day' is a free download, it does contain options for people to pay for extras

'As soon as I saw the emails coming through on the Sunday I cancelled my card and got in touch with Apple.

The one saving grace for Lee (right) is that he is not the first youngster to amass a huge amount of money on his parents' computer.

The problem is of increasing concern and it emerged earlier this year that Apple is to pay £66million in compensation to parents in America whose children run up massive bills using its free apps.

Now as many as 23million people are eligible for a refund.

However, the decision is unlikely to affect British families.

A US legal case was triggered by a nine-year-old girl from Pennsylvania who bought $200 (£132) of 'virtual money' from three free Apple games.

In a lawsuit brought by her father, the games were described as 'highly addictive' and designed to 'compel' children to buy game currency.

Under the terms of the case settlement, Apple has now agreed to offer refunds worth a total of $100million (£66million).

Experts say parents shouldn't  let children play with their phone if there are apps that can purchase automatically without inputting a passcode or security check.

If they do want to let children use their phone, they must make sure they disable the purchase information - this can usually be found in the phone settings, and will mean anyone has to input a password to make a purchase.

Putting your phone on 'airplane' mode - even if you’re not in the air - also disables all downloading and in-app purchases.

'What they don't tell you is if you download a free app, your phone holds the password for 15 minutes.

'We looked at the app and it's all bright colours and has GBP and the amount of money rather than a pound sign.

'He didn't realise he was spending money but if there would have been a pound sign then he would have done.'

The game 'Hay Day' is a new farming experience app where children are encouraged to harvest crops, build bakeries and rear animals.

It is free to play but the iTunes store warns that some game items can be purchased for real money.

Katharyne, who lives with her partner Paul Lammond, 49, son Lee and two daughters, aged 16 and 18, added: 'Lee had only had the phone for six months and has never done anything like that before.

'He plays other games and he always knew to ask and I drilled it into him that he could only have free apps.

'In his innocent little head he was playing a game that wasn't costing anything. He didn't

'I just want to warn other parents how easily something like this can happen.'

Apple have now refunded Katharyne the money and reminded parents to use the restrictions on the game to stop unwanted purchases.

A spokesman for Apple said: 'All iOS devices (iPad, iPhone and iPod touch) have built in parental controls that give parents and guardians the ability to restrict access to content.

'Our parents' guide to iTunes details the steps and measures parents and guardians can take to make sure younger players have access to the right content.

'The first thing we recommend is not to share your password.'
