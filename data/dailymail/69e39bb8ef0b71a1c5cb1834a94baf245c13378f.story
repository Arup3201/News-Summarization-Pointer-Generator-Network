When Prem Singh was asked to lend a helping hand frying fish at his family restaurant he took it rather too literally.

The chef, 65, has become famed in the backstreets of Old Delhi for his unique ability to plunge his bare hands into searing cooking oil.

He regularly dips his fingers into a bubbling vat of oil, which is heated up to 200C, to pluck out the fried fish.

They sold just fried fish, but over the years, Singh has moved to cooking other Indian delicacies too.

Singh
 says he sells over a hundred kilograms of fried fish each day, thanks 
to the demand to see him hand fry them.

He also serves other popular 
Indian delicacies such as tandoori chicken, mutton tikkas and kebabs.

With the business thriving, Singh's two sons are now chipping in and taking care of the business.

'We are hoping to expand now, and take the rich history further.'

And Singh now hopes his sons will keep up the eateries tradition of the hand fryer.

He added: 'They can do it too. It is just about practice. If they keep trying and experimenting, they will get there.'
