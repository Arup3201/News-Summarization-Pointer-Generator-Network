Southampton fans may feel their club is being stripped and sold for parts, but it isn't all doom and gloom as they find themselves top of the pre-season table.

It's always debatable as to how much pre-season matters, but Saints supporters will take any positives they can after the sales of Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren and Co.

And Southampton chairman Ralph Kruegar has tried to calm the nerves at St Mary's by insisting 'every penny' of the sold stars will be made available to Ronald Koeman.

Morgan Schneiderlin is likely to follow his former team-mates to the St Mary's exit after trying to push his transfer to Tottenham Hotspur through with an outburst on Twitter, although Krueger insists otherwise.

The Southampton chief adds - amid unease from fans over the
 selling spree - that the £90.5m raked in will be spent on the club.

'Ronald
 Koeman wants to build something here at Southampton,' Krueger told TalkSport. 'Our 
summer activity is definitely not a fire sale, every penny of that will 
be up for reinvestment as transfer fees and wages.

'It is there right now as we speak for Ronald and (club executive director) Les Reed to put into play in the transfer market.

'We
 need to have a dressing room filled with players who want to be at 
Southampton, who understand the way we’re moving forward, how we’re 
building towards European football and how we can get there in a healthy
 way.'

Elsewhere, Manchester
 City are going about their pre-season business as expected, the 
champions having picked up maximum points from four games. Stoke, however, find themselves at the opposite end, with a dire points-per-game average of 0.3.

West
 Ham join them in the bottom two with no wins from four matches - hardly
 the entertainment demanded of manager Sam Allardyce by the Hammers board.

Optimistic? Southampton manager Ronald Koeman will have the funds brought in made available to him
