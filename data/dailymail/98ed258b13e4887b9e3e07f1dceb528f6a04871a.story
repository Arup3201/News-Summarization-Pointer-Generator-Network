This is the moment a family of swans was seen waddling into town on the eve of the World Cup - to pop into their local bookmakers.

The cob and pen led their six cygnets on a 500-yard trek from their home on a boating lake to a nearby Betfred.

Amazed regulars watched as the birds waddled up the door and started pecking on the glass - as if they were desperate to have a flutter on the competition before the opening game.

Before long they gave up and retraced their steps through the centre of Perranporth, Cornwall.

Local say the adult swans - nicknamed Lord and Lady Swan - are regularly seen waddling around the pretty seaside resort.

Their antics can cause headaches for local motorists because the family have a tendency to walk in the middle of the road rather than using the pavement.

Despite their sudden interest in the bookies, the swans' favourite haunt is Floral Fancies, where Lord Swan often tries to follow florist Sharon Grant inside.

Ms Grant, who took photos of their latest stroll, said: 'The swans were outside the betting shop at 7am banging on the door to get in.

'It looked like they wanted to go to place a bet on England - it was hilarious

'Unfortunately they didn't seem to realise that Betfred wasn't even open for another two hours.'

Chelsea Johnson, who took some more pictures, added: 'They're a real favourite with everyone in the village and the holidaymakers love them too.

'Lord Swan is quite vain. He is always getting distracted by the sight of his own reflection in cars and shop windows, puffing up his feathers and leaving Lady Swan and the kids to admire himself.'

Denise Udry, owner of nearby Duchy Holidays, said: "The swans are real characters around the village.

'Everyone looks forward to seeing them bring their cygnets round each year, even the holidaymakers who stay with us ask after them.

'They're a real feature of the village in spring.'

A Betfred spokesman said: 'They obviously ruffled a few feathers and must have wanted a bet on the World Cup.'
