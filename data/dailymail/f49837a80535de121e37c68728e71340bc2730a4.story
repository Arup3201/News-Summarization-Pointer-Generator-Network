Spectators looked on in horror as the two vessels collided at the end of a 120mph straight at the F2 World Powerboat Championships in Nottinghamshire.

The No 14 boat piloted by Swedish driver Jonas Andersson launched into the air and flipped 360 degrees before crashing back into the water.

Meanwhile the No 6 racer driven by fellow Swede Ola Petterssen barrel-rolled before landing upright.

It is believed that neither competitor suffered serious injury in the crash at the National Water Sports Centre at Holme Pierrepont, Nottinghamshire on Saturday.

Neither driver qualified for the main Grand Prix race yesterday.

Photographer Graham Jones, who captured the dramatic shots, said the boats suddenly 'took off'.

'They had just come down the straight and were about to turn around the bouys at the end of the circuit when they clipped each other,' he said.

Photographer Graham Jones, who captured the dramatic shots, said the boats suddenly 'took off' and seemed to disintegrate when they crashed

'They took off and kind of disintegrated as bits flew off of them.

'It happened right in front of the grandstand to the whole crowd drew a breath.

'Amazingly both drivers seemed to be ok. One of them got out and stood on his boat with his hand in the air to indicate he was alright.

'The rescue crews had a few problems getting the other guy out, but they both walked off their boats in the end.'
