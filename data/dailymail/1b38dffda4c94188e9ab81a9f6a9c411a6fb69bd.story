A railroad mechanic paralyzed in a deadly New York derailment says he forgives the man who was driving the train.

Samuel
 Rivera of Ossining, New York praised Metro-North Railroad on Wednesday as he announced a $100
 million lawsuit against it in his first public speech. He forgives 'overworked' driver William Rockefeller who fell asleep while driving.

Rivera
 spoke from a wheelchair at a rehabilitation center in suburban White 
Plains, north of New York City. He has no movement of his legs and very 
little in his arms.

Samuel Rivera of Ossining, N.Y., speaks with reporters on Wednesday about his injuries, forgiving the train driver, and suing Metro-North

'I 
constantly live with nerve pain in my arms and hands, muscle spasms that
 painfully twist and turn my spine, and bed sores that never seem to 
heal,' the struggling Metro-North employee, Samuel Rivera said.

Even
 though he thanked his employer for not abandoning him after his 
injuries on December 1, he said his suit against Metro-North is to 
'protect his family's financial future.'

'My care will costs hundreds of thousands of dollars each year,' Rivera said.

Four
 people were killed and more than 70 injured in the Dec. 1 derailment in
 the Bronx. Investigators say the train was going 82 mph as it hit a 
curve with a 30-mph speed limit. The driver, William Rockefeller, fell asleep at the wheel.

Rivera is calling for legislation mandating seat belts on public transportation.

Rivera believes that seat belts could have saved four of the lives lost in the derailment, reports The New York Post.

'I
 must say you don’t realize what you have until it’s gone; simple things
 like walking and hugging your kids,' he said in the remarks.

Rivera's case happens to be the seventh case against Metro North surrounding the same incident.

A railroad spokesman said on Wednesday that he could not comment because the lawsuit is pending.

The driver of the train, William Rockefeller, who has been suspended without pay since the crash, worked an average of 762 overtime hours per year in 2010, 2011 and 2012, according to MTA data.

On the basis that Metro-North drivers work a typical 40-hour work week of five eight-hour shifts, that's the equivalent of working a sixth day every week for three years straight.
