A four-year-old boy has been crushed to death by a horse as his mother watched in horror.

Matthew Young was at the farm of his showjumper uncle waiting to ride the horse when it stumbled at a fence and fell on to him in front of his mother, Margaret.

He had been standing near the fence at the home of Alex Barr, 29, one of Britain’s top showjumpers.

Tragedy: The boy was crushed to death by a horse on a farm near Lesmahagow, South Lanarkshire (pictured)

He was taken by ambulance from 
Kypehall stud farm near Lesmahagow, Lanarkshire, to Winshaw General 
Hospital, 15 miles away, where he died from his injuries.

One shocked local told The Scottish Sun: 'Matthew's mum was there when it happened, so it must have been horrifying for her.

'They're a lovely family, and all love horses, so it's particularly difficult that he was killed by one.'

It is not known if Matthew’s father, John, 41, also witnessed the accident on Thursday afternoon.

The couple are believed to also have a ten-year-old son and daughter aged seven.

This morning, Graeme Riddell, chairman of Lesmahagow community council, paid tribute to the boy.

He said: 'It's just so tragic. My condolences are with the family at this terrible time.

'We're quite a spread out community here, but when the news does get around I am sure it will shock everyone.'

A Police Scotland spokesman said: 'A 
four-year-old boy has died following an incident involving a horse at 
his family's farm in Lesmahagow on Thursday, January 2.

Accident: The child was taken to Wishaw General Hospital on Thursday afternoon, but died shortly afterwards

'He was taken by ambulance to Wishaw General Hospital but died from his injuries a short time later.

'A postmortem examination will be held in due course to establish the exact cause of death.

'However, the death is not being treated as suspicious.'

Last night, the family were too distraught to comment.
