Liverpool new boy Lazar Markovic does not want the Reds to make up the numbers this season, and he is targeting Premier League and European success straight away.

The Serbian winger, who will wear the No 50 shirt this season, has only known success in his fledgling career so far, having lifted the league title in each of his four seasons in professional football - three with Partizan Belgrade and one with Benfica.

And the 20-year-old told Liverpool's official website that: 'With the Premier League and the Champions League, we'll be going for it on both fronts. There are a lot of reasons for optimism. This club is very ambitious.

Rapid: Lazar Markovic is known for his pace, and will look to expose opposition full backs this season 

Getting in shape: Markovic has only played 45 minutes for Liverpool so far, but is nearing full fitness

'The competition is fierce but I did not come to Anfield to fight for sixth or seventh place. 

'Liverpool and our fans deserve the return of the most important trophy. I would love to be a part of the generation that brings this trophy back to Liverpool.'

Back in the day: The Serb impressed at Benfica last season, and wants to bring that form to Anfield

Markovic has endured a frustrating time since joining the club in July for £20 million, as injuries have meant his participation has been restricted to just 45 minutes of action in a pre-season friendly against Olympiacos.

But the wide player is nearing a return to fitness, and is looking forward to the chance to impress manager Brendan Rodgers and the Liverpool faithful. 

Mentor: Markovic believes Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers can get the best out of him 

'I believe Liverpool fans expect a lot from me, and to be honest I expect a lot from myself,' he said.

'I do not have any fear or stage fright whatsoever. To tell you the truth, I can't wait to start playing for Liverpool.

Sole appearance: Markovic has only featured once for Liverpool so far, in a friendly against Olympiacos

Sterling service: Markovic wants to develop at Liverpool like Raheem Sterling has done in the past two years

'Mr Rodgers will help me to become even better, just like he did with other young players. We'll see where the coach will put me because I can play many positions and for every one of them there is great competition. I will give it my all.'

Markovic also paid tribute to club captain Steven Gerrard, and said: 'He is a legend, an icon, the king of the club. Yet still he is completely natural and normal.' 

The Serb could be in contention for Liverpool's clash against champions Manchester City on Monday, where the Reds will look to build on their 2-1 win against Southampton on Sunday.

Captain fantastic: Markovic has spoken of his admiration for club captain  Steven Gerrard - calling him 'an icon'

Winners: Liverpool beat Southampton in their opening Premier League match, and face Manchester City next
