Sean Urda, 17, died after he lost control of his inner tube and smashed into a light pole

A 17-year-old who was killed  after smashing into a light pole on Long Island while sledding is the first fatality from the blizzard that struck the northeastern US on Monday.

Sean Urda and two other 17-year-olds were taking turns sliding an inner tube down Chester Court in Huntington, New York, Monday night when Urda crashed. 

He was rushed to a nearby hospital with critical injuries, but pronounced dead, Newsday reports.

The crash occurred about 10pm. 

Witnesses told police that Urda lost control of the tube and smashed into a light pole. 

Chester Court is a small suburban street with culs-de-sac at both ends. 

The north end of the street has a small hill. 

Urda is the first - and thus far this morning, only - death during the snow storm that caused much of the northeastern US to shut down Monday night and Tuesday morning.
