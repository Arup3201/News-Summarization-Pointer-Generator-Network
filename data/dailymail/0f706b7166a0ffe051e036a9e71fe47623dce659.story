Scene: Baures was working at a banquet on the second floor of WingDam Saloon and Grill when the accident happened on December 1

Mork said the cook, who was located in the kitchen, heard the food elevator begin to descend to his access point on the first floor.'

'He [didn't] hear vocalizations of any kind. When the cab landed on the first floor he walked up expecting to see dirty dishes and immediately recognized that a person was trapped inside.'

Fountain City Police say they believe Baures was the only person who could have pressed the control button on the second floor. 

The report notes that 'due to the absence of doors on the cab specifically, an operator must physically stay clear of the device as it ascends or descends to avoid injury.'

'It is our finding at this point that no crime occurred in this tragedy,' Mork also said.

Accident: Police said Tuesday that ''It is our finding at this point that no crime occurred in this tragedy' 

According to the autopsy results, Baures sustained fatal crushing injuries to her brainstem and cerebellum after the dumbwaiter passed through the second floor. 

Mork said 'FCPD believes that Brooke's head was almost located almost entirely inside the cab of the elevator canted slightly to her right as the cab descended. 

'When the roof of the cab passed the sill of the second floor access, Brooke sustained fatal crushing injuries to her brainstem and cerebellum,' the release said.

Anyone operating the dumbwaiter had only about five seconds before the interior of the cab disappeared below the sill, police said.

The dumbwaiter has since been permanently removed.

Federal and state regulators have launched separate investigations.  

Speaking previously to the Winona Daily News, Mr Mork added: 'To explain more of her specific location, orientation or obvious injuries would require an extremely graphic explanation.' 

Couple: In a harrowing 911 call, the co-worker said they had discovered Miss Baures's body after opening the elevator to shuttle drinks and food between floors. Above, the victim is seen with her boyfriend, Joel Hinke

In a harrowing 911 call, Miss Baures's unnamed co-worker told the dispatcher they had discovered her body after apparently opening the elevator to shuttle drinks and food between floors.

'I think one of my co-workers got (caught) in, like, our dumbwaiter,' the co-worker explained through tears. 'But I'm not willing to look close enough.'

The dispatcher then asked another employee at the Fountain City venue to look at Miss Baures's apparently contorted remains, according to the recording obtained by the newspaper.

The employee confirmed: 'It's her. We need someone here like ASAP.'

Miss Baures was twice named the Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference gymnast of the week this year and documented her athletics career enthusiastically on social media.

She was described by friends and family as a 'strong, determined, and beautiful young woman' at the candlelit vigil held on the University campus.

Miss Baures's teammates from Winona State University led the tributes to the gymnast, saying 'she was literally everything to the team.'

Brooke Hiestand, a member of Winona State Warriors, said: 'She was the person that held us together, and if you had something that you didn't know what to do...for some reason, she always knew the answer...always.'

Miss Baures's boyfriend Joel Hinke, who played for the Winona State Warriors football team, broke down as he spoke about how he had planned to marry her.

College officials also paid tribute to Miss Baures, who was an accomplished member of the gymnastics team from 2011 to 2014.

'She was a leader on the team and a talented gymnast,' said WSU athletic director Eric Schoh in a statement.

'This is a tremendous loss for our community, and we ask that you keep Brooke and her family, friends, coaches and teammates in your thoughts.'
