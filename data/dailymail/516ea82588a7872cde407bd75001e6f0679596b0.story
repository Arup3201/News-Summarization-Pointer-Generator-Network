Eliot Spitzer’s girlfriend Lis Smith has not been asked to take up a position in New York mayor Bill de Blasio’s new City Hall team in the wake of her affair with disgraced former governor.

Smith, 31, had been a key spokesperson during de Blasio’s campaign and transition until news of her relationship with ex-client Spitzer, 54, broke last month.

Once their affair became headline news, Smith was considered an unwelcome distraction by de Blasio’s team and she was effectively placed on leave.

Lis Smith, right, hasn't been offered a full-time post with new mayor Bill de Blasio's City Hall team after details emerged last month of her relationship with her ex-client disgraced former New York Gov Eliot Spitzer, right

Before they were know to be a couple, Smith had worked for as a spokeswoman during Spitzer's failed bid for New York comptroller in 2013

In the latter part of the transition and during the inauguration, Smith was said to be on vacation and she and Spitzer were spotted together visiting her parents on Christmas Day.

New Year’s Day was Smith’s last official day with the de Blasio team, reports Capital New York, although she didn’t work on the day the new mayor was being sworn into office. 

Smith had been contracted to work with de Blasio through his transition period and at one stage had been considered for a senior role within his permanent team - but those plans were sunk once her relationship became public knowledge.

She pretty much confirmed her departure on Thursday when she tweeted ‘I’m so proud to have worked on @Billdeblasio’s historic campaign and I’m looking forward to seeing what he does as mayor.’

Smith will now return to working as a consultant for the Democratic Governors Association and Maryland governor Martin O’Malley, both of whom remained clients while she was focused on de Blasio.

She will be based in both New York, where she has a SoHo apartment, and Washington D.C.

Smith hit the headlines last month after it emerged that she was in a relationship with ex-client Spitzer, whom she’d previously worked for as a spokeswoman during his failed bid for New York comptroller in 2013.

On Christmas Day Smith had taken Spitzer to meet her parents at a party at their home in the Westchester village of Bronxville.

Just the day before, Spitzer and his long-suffering wife Silda had announced the end of their marriage. An announcement triggered after photos had emerged of Spitzer leaving his lover's Soho apartment.

Senior de Blasio aides are currently interviewing candidates for a new communications director post. Smith had been considered a front runner but quickly fell from favor because de Blasio’s team were unhappy at being blindsided when news of her affair broke.

Since failing in his bid to become New York City Controller, Spitzer has decided to focus on his family's real estate business, just as he did when he lost office following the prostitution scandal in 2008.

Spitzer Enterprises just paid $88 million for a development site on Manhattan’s far West Side.

Smith joined de Blasio after 
Spitzer lost in the September primary and served as the 
spokeswoman for the Mayor-elect during his transition.

She
 was believed to have been the frontrunner to become de Blasio's press 
secretary, but that was before news of her relationship emerged.

In 2012, she led the 'rapid response team' on President Obama's reelection campaign.

Spitzer has been named as a possible 
presidential candidate before a federal investigation revealed him as 
'Client 9' of Emporer's Club VIP, which ran $1,000-an-hour call girls.

He and his wife Silda stayed married for five and a half years after the 
scandal that cratered his meteoric political career.

Silda Spitzer stood by her husband Eliot's side as he admitted to using high-class prostitutes and resigned in 2008. The couple announced their marriage is over on Christmas Eve

The couple have three grown daughters together: Elyssa, 23, Sarabeth, 20, and Jenna, 18.

It's
 unknown whether the timing of Silda and Eliot's split has anything to 
do with the his relationship with Smith going public.

A
 friend of the new couple told MailOnline: 'The relationship began long 
after Eliot and his wife were living separately and it was not a secret 
to any of their friends or family.

'It's sad to see lots of outright lies
 about Lis and her career - Lis is an incredibly smart and dynamic woman
 who is at the top of her profession and is universally respected.

'She's dealing with this well and is looking forward to getting on with her career and life.'
