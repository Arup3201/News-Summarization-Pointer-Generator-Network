Even before they took their seats for her show last night, mothers and their young daughters were left in no doubt about what Miley Cyrus had in store for them.

Dozens of explicit images displaying the controversial star’s body parts had been branded on to clothing, bags and underwear and displayed on merchandise stalls ready for the fans, some as young as six.

And once Miss Cyrus did appear on stage – via a long, pink slide designed to resemble her tongue – things only got more shocking.

Fresh off the boat: Miley Cyrus arrived at the O2 Arena in London by boat where she had promised to 'f*** this place up' during a show where all children under 15 had to be accompanied by a parent

It took only one minute for her to utter four swear words, and her foul language became increasingly appalling as the concert went on.

In her first London show on the European leg of her Bangerz tour, Miss Cyrus also simulated an orgy, talked about watching pornography, asked the audience of mostly young girls if they were ‘slutty’, urged the crowd to ‘make out’ with each other and joked about drinking, smoking and taking drugs.

During her rendition of her godmother Dolly Parton’s son Jolene, towards the end of her set, she shouted the C-word, before telling fans: ‘This is Europe, y’all can say c*** here.’

She also simulated an orgy on a bed with six male and female dancers, before asking the audience if they were as slutty as her American fans.

She then urged people to ‘make out’ with the person next to them, the ‘dirtier the better’, before projecting images of her young fans passionately kissing onto a giant screen. Later she spat bottled water onto the front row.

Not too worried: Hannah Cave, 37, from Yateley, Hampshire, took her eight-year-old daughter Ruby and said her daughter was too young to understand the sexualised imagery

Controversial from start: This merchandise stand featuring Miley Cyrus in a series of explicit photographs with parental advisory and censoring signs met parents and their young children when they arrived at the O2 arena for the show

Some parents said they had taken their children to the concert on a school night after giving in to pressure from them. Others justified subjecting their young daughters to lewd displays from Miss Cyrus by claiming ‘it’s nothing they haven’t seen before’.

The former Disney star performed her first London show on the European leg of her Bangerz tour at the O2 arena last night. The show has an age restriction with under-15s needing to be accompanied by an adult.

At a press conference earlier in the day, 21-year-old Miss Cyrus, who has undergone an extreme and raunchy makeover since her days playing wholesome teenager Hannah Montana for Disney, declared: ‘I’m gonna f*** this place up.

‘We’re gonna have a lot of fun. We’re gonna be, like, tops off, f*****g screaming.’

As they made their way inside the arena, many parents said they expected the show to be explicit but did not think it would harm their young children.

Hannah Cave, 37, from Yateley, Hampshire, took her eight-year-old daughter Ruby and said that although the show was ‘likely to be shocking’, her daughter was too young to understand the sexualised imagery.

She said: ‘To her licking a hammer is just licking a hammer. Plus a lot of these young girls loved Miley as Hannah Montana.

‘I think she thinks her transformation is a bit weird but sex and shocking stunts like Miley’s are all over the internet and news so children are much more unshockable now.’

Ego show: Miss Cyrus simulated an orgy, talked about watching pornography, asked the audience of mostly young girls if they were 'slutty', urged the crowd to 'make out' with each other and joked about drinking, smoking and taking drugs

They were warned: Miley has the phrase 'Parental Advisory Explicit Content' projected onto the stage

Party hard: There was no trace of Hannah Montana in her performance

Bad role model: Miley made several references to taking drugs, including saying her band was 'stoned' and asking the audience to take pills

Katie Thomas, 41, from High Barnet, north London, who brought her nine-year-old daughter Bay, said she felt ‘conflicted’.

‘I
 work in the entertainment industry so I understand what she’s doing 
somewhat. She’s young and pushing boundaries. But would I want my 
daughter acting like that and dressing like some of the fans here? 
Absolutely not.

‘Though I 
wouldn’t want my child to behave like Miley I don’t want my child to 
judge either and I don’t think it’s wrong for them to experience new and
 unusual things.

‘It develops their character and it’s not good to have too much censoring.’ 

John Hurst, 38, from Loughton, Essex, 
took his 11-year-old daughter. He said: ‘It’s not my cup of tea, but she
 wanted to come. It’s going to be a late night and it’s a shame, but 
she’s promised to be good in school.’

But
 Claire Dyer, 37, from Biggin Hill, said she had not wanted to bring her
 six-year-old Emily, but had eventually caved in to her daughter’s 
pleas.

She said: ‘I don’t think Miley is a very good role model. I don’t like the idea of them selling suggestive underwear either.

‘The
 show will probably be very shocking, I’ll probably have to cover 
Emily’s eyes. Some of the girls here are dressed very indecently. I 
would not want my daughter dressed like that at her age.’

She likes the high life: Miley wore Marijuana leaf shades with a gold chain to match

Injured: Miley said on stage hat she had sprained her foot during her stint in hospital

Last night parents looked furious as Miss Cyrus uttered four swear words in the first minute of her show.

She also joked to the audience of mostly young girls that they had been drinking, smoking and taking drugs.

Miss Cyrus was forced to postpone her US tour last month after a sinus infection and an unexplained bereavement.

Yesterday she said suggestions on the internet that she may have overdosed on drugs were lies.

She said: ‘When people are lying on the internet saying you’ve had an overdose, that makes you feel better.

‘I’m feeling good, I’m alive, so that’s f****** awesome. Look at me, I’m the poster child for good health.’

The daughter of country singer Billy Ray Cyrus, Miss Cyrus brought the word ‘twerking’ into the popular vocabulary last year when she performed a provocative set with pop star Robin Thicke at the MTV Music Awards.

It prompted a storm of complaints, but the pop star brushed them off, saying she was ‘representing women in a cool way’.
