It's a case that has left veteran police officers in Kentucky shocked and appalled.

A 24-year-old woman has been charged for allegedly trying to sell her newborn baby to two different people for $5,000 in order to cover fines and fees associated with felony drug charges.

Police in Elizabethtown were made aware of the crimes of Leeanna Brown after her cousin, Luonda Martin - who had custody of the baby girl at the center of the case - arrived at the Hardin County police station and reported Brown for attempting to take her daughter back.

Martin told police she was planning to adopt the baby - who has not been named - but that Brown had changed her mind and decided to give the little girl to someone else, according to The News-Enterprise.

Under arrest: Leeanna Brown, 24, was arrested Tuesday for attempting to sell her daughter after giving birth to her on Nov. 26. She was allegedly seeking $5000 to cover costs associated with a drug charge in July

The little girl at the center of the case, who has not been named, is believed to have been born on November 26. Police will allege in court that her mother, Leeanna Brown, attempted to sell her twice

Brown - who has previously been convicted of check fraud and shoplifting - was charged in July with nonpayment of fines and first degree possession of a controlled substance.

She gave birth on November 26.

Brown stands accused of trying to sell her baby to one woman for $5,000, however the deal fell through.

She then offered the child to her cousin, but only if Martin would cover her fines and court costs.

Brown also has two other daughters - a one-year-old and a two-year-old.

The arrest citation in the case shows the person to whom Brown tried to sell her baby also has temporary guardianship of the other two children.

Leeanna Brown, 24, tried to sell her baby twice, said police in Hardin County, Ky., to cover costs associated with drug charges laid against her in July

However police have since discovered the one-year-old has been in the care of another couple for at least seven months.

All three children were taken into emergency custody by Child Protective Services.

The people involved are also facing individual criminal charges, police said.

'It’s bizarre,' said Elizabethtown Police Officer Virgil Willoughby.

'You can’t just arbitrarily make a decision 'I’m going to give this child to person A, B, or C' and take money in exchange for that.

'No. You can’t do that.'

Interrogation: Leeanna Brown, 24, is interviewed by Hardin County police this week following her arrest for child endangerment on Tuesday
