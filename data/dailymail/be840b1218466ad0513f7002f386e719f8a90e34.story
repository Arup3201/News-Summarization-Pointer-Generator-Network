Owner Julie Evans has started a Facebook campaign to reunite the 'best friends' - with 10,000 online detectives trying to work out where Hansum has gone.

Ms Evans, 43, said: 'We were out walking Harry, Hansum and me. I let the dogs off the lead. Harry came back but Hansum did not.

'I knew something was wrong because Harry and Hansum were brothers from the same litter, totally devoted to each other.

Ms Evans, 43, said she was out walking when she let the dogs off the lead. Harry came back but Hansum did not

Ms Evans launched the Find Hansum Facebook page following his disappearance in May - it has gained thousands of followers, shares and likes

Ms Evans is offering a financial reward to anyone who can reunite the dogs

'I looked everywhere but there was no sign of Hansum. Harry now pines, for him, waiting by the gate to see if he'll come back. But day after day he doesn't.'

Ms Evans fears Hansum might have been stolen as they walked close to her home. 

She launched the Find Hansum Facebook page following his disappearance in May - it has gained thousands of followers, shares and likes.

The mother-of-one is even offering a financial reward to anyone who can reunite the dogs.

She added: 'I'd love if it somebody who hears about Hansum could let me know where he is.

'In my heart I believe he's alive and I just hope he's being treated well. It's possible he's been stolen or maybe taken in by someone who doesn't know he's being missed.'
