John Robert Reeves, 25, had expressed his feelings on blogs since 2004

Memorial service held for brother and sister who were shot dead

A Navy pilot who killed himself and three others had been posting troubled messages online for years, saying he would 'unintentionally screw people over'.

John Robert Reeves, 25, reportedly committed suicide by shooting himself in the head after murdering three
 others with him - fellow Navy pilot David Reis, 25, his sister Karen 
Reis, 24, and Matthew Saturley, 31.

The four dead were found in Coronado, 
California, after authorities responded to a report of gunfire around 2am last Sunday.

Deeply troubled: John Robert Reeves allegedly killed three people in California before turning the gun on himself. He had been posting distressed messages online since 2004

Reeves had taken part in online discussion groups since 2004, according to 10News.com, posting comments such as: 'I might come across as a nice guy, but I unintentionally screw people over on a regular basis.'

The
 motive for the shooting has not been revealed but authorities suggested
 it could have been motivated by jealousy. Results from an autopsy were 
not yet available to see if drugs or alcohol might have been involved.

Speaking about Reeves, clinical psychologist Dr. Michael Mantell told the station: 'There is a man who is hurting, who is in emotional turmoil. There's a storm brewing in him.'

Hundreds of people gathered at a ceremony on Friday to remember the brother and sister who were killed. David Reis was remembered by friends, family and others at a high school as an avid hiker and Navy pilot with a promising career, according to The  Bakersfield Californian newspaper.

Karen Reis was said to be a great role model and volleyball coach who hoped to become an occupational therapist.

At the end of the service, hundreds of coloured balloons were released into the sky.

Confirmed dead: Tom Reis said on Monday that his son David, left, and daughter Karen, right, were confirmed as victims by the Navy

Reeves and David Reis were both 
training as F/A-18 fighter pilots assigned to the Marine Fighter Attack 
Training Squadron 101 of the Third Marine Aircraft Wing at nearby 
Miramar Air Station.

Officials
 say they do not know the motive for the killing, but are investigating 
the possibility that Reeves had romantic feelings for, or a relationship
 with, Ms Reis.

'We are looking into all aspects, including the possibility there was 
some type of relationship between Karen Reis and John Reeves but that 
has not been confirmed yet,' said sheriff's captain Duncan Fraser.

Mr Fraser cautioned that investigators might never determine the motive 
because there were no eyewitnesses to the shooting.

He said the suggestion that Reeves was jealous of the attention being paid to Ms Reis by Mr Saturley was only speculation.

Retired Naval pilot Steve Diamond said the case was shocking because it involved such high achievers.

Mr Diamond said: 'The
 first thing that most people think of even within the Navy community is
 how could such an enormously tragic thing happen involving people who 
are the cream of the crop, highly trained, highly educated, national 
assets basically.'

It
 takes years of training to get one's wings as a Navy pilot, and 
fighter-jet pilots are considered to be among the top in that group.

They
 undergo a battery of rigorous physical, psychological and background 
tests before finishing the highly competitive program.'

The siblings' father Tom Reis
 didn't know who else was at the condo in the seaside community where 
his son had been living.

'He just had his first F/A-18 flight,' Mr Reis 
said. 'Oh man, he loved it.'

David Reis held a mechanical 
engineering degree from the University of New Mexico.

Karen Reis 
graduated from the University of California, San Diego in 2009.

She
 
stayed in the area, coaching volleyball and working at a grocery store. 
'She has a really great spirit and knows how to make things fun,' Ms 
Bailey said.

A passer-by called police on his 
mobile phone after hearing shots being fired outside the San Diego Bay 
condo in Coronado, California, at 2.20am on Sunday morning.

The first officers arrived within 
four minutes and found a dead man in the doorway to the three-story 
condo and the bodies of two men and a woman inside in different parts of
 the structure.

'They checked and he had no 
obvious signs of life,’ Sheriff's Lieutenant Larry Nesbit said. ‘They 
tried to make contact with anyone else that might be inside the building
 and they got no response.’

A SWAT team sent in a robot to the first floor of the building before searching the second and third floors. The bodies of two men and a woman were discovered in different parts of the three-storey building

A SWAT team then sent in a robot 
to the first floor and later searched the second and third floors. The 
bodies of two men and a woman were discovered in different parts of the 
three-storey building.

It was not immediately clear how 
the four people died. However, authorities previously said they did not 
believe there were any outstanding suspects.

Asked if it was a murder-suicide, 
he said: 'I'll let it infer what it does. We're not going to say that. 
Although it's very early in the investigation, we don't believe there 
are any outstanding suspects.'

Close: The killings took place just a few blocks from the famous Hotel del Coronado (pictured), where it was long speculated that the Prince of Wales, later to become King Edward VIII, visited and met Spencer Simpson
