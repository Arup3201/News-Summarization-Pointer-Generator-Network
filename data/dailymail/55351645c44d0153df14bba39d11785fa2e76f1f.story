The prosecutor in the case involving the death of Eric Garner says he is 'very seriously considering' submitting his name for consideration to replace resigning New York City congressman Michael Grimm.

Grimm, a Republican, said on Monday that he would vacate his Staten Island congressional seat on Jan. 5 after pleading guilty last week to a felony charge for tax evasion. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo must now call a special election to be held within 70 to 80 days of his announcement.

Daniel Donovan, Staten Island's district attorney, indicated today that he is interested in representing the Republican Party in the contest to fill the state's 11th congressional district.

'Last night and this morning, with the announcement that a vacancy will exist, my phone has been ringing off the hook,' Donovan said in a statement, according to the New York Observer. 

'I am deeply flattered by the enthusiastic expressions of support I have received over the last 12 hours, and I am very seriously considering the race. I will make an announcement after the due deliberation such an important decision deserves.'

Donovan's previous experience in politics extends back to 2010 when he ran for state attorney general and lost to Democrat Eric Schneiderman.

He is best known, however, for prosecuting a police officer who put Staten Island resident Eric Garner in a choke hold, contributing to his death.

A grand jury's decision not to bring charges against the law enforcement officer earlier this month incited national protests and the 'I Can't Breathe' movement - Garner's now famous last words.

Donovan's failure to convince the jury to allow the district attorney's office to move forward with its case has angered the city's African-American population. However, blacks made up just under 10 percent of the borough's population as of the last census.

Previously a part of the 13th congressional district, Staten Island became part of New York's 11th district after changes to the House map in 2012 as a result of the decennial census. Still remaining in the 11th is the southern portion of Brooklyn.

The majority Staten Island seat is the only New York City congressional district that is represented by a Republican. Grimm has served as the Republican leaning area's liaison to the House of Representatives since 2011.

Despite a federal investigation into business practices he engaged in before he was elected to Congress that led to 20 separate charges for federal crimes, Grimm won reelection in November, beating his Democratic opponent by seven points.

The Republican lawmaker insisted on his innocence throughout the fall but admitted last Tuesday that he helped hide $1 million worth of wages and receipts from a Manhattan health foods restaurant he partially owns by preparing a fraudulent tax return.

Prosecutors are asking that he receive 24 to 30 months in prison while his lawyer has argued that 12 to 18 months would be more appropriate. 

Last week Grimm said he would remain in Congress. By Monday he had been convinced to step down, allegedly by House Speaker John Boehner, as he awaits a judge's verdict that will determine his legal fate.

New York Rep. Michael Grimm, a Republican, said on Monday that he would vacate his Staten Island congressional seat on Jan. 5 after pleading guilty last week to a felony charge for tax evasion. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo must now call a special election to be held within 70 to 80 days of his announcement

Among the interested Democrats are Staten Island Assemblyman Michael Cusick, left, and Grimm’s predecessor, former congressman Michael McMahon, right

Even before Grimm came clean about about his dirty business dealings, party leaders were considering possible replacements, should it come to that.

The day after Grimm was reelected, State Republican Party Chairman Ed Cox suggested that Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis could carry the GOP torch in a special election.

'She could be a wonderful candidate going forward, if Mike has problems going forward,' Cox said, per the Observer.

It is now up to Staten Island's Republican Party to choose a possible successor to Grimm, as state law only calls for a general election under the circumstances and no primary. 

Outside candidates could still compete in the contest but they would need to obtain 3,500 signatures in a relatively short amount of time in order to have their names printed on the ballot.

Potential GOP contenders for the party's nomination include Malliotakis, who told a Staten Island news publication on Monday evening that she was 'taking a serious look at the seat,' and State Senator Andrew Lanza, one of Grimm's competitors in the 2010 Republican primary.

Among the interested Democrats is Staten Island Assemblyman Michael Cusick. He said Monday, 'It's something I won't rule out and will give strong consideration to.'

Grimm’s predecessor, former congressman Michael McMahon, may also seek to reclaim his old seat. 

McMahon lost to Grimm four years ago by three points while in his first term in Congress. After Grimm's admission of guilt last week he told Roll Call he was neither 'ruling out or ruling in' a political comeback. 

'It will get serious consideration,' he said. 

Should McMahon represent his party in the special election, his vote for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, will likely be the subject of political attacks from his Republican opponent.
