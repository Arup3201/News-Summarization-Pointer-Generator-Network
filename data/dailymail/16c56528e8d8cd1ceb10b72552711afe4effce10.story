A father has hit out at a primary school after teachers allowed his four-year-old daughter to get in a cab with a complete stranger after class.

Malia Melon's family spent two hours searching for her after she was ushered into the private taxi which was waiting outside PS 78 in the Bronx, New York, for another child with a similar name: Melina.

Her father Fitzroy Melon was first told his little girl had got on a bus, then that she had walked home, before she was returned to the front gates, he claims.

'That could have been anybody. Any crazy person could just walk up and take someone. Thank God that's not the case.' he told NBC.

The family frantically searched the surrounding streets for Malia, while the other child Melina was left standing on the sidewalk.

It wasn't until the cab driver arrived at the home of the child he was supposed to pick up, that the school realised the mistake, according to CBS. 

The incident on Tuesday came after another parent claims their six-year-old was allowed to walk home alone.  

A spokesman for the school district said: 'This was the first day that the driver came to the school.

'When the driver picked up another student, the school contacted the driver, who brought the student back.

'The matter is being looked into, and the safety of our students is always top priority.'

Last week, a three-year-old girl in New Jersey was embroiled in a similar mix up after she was picked up from school by her classmate's grandmother.

Two staff members at the pre-K school signed off on the toddler’s release and sent her home with the woman, who reportedly kissed and hugged Madison, according to The Paterson Press.

It was not until the child arrived home that the mix-up became apparent and Madison Mills was promptly returned back to the school.

But according to Gemar Mills, his three-year-old, who suffers from a peanut allergy, could have died in the time it took the other family to bring the child back.
