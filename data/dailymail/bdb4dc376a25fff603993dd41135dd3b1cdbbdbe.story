NHS staff took away a four-year-old disabled boy's walking frame after hearing he and his family were moving house.

Oliver McConnell, who suffers from cerebral palsy, was left unable to get around after the health worker confiscated the frame.

Plucky Oliver is learning to walk after a pioneering operation in the US, paid for by community fundraisers.

But the walking frame was taken by an Oxford Health Trust worker who arrived at the McConnell’s home in Ambrosden, Oxfordshire, after hearing they planned to move to County Durham.

Oliver’s mother, Danielle, said: 'He had just started getting on his feet and the NHS just came and took his walking frame because we’re moving.

'It (the frame) was something so minor - how many crutches go missing? But for days I was thinking how is he going to get about or get to school.'

Yesterday, however, the trust did an about-turn, and returned the walking aid.

An Oxford health spokesman said: 'This should not have happened and we sincerely apologise to this family.

'A suitable frame has been delivered and they can retain it for as long as they need it. We will issue fresh guidance to staff to try to prevent this happening again.

'Staff have contacted the family to apologise in person and we wish them well with their move.'

Helped by a JustGiving page, Oliver¿s family raised thousands to take him for a pioneering operation in the USA two years ago

The family launched an appeal, Help Oliver Walk, in April 2012, to raise money for the life-changing operation.

Friends organised events including auctions, cake sales, sponsored runs and walks and a skydive.

Since his operation he has gone from strength to strength and the frame helps him walk around.

His mother had feared Oliver's progress and confidence would have been knocked if he did not have a frame.

So concerned were the family that Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineer colleagues of her soldier husband Barry, a Staff Sergeant at Bicester Garrison, were planning to make Oliver a temporary frame.

Oliver still has fortnightly physiotherapy and uses the frame to help him walk.
