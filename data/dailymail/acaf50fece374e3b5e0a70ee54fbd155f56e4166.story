Four workers have been killed and one injured during a hazardous chemical leak at a Texas industrial plant.

The chemical, methyl mercaptan, began leaking around 4am on Saturday morning in a unit at the DuPont plant in La Porte, about 20 miles east of Houston. Plant officials said the release was contained by 6am.

Several employees had responded to the leak when they were exposed to the chemical, plant manager Randall Clements said in a statement.

Tragic: Four workers have been killed and one injured following the leak of a hazardous chemical at a DuPont plant in La Porte, 20 miles east of Houston, Texas

Spread: Several employees had responded to the leak when they were exposed to the chemical. It could be smelt 40 miles away, but officials insist it was not a danger to the public 

'There are no words to fully express the loss we feel or the concern and sympathy we extend to the families of the employees and their co-workers,' Clements said. 'We are in close touch with them and providing them every measure of support and assistance at this time.'

A fifth worker was hospitalized and being held for observation. That worker's condition was not immediately known, and none of the victims was immediately identified.

According to ABC 13, one of them had been working at the plant for 40 years. 

Methyl mercaptan was used at the plant to create crop-protection products such as insecticides and fungicides, according to DuPont. The cause of the leak was not immediately known.

Clements said DuPont would be cooperating with local, state and federal officials investigating the leak.

'As part of that investigation, we are conducting our own top-to-bottom review of this incident and we will share what we learn with the relevant authorities,' he said.

Identities: The names of the victims were not released by police, however reports suggested one of the casualties had been working at the plant for around 40 years. The sign outside reads: 'Safety is a core value'

Aftermath: Plant manager Randall Clements said: 'There are no words to fully express the loss we feel or the concern and sympathy we extend to the families of the employees and their co-workers'

Jeff Suggs, emergency management coordinator for La Porte, said the chemical release was not toxic for those living nearby, but that it caused a smell that's similar to rotten eggs.

'It's a nuisance smell in the area. It's a smell that's traveled quite far,' Suggs said.

Methyl mercaptan is also commonly used to odorize natural gas — which has no odor — for safety purposes.

The La Porte plant has 320 DuPont employees. Four other companies are also tenants at the complex.
