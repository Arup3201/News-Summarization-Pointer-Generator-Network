The ex-wife of an Oklahoma oil magnate who was awarded the second biggest divorce settlement ever in the U.S. has finally cashed a personal check for $974.8 million.

Oil tycoon Harold Hamm credits the check with putting his divorce 'in the rear-view mirror'.  

Sue Ann Arnall had at first rejected the check, which Hamm said laid around for 'a week or so', and said the judge had grossly undervalued her stake in Hamm's vast oil fortune.  

She slammed the court's ruling as 'inappropriate' and 'not fair', believing her ex-husband is worth an estimated $18 billion.

Sue Ann Arnall (pictured during her divorce proceedings in September) has finally cashed a a personal check for $974.8 million from ex-husband Harold Hamm

No thanks: In an effort to end the divorce, Hamm penned this check to his ex-wife for $974.8 million, however she at first turned it down, claiming it was not a fair cut of his wealth

Pay up: Mr. Hamm and his ex-wife did not have a pre-nup, meaning she is entitled to half the assets earned during their marriage. Her lawyers claim he is worth about $18 billion

Hamm said the famous check got the job done, and now he's moving on.

But Arnall has other plans. 

Although Hamm's lawyers said that cashing the check nullifies Arnall's appeal, her attorneys will continue to pursue the case, according to NBC News.  

And Hamm's lawyers aren't going to stop either. Hamm filed his own appeal, claiming the amount was too high - and that he deserves some of that money back.   

Hamm founded Continental Resources in 1967 and Arnall was an executive at the company. 

The couple were married 26 years but never signed a prenuptial agreement.  

Hamm had already paid his former wife more than $20 million during the divorce proceedings. 

Arnall has taken ownership of the Oak Ridge Ranch in Carmel, California, a property purchased by the couple in 2011 for $14.7million, along with two of the couple's Oklahoma properties, as per the court's ruling.

Mr. Hamm will take their $750,000 home in Branson, Missouri and a $300,000 log cabin that sits on 154 acres in Major County, Oklahoma.  

Arnall made it clear she believed the marital wealth she was entitled to had been grossly undervalued.

The only spouse to ever score a bigger settlement in the United States was Jocelyn Wildenstein, who reportedly received $2.5billion after splitting with her businessman and art dealer husband Alec in 1999.

Real estate portfolio: Miss Arnall also picked up three properties in the divorce, including this home in Enid, Oklahoma

Relaxed living: The Enid home has been valued at $800,000 and was one of three the couple owned in Oklahoma

Miss Arnell stated that she felt that the decision by Judge Howard Haralson to allow lawyers for both her husband and for Continental Resources to be involved in the proceedings was 'inappropriate' in that it allowed them to 'double team' her.

The crux of the argument though comes down to how much money the company and Mr. Hamm made beginning in 1988, the year he and Miss Arnall were married.

During the trial it was argued that Continental’s growth stemmed mostly from passive factors, such as rising oil prices, and, under Oklahoma law, only the 'active' portion of wealth accrued during marriage in previously acquired assets is subject to division.

Miss Arnall’s lawyers contend however that Judge Haralson miscalculated what was due to her by attributing only a small portion of a $14billion rise in the value of Mr. Hamm's Continental shares during the marriage - 6 percent.

'As Sue Ann has stated previously, 6 percent is not a fair proportion of the wealth the couple accumulated during their marriage, and she trusts that a more equitable division of the marital estate will result from this appeal,' her legal team said in a statement. 

The Mansion: Miss Arnell also got the couple's second Oklahoma home located in Nichols Hill and worth $4.6million

Big growth: During the course of their marriage, Mr. Hamm's company's worth jumped from $50million to $20billion

Miss Arnall, who worked as a lawyer for Continental when she and Mr. Hamm married, and went on to take a series of executive roles at the company, also claims that Judge Haralson undervalued her own contributions to the couple’s wealth.

Most estimates have stated that Continental Resources was worth around $50million in 1988 when the couple married, which is just a drop in the well when compared to the $20billion behemoth it is today. 

A behemoth that Mr. Hamm has a 68 percent stake in, a stake he lost none of in the divorce as it was determined to be 'separate property.' 

All this, combined with lingering timeline questions presented by Miss Arnall that question whether strategic moves that ultimately yielded giant profits for the company happened before or after the couple's 1988 wedding, will likely cause this case to drag on for as long as two more years.

And there's somehow more.

That aforementioned $9billion fortune of Mr. Hamm's was in fact a $20billion fortune as recently as August, with the oil baron forced to watch over half his worth slip away due to a drop in the price of crude oil.

Filing for divorce in March 2013, Miss Arnall alleged in court papers that her husband was having an affair, citing that as the reason for termination of the marriage.

Big score: In 2012, Mr. Hamm was one of the select few named to the Time 100, an event he attended with his wife

Mr. Hamm had over the course of their marriage grown to become one of the richest men in the world, a far cry from his youth and a true embodiment of the American dream.

Born one of 13 children to a sharecropper, Mr. Hamm worked his way up, picking cotton as a child, pumping gas and fixing cars by the time he was 20 and eventually saving up enough money to drill his first well.

And while Mr. Hamm, who was previously married and has three children from that union, is no fan of the spotlight, he has not exactly shunned it over the past few years.

In 2012, Mr. Hamm became a big part of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign when he was appointed energy adviser, a gesture he thanked the politician for by donating $985,000 to the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future.

Mr. Hamm also hosted a fundraiser at his $4.6 million Nichols Hills, Oklahoma mansion for the Republican candidate, which raised more than $2million.

Friends in high places: 2012 was also the year Mr. Hamm became an adviser for the Romney campaign 

It is worth noting that the Nichols Hill mansion is no longer Mr. Hamm's but, along with a $800,000 home in Enid, Oklahoma, the property of Miss Arnall.

It was also in early 2012 that Mr. Hamm earned the biggest accolade of his life when he was added to the Time 100 for that year.

He and his wife attended the ceremony together that April in New York that also honored, among others, Marco Rubio, Supreme Court Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, President Barack Obama and Rihanna.

The two posed on the red carpet together, smiling for the cameras with their arms around one another, looking happy and excited. 

Miss Arnall would file for divorce less than a year later.
