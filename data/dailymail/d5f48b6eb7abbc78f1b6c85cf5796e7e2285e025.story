Dozens of women of all shapes and sizes turned out Wednesday wearing their bikinis to show their support to a Canadian mother of five who was openly taunted because of her stretchmarks.

Last week, Tanis Jex-Blake, 33, of Alberta, wrote an impassioned post on Facebook saying she was mocked by a two men and a woman over her body while she attempted to sunbathe at a local beach.

In the post, she said her alleged bullies pointed, laughed and pretended to kick her during her first visit to a beach in 13 years. And she included a picture of her stomach, which helped send the post viral.

Jex-Blake took part in the bikini protest along with supporters after she received thousands of positive comments on her post from around the world.

Demonstrators carried signs that read 'Wear your skin proud' and 'Girls aren't born hating their bodies. We teach them to,' according to CTV.

Jex-Blake was cheered on as she stripped down to her bikini in the city center.

She thanked her supporters and said she hoped a positive message about body image could be taken away from her nasty experience.

'I don't know any of these people,' she told the TV station. 'But they've all come out to show their support, and they're all rocking their bikinis. I love it.'

The defiant woman hit back at the vicious taunts by posting a picture of her sunbathing on Facebook along with an open letter to the group who abused her.

In the post she wrote: 'I'm sorry if my first attempt at sun tanning in a bikini in public in 13 years "grossed you out"'. 

'I'm sorry that my stomach isn't flat and tight. I'm sorry that my belly is covered in stretch marks. 

'I'm NOT sorry that my body has housed, grown, protected, birthed and nurtured FIVE fabulous, healthy, intelligent and wonderful human beings.'

In the post, she goes on to say: 'I'm sorry if my 33 year old, 125 lb body offended you so much that you felt that pointing, laughing, and pretending to kick me. 

'But I'll have you know that as I looked at your "perfect" young bodies, I could only think to myself "what great and amazing feat has YOUR body done?". 

'I'll also have you know that I held my head high, unflinching as you mocked me, pretending that what you said and did had no effect on me; but I cried in the car on the drive home.'

Mrs Jex-Blake said the group started 'pointing, laughing and pretending to kick me' as she attempted to sunbathe in public in a bikini for the first time since giving birth to her first child 13 years ago

The letter has now received hundreds of messages of support after local radio station Hot 107 Edmonton shared the post on its Facebook page. 

One Facebook user wrote: 'My wife has four kids... and we call her stretch marks "love stories". It's beautiful! Real men appreciate those stretch marks'.

Another wrote: 'What is wrong with people now a days? Seriously! And what are parents teaching their children that they feel it is ok to treat others like this. 

'Tanis there is nothing wrong with your body it's beautiful and yes you went through the miracle of child birth and those are your your medals for doing it.'

Mrs Jex-Blake told Global News: 'Initially I posted it with the hopes of word reaching them… but now it’s gone so much further.'
