A Washington, D.C. news anchor got a real earful during a live broadcast on Monday when an exotic insect got so cozy on his ear that he laid two eggs.

Fox 5's Bob Barnard was broadcasting from the Smithsonian's Museum of Natural History for a story on Museum Week when a palm-sized African Moon Moth unexpectedly landed on his head.

Largely unfazed, Barnard continued with his broadcast. When he was done, he discovered the the exotic bug had left behind a gift.

Barnard was doing a story on Museum Week in DC when the moth laid eggs in his ear. He had no clue it had happened until after the broadcast

The moth had previously caused Barnard a bit of a tickle, which he at first appeared to believe was a bite.

However, the insect zookeeper Barnard was interviewing informed him that African Moon Moths don't have mouths at all and are thus incapable of biting.

Their plump, green larvae, the zookeeper explained, do all the eating. The moths then live off the fat stores once they become adults.

'That African Moon Moth on my ear on live TV laid two eggs! (Yuck),' Barnard tweeted Monday. 

Big and beautiful: The African Moon moth measures around 4 inches across with tail-like structures dangling majestically from its wings. The moth likely laid hundreds more eggs after the two he left behind on Barnard

Perhaps that sensation he thought was biting was actually the moth laying her eggs.

Either way, the moth won't be around long enough to see if Barnard helps raise her young. The Moon Moth, unable to eat, lives only a handful of days.

She does, however lay hundreds of eggs--just a few at a time--before she dies.
