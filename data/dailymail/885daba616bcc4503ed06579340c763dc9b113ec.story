A British couple has been awarded £5,000 in compensation after their stay at a resort in Egypt was ruined by gastroenteritis symptoms.

Cristian Magana Salgueiro and Mark Trevelyan fell ill just days after they arrived at the Oriental Resort in Sharm el-Sheikh, a popular Red Sea retreat for UK tourists.

Mr Trevelyan was still experiencing gastric problems more than a year after the Somerset couple’s two-week getaway, while Mr Magana Salgueiro’s symptoms continued for two months following their return in July 2013.

Five days in to the holiday Mr Magana Salgueiro, 30, began to experience ‘severe diarrhoea up to 12 times a day, stomach cramps and inflammation of the abdomen’.

Mr Trevelyan, 29, also suffered severe cramps, diarrhoea, nausea, sickness and exhaustion.

They said they witnessed birds eating from the pasta station and plates on the resort’s terrace, and cockroaches swarming a designated food area during their trip, which was booked through Thomas Cook.

When they returned to Britain they both sought advice from their GP, but were asked not to attend their doctor’s surgery in case they may be contagious.

Traveller’s diarrhoea was diagnosed and antibiotics were prescribed.

The pair hired solicitors from Your Holiday Claims, a division of Farnworth Rose solicitors, to investigate the cause of their illness and they were recently awarded a four-figure sum in compensation.

Mr Magana Salgueiro said he is ‘very happy’ with the outcome of the couple’s claim.

Anne Thomson, head of travel law at Your Holiday Claims, said: ‘I’m very happy we were able to obtain compensation for Mr Magana Salgueiro and Mr Trevelyan.

‘High standards of hygiene in holiday hotels are vital or outbreaks of illness will continue to arise and more holidays ruined.

‘We have recently been contacted by more holidaymakers who unfortunately suffered similar gastric illnesses recently at the Oriental Resort.’

In a statement, Thomas Cook said: 'Thomas Cook is sorry that Mr Trevelyan and Mr Salgueiro fell ill while on holiday at the Oriental Resort in Sharm el-Sheikh in July 2013. We can confirm that we have reached an agreement with their legal representatives and that this matter is now resolved.

'We would like to assure customers that incidents of this type are rare, as Thomas Cook closely audits all the properties to which it operates to ensure that only the very highest hygiene standards are maintained.

'We would kindly ask any customers who may have concerns relating to their holiday to contact us directly and as quickly as possible while in resort or the UK so that we can deal with them personally in an open, honest and fair manner.'
