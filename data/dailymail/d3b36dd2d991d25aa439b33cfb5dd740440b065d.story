'A steady move away': The Most Reverend Justin Welby said that Church of England schools were moving away from using faith tests

Anglican schools are moving away from selecting pupils on the basis of religion, the Archbishop of Canterbury said yesterday.

The Most Reverend Justin Welby said faith-based entry tests were no longer the best way of choosing students.

‘There are unbelievably brilliant schools that are entirely open to all applicants without selection criteria apart from residence, where you live, and which produce staggeringly good results,’ he said.

‘It is not necessary to select to get a really good school. It’s a question of - and you can point to them all over the place - it’s a  question of outstanding leadership.’

The archbishop, who was educated at Eton but sent his five children to state schools, said having a more open policy on candidates without faith could be beneficial for the schools.

‘What you are seeing in the church schools is a deeper and deeper commitment to the common good,’ he added. ‘There’s a steady move away from faith-based entry tests.’

But after making the controversial remarks in an interview with The Times the archbishop appeared to row back.

In a statement, released by Lambeth Palace, he threw his weight behind selection by faith.

‘I fully support the current policy for schools to set their own admissions criteria, including the criterion of faith,’ he insisted. ‘Nothing in my wider comments on this subject should be seen as dissenting from this policy.’

About one million children attend the Church of England’s 4,484 primary and middle schools and 193 secondaries.

The schools are often oversubscribed and give preference to parents who regularly attend church.

Churches in the parishes of the most popular schools keep records of families who attend their services to curb parents who attempt to cut corners to get their children in.

Three-quarters of Church schools are judged good or outstanding by Ofsted whereas just 57 per cent of all state schools receive the same classification.

Rowing back? After his interview with The Times, the archbishop clarified that he supported schools setting their own admissions criteria

A move away from faith-based selection would not be welcomed by traditionalists within the Church or the parents who attend church regularly and expect their child to be given a place before someone with no faith.

Critics of selection on the grounds of faith say it can discriminate against less well off pupils. Andrew Copson of the British Humanist Association said: ‘One of the worst aspects of state faith schools is religious selection in admissions.'

It segregates pupils on the basis of their parents’ beliefs and on socio-economic and ethnic grounds. Any move to end it must be welcome.’

The Bishop of Oxford has previously called for CofE schools to cut down to one in ten the number of places reserved for practising Anglicans, even if it meant a fall in standards.

The Right Reverend John Pritchard, head of the Church’s education board, said two years ago that schools must serve ‘the wider community’.

Archbishop Welby spoke before addressing a conference on alleviating poverty.
