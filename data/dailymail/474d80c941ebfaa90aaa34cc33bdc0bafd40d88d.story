Loom bands may have been 2014’s bracelet of choice, but take a look around any office, gym, or High Street today and you’ll spot another kind of rubber bracelet.

Unlike the purely decorative loom band, these sleek rubber bands — some with a watch-like face, some just a simple bracelet — have a function.

Acting like mini personal trainers, these high-tech pedometers register calories burned, steps taken, distance travelled and even how well you’ve slept, handily logging all of the data on to an app on your smartphone.

They’ve been a huge hit with fitness freaks and desperate dieters alike, and look set to become even more prevalent as both Apple and Google launch their versions this year.

By 2018, it’s estimated that 130 million fitness trackers will have been sold worldwide — and they’re particularly popular in the UK, with more Britons wearing one than in any other country in Europe.

But sales figures aren’t the only things on the up. A growing body of rather worrying research suggests that, when it comes to counting calories, some of these high-tech, high-priced gadgets — which start at around £80 and can cost several hundreds of pounds — could, in fact, be completely wide of the mark.

Just last week, a study by Iowa State University in the U.S., revealed some of the bands could overestimate wearers’ calorie burn by as much as 40 per cent — a huge margin of error when you’re trying to work out how many calories you should be consuming.

Could this be why a raft of dieters on weight-loss forums across the web are joining discussions entitled such things as ‘My Fitbit [one of the most popular brands] is making me fat!’ with tales of gaining, rather than losing, pounds?

As someone who has become a devotee of the gadgets over the past six months, I didn’t want to believe the stories.

Anna completed the tests at Bath University with Dr Oliver Peakcock who measured her breath to get acute results

As the editor of the women’s health website healthista.com, I get sent new health products to test every day.

After a stint trialling the Nike+ FuelBand (£89, nike.com) — dubbed the A-list fitness accessory by Vogue, no less — I had become obsessive about tracking my calories and steps, and competing with myself to increase my daily activity.

But despite my slavish devotion to the technology, even I had begun to have my doubts.

Recently, I was sent another new tracker — the Misfit Shine (£79.95, johnlewis.com). One day, I wore both the Misfit Shine and the Nike+ FuelBand while doing my regular 30-minute morning workout and 25-minute walk to work.

But when I arrived at work, I noticed the Misfit Shine said that I’d burned 250 calories more than the FuelBand said I had. I was stunned. Which to believe?

I asked the manufacturers of both if they could send me studies conducted by the companies proving the accuracy of their trackers. Neither supplied them. Which is when I discovered that, actually, there isn’t much evidence out there at all.

Anna appealed to the companies that produce the fitness trackers to ask if they could provide her with studies conducted by the companies proving the accuracy of their trackers, but they didn't and she discovered there isn't much evidence available to prove the accuracy of the bands

‘There’s little published data from manufacturers on the validity of these fitness monitors,’ says Gregory Welk, professor of kinesiology at Iowa State University, who has conducted trials on fitness monitors, which also showed wide inaccuracies between their readings.

Reluctant to give up my fitness tracker addiction, I decided to put them to the test myself, pitting my Nike+ FuelBand and Misfit Shine against the other most popular models on the market — the Jawbone UP (£99.99, jawbone.com/up), the Fitbit Flex (£79.99, fitbit.com/uk/flex), the Garmin Vivofit (£99.99, buy.garmin.com) and the Ki Fit (£268.99, kiperformance.co.uk).

I began by wearing all six bands at once for a day to see how much of a difference they would show in calories burned — the main thing most of us are worried about when it comes to tracking activity.

Initally Anna wore all six bands to see the figures they came up with for the same activities, she found the calorie counters varied widely between all six of them

After my morning workout, my walk to and from work (25 minutes each way) and spending the rest of the day typing at my desk, the results ranged from 1,591 calories burned (the Jawbone UP) to a staggering 2,196 (the Misfit Shine).

That’s a difference of 605 calories that I might, or might not, be burning — or more than 4,000 calories a week, around the same number you need to cut out to lose an entire pound of fat!

It was a huge and alarming discrepancy, I had to admit. So, why was it happening?

Anna visited the lab of Dylan Thompson, professor of sport, health and exercise science at the University of Bath, where she was measured by his Indirect Calorimetry (IC) machine

Jon Denoris, a fitness trainer and author of The Pop-up Gym, has tested countless fitness trackers, and explains that most of them use something called an accelerometer — essentially a motion sensor — which registers your movements and feeds them into the device.

Using this information, your personal calorie expenditure is then calculated using the average burn of other people of your weight and height, making it a lot less scientific than you might think. Some are clearly more sophisticated than others.

In order to work out which was the most accurate, I visited the lab of Dylan Thompson, professor of sport, health and exercise science at the University of Bath, to be measured by his Indirect Calorimetry (IC) machine.

The results that came back from the experiment showed some areas where there were massive differences between the readings given by the different fitness bands

This involves wearing a mask that analyses the carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in your breath — the universally recognised gold standard technique for calculating calorie burn. Wearing the IC mask and each of my six bands, I carried out four different activities, with different levels of intensity and ranges of movement, for eight minutes each — walking on a treadmill; cycling on a stationary bike; sitting at a computer, typing; and packing groceries — to see how they stacked up.

All the numbers represent calories burned in the eight minutes. Here are the surprising results . . .

As you can see from the table, the results were not exactly impressive. For each of the activities, I ranked the trackers according to how accurate they were. The Garmin Vivofit came first or second in all our tests, with the exception of cycling — where it wildly underestimated the number of calories I’d expended.

Although I’d always far prefer that something underestimated than overestimated calories burned, lulling you into a false sense of security and giving you licence to over-eat.

In fact, the Garmin only thought I’d burned more calories than I actually had during one test, the typing test — if I was typing, as I often do, for eight hours, I would think I’d burned 960 calories when I’d only really have burned 600.

‘Every device will have some room for error,’ says Professor Thompson, although he points out that our trial wasn’t as controlled as a proper research experiment. That said, I wouldn’t invest in the Misfit Shine, which overestimated my calorie burn in almost every task — by more than 700 per cent in one case.

This experiment has made me question my devotion to fitness trackers. I’m not the only one. Recent research found that although sales are on the up, like gym memberships, they’re soon ditched, with a third of people abandoning theirs after only six months. I’m going back to that simple equation of moving more and eating less. It’s low-tech — but at least I know it works.
