Isaiah Nicholas repeatedly told his mother he did not want to die after being shot in the head in Houston

A four-year-old boy is in a coma after being shot in the head by a man who fired on a group of children playing.

Holding his mother's hand in an ambulance after the shooting in Houston, Texas, on Saturday, Isaiah Nicholas repeatedly told her: 'Mamma, I don't want to die'.

He was today said to be unconscious in a critical condition at the city's Hermann Memorial Children's Hospital, with his parents at his side.

Houston Police Department said the suspect is known, but still at large.

There were reports of an argument shortly before the shooting began.

Lisa Ceasar, Isaiah's grandmother, said she heard arguing outside at about 5pm and walked out to her porch at the moment a man began firing, according to the Houston Chronicle.

The 47-year-old said the man was aiming at the porch where she stood and a game room where six children, including Isaiah, were playing.

She said: 'It all happened so fast, but I went into shock.

'I saw that man shooting up my house and the bullets flying.'

Ms Ceasar ran inside and found Isaiah, her oldest grandson, with a gunshot wound to the head and his two-year-old brother, Adrian Nicholas, next to him covered in blood.

The children and adults at Ms Ceasar's house in northeast Houston were just about to eat dinner, having ordered chicken.

Along with three of her grandchildren, Ms Ceasar and her husband Robert were in the house as well as their daughter Rosharone Nicholas, whose friend brought her own three children.

The daughter's friend reportedly left the home for quarter of an hour to go to a local shop and the suspect is said to have followed her back to the house, where an argument began.

When he was first found, Isaiah's family said he was alert and able to speak, but he later slipped into a coma and was connected to a life support machine.

Ms Ceasar said: 'It was so hard to see my grandbaby like that. I just pray he can pull through.'

Figures released by the FBI last year showed that of 12,996 murders in the United States in 2010, more than two-thirds - 8,775 - were caused by firearms.

And according to the Child Trends DataBank, an American research body, guns were used in 85 per cent of teen homicides in 2007.

A wave of violence across the United States during its July 4 celebrations last year saw several youths suffer gunshot wounds, including two teenage brothers shot in Jacksonville, Florida.

One of the teenagers died from his injuries.
