A French anarchist charged with several attempted murders after a newspaper photographer was shot is said to be on hunger strike.

French newspapers reported yesterday that Abedlhakim 
Dekhar, 48 - who is accused of a string of shootings in Paris - has begun refusing food.

Sources said he is drinking water, but has so far refused to explain his actions or even spoken to police.

Assaulted ex-partner: Paris 'shotgun shooter' Abdelhakim Dekhar, seen here on CCTV at the Concorde underground station, was convicted of domestic violence in Britain before returning to France

The French
 Algerian extremist is the suspect in shootings last week at the offices of the Liberation newspaper, television station BFM TV and a bank. He is also believed to have forced a driver to take him into central Paris.

Dekhar, who fled to England in 1999 after a jail term for supplying a weapon to two infamous
French murderers, was charged on Saturday with several attempted murders and a kidnapping lasting fewer than seven days.

After a two-day manhunt, police found Dekhar semi-conscious in a parking garage after a suicide attempt.

He had a letter with him that spoke of fascist plots - and criticised capitalism and supposed media manipulation.

Dekhar fled to England in 1999 to escape surveillance by French authorities after he served four years for supplying a weapon to revolutionaries Florence Rey and Audry Maupin - nicknamed 'France's Bonnie and Clyde' - who murdered three policemen and a taxi driver.

Address: The block of flats in Ilford, Essex, where Dekhar is listed as having lived between 2000 and 2003

Accomplice: Dekhar was jailed for four years for supplying a gun to France's infamous 'Bonnie and Clyde' murderers Florence Rey, left and Audry Maupin, right, who 
murdered three policemen and a taxi driver

He worked in London and married a 
student in Redbridge in 2000, listing his address as a small flat close 
to Ilford Methodist Church.

He continued to live in England, where he also worked in a restaurant until July this year.

His sister Farida Dekhar-Powell still lives in the Essex commuter town of Shenfield and teaches French.

She said: ‘I stopped talking to him 20 years ago. He is not part of my life and that's how it stays.’

Dekhar
 was arrested in an underground car park on Wednesday night after taking
 an overdose of sleeping pills in Bois-Colombes, a Paris suburb.

It
 was the dramatic end to a manhunt that started last Monday morning when 
Dekhar allegedly critically wounded a photographer at the offices of Liberation 
newspaper in Paris.

He is then said to have 
opened fire on the offices of the Societe Generale bank in La Defense 
business district of Paris, before briefly taking a motorist hostage.

Dekhar's DNA matched genetic prints found on the shotgun cartridges the gunman used and the car he commandeered.

Police said they
 found letters written by Dekhar which referred to Islamism and 
conflict-ravaged Arab countries including Libya and Syria.

Danger: The gunman aims his weapon and fires during an attack on a French television station BFM TV

He also attacked the media and capitalism in general, saying they were both part of a ‘fascist plot’.

Dekhar
 spent four years in prison for buying a gun used in the 1994 attacks 
by Florence Rey, a 19-year old student, and her lover Audry Maupin, who 
murdered three policemen and a taxi driver.

Mr
 Maupin died in the chase, while Miss Rey, a fresh-faced student from a 
middle-class family, claimed Dekhar was the ‘third man’ in the ‘Bonnie 
and Clyde’ killing spree.

Dekhar,
 nicknamed ‘Toumi’ was under surveillance at the time, because of his 
links with a variety of radical groups, including would-be Islamist 
terrorists.

Witnesses
 at the trial in 1998 described him as a mentor to the couple and 
accused him of exploiting their youth to manipulate them.

In
 the early 1990s he was known to hang out at squats that were used by 
left-wing radicals and were often under police surveillance.

Despite
 
this, it took detectives three days to track Dekhar down following the 
attacks, suggesting the French authorities had lost track of his 
movements.

The 
23-year-old photographer wounded in last Monday’s attack has since 
undergone a six hour operation and is expected to recover.

Intent: CCTV from inside the television station captures the moment the gunman, dressed in a black sleeveless top and carrying a large dark sack, calmly walks down the stairs towards the reception

Close range: The wanted man gets to within a few feet before firing the shotgun

Escape: The suspect, who was described as white, in his 40s and shaven-headed, fled the scene
