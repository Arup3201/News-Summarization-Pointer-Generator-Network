Helen Smith, 42, couldn't believe her luck when a dress she made from 24,000 loom bands reached the high bid of £170,000 after she posted it on eBay.

And it seems that many more wannabe weavers are eager to follow suit and make a quick buck from their rubber band creations, with the online auction site being inundated with clothing and accessories made from the bright bands.

Fashion fans have crafted everything from bikinis to belts and even high-heeled shoes from the rainbow-coloured elastic bands.

Going loomy: Lots of loom band enthusiasts are listing their fashion creations on online auction site eBay

Yesterday saw the first ever man's 'loomkini' go up for sale on the site on sale at £30. The listing of 'thong made from the popular bands' was originally taken down as the image broke eBay's nudity laws but the product has since reappeared on the site using a different image to illustrate the design.

Sam Innes, 22, from Musselburgh outside Edinburgh, created the swimwear and has currently received six bids with the loomkini currently going for £51, which seems rather modest compared to Helen's huge profit. The 
auction for the loomkini closes on Friday at 3.24pm.

Even flip-flops and high heels created from the colourful bands are beginning to appear on eBay

The shoes aren't created entirely out of the bands but instead heels are decorated using the weave

Jumping on the band wagon: Helen Smith, 42, put her dress, made entirely from loom bands by her friend Katherine, on eBay and it reached £170,000 - since then the auction site has been inundated with loom band creations

If the bikini sells for that price it would yield a £45 profit (not factoring in the 24 
hours labour it took to create).

For some of the weavers their creations are more than just a hobby. One listing advertises a bodycon boob-tube style dress that is being sold to raise funds for a big day.

The dress was designed by Dani Hubbard 26, from Porth in Rhonnda, who enlisted her family to help make the dress which took them a grand total of 39 hours to create.

Too much skin: Innes's original advertisement showed more of his figure than eBay allows (right) but his item has since been relisted and the 22-year-old is currently fetching bids over £50

Dani is hoping that her efforts will pay for her wedding to partner Jamie.

According to The Mirror newspaper Dani is even hoping there will be enough to set aside a little extra to help buy her brother a car to thank him for helping with the dress.

'It was my brother's idea to make such a fashionable dress, and he helped me decide on the particular style we ended up with after we had discussed it. I haven't seen anything on the internet like it.'

Dani Hubbard is hoping that her complicated design might fetch enough to cover the cost of her wedding...not to mention a car for her brother

'I just thought that if the other lady could do it, then so can I. There's a huge craze going on at the moment with these bands, so I gave it a go' continued the hopeful bride-to-be.

However it appears that the increasing availability of loom band clothing is seeing the value of the garments decrease.

11-year-old Abigail Baker from Desborough, Northamptonshire, spent seven days crafting a loom band dress from 25,000 of the elastic bands.

A family affair: Abigail will spend her £45 profit on a fish and chip dinner with her folks on their next holiday

Abigail used £90 worth of the bands and saw her dress go under the hammer for just £155. However the school girl seemed unscathed and thanked her family for the support.

'My family have 
been the greatest throughout because they gave me the £90 to make this 
dress and have supported me all the way.'

Unlike Dani, Abigail has much more humble plans for her loom band profit. She said she wanted to raise at least 
£50 cash so she could give her four-year-old brother Liam £10, keep £20 
for her to spend in the arcades and £20 for a fish and chip dinner 
treat while on holiday in Weymouth, Dorset, next month.
