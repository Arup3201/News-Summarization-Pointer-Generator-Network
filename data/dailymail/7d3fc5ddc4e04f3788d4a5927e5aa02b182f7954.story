It is a traditional ceremony to welcome the beginning of spring, so it seems only appropriate that these Spanish women and girls wear floral dresses for the occasion.

The ladies of the city of Valencia dress up in their finest outfits and cover their hair to honour the Virgin Mary as part of the five-day celebration.

The event, showcasing the beautifully-dressed 'Falleras', forms part of the Fallas festival - a five day and night continues party and celebration held in commemoration of Saint Joseph in Valencia.

Locals parade from their respective districts to the Plaza de la Virgin in order to make an offering of flowers to Our Lady of the Forsaken, the Patron Saint of Valencia. 

With all of the bunches of flowers given by the falleras to the Virgin, an impressive 15 metre-high tapestry is formed on the main façade of the Basilica and a mantle is made for the Virgin.

The timing of the events is fixed and they fall on the same date every year, though there has been discussion about holding some events on the weekend preceding the Falles, to take greater advantage of the tourist potential of the festival or changing the end date in years where it is due to occur in midweek.

Fireworks, singing, dancing and music-playing are a constant theme of the celebration. The locals say that everything that is bad is burnt, and reborn fresh for spring.

Each neighbourhood of the city is required to produce a 'falla' - a wooden sculpture that is eventually burnt.

There are different speculations regarding the origin of the Falles festival. One suggests that the Falles started in the Middle Ages, when artisans disposed of the broken artifacts and pieces of wood they saved during the winter by burning them to celebrate the spring equinox.

Valencian carpenters used planks of wood called parots to hang their candles on during the winter, as these were needed to provide light to work by. With the coming of the spring, they were no longer necessary, so they were burned. 

Over time, and with the intervention of the Church, the date of the burning of these parots was made to coincide with the celebration of the festival of Saint Joseph, the patron saint of carpenters.

The timing of the events is fixed and they fall on the same date every year, though there has been discussion about holding some events on the weekend preceding the Falles, to take greater advantage of the tourist potential

The five-day celebration is full of joy, fireworks and singing, although the Offering of the Flowers is a more sombre occasion
