It's the TV series as famous for its sharp suits as it is for its slick storylines depicting life at a New York advertising agency in the Sixties.

But as fans prepare for the final instalment of Mad Men, one of the show’s leading ladies has a shock confession: she hates the outfits.

Elisabeth Moss, who plays secretary-turned-copywriter Peggy Olson in the acclaimed show, also said she would hate to turn back the clock to the Sixties because its ‘rampant sexism’.

Confession: Mad Men's Elisabeth Moss says she hates wearing panty hose (tights) and girdles from the era

Uncomfortable: Mad Men star Elisabeth Moss who plays secretary-turned copywriter Peggy Olson said she would hate to turn back the clock to the Sixties because of the 'rampant sexism'

Asked to name her greatest dislike of the period, Moss, 31, said: ‘Panty hose! And girdles and uncomfortable bras. The fabrics were just a bit too interesting – a lot of wool and polyester.

And if we’re done talking about how uncomfortable the clothes were, there was also rampant sexism.

‘The Sixties were a tough time for us ladies. There was perhaps a little more class to us at times, a little more mystery, which was nice.

But other than that there’s nothing I’d like to go back to.’

Christina Hendricks, who plays sultry Joan Harris, agreed that times had changed for better as far as women were concerned.

‘I
 was raised by parents who are very modern and liberal, so if I had been
 put into that era I would be kicking and screaming!’ she said. ‘I think
 we women are in a far better place now.’

The
 final series of Mad Men starts its run on Sky Atlantic in the UK on 
April 16 – seven episodes will be screened this year and the final seven
 will be shown in 2015.

All
 the actors concede there will be a huge hole in their lives, but 
January Jones, who plays Betty Francis, hopes the cast will stay in 
touch.

‘We might start
 a book club and meet once a month,’ she said. ‘Just a children’s book 
club though – we’re too busy to read a full-length adult book.
