Scaling a garden fence with ease, this little superhero knows nothing can stop him – even his exasperated mother.

Meet ‘Spider-Man’, the four-year-old boy who climbs out of windows and clambers over barriers twice his height.

His mission? To visit his grandmother, who lives two streets away and loves to give  him cake.

Spiderboy Jayden Hughes, four, will climb out of windows and scale walls and fences to get to his granny

Jayden Hughes, whose family gave him 
the nickname after buying him a Spider-Man costume for his birthday, has
 broken out of his home 16 times in the last six months.

Each time, he has been found eating cake at his grandmother Tracey’s house.

Things got so serious his mother Emma, 28, asked the council to fit a chain-link fence in their garden to keep him in.

But that could not stop Jayden. She 
has now applied for planning permission to erect a wooden panel fence at
 their home in Stoke-on-Trent.

Jayden has escaped more than 16 times in the last six months and goes to see his grandmother

Not even an 8ft high gate is enough to stop the little boy, who starts primary school in September

Jayden's mother is worried he might break a bone or get run over in the road if he carries on escaping

‘Jayden is a terror,’ she said. ‘He 
can literally climb over anything.

'He’ll do anything to get to his nan. 
He’s escaped about 16 times and it scares me.

'He clambers on to the 
window ledge and somehow gets out.’

England supporter Jayden can get past window locks easily before dropping several feet to the ground

Jayden still  manages to escape even when his mother locks all the doors and windows

The full-time mother of one added: 
‘He’s fallen off the fence twice already and I’m petrified he’s going to
 break a bone or get on to the main road and get run over.

'He is only 
young so he doesn’t understand the danger. He thinks he’s Spider-Man and
 it’s all fun to him.

‘I just hope he grows out of it but it means I literally have to keep an eye on him 24 hours a day. It’s exhausting.’
