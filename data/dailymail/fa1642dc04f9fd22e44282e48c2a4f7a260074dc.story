Uber says it's introducing two new safety features for riders in India in response to concerns about safety that followed a passenger reporting she had been raped by a driver.

The San Francisco taxi alternative company says it will launch a 'panic button' in its ride-hailing app that allows riders to notify the police in case of an emergency, and a 'safety net' feature that will allow users to share trip details and their location with as many as five other people.

Uber says it is also creating a local team that will respond to reports by riders and will get a notification when the panic button is pressed.

The company says the new features will be available Wednesday.

Uber did not say if the new features will be available in other countries, but said in an email that it will have more updates in the coming months.

Uber, valued at $40 billion, lets passengers summon cars through an app in more than 250 cities around the world. It faces multiple legal and regulatory challenges as it expands in the United States and abroad.

The Times of India reports that the new safety features are in response to the bans and threatened bans  by transportation department's in India and other countries.

Mumbai's transportation department held multiple meetings with Uber officials to discuss safety measures, the Times reports, the meetings were prompted by an allegation made by an Uber passenger who said she was raped by a driver in New Delhi in December.

She sued the company in January.

Department officials said that Uber failed to implement the discussed safety measures, including the 'panic button' and the 'safety net' feature, by the Jan. 15 deadline.

Department officials also said they were not happy with Uber representative's responses when discussing safety measures, according to the TOI.

Uber may challenge the ban in court, holding that the company is simply a 'technology platform' and not a taxi operator.

'We do not hire or employ drivers and so cannot be treated on a par with cab operators like Meru and TabCab,' an Uber official said.

'We also do not own cabs. We simply function as an aggregator and facilitate cabs for customers of our app.'

But department officials said that because the company accepts requests directly from passengers and provides them with cabs, along with accepting fares online, it is the company's responsibility to 'ensure that the driver or owner follows rules, and ensure adequate measures for passenger safety.'

The lawsuit alleges Uber isn't doing enough to keep passengers safe, and Uber may also face charges if Indian prosecutors believe it misrepresented the safety of its services.

The company says it plans to improve its safety programs in 2015 and is looking for new ways to screen drivers.

In India, Uber has been banned in New Delhi, the southern technology hub of Hyderabad, and the entire southern state of Karnataka. 

On its blog, Uber said the idea of a physical panic button wasn't feasible because it doesn't own the cabs.

It added that buttons would be vulnerable to wear and tear and said that if it and other operators were forced to put buttons in cars, passengers might get confused in an emergency.

Uber also said that the company does not own cars or employ drivers, instead, it partners with independent contractors licensed by the government and physical buttons would 'cause confusion.'

'Imagine you enter the vehicle of a driver who works on four platforms,'  the company said. 'His/ her car will need to have four physical panic buttons. 

'In a situation of distress the rider would have to pick the correct operator’s panic button to be able to get help on time. That’s 25 percent chance of success; and a decision that has to be made and executed in a split-second, if at all.' 

Uber said it would support physical panic buttons if the owner of the vehicle were responsible for installing them and if the button called the police directly.
