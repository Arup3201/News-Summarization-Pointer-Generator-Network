With her hair swept neatly into a bun and her pink silk sari draped elegantly over one shoulder, Jessica Michibata looked every inch the Bollywood star as she posed for pictures ahead of the Indian Grand Prix.

After posting a photo of her hennaed hands on Instagram and declaring herself to be feeling 'very Indian today', Michibata later told Indian news agency IANS that she was thrilled to have been able to indulge in a shopping trip while in India.

'I wanted to wear something Indian,' the model told the agency during an interview at McLaren headquarters.

'I have always loved the use of colours here. I am glad I got time to do some shopping,'

The 29-year-old model was at the Buddh International Circuit in Noida in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh to support boyfriend Jenson Button.

Although Button could only muster a 14th place finish - and failed to stop Germany's Sebastien Vettel from claiming a fourth consecutive Formula One world title - his loyal girlfriend was on hand to cheer him up as he emerged from the paddock.

The pair were seen strolling arm-in-arm through the crowds surrounding the track, although Michibata had by then swapped her hot pink sari for a pretty blush maxi dress.

The twosome have been a couple since 2009 and Tokyo-born Michibata is regularly seen by her boyfriend's side as he tours the world in pursuit of elusive racing success.

Although Button's racing results haven't been particularly eye-catching of late, Michibata's chic style most certainly is - with the model garnering fashion credit aplenty with her boho-luxe approach to dressing.

Earlier this month, she stole the show at the Korean Grand Prix in Yeongnam in South Korea, appearing in the paddock in a stunning floral dress teamed with a simple pair of tan ankle boots.

While Jessica has the sort of stunning features most women can only dream of, she once admitted in an interview with the Evening Standard that she has struggled to cope with the attention her looks bring her at times.

'I just wanted to be like all my friends. I didn't want to be special, or for people to think I was different,' she told the London newspaper.

'I asked my teacher once why I was getting all this weird attention. I said, "I've got two eyes, one nose and two lips, how come I look different?"'

Despite her good looks - and those of her other half - Michibata says neither of them get jealous when they get attention from the opposite sex.

'I never get jealous when women come up to Jenson and try to chat with him,' she insisted.

'I know lots of women fancy him because he's a Formula 1 driver and the world champion, not because they love his personality.

'I get the same thing happening with male fans. I have fans that love me crazily. One of them said he would have a tattoo of my face done on his body.

'He's a very true fan if that makes him happy. Jenson understands that, too.'
