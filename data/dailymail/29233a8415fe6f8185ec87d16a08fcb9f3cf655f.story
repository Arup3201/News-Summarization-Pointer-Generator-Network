Puma were left embarrassed after a hijacked Twitter ad campaign saw Monaco striker Radamel Falcao apparently leave a 'personalised message' that read: 'Liverpool are w***. Never stop believing.'

The Liverpool target, alongside Puma ambassadors Cesc Fabregas, Marco Reus and Usain Bolt, was subject to the prank  after users were asked to tweet the hashtag #ForeverFaster in order to receive a 'personalised' photograph.

The ad campaign was soon abused by those online, who realised they could change their Twitter username in order to make it look as if the sports stars were leaving offensive messages.

Not what they want to read: Radamel Falcao's 'personalised message' said that 'Liverpool are w***'

Bad taste: Cesc Fabregas's 'personalised' photograph was changed to read a crude message

Sportsmail reported on Monday that Liverpool faced competition from Juventus to nab the 28-year-old's signature, and Twitter did its best to intervene.

Fabregas felt Falcao's pain as the Chelsea midfielder's 'personalised message' read: 'I spread Ebola. Appreciate your support, Cesc.' There was also Borussia Dortmund star Reus, whose fake line read: 'Cocaine. I couldn't do it without you.'

The prank 
was not just reserved for football, though, as the 
fastest man in the world was caught out by the hijinks. A photograph that appeared to be signed by Bolt was changed to read: 'I'm erect. Forget the pack, follow your instincts.'

Liverpool will take little notice of Puma's PR disaster as they remain in contention to sign Falcao.

Manager Brendan Rodgers has Juventus, who are open to a loan move, and Real Madrid for company, although the Bernabeu outfit would have to sell a non-EU player first in order to make the move legal.

Immature: The prank was not just reserved for high-profile footballers - even Usain Bolt was caught out

Wrong: Borussia Dortmund's Marco Reus had his 'personalised' Puma message altered too
