A couple have been told they face court action after taking their two children out of school during term-time despite being refused permission by one of the establishments.

Annette and Michael Putt, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, have been ordered to appear before magistrates next month after refusing to pay fines of £60 each over their son's unauthorised absence.

They had asked permission from each child's school to take son Harrison, 14, and daughter Ruby, 11, out of classes during term-time so that they could go on a five-day family getaway to Wales in June last year.

The couple were told by Ruby's school - St Gerard's Catholic Primary in Rotherham - that she could have time out of lessons for the holiday, but Harrison's school - St Bernard's Catholic High - denied the request.

Despite the rejection, Mr and Mrs Putt went ahead with the five-day break, travelling to Porthmadog in North Wales.

They claim that they cannot go on holiday out of term-time because it is 'too expensive'.

Upon their return, they were told that Harrison's school had notified the local authority of his unauthorised absence.

In 2013, former Education Secretary Michael Gove ended the right for schools to grant up to 10 days holiday per year for pupils.

New guidelines state that children should only be taken out of school during term-time if it is an 'exceptional circumstance'.

Government rules state that it is at the discretion of each individual school to authorise or reject absence requests.

Under the current system, parents who take their children out of school without permission could face a £60 fine per child, rising to £120 if it is not paid within 21 days.

Failure to pay the fine can result in prosecution, with a maximum fine – if convicted – of £2,500 or a jail sentence of up to three months.

Mr and Mrs Putt now face a court hearing after refusing to pay the £60 fine they were each handed over their son's absence.

Mrs Putt, a care worker, said she was 'really upset' about the court action and said they had gone away because the trip was a gift from the children's grandparents.

She told The Guardian's Sally Weale: 'I can't actually believe that someone's going to name and shame me in court.

'I'm not a criminal. I haven't hurt anyone. I'm not a bad person. I'm a normal mum, wanting to give our children some family holiday time.

'My little girl's school said it was fine to take her for five days, my son's said no. What was I meant to do? Was I meant to leave my son at home and go on holiday, or not let my little girl go on holiday?'

A spokesman for Rotherham Borough Council said the decision to fine or prosecute a parent is determined by the central government policy which takes the view that parents shouldn't take their children out of school during term-time in order to raise educational attainment.

It is not the first time parents have faced court action for taking their children out of school.

Kerry Capper, 25 (pictured), was cleared at Birmingham Magistrates' Court last year for keeping her daughter off school for seven days. She said she let cancer-sufferer daughter Libby off school to 'keep an eye on her'

Plymouth City Council fined 41-year-old salesman Jason Short (pictured) £120 for taking his seven-year-old daughter Madeleine on holiday to Turkey in June, during the only time he was allowed to take off work

Since the changes were brought in by Mr Gove, more than 60,000 families have been fined by councils for taking children out of school without approval.

Dozens of parents have been convicted by magistrates' courts after refusing to pay penalty charges of £60 per child, rising to £120 if not paid within 21 days.

In one of the most high profile cases, Kerry Capper, 25, was ordered to pay a £120 penalty fine for keeping her daughter off school for seven days.

Miss Capper said she let her daughter have the odd day off to 'keep an eye on her' as she was recovering from cancer.

In 2010, her daughter Libby Bennett had been diagnosed with a tumour in one of her kidneys, but recovered after several months of chemotherapy.

Michael Gove

As a result of the crackdown on term-time absences imposed by former Education Secretary Michael Gove in September 2013, headteachers can no longer grant up to 10 days’ holiday a year.

Instead, they can allow leave only in ‘exceptional circumstances’

Each parent who ignores a ban faces a £60 fine per child, rising to £120 if it is not paid within 21 days.

Failure to pay the fine can result in prosecution, with a maximum fine – if convicted – of £2,500 or a jail sentence of up to three months.

The move was intended to stop families damaging their children’s education by taking them away when holiday firms offer cheaper holidays.

A quarter of primary schools have punished parents for ignoring bans.

But families and headteachers say the rules are applied haphazardly. For example, a struggling school may be stricter because absences are noted during inspections.

The cancer has not come back but Libby remains under the care of Birmingham Children's Hospital for regular check-ups.

Between January and March last year Miss Capper kept Libby at home for a total of seven days when she felt unwell, instead of sending her to Paget Primary School, in Pype Hayes, Birmingham.

She was ordered to pay the fine, but cleared of a criminal act.

In another case, a five-year-old girl was refused permission to go with her parents on the family's first holiday abroad.

Pauline and Craig Stephenson from Cramlington, Northumberland, asked Northburn Primary School for leave to take their daughter Lauren to France for a week in September.

Because of his work commitments as a police officer, Mr Stephenson was not able to take time off during the six-week holidays. The school refused but the family still went.

In a separate case, James and Dana Haymore, from Chelmsford, refused to pay Essex County Council a £120 fine for taking their three children to the U.S. to attend a family memorial service.

Mr Haymore refused to pay a £120 fine from his local council and was expected to appear in court where he faced a £2,500 fine and a jail term.

But the council said it was no longer in the public interest to pursue the case as the family left to live in the U.S.

Elsewhere, 41-year-old salesman Jason Short left his job, so he could take his family away during the school holidays.

Plymouth City Council fined Mr Short £120 for taking seven-year-old Madeleine on holiday to Turkey in June, during the only time he was allowed to take off work.

He claims he had explained the situation to teachers at Salisbury Road Primary School in Plymouth and was told not to worry but was later hit with the fine.

But he returned home after the break to find he had a letter from the council stating he would be fined for taking Madeleine out of school without permission.
