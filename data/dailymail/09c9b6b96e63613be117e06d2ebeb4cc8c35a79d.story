Mother-to-be: Nikitta Grender, 19, who was allegedly raped and killed by her boyfriend's cousin Carl Whant

A young mother-to-be was raped in her own home and repeatedly stabbed - killing her and her unborn baby just two weeks before she was due to give birth, a court heard today.

Nightclub bouncer Carl Whant, 27, is accused of raping his cousin's girlfriend, eight-month pregnant Nikitta Grender, 19, before knifing her to death at her home.

A jury was told Miss Grender was just two weeks away from giving birth when she was stabbed in the neck and stomach causing the death of her unborn baby already named Kelsey-May.

The court heard how Miss Grender was 'looking forward' to the birth of her baby with boyfriend Ryan Mayes, who is Whant’s cousin.

The pair were 'well-prepared' for the birth of their baby girl - and had bought a cot and pram ready for the big day.

Father-to-be Mr Mayes had gone for a night-out with family and friends but when he returned he discovered Miss Grender dead in the burned-out flat in the Broadmead Park estate of Newport, South Wales.

Prosecutor Greg Taylor said: 'Nikitta was alone at home in the flat in the early hours where she should have been safe for the rest of the night.

'Her boyfriend Ryan was out in pubs, nightclubs and a house party with his cousin Whant.

'Someone entered that flat, someone raped her, someone murdered her and in the process destroyed her unborn child.

'She was stabbed right through the neck cutting her carotid artery.

'She was also stabbed in her stomach and the knife penetrated the unborn baby.'

The court heard the bed Miss Grender was found lying which was deliberately set on fire.

Mr Taylor said: 'This was an attempt to cover up these crimes making it appear Nikitta Grender had died in a tragic house fire. The man who did that was Carl Whant.'

Newport Crown Court heard Miss Grender had become pregnant by her long-term boyfriend Ryan, who was just 17 at the time.

Mr Taylor said: 'They had been in a relationship for three of four years although they were both still in their teens.

'Nikitta fell pregnant and was expecting her child in February 2011. They moved into a new flat the previous September - Nikitta’s mother lived around the corner to help her out.

'Nikitta visited the midwife regularly with Ryan and they were both looking forward to the birth of their child.

'Nikitta and Ryan knew the baby was going to be a girl and had already given her the name Kelsey-May.

'They had decorated one room in the flat and had bought a cot and pram - they were well prepared.

'When Nikitta was killed she was a fortnight off giving birth.'

The court that heard that on the night of February 4 last year Ryan went to a pub to watch a rugby match on TV with Carl and other friends and they ended up at a house party.

But while he was out, Miss Grender and their unborn baby were killed.

Forensic tests on her baby showed DNA signs that Whant had sex with Miss Grender.

Mr Taylor told how Miss Grender disliked Carl Whant - and ruled out that she had consented to sex with him.

He said: 'It was common knowledge that Nikitta disliked Carl Whant - he was a self-confessed cocaine user and she thought he was a bad influence on Ryan.'

Firefighters were called to the teenage couple’s flat in Broadmead Park, Newport, after a 999 call from a neighbour.

Mr Taylor told how firefighters arrived to see smoke billowing out of the windows of the first-floor flat.

Mr Taylor said: 'The fire was started deliberately there is no doubt about that. It was to mask the murder.

'The firefighters broke through the door and inched their way across the floor when a five-foot ball of flame rolled across the ceiling from Nikitta’s bedroom.

'When they got into that room they could see Nikitta’s body on the bed. It was heavily charred.'

The court heard Miss Grender was just 5ft 3in and weighed 7st 10lbs even though she was heavily pregnant.

Miss Grender's mother Marcia and father Paul were in the public gallery as the jury heard details of the alleged murder.

Whant, dressed in a black suit, striped shirt and black tie, took notes as he sat in the dock.

Whant, of Bettws, Newport, denies murder, child destruction, rape and arson.

The hearing continues at Newport Crown Court.
