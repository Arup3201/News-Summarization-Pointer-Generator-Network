The former model who was allegedly shot by her boyfriend in a failed murder-suicide after he killed a Utah cop was arrested over the weekend, accused of giving police false stories.

Traci Vaillancourt, 34, was arrested on two counts of suspicion of obstruction of justice late on Saturday and spoke to an attorney for the first time since the September 1 incident on Sunday.

Vaillancourt - who was disfigured and was left hooked on painkillers after getting a rare blood disease - was allegedly shot in the back by her boyfriend Timothy 'Troy' Walker, 35, while sitting in their Volvo in Draper, Utah.

This was just moments after Walker is accused of shooting dead Sgt Derek Johnson, 32. Walker then turned the weapon on himself and was hospitalized. He remains in serious condition.

On Saturday Salt Lake County Jail released a probable cause statement saying that investigators spoke with Vaillancourt on Sept. 1, 4 and 7, but all three statements were found to be inconsistent with evidence from the scene.

Officers suspect the pair were on drugs when Sgt Johnson spotted their car parked awkwardly. Police believe that Walker ambushed Johnson while he was sat in his patrol car.

Sgt Johnson was married to his high school sweetheart Shante Sidwell with whom he had a 6-year-old son Bensen.

His funeral was held on Friday where the community paid tribute to man described as a dedicated public servant.

According to the Deseret News, his sister Desirae Johnson said: 'I love you and I am so proud of you for giving your life to what you loved and believe in. I promise I will never forget you and look for signs of you wherever I go.'

On Sunday night Vaillancourt met attorney Matthew Kober at the Salt Lake County Metro Jail, also reported by the Deseret News.

Kober said the woman being held in the medical unit, in a wheelchair and wearing a sling. According to the lawyer, Vaillancourt is in a lot of pain and on medication.

'I asked a lot of questions. She answered to the best of her recollection,' Kober said.

'This is the first time I've been able to meet with her to understand her side of the story and find out her version of events. We're finding out everything about as quickly as the media is,' he continued.

The attorney said that he still needed to talk to police about which of his client's statements they thought were inconsistent.

'There are still some facts I want to follow up and understand better,' Kober said. 'She is aware multiple shots were fired. She expressed her concern for the fallen officer and is in a very emotional state.

'All along we thought she was a victim in this matter,' he added.

Speaking in response to the crime, Vaillancourt's sister Victoria King has revealed her sister's tragic demise from aspiring model and TV star to drug-addled homeless woman reliant on her violent boyfriend.

After having her first child, Vaillancourt was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder called Hereditary Angioedema which made her face, throat and limbs swell, her sister told KSL.com.

She says her sister quickly became addicted to her pain medication after suffering four strokes before the age of 30.

'It just went downhill from there,' King told the broadcaster.

'I tried to get him away from her. She chose a different path. … He was bad news from the get-go, I knew it, and the two of them combined, and a loaded gun nonetheless, and strung out on drugs.'

'We tried and tried and tried to help her but you can't help someone who won't help themself,' she added.

King last saw her sister and Walker, 35, the day before the shootings and was left startled by his behavior.

'He got out of the car and he was hyper, showing me a gun that has a laser and a machete and knives,' she said.

The couple were trying to talk King into giving them cash - an event which wasn't unusual according to Vaillancourt's older sister.

They have a daughter together who lives in full custody of her paternal grandmother.

Ms King told Salt Lake Tribune that her sister was not without remorse at what had become of her life but couldn't work her way out of the cycle of addiction.

'She would cry, ‘I never pictured my life turning out like this,’' King told the newspaper.

According to King, Walker gave Vaillancourt attention and Vaillancourt 'was attached to him at the hip'.

She says the pair have been living in and out of motels and were most recently living out of their car.

She says the couple told her they needed protection and that's why they had purchased a cache of weapons. 

'I know she was a victim, but I felt like I already lost her a long time ago. My heart is absolutely bleeding for Derek Johnson’s family,' King added in the interview.

'I just want them to know I’m sorry'.

Walker has a history of petty crime but nothing that would indicate the murder he is accused of carrying out on Sunday.

Vaillancourt too has a record of theft and shoplifting but nothing violent.

'The streets of Draper City were made safer by Sgt. Derek Johnson who loved his job as a police officer for the Draper City Police Department,' Johnson's family wrote in his obituary.

'Understanding the risk, but wanting to protect he gave his life while on duty Sept. 1, 2013, at the age of 32.

'He was the recipient of many awards, including Life Saving Award, Distinguished Service Award, and was the 2012 Community Policing Officer of the Year. With a good nature, a sense of humor that could light up any room, attention to detail and the ability to make anyone his friend.

'He made a difference. He loved his family, hunting, running, hiking and giving service. He was always up for a good challenge,' it reads.

The police officer, promoted last year, tried to drive away after the shooting and crashed his patrol car into a field.

The owner, Dan Smith, hung ribbons in his memory.

'There's no words that can explain it and make it ok,' Smith said. 'It obviously tugs at your heartstrings and you want to do something to show that it wasn't in vain.'

The local sheriff Jim Winder says Walker had a desire to shoot a uniformed officer.
