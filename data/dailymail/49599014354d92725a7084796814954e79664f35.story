Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, pictured, is said to be furious after High Court judges made it illegal to ban foreigners who have never set foot in Britain from claiming legal aid

Human rights judges sparked anger yesterday by ruling it illegal to ban foreigners who have never set foot in Britain from claiming legal aid.

To the fury of Chris Grayling, the High Court said introducing a residence test to tackle abuses of taxpayers’ money was ‘unlawful and discriminatory’ and pandered to prejudice.

The Justice Secretary had brought in measures, due to be enacted next month, to prevent overseas nationals receiving public money for civil claims until they have lived in Britain for at least a year.

He took urgent action after ‘disturbing’ claims emerged that a group of Iraqis whose lawyers secured millions in legal aid had actually conspired to allege British soldiers executed and tortured prisoners.

Currently there are no nationality or residence restrictions on funding, which leaves Britain with a huge annual bill of £2billion.

But in a highly unusual move, Lord Justice Moses – who last year branded the legal aid reforms a ‘joke’ – shot down the laws before they had even come into force.

Invoking the controversial Human Rights Act, he ruled the radical crackdown was ‘not lawful’ and banning foreigners from accessing legal aid breached their rights to a fair trial and not to face discrimination.

In an extraordinary ruling, he said Mr Grayling’s claim that the curbs were vital to ‘command public confidence’ amounted to ‘little more than reliance on public prejudice’.

The Ministry of Justice said it intended to appeal the ruling.

But Mr Grayling was understood to be furious.

A source said: ‘It’s not fair to expect UK taxpayers to pay the legal bills of people who have barely stepped over the border.

‘The residence test is a common sense approach that required people to have a strong connection to the UK before they could be given civil legal aid.’

The Government pushed the new laws through Parliament last Wednesday after concerns over the Al Sweady inquiry into claims British troops abused prisoners in Iraq.

After a year-long hearing, which cost taxpayers £23million, the case sensationally fell apart in March when lawyers for the Iraqis admitted there was no evidence in a central claim – that insurgents were murdered.

It is claimed the Iraqis – who have no residency rights in Britain and all live overseas – would never have got up to £10million in legal aid if the full facts had been known at the time.

The 33-year-old – granted anonymity to protect his family – successfully argued foreign aid helped the regime inflict ‘brutal treatment’ on thousands of farmers driven from their land.

Now the ruling, by three judges, opens the doors for legal aid lawyers based in Britain to trawl overseas to find more cases to bring against the authorities.

The legal challenge came from the legal charity Public Law Project, which said the test would discriminate against migrants as well as ‘those unable to prove past residence including women fleeing domestic violence, pre-school age children and the homeless’.

But the Ministry of Justice said exceptions from the residence test would have included asylum seekers, children, vulnerable people including victims of domestic violence and forced marriages, and refugees.

A MoJ spokesman said: ‘Legal aid is paid for by British taxpayers and we do not believe it is fair that people without a strong connection to the UK should be eligible for civil legal aid when it is funded by taxpayers’ hard-earned money.

‘The Government believes that, in principle, people should have a strong connection to the UK in order to benefit from the civil legal aid scheme and that the residence test we proposed is a fair and appropriate way to demonstrate that connection.’
