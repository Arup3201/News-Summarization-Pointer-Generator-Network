A disturbing YouTube video filmed on a New York subway in which a woman accuses a man of giving her AIDS has been revealed as a 'prank' posted by a New York City 'actress'.

Every seasoned New Yorker has at least one subway horror-story, but the altercation between the man and woman would surely reach the top of the list for most.

The premise of the prank is a woman getting into a fight with a man on the subway because he gave her AIDS.

Subway horror: A bewigged Waters gets into a fight with her 'boyfriend', accusing him of giving her AIDs

Quite a performance: Zaida Waters describes herself as an actress - but fortunately not a comedian

The video was uploaded to YouTube earlier this week and has since been viewed more than 23,000 times.

The end of the video flashes up with a Facebook page for a woman named Zaida Waters. That page contains is a link to the video, as well as many others, described as 'pranks'.

Waters describes herself as an actress on her Facebook page and also has a YouTube channel full of other offensive pranks, including one in which she pretends to go into labor at Coney Island (complete with fake blood and gore) and one in which she spits on a man presumably in on the 'joke' and gets into a physical fight with him on a subway. 

For someone who professes to want to bring happiness to people's lives, Waters has strange way of going about it.

'Hey everyone,’ reads her YouTube channel description.

'Welcome to Msmuffin’s channel..if you like to watch comedy pranks, you’ve came to the right darn channel ;p..I hope you enjoy my videos... I wish the best to you all and stay strong ..and oh do me a big fav keep a smile on them beautiful faces, life’s too short to be stressing ;)..stay tooned you guys have a great day.'

In training: Passengers must listen to this couple scream obscenities during what must have seemed like the longest subway ride ever

At an early point in the latest video in response to the woman's violent shoving, the man says, 'What are you going to do now? You got AIDs, you can't do nothing about it... What, you going to give it to other people?'

To which she responds, 'Yeah! I'm going to give it to him, and him, and him,' she says pointing out men around the packed carriage.

Other people in the carriage appear upset and uncomfortable while the couple push and slap at each other and employ some colorful language.

Confrontation: The fight continues apace (left) while a passenger tries to reason with the pair before giving up (right)

The man calls the woman 'disgusting' and forcefully grips her arms as she accuses him of giving her AIDs and having a 'dirty d**k.'

The script was decidedly lackluster, consisting mostly of, 'Get off me, you gave me AIDS,' from the woman, and 'You gave yourself AIDS,' from the man,interspersed with obscenities and physical violence.

As if her idea of AIDS being comical didn't already let on, it appears Waters has a fundamental misunderstanding of the illness which, if she had indeed been infected, would have manifested as HIV and not full-blown AIDS.

Bystanders: The man physically lifted Waters and tried to drag her bodily from the carriage

At risk: One brave woman stepped in to try and help Waters, unaware the pair were playing an elaborate and distinctly unfunny prank

An education: It's unclear what Waters intended viewers of her video to learn

As the six-minute-plus video progresses, the fight escalates to violent pushing and terrifying screaming and yelling.

When the crowded train pulls into a station other passengers on the train gratefully move towards the doors as the couple continue their act.

Suddenly, the man grabs the woman and begins to physically carry her from the carriage as she screams and holds onto the pole.

Other passengers run to help and demand the man let go of her, which he eventually does.

'MsMuffin' published the video on her YouTube channel with the message, 'Let this be a lesson learned,' but it's unclear exactly what the viewer is supposed to glean from the video - except, perhaps, beware of the subway.
