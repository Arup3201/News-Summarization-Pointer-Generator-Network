Tom Ince is closing in on a loan move to Derby County - but Hull City are asking for a fee of £300,000. 

The Rams are reluctant to part with such a hefty amount, particularly because east Midlands rivals Nottingham Forest didn't pay a penny for a loan earlier in the season.

But Ince is happy to leave the KC Stadium in pursuit of first team football and is keen on playing for Steve McClaren.   

Tom Ince joined Hull in the summer on a free transfer after leaving Blackpool at the end of his contract

Blackpool will receive up to £2.3m compensation for Ince because he was under 24 when he left for nothing

A number of other Championship clubs are interested in the winger, who has failed to hit the ground running since his summer move from Blackpool. 

Ince allowed his contract to run down at Bloomfield Road and joined Hull on a free transfer, although they had to pay a compensation fee of £2.3million. 

The 22-year-old has found himself in and around Steve Bruce's squad since Christmas but a temporary move away suits all parties.  

Steve McClaren wants to sign Ince on loan but isn't keen on spending £300,000
