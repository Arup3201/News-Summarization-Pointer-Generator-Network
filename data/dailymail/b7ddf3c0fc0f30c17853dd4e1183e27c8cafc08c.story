Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says all levels of the government are working to tackle the threat of Australian jihadists returning home with 'new-found abilities and talents in terrorism'.

Ms Bishop's comments come after a chilling video was released by the extreme terrorist group, Insurgent group Islamic State in Iraq and Levant (ISIL), also known as ISIS, with Australians calling on their fellow countrymen to join them in their fight in Syria and Iraq.

She said the Government was aware Australians were heading to both Syria and Iraq to join up with jihadist groups, putting the number of those already involved in the fighting at 150.

US President Barack Obama shares Julie Bishop's concern about the threat posed by returning jihadists.

'We are particularly concerned with the reports of Australians who are heading off not only to train, but to take leadership roles in radicalising others," she told ABC television on Sunday.

'The fear is they will come back to Australia with these new-found abilities and talents in terrorism.

US President Barack Obama shared similar concern about the threat posed by returning jihadists.

'Our National Security Committee is discussing this matter, and we are working out ways to ensure that Australians are safe from what I find to be a deeply disturbing development in our domestic security'

'There is no doubt the problem in Syria is one that we have been paying a lot of attention to over the last couple of years as you see jihadists coming in from Europe and as far as Australia to get trained and then going back into their home countries,' he told CNN.

Ms Bishop said the overseas insurgents' activities were being monitored and assessed all the time, and the government was 'ever vigilant' to ensure Australians were kept safe from the threat posed by returning fighters.

All ministers, agencies and departments were involved in seeking to solve this problem, she said as the government had already cancelled a number of passports.

'We are doing what we can across government - it is a topic that is engaging the Australian government at every level,' Ms Bishop said. 'Our National Security Committee is discussing this matter, and we are working out ways to ensure that Australians are safe from what I find to be a deeply disturbing development in our domestic security.'

The 13-minute recruitment video titled, There Is No Life Without Jihad, shows five extremists urging people to 'respond to Allah' and 'wake up and be part of the effort'.

Two of the militants are thought to be Australian, and one who is identified as Brother Abu Yahya ash Shami and speaks with a strong Australian accent is believed to have been killed shortly after the taping.

In response to reports that Australians were fighting in the extremist group in the Middle East on Friday, Prime Minister Tony Abbott warned the government has 'absolute determination' to prevent 'returning jihadis' who are a threat to the country.

Mr Abbott said Australia can't have 'trained killers who hate our way of life, who hate us, making mischief with the potential to cause mayhem in our country'.

'The important thing is to ensure that as far as is humanly possible, they don't come back into our country,' he said. 'And if they do come back into our country, (that) they are taken into detention.'
