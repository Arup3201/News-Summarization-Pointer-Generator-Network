Gareth Barry became the joint record holder for being shown the most yellow cards in Barclays Premier League history when the Everton midfielder was booked against former club Manchester City.

The caution was the 33-year-old's 99th in the league, putting him on par with Kevin Davies and Lee Bowyer.

Former Bolton striker Davies tweeted: 'Had a great run but all records are there to be broken!! Morning!!' before later adding: 'How dirty is Gareth Barry by the way!!! Ha.'

Barry now has 99 bookings in his professional career in the Premier League after Saturday's latest yellow

Kevin Davies remains joint top but is about to lose his crown with Barry still playing in the Premier League

Davies is about to lose his yellow card record, which stood at 99 after years in the Premier League

Davies is unlikely to get a chance to hit back with the 37-year-old striker now playing his football away from the top flight and in League One with Preston North End. 

He picked up the total playing for Southampton, Blackburn, and Bolton in the Premier League.

Barry is almost certain to overtake Davies and Bowyer as he continues to thrive for Everton.

However he will not have 'chance' to do it immediately. 

The former England midfielder's booking against City was his fifth in the Premier League this year and means he will be suspended for Everton's next match against QPR.

Below the three players on 99 Premier League cautions are a lot of the usual suspects including Paul Scholes, Robbie Savage, Dennis Wise and Roy Keane.
