Children aged 12 run the highest risk of being killed or seriously injured as pedestrians, a major new report to Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin reveals today.

There is a sharp and alarming peak in casualty rates when youngsters reach this landmark birthday.

And the absence from schools and TV of traditional road safety campaigns like the Tufty Club of the 1960s and Green Cross Code man of the 1970s and ‘80s may be to blame, say experts.

Protective parents keeping their children close to home for longer and only letting them ‘play out’ when they reach secondary school may be another factor, they add.

Shocking: This graph shows a stark spike in road casualties for 12-year-old children

The report called ‘Stepping Out’ also highlights a ‘post-code lottery’ of pedestrian child casualties with up to half of those killed or injured in the worst areas being children.

But it also shows that in up to 60 per cent of cases, the pedestrians themselves are wholly or partially to blame by not paying proper attention to the road.

The report was commissioned by the respected Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety (PACTS) and written by experts at Banbury-based Road Safety Analysis. It has the approval of  the Institute of Advanced Motorists and the Safer Roads Foundation.

The report and its supporters said the Government must do more to tackle pedestrian deaths – particularly child deaths – after years of improvements had stalled.

The report concludes bluntly: ‘The age at which pedestrians are most at risk is 12 years old, with one in 651 children of that age reported as a pedestrian casualty.’

Children are not prepared for the walk to school when they reach secondary school age, say road safety campaigners. File picture

Children are more likely to be injured in spring and summer, excluding August, compared to adults where the danger months are between October and January.

The report is being presented to the Transport Secretary at a special PACTS conference in London to mark the UN’s Global Road Safety Week. It comes as 25 leading road safety and transport experts have signed  a letter (to The Times) demanding the Government do more to improve road safety and encourage walking.

Some 453 pedestrians were killed in Britain in 2011, a quarter (24 per cent) of all road deaths and a rise of 12 per cent on 2010. The letter says one in four British adults is ‘obese’ and this will double by 2050. Yet only a quarter of English primary pupils are allowed to walk to school and back, compared with three-quarters in Germany.

PACTS executive director David Davies said that compared to a generation or so ago when Tufty Club and the Green Cross Code were commonplace and repeated regularly on TV, road safety lessons in many schools were now ‘patchy’ and public funding for such campaigns is diminishing.

The erosion of road safety campaigns like Tufty the squirrel and the Green X Code may be behind the figures

He said casualties were peaking at 12 because that was when pupils start secondary school and become more independent.

He said: 'They may not have had any significant pedestrian or road safety training.

'My impression is that pedestrian safety training used to be routine for years but is being squeezed out because of pressure from the national curriculum.’

Report author Richard Owen, a director of not-for-profit Road Safety Analysis and a father of two children – a son aged five and an eight-year-old daughter – said: ‘I grew up in the 1970s and ‘80s and everyone knew the Green Cross Code from school and TV. That’s not the case today.'

He added that protective parents were keeping their children home during primary school years and only letting them out from secondary school age: 'It may be that what road safety lessons there are are aimed at seven, eight and nine-year-olds when maybe it is 11, 12 and 13 year olds who need it today.

It’s only when they get to that age at secondary school that parents feel more confident of letting them out on their own. But though they are older, they don’t have the road safety skills.’

The Riskiest place for children is Blackburn, with Darwen having the highest proportion (50 per cent higher risk of child pedestrian casualties than the national average), followed by Burnley (49 per cent), Oldham (48 per cent), Pendle (48 per cent), Barnsley (46 per cent), Barrow (46 per cent), Hartlepool, North East Lincolnshire, Hyndburn and Mansfield (all 45 per cent).

The lowest proportion of child pedestrian casualties are in Westminster (11 per cent), Kensington and Chelsea (12 per cent),  and Camden in London (16 per cent),  followed by West Somerset (16 per cent), Wandsworth (17 per cent), St Albans (18 per cent), City of London (18 per cent), Islington (18 per cent), East Cambridgeshire (19 per cent) and Colchester (19 per cent).

For all pedestrians, Newham in London is the riskiest place with a risk level double that of the national average. It is followed by Hackney, Preston, Haringay, and Blackburn.

Lowest risk areas are Daventry where the risk to pedestrians is 60 per cent lower than the national average. It is followed by neighbouring Harborough, South Cambridgeshire,  East Cambridgeshire, the Western Isles and the Vale of the White Horse.

Pedestrians ‘failure  to look properly’ is the biggest contributory factor in accidents –representing nearly six out of ten cases -  followed by pedestrians being ‘careless, reckless or in a hurry’ cited in  about a quarter of cases.  Next comes ‘driver failed to look properly’ at about 1 in 5 (20 per cent).

Pedestrians killed and seriously injured has fallen significantly in the last 30 years from 19,035 in 1980 to 5,605 in 2010.

But the report stresses that pedestrian casualty reduction has slowed and actually increased in 2011. Despite these falls, the percentage of  all killed or seriously injured casualties who were pedestrians has remained remarkably stable (22.9 per cent in 2010 vs 22.4 per cent in 2010.).

Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: ‘As this report recognises, the UK has some of the safest roads in the world for pedestrians, with the number killed or seriously injured falling significantly over the last 30 years.  However we cannot afford to be complacent.’

‘Casualties for children under 15 have fallen considerably.  However, we know that one death is one too many, which is why we are working directly with local authorities and other partners to ensure our road safety messages are reaching children and teenagers in schools.

‘We are also improving the resources  provided to schools - both at primary and secondary level.’

Tragic: Bilal Khazir was killed by a hit-and-run driver in Bradford last October

The death of Bilal Khazir at the age of 12 shows the dangers faced by children after they are first allowed to go out on the streets on their own.

Bilal was returning from a friend's birthday party to his Bradford home in October when he was hit by a car as he crossed the road in a scooter.

He had used a pedestrian crossing to get to the other side of the main road, but driver Zain Khan did not see him as he was travelling at well over the speed limit.

Bilal was thrown more than 50 metres in the collision, and later died of his injuries.

After his death, the schoolboy's family described him as 'one in a million', adding: 'For the rest of our lives we will have family occasions, gatherings and celebrations ruined because Bilal is missing and there is an empty chair.'

Khan, 21, was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison after being found guilty of killing Bilal, fleeing from the scene of the accident and subsequently lying to police.
