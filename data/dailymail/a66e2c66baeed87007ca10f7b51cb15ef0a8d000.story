While the country braces itself for more storms and freezing temperatures, the politicians in the House of Parliament are found to be throwing their heat away.

Thermal images have revealed that the government building is wasting ‘copious’ amounts of energy due to a suspected lack of proper insulation.

The images, taken by energy supplier npower, also found The Savoy hotel was leaking energy, yet the Shard in London Bridge was found to be the most energy efficient.

Npower used thermal imaging to discover that the Houses of Parliament, pictured, waste 'copious' amounts of energy every day. This discovery was made worse by the fact 36% of people said they don't have insulation in their own homes because the government doesn't offer enough support

Npower claims a quarter of heat loss in homes is 
through the roof, due to poor insulation.

The firm worked out that average three bed home in the UK could save £140 a year by installing cavity wall insulation.

Solid wall insulation could save customers £490, while loft insulation could reduce their bills by £180.

Npower's national survey also found that the main reasons for not putting energy saving improvements in place include: 42 per cent not being able to afford it, 36 per cent blaming lack of government support and a third who claim the problem isn’t big enough.

This discovery is made worse by the fact 
36 per cent of people claim they haven't got sufficient insulation in 
their own homes because the government doesn't offer enough support.

Npower took the images as part of a nationwide campaign looking into energy efficiency and insulation. 

Npower's UK heatmap also found that Britain’s most exclusive homes, including those in Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster, are among the worst for heat loss.

In the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea, 83 per cent of homes don’t have cavity or solid wall insulation.

At the other end of the scale, and country, people living in the Outer Hebrides and Aberdeenshire conserve the most heat - with 65 per cent of homes in both regions filling in their walls.

Npower also accused The Savoy hotel on London's Strand, pictured, for leaking heat. The energy supplier took the images as part of a nationwide campaign looking into energy efficiency and insulation

The boss of npower was, himself, 
accused of wasting energy at his home earlier this week after images from two properties 
belonging to Paul Massara, the energy firm's chief executive, showed 
evidence of poor insulation.

Massara
 owns two homes - one a 16th century country property in Upper 
Wolvercote, Oxfordshire and another terrace home in Clapham, south 
London.

Thermal images taken
 of both properties found them to be 'far less energy-efficient than the
 average family home,' according to Andy Smale from independent 
consultancy Expert Energy.

According to the heatmap, more than half of Britain’s 26million homes are wasting energy by allowing heat to escape through walls and roofs.

For example, in Gateshead, only 27 per cent of homes meet the guidelines for loft insulation.

Commenting on the findings, Phil Spencer, from Location, Location, Location said: ‘Alarmingly, more than half of home owners still don’t know how to establish how energy efficient their home is and are missing out on cost savings which could run into 100s of pounds each year.'

A number of energy suppliers headquarters were also captured on thermal imaging camera in November last year.

Images were taken at head offices of four of the big six suppliers: E.ON in Coventry, EDF in West London, Centrica in Windsor, Berks and npower in Worcester.

Experts said the pictures reveal just how much energy the companies are wasting.
