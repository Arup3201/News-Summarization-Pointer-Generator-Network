The death of a high-profile mystery shopper known as 'the master of disguise' has sent shivers through the tight-knit world of mystery shoppers and led some to speculate that she was attacked because of her work.

Marjorie Hillerman, 61, was found December 9 in the parking lot of Livermore Premium Outlets in northern California with a severe head wound. She died a week later. 

Police are baffled by her death. The injuries to her face and head suggest she could have fallen. However, the wounds could have been delivered by an attacker. 

At least one friend fears she was murdered.

Victim: Marjorie Hillerman's injuries were revealed while she was in a parking lot for the Livermore Premium Outlets on December 9 

The Independent Mystery Shoppers Coalition, a trade group that represents people who pose as customers to evaluate customer service at stores and restaurants, has warned its members to be on guard and wary of attack, the San Jose Mercury-News reports. 

'We don't believe she just fell. She wasn't that type of person. She was just too on top of things,' Pamela Olmstead, president of the Independent Mystery Shoppers Coalition and a friend of Hillerman, told the newspaper.

'It has frozen our community. That's the impact she had on us.' 

Hillerman was well-known among mystery shopper and had a reputation for being able to quickly change her appearance so that store clerks wouldn't recognize her. 

No one saw what happened that day, and no CCTV tape is available, the website reported. Police told the website that it does not appear a robbery took place.

Friend: Pamela Olmstead, a friend of Marjorie Hillerman, has said Hillerman was known as 'the master of disguise' 

Speaking about the investigation, Officer Steve Goard told Bay Area News Group 'It's been a struggle. It could have been a fall or an assault; it could be any number of things. ...It's baffling.'

'There's nothing that leads us in any one direction,' he also said.

Goard also told the media outlet that it doesn't seem the 61-year-old Hillerman got inside Livermore Premium Outlets whatsoever. She had all of her items and her rental car was unharmed, he also said.

In a release issued earlier this month, Livermore police said 'We received information from the public regarding a white 4-door sedan that was seen leaving the area around the same time as the incident.'

Hillerman's friend Pamela Olmstead of the Independent Mystery Shoppers Coalition told Bay Area News Group that Hillerman often spoke at conferences for the mystery shopper industry. Olmstead also stated that the upcoming conference will include safety instruction.  

Bizarre: No one saw what happened that day at the outlet mall, and no CCTV tape is available

Speaking to NBC Bay Area, Olmstead said 'What I fear happened is that either someone wanted something she had, or they hit her with a car and left out of fear.'

'It's my hope somebody's going to be watching this and say "Hey, I saw that incident, I saw what happened" and come forth and tell somebody so we can find out what happened,' Olmstead also said.

Speaking about her friend's nickname, Olmstead told NBC Bay Area 'Margie could go from being a brunette to a blonde to blackhead to long hair, wearing jeans to wearing a skirt in a matter of seconds.'

A GoFundMe page is raising money to get Hillerman's remains to her home state.
