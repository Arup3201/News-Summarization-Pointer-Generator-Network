A 23-year-old nurse who bumped into a man who allegedly tried to rape and kill her on a Mumbai train was overcome with fury and launched into a rage repeatedly slapping the man.

The handcuffed man was held back by two policemen while the woman yelled at him and hit him, naturally being filled with rage at seeing her alleged attacker.

The confrontation, which was captured on the police station's CCTV, comes just days after four Indian men were sentenced to death for the brutal bus gang rape of Jyoti Singh who eventually died of her injuries.

Rage: A 23-year-old nurse who bumped into a man she accused of trying to rape and kill her on a train was filled with fury and began slapping the man

Anger and frustration among women in India has been increasing as violent attacks on girls are frequently being reported and the government has been forced to address the growing issue.

Seizing the rare opportunity of having the upper hand, this nurse struggled to hold back these feelings, as she repeatedly hit her alleged attacker.

According to NDTV.com, the nurse had been travelling on an early morning train in Mumbai on July 27 when a 'drunk man' boarded her carriage.

The 27-year-old man tried to force himself on her. She alleges he tried to rape her; he has also been charged with attempted murder, the news service said. 

Outraged: The woman had gone to the police to report the alleged attack which happened on an early local train in Mumbai as she travelled to work

Police said she accused the man of boarding the train drunk and then trying to rape her

The woman raised the alarm and the man was arrested when he got off at the next station

The nurse raised the alarm on the train and when her attacker got off at the next station, the man was arrested by the local railway police.

The woman went to the police station herself to report the crime and while she was there officers brought in her alleged attacker. They had just completed a medical examination on the man.

Clearly extremely upset, and then outraged when she saw the man, the nurse confronted him.

Police said she wanted to talk to him and give him a piece of her mind, but the exchange became  more heated.

The news service says while no one should take the law into their own hands, the police understood her state of mind at the time, and she was still outraged at the alleged attack.

There were at least three police officers in the room, watching, at times more people come and go.

The news service points out that despite her lasing out, the woman 'bravely' continued to lodge her complaint. In India, many women have been too afraid to report such crimes, for fear of being shunned in public and due to police corruption in parts.

Guilty: Vinay Sharma (left), 20, and Mukesh Kumar, 26, have also been ordered to the gallows over the attack

NDTV.com also noted that every train in Mumbai should have a police constable on it patrolling the carriages, but on this occasion there was none, because he had apparently missed the train. A 'dereliction of duty' charge has now been registered against that constable.

On average, a case of rape in India is reported every 21 minutes, but it was only after the horrific fatal gang rape and torture of Jyoti Singh last December received global media attention, that the government has has stepped up its reaction to the crime.

The victim, who was raped for an hour and tortured with an iron rod on a moving bus, became a symbol of the dangers women face in a country.

After violent protests in several cities the government, initially caught off guard, introduced tougher rape laws in March, and for the first time opened conversation about gender crime in television debates, social media and even Bollywood.

Still, sex crimes remain commonplace in India, and social commentators say patriarchal attitudes towards women have not been diluted by more than a decade of rapid economic growth.
