The day the children finally leave home for good has traditionally been seen as a sad time.

But rather than seeing the empty nesting period as a moment to mourn, it seems parents are making the most of the opportunity.

Make way for the 'escaping nesters': a new breed of over-50s who are making the most of the lack of responsibilities at home and heading abroad to fulfill their travel dreams.

And they're off! It seem that over 50s are making the most of their children leaving home and use the time to travel

It seems that for over half of respondents, it is not a time tinged with sadness but one of great excitement and a time to remember what they wanted to do with their life before children.

A recent survey has shown that over 60 per cent are happy to leave any responsibilities they may still have at home behind in favour of pursuing their travel dreams.

A resounding 90 per cent feel that now is the time to visit their dream destinations whilst they are still fit and healthy and over 40 per cent feel they can indulge in their passion for travel because their children have finally left the nest.

Not a care in the world: The survey reveals that over 60 per cent of over 50s are happy to leave any responsibilities they may still have at home to pursue their travel dreams

The over 50s are a travel-hungry and adventurous bunch with the top wish list destinations being New Zealand and the Canadian Rockies, followed by Norway Northern Lights, Galapagos Islands and even Alaska.

Other dream destinations include Japan, Croatia, India, Cambodia and the Baltic States.

A spokesperson for All Leisure Group, 
who carried out the survey with Travelsphere, said: 'This survey has 
thrown up some very interesting findings.

'The majority of over 50s feel 
it is now their turn to enjoy and indulge themselves.'
