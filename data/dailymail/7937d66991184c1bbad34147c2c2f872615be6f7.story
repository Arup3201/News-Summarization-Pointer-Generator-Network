She has retained the model good looks which turned her into a star in the Swinging Sixties without ever going under the knife.

But now Twiggy has admitted that she would no longer rule out help from a surgeon.

Yesterday the 63-year-old said her only aversion was to Botox, which she thinks can make people look ‘like munchkins’.

Taking a stance: 'I haven't had work done but that's not to say I won't. The thing I'm against is the things they pump into your face and lips'

And while she will never get it injected into her, she said she may consider surgery in the future.

She said: ‘I haven’t [had work done] but that’s not to say I won’t. The thing I’m against is the things they pump into your face and lips.

‘People who have had it done can look like munchkins. It’s peculiar. I’m very anti-Botox as I feel it’s dangerous.’

In an interview with Good Housekeeping magazine, Twiggy also spoke about being wary about diets.

She said: ‘I don’t think diets work, because you deprive yourself of the things you love. I’ve been fascinated recently by the fasting diet, though.

‘My downfall is crisps and bread. If I eat bread every day for a week, I can feel it around my tummy. So if I stop for a week, I can really feel the difference.’

Twiggy, who became the face of London
fashion after becoming a model in 1966 aged 16, remains one of the most
influential women in fashion and the so-called ‘Twiggy-effect’ is 
believed to have inspired women in their Sixties and Seventies to dress 
more stylishly.

She has 
designed a line of clothing for Marks & Spencer as well as a range 
called ‘Twiggy London’ that is sold on a U.S. shopping channel and 
managed by her husband, actor Leigh Lawson.

The couple have not had children 
together but Twiggy, whose former husband, actor Michael Whitney died in
1983, has one daughter, Carly, 34, who got married earlier this year.

Twiggy
said: ‘Carly is my best friend, especially now she’s a grown woman. She
really makes me laugh. She got married this summer and I’m so ready to 
be a grandmother!’

She added: ‘My daughter and I go shopping together. We’ll sometimes buy the same jeans or jacket, but we wear it differently.’

Full interview appears in the September issue of Good Housekeeping, on sale Thursday 1 August. Also available as a digital edition.
