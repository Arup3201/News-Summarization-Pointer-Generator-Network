Prue Leith said the bureaucracy involved in going through the ingredient in every new dish would be difficult and time consuming

Restaurants, cafés and schools are being forced by the EU to identify and list 14 potential allergens in their food.

Prue Leith, the renowned cook and TV food expert, condemned the changes as a ‘bureaucratic nightmare’ that make life very difficult for small restaurants to change their menus and offer a ‘dish of the day’.

The law comes into effect later this year and will fundamentally change the way all food is sold in supermarkets, restaurants, office canteens and schools.

Anyone selling food will be required to label allergens under one of 14 headings – ranging from gluten to soya, milk and mustard to sesame, lupin and sulphur dioxide.

However, while this might be a simple task for the big brand chains who have a limited range of standard items, like McDonald’s and KFC, it will be an enormous burden for independents who change their dishes based on the fresh ingredients that are available.

The new rules are designed to protect the estimated 21 million Britons who claim to have food allergies and will be policed by council trading standards officers, who can bring prosecutions and fines.

Miss Leith said the bureaucracy involved in going through the ingredient in every new dish to decide whether it includes one of the 14 allergens would be difficult and time consuming.

‘My worry is that it will kill innovation and experimentation in the kitchen and cooking what is available daily in the market,’ she said.

‘Fine for formula restaurant chains which never change their menus and have bureaucrats to work out how any milligrams of anything a dish has, but for proper cooks - a nightmare.’

The chairman of the Restaurant Association, the 7th Earl of Bradford and runs Porters in Covent Garden, said: ‘It is typical of the heavy-handedness of the EU to bring in something like this.

‘It is ridiculously complicated and almost impossible for most restaurants to comply with.

‘It is well intentioned, obviously, and all restaurants want to protect their customers from harm, but this is just so complicated.

The labelling will be easy for huge corporations like KFC and McDonald's to comply with because they have limited menus

‘You have to audit every menu item, but also, if you buy in sauces, for example, you need to go to the supplier and get the allergen details from them, which is difficult and complicated.’ 

He said staff in his two restaurants are trained to offer advice on allergens, but he said: ‘If we are required to print all the details on the menus, they will become an absolute travesty.

‘What people who have allergies need to do is to alert the staff when they visit a restaurant. If the staff are trained properly, they will then be able to explain which dishes they will have a problem with,’ he said.

Restaurants will be required either to provide information sheets or chalk boards listing the allergen contents of each dish, or to have members of staff who are trained to provide the information dish by dish.

The changes also present huge challenges to catering companies and the nation’s school chefs, who are struggling to cope with the implementation of the new free school meals for the youngest primary school age children.

Catherine Hinchcliff, the head of customer marketing at Bidvest 3663, a foodservice wholesale distributor, said that there had been little discussion in the education sector around the changes, which form part of the Food Information Regulations and come into force on December 13.

‘That will require any caterer effectively to provide information about the allergy implications of every dish on every menu,’ she said.

‘If things change, if the recipes change or substitutions come in they’ll need all the right processes, back of house to be able to make sure that that information’s up to date. It’s actually quite a lot to take on board.

1. Gluten containing cereals 2. Crustaceans 3. Molluscs 4. Fish 5. Peanuts 6. Lupin 7. Tree Nuts (such as walnut, hazelnut, almond etc.) 8.  Soya 9.  Eggs 10.  Milk 11.  Celery 12.  Mustard 13. Sesame 14.  Sulphur dioxide

‘It’s a lot of work with understanding the allergens behind each dish, understanding the processes behind that, making sure there’s information available for front and back of house teams about what allergens sit in what dishes, doing all the kitchen audits to make sure that there’s no risk of contamination.’

She added: ‘There doesn’t appear to be very much useful research anywhere that allows us to understand what are the incidents of multiple allergies – how many children have allergies across all the 14 allergens. Do we just come up with a totally allergy free recipe or do you focus on egg, dairy, nuts?

‘That’s a real challenge for us all if we’re developing recipes.’ 

The penalties for serving food containing ingredients that include allergens without making this clear to customers can be severe, even under the current law.

In May last year, Jamie Oliver’s Portsmouth restaurant was fined £8,500 after it served pasta to a coeliac after she requested a gluten free meal.

Britain’s Food Standards Agency described the new allergen labelling rules as ‘good news for consumers’.

It said: ‘The new regulation brings EU rules on general and nutrition labelling together into a single regulation to simplify and consolidate existing labelling legislation and applies in all member states.

‘These changes will provide allergen information in a clearer and more consistent way; making it easier for people to make safer food choices when buying food.’
