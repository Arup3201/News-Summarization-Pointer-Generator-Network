The notebook of one of two 12-year-old girls suspected of stabbing their best friend 'to please' the fictional online character Slender Man was released to a Wisconsin court today, giving a frightening insight into her troubled mind.

The disturbing hand-sketched pictures were revealed during the preliminary hearing of Morgan Geyser on Tuesday, where a judge was tasked with deciding if the girl should be charged with attempted first degree murder as an adult.

Drawn by Geyser, one of the grotesque cartoons depicts a young cat-like girl armed with a scythe standing over a dead girl with a speech bubble that says, 'I love killing people'.

Eerie and prescient sketches: This is one of Morgan Geyser's sketches. The 12-year-old is one of two girls accused of stabbing her friend Payton Leutner and leaving her in the woods in May 2014. In this frightening picture a girl who appears to be a cat-like and armed with a scythe stands over a dead girl while saying 'I love killing people'

Other writings and cartoons profess her admiration and devotion to the Slender Man urban myth and will be a central part of the defense team's claim that Geyser is mentally unfit to stand trial as an adult.

If the two girls are tried as adults and found guilty they will face up to 60 years in prison. 

Indeed, along with the sketches, the court was presented with the mutilated body of one of Geyser's Barbie dolls, which had its hair and limbs cut and what appeared to be satanic markings drawn onto the torso. 

In addition to that was a list of 'supplies necessary' which included a 'map of forest' and 'weapons (kitchen knife).'

Anissa Weier and Geyser are thought to have lured their friend Payton Leutner to the woods in Waukesha, Wisconsin, and stabbed her 19 times after inviting her to a slumber party for Geyser's 12th birthday.

Ms Leutner was able to crawl out from the trees and has survived the May 2014 incident.

Lawyers for Weier and Geyser, who could be tried as adults for attempted murder, are pushing to have the case moved to juvenile court, according to ABC News.

Neither of the suspects has entered a plea as the attorneys attempt to get the charges changed. 

The two girls' attorneys have never denied they attacked and stabbed Leutner, but claim they were so disturbed they truly believed the Slender Man - a popular online urban myth - would kill their own families in three seconds if they did not do his bidding.

Geyser's attorney began proceedings on Tuesday by trying to telling the court that his client is mentally disturbed and believed she had to kill to protect herself and her family from the creature.

Taking the stand during the second day of a preliminary hearing, psychologist Deborah Collins testified that she has interviewed the Geyser several times and concluded she honestly believes Slender Man exists.

'(Her belief) hasn't wavered and it's been unyielding to a rational perspective,' Collins testified.

Collins also testified that the girl told her she uses Vulcan mind control to keep negative emotions at bay and believes Harry Potter villain Lord Voldemort visits her when he's not away on business trips.

Strange embrace: The Slender Man character is known for stalking and abducting children and became popular after fans of the creation did their own drawings of him

Urban myth: Obsession: On the left is a depiction of the urban myth of Slender Man - an unnaturally tall, thin figure with a blank, featureless face, wearing a black suit. His horror stories tell how he kidnaps children or forces them into murderous deeds

Checklist: This hand written note from Morgan Geyser's sketchbook shows a list of 'supplies necessary' before she and Anissa Weier stabbed their friend, Payton Leutner, in the woods last year. Noticeable is the reminder to bring a 'kitchen knife', a 'map of forest' and 'the will to live'

State of mind: This sketch will be used by the defense to claim that their client was and is mentally unfit and should stand trial as an adult for murder

A private detective working for the defense testified he discovered more than 60 drawings of Slender Man in the girl's bedroom. 

Many of the sketches included notes such as 'not safe even in your house' and 'he is here always.' 

One drawing depicted a girl lying on the ground and a person standing over her with the message 'I love killing people' written over the figure.

The detective went on to say he found more than a half-dozen Barbie dolls in the bedroom that had been marked with Slender Man's symbol. 

Some were missing their hands and feet.

'I think we did a good job showing she believed (Slender Man) was real ... across time and environment,' defense attorney Anthony Cotton said. 

'She believed in Slender Man. She believed he would hurt the family.'

According to court documents, the girls told detectives they had been planning to kill Peyton Leutner for months. 

They are accused of luring her to a park in the Milwaukee suburb of Waukesha on May 31 and stabbing her 19 times. Leutner barely survived; one stab wound just missed her heart.

The alleged attackers were found walking toward the Nicolet National Forest, where they say they thought they would join Slender Man.

All three girls were 12 years old at the time of the incident.

The two alleged attackers face one count of being a party to attempted first-degree intentional homicide in adult court. They each could face up to 60 years in the state prison system if convicted.

The Slender Man is a fictional character prevalent on the internet after originating as a meme in 2009.

The mythical creature is often depicted as an unnaturally tall, thin figure with a blank, featureless face, wearing a black suit.

The character is said to have long, tentacle-like arms, which can be extended to capture prey. 

It is said to stalk, abduct and traumatize children and, depending on interpretations of the myth, can cause memory loss, insomnia and paranoia.

It is also said to be able to create distortions in photographs and teleport.

It is understood to have originated in a Photoshop contest on the Something Awful Forums in 2009.

It then went viral with numerous works of fan art and short scary stories published online known as 'creepypasta'.

The character has developed its own life online, with two feature-length films funded in part by Kickstarter appearing in 2012.

The meme that appears most is that of a tall malevolent figure, who silently stalks down his prey.

Over the past six or so years, the Slender Man meme has mutated liked all good scary stories into one that haunts the minds of those who become obsessed with it. 

Decision: Circuit Judge Michael Bohren presides over the second day of a preliminary hearing in Waukesha, Wisconsin for the two girls accused of stabbing their classmate to please horror character Slender Man

Laughter after recovery: Ms Leutner was able to drag herself out from the woods where she was stabbed 19 times and has since recovered

Unidentified: One of the two Wisconsin girls accused of stabbing their classmate appears in court where their attorney's are trying to convince a judge to move their case into juvenile court

Police detectives testified on Monday that both girls believed they had to kill their friend and join Slender Man in order to protect themselves and their families from his wrath. 

Cotton is trying to use that to move his client to juvenile court, where she couldn't be held beyond age 25.

He contends that since the girl thought she was defending herself a charge of attempted second-degree intentional homicide is more appropriate. 

Since the girl is under 18, she would face that count in children's court.

Prosecutors countered that a preliminary hearing - the stage of Wisconsin's legal process where a judge decides whether enough evidence exists to move to trial - isn't the proper venue for such an argument. 

Judge Michael Bohren declined to rule on anything Tuesday, asking all sides to submit briefs. He promised to issue a decision on March 13.

The other girl's attorneys called only one witness Tuesday, a sheriff's deputy who arrested their client on the road. 

He testified the girl told him someone would kill her family unless she did something bad.
