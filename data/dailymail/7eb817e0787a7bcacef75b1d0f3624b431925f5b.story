Mitt Romney should have donated $10 million to the Red Cross instead of 'taking advantage of a tragedy', the Ohio Democratic Party chairman has said.

'I think Governor Romney ought to be focused on things he could do and say on behalf of the victims, rather than going to Dayton Ohio - the most important swing state in the country - and taking advantage of a tragedy,' said Chris Redfern according to the Washington Post.

'Look, I’m a partisan. I’ll let others judge this. But I think someone of Governor Romney’s wealth could have just written a check for $10 million to the American Red Cross and then spent today with his family. He chose to do something much different. He chose to politicise this.'

Redfern is best known for having used a 2010 union event to describe critics of Obama's healthcare reform as 'f***ers'.

The
 attack regarding Hurricane Sandy is likely to be a preview of the 
Democratic flak Romney will face throughout Wednesday as he holds three 
campaign events in Florida after President Barack Obama cancelled all 
his overt electioneering and will instead be going to New Jersey to see 
hurricane clean-up efforts.

Romney,
 a strict Mormon, has been far more generous to charities than Obama or 
Vice President Joe Biden in terms both of dollars and percentage of 
income.

According to 2011 
tax returns released in September, Romney and his wife Ann gave 29.4 per
 cent of their income to charity last year, giving $4.02 million out of 
the $13.7 million they earned.

In
 contrast, Obama and his wife Michelle gave 21.8 per cent to charity, 
donating $172,130 of the $789,674 they received - a sharp jump from 
previous years. Biden and his wife Jill gave just 1.5 per cent of their 
income, donating $5,540 out of $379,035 they earned.

Over the years, the Romneys, who are 
estimated to be worth more than $200 million, have given tens of 
millions to charities, mainly those connected to the Mormon church. 
Mormons are traditionally required to 'tithe' 10 per cent of their 
income.

Romney’s event in Kettering, Ohio was 
billed as a ‘storm relief’ event and attendees were asked to bring 
non-perishable foods and other items for left in need by the storm.

People
 left blankets, deodorants, tinned food, torches, batteries, 
toothbrushes and nappies on long tables and messages on two large 
television screens asked people to text the  American Red Cross to make 
donations.

Romney stood on a
 chair and spoke for less than five minutes. ‘We have heavy hearts as 
you know with all the suffering going on in a major part of our country -
 a lot of people hurting this morning,’ he said.

‘We're looking for all the help we can get for all the families that need.’

The Romney campaign had previously planned to hold a campaign rally at the same venue and despite the hasty switch and the removal of campaign signs and banner many of the trappings of a campaign rally remained.

A giant American flag was hung above a stage and a campaign music soundtrack of ‘Country Girl’ by Luke Bryan and ‘It’s America’ by Rodney Atkins played. Press credentials given to reporters still described the event as a ‘victory rally’ and one supporter wore a ‘Fire Obama’ T-shirt.

On Tuesday, Romney faced repeated criticism for his Kettering event with hosts and guests stating that donations of goods were not encouraged by the American Red Cross -  whose headquarters Obama visited in Washington - and that money was required.

Republicans pointed out that Romney had asked people to donate money and the American Red Cross details were very prominently displayed at his event.

Speaking on MSNBC, Mayor Kasim Reed, an Obama supporter, said: 'I think that this is just another moment where you see the clear striking difference between a president who has a heart for the American people and someone who simply wants to be president of the United States.'

When host Martin Bashir said 'indeed', he continued: 'would agree. It’s compassion that shows through in times like these.

'It’s humanity that shows through in times like these, and it just seems clear that the President, in addition to stepping up and doing what he does as Commander-in-Chief, demonstrates compassion in these remarks and in his approach to this kind of serious disaster.

'All we’ve seen from Romney and from his surrogates is all kinds of politicising and misdirection and I think the American people in this sort of disastrous moment can really see in bold relief the differences between President Obama and former Governor Romney.'
