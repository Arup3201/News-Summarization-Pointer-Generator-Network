A 54-year-old man was recovered from the Gulf of Mexico after he reportedly fell off a cruise ship on a five-day tour of the area. 

The man, who has not been named, was on the last leg of a five-day cruise around the Gulf of Mexico. The ship, the Carnival Triumph, is due back in Galveston, Texas, today.

A surveillance camera spotted the man fall from the rail into the sea and an immediate search was launched.

Tragic: A 54-year-old passenger, who has not been named, fell from the Carnival Triumph, pictured, on Tuesday night into the Gulf of Mexico

Troubled history: In February 2013, the Carnival Triumph was struck by an engine fire while on a cruise leaving it stranded

Passengers were warned that one of their shipmates had gone overboard on Tuesday evening. 

The ship was off the coast of Mexico at the time of the incident and Mexican authorities recovered a body shortly afterwards. 

The 54-year-old man's remains will be repatriated to the United States following formal identification. 

The company said that the ship was due back in Galveston later today, having been delayed by the incident.

A spokesman confirmed that grief counsellors have been made available for the man's family and any passenger who may be distressed because of the incident.

'Our foremost care and concern is with the loved ones of our guest at this very difficult time,' he said.

In February 2013, the Carnival Triumph suffered an engine fire while it was sailing 150 miles off the coast of Mexico, leaving it without propulsion. 

The ship, which was carrying 3,143 passengers and 1,086 crew, had to be towed to safety. Nobody was injured in the incident.

Attorney Jim Walker is is representing families of people who have fallen overboard on other cruises. He said that the industry must do more to ensure passenger safety.

A 'ship overboard system' could be installed, he said. This would alert the bridge immediately when there is a man overboard, greatly increasing chances of rescue.

He told KHOU.com: 'This type of technology assists the cruise line in realising that a guest has gone overboard such that they can conduct a search and rescue assistance.'

Mr Walker said that 90 per cent of cruise companies do not use this safety equipment.
