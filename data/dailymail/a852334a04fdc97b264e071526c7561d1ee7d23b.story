A tiny monkey is walking on stilts, clad in a red tracksuit and a ghostly doll mask, as cars and motorcycles drive past on a busy road in Surakarta, Indonesia.

Neneng, a long-tailed macaque, is only nine months old but can already put on a show as he plays a toy-guitar, walk on stilts and does a handstand in a red cowboy hat.

With a yank of the chain around his neck, his master Iyayi changes the act to entice those driving past to throw a coin or two at the performing primate, one of thousands on the streets of Indonesia.

The practice of training macaques to become street performers has been a part of the country’s culture for decades.

It has been growing in popularity since the 1980s when it changed from being part of ‘monkey circuses’ entertaining children in the poor neighbourhoods, to move to markets and road-sides.

The practice has become an industry in Indonesia, its centre in a district in East Jakarta known as as Kampung Monyet - Monkey Village - where a majority of the residents are ‘monkey masters’.

Here monkey masters train their carefully selected macaque for months to push trolleys, fetch money and roly-poly in the street for pennies.

The monkeys are often clothed and wear masks made out of the face of a dolls head.

Nothing sensational: Performing monkeys on the side of the road or in markets have become a common sight in the country in the the past few decades

Their cruel training methods include ‘the hanging monkey’ which is designed to wean the monkey off walking on all fours.

The monkey master chains the monkey to the ceiling and ties the monkey’s arms around its back, forcing it to stand on two legs.

This goes on for as long as it takes the monkey to find its balance on its hind legs, only allowing a daily food break before it is strung up again.

Neneng’s monkey master Iyayi bought him for 200,000 rupiah (£13) and spent then trained for three months to perform a variety of tricks.

Neneng is expected to make 50,000 rupiah (£3.20) to 70,000 rupiah (£4.50) per day for his master.

Cruel methods: Training a macaque takes months and often involves punishments and beatings to curb the will of the animal

Popular job: Lack of jobs, poverty and poor conditions in the slums have been blamed for the increasing number of 'monkey masters' on the streets of Indonesia

Livelihood: Neneng cost his owner Iyayi £13 and is expected to make him between £3 and £4.50 a day through his roadside performance

The Jakarta Animal Aid Network (JAAN), a charity that feeds rescued performing monkeys, explains that the conditions in the slums is what keeps this practice going.

‘Poverty drives the handlers to exploit the monkeys in the hope of earning small change,’ the charity writes on its website.

'From the forest they are captured and taken to 'monkey village', where the animals are trained to take part in street performances.’
