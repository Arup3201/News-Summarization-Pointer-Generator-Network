Lined up on stage, they have a combined wealth of almost £1billion.

But these megarich leading ladies of pop banded together on Monday to demand even more money from fans.

Madonna, Beyoncé, Rihanna and Alicia Keys teamed up to convince the world to fork out for a service that lets the public listen to their songs on the internet.

At one point 18 of the biggest names in music took to the stage in New York to launch the enterprise, called Tidal – which guarantees them much bigger payments than rival services.

Material girls: Rihanna, Alicia Keys, Madonna and Beyonce launch the online music service in New York before the backlash began

But it seems their attempts to make waves in the music industry turned into a flood... of complaints.

Despite being backed by showbusiness superstars, Tidal was the most talked about topic in the world on Twitter yesterday, with thousands branding it ‘greedy’, ‘out of touch’, ‘cynical’ and ‘money grabbing’.

Many critics said they felt cheated – thinking the stars had gathered to launch a new charity campaign rather than a project to swell their bank accounts even further.

The music streaming service is the brainchild of rapper Jay Z, 45, who along with his wife Beyoncé, 33, is worth almost $1billion (£676million).

Streaming enables fans to listen to songs or watch music videos online, without having to buy or download them permanently on to their computers.

Such services have vast libraries of songs, with one of the most popular firms – Spotify – boasting more than 30million tracks to listen to. But Spotify and other competitors provide their services for free – offering musicians a nominal amount for including their tracks on their libraries. Many of the world’s leading musicians are now starting to turn against such deals, saying they are not earning enough from them.

US pop star Taylor Swift famously pulled all her music off Spotify last year.

The 25-year-old wrote at the time: ‘Music should not be free, and my prediction is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an album’s price point is. I hope they don’t underestimate themselves or undervalue their art’.

Tidal now offers fans a rival service, providing a huge library of music for users to listen to, but charging a minimum of £9.99 a month. On Monday, almost 20 multi-millionaire artists gathered on stage in the Big Apple to lend their support.

The line-up included rap star Kanye West, 37, Nicki Minaj, 32, and Usher, 36 – along with pop royalty Madonna 56, and Rihanna, 27. British stars Calvin Harris, 31, and Chris Martin, 38, appeared via video link.

The stars also used Twitter to raise the profile of the project using the hashtag TIDALforALL – but faced an immediate backlash online.

One person tweeted: ‘I legit thought #TIDALforALL was some sort of save the world campaign, not a streaming service to make millionaire artists richer.’

Another added: ‘Something very wrong with presenting capitalistic ventures like #TIDALforALL as social justice movements.’

A third wrote: ‘I’m still mad about #TIDALforALL! Those “artists” are filthy, money grabbing, selfish, disgusting human beings! It makes me mad...’ Tidal is a markedly different approach to that taken by some other artists. In 2012, British newcomer Ed Sheeran tweeted: ‘Eternal love for anyone that owns a copy of ‘+’ [the name of his first album], however you got hold of it, legal or illegal, thank you for enjoying it’.

In 2007, the band Radiohead released their album In Rainbows online and allowed fans to pay whatever they wanted for it.

Speaking in New York, singer Alicia Keys said she hoped the Tidal service will ‘forever change the course of music history’, adding: ‘Our intent is to preserve music’s importance in our lives’.
