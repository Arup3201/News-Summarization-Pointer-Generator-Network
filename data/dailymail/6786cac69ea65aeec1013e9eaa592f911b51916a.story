Police have issued a public apology to the gay community 20 years after an infamous raid on a nightclub during which people were detained, strip-searched and humiliated for seven hours.

Victoria Police issued the apology on the eve of the 20th anniversary of the incident at Tasty nightclub in Melbourne on August 7, 1994, a date dubbed a 'dark day' for the local lesbian gay bisexual transgender and intersex (LGBTI) community.

The raid involved police storming the venue on Flinders Lane before searching and detaining 463 clubbers for seven hours.

Officers told the clubbers to put their hands up, calling them 'f.....s', before strip-searching them for drugs - a procedure which included flashlights being shined up their backsides.

Victoria Brown, the bartender at Tasty who was present during the raid, said the event was 'hideous'.

Victoria Brown, the bartender at Tasty who was present during the raid, described the 'hideous' details of the event, which included men's backsides being searched with flashlights

'I was right behind the bar so I could see everything. The police didn't have a clue, they weren't organised at all – they didn't even realise there would be so many women there and they had to send out for more female officers to carry out the searching,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'They made people stand there with their hands on their heads for an extraordinary amount of time - it was torture.

'They went through my bra and my knickers and I said to them 'you can touch my bits but you can't touch my hair!'.

'We didn't know our rights - there was only one boy would talked up and they threw him in the dibby van. They wouldn't even let us go to the toilet, and some of them they wouldn't even let them have water.'

The raid was branded 'extreme and disturbing' by the then Victorian premier Jeff Kennet, according to The Age, and Victoria Police were hit with legal action by at least 250 patrons.

Ms Brown was one of the many people at the raid who received up to $10,000 in compensation.

Gavin Campbell, the former resident DJ and founder of Tasty Nightclub, told Daily Mail Australia that the police apology was so unexpected that it moved him to tears

Tasty Nightclub was famous for its themed parties (pictured) and known as a gay club hotspot : 463 clubbers were illegally stripped searched by police for seven hours on August 7 in 1994

She attributes the win to two factors - the presence of solicitor Gary Singer at the raid, who was also strip searched and subsequently formed a class action against Victoria Police, as well as the photographic evidence of four men with their arms against the wall which was taken without the police's knowledge.

Mr Campbell is has also organised a reunion for the victims of the raid, which is to be held on Saturday August 9

'Court was even worse than the night because all the police were sitting there and snickering and jeering and it was the most intimidated I ever felt in my life,' Ms Brown said.

'They just thought "filthy, dirty, homosexuals - no one will ever believe them".'

Acting chief commissioner Lucinda Nolan from Victoria Police said in a statement on Tuesday: 'The events that took place that night caused distress to people and had a significant impact on the relationship between Victoria Police and the wider LGBTI community.'

'It is therefore appropriate we extend a sincere apology to the community members who were affected by the events on that night and also to the broader LGBTI community for the impact this event has had on our relationship over the past two decades.'

Gavin Campbell, the former resident DJ and founder of Tasty Nightclub, told Daily Mail Australia that the police apology was so unexpected that it moved him to tears.

'They've done nothing in 20 years and it was quite brutal to start with - no one realises what the police were actually like on the night of the event -  It wasn't just a drug bust, it was abuse,' Mr Campbell said.

'The public apology was amazing.When police suddenly apologised it had a big impact and an awful lot of people are so shocked because we weren't asking for one and we weren't expecting one.'

Mr Campbell is the head organiser behind the reunion for the victims of the raid, which is to be held on Saturday August 9 at Poof Doof, a Melbourne club.
