NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has said he believes the owner of the Washington Redskins would consider changing the team's name because it causes offence to Native Americans.

Goodell joined the debate on Sunday during a question-and-answer session with Dallas season ticket-holders before the Cowboys' game against the Redskins.

The commissioner said he grew up in Washington and considered everything about the name to be something that honored the tradition of Native Americans.

'But I think we also have to be sensitive enough to at least listen and try to see what it is we can do if we're insulting any element of our fan base, or non-fan base for that matter,' Goodell said.

'I think Dan Snyder is way down the road on doing that. I'm confident he's listening. I'm confident he feels strongly about the name but also wants to do the right thing.'

The Redskins were playing for the first time since President Barack Obama reignited the debate by saying he would 'think about changing' the name if he were the team's owner.

He said: 'The name is just simply inappropriate. It is offensive to a lot of people.'

Congressman Tom Cole - a Republican - has called it 'offensive.'

The Oneida Indian Nation, which ran a radio advertisement in Dallas to protest the
 name, is also planning to meet with NFL representatives over the
 issue.

A small group of protesters gathered 
near the stadium hours before kickoff carrying signs that read 'Stop 
Perpetuating Racism' and 'Redskins (equals) 81 years racism.'

'I'm
 glad the president took a stand,' said Yolanda Blue Horse, of Dallas, a 
member of the Lakota Nation.

'If Dan Snyder wanted to honor Native 
Americans there's better ways to do that rather than Redskins.'

One
 of the protesters, Juan Mancias, drove from his home in the San Antonio
 area with flag of the American Indian Movement, which began in 1968.

He said he protested at a Cowboys and Redskins game at Texas Stadium in 1997.

Jack Flack, a Redskins fan from Washington who attended the game with friends, said he would change the name to Washington Senators.

'I mean, if the president's weighing in, it's probably time for change,' Flack said.

However, some Cowboys fans saw no reason for change.

'It's a tradition,' said Stephanie Smith of Houston.

'It's how it should be.'

Cowboys owner Jerry Jones backed Snyder during the session with Goodell.

'It would be a real mistake to think that Dan ... in any way has a lack of sensitivity regarding somebody's feelings,' Jones said.

'I can promise you that.'

It was adopted by the football team in 1933 when co-owner George Preston Marshall renamed the Boston Braves the Redskins, and the name followed the team to Washington.

Many U.S. sports teams were named after indigenous peoples but in recent years the names have proved more offensive.
