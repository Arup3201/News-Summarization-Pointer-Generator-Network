It does not get any bigger, better or tougher than playing the All Blacks. It tests every part of your being; physically, mentally, emotionally and, maybe even, spiritually. If you have a weakness they will identify it and exploit it. There are no hiding places. Eat or be eaten.

I loved playing the All Blacks and hated playing the All Blacks in equal measure. I loved it because it was the ultimate challenge and stretched you to be everything you could possibly be. I hated it because they were so good and there was always the chance that you could get an absolute hiding.

I played against the All Blacks more than I did against Australia and South Africa combined just because we always toured there every four years or so. We did this because the likes of Jim Telfer and Ian McGeechan felt it was the best place for Scotland to tour due to the amount we could learn from playing rugby in a country like New Zealand.

A lot of New Zealanders are descended from Scotland, the climate is very similar but, sadly, they have always been slightly better than us at rugby. McGeechan says that he thinks New Zealanders are just Scots that have learnt how to win!

I do know what it feels like to beat the All Blacks though. I was lucky enough to play for a World XV in 1992 to celebrate the New Zealand Rugby Union centenary and we played the All Blacks three times in a week. 

I played in the first test with players like Tim Horan, Jeremy Guscott and some fellow Scots, David Sole, Gavin Hastings and Derek White and we beat the All Blacks 28-14. In fact, we battered them that day and, as it was the first time I had played them, I thought this would continue. 

Scotland recorded a 41-31 win over Argentina last weekend at Murrayfield

Nicol said Scotland will have to take their game up a couple of notches when they play New Zealand

I played them a further six times in my career and it is fair to say they got their revenge as we lost all six games. The sixth turned out to be my last game for Scotland in 2001 and it summed up what it is like to face the All Blacks and the same could happen today.

We played very well for 70 minutes to be only 15-6 down but we had expended so much energy just to be in touch of them that we had nothing left in last 10 minutes and they ran in three tries. 

I was substituted with 10 minutes to go and I could barely put one foot in front of the other I was so tired. I was emptied and had absolutely nothing left to give. But it wasn’t enough, and this is why playing the All Blacks is such a challenge.

The game today will be one of the fastest, hardest games the Scottish players will have ever played. It will be a couple of notches up from last week against Argentina and they will also have to face the Haka!

Nicol said that it was brilliant facing the Haka before playing New Zealand and he loved the tradition

Nicol does not think it gives the All Blacks an unfair advantage and you can not let yourself get intimidated by it

I get asked a lot what was it like to face the Haka. My answer is, it was brilliant. I loved the tradition. I remember seeing it as a kid, trying to copy it and vowing, then, that I would love to face it one day. 

People that say it gives New Zealand an unfair advantage have never played International rugby. If you are intimidated buy a bunch of guys in black shirts singing and dancing in front of you, 60 seconds before you are about to play one of the best teams in the world, you should not be on the pitch in the first place. 

When the TV cameras close in to the faces of, especially, the Maori players with eyes popping and tongues hanging out, it can look intimidating but it should not intimidate the players.

It inspired me and I hope it inspires the Scotland team today to get the first win against the mighty All Blacks.
