It is easy to be dazzled by a Scottish player shining in the brilliant white of Real Madrid. The image could hardly be more romantic for fans dreaming of the national side rising once again.

In that respect, those who saw footage of the UEFA Youth League on Tuesday afternoon would be hoping they caught a glimpse of the future.

Jack Harper produced a fine headed goal as part of a starring role within Madrid’s 2-0 win over Basle in the baby of Europe’s elite competition. 

Remember the name of Jack Harper, the 18-year-old Scot starring for Real Madrid's youth team

It was a performance which showed why the 18-year-old is rated as one of the brightest youth talents at perhaps the world’s most famous club.

He was born in Malaga shortly after dad John and mum Tracey — originally from Barrhead — moved out to Spain. The young Harper’s promise was quickly evident, with Madrid making a move to snatch him from under the noses of Sevilla when he was 13. He currently has three years left on a five-year contract with the Champions League holders.

Despite growing up in far warmer climes, the teenager remains a passionate about the old country and is already integrated within the SFA’s youth structure.

Performance director Mark Wotte has been out to the Spanish capital to visit the Real academy and is in little doubt of the talent Harper possesses.

Yet the Dutchman also urges caution about burdening him with excessive expectation. While the sight of a Scot representing Les Merengues is seductive, Wotte believes Harper is only now reaching the critical stage of his development.

Iker Casillas is said to have lent Harper a helping hand during his formative years at the Bernabeu 

‘People might look at the fact he is playing for Real Madrid and think it his progress is automatic, but that’s not the case,’ Wotte told Sportsmail.

‘There is still a lot of work for Jack to do before he can step up to the Under-21s or even the A squad. He is not there yet.

‘He is in the most important part of his pathway. Between 18 and 20, so many things can go wrong.

‘Do you have an opportunity to play first-team football? Do you have a manager who is brave enough? How do you deal with stronger defenders? How do you cope with everyone expecting you to be fantastic?

‘Jack is definitely very talented and has the right mind-set, very down to earth. Every ingredient is there but he also has to take some really big steps to become the player everyone hopes he might be.

‘This is his last year in youth football with Real Madrid. Probably in the second part of this season, they will decide whether he will go on loan to their B team Castilla or still play for the Under-19s.

‘Jack also has to finish secondary school and take a decision on whether to study or just focus on football.

‘But if you start for Real Madrid Under-19s in an important game, score a goal and have an assist you are not doing too bad, are you?’

Wotte has previously spoken about some similarities between Harper and a teenage Robin van Persie. As well as signifying ability, it is also a note of the hurdles he will have to overcome.

‘I spoke with the people at Real when I was out there and we are not yet sure where Jack’s best position is – is he a No 9 or a No 10?’ said Wotte. 

‘I worked with van Persie (at Feyenoord) and he was a similar style of player – left-footed and long-legged. Sometimes you didn’t see him for 20 minutes then he did something magnificent.

‘The discussion was always about where to put Robin. Eventually he ended up being a top No 9 but there were a lot of seasons when he didn’t fit the system.

‘Don’t get me wrong, I am not saying Jack Harper is going to be the next Robin van Persie. Not at all. But there are similarities in terms of the style and the issues at that age.

‘There are lot of very good things about Jack but there is also a lot he needs to improve on and I’m sure he’s working hard on that.’
