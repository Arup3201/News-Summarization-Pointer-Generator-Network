The British Fashion Council has revealed the shortlist for this year's British Fashion Awards and Cara Delevingne and Victoria Beckham are both in the running for top prizes.

Model-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne will go head to head with Vogue favourite Edie Campbell and Burberry girl Sam Rollinson for Model of the Year, which 21-year-old Cara took home last year.

Victoria Beckham, whose clothing line has been a global hit and was named Designer Brand of the Year at the 2011 British Fashion Awards, is up for not one, but two awards this year.

The 39-year-old designer, who has been working tirelessly on brand Beckham, has been nominated for both the Red Carpet Award and 
Brand of the Year.

The shortlist, which will see Marc 
Jacobs, Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons battle it out for International 
Designer Of The Year, was drawn up by a panel made up of over 200 members of 
the fashion industry.

The Womenswear Designer Of The Year award 
will go to either Christopher Kane, Phoebe Philo or Sarah Burton of 
Alexander McQueen - who famously designed the Duchess of Cambridge's wedding gown.

There are 11 shortlisted categories as well as
the Isabella Blow Award for Fashion Creator, the newly configured Best 
Creative Campaign Award and the British Style Award, which is voted for 
by the public and has been taken home by fashion favourite Alexa Chung for the past three 
years.

Stella McCartney, who took home the Designer of the Year and Designer Brand in 2012 has not been nominated for any awards this time around.

For the first time ever, the British public will have the chance to witness all the fashion action from the front row because a limited number of tickets for the ceremony at the London Colliseum are going on sale.

Tickets for the December 2 event start from £45.

Let the fashion battle commence.
