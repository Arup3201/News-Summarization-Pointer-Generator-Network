Found: An autopsy showed preliminary results that Katelyn Wolfe, who disappeared from her home on June 6, died from asphyxia

Two Indiana men arrested and charged with the murder of a 19-year-old girl, allegedly updated her Facebook status via her cellphone after she died, to hide their actions.

Preliminary autopsy results indicated that Katelyn Wolfe, who disappeared from her Linton, Indiana, home on June 6, died from asphyxia and was found in a pool of water.

Police arrested Jordan Buskirk, 26, and Randall Crosley, 25, from nearby Jasonville and they have been formally charged.

They face charges of conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit rape and criminal confinement, RTV6 ABC reported.

A search began for Wolfe just hours after the cryptic 
Facebook message was posted.

'Her last Facebook post said that she 
was looking to have some fun, she was out walking, and it said that she 
was going to go with these creeps that kept driving by,' said stepmother
Laura Wolfe reported RTV6.

Buskirk and Crosley had allegedly had conversations about 'forcing themselves onto a complete stranger' in the week leading up to Wolfe's murder, according to the probable cause affidavit.

Police were told by Buskirk that he and Crosley had bought handcuffs, condoms, restraint straps, rope and a 20-pound weight, in preparation for a rape and murder.

The probable cause affidavit stated 
that the two men picked up Wolfe at around 1am and drove around doing 
drugs before tying her up with duct tape, strangling her with a rope and
killing her.

It is alleged that the two men then 
put Wolfe in the back of their car, updated her Facebook status and then
threw her in the lake with 20-pound weights strapped to her body.

Linton, Ind., Police Chief Troy Jerrell said the family was able to confirm that the body is Katelyn from a photograph provided by investigators.

He also said the two men are believed to have intentionally killed Wolfe: 'They knew what they were doing all along,' Jerrell told ABC News 
affiliate WRTV in Indianapolis. '

'We don't believe it was an accidental 
type thing.'

He declined to elaborate on what led police to the suspects, who were both being held at the Greene County Jail in Bloomfield.

Katelyn was Facebook friends with one of the suspects - Buskirk, reported WHTR.

His page shows him 
holding a toddler and his last status updates reads 'Watching a true 
original classic... Texas Chainsaw Massacre.'

Crosley's page shows a baby and he posted, 'I am now officially a happily-married man,' in March.
