A couple from California are petitioning Disney to create the first ever special needs princess so that their 15-month-old daughter Delaney - an avid animation fan who suffers from Down syndrome - might have a 'real' role model to look up to someday.

In their petition, which has already gained the support of more than 62,000 people, Keston Ott-Dahl and her partner Andrea pay tribute to the work that Disney has already done in helping children to understand the difference between right and wrong through its popular animated classics.

But they make clear that, in their eyes, the company 'comes up short in one critical area' - the representation of disabled people - and they ask that Disney start taking steps towards changing the lives of special needs children around the world by casting a Down syndrome princess in a future film.

Doing everything for Delaney: Keston (L) and Andrea want Disney to create a 'real' role model for their 15-month-old daughter

Disney's biggest fan: Delaney is an avid animation fan and loves the company's popular princess flick Frozen

'She is excluded': Keston and Andrea want their daughter to be able to relate to the characters in her favourite movies 

'Children with Down syndrome are princes and princesses, too!' Keston writes. 'Disney does a great job of depicting right from wrong. It has long provided wonderful moral lessons that teach our children to be good people - but sadly, the company comes up short in one critical area. 

'Its movies have almost no representation of disabled people, those often bullied and looked down upon by their fellow children. 

'What wonderful lessons of diversity, compassion, and acceptance Disney could teach our kids if they promoted disabled characters as heroes and heroines in their beloved movies!' 

The two women, who foundedThe Delaney Ott-Dahl Foundation, a charity aimed at providing support to families affected by Down syndrome, first began the campaign after Delaney's six-year-old sister Jules questioned whether her younger sibling would ever get the chance to be a real princess.

'My partner Andrea and I are already outspoken parent activists in the Down's syndrome community, but it took my six year old to recognize that her baby sister Delaney and people like her are excluded on even the most elementary level, even as children,' Keston told the Independent. 

'Andrea and I knew we had to do something, not just for Delaney but also for Jules.'

Parental support: The couple's petition has already received more than 62,000 signatures 

Real role models: Delaney's parents want Disney to create films with disabled princesses so that the 15-month-old is able to see that she can be a hero too

Thus far the petition has received an overwhelming amount of support and is just a few signatures shy of the couple's target of 63,000 supporters. 

'We started the Care2 petition with an initial goal of 1,000 signatures,' Keston added. 'We had that in an hour... We had the 10,000 signatures in less than a week.'

The petition has attracted support from around the world, with many offering words of encouragement to the couple. 

'I am so happy to support this cause! I think I would watch the movie a million times!' one anonymous supporter wrote, while another added: 'Children with Down syndrome are beautiful and innocent people who are full of love and affection and would enhance [Disney's] productions.'

And while Keston plans to see the campaign through until the very end - she admits it is only the beginning as far as she and Andrea are concerned. 

'My frying pan is just getting warmed up,' the author wrote on her website. 'I want to do everything in my power to make sure that Delaney knows she is included in society, that she has worth and is amazing.'
