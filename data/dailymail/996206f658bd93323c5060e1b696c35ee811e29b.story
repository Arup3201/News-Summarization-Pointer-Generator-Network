While many of his Real Madrid team-mates were away strutting their stuff during the World Cup, it appears Gareth Bale was busy working hard in the gym.

The Wales midfielder took part in Real's training on Thursday looking rather bulky in comparison to last season. 

Bale had a debut season with Real to remember last term, ending the campaign with silverware as Carlo Ancelotti's side won the Champions League for a record tenth time.

Tough workout: The Real Madrid squad trained hard before the UEFA Super Cup Final against Sevilla next week

As a consequence of Real's success they face Sevilla in the Super Cup Final next week, with the squad training hard for the showpiece event in Cardiff. 

Real boss  Ancelotti kept an eye on proceedings as they prepare for the match with the Andalusian outfit, where Los Blancos could win their first title of the 2014-15 campaign.

Real  defeated their opponents Sevilla twice in La Liga last season. Los Blancos won 2-1 away in March and also thrashed Sevilla 7-3 at the Bernabeu last October.

New signings James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos were put through their paces ahead of the trip to Wales.

Ancelotti will be pleased to have Karim Benzema committing his future to the club by signing a contract extension until 2019.

Speculation regarding the France forward's future in the Spanish capital had been rife in recent weeks, but he will remain at the Bernabeu until 2019.

Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur were among the Premier League sides linked to the 26-year-old this summer but the former Lyon man will remain in Spain.

World player of the year Cristiano Ronaldo remains the key figure at the Bernabeu however, Bale will be the centre of attention next Tuesday during the homecoming trip.

He’s used to holding up the hopes of his nation when playing in Wales but Gareth Bale will return in a Real  shirt to the city where he was born.

Big deal: Rodriguez was signed by Carlo Ancelotti in a £63 million deal from Monaco this summer

In fact Bale’s uncle Chris Pike used to play for Cardiff City at their former ground Ninian Park and Bale used to go and watch from the age of just three.

All is set for a hero’s welcome for Bale in the city where his Mother Debbie still lives and works with just a four mile trip from the stadium to his old primary school.

The Welsh winger scored the crucial goal back in May to secure Real Madrid their precious ‘La Decima’, their tenth Champions League crown.

With his place in Real Madrid history, Bale will continue to create more history in Cardiff, aiming to become the first Welshman to win the Super Cup since three Manchester United players succeeded.

Ryan Giggs, Clayton Blackmore and Mark Hughes, participated in United’s 1991 win over Red Star Belgrade and Bale will hope to follow in their footsteps when he returns to his hometown.

Staying put? Sami Khedira has been heavily linked with a move to Arsenal and Bayern Munich this summer
