It was the book that kept millions of women enthralled, but now the erotic bestseller's Sydney-based publisher is embroiled in a bitter legal dispute for allegedly cutting two women out of a share of the rights to the series worth millions.

Erotic thriller Fifty Shades of Grey made author E.L. James a star as it sold more than 100 million copies, but now two Texas women claim they helped contribute to the books' success and they want their share.

Jennifer Pedroza and Christa Beebe filed a lawsuit in a US county court claiming they were tricked out advances and royalties by their business partner, Australian publisher Amanda Hayward, reported the Sydney Morning Herald.

In a 48-page brief filed to the Tarrant County Court, in Fort Worth, Texas, the women's US attorney Mike Farris alleged 'greed and self-dealing by Amanda Hayward in conning her business partner Jenny Pedroza'Â  and 'fraudulently inducting' both Ms Pedroza and Ms Beebe into employment.

The lawsuit also said it appeared 'that Hayward also defrauded, among others . . . Random House, and E.L. James, author of the 'Fifty Shades' trilogy,' reported courthousenews.com and that 'because of her chicanery, all payments flowed to her'.

The women are now seeking a share of advances and royalties in the dispute, with it believed Random House paid tens of millions for the publish rights to the three books in the Fifty Shades series.

Ms Pedroza of Arlington, Texas, alleges she was a foundation partner with Ms Hayward in The Writers Coffee Shop (TWCS).

Ms Hayward established TWCS in 2009 as a library of free online fan fiction stories where, according to its own website, 'friends meet to discuss books, blogs, serial fiction, news'.

TWCS launched as a virtual publishing company in October 2010, 'with the vision of working alongside talented authors while providing quality e-books to the growing marketplace'.

In May 2011, the company released an e-book and a print on demand paperback of Fifty Shades of Grey.

The lawsuit alleges Ms Hayward subsequently and fraudulently restructured the business under the smokescreen of tax minimisation without without telling her partners.

This restructure is said to have enabled payments from the Random House deal to flow exclusively to here, when the deal was signed in March 2012.

Ms Pedroza claims she only received a one-off payment of $100,000 from the initial Random House advance despite organising speaking engagements, issuing press releases and packing and mailing paperback books for the partnership.

After Ms Hayward allegedly swore on her own daughter's lives she would never terminate Ms Pedroza services, this lead the complainant to sign an individual contractor agreement.

But despite Ms Hayward's promise, Ms Pedroza was sacked in January 2013 and is now seeking monetary relief worth more than $1 million.

Second complainant Christa Beebe become tangled in the dispute when she took an unpaid position to help market and distribute books including the Fifty Shades trilogy in January 2012.

While her role became a salaried position, it is alleged Ms Beebe rejected a teaching job based on Ms Hayward's promises of full time employment, but was also sacked.

The complainants against Ms Hayward allege she has spent some of the money from the deal on her lavish home in Dural, in Sydney's north suburbs

Both women now claim Ms Hayward has spent some of the money from the lucrative Random House deal on a lavish $5 million home featuring pool and tennis court in Dural, in north western Sydney and also gymnastics gym.

The lawyer representing the women, Mike Farris, of Dallas firm Vincent Lopez Serafino Jenevein said his clients argue that Ms Hayward's company, which was set up under Australian law, never owned the publishing rights to the Fifty Shades series.

'I believe that the law, the facts and the equities are in our favour, although I never like to speculate on the outcome of the case. However, I like our chances in front of a jury,' Mr Farris said.

As part of the lawsuit, the court is being asked to accept that The Writers Coffee Shop is an ongoing partnership and, as Ms Pedroza is a partner, she is entitled to 25 per cent of the profits.

The court has temporarily restrained Hayward from collecting any additional proceeds from the books' sales. A hearing date of June 12 has been set down for the women's application for a temporary injunction.

Both women are seeking equitable relief, including injunctive relief, the imposition of a constructive trust, damages, and to trap funds not yet paid by Random House.

Mr Farris does not expect either author E.L. James, a pseudonym for Erika Leonard, or Random House to be required as parties in the law suit.

The claim also raises allegations that Hayward defrauded E.L. James and publishers Random House by signing an agreement with them on behalf of a company that did not own the publishing rights.

The first Fifty Shades book is currently being made into a Hollywood movie.
