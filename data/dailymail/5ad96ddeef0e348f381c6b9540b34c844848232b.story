A married teacher has turned herself into authorities after she allegedly committed a sex act on a student, made out with another and sent explicit photos of herself to a third.

Ashley Parkins Pruitt, a 28-year-old mother of one, was arrested in Blount County, Alabama after turning herself in on Thursday afternoon and has bonded out of the county jail.

Pruitt, an English and physical education teacher at Appalachian High School, is accused of incidents with three different students between August and October, AL.com reported.

Accused: The 28-year-old English teacher and sports coach, who is married (her husband is pictured) with a young son, allegedly carried on the relationships with students between August and October

From August until September, she allegedly kissed a student under the age of 19 in a car in Oneonta and used Snapchat to send him sexually explicit messages, according to court records.

Then in October, she sent photos of her breasts and genitals to a student under the age of 18, again using Snapchat, which deletes messages after they are viewed by the recipient.

She also told the student that she wanted to take his virginity, according to the affidavit.

Also that month, she engaged in oral sex with another victim, who is also under 19, in a car, and used Snapchat to set up the meeting, according to authorities.

Pruitt is charged with two counts of providing pornography to a minor, two counts of sex act with a student, one count of sex contact with a student.

Pruitt was a teacher at Appalachian High School but it is not clear if she is still employed by the district

Pruitt, who is head coach for the junior girls basketball team at Appalachian High School, is married with a young son and lives in Locust Fork.

It is not yet clear whether she remains employed by the school district.

District Attorney Pamela Casey confirmed Pruitt's arrest, but wouldn't comment any further on the investigation.

Authorities have also not revealed if Pruitt taught the students in question or if they attended other schools in Blount County.
