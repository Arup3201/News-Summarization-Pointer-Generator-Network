Joseph Crabtree, 17, is believed to have killed his mother before taking his own life

A shocking mother-son suicide pact in suburban Tulsa, Oklahoma, led a 17-year-old prep school student to shoot dead his 50-year-old parent before turning the gun on himself, police have revealed. 

Detectives say they will never know for certain how Joseph Crabtree and his mother Kimberly died in their home on Tuesday - but there was no sign of forced entry or struggle.

Police believe that Joseph killed his mother and then killed himself. Investigation had led cops to the conclusion that they both were in agreement about their deaths, the Tulsa World reports. 

Joseph had attended the prestigious Cascia Hall Preparatory School, a $11,000-a-year private academy. 

He recently transferred to Bishop Kelley High School, a Catholic high school that charges similar tuition.

Police said they do not know what prompted Joseph and Kimberly Crabtree to decide to end their lives.

In
 2008, Joseph C. Crabtree, Joseph's father and Kimberly's husband, died 
of heart failure at age 52. He ran a massive chain of car dealerships in
 Connecticut until 2007, when his company abruptly closed its doors amid
 allegations of fraud and threats of a criminal investigation by the 
state Attorney General.

An obituary reveals that the elder Crabtree also had another son and a daughter. It is not believed they were home at the time Joseph and Kimberly died.

A relative called police on Tuesday night after she had been unable to reach Kimberly or Joseph and no one answered the door when she went to the home.

Police entered the house in a quiet suburban neighborhood and found the two dead.

'Last night after learning of Joe’s death, many of his former classmates asked to gather at our chapel to support each other in dealing with this tragic loss,' Roger Carter, the headmaster of Cascia Hall, said in a message to parents and students, according to the World.

Reverend Brian O'Brien, the president of Bishop Kelley, called the deaths 'very tragic.'
