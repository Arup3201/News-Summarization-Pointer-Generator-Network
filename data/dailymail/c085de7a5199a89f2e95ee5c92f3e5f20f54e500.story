Mustafa Yussuf, 21, was the first man to attack the woman. He was jailed for seven years for the rape

A woman who was dragged into 
an alleyway and raped after a night out was subjected to a second 
horrifying ordeal by another man as she lay recovering from the attack.

Mustafa Yussuf was the first to prey 
on the woman as she walked through Manchester city centre on New year's Eve, marching her 
into Church Street car park and raping her in a nearby lane.

After the assault the then 20-year-old fled the scene, leaving the woman helpless.

It was then that, instead of assisting her, another man pounced on the woman and raped her.

The distressing details of the double rape emerged as Yussuf, now 21, from Manchester, was jailed for seven years for the attack.

He claimed to have had a consensual encounter with the woman but denied rape.
But a jury at Manchester Crown Court trial rejected his account and found him guilty.

Judge Martin Steiger QC, sentencing, 
said he ‘hadn’t the slightest doubt’ that Yussuf was ‘perfectly aware’ 
the woman was too drunk to consent to any activity.

The court heard that the ‘mature’ woman had drunk to excess because of relationship problems, with CCTV showing she was unable to stand.

She was refused re-entry to the nightclub when she asked to be allowed in to search for her lost handbag.

In the aftermath of the double-rape attack she needed strangers’ help to get home and she was unable to remember what had happened to her for two hours.

Zoe Nield, defending, said: ‘This offence does appear to be an isolated incident - it was out of character for this defendant.’

The victim told court that her life had been shattered by the attack and had been isolated by a fear of going out. 

Judge Steiger said: ‘At some point in the course of her ordeal she was raped by another individual.

‘There was never any charge laid against this defendant [Yussuf] for being party to that incident, which the complainant found in many ways the most traumatic feature of her ordeal.’

Another man was arrested for the second rape but released without charge.
