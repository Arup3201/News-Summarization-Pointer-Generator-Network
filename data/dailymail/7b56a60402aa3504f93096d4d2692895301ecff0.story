Police were probing a link between murder suspect Robert Durst and the cold case of a college student who vanished 44 years ago.

Lynne Schulze, 18, vanished in Middlebury, Vermont in 1971, when Durst, owned a health food store in town called All Good Things.

Real estate scion Durst, who is awaiting extradition to California to face a murder
charge for the 2000 execution-style killing of his friend Susan Berman, was denied bail on Monday in New Orleans. 

'We have been aware of this connection for several years and have been working with various outside agencies as we follow this lead,' police said in a statement, adding they were releasing no further details. 

Vermont police confirmed this week that they were looking into a link between Lynne Schulze, who vanished in Middlebury in 1971 (left) and Robert Durst (pictured last week), who owned a health food store in town at the time 

The missing college student was the latest suspicious case to be linked to Durst who has also been dogged by questions about his first wife's disappearance in New York

Miss Schulze, who was a freshman at Middlebury College, was last across the street from Durst's store and the Vermont bus station around 2pm on December 10, 1971, the Burlington Free Press reported. 

At 12.30pm, she was seen outside All Good Things, eating dried prunes that she had bought inside. 

The Schulze case had been reopened in 1992 but police would not say why.  

Durst was being looked at in connection with five deaths or disappearances. 

Two women disappeared in California, his first wife vanished in New York, another woman went missing in Texas and now the latest, a teen college student in Vermont. 

Durst, who recently featured in the HBO documentary 'The Jinx:
The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst,' must remain in Louisiana
on weapons charges until his next court date on April 2,
Magistrate Judge Harry Cantrell ruled, finding him a likely
flight risk and a potential danger to others.

Durst's lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, did not seek bail but argued
his client's arrest and the search of his hotel room earlier
this month in New Orleans were improper, and that investigators
wrongly interviewed him without counsel present.

Durst's attorneys want to expedite his extradition to Los
Angeles County, where he has been charged with the 2000 murder
of longtime friend Susan Berman and could face the death
penalty.

The HBO documentary broadcast Durst being presented with
evidence his handwriting appeared to match that of Berman's
likely killer.

The 71-year-old Durst's voice was subsequently captured on a
microphone saying that he had 'killed them all.'

Long a suspect in the disappearance of his wife, Kathleen
Durst, in 1982 in New York, Durst was acquitted in the
dismemberment killing of his neighbor in Texas in 2003. 

The final HBO episode aired one day after Durst's arrest at
a New Orleans hotel, where he was staying under an alias and had
over $42,000 in cash, a revolver, marijuana and a latex mask
that could fit over his neck and head with salt and pepper hair, authorities have said.

FBI agents arrested Durst over fears he would flee the
country, the agency has said.

Durst, long estranged from his powerful family with its
major New York real estate holdings, appeared in court on Monday
with his head shaved, revealing a long scar on the right side of
his head.

He was being held in a prison psych ward in New Orleans where officials have deemed him a suicide risk.  

James O'Hern, an investigator for the local district
attorney's office, testified that authorities tracked Durst down
after he placed two calls from a phone at the hotel to the
voicemail on his personal phone.

Also in his room was a scribbled tracking number for a
package that authorities later seized, which contained $117,000,
O'Hern said.

Former Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro,
who reopened an investigation in 2000 into the disappearance of
Durst's wife, was also in court.

Durst's attorney asked her to be removed from the courtroom
as a potential witness. Cantrell allowed Pirro, now a Fox News
host, to stay. 

Murder suspect Robert Durst is seen with a newly-shaved head as he sits in a hearing in this court sketch in New Orleans, Louisiana on Monday. He was charged last week with the first-degree murder of his friend, Susan Berman in 2000
