The woman found dead next to her husband in an Indian hotel had desperately tried to wean him off drugs, her family said last night.

Alex Gaskell, a talented photographer with a first-class degree, had been vehemently against drugs all her life and was seen as the ‘salvation’ of her husband James, they said.

The couple, who married last November, were found dead in a hotel in Agra, surrounded by dozens of packets of sleeping pills, anti-depressants and other strong drugs.

The pair had been visiting the Taj Mahal and Mrs Gaskell, 24, had posted a series of exotic photos of their trip around India on Twitter and Instagram. 

Conversely, her husband had filled his social media sites with boasts of copious drug-taking and recipes for lethal pharmacological concoctions.

His final tweet on Sunday, two days before the bodies were found, spoke of how easy it was to obtain high-strength prescription drugs from Indian doctors.

Mr Gaskell, 27, who had been taking anti-depressants for years to combat mental health problems, wrote: ‘Got prescribed an anti- psychotic as a sleep aid. Some Indian doctors are insane.’

Ish Anand, the doctor who prescribed Mr Gaskell diazepam after being told he was addicted to the pills and needed a repeat prescription, said yesterday: ‘He was very well informed about the medicine and I felt he knew what he was doing.’

The couple both taught languages at Manchester International College and wanted to teach English abroad on a two-year extended-work holiday that was eventually to take them to Indonesia.

Yesterday Mrs Gaskell’s family said her husband’s drug-taking was well known and she had desperately tried to wean him off them.

Her stepfather, Greg Pike, 67, told how she had been seen as her husband’s ‘salvation’ by his own family. He said: ‘James had been taking anti-depressants but it just wasn’t like Alex to do anything like that.

‘She had certainly been quite successful of late in trying to get James off them.

‘James had been taking the anti-depressants for a long time. But he may have done other things and not realised quite what he was taking.’ 

Mr Pike, an architect from Marple Bridge, Cheshire, added: ‘If James had been taking stuff, that’s not what Alex would have done. She had always been anti-drugs.’

India is seen as a honey pot for tourists keen to get their hands of high-strength prescription drugs not normally available in the UK. 

The UN has warned about the rise in prescription drug abuse in India and claimed some medicines could be lethal because they were mixed with dangerous substances.

Mr Gaskell – who also had a first-class degree, in English – and his wife were discovered in their room at the Maya Hotel in Agra, on Tuesday. 

Police believe they died of a drugs overdose. The results of post-mortem examinations and toxicology tests have yet to be released.

Mr Pike added: ‘I’ve spoken to James’s mum and she’s as puzzled as me. We just can’t understand how this has happened. She saw Alex as James’s salvation. It’s a puzzle we are all struggling to understand. It’s maybe something we will never know the answer to.’

Mr Gaskell’s mother, Ann Palmer, who runs a consultancy business in Sevenoaks, Kent, posted a photo of Mr Gaskell kissing his wife on her Facebook page, writing: ‘These are the real Alex and James.’
