Kelly Osbourne has quit Fashion Police - just days after her co-star Giuliana Rancic was forced to apologize over a joke about Disney star Zendaya Coleman.

The lilac-haired star, 30, has been a fixture on the show since 2011.

E! confirmed Kelly's departure on Friday with a statement: 'Kelly Osbourne is departing E!'s Fashion Police to pursue other opportunities, and we would like to thank her for her many contributions to the series over the past five years, during which time the show became a hit with viewers.'

'Kelly threw her under the bus': Access Hollywood host Billy Bush said he 'doubts' things are OK between Kelly Osbourne and Giuliana Rancic. However, a source insisted Kelly's possible departure has nothing to do with the Zendaya row

'Fashion Police will return, as scheduled, on Friday, March 30th at 9:00 p.m. and no decisions have been made on her replacement,' the statement went on to explain.

Earlier that day a source told Daily Mail Online: 'Kelly stayed on the show after the beloved Joan Rivers passed away, but nothing has been the same since.

'The chemistry has not been the same between the hosts since the show came back on air and Kelly knows it's time to move on.'  

Apology: Giuliana Rancic was forced to apologize after joking that Zendaya's dreadlocks at the Oscars would 'smell of patchouli' or 'weed'

Kelly fired back on Twitter after her co-star Giuliana said Zendaya's Oscar dreadlocks looked like they would 'smell of patchouli' or 'weed' on the Academy Awards Fashion Police special on Monday night. 

She raged: 'I DO NOT CONDONE RACISM SO AS A RSULT OF THIS IM SERIOUSLY QUESTIONING STAYING ON THE SHOW[sic].'

However, the source insisted: 'This has nothing to do Giuliana. Zendaya accepted Giuliana's apology and she's already moved on to a new hair style!

'Even Kelly tweeted 'this too shall pass' and was over it.

'Joan was the mama bear, she stopped all the quarrels and held the show together, even when Kelly was being testy.'

When Fashion Police returned on air following Joan's death, Kathy Griffin was at the helm, with stylist Brad Goreski brought on board.

E! execs are now keen to revamp the show before it returns in March.

Kelly's bid to leave comes as her dad, rocker Ozzy Osbourne, waded into the argument with some words of warning for Billy Bush.

After the Access Hollywood host slammed his daughter Kelly and stood up for pal Giuliana, the star fired back on Twitter.

'@BillyBush stop acting like a b****. Act like a man,' Ozzy wrote on Thursday night. 'Lay off Kelly or we'll be going to hospital to get my foot out of your a**. God Bless.'

Billy did not respond directly to the Black Sabbath star's message, but joked about it a few hours later while discussing the viral photo of a dress that some see as white and gold and others see as blue and black.

'Need to book an opthomologist AND a proctologist on @AHLive tomorrow. For #TheDress and Ozzy's foot,' he tweeted.

Contrary to reports, Billy blasted the suggestion that Kelly tried to stop Giuliana from making the comment about Zendaya's hair - and that the segment was taped three times.

As Daily Mail Online has revealed, the joke was actually scripted by Fashion Police writers - and was not off the cuff from Giuliana.

'We'll be going to hospital': Ozzy took to Twitter to fire back at Billy

Seeing the funny side: Billy did not respond directly, but joked about the Black Sabbath frontman's comment a few hours later

The 43-year-old said he spoke to Giuliana directly and that she denied claims it was filmed more than once - as did the show's network E!.

'And the Kelly Osbourne part... that never occurred,' Billy went on, adding that he 'doubts' the two hosts have made amends.

'How could it be good? Kelly Osbourne threw her under the bus, in my opinion,' he said. 

Billy also added: 'Giuliana is taking the hit for this. That joke that Giuliana delivered, it was a written joke. Which means there were a lot of people involved - and nobody saw racism.'

MailOnline revealed that the joke about Zendaya's dreadlocks was scripted, and that Kelly did not speak out against it during filming.  

The following day, she added: 'Im giving everyone involved 24 hours to make it right or the world will hear how I really feel. contactually [sic] Im not allowed to speak!'

'I DID NOT MAKE THE WEED COMENT. I DO NOT CONDONE RACISM SO AS A RSULT OF THIS IM SEREIOULSY QUESTIONONIG [sic] STAYING ON THE SHOW!'

Shortly afterwards, Giuliana apologised on E! News. 'I want to apologise for a comment that I made on last night's Fashion Police about Zendaya's hair,' she said.

'As you know, Fashion Police is a show that pokes fun at celebrities in good spirit, but I do realise that something I said last night did cross the line.'

Sorry: Giuliana issued an apology on E! News on Tuesday, which Zendaya graciously accepted

Threatening to leave: Earlier this week Kelly suggested she would quit the show if Giuliana didn't 'make it right'

'I just want everyone to know that I didn't intend to hurt anybody, but I learned it's not my intent that matters, it's the result. And the result is people are offended, including Zendaya. And that is not OK.' 

Zendaya graciously accepted the apology, saying that she 'appreciates' it and adding that she is 'glad it was a learning experience'.

Kelly then tweeted: 'It takes a strong women to apologize & makes a forgiving women even stronger! #ThisTooShallPass.'

Khloe Kardashian - who reported for E! from the Oscars - is now in talks to join the show, according to Radar.  

Fashion Police, now fronted by Kathy Griffin, is not back on air until March, and  Giuliana is expeted back.

Close friends: Kelly and Zendaya, seen here on February 14 at New York Fashion Week, are good pals
