A substitute teacher at a Chicago school addressed a group of 13-year-olds using the N-word and referring to them as 'slaves'.

Mea Thompson and three of her friends say the teacher at first referred to them as 'African-American', which the girls objected to as they are not of African heritage.

The female teacher then used the N-word, which the group claim she then repeated throughout the class, referring to them as 'slaves'. 

Shocked: Eighth-grade-students Mea Thompson and Zaria Daniel say the substitute teacher called them the N-word during a social studies class at their school in a Chicago suburb

The incident took place at a middle school in Carol Stream, a suburb to Chicago, earlier this week.

Four students, all 13, say they were busy working on a project about the Cold War during a social studies class headed by the teacher.

The students say the teacher approached them and referred to them as ‘African-American’

‘All four of us that were sitting there got offended because none of us are from Africa. I’m Jamaican. So we said, “Can you please not call us that?”’ Mea Thompson told NBC.

‘She continued to call us that and said, “It’s the politically correct term.” Then she said, “Well, back then you guys would be considered the N-word”.’

Following complaints, the substitute teacher was interviewed about the incident and confirmed the girls claims were true

According to Thompson and classmate Zaria Daniel, the teacher used the N-word throughout the class and referred to the group as 'slaves'.

The girls say one student left the classroom in tears.

Following the girls’ complaints, the substitute teacher was interviewed about the incident and confirmed that what the girls claimed was true.

A spokesperson for the school district has said the teacher will not be asked back to the school.

Carol Stream Police also said they are aware of the incident and are investigating.
