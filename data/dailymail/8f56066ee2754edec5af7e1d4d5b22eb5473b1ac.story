Alvaro Medran announced himself to European football by scoring during Real Madrid's 4-0 win against Ludogorets. 

But who is the 20-year-old Spanish midfielder? Sportsmail's resident Spanish expert Pete Jenson takes a look. 

Who is Madrid’s latest start turn?

Alvaro Medran isn't 21 until next March and already he's a Champions League scorer. Born in Cordoba, he was missed by the biggest local club’s scouts but Madrid brought him to the capital.

How long has Ancelotti had his eye on him?

The 20-year-old is congratulated by his Galactico team-mates at the Bernabeu on Tuesday night 

When he was a Real Madrid C player last season Medran was already getting games for the B-team in Spain’s second division.

Last summer he was taken on the pre-season tour, largely because Madrid bulked the squad out with youth-teamers because only 10 senior players were back from World Cup duty. But he impressed enough in training Stateside to debut against Inter Milan in Oakland.

This season he has been a regular for the B-team but has already played 90 minutes in the Spanish Cup for the first time.

What’s his profile?

He has been likened to Isco and can certainly offer plenty going forward as five goals for the B-team show. He can play as a No 10 or in Madrid’s 4-3-3 either side of the central midfielder. He played to the left of Illaramendi in Real Madrid’s second-leg 5-0 cup win over Cornella last week.

Manager Carlo Ancelotti has been keeping a careful eye on the midfielder in recent months 

So there will be no stopping him now?

A Champions League goal doesn’t always make for a Real Madrid career. Roberto Soldado scored in the competition while coming up from the youth team but had to leave the club to make a career for himself. 

But Ancelotti is a big fan of Medran and for as long as the Italian is at the Bernabeu he will have a chance. With James Rodriguez and Luka Modric currently out injured he is closer to the first team than ever. 

He will play out the rest of the season in the B-team if Madrid sign Lucas Silva in January, but he is expected to tour with the first team against next summer.
