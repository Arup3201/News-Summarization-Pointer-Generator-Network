As a lawyer, Clara Vondrich is very used to being in close contact with criminals.

But the 36-year-old from Brooklyn went one step further when she took the law into her own hands - chasing a boy who had stolen her iPhone down the street and capturing him - before holding him in a bear hug and waiting for the police.

Ms Vondrich had been taking a business call outside a coffee shop on South Third Street, Williamsburg, when the 13-year-old boy approached her, along with two others.

Lawyer Clara Vondrich charged down the street after this 13-year-old boy after he stole her phone, before catching him and gripping him in a bear hug until police arrived to arrest him

He shoved her from behind, almost knocking her over, before wrenching her phone from her hand and making off with it.

As soon as Ms Vondrich had realised what had happened, she took action.

Dressed in wedges and a bright summer dress, she tore down the street after the thief.

'I was all disoriented,' she told the New York Post. 'My headphones almost came off.

'I looked up and I saw him running with my phone.

'I was screaming the whole time, "Get that kid!"' she said. 'I finally said, "Yo, I'll give you $200 for that. Just stop".'

Ms Vondrich described the boy as 'pudgy', and was able to catch him even though she was wearing wedges

Hardly dressed for the occasion, Ms Vondrich took the law into her own hands while wearing a summer dress

Not listening, the teenager, who Ms Vondrich described as slow and out-of-shape, handed the phone to his quicker friend, but the lawyer stayed in pursuit of the original thief.

The chase ran over five blocks before she finally caught him on South Sixth Street, before wrapping her arms around his chest in a bear grip and forcing him over a car - in the manner of a police offer.

She kept him pinned down for two minutes before police arrived to handcuff him and take him to the 90th Precinct station house, where he was to be charged with grand larceny.

She had hold of him long enough for dramatic photos to be captured, in which the pair almost look to be posing. 

'He was so pudgy and was slowing down, so that’s why I caught up to him,' said Ms Vondrich, who admitted she even felt sorry for the boy.

Despite her son being the one in the wrong, the boy's mother was angry with Ms Vondrich for catching and bear hugging him, telling The Post: 'She has her hands all over him. Why is she touching him like that?

'He’s a very good boy, he’s just been hanging out with the wrong crowd. I told him he has to stop hanging out with those boys.'

Police were able to track the phone down to a nearby apartment using GPS, but were unable to enter without a search warrant.
