This double-storey residence may look like many other on the market- but number 11 Downs St comes with a coloured history not many houses in Australia can lay claim to.

The Brunswick house in Victoria is the former family home of convicted crime boss Tony Mokbel- and not only does it come with four bedrooms and generous living areas, it also comes with a certain notoriety.

Arguably one of the most infamous men in Australia's gangland wars, Mokbel was extradited from Athens, Greece after fleeing the country in 2006.

In 2012 he was sentenced to 30 years in jail by the Supreme Court of Victoria, where he will remain behind bars for a minimum of 22 years, closing one chapter of the Melbourne gangland wars.

Tony Mokbel's former family home is on the market, asking $1.23 million for the four-bedroom property

The property has been listed by Glenn Barlett of Woodards, with inspection dates organised for Saturday October 18, as well as the following weekend.

The house has been in and out of the news over the past ten years, with it's former next door neighbour, number 9 Downs Street, also owned by Mokbel, which was once home to an amphetamine laboratory 

Mokbel was on trial for importing cocaine, and hid in his home state for eight months before relocating to Western Australian and travelling to Greece, his country of heritage, in a yacht.  

The property was used as surety to gain the  criminal bail in 2006 by his sister-in-law Renate, who later served jail time after she was banned from selling the property by the courts.

Mokbel was been charged with the murder of drug syndicate patriarch Lewis Moran, for which he was acquitted in 2009, and is alleged to have laundered over $2 million through a Melbourne brothel.

Australian authorities also allege that Mokbel was the mastermind behind the Melbourne amphetamines trade, as well as multiple links to the deaths of several victims in the city's gangland war.

The house has been in and out of the news over the past ten years, with it's former next door neighbour, number 9 Downs Street, also owned by Mokbel, which was once home to an amphetamine laboratory, reported The Age.  

After the lab was discovered by police in 1997, the house was blown up in an accident, and was then transformed into an extension of number 11, including a swimming pool, garden area, and side-yard for the already large property. 

Ownership of the house was transferred to the Attorney-General of Victoria in 2009, the government was legally allowed to sell the property.

The residence has been empty for over four years, and is now asking $1.23 million, a rise of $100,000 over the last listed price.

The terracotta forecourt leads down to large bottom-floor living and dining areas, which flow onto a landscaped terrace and another formal living and dining area.

The modern residence boasts an open plan kitchen with granite benches and a suite of in-built appliances.

As well as four generous bedrooms on the second level, a further bedroom or study is joined by a bathroom.

The main bedroom comes with a private balcony and large ensuite, which is highlighted by a third bathroom and a sky lit lounge with another balcony. 

The house comes with ducted heating, ducted vacuum, and double garage for a large family fleet.
