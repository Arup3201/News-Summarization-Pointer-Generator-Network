A body has been found in the hunt for missing student Hannah Graham, the University of Virginia student who went missing more than a month ago.

Officers uncovered human remains in Albermarle County, just south of Charlottesville, where Hannah, 18, went missing. 

The find was made around an abandoned property on a rural road - the area where suspect Jesse Matthew, who has been charged with Hannah's abduction, grew up.

The identity of the remains has not yet been confirmed - but officers have called off all other search efforts for Hannah in the meantime.

Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr, 32, has been arrested charged with abduction with intent to defile. 

The sophomore was last seen on a surveillance video walking with kidnapping suspect Jesse Matthew in downtown mall in Charlottesville, Virginia on September 13. 

He said: 'Sometime before noon today a search team from the Chesterfield County Sheriff's department discovered what appears to be human remains.

'Forensic tests need to be conducted to determine the identity of these remains. But we wanted to be quick in informing the Graham family.

Graham family: Hannah's mother and father (front and back right) had recently released a fresh plea for people to look for her

Plea: Sue and John Graham, pictured in a video statement earlier this month, pleaded with people who live in Charlottesville or another county nearby to check their propery for any signs of their daughter

'Unprecedented': Police officers praised the efforts of searchers, who have been looking for Hannah for the past five weeks

Extensive: Search parties scoured the area around Charlottesville, VA, before finding her around ten miles from where she disappeared

'This investigation is complicated, it's a complex criminal investigation, it is unlikely that we will have any more information in the near future.'

Describing the 'unprecedented' search effort, he said: 'It was 35 days ago since University of Virginia student Hannah Graham disappeared from our downtown pedestrian mall.

He added: 'Thousand of hours have been spent by hundreds of law enforcement and civilian volunteers in an effort to find Hannah.'

It came days after Sue and John Graham, Hannah's parents, issued a last, passionate plea for Virginians to look out for signs of her.

Writing on October 13 - a month after she vanished - they said: 'It is heart-breaking for us that the person or persons who know where Hannah is have not come forward with that information.

'It is within their power both to end this nightmare for all, and to relieve the searchers of their arduous task.'

Last sighting: Hannah, seen left, was spotted with Matthew on the night she disappeared - she is pictured above just before 1am

Emotion: Charlottesville Police Chief Tim Longo is overcome with emotional at a press conference announcing the discovery of human remains

Witnesses have said they saw Matthew with Hannah on the night she disappeared.

The spot at which the human remains were found, on Old Lynchburg Road in Albermarle County, is not far from where Matthew's mother used to live.

He is said to have grown up in the area and to be familiar with it. 

Virginia State Police have said Matthew's arrest provided a 'forensic link' to the 2009 unsolved murder of Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old who also went missing from Charlottesville.

Link: Police have said DNA evidence connects Hannah's disappearance with that of Morgan Harrington, another student in Virginia who went missing

Concert: Morgan, 20, who was at Virginia Tech, disappeared after going to a Metallica concert in 2009

Morgan, a student at Virginia Tech, disappeared on October 17 2009 in Charlottesville. Her body was found only a few miles from where the discovery today was made.

She had been at a Metallica concert in Charlottesville, but was separated from her friends and left outside of the arena. Witnesses saw her trying to hitch-hike home.

Her body was eventually found, more than 100 days after she went missing. Until Matthew was linked to the disappearance, no leads as to who may have taken her had been found. 

Matthew has never been charged in connection with Morgan, but it was recently revealed that police questioned him - but then let him go. 

It is now a month since our precious daughter Hannah disappeared.

We would again like to express our thanks to Chief Longo, Mark Eggeman, their teams, and all of the wonderful people who have dedicated so much of their time to help search for Hannah. Words cannot adequately express our gratitude to them, and to the many others who have provided us with support throughout this ordeal.

We truly appreciate the enormous effort that is being made to find Hannah. It is heart-breaking for us that the person or persons who know where Hannah is have not come forward with that information. It is within their power both to end this nightmare for all, and to relieve the searchers of their arduous task.

Again, we would like to urge anyone who has not already searched their property in the city of Charlottesville, or any of the neighboring counties, to please do so today.

Please, please, please help us to bring Hannah home.

Thank you.

John and Sue Graham
