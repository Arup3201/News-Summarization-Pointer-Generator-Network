'Cocaine habit': An accountant overseeing Scot Young’s bankruptcy said the businessman had a drug problem. Mr Young is pictured with Noelle Reno

The bankrupt tycoon who fell to his death last week was addicted to cocaine, it has been claimed.

Scot Young, 52, a one-time fixer to the super rich, plunged on to railings outside a £3million apartment in London last Monday.

He had been at the centre of a notorious divorce case, with ex-wife Michelle, 50, accusing him of hiding millions from her and their two daughters. It led to his imprisonment for refusing to reveal how much money he was worth.

Yesterday, David Ingram, senior partner at Grant Thornton, who was the accountant overseeing Mr Young’s bankruptcy, said of Mr Young: ‘He said he wanted to enter into an individual voluntary arrangement, whereby he would agree to pay back his creditors an amount he could afford.

‘[But] I don’t think it was a secret that he had his ups and downs. He provided me with letters from doctors and specialists that he was bipolar and he was taking medication for that.

‘He also had a non-prescription drug habit, cocaine. And there were times he came to my office smelling of alcohol.’

Mr Ingram added: ‘He smoked too, he would go outside for a cigarette, for all I know he went outside for a cigarette, if he’d had a few drinks, who knows what happened?

‘He was desperate to get back on his feet and we were trying to work out a plan where he would do that.’

It comes after Mr Young’s ex-fiancée, American Noelle Reno, 32, reportedly told friends she had a furious row with Mr Young on the day of his death after he turned up ‘high’ at their flat. 

Miss Reno and Mr Young, who met in 2008, had separated after a series of rows and she had asked him to move out of the duplex they were renting in Montagu Square, Marylebone.

She is said to have told friends that on the day he died, he turned up at the flat but would not leave so she left and called police. He was, friends said, ‘manic, crazy and probably high’.

She had also reportedly told friends that Mr Young ‘was not in a good place’, had embarrassed her at a number of society events and had at times smelled of alcohol. 

Miss Reno, a star of Bravo's Ladies of London, was however, reluctant to publicise the news of their split because of his fragile mental state - he had already attempted suicide, had been into rehab and been sectioned twice under the Mental Health Act.

Mr Young was once described as billionaire but little is known about how he made - and then lost - his fortune.

Born in Dundee, Mr and Mrs Young met when he was a rising property entrepreneur and she was working in the retail industry. During the course or their marriage he went on to amass a fortune.

The family lived in a £19million home in Egham, Surrey, which Mr Young later sold to billionaire Russian dissident Boris Berezovsky. He also had a £4.5million house in Miami and a series of properties in Mayfair and Knightsbridge worth at least £32million.

His close friends included billionaire entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter, and Topshop boss, Sir Philip Green. The family, who had also had a fleet of cars, were said to only ever travel by private jet. But in 2006 after Mrs Young reportedly round out he had been unfaithful, the couple separated.

A year later, after she had filed for divorce, he claimed to be £27million in debt and insolvent having lost his fortune in a mysterious property deal called, Project Moscow. He was decanted bankrupt in 2010.

Mrs Young has always claimed that he was worth ‘billions’ and that he had gone to great lengths to hide his assets. Last year, the courts found in her favour, and ordered Mr Young to pay £20 million.

Mr Ingram, whose job it is to recover assets for Mr Young’s creditors, said that, as far as he was aware, Mr Young did not have any money when he died.

‘He did find Michelle’s position extremely frustrating,’ he said.

‘We know that he was living on handouts from his friends. He may have done a few deals but her certainly did not seem to be living the lifestyle that he once did. He knew a lot of wealthy individuals who for whatever reason were quite generous.

‘He never particularly articulated what he was going to do [to start making money again]. He was a deal maker, whether that was money laundering or what I don’t know, but he was someone who would set up and put deals together and then take commission.’

Scene: Mr Young died in Marylebone, central London, where police are not saying whether he left a note

Mr Young's body was found by horrified residents in Marylebone on Monday afternoon. He had fallen 60ft onto the iron railings below his flat and police moved quickly to hide the distressing scene from onlookers

Mr Young’s links to Mr Berezovsky, who was found dead at his home last year, and his links to other Russian businessmen have led to speculation he was murdered by gangsters over unpaid debts.

But Mr Ingram dismissed the claims as ‘conspiracy theories’.

‘I would hope for Noelle’s sake and his daughters that this was some sort of tragic accident rather than suicide,’ he said.

‘The danger is that they may then blame their mother, they have already lost their dad.’ Mr Ingram said he was now making attempts, through Mr Young’s solicitors, to establish if he had made a will before he died.

Scotland Yard have said Mr Young’s death is not suspicious. An inquest is due to open in the coming days, although a date has not yet been set.
