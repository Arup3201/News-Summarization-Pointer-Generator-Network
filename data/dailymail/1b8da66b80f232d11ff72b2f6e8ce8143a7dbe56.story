Actor Jeff Goldblum has been hired to promote GE's new bulb - and the result certainly lightens the mood.

The jokey ad sees Goldblum dolled up as a Hugh Hefner-meets-Austin Powers character 'Terry Quattro, Famous Person', claiming all it takes to live a celebrity life is 'good lighting'.

The commercial, promoting GE's new lighbulb Link, features an impeccably quiffed Goldblum painting a self portrait, playing piano in a hot tub and, of course, laughing with two glamorous assistants.

The funny ad has been created by comedians Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim, better known as 'Tim and Eric' - the minds behind Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!, Check it Out With Dr. Steve Brule, and Tom Goes to the Mayor.

Dressed in a silver, rhinestone jacket with his own face on Goldblum asks: 'Question: What does it take to live a life of fame on the big screen, the small screen, even the silkscreen?'

'The answer may surprise you: really great lighting.'

He then goes on to promise 'successful guy lighting to normal guy prices', adding that the annual price of the lighbulb is what he 'spends on moist towelettes every 13 seconds,' before telling a portly man-servant that the serviette is 'too moist'

After showing how he can manage his lighting while painting his self-portrait, working on his signature fragrance and playing the piano in his music room ('which is also the hot tub room'), Goldblum jokes that the bulb costs less that what he 'tips the guys who tips people for me'.

'Silk screen': The 61-year-old can be seen turning around to show his face on the back of his jacket

Goldblum
 shot to fame in the early 1980s after a few years of smaller roles in 
cinema, but he is perhaps best known for his role as Dr Ian Malcolm in 
the Jurassic Park series.

More recently he has appeared in The Grand Budapest Hotel as Kovacs and stars in Johnny Depp's upcoming action comedy Mortdecai.

The
 61-year-old actor is not an unsurprising choice to star in a big-brand 
advertisement, but normally he does not need to be dolled up for the 
job.

In the past he has 
voiced several commercials for Apple products, as well as ads for Toyota
 and Procter & Gamble's facial cream line.
