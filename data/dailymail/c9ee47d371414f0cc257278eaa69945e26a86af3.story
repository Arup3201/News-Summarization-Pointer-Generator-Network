Socialite Carla Powell – confidante to a Who’s Who of celebrities and world politicians – told last night how she was robbed at gunpoint in a terrifying raid at her secluded farmhouse.

The 71-year-old, who counts Tony Blair and David Cameron as friends, was thrown to the floor, pistol-whipped and kicked by a masked gang who ransacked her home in hills outside Rome.

They escaped with thousands of pounds of jewellery, watches and cash after forcing her to open a safe by beating a member of her staff and threatening to kill him. The gang also fired several shots to terrify their victims.

The brutality of the raid has stunned friends of Lady Powell, who for years has presided over the most influential political salons in London and Italy with a stylish and frenetic charm.

Her husband Charles – away at the time of the robbery – was Margaret Thatcher’s right hand man at Downing Street and she became one of the Iron Lady’s closest confidantes.

Recovering at home, she told the Mail: ‘I have never been so scared in my life. I thought they would use the guns on me.’

Her ordeal began in the early hours of Monday when she heard her dogs – who she famously names after her friends – making a commotion.

‘They were outside in the orchard and wouldn’t stop barking…so I went to the door,’ she said. ‘But it was so dark I went to go back inside when two black faces appeared like a nightmare.

'They had black plastic masks on so you couldn’t see their faces and they were wearing gloves. ‘As I was shutting the door they pushed it and I started screaming.

'They pushed me on to the floor and hit me on the back of the head with a pistol to make me shut up. They threatened me saying “if you don’t stop, we will kill you”.’

Lady Powell, who declined hospital treatment for a raised bruise, believed there were four or five men.

She continued: ‘They were young and spoke Italian with a Romanian accent. They had a knife and three guns, one revolver and two handguns.

‘One grabbed me by the wrist by my Cartier watch, which they later took, the other kicked me in the side.’

Her screams alerted her Polish-born farm manager, Dario, whose knee was deliberately dislocated by the intruders to immobilise him. ‘They jumped on him twisting his leg. It disabled him,’ Lady Powell said.

‘I didn’t feel any pain at the time but when they dragged the farm manager from his room and put a knife to his neck, I realised they were serious and knew that I had to cooperate.

‘I thought they would use the guns on me so I opened the safe. They were very professional and went through everything, my sheets, clothes and bags.

‘All my good jewellery was in the safe, even my wedding ring which I wasn’t wearing because of all the work I’ve been doing on the farm. They took a lovely ruby and diamond necklace that I wore to the wedding of the Blairs’ son [Euan] and they ripped the Cartier watch from my wrist.

‘The only thing left is a gold ring that is not valuable but has sentimental value because Lady Thatcher gave it to me as a present.’

But even as she recounted the horror of the night Lady Powell’s thoughts were for her menagerie of animals. ‘At the time Tony Blair, my Alsatian, was so scared he was hiding under my bed,’ she recalled. ‘When they forced me into the bedroom I saw his tail was sticking out.’ 

The Powells’ villa in the Sabine hills has been a refuge for a string of illustrious guests over the years. Once describing herself as Mrs Thatcher’s ‘surrogate wife’, Lady Powell has filled it with political discourse from both the Left and the Right.  

Peter Mandelson, another confidante, once lived in the basement of the Powells’ London home. In Italy, guests have included Mr Cameron, Tony and Cherie Blair, Henry Kissinger, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice and Mikhail Gorbachev.

She has entertained Lord Rothschild, Sean Connery, Stephen Fry and Emma Thompson.

For years keeping open house has been how Italian-born Lady Powell likes it, but the events of the past 48 hours have been shattering for her.

‘Now I have nothing: I am poor like Pope Francis,’ she lamented before adding: ‘I can tell you I’ve never been so frightened in all my life, even during the Thatcher years when Charles was working in Northern Ireland and we were under threat and needed security.

‘I was a strong woman but life will be different now. When the dogs barked last night I thought the gang had come back to kill me.’
