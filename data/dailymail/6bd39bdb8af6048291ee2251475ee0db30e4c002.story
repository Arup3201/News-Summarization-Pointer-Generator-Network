Jose Mourinho  praised the courage of his Chelsea team as the Barclays Premier League leaders came through a feisty game at the Britannia Stadium to beat Stoke City 2-0 on Monday night.

Goals from captain John Terry in the second minute and from Cesc Fabregas with 10 minutes left saw Chelsea give themselves a three-point lead over Manchester City at the top of the table.

Afterwards Mourinho said: 'It is a victory that means a bit more than three points, not just because it is difficult but also to win here you need more than just your quality.

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has praised his side's display following their 2-0 Premier League win at Stoke

'The players were a team, they were together, they coped well with a difficult style.

'Our creative players were not afraid, our defensive players were very solid. Only with a great team performance is it possible to be successful against Stoke.

'To win here you must play a very good game and we did because we adapted well to their style of play.

'When they have the ball, we adapted well. When we have the ball, we try not to lose our identity.

'To score a goal at the beginning is important but not so much at this stadium because the crowd is behind them, they have good players, they have a good bench. It was a very difficult victory.'

Chelsea opened the scoring after their first attack Terry powered in his first league goal for almost two years from a right wing corner.

After that Stoke defender Phil Bardsley may have been sent off for two fouls on Eden Hazard.

Mourinho said: 'From my position and in the flesh, it [the second one] looks for me a red card but I don't know, but what I know is that if it was a bad tackle, it was the only one.

'The game was clean, the game was aggressive but the game was good. My players gave their bodies to the game and I think the kid [Hazard] was fantastic.'

Stoke manager Mark Hughes said he believed Bardsley's approach to the game was honest.

'His tackle may have been mistimed,' Hughes said. 'But I don't think there was any intent.'

Mourinho praised Hazard for putting the ball out of play when Bardsley was subsequently injured later in the game.

'The action shows what the kid is because Bardsley is injured and Eden puts the ball out,' he said. 'I wouldn't do it.'

Hazard left the field after a blow to his Achilles but gestured that he was fine as he left the stadium.
