An 84-year-old nun who broke into a U.S. nuclear facility in an act of protest, now shares a jail cell with 111 other women.

In 2012, Sister Megan Rice, and two other activists from the Plowshares anti-nuclear organisation - Michael Walli, 63, and Gregory Boertje-Obed, 57 - broke into the Y-12 Oak Ridge nuclear facility outside Knoxville, Tennessee.

The group, there to protest against the proliferation of nuclear facilities, first hung large banners on the facility's fence, before using bolt cutters to cut their way inside. Something that took just seven minutes.

Sister Megan was sentenced to 35 months jail for interfering with national security and damaging property and her co-defendants were sentenced to 62 months each; the trio were also ordered to $52,000 in damages

Once inside the trio walked to the building undetected and sprayed quotes from the Bible such as 'Swords into plowshares' and splashed a vial of human blood on the wall. They then banged on the building with hammers and waited to be arrested.

The nun, who spent 40 years teaching in the poorest parts of Africa before returning to the U.S due to Malaria, now resides at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center.

Her cell is a gymnasium-sized dorm with 60 bunkbeds, shared between 111 women. There are six toilet stalls and six showers. In the centre of the room, there is seating for 60 women but no outdoor courtyard or mess hall.

But instead of complaining about the conditions, Sister Megan instead told the New York Daily News of her admiration for her cellmates whose 'patience and endurance' is a 'constant source of admiration and hope'.

The Y-12 Nuclear Facility houses 100,000 tons of highly enriched uranium, which is a bomb-grade explosive

At the age of 82, Sister Megan embarrassed authorities by showing just how easy it was to break into a federal facility undetected. 

The Y-12 Nuclear Facility houses 100,000 tons of highly enriched uranium, which is a bomb-grade explosive. 

If a grapefruit-sized chunk of the uranium was dropped onto another chunk from just six feet, the newspaper reports, that it could cause an explosion at least half the size of Hiroshima. 

Sister Megan told the newspaper that she knew she would be jailed for breaking into the nuclear facility but that she believed it was the responsibility of people without children to take the risks that others can't. 

She said:  'The question - how can we overcome the secrecy and blatant distortion of the truth of the horrific risks to planet Earth's survival as we know it as long as we fail to transform the nuclear weapons and energy industries into possible, life-enhancing alternatives, and begin with dismantlement now? We are all equally responsible to stop known crimes, according to our unique gifts and abilities.'

Other inmates at the federal lock-up where Sister Megan resides include suspected Al Qaeda terrorist Abid Naseer, and Ross Ulbricht, who is alleged to be behind the black market drugs and guns website Silk Road.

Sister Megan is due to be released in November.
