Republicans in the House of Representatives passed a bill Friday that would fund the federal government through the end of December, but at a cost: the entire Affordable Care Act – Obamacare – would be zeroed out of the budget.

The GOP has effectively called the White House's bluff with a 230-189 House vote, setting up a Capitol Hill showdown that the president has said will result in a veto if such legislation should ever reach his desk.

Passing a so-called 'continuing resolution' to keep programs funded past the end of September, however, will put Republicans in a position to claim they took measures to avert a government-wide shutdown. It also puts the ball firmly in Senate Republicans' court.

Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner agreed this week to his caucus' demand to tie defunding Obamacare to any budget vote

All eyes on Ted: Texas Sen. Cruz is seen as the glue holding together any Senate GOP push to force the White House and other Democrats to negotiate

There are just 45 GOP senators, not enough to pass a bill that would defund or delay President Obama's signature health care industry overhaul. But any 41 of them could block the Senate from passing a continuing resolution that's at odds with the House's version.

If conservative Republicans in the Senate, like Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas, can marshal their forces and hold the line against the 52 Democrats and the handful of independents who caucus with them, a stalemate could force those on the political left to negotiate.

Cruz made headlines this week by 
declaring that he would do 'everything and anything possible to defund 
Obamacare' in the Senate.

'The
House has delivered,' Texas Republican Rep. Kevin Brady announced 
Friday. 'Now it's time to fully support our senators as they work to 
unite their colleagues behind defunding this terrible health care 
takeover.'

Hit the road, Jack: Obama has said he will veto any bill that defunds his signature health care overhaul, but his administration may have to negotiate in order to break a Senate logjam

'It only takes 41 of 45 Senate Republicans to hold the line,' Brady added. 'I believe in Senator Ted Cruz and I’m confident he will prevail. It all comes down to the Senate.'

Republicans have taken heat for risking a government shutdown, and the public's mercurial wrath.

They have historically shied away from such threats, fearing a repeat of the 1995 shutdown that the public blamed on them.

But with the growing unpopularity of Obamacare, all bets are off: Americans could just as easily blame the White House and Senate Democrats for being inflexible.

While many in the GOP want Obamacare repealed, others have said they will angle for a one-year delay in its implementation so they can float alternatives and urge the public to rally around them.

'Let's slow down this law,' urged Illinois Rep. Randy Hultgren, 'and look for simpler and smarter healthcare solutions.'

A negotiated settlement that lands on that turf would be palatable to wide swaths of the American public, polls show, since the Obama administration has already granted a one-year hiatus to businesses, and granted numerous outright exemptions to favored political groups.

The GOP's newfound fervor can be traced to tea party rallies like the September 10 'Exempt America' protest on the west lawn of the Capitol

Pressure: Boehner released a video message on Thursday complaining that Obama will negotiate with the Russian president, but not with Republicans

'Big Business, Big Labor and even Members of Congress and their staffs are exempt from Obamacare,' observed Jenny Beth Martin, who leads the Tea Party Nation group of far-right conservatives.

'We are asking that the American people be exempted, too.'

The White House, through its Office of 
Management and Budget, has forecast a bleak future for any funding bill 
that reaches the Oval Office without a provision to fund the Obamacare 
law.

'The Administration strongly opposes' the House bill, OMB said Thursday, 'because
it advances a narrow ideological agenda that threatens our economy and the
interests of the middle class. The Resolution would defund the Affordable Care
Act, denying millions of hard-working middle class families the security of
affordable health coverage.'

Josh Earnest, the White House's principal press deputy, told reporters Friday on Air Force One,  that 'you can expect that the president will have conversations with congressional leaders in the days ahead, but I don’t have any specific meetings to talk to you about right now.'
