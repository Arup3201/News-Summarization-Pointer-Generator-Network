Chelsea Clinton has been dismissed from jury duty in New York after serving for just one day.

The 34-year-old, who was not selected to serve on a trial, was all smiles as she left a Manhattan state courthouse on Tuesday afternoon, wearing a snug t-shirt that revealed her growing baby bump.

The other jurors didn't even know she was among them until her name was called, Pix11 reporter James Ford told Reliable Source. Ford, who was also at the court for jury duty, was the first to reveal the low-key former first daughter was at the courthouse.

'So I'm on jury duty today,& just saw that part of my pool is @ChelseaClinton,' he tweeted to his 2,700 Twitter followers on Tuesday. 'And she seems nice. And she's really pregnant. #BestWishes.'

Other reporters saw the tweet and swarmed the courthouse as Clinton left - but only after she stopped to pose for selfies with her fellow jurors, including Ford.

'#ChelseaClinton was very agreeable about a selfie with me,' he wrote on Instagram beneath their picture. 'She seemed quite nice.'

He also shared a photograph of her leaving the court smiling and dressed in a gray T-shirt, black leggings and black ballet flats.

Ford said the group of 90 had arrived at the courthouse at 9am before being dismissed seven hours later. They were told that they had all been excused for six years.

As she exited the courthouse, the dutiful daughter of the former president and former secretary of state told the waiting reporters that she was happy to be there.

'I think it's important that everyone participate in jury duty, 
just as it's important that people vote and pay their taxes,' she said.

Fellow jurors said that Clinton spent most of the time listening to her iPhone and commended her for her appearance - especially because she's pregnant.

Janice Montague, a juror, told the New York Post: 'I was impressed with the idea that she wasn't excused or exempt. I said if she couldnâ€™t get off we should all be here because she has the pull.'

Her appearance at the court comes just days after Madonna did a brief stint in jury duty at the same place - but with two bodyguards and with much fanfare. She was dismissed after two hours.

Chelsea, 
who married investment banker Marc Mezvinsky in July 2010, revealed they
 were expecting their first child during a New York forum on April 17.

She told guests: 'Marc and I are very excited that we have our first child arriving later this year... I just hope that I will be as good a mom to my child and hopefully children as my mom was to me.'

Her appearance at court came after she revealed she commands as much as $75,000 per speech, just a fraction of the $200,000 her mother, Hillary Clinton, receives to speak.

The family's finances have come under scrutiny after the former secretary of state said during her book tour that the family was 'dead broke' when husband Bill Clinton left the White House in 2001.
