Doctor Who star Matt Smith has sent a heart-warming video to a four-year-old boy with an inoperable brain tumour, telling him: ‘I’m thinking of you, mate’.

Jack Robinson, of Denmead, near Portsmouth, Hampshire - who is a huge fan of the science-fiction TV show - was shown the clip, which includes 31-year-old Smith singing the Doctor Who theme tune.

The actor played the famous Doctor in the series for three years. In the video - filmed in Austin, Texas - Smith slowly focuses the camera on himself before singing the show’s theme tune.

He then tells Jack he will send him some goodies and try to visit him when he flies back to England. In the clip, he says: ‘Jack! Hello, it’s Matt Smith here.

‘Listen, I’m in Austin, Texas, but I wanted to say hello because I hear you’re the biggest fan of Doctor Who, in the whole wide world, and I like Doctor Who fans.

‘I have a friend called Jack, so I like Jacks. So hello, hello, Jack! As I say, I am in Austin and I am sorry I can’t be there to come and say hello.

‘But when I’m back in England, I’m going to try and come and say hello my man, and give you a thumbs up and a “what’s up” - and see what you know about Doctor Who really!

‘But I do hear you are the biggest fan ever, so keep enjoying Doctor Who. I’m going to try and send you some stuff as well. I’m thinking of you, mate.’

Matt Smith

He
 showed signs of feeling sleepy and tired on January 17, and was rushed 
to hospital the following day, where he has stayed since.

A CT scan found a brain tumour and Jack was rushed to Southampton General Hospital to undergo a life-saving operation. He
 had five hours of surgery, where medics were able to remove 40 per cent
 of the tumour.

Following six days of waiting, specialists concluded the
 rest of his tumour was inoperable.

Now he is being treated with chemotherapy
 and radiotherapy to improve his quality of life. Since being diagnosed,
 friends and family have rallied around to make his final wishes come 
true.

This included meeting Take That singer 
Gary Barlow last week. So far, £7,000 has been given to the family, but 
the figure is likely to be higher, as funds are still being collected 
from different events.

Message: Barlow tweeted last week about his delight that Smith had sent a message to Jack Robinson

New Doctor: Filming for series eight began last month, after 10.2million tuned-in on Christmas Day to get their first much-anticipated glimpse of new star Peter Capaldi (pictured)

His father Terry, 47, said: ‘Jack had gone to sleep, but we woke him up to show him the message.

‘His eyes just lit up and he was so delighted - it made his day and he was over the moon. Gary Barlow tweeted he had a message from Matt Smith, but we didn’t expect this - thank you Gary.

‘And thank you to Hollyoaks actor Darren Langford, a well-wisher, who said he had also been in contact with Matt. We’re not sure which person he responded to, but we are grateful that he has.’

Smith was the Doctor from 2010 to 2013. Filming for series eight began last month, after 10.2million tuned-in on Christmas Day to get their first much-anticipated glimpse of new star Peter Capaldi.

It was not immediately clear why Smith - who will star in the film How to Catch a Monster, due out in June - has been in Texas, although he was in Louisiana 10 days ago for the New Orleans Comic Con.

Smith was spotted last week at Stubb's BBQ in Austin by a fan, who posted a photo of him on Twitter.
