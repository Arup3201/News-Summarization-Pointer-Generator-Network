A pensioner has been rescued after spending six days trapped in her bath thanks only her postman who grew worried when she did not answer the door. 

The woman, named Huguette, who lives by herself in the southern French town of Saint-Antoine-de Breuilh in Dordogne, was about to use the toilet when she slipped and fell in her bathtub, according to The Local.

When the woman, who is understood to be in her eighties, found herself unable to extract herself from the tub alone, she reached for her emergency alarm that she had left on the basin.

But she could not reach the device leaving her stuck in the bath with no way of getting out. 

As the days passed, nobody came to her rescue and she was forced to drink water from the tap to survive. 

Postal worker Silvette Villaud delivered her mail after three days, she noticed something strange about the house.  

'I rang the bell but there was no answer. I found it strange because the front door and the window shutters were wide open,' Silvette Villaud told local daily Sud-Ouest. 

Nonetheless her suspicions were not aroused sufficiently to raise the alarm and she went away. But when she returned three days later, she saw the door and windows were still open.

'I said to myself 'That's enough, there's a problem here,' she said. 'I hadn't done that route for very long but I knew an elderly woman lived there, so I went to the Town Hall to alert them.'

Cristian Gallot, mayor of Saint-Antoine-de Breuilh, took it upon himself to investigate the alert and borrowed a spare set of keys from a neighbour. 

Upon entering the home he found Huguette lucid but exhausted. 

'I was shocked by how clear her voice sounded,' he said.

Firemen were called to assist her out of the bathtub upon which the octogenarian asked for nothing but a glass of milk with a teaspoon of sugar.

And she lost none of her sense of humour when discussing the incident with a local magistrate, and told him she had 'learned [her] lesson' about carrying her alarm with her at all times.

'We forget about old people too often,' Villaud added. 'I'm proud I did what I did. Who knows what would've happened otherwise?'
