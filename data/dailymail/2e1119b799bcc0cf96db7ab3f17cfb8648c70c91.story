Six Flags is building what it says is the world's first first 'four-dimensional free fly' roller coaster  at its park in San Antonio, Texas.

Batman: The Ride is set to open in July next year and will spin riders upside down on rotating seats that flip independently of the coaster's direction of travel. 

It will reach speeds of up to 54mph and drop from 105 feet in the air. 

Riders will first be taken up a 105 feet vertical climb before the coaster begins its twisted path down wards.

Fight your fear: The new Batman ride at Six Flags in San Antonia Texas will flip riders upside down in rotating seats as the ride negotiates a series of twists and drops

Thrill ride: The ride is designed to give riders the feeling of weightlessness and is the world's first 'free fly four dimensional' roller coaster

The seats will flip riders upside down six times throughout the ride, as the cars also plunge over beyond vertical drops on a one minute, forty second ride that is sure to require a strong stomach. 

Riders will experience 4G as they are thrown around the coaster's twists and turns in five cars that accommodate eight passengers each. 

The 'free fly' system that flips the seats upside down is designed to give riders the feeling of weightlessness as they are thrown around the track independently of their direction of movement. 

High speed: The roller coaster will reach speeds of up to 54 mph and drop from 105 feet in the air

Don't look down: The ride is the first to combine 'four dimensional' rotating seats and full flips

It is an attraction with similarities to the Green Lantern: First Flight ride at Six Flags: Magic Mountain in California. 

 Park president Martin Bozer told KHOU: 'Every year we continue to provide more and more innovative technology and excitement for our park guests and season pass holders. 

BATMAN: The Ride is an entirely new concept in ride engineering and will provide a sensory experience like no other coaster. 

'The unanticipated tumbling will add even more thrills as riders travel along the dipping and swirling track,'
