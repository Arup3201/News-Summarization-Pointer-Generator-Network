An Oklahoma teenager has died days after his 14-year-old friend accidentally shot him during a hunting trip.

Ryan Self, who turned 16 on Friday as he fought for his life in hospital, was shot in the neck when his unnamed friend tripped and set off his gun on Saturday last week.

The friends had been on a deer hunting trip in Panama at the time of the shooting, which police have ruled an accident.

Ryan's aunt, Regina Hall, told News 9: 'Last Friday, he celebrated his sixteenth
birthday. Didn't celebrate, he was in the hospital ... it just wasn't supposed to happen to him.'

Ryan and his young friend had been walking along a road at about 2pm on November 23 when the younger boy tripped and set off his rifle.

The .243 caliber rifle went off, striking Ryan in the neck, and the teenager was airlifted to hospital.

The teenager spent a week in a Tulsa hospital, but died on Sunday night, more than a week after being injured.

Friends on social media sites suggested he made been making good progress when he unexpectedly fell into a coma.

Ryan, who went to Panama High School, had wanted to be a firefighter when he graduated.

Ms Hall said: 'He liked to hunt [and] he loved helping with the fire department.'

Friends at his school told 5 News it would be hard not having him round for the rest of the academic year.

Grant Ralls, the school's superintendent, said grief counselors were being brought into the school to help friends of the teenager.

The district-attorney will decide if charges will be made against the 14-year-old.
