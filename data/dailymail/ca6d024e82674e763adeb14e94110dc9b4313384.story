A miniature pig has been hogging the limelight after learning how to 'play' the piano.

Thimble, 6, has gained thousands of online fans since she was taught how to play a child's toy piano by her owner Kelly Blackwell, of Florida.

The pet pig waits for her owner's command before standing on her hind legs and bashing the keys with her trotters.

Star: Thimble has gained thousands of fans online with her 'piano-playing' antics

Branching out: Thimble's owner Kelly Blackwell said she was so impressed with how well Thimble took to playing the piano that she has added another string to her bow by teaching her to play the guitar too

She also wears a series of stylish outfits for each performance - from a cute sundress and hat to headbands and sunglasses.

Dog trainer Ms Blackwell said she was so impressed with how well Thimble took to playing the piano that she has added another string to her bow by teaching her to play the guitar too.

Ms Blackwell, who keeps Thimble at her home in New Sonata, Florida said: 'I got Thimble six years ago when I saw an advert for a micropig in a shop window, I'd had a pig before but it grew really big, so liked the idea of one that stayed small.

'My friend was having a charity event so that's when I decided to try to teach Thimble to play the piano, I bought her a small child's keyboard to practice on and she loved it, so I then bought her a child's electric piano.

'When I first taught her she was so good at it I thought I'd get her a guitar and she was good at that too.

'She doesn't play any songs in particular, we like to think she writes her own music, her own form of techno-pop.

Artistic license: Ms Blackwell said Thimble does not play any songs in particular, but 'we like to think she writes her own music, her own form of techno-pop'

'She likes to wear clothes when she's performing and she has a whole load of different dresses, hats, sunglasses. She has more clothes than I do, she loves them.

'There's a shop for dog clothes near to me and I'm a regular there, every time they get something new in they can't wait to show me and Thimble.

'Thimble practices music everyday, I train her using little treats, she likes Cheerios, yoghurt and bananas.

Talented: Ms Blackwell said while she had trained a lot of dogs, she had 'never been able to get them to play a musical instrument, Thimble is smarter than all of them, she is really talented'

'She's been playing for a few years now and she's becoming a hit on YouTube and has lots of fans on her Facebook page. We're just waiting for her to be discovered.

'It's all very tongue in cheek but it's great fun and Thimble seems to really enjoy it.

'I have trained a lot of dogs and never been able to get them to play a musical instrument, Thimble is smarter than all of them, she is really talented.

'She needs to be discovered, I'd love for her to perform on a TV show like America's Got Talent or something like that, I mean it's not like piano playing pigs are a dime a dozen.'
