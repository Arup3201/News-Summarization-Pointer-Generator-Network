It's the most festive drink on the Christmas circuit, but wouldn't leave very many people feeling merry if it always came with a £50 price tag.

But that's what you'll be expected to fork out if you order a glass of mulled wine from the barkeep at Hush in Mayfair, west London, this year.

The Mayfair Mulled Wine, marketed as the world's most expensive, has been crafted by Hush's award-winning mixologist Pedro Solorzano,
and the alcoholic base of this winter special is a 2008 Château Grand Puy 
Ducasse and the prize-winning 18-year-old Dalmore whisky.

The £50 mulled wine is made with the usual spices, plus tonka berries and saffron, which is worth more by weight than gold

Saffron, left, and tonka beans, right, provide some of the depth of flavour in Hush's pricey mulled wine

Along with 
familiar mulling spices such as cloves, bay leaves and cinnamon sticks, 
Solorzano has combined the more exotic luxury flavours of Organic goji 
berries, anisette balls, tonka beans and saffron, which is renowned for 
being worth more than gold.

Finishing the tipple off is a glug of 
organic Sundance apple juice, made fresh from seasonal ingredients 
selected each morning from New Covent Garden Market.

Solorzano said: 'The Château Grand Puy 
Ducasse, 5ème Cru Classé, is 62 per cent cabernet sauvignon, 38 per cent Merlot, which 
make it ideally suited to combine with heady spices such as saffron, 
anisette, Tonka beans, cloves, cinnamon sticks and bay leafs.

'The spices
 help to explore the aromas of the wine and bring out its magnificent 
flavours, while the antioxidants of the Goji berries help to balance the
 acidity from the spices.

'In particular, the perfumed fragrance of the 
tonka beans lends a rich vanilla aroma, which is enhanced by the depth 
of the saffron strands and the liquorish notes of the anisette balls.

'The final touch is the award winning Dalmore 18 years old, which brings a
 special scent and strength to this luxurious concoction.'

The Mayfair mulled wine is being sold at Hush bar in central London and features on their Ski Season menu

The Mayfair Mulled Wine is available now until the 2nd March, and will also feature on the Hush courtyard’s Ski Season menu.

Hush bar is owned by Jamie Barber and co-owned by 
Roger 'James Bond' Moore and Evgeny Lebedev, owner of the Evening 
Standard and the Independent.

 Earle, creator of the award-winning Liz Earle Beauty Co., mother of

writes about the health benefits of red wine and shares her favourite 
recipe for mulled wine:

Liz Earle

'The
 benefits of red wine have been widely publicised in recent years, with 
most scientists agreeing that, when drunk in moderation, it may help 
protect the heart, prevent blood clots and strokes, and even ward off 
certain cancers including colon and prostate.

A
 glass of red wine contains high amounts of natural polyphenols or 
antioxidants which not only help our cells fight against free radical 
damage but also increase our levels of 'good' cholesterol.

'It also 
contains procyanidins which help reduce blood pressure and protect 
against hardening of the arteries. Studies have shown that red wine may 
boost brain power too, especially for older women, although the jury’s 
out as to whether this benefit comes solely from wine or includes other 
alcohol. Don’t forget, it’s only a glass or two that may keep the doctor
 away, not a whole bottle!!

If
 you’re in need of a little seasonal cheer, why not enjoy a glass of 
delicious mulled wine. Adding spices such as cinnamon, cloves and star 
anise also boosts our antioxidant levels. This is my personal favourite 
recipe which will be served to guests at an upcoming candlelit carol 
concert in aid of my charity, LiveTwice.  A heart-healthy winter warmer!

Liz Earle's marvellous mulled wine... and it's GOOD for you

Ingredients:

Use the below as a guideline, but feel free to add your own additional spices such as vanilla and cardamom.

•    2 oranges, organic (or well scrubbed)

•    Peel of 1 lemon (organic, un-waxed or well scrubbed)

•    100g caster sugar

•    A generous pinch of freshly grated nutmeg

•    3 sticks cinnamon

•    6 cloves, plus extra for garnish

•    2 fresh bay leaves

•    2 bottles of fruity inexpensive red wine, preferably organic

•    500 ml water

•    5 star anise

Method:

Peel
 and juice one orange into a large saucepan along with the lemon peel, 
sugar and all the spices apart from the star anise.

Add just enough 
water or a little wine to cover the sugar, then simmer gently until the 
sugar has dissolved. Bring to boil for a few minutes to infuse the 
spices until you have a sticky syrup.

Then add the bottles of wine and 
star anise to the pan and heat gently until warm. Be careful not to let 
the mulled wine boil at this stage otherwise the alcohol will burn off, 
together with many of the healthy benefits of red wine!

Ladle into 
glasses and decorate with a wedge of orange (studded with a few extra 
cloves if you wish).

To make a less alcoholic version, simply add a 
little more orange juice and water. For a non-alcoholic version, replace
 the red wine with cranberry juice.
