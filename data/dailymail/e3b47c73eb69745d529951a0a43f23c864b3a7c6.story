Questioned: Notts County striker Lee Hughes has been arrested on suspicion of sexual assault

A professional footballer has been arrested on suspicion of sexual assault.

Notts County striker Lee Hughes was held after police were called to the team's hotel in Croydon, south London, on Saturday night.

The 35-year-old League One star was taken into custody following the alleged incident involving a woman the night before his team's FA cup fixture against Sutton United.

A female party-goer accused him of putting his hand up her dress.

He was later released on bail.

Footballers and people attending several Christmas parties had to be evacuated from the Aerodrome Hotel after the fire alarm went off, the Sun said.

One bystander told the newspaper: ‘There were some Notts County players and a couple of them were trying to talk to women. The next thing this woman started screaming.’

The bystander said police spoke to Hughes in the hotel foyer and he seemed ‘quite irate’ as did his manager Martin Allen before he was taken to a police station.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 
'Police were called at approximately 11.10pm on Saturday December 3 to a
hotel in Purley Way, Croydon, following an allegation of sexual 
assault.

'A man, aged 35, was arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and taken into custody at a south London police station.

'He was subsequently bailed to a date in late January pending further investigation by officers from Croydon borough.'

Notts County said it was aware that an allegation had been made.

The club said in a statement: 'Notts County can confirm that the club are aware of an alleged incident involving one of our players at the team's hotel on Saturday, December 3.

'As this is a police matter, the club will be making no further comment on this incident.'

Hughes, who has played for Notts County since 2009 after leaving Oldham
Athletic, had his contract at the club extended in October by another 
18 months.
