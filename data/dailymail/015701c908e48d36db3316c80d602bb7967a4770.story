Arsenal will ramp up their search for a new central defender during a scouting meeting next week.

The Gunners are committed to bolstering their defensive options in January as fears grow over the lack of quality cover in the heart of their back four.

Gunners spies have been identifying targets for several months, with their findings due to be discussed in the coming days.

Arsenal want a clear strategy in place in their attempts to land a new defender when the January window opens.

Renewed moves for Celtic’s Virgil van Dijk, Aston Villa skipper Ron Vlaar and Manchester United central defender Chris Smalling will be weighed up.

All three interested Arsene Wenger during the final days of the transfer window following the departure of Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona.

Vlaar, who is also on Manchester United’s radar, could be available in a cut-price deal with his current contract due to expire at the end of the season.

Arsenal tested the water with a £7million swoop for Van Dijk on transfer deadline day, while Arsenal wanted to take Smalling as part of a United’s failed move for Vermaelen.

Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker are the club’s only two senior central defenders following Vermaelen’s exit.

But Koscielny’s achilles injury has seen left-back Nacho Monreal play as a makeshift central defender in recent weeks.

Tuesday’s Champions League capitulation against Anderlecht underlined the club’s need to reinforce their defence in January, but Wenger, who has been criticised for his failure to replace Vermaelen, will look to solve the problem in the next transfer window.

Arsenal will also be in the market for a defensive central midfielder in January.

Paris St Germain teenager Adrien Rabiot is on the club’s hit list - but there is a belief among some at Arsenal that they need the finished article in that position.

They are also keeping tabs on Sporting Lisbon’s William Carvalho, but his £37million release clause is a stumbling block.
