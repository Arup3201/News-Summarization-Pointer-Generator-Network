NASA is hoping that their red planet rovers won’t roll over in the face of a massive dust storm.

The space agency is tracking a regional storm on Mars, but says it has so far not affected the operations of Curiosity and Opportunity - its two rovers on the surface.

The storm raging in the planet’s southern hemisphere was spotted earlier this month by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter circling high above the planet.

The storm came within 840 miles of Opportunity's location.

On the opposite side of the red planet, a weather station aboard NASA's newest rover, Curiosity, detected changes in air pressure and overnight temperature related to the storm.

Scientists want to learn more about Martian dust storms, including why some morph into storms that can blanket the entire planet.

Rich Zurek, chief Mars scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, said in a statement: 'This is now a regional dust storm.

'It has covered a fairly extensive region with its dust haze, and it is in a part of the planet where some regional storms in the past have grown into global dust hazes.'

Discoveries: News of the dust storm comes after the Curiosity rover made a major discovery on the red planet - but scientists are keeping quiet about what it is

Signs of life? Curiosity is capable of identifying organic compounds - carbon containing substances that could indicate life on Mars

He added: 'For the first time since the 
Viking missions of the 1970s, we are studying a regional dust storm both
from orbit and with a weather station on the surface.'

In 2001, a dust storm appeared to engulf Mars before dissipating about two months later.

If this latest storm turns into a global one, the solar-powered Opportunity would see an energy decline. 

Curiosity, which is powered by plutonium, won't be as directly affected.

News of the dust storm comes after the Curiosity rover made a major discovery on the Red Planet - but scientists are
keeping quiet about what it is.

Mystery: In 2001, a dust storm captured by the Hubble Space Telescope appeared to engulf Mars before dissipating about two months later

The
finding was made by the six-wheeled rover's Sample Analysis at Mars 
(SAM) instrument in the Rocknest area of the Gale Crate, close to where 
the rover touched down.

SAM 
is Curiosity's on-board chemistry lab and is able to take a sample of 
Martian rock, soil or air and find out what it is made of.

Most importantly, it is capable of identifying organic compounds - carbon containing substances that could indicate life.

Except scientists are refusing to reveal its latest finding, merely saying that it is earthshaking.
