A successful solicitor accused of assaulting his wife and racially abusing her celebrity fitness trainer lover went on trial yesterday.

Alexander Hutcheon, 58, allegedly assaulted Nicola Hutcheon by poking her in the face with his finger at their luxury home in the west end of Aberdeen.

He is further accused of shouting and swearing at her partner Steve Agyei, the former fitness instructor of Cherie Blair, and of making racist remarks in a city bar.

Mr Hutcheon, the owner of one of Aberdeen’s leading property and mortgaging businesses, went on trial at the city’s sheriff court.

Giving evidence, Mr Agyei, 49, said he was sitting in the bar having a drink with Mrs Hutcheon when Mr Hutcheon and his 14-year-old son approached them on January 29.

The self-employed fitness instructor claimed the solicitor spoke softly in his ear and called him a ‘monkey, darky and stalker’.

Mr Agyei told the court: ‘He started saying “tink” and that really stuck in my head. It’s the first time I’ve ever been called a gypsy in my life. It really stuck in.’

He told the court that Mr Hutcheon then asked his wife how she could be with someone like him: ‘She said something like that she wanted to be with me.’

The trainer said he was not intimidated by Hutcheon, of Rubislaw Den South, because he was physically stronger and the solicitor was a lot older and shorter than him, but Hutcheon was acting in a threatening manner.

Mr Agyei 
said he met Mrs Hutcheon when she was on a night out in a west end hotel
 last May. A week later she said was separating from her husband and 
they got together soon afterwards.

Defence
 lawyer George Mathers accused him of setting out to destroy his client 
after he had seduced the wealthy woman, adding: ‘Financially, you’re not
 well off – I don’t wish to be insulting.’

Mr
 Agyei replied: ‘At this present time I would agree with you. I don’t 
need any money from any woman, that’s not the way I’ve been brought up. I
 would never live off a woman.’

The fitness trainer said he was with the woman of his dreams and had plans to make his own money.

Mrs Hutcheon had been pregnant with his baby, but she miscarried and they lost their child.

He said he had consulted with a solicitor and talked about the case with Cherie Blair.

‘I was personal training her when I was down in London, so I was discussing what was happening in my life,’ he said.

Earlier, the court heard from Adrian Hutcheon, the couple’s eldest child, who told the court that his father had taken him down to the Noose and Monkey pub to see his mother.

The 14-year-old said his father had been contacted by a friend to let him know his wife was in the bar with the fitness instructor on January 29.

He said Hutcheon was taking him down to the pub because his mother had promised to live with her family and be faithful and get their lives back on track.

The third-year pupil said he could not remember what his father said to the couple but insisted he had not said anything racist.

The court heard he left with his father a short while later and Mrs Hutcheon did not go home with them.

The teenager said that his mother left for days at a time but would come home for a while, and went on family holidays abroad with them.

He said that she came home on March 27 when his father and siblings were in their beds and started raising her voice at his father.

He told the court he went upstairs to a room on the top floor and saw his father pointing his finger at his mother as he spoke.

She appeared to almost dive towards Hutcheon and, as she did so, her husband’s finger made  contact with her lip.

‘I was confused,’ said the schoolboy.

‘Why did she move her head forward and make contact? I just didn’t understand what she was doing.’

Hutcheon denies all charges. The trial continues later this year.
