'Grave errors': Danielle Canarelli, 58, was handed a one-year suspended prison sentence for failing to recognise that her paranoid schizophrenic patient Joël Gaillard posed a public risk

A French psychiatrist has been convicted of manslaughter six years after one of her patients hacked an elderly man to death.

Danielle Canarelli, 58, was handed a one-year suspended prison sentence for her 'grave error' in failing to recognise that her paranoid schizophrenic patient Joël Gaillard posed a public risk.

The doctor, who has over 30 years of experience and currently works at Marseille's Edouard-Toulouse hospital, was also ordered to pay 8,500 euros to the victim's children, in the groundbreaking case that could affect the way patients are treated.

Gaillard hacked to death 80-year-old 
Germain Trabuc with an axe in March 2004 in Gap, in the Alps region of 
southeastern France, 20 days after fleeing a consultation with Canarelli
at Marseilles's Edouard Toulouse hospital.

'If
a psychiatrist lives in fear of being sentenced, it will have very real
consequences and probably lead to harsher treatment of patients,' said 
Canarelli's lawyer, Sylvain Pontier.

The
court said Canarelli should have requested Gaillard be placed in a 
specialized medical unit or referred him to another medical team, as one
of her colleagues suggested. Her stubborn refusal had equated to a form
of "blindness", the court president Fabrice Castoldi said.

Gaillard had already been forcibly 
committed to a secure hospital on several occasions for a series of 
increasingly dangerous incidents.

The victim's son, Michel Trabuc, said he hoped the case would set a legal precedent.

'There's
no such thing as zero risk, but I hope this will move psychiatry 
forward and, above all, that it will never happen again,' he said.

Gaillard was not held responsible for his actions and was freed under medical supervision.
