A woman who killed her co-worker in 
a Lululemon yoga clothing shop has been convicted of 
first-degree murder and now faces the prospect of spending the rest of her life behind bars.

Brittany Norwood, 29, used at least half a dozen weapons from inside the store to kill Jayna Murray, 30, in a 'prolonged and brutal attack' on March 11.

These included a hammer, wrench, knife and peg used to hold up a mannequin.

Norwood was yesterday found guilty after a jury in Montgomery County, Maryland, took an hour to reach a verdict.

Norwood attacked Miss Murray inside the Lululemon Athletica shop in Bethesda, Maryland - a Washington, DC suburb - and then staged a robbery.

She used numerous weapons to kill her, then lied 
and told police that they had been attacked by masked men.

Her defence lawyer conceded that Norwood killed Miss Murray, but said it happened during a fight and wasn't premeditated.

A judge's ruling prevented both sides from discussing the fight, but prosecutors have previously said it began after suspected stolen merchandise was found during a search of Norwood's bag.

Weapon: Part of a metal merchandise rack that was one of at least six weapons used to murder Miss Murray. Norwood is said to have beaten her colleague over the head with it for around 15 minutes

Tragic end: Jayna Murray was bludgeoned to death after confronting Norwood about stealing a pair of pants

Mother: Phyllis Murray is comforted by a woman wearing a pin of her daughter, at security while waiting to re-enter the trial of Brittany Norwood

The legal argument was aimed at sparing 
Norwood a first-degree murder conviction, which can carry a sentence of 
life in prison without parole.

Murray allegedly found a pair of pants in Norwood's purse at the end of the work day, when they did mutual bag checks, as per store policy.

Norwood initially said she'd bought them from another employee, but Murray called the other employee, they denied it, and Murray confront Norwood for stealing.

Miss Murray's family choked back tears as 
the verdict was read and a 'yes' sounded from their side of the 
courtroom. Norwood and her family sat impassively and declined to 
comment afterwards.

Norwood's attorney Doug Wood said she was disappointed at the speed of the verdict.

She said: 'I think that we were surprised that 
this happened so quick. I thought we had established a pretty good case 
for second-degree murder.'

Mr Wood said he expects to appeal the verdict and will argue against a life-without-parole
sentence that prosecutors are seeking. Sentencing is set for January 
27.

State's Attorney John McCarthy told jurors during closing arguments that there was abundant evidence of premeditation.

He said Norwood lured Miss Murray back to 
the shop after closing by saying she had forgotten her wallet and 
needed to get back inside.

A medical examiner, Mary Ripple, 
testified that she found at least 331 wounds on Murray's body and that 
the woman was alive for the duration of the attack.

Juror Donny Knepper, 36, said the 
panel was essentially convinced from the start of deliberations. He said
he was swayed by the sheer number of wounds.

He said: 'There's no (rational) argument that this was anything other than first-degree murder, and we tried.'
