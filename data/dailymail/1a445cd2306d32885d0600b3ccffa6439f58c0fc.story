What do you get if you cross Siri with Teddy Ruxpin? A cuddly smart toy called WikiBear capable of answering questions, starting conversations and even telling jokes.

The teddy - which resembles the talking bear Ted from the 2012 film of the same name - is fitted with a Bluetooth receiver and connects to the web via a smartphone app.

A prototype was recently displayed at the 2014 Toy Fair in New York and a finished model is expected to go on sale from June.

British inventors Ashley Conlan and Karsten Flügge recently created a talking teddy called Supertoy Teddy.

It can read stories, play songs and answer questions by going online to find the answer.

The £39 toy raised £19,000 in just six days via the Kickstarter crowdfunding site last year.

Conlan and Flügge recently signed a licensing deal with Commonwealth Toys and Novelty - the team behind WikiBear. 

Prices have not been announced.

WikiBear was created by Alec Kessler's firm Commonwealth Toys and Novelty based in New York.

It comes with a built-in microphone and speaker.

When the bear is asked a question, it connects to the smartphone app via Bluetooth and searches Wikipedia, as well as other sites, for the answer.

The computer inside WIkiBear works in a similar way to the Siri personal assistant found on Apple phones and tablets.

WikiBear also resembles Ted, pictured, from the 2012 film of the same name voiced by Seth MacFarlane

As well as answering questions, WikiBear can interact with people by telling jokes and has been designed to talk to people as naturally as possible.

By disabling Bluetooth, the bear shuts down and becomes a regular soft toy.

WikiBear connects to the web in real-time meaning it's software is constantly updated, unlike its predecessor Teddy Ruxpin - a bestselling story-telling toy sold by Hasbro during the mid-1980s.

Executive vice president of Commonwealth, Alec Kessler told Popular Science the demo version of WikiBear will be improved before it goes on sale in the U.S. later this year to make it more responsive.
