Israel today freed 26 Palestinian prisoners as part of US-brokered peace efforts.

But it said it was pressing on with plans to build more homes for Jewish settlers, in an apparent move to appease hardliners.

The inmates, who were convicted of killing Israelis, basked in a hero's welcome from hundreds of relatives and well-wishers in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

Brokered release: Just after midnight, Israel released 26 prisoners - the second of four groups to be set free as part of a US-backed amnesty to resume peace talks

'Our heroes are coming home, long live 
the prisoners,' crowds chanted outside the office of Palestinian 
President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank city of Ramallah.

Issa Abed Rabbo, convicted of murdering two Israeli hikers in 1984, was carried through the alleys of the Biblical town of Bethlehem on the shoulders of cheering Palestinians as fireworks went off and patriotic songs blared.

'My feeling is that of a commander returning from battle, carrying a banner of victory and freedom,' Abed Rabbo said, his outstretched fingers forming a triumphant V.

The inmates were jailed before or just after the first Israeli-Palestinian interim peace deals were signed 20 years ago.

The inmates were released in the West Bank town of Ramallah. They were the second of four groups of prisoners to be set free to enable Israeli-Palestinian peace talks to resume

Peace negotiations between Israel and Palestinians fell apart in 2008. The Palestinians refused to continue talks while Israel pushed ahead with building settlements on its territory

US Secretary of State John Kerry helped the two sides reach an agreement to bring them back to the negotiating table

Their release just after midnight Tuesday was the second of four prisoner releases meant to restart Israeli-Palestinian talks in an effort to reach a final agreement between the two sides.

The Palestinians had long refused to resume peace negotiations with Israel unless it ends construction in territories that Palestinians seek for their state. Israel refused, insisting that settlements and other core issues, including security, should be resolved through negotiations.

The prisoner release was part of an agreement brokered by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, which brought Israel and the Palestinians back to the negotiating table after a five-year hiatus. The talks had been paralyzed since 2008.

Earlier this year, Kerry managed to persuade Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to drop the settlement issue as a condition for restarting negotiations. In exchange, Israel agreed to the prisoner release.

The amnesty involved releasing all of the Palestinian prisoners in return for dropping the issue of settlements

In total, Israel has agreed to release 104 Palestinian inmates as part of the amnesty

In all, 104 Palestinian convicts are to be released in four rounds over the coming months.

The east Jerusalem construction move angered the Palestinians but it was not immediately clear if it would directly impact the talks, which are taking place behind closed doors and away from the public eye, which both sides had agreed to.

Nabil Abu Rdeneh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the move, saying that 'it is destructive to the peace efforts and will only lead to more tensions.'

Last night's prisoner release opened fissures in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's rightist government. A pro-settler coalition partner, the Jewish Home party, and members of his own Likud, called on the leader to cancel the amnesty.

Israel's Interior Ministry said it would push ahead with plans to build 1,500 homes for settlers on land in the West Bank close to Jerusalem

Last night's prisoners were the second of four groups to be set free as part of the agreement brokered by the US to bring the two sides back to negotiations

Meanwhile, Israel's Interior Ministry announced it would proceed with a plan for 1,500 new housing units in Ramat Shlomo, a settlement in an area of the occupied West Bank that Israel considers part of Jerusalem.

Those plans were first announced in 2010, clouding a visit to Israel at the time by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, who condemned the project, which was subsequently shelved.

Israel announced last December it would proceed with the construction but froze the move again ahead of a visit by U.S. President Barack Obama in March this year.

The Palestinians, who want to establish a state in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza, territories captured by Israel in a 1967 war, condemned the move.

Most countries deem Israeli settlements, built on occupied land, as illegal, and Palestinians say the enclave could deny them a viable state

Israel says the area for its settlements, Ramat Shlomo, as part of its Jerusalem municipality will remain in its hands in any future peace deal

'This policy is destructive for the peace process,' said Nabil Abu Rdeineh, a spokesman for Abbas.

Most countries deem Israeli settlements, built on occupied land, as illegal, and Palestinians say the enclave could deny them a viable state. Israel says Ramat Shlomo, as part of its Jerusalem municipality, will remain in its hands in any future peace deal.

Outside Israel's Ofer prison in the West Bank, where the inmates boarded buses for home, dozens of Israelis protested against the release. One held a sign with the photographs of some of the Israelis they killed.

'The victims of terror are turning they (sic) graves,' one placard read.

Yuval Steinitz, Israel's strategic affairs minister and a Likud member, made clear in a radio interview yesterday that by agreeing to the prisoner releases, the government effectively had quashed a Palestinian demand to halt settlement building.

But at the celebrations in Ramallah, Abbas denied any connection between the prisoner release and settlement expansion.

'The settlements are void, void, void,' he told the crowd.
