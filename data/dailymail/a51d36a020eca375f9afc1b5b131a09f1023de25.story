Loic Remy's £8.5 million move to Liverpool dramatically collapsed on Sunday after he failed a medical.

The France forward had flown out to Boston earlier this week after Liverpool had met the release clause in his contract and he had agreed personal terms and a long-term contract before beginning his fitness assessment.

Given Liverpool, who also completed a £20million deal for Dejan Lovren on Sunday, have been based in unfamiliar surrounds, the medical had taken longer than normal to conduct but when the results came back, Liverpool decided they had no other option but to pull the plug on the move.

Liverpool have declined to comment on the specific reason they have withdrawn from the move but it is understood that the 27-year-old, who has a historical heart condition, is devastated his dream move to Anfield has fallen through.

Manager Brendan Rodgers confirmed the deal was off after Liverpool beat Greek champions Olympiacos 1-0 in the International Champions Cup in Chicago.

He said: ‘It's very simple we have made a decision as a club not to go ahead with the deal. It's unfortunate for the player. We are disappointed for the player but there’s nothing more to be said and we will move on and look at other targets.’

Having sold Luis Suarez to Barcelona, they must now decide whether they look for another forward as Daniel Sturridge and Rickie Lambert are the only senior strikers. They are in the process of sealing a £10million deal for Divock Origi but the Belgium forward will be loaned back to Lille next year.

Liverpool have spent close to £100million this summer yet they have funds available. Manager Brendan Rodgers, however, will not make a decision in haste, preferring instead to consider his options. He may even wait until the winter transfer window to sign a striker.

Rodgers said: ‘There is money to spend, no question, but I won’t spend it for the sake of it. It has to be the right type. If that means I have to wait until January then that’s what I will do. The players at the moment are in great condition, they are working very well and very hard.

‘I have seen the development in some of the young players but if the right ones become available we would like to do something because i still have a lot to do on that front – but if they’re not available, I will wait.’

It is the second blow for Rodgers in the space of 48 hours after he lost Adam Lallana, his £23.6million signing from Southampton, for six week after he damaged his lateral collateral knee ligaments in training.

Rather than flying back to England, Lallana – who does not need surgery – will stay with Liverpool’s squad for the remainder of their US tour in order to get to know his new team-mates but there is no disputing his frustration. Still, Rodgers feels it will not impact on Liverpool too severely.

‘Last year if someone like Adam had gone down it would have really hurt us,’ Rodgers said. ‘It’s unfortunate for him but thankfully at this stage of the season, where he has got a good level of fitness, which means he can recover quicker.

‘He won’t be too far away after the start of the season, which is great news. This year is vital for us. You’re going to pick up injuries and we need to have the players who can step in and that’s what we are trying to build.’

There was, at least, something positive for Rodgers with the news that his pursuit of Lovren has reached a successful conclusion. The Croatia international has signed a long-term deal and will link up with Liverpool in either New York or Charlotte, their next stops on this American tour.

Lovren, who has become the most expensive defender in Liverpool’s history, described the move as a “dream come true” and Rodgers believes he has the type of characteristics that will enable his side to vastly improve on the 51 goals they conceded last season in the Barclays Premier League.

The manager believes Lovren can fill the void left in the back four that has been there since Jamie Carragher retired in 2013.

Rodgers said: ‘He's right footed so he can play on the right but he prefers to play on the left. It will depend what needs must. The Important thing is that we have got the player and we will use him where we feel he needs to be. He’s a player who can still improve.

‘I think Dejan is a really commanding central defender. I said since we lost Jamie Carragher we needed that leadership and he's a player who will gives us that. He's strong and can play. I was impressed by him when he was at Lyon and he was a big driving force for Southampton.’

Lovren will join up on Liverpool’s United States tour either in New York or Charlotte after agreeing a five-year contract and Rodgers believes his squad is now taking shape – and he is no longer mourning the sale of Luis Suarez.

‘I’m really pleased with how it's all coming along,’ said Rodgers, who should see Divock Origi become a Liverpool player in the next 24 hours, having agreed a £10million deal with Lille. ‘Our World Cup players have just come back.

‘We have only just been together as a squad over the last week or so. I know the group well and I know those coming in will fit what we're trying to do. When the Southampton game (at Anfield on August 17) comes up, we will be ready for that.'

Of the performance against Olympiakos, Rodgers added: ‘I was delighted with the team. As pre-season goes well, we will be getting sharper in our movements and passing but, at this time, we are building up the resistance of players and getting minutes under the belt.

‘In the first half, our passing was crisp and precise. We looked real threat at top end of the field. I was also very pleased with how we defended. We are in good shape and I am delighted.’
