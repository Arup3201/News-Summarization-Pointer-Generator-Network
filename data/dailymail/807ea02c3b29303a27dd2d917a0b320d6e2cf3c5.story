A teenage boy has been charged after his prom date was found dead in a hotel room hours after the dance ended last year.

Eddie M. Herrera, 18, was charged with aggravated assault on Wednesday in the May death of Jacqueline Gomez of Houston, Texas, after he admitted to choking her.

Miss Gomez, 17, was found in the hotel room of the North Houston Hyatt Hotel on May 17, 2014, the same venue where the prom had been held the previous night. 

Jacqueline Gomez, 17, died on her prom night in May at a hotel in Houston, Texas. Her boyfriend has now been charged in connection with her death

Investigators said Herrera told authorities the couple went to the hotel room after attending the prom, drank alcohol and fell asleep. 

According to the NYDN, Herrera also told police that his girlfriend had taken the painkiller hydrocodone.

Herrera said he found Miss Gomez, a senior at MacArthur High School, unresponsive the following morning.

Houston Fire Department personnel responded and pronounced her deceased. 

Her death was initially believed to be an overdose but the medical examiner could not confirm an exact cause.

Authorities said a further investigation led them to arrest Herrera, who attended the same high school, on Wednesday. He admitted to choking his girlfriend, police said on Thursday.

Herrera's name had been undisclosed until his arrest on Wednesday.  

The motive and official cause of death remain under investigation, according a police statement.

It wasn't immediately clear whether Herrera has a lawyer or whether he remained in custody today. 

At the time of her death, Miss Gomez's devastated family and friends told the Houston Chronicle that she was 'not a party girl' and spent most of her time working at a grocery school when she was not studying. 

The teenager had plans of going to Lone Star College to become a pharmacy technician.
