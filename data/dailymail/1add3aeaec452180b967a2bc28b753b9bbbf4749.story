Ed Miliband's leadership is in crisis today, as a new poll shows Labour has slumped to its worst rating since it had no-one in charge after its crushing 2010 election defeat.

A new YouGov survey puts Labour on just 33 per cent, two points behind the Tories, and the lowest levels of support since the weeks after Gordon Brown quit after being ousted from Number 10.

To add to Mr Miliband's woes, senior Labour figures rounded on his plans for a mansion tax, as Ed Balls mocked him for forgetting the deficit in his conference speech.

The latest YouGov survey shows how just 33 per cent of people now say they will vote Labour, the lowest level since June 2010

Ed Miliband has seen Labour's poll ratings tumble, amid reports of a leadership challenge and mounting criticism from party grandees 

Mr Miliband suffered a disastrous Labour party conference two weeks ago, in which he forgot key passages from his speech which he attempted to memorise.

He omitted any mention of the deficit and failed to refer to how he might tackle immigration to Britain.

It was followed by a successful Conservative party conference, during which David Cameron garnered positive headlines for his promise of a tax cut for 30million workers.

Reports have emerged of a plot to replace Mr Miliband with the more down-to-earth ex-postman Alan Johnson, while shadow health secretary Andy Burnham is said to be positioning as a leadership challenger.

The latest in a series of YouGov studies putting the Conservatives ahead has Labour on only 33 per cent, the party's lowest figure with the pollster since June 2010, before Mr Miliband's election as leader. 

The poll for the Sun put the Tories on 35 per cent, Labour on 33 per cent, UKIP on 13 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 8 per cent.

Mr Miliband has pinned his hopes of becoming Prime Minister on a promise of £2.5billion for the NHS, funded in part by a levy imposed on homes worth more than £2million.

However, there is growing criticism from within the Labour party about the mansion tax policy.

Margaret Hodge, chairman of the powerful Public Accounts Committee, told the Times it was 'too crude to work properly'.

She said: 'I don't think it's the world's most sensible idea. We need to tackle the idea that people are shielding their money in London through properties.

'The problem identified is the right one; I just think the solution is too crude to work properly.'

And former cabinet minister Dame Tessa Jowell told the newspaper: 'I am concerned about typically older families who are asset-rich and income-poor.

'They bought houses 40 years ago, which have appreciated enormously in value, and they certainly can't afford a mansion tax.

'The important thing is we set out how it will be applied and the fairness test that will apply.'

One of Labour's biggest individual donors, JML founder John Mills, told the Huffington Post the mansion tax could push people into negative equity.

'The problem with the mansion tax - apart from issues of whether it's fair or going to work - is it requires really tricky valuations,' he said.

'It's a step from zero to some quite large number which is going to produce all sorts of problems on the boundary. 

'If people have got mortgages, they could get into negative equity. There are these sort of problems as well.'

The Tories and Lib Dems have repeatedly mocked Mr Miliband's failure to mention the deficit in his speech.

Boris Johnson jokes last week: 'His subconscious rebelled. The baggage handlers in his memory went on strike – as they would under a Labour government – and refused to load the word deficit on to the conveyor belt of his tongue.'

Now Mr Balls, Labour's shadow chancellor, has joined the chorus of criticism, revealing he was 'surprised' that Mr Miliband had forgotten the economic section of his keynote conference speech.

He told ITV1's The Agenda: 'Well I had seen the speech a couple of weeks ago so it's one of those things where sometimes in life you can forget the most important things. In that speech, not talking about the deficit.'

He added: 'I knew what was in the speech and therefore I was surprised momentarily. I was surprised, but we are where we are. It's a really hard thing to stand up and make big speeches like that and do it from memory.

'I think if he could do the speech again it would be in. I think he was as annoyed by it as anybody would be.'

It comes after the Labour leader was accused by party grandee Lord Prescott of showing a severe lack of ambition in a damning assessment of his 'far too timid' strategy and underwhelming conference performance.

Prominent Labour donors also raised concerns over the weekend, with Lord Noon, one of the party's significant individual benefactors, saying the party 'really need to buck up' and Lord Levy, who was Tony Blair's chief fundraiser, criticising the tax plans as 'totally inappropriate'.
