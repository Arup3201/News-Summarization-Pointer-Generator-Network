Peter Wright has accused his fellow darts players of being ‘two-faced’ and says he trusts none of them.

Since reaching the final of the World Darts Championship last year, Wright has become a scalp for the lesser players on tour and has also been exposed to the Premier League for the first time.

And ahead of his second-round match at Alexandra Palace on Saturday against Ronny Huybrechts, Wright said that he has seen a different side to the world’s top players since joining the game’s elite this year.

‘There are a lot of two-faced players around,’ he said.

The 2014 World Championship runner-up said that he doesn't trust any of his fellow darts players

‘They should have the bottle to come and tell you things. It’s sad, but that’s where you’ve got to look after No 1 to make a living.

‘One thing I have learned is never to trust any of the dart players. Look after No 1 because you think they’re friends but all they are are acquaintances. Sometimes you talk to them and that’s it.’

Wright saw off Gerwyn Price in his first-round match before Christmas and takes on the experienced Belgian Huybrechts on Saturday.

The 44-year-old has endured a tricky year on the tour since making the final at Alexandra Palace 12 months ago, where he lost to Michael van Gerwen.

Wright hasn’t appeared in the final of a premier event this season and has won just two tournaments.

But the 2014 World Championship finalist says his focus is solely on the job in hand and not the mind games being played off the stage.

‘I’m here to earn a living and pay my mortgage and look after my kids. They’re just an opponent in the way and taking the money from you.

‘My advice to any kids coming up is to look after yourself.

‘I look after myself and my family. Jo (his wife) looks after me and I will set her on them.

‘What I loved about the Premier League is that I upset all the players. I used to get my own board to practice on because nobody would practice with me because I was different and said what’s what.’
