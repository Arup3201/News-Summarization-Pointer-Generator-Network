A triumphant Roger Federer admitted a record eighth Wimbledon crown would top his career achievements to date after his semi-final victory against Milos Raonic on Friday.

The Swiss star sailed through to the men's final with a straight sets victory against the young Canadian on Centre Court.

When asked about the potential of an eight gong in SW19, Federer said: 'That would mean a lot I must say, I'm unbelievably proud to keep walking the grounds and still be playing here,' he said.

'The first was so special in 2003, it was a dream come true.

'That I've been so successful for so many years has been an unbelievable thrill, and that I get another chance for success here, it's just great.'

Federer's stoic march through the field left him conceding he had almost produced the perfect route to the final.

'I'd say so,' he said when asked if he had found almost the perfect fortnight so far.

'I've played some great tennis, under pressure at times, because I didn't play so well here last year and I expect a lot of myself here.

'The second week now I've really been able to play better, against Wawrinka and then now again against Raonic.

'I needed big concentration really. I'm extremely happy to be in another final.'

Relishing his final showdown with Djokovic, he said: 'It's always great; we always play good matches against each other.

'Novak is a great champion, he's been around for a long time now and is used to these occasions.

'He knows how to get it done, so I hope it's going to be a good match.'
