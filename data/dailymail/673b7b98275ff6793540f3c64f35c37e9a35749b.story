Getting into the groove: The Regional Director for Group Fitness at West Coast Equinox Fitness, Keith Irace, says Strip Hop was created so people could connect with their bodies and feel empowered

Taught by renowned dance instructor Ginger Broussard, students move, bend, sway, and gyrate to the latest hip hop tunes.

The Regional Director for Group Fitness at West Coast Equinox Fitness, Keith Irace, says Strip Hop was created so people could connect with their bodies and feel empowered.

'Strip Hop is a class that combines hip hop choreography along with just sexy movement. It allows people to feel connected to their bodies and to just move in a way that is empowering to them,' says Irace.

Students say the class takes dance and fitness to a whole new level. The routine is taught first without music and only later is the sound is turned on.

Then, in complete synchronisation, students begin to move to the beat with choreography designed to raise the heart rate. The high intensity workout targets the legs, arms, neck, back, core and glutes and is said to burn around 800 calories an hour.

Beverly Hills real estate agent and Strip Hop student Alexis Donahoe says the routine lets her escape from real world pressures.

'Not only do you get an amazing workout, as you can see I'm drenched in sweat, but the feeling is that you loose yourself in the music. 

'You loose yourself in your body and you really, really, really get in touch with dancing and just freedom, just feeling free and letting loose and letting go and just enjoying the moment,' she says.

Sean Van der Wilt is a professional dancer who has worked with Michael Jackson, toured with Rihanna and Beyonce and just choreographed seven numbers for Cher's tour.

'It's basically fitness but without even thinking about it. It keeps you in really good shape. 

'I'm a professional dancer and it's made me feel so confident with who I am, what have and how to use it,' says Van der Wilt.

Equinox says its classes are regularly booked out and that there is often a waiting list for those wanting to Strip Hop.

Participant Nancy Diaz says it gives her a confidence she can't get elsewhere.

'This class makes me feel like me again. I have that dancer core inside and then I'm also a little bit shy at times I think so it really opens up that free spirit that woman inside that revs you up.

'It gives you confidence. I could leave here and I feel like i could do whatever. I'm leaving here leaping and dancing on my way out,' says Diaz.

Irace says they're always looking for new ways to make fitness fun and effective.

'A lot of the fusion workouts are just to keep people trained in a variety of ways. We're just watching the industry and they are watching us so it's a two way street. 

'We're looking for the new ideas and we're looking for the ideas to fuse together but the industry is also watching Equinox because we tend to be leading the way to when it comes to group experiences.' he says.

Los Angeles based celebrity trainer, Hollis Leibman says the class is an excellent cardio workout, but reminds people of the importance of warming up muscles beforehand because the 'muscles are not pliable yet.'  

Equinox say they always encourage people to warm up correctly, because when the classes start, the atmosphere soon gets very hot indeed.
