When thinking of secretaries, one’s mind could slip to the glamorous women walking around the Madison Avenue offices of Sterling Cooper Draper Price.

But data shows that the most common occupation for women today is still the same, with around 4million U.S. women working as administrative assistants.

The information comes as something of a shock, as better access to higher education has allowed women to enter in a highly competitive job market.

Working women: Census data from 1950 and 2010 shows that the number one job for women has been secretary in both cases, though the job is more

CNN Money, citing the most recent census data, says that of the 4million workers who worked as administrative assistants between 2006 and 2010, a full 96 percent were women.

The most common job in 1950 was also for the role of secretary.

The website notes that generalists – that is, people who have a variety of skills needed in an office environment – are always in high demand. That could help explain why nurses and nursing aides were the fourth and fifth most common jobs, respectively.

The data could be surprising to some who still picture secretaries as either naïve typists from Bay Ridge, such as Elisabeth Moss’ character Peggy Olson in ‘Mad Men,’ or curvaceous sex kittens like Christina Hendricks’ Joan Harris.

But following the Industrial Revolution, there was the need for extensive paperwork, filing, and scheduling to replace what was once a largely agrarian society. 

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, administrative assistants have steady work with a median pay of around $34,600 annually, or $16.66 per hour.

The BLS predicts that between 2010 and 2020, the date of the next national census, the field will grow 12 percent.

The information is contrasted by the best jobs for women, which, according to Forbes, are diagnosing doctors, other health professionals, medical scientists, and lawyers.

The role of secretary was one that, until the 1880s, was predominately filled by men, according to the International Association of Administrative Professionals. 

But with the invention of the typewriter, more women entered the workforce, many of them working as typists or filling other clerical positions. 

By the 1930s, many secretarial positions were filled by women, and by the age of ‘Mad Men,’ most every office had secretaries, typists, and other such workers.

A movement in the 1970s turned the tables on the term ‘secretary,’ and fought against some of the ways these workers were treated in the ‘Mad Men’ era.

And, as the IAA notes, administrative assistants today do much more than take down correspondence and file paperwork. Many of them also serve as office administrators, managing the workflow of entire offices.
