Bayern Munich face Shakhtar Donetsk on Wednesday evening knowing that the Champions League encounter could make or break their season.

Pep Guardiola's men are 11 points clear in the Bundesliga and into the quarter-finals of the German Cup, but it's Europe's foremost competition that is their main priority.

The Bavarians drew the first leg of this last 16 0-0 in Ukraine and start as strong favourites for the return at the Allianz Arena - but without the comfort of an away goal, they could be caught cold.

But the squad was in good spirits as they trained at their Sabener Strasse headquarters on the eve of the game, which Guardiola has billed as the biggest of their season.

'This match is a final for us,' the Spanish coach said after their 3-1 win at Hanover on Saturday. 'Only one thing matters and that is to win.

'We know what we have to do. They have extremely quick forwards and we cannot allow them to make their runs.'

But the odds are stacked against Shakhtar, whose league season only started at the end of last month. Bayern won all their home matches in the group phase without conceding a goal.

And they have scored a remarkable 21 goals in their last four league games, including eight against Hamburg and six at Paderborn.

Shakhtar's Romanian coach Mircea Lucescu said: 'We will be playing against a very strong club. In my opinion, Bayern are the world's strongest football team at the moment.

'We have to respond to therir extraordinary tactical discipline with equally strong tactical discipline.

'Their team is also superior to ours, but football does not follow logical rules. In football, anything can happen.'

Guardiola is without Xabi Alonso, who is suspended after being sent off in the first leg, but could have defender Mehdi Benatia back from injury.
