Two children and a man, believed to be their father, died in an explosion in Sweden on Friday morning.

Swedish police launched a murder investigation after finding three bodies following the blast, which completely destroyed the flat in Sundbyberg, north of Stockholm.

Emergency services were called to the scene at 04.28 this morning after an explosion shook the peaceful suburb.

Neighbour Leyla Hjeren, 20, was asleep next door.

'I was woken up by a bang, and then I heard thuds on the windowsill - like when snow falls in the winter,' she told Aftonbladet.

'I ran out on the balcony and saw the window next to mine completely blown out. That's when I started screaming.’

‘The blast woke me up. Bomb – that was the only thing I could think of - a bomb has gone off,’ said 12-year-old Sofonias Essayas who lives three floors above the destroyed flat.

According to Miss Hjeren, the couple living in the flat had two young daughters and was in the process of splitting up.

Destruction: The front of the flat is bulging following the explosion this morning which killed three people

Investigation: Emergency services said it was unclear how the explosion had come about, but Stockholm police has opened a murder inquest

'I heard that they were separating two weeks ago. They knocked on our door and told my brother.

'They were the best neighbours I have ever had, the only thing you would hear from there was Spanish music and then they would sing along.

'The children were so sweet and cute and happy. They were beautiful girls.'

After initially finding two bodies underneath the rubble, police found a third body after the fire was put out.

‘The windows are blown out, and the front of the building is bulging, as if there has been an explosion,’ Jonas Palm, spokesman for Stockholm Police said.

Police believe the dead man is the father of the two children and are treating the explosion as murder.
