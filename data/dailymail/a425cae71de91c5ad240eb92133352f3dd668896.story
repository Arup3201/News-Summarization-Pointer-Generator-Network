A British tourist was banned from leaving Egypt after being mistaken for an international antiques smuggler who had the same name.

Andrew May, 30, was held at gun point by armed security officers as he and girlfriend Julia Rowe, 28, waited to board a flight home from the resort of Hurghada.

The confused couple had just checked into the airport at the end of their week-long break and were sitting in the departure lounge when they were arrested and threatened with jail on September 28.

Home safely: Andrew May from Corby who was detained in Egypt, accused of smuggling Egyptian artifacts on his way back home from holiday

Eventually they learned that Egyptian authorities were looking for a man also named Andrew May who was suspected of smuggling hundreds of priceless artefacts out of the country.

Speaking yesterday, Andrew, from Corby, Northamptonshire, said: 'I was the third Andrew May to be prevented from leaving Egypt.

'At the airport it was a nightmare. There were people shouting and we couldn’t understand what was going on.

'I kept telling myself that this was clearly a mistake and someone would sort it out soon.

'I was asked to sign papers stating that I’d agreed to stay in Egypt.

'I was told it was either that or I would be taken to a prison in Cairo.'

Remarkably, while they were being held in custody, fellow Brit, who was also Andrew May, 54, and his wife Angela, 52, met them and explained they too had been held in custody.

The couple, who live in Cornwall, had also been kept in Egypt for two weeks after officers stopped them minutes before they were due to fly home from Luxor.

Andrew added: 'While we were being held another Andrew May and his wife, from Cornwall, were brought to us to explain the situation.

'They had been kept in Egypt for two weeks and were in a terrible state.

'They were able to give me numbers for a lawyer and a contact at the British Embassy.

'They were going home but our ordeal was just beginning.'

Andrew was forced to pay a lawyer £1,000 cash while the mix-up was resolved and says the ordeal has cost him £3,000 with additional hotel and travel bills.

He said: 'It was terrible waiting each day to see if we could fly home.

'When we were eventually told we could return to Britain, Thomson charged my girlfriend and I £8 each for seats on a coach to Luxor where we caught a plane home.

'I’ll be writing letters to complain. It was a terrifying situation to be in.

'What if the same thing had happened to an elderly couple.

'Each day we waited and waited for clearance to go home, worrying and spending money we couldn’t afford. Our families back home were worried too.'

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: 'We are aware of the issue and we are liaising with the Egyptian authorities.'

Earlier this month Andrew and Angela May were stopped from leaving Egypt for two weeks.

They were forced to drive to Cairo and hire lawyers and an interpreter - with bills costing £2,500 on top of their £1,500 trip.

Father-of-two Andrew, who is a fork-lift truck driver, said: 'It was bedlam when I went through passport control.

'They said, ‘There’s a no fly against your name’ - and took our luggage off the plane.

'Initially they said I was suspected of causing riots.

'Then it transpired they were looking for a man called Andrew May who has been stealing Egyptian artefacts. It was ridiculous.'

Angela added: 'The first two weeks were fabulous. We did everything I dreamed of. But this spoilt it.

'I wondered where the hell it would go. There has been no apology.'
