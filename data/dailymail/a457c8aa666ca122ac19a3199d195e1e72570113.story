From a life-sized Johnny Depp to an unbelievably lifelike elephant and a Kings Road-ready Cath Kidson bag, Cake International 2013 saw sponge cake modelled into works of edible art as bakers gathered to show off their creations.

Alongside exquisite spun-sugar flowers, popular creations included an almost life-sized Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow from the Pirates of the Caribbean, which was the work of Lara Clarke, an amateur baker from Brownhills, West Midlands. 

Lara told the BBC, 'When my father-in-law first saw him, he leapt about 10ft in the air thinking we had burglars.'

She said she began working on the cake, which measures 5ft 5in in September and admitted that, unlike the man himself, 'It's probably past its best.'

The highly coveted ‘Best in Show’ award went to Rose Macefield for her fishing themed cake, which featured a fishing basket, rod, net and trout.

Rose said: ‘I have been entering Cake International competitions since 2009 and have won gold and silver awards before but I never dreamt I would win the Best in Show, especially with such a high calibre of entries this year.

‘I wanted to make a cake based on a popular hobby and wanted it to be life-sized.  It took over 70 hours to make but I am thrilled that the hard work paid off – I am still in shock!’
