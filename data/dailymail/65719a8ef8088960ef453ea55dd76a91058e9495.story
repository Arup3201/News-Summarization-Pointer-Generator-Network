American lighter company Zippo could face legal action after publishing a photograph of the Olympic torch being lit with one of its lighters without permission to display the logo.

The picture shows a man in a black coat using the iconic lighter to re-ignite the torch after it went out while being held by 60-year-old former champion swimmer Shavarash Karapetyan on Sunday.

The flame had been blown out by a gust of wind as the retired Soviet-Armenian swimmer carried it along a passageway to the Kremlin in Moscow.

Zippo were lightning quick to seize on the marketing opportunity by publishing the image and video shorts across the internet with the hashtag #ZippoSavesOlympics.

Snuffed out: Zippo faces legal action after using this image of the Olympic torch being re-lit with one of its lighters (seen here on the Facebook page of the firm's Azerbaijani distributor Baku) without permission

The Pennsylvannia-based firm has since removed the picture from its Facebook page after Sochi 2014 officials warned it may be breaching strict rules on companies linking themselves to the Olympics unless they are official sponsors.

The image is still on the Facebook page of the company's Azerbaijani distributor Zippo Store Baku.

David Warfel, the global marketing director for the Pennsylvania-based company, told RIA Novosti: 'It was never meant to imply that somehow we had any relationship or sponsorship with the Olympic committee at all.'

It is not clear what legal steps are open to the organisers, Sochi organising chief Dmitry Chernyshenko told RIA Novosti.

Fire starter: A security guard was forced to light the Olympic flame with a lighter after it went out

Back in the game! Dmitry Chernyshenko, president of the Sochi organising committee, said on Twitter that the problem was due to a valve on the torch which had not been opened fully

The flame was lit a week ago in Greece and flown to Moscow for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.

However, the glitch occurred when a torchbearer ran through a long passageway leading into the Kremlin which apparently created a wind tunnel, extinguishing the flame.

A man standing along the route, most likely part of the presidential security service, pulled out a Zippo lighter and re-lit the flame.

Dmitry Chernyshenko, president of the Sochi organising committee, said on Twitter that the problem was due to valve on the torch which had not been opened fully.

It was not the first time the flame has been extinguished in Moscow.

Russian President Vladimir Putin was left red-faced on Sunday when he lit the Olympic flame in Red Square only for it to go out.

Torchbearer Karapetyan, a champion swimmer for the Soviet Union, once saved 20 passengers from a bus that had fallen into a reservoir.

He used his legs to break the back window of the bus as it lay in 10 metres (30 feet) of water, and pulled out 20 of the 92 passengers

The relay began in Moscow, where hundreds of athletes and public figures including Prince Albert II of Monaco took part.

The flame will now make its way across Russia, travelling from Kaliningrad to the easternmost point of the country just across the Bering Strait from Alaska, before swinging back to Sochi in time for the opening ceremony on February 7.

For most of the 65,000 kilometre (39,000-mile) trip, the flame will travel by plane, train, car and even reindeer sleigh, safely encased inside a lantern.

But 14,000 torch bearers also will take place in the relay at the more than 130 stops along the way.

One of the silver and red torches, unlit, will be carried into space in November for a brief visit to the International Space Station, and this same torch will be used to light the Olympic flame in Sochi. 

Putin, for whom the Olympic Games are a source of personal pride, said the relay will 'show the world Russia as she is and as we love her.'

It will pass through many cities that showcase the historical, cultural and ethnic richness of Russia, while other cities on the route are more closely associated with the evils of Stalinism, the harsh treatment of dissent under Putin or the Islamic insurgency simmering in the Caucasus Mountains not far from Sochi's ski slopes. 

As the relay crosses the expanses of Siberia, it will put the spotlight on Russia's immense wealth of natural resources and the rusting of its industrial towns.
