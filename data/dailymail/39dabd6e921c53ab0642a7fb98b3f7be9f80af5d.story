Chelsea's first ever black footballer Paul Canoville was left 'ashamed and deeply upset' by the footage of fans racially abusing a man on the Paris Metro as it reminded him of his own history.

Supporters were caught on video refusing to let a black passenger board a train at Richelieu-Drouot station in the French capital before chanting: 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it.'

Canoville was targeted after signing for Chelsea in 1981, and the 52-year-old has recalled how he would be subjected to vile taunts and have bananas thrown at him by his own fans.

Canoville was woken by a text message on Tuesday night which read: 'This is continuing where you left off, Canners.' The former winger was unaware what it meant until he saw the footage of fans preventing a black man from getting on the train heading for the Parc des Princes, where Chelsea were facing Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16 of the Champions League.

'I watched it and I was in disgust, I was so angry and ashamed,' he told the Evening Standard. 'We've done so much campaigning against the very issue of racism and this happens and it's brought it all right back down.

'I don't care if it's the minority because regardless of that it is connected to the club and when you mention Chelsea this will be the response. I can't believe this has come about.

'Chelsea have responded quickly on this and are going to ban the individuals but now at this very moment those people who know who is involved in this need to spot them out because we don't want them. Enough is enough and these people have to be banned for life.'

BORN: England, March 4, 1962 (age 52)

1981-1986: Chelsea (79 lg apps, 11 gls)

1988-1989: Enfield (9, 2)

1990-1991: Maidenhead United (17, 3) 

Canoville knows how such behaviour can have an affect, and he says he's been in the same situation as the passenger.

'The guy trying to enter that tube train must have been scared. I know how he feels,' he told the International Business Times. 'When I made my debut for Chelsea, at Crystal Palace towards the end of the 1981-82 season, I became the first black player to play for the club.

'People were shouting "negro this" and "black that". I thought it was coming from the Crystal Palace fans - only later did I realise it was coming from the Chelsea fans in the away end.

'I also had bananas thrown at me in that game, by my own fans. The same thing had happened to Clyde Best at the first game I ever watched, between West Ham and QPR. I couldn't understand what was happening, and then another supporter turned to me and, pointing at Best, said "your dad's not playing too well." I just didn't get it.'

All this led him to set up his foundation, Motivate to Change, which aims to eradicate that sort of behaviour by visiting schools and colleges.
