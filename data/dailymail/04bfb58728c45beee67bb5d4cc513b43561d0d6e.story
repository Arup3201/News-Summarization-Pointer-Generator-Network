The FDNY has sent a demand for payment to an 'unknown Asian' for $784 after taking a young woman to hospital in an ambulance.

The bill arrived on Tuesday at The New School building in Manhattan with the title 'Unknown Asian' based on patient information filled out by a responding EMS team.

The official bill from the FDNY - who charge for ambulances - lists a female patient being taken from a supermarket in the West Village to Beth Israel Medical Center on November 1.

The FDNY sent a bill for $784 to an 'Unknown Asian' after they took a female student to hospital in an ambulance last month in Manhattan after finding her 'intoxicated'

Christine Ahn, 29, associate director of academic communications, who looked over the bill at the dean’s office in Parsons The New School for Design, told the New York Post: 'I hesitated to open it but then I was like, ''Well, I could be an unknown Asian.'''

Dean's assistant Chris Rivera said that he thought the official letter was racist. He added: 'There must be ''unknown Hispanic'' or ''unknown African-American'' bills out there.'

The bill was issued after an EMS team picked up a young woman around 3am last month for a 'drug or intoxication' issue.

The person who accompanied the patient said that she lived in the New School dorm but could not provide a name.

FDNY spokesman Jim Long told MailOnline today that when EMTs deal with patients in the field who have no identification, they often have to use basic descriptions to fill out paperwork.

In this case, the emergency workers filled out the name as 'unknown' and the identifying characteristics as 'Asian' and 'female'. The form was the basis for a computer-generated FDNY bill.

Mr Long said: 'Unfortunately it didn't translate well from the EMT report on to paperwork. At no time was there any discrimination against any ethnic group.'

The FDNY spokesman also said that The New School may want to look at its policy for dealing with students in its care. 

The fire department has spoken to the vending company which processes the bills so that paperwork will no longer be sent out when a name box contains 'unknown'.

Staff at The New School were baffled as to how they should contact the 'Unknown Asian' listed as the recipient of the FDNY bill
