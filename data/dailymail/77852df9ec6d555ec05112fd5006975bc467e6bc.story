Sir Mick Jagger’s former girlfriend has revealed that she could have died through the pressures of their relationship.

Marianne Faithfull, who went out with the Rolling Stones front man in the 1960s, said being with him is ‘very difficult’.

The 67-year-old singer described how she took an overdose of pills while travelling with Jagger and said L'Wrenn Scott’s suicide by hanging ‘could have been me’.

Scott was found in her New York apartment with police later ruling that it was death by suicide in March. The 49-year-old left her estate, believed to be worth £6million to Jagger despite their relationship being described as ‘troubled’ by friends.

Faithfull, who sang the Jagger-Richard’s song As Tears Go By, is a daughter of an Austrian baroness, Eva von Sacher-Masoch. She  is credited for introducing the then young rocker to literature, ballet and opera.

She told The Sunday Times magazine that she had emailed Jagger following Scott’s death, but had not spoken to him.

‘I sent him an email on his private email address and just said “Love, compassion, so sorry if you need me or anything” that’s all,’ she said.

‘I look at poor L’Wren and I feel tremendous compassion because she obviously couldn’t cut it. Being with Mick was very difficult – and it could have been me. I did take a huge overdose in Sydney.’

Faithfull swallowed 50 sleeping tablets and washed them down with hot chocolate while on a flight to Australia with Jagger in 1969. She then drifted into a coma while arriving at their hotel.

‘I was unconscious for six days and nearly died, so that could have easily been me. Mind you, I was 22.’

Despite saying what the pressures were in her relationship, she described them as ‘enormous’. The previous year, she had been pregnant with Jagger’s daughter — whom she’d already named Corrina — but miscarried at seven months.

Faithfull said the pressures with a relationship with Jagger are: ‘Enormous, yes, but obviously for a lot of people it’s worth it.’

When asked why, she replied: ‘I really couldn’t say. And I wouldn’t say. That’ s nobody’s business. Anyway, it must be different for everybody. Most of those girls who are with him, since me actually, really like the fame and the money, all that s***. I never cared.

‘You have to be very strong, and poor L’Wren,’ she told the interviewer while shaking her head, ‘I think she also came from that very weird background, that Mormon thing.’

The end of their relationship was the start of a downward spiral into heavy drug use and alcoholism for Faithfull. After leaving Jagger, she was penniless, became a heroin addict and lived rough in Soho.

Last week Faithfull claimed that her drug-dealing ex-boyfriend ‘killed’ rock star Jim Morrison by giving him heroin which was too strong.

Mystery has long surrounded the death of The Doors lead singer after he suddenly collapsed and died in his Paris apartment in the summer of 1971.

More than 40 years on, singer Faithfull has claimed that her then boyfriend - a drug dealer called Jean de Breteuil - supplied Morrison with drugs which led to an overdose.

In an interview with Mojo, she said of de Breteuil: ‘He went to see Jim Morrison and killed him.

‘I mean I’m sure it was an accident. Poor B******d. The smack was too strong? Yeah, and he died.

‘I didn’t know anything about this. Anyway, everybody connected to the death of this poor guy is dead now, except me.’

Morrison was found dead aged 27 in the bathtub of a rented flat on Rue Beautreillis in the Marais district of Paris. French authorities revealed he died of ‘natural causes’ following an autopsy.

De Bruteuil himself died of an overdose later the same year in Morocco.
