Britain's longest serving landlady has spent 60 years behind the bar, and still has no plans to stop pulling pints anytime soon.

Olive Wilson, 79, took over the Royal Oak in Ockbrook, near Derby in 1952.

Over the years her reputation has grown and in 2003, to celebrate her 50 years as publican, brewers Coors created OWB – Olive Wilson’s Brew.

Legend: Britain's longest serving landlady Olive Wilson has spent 60 years behind the bar, and still has no plans to stop pulling pints anytime soon

When she began her career she had no experience behind the bar and said it was unusual for women to work, let alone be landlady.

The grandmother-of-four was reluctant and thought she would only spend a few years at the pub with her husband Lewis before they moved on.

'The customers were all men and I did my ironing behind the bar if it was quiet,' said Mrs Wilson told The Mirror.

She said that on Saturday evenings men would play darts and women would bring their knitting to the pub.

To get punters in she hired a television knowing few people in the village would be able to watch the Coronation.

But she was shocked when people brought in their own 
sandwiches and flasks of tea.

She explained that when she started out the prices were very different to now.

'It cost 11 old pence for a pint of mild and a shilling (5p) for a pint of bitter.'

Mrs Wilson said the range of alcohol was limited and it was only cask ales that were sold along with port and sherry.

Licensing hours were 11am to 3pm and 5pm to 10.30pm.

The couple eventually bought the pub with Lewis's retirement money, but Mrs Wilson's name is still above the door as it was when the couple began working at the pub - her husband worked on the railway during the day. 

Since his death in 1994, she
now runs the pub with daughters Jean Hornbuckle and Sally Parrott, but 
said she that they still do not stock modern drinks such as alcopops. 

Her reputation has preceded her and Mrs Wilson has won many accolades including CAMRA’s rural pub of the year twice.

In 2000, Cottage Brewery in Somerset named its Olive’s Oil ale after her.

Over the years Mrs Wilson has 
witnessed many changes and cites the 2007 smoking ban as a positive move
saying she hated the smoke. 

Mrs Wilson believes the secret to her success is clear: 'I have always been interested in people and I’m a very good listener.'

I learned to love it. I couldn’t imagine doing anything else now.'
