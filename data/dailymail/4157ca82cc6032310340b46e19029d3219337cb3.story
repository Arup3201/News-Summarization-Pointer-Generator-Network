A drummer from the heavy metal band Scorpions, the group behind the anthem Rock You Like a Hurricane, has been jailed for a month for getting drunk and flashing his middle finger at Muslims in Dubai.

James Kottak, 51, allegedly started swearing and took his trousers down after drinking five glasses of wine on a flight from Moscow.

He was on his way to Bahrain, where he was due to a perform at a Formula One Grand Prix concert, when he was arrested and detained.

Rude gesture: The drummer was said to have pulled his trousers down and shown his middle finger to passengers

The American was said to have gotten angry and started shouting when he entered the transit hall by mistake.

When he saw the Pakistani and Afghan passengers, witnesses said Kottak swore at them and began talking about 'non-educated Muslims'.

An officer claimed he then said: 'What is that disgusting smell', according to The National.

A 27-year-old employee at the airport, said: 'When he [Kottak] saw the Pakistani and Afghani passengers, he covered his nose and said that there was no way he will travel with them.'

His
 lawyer had earlier argued that Kottak did not commit an indecent act, 
but only wanted to show his tattoo to members of the public.

Kottak refuted the charges, telling prosecutors: 'I don’t remember saying these words and I did not flash my middle finger.'

His lawyer, Hamid Al Khazraji told the Dubai Court of Misdemeanours that his client was innocent and that the witnesses' statements were contradictory.

Kottak has been fined Dh2,000 (£323; $544) for 
drinking and will be deported. He admitted to drinking, but denied 
gesturing indecently in public and cursing Muslims.

The drummer from the band, whose hits include Rock You Like a Hurricane and No One Like You was  jailed for a month, but will be released soon as he has already spent time in custody.
