Scott Quigg stayed true to his word as he defended his WBA super-bantamweight title against Stephane Jamoye in Manchester.

The Bury man said he would floor the Belgian with a body shot and in the third round he put him down with that very weapon.

Jamoye was unable to recover and the bout was called off, with Quigg sending the perfect message to domestic rival Carl Frampton.

Quigg wants to meet Frampton - the new IBF holder - in a domestic grudge match and that will now be at the top of the agenda.

Jamoye had already been roughed up by Quigg's work to the body in the opener and, despite a busier second, was done for in the third.

'I was happy with that, I went in there and systematically broke him down,' Quigg told Sky Sports 1.

'I knew he was tough to the head so I went to his body. That was the plan of attack. I broke him down.'

On Frampton, he added: 'It's the fight I want next. If he wants to sit down in a room... If Carl doesn't want to sit down at the table... They're the fights I want and I want to test myself against the best.'
