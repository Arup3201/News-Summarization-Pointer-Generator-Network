School chiefs have been blasted by parents after banning pupils from going to the toilet during lessons - even locking the doors during class times.

Parents of pupils at Westlands School and Sittingbourne Community College  in Sittingbourne, Kent, were outraged after being told their children could only go to the loo during lessons if they had a note from their doctor.

The two secondary schools, both part of the Swale Academies Trust, have a grand total of 2,700 pupils between them, with 1,600 at Westlands School and 1,100 at SCC.

School authorities say the only children allowed to go to the loo during lesson times are those who hand their teacher a note from their doctor with a 'relevant medical condition'.

Wee disagreement: Parents of pupils at Westlands School and Sittingbourne Community College in  Kent, were outraged after being told their children could only go to the toilet during lessons if they had a note from a doctor

One father, who asked not to be named, said his 12-year-old son, a pupil at SCC, came home last week and told him about the ban.

The 42-year-old said: 'My son came home and told me that all the school toilets were locked when they were in their lessons.

'He said that one pupil asked to go, saying they were desperate and they were told they could only go during break time.

'The simple fact is that children are embarrassed to ask in front of their friends, so the school will end up dealing with a lot of wee on the floor if they don't change the policy.'

 Clare Stevens said her stepson Kieran was a pupil at the Westlands School and that he had been refused to be excused from class to go to the toilet.

She said her son was told he must go and see the nurse first, who would then decide on whether he could use the loo.

'What happens if a child has a funny tummy and needs to go right there and then?' asked one parent

Speaking this week, she told the Sittingbourne News: 'The nurse's office is a 10 minute walk to the other side of the building, and all the toilets are locked on the way there.

'When he got there the nurse questioned him about why he had to go.'

Mother Sam Bright, whose daughter is in Year 8, said: 'She was absolutely bursting the other week and she was told that she couldn't go and to sit back down unless she had a medical note.'

Another, who asked not to be named, said: 'How can they treat children like this?

'What happens if a child has a funny tummy and needs to go right there and then? Why are they locking the loo doors - the whole thing is preposterous.'

Simon Cox, the head of Westlands School, said the only toilets open to children during lessons were at the nurse's office.

He added: 'During lessons, when teachers are in classrooms, safeguarding protocols would suggest that it is not common sense to allow pupils to have access to toilet areas which are not supervised.

'We encourage pupils to use our extensive toilet facilities at break time and lunchtime, but the school provides an alternative facility during lessons, which is supervised by our support team.'

SCC head teacher Fiona Trigwell said: 'The policy of the school is children don't go to the toilet during lesson hours.'

A spokeswoman for children's charity ERIC (Education and Resources for Improving Childhood Continence), which campaigns on the slogan 'Every Child Has The Right To Go', said the policy was 'totally wrong'.

Rhia Weston, of ERIC, said: 'It is extremely important that children are allowed to go to the toilet when they need to, otherwise they can develop problems with their health and wellbeing.

'Preventing them from going by locking toilets or having a school policy of no toilet breaks is the completely wrong approach.

'What schools often don't realise is that this kind of policy can affect children's school performance as well because of the impact that holding on or not drinking enough water can have on concentration and energy levels.

'Children who do not drink enough water at school because they want to avoid using the toilet can also suffer from headaches.

'This is an issue that affects all pupils, not just those with continence problems, so schools need to take it seriously.'
