Religious role: The Queen, pictured on the 60th anniversary of her coronation, has to uphold the 'laws of God'

Legalising gay marriage could force the Queen to break a Coronation oath, a senior clergyman warned yesterday.

Bishop Michael Nazir-Ali, former Bishop of Rochester, said the Queen vowed when she was crowned 60 years ago to ‘uphold the laws of God’.

He claimed that signing into law an act allowing same-sex couples to marry would contravene that promise.

He spoke as opponents of same-sex unions launched a last-ditch bid to kill the plans in the House of Lords today.

Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will demand amendments to the Bill to protect those with moral objections.

Gay marriage passed with a large majority in the Commons and polls show most of the public are in favour, but it will face a tougher ride in the traditionalist Lords.

Bishop Nazir-Ali made his comments in a service outside Buckingham Palace on the 60th anniversary of the Coronation.

He later told the Mail: ‘The idea of a  constitutional monarchy comes from the Bible. Christians are told in the Bible to obey their rulers, unless the ruler tells us to do something God forbids.

‘Happily in this country we have a monarchy that has taken an oath of upholding God’s laws, and the present Queen has for years been faithful to that. We are praying that she continues to be faithful.

But while she is faithful to the vows she has taken, in this country she has to act on the advice of her ministers.

Debate: Bishop Michael Nazir-Ali, with the Queen, says that the gay marriage law is at odds with 'the settlement of the Church of England'

‘That puts the onus on the Prime Minister not to put the Queen into a position where she may have to go against the sovereign promises she has made. We hope that she is not put in that position.’

He said legalising gay marriage could  put the Queen at odds with the ‘law of God and the settlement of the Church of England’, adding: ‘Ministers should not be putting her in a position contrary to what she has promised.’

Peers will discuss the controversial legislation today and tomorrow, after it passed in the Commons last month backed by the overwhelming majority of MPs.

It is set to meet opposition in the House of Lords, which has an older membership and seats for Church of England bishops.

More than 85 have asked to speak in the debate, forcing the Government to carry over the vote to a second day. Archbishop Welby is expected to call for amendments so faith schools and teachers who do not wish to ‘promote’ gay marriage in class will not be penalised.

He will ask for changes to ensure opponents are not prosecuted under equality laws for expressing their views and to stop registrars being sacked if they refuse to carry out same-sex unions.

Contentious: Peers will discuss the controversial same-sex marriage legislation, after it passed in the Commons last month

Polls have repeatedly shown the majority of the public are in favour of the Bill.

But Conservative Grassroots, a group of rank and file party members, has written to a national paper calling on peers to ‘defend our freedoms’ by voting against.

The letter from chairman Bob Woollard says David Cameron’s focus on gay marriage is ‘alienating’ Tory supporters.

‘The golden inheritance of every previous generation, that has been lovingly handed down to us, is being smashed on the anvil of “equality and fairness”,’ he writes.

Yesterday, former Tory chairman Lord Mawhinney said a ‘large majority’ of party members are opposed to gay marriage. He told Sky News: ‘Most people who have been party members for some time are adamantly opposed to it and indeed a number of them are demonstrating their opposition by simply leaving the party.’
