These pictures show the dramatic scene after a car smashed into a ground floor flat.

The driver of the silver Volkswagen Polo was arrested for drink driving following the crash, which led to an evacuation from the block of flats.

The incident took place at 10pm last night, with residents having to wait until the early hours of the morning to find out whether they could return to their homes.

The driver of this Volkswagen Polo was arrested for drink driving last night after his car smashed into a flat

The man who lived on the ground floor flat, which the car crashed in to, escaped uninjured despite the fact a section of his ceiling caved in.

The driver, who was arrested at the scene, in Russells Hall, Dudley, West Midlands, had to be cut from his car by fire crews.

While every other resident in the building was able to return home - after a three and a half hour wait - the ground floor flat tenant had to stay with friends away from the scene.

According to one resident, occupants have been told the damage may not be fixed until at the earliest.

According to a resident, fire crews took two hours to cut the motorist out of his car at the scene

Resident Jake Stone, 29, a teacher, was in bed when the crash ‘shook’ the entire building.

‘The person who lives in the flat was in the room at the time - he got covered in dust from all the bricks but luckily he was on the other side of the room when the car collided with the wall,’ he said.

‘He managed to get himself out of the flat and even tried to help the driver of the car.

‘It must have been horrendous for him.’

Mr Stone said that he and fellow residents were evacuated and had to wait to find out whether they would be allowed back into their homes.

He added: ‘The fire crew and police arrived and got all the residents out - it took about two hours to remove the car.

‘There was quite substantial damage caused to the block - we weren't allowed back in until around 1 am.

‘While we were waiting for the all-clear some of us were wondering whether or not we'd have to find somewhere else to stay.

‘I know the man in the flat the car hit has gone to stay with friends - the structural engineer from the council said the damage may not be fixed until Christmas at the earliest.’

Residents had to wait three and a half hours to be allowed back into their homes on the Dudley estate

Commander Andy Clay, from Dudley fire station, said: ‘One man was in the flat at the time and managed to get out, but fire crews had to rescue the person that was driving the car.’

‘The resident was shocked.

‘He said something fell from the ceiling and then all of a sudden a car was in the room.’

All six residents were allowed to return to their homes today after it was deemed safe following the smash at 10pm on Saturday night.
