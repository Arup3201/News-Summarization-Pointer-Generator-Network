In the City of Lights, lovers can fasten a padlock to the Pont de l’Archeveche bridge and then throw the key in the Seine to 'lock up' your eternal bond

Whether strolling the Seine, indulging in some exquisite cuisine or fastening padlocks to the Pont de l’Archeveche, there are romantic activities abound on offer in the French capital.

Interestingly, though beach holidays were  the top choice for couples (35 per cent), the most popular destinations were overwhelmingly European cities.

Venice, Italy, is popular getaway for happy couples, where those in love can admire the Renaissance architecture while being ferried along the canals in a gondola.

Prague was another top destination for beer-loving couples. The Prague Castle - the highest point in the city - proved to be a particularly romantic tourist attraction

Prague, Czech Republic, proved another hot spot for pairs, with Prague Castle being one of the must-see tourist attractions.

For those who prefer a warmer climate, Phuket, Thailand, Negril, Jamaica, and Cape Town, South Africa, all also made the list.

Adventurous couples may opt for a safari adventure in Africa, or a backpacking trek in Thailand, while those in need of some R&R don't need to look any further than the white sandy shores of Negril's Seven Mile Beach.

Though Couples Resorts found beach getaways to be the most popular (35%), the cities of Paris, Venice and Prague still topped the list of suggestions
