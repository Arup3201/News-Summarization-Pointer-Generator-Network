Manchester United defender Patrice Evra has paid tribute to Sir Alex Ferguson and the Old Trafford faithful after finalising a deal to join Italian champions Juventus for £2.5million.

After nine years at Old Trafford, Evra has decided now is the time to move on, penning an open letter on the official club website expressing his gratitude to the club.

He said: 'After a great deal of thought I have decided the time is right for me to leave Manchester United. It is the biggest decision of my career as this club is, and will always remain, in my heart.

'Joining and playing for Manchester 
United has been a privilege, a dream come true and my time here has been
 so memorable. Through the good times and the bad times we have all 
stuck together and remained loyal. I have always said you don’t just 
join Manchester United, you join the family and long may that tradition 
continue.

'This club is steeped in history and I feel privileged to have become a part of that. Over the past nine years I have met and worked with some incredible people, many of whom will remain friends for life. I would like to thank everyone at the club - team-mates, coaches and in particular all the staff who made every single day in Carrington or at Old Trafford a special day.

'An immense thank you to Sir Alex Ferguson for making it all possible, for giving me the privilege to be a captain, to be inspired by the legend of Manchester United and to understand that nobody is bigger than the club.

'My biggest thanks go to the fans. We have had some fantastic times together, we lifted all of those trophies together and that night in Moscow will live with us all forever. Every single time I stepped out in that shirt I knew I was playing for the badge and for a very special club.

'My passion for this club will live on and I know you guys will go on to enjoy more success in the coming seasons.'

The Frenchman had held talks with new Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri, who reassured Evra that he was still very much wanted despite Antonio Conte resigning, and he kept his promise as the experienced left-back has now joined the Turin side on a two-year deal.

It was just two months ago that the experienced full-back signed a one-year extension to his contract at Old Trafford, but following Luke Shaw's mega-money move to United he consequently fell down the pecking order.

The move to Italy sees Evra reunited with former United colleague and friend Carlos Tevez at Juventus, who like the Frenchman was a fans' favourite at Old Trafford.

United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward said: 'There's a lot going on behind the scenes so watch this space.

'We’ve
 been working with Louis (van Gaal) over several weeks with regards to targets and 
we’re continuing to move forward on some of those targets. We are still a
 huge attraction to top football stars around the world.'
