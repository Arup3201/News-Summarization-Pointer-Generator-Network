The man wanted on murder charges over the fatal poisoning of Vladimir Putin foe Alexander Litvinenko in London is seeking to turn American whistleblower Edward Snowden into a Russian TV presenter.

Andrey Lugovoy, a former secret services operative who is now a leading Moscow MP, is accused of spiking the emigre dissident's tea with radioactive polonium-210.

Putin refused to extradite him and he is now to front a television show about intelligence and spy agencies.

He has invited former National Security Agency contractor Snowden - who is hiding in Moscow after revealing America's eavesdropping secrets to the world - to co-host the show.

'We have sent an invitation to Snowden,' said Andrei Svintsov, a Lugovoy associate.

'We hope his experience and knowledge will help our audience to learn all nuances in the sphere of secret service and interaction between our security services.'

The LDPR TV channel is run by Lugovoy's ultranationalist political party, which backs Putin.

Both Snowden and Lugovoy are on international wanted lists and face arrest travelling to any Western country.

Snowden fled the United States in June 2013, after leaking information concerning the extensive electronic surveillance programmes conducted by the US government around the globe.

These includes spying on American citizens and foreign leaders.

The revelations sparked domestic controversy and strained relations between the Washington and its partners worldwide.

Snowden - who faces up to 30 years in jail in the US - received temporary asylum in Russia in 2013. Later he was granted a residence permit until 2017.

He lives with his US girlfriend under tight security in the Russian capital.

Litvinenko died in 2006 after being poisoned.

A British demand for Lugovoy's extradition in 2007 was rejected by Moscow.

Snowden has not yet reacted to the proposal.
