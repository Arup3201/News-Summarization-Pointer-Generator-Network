She established her reputation for calculated malice in a one-line message designed to devastate her love-rival.

Valerie Trierweiler, the 47-year-old girlfriend of French President Francois Hollande, caused outrage when she used her Twitter account to publicly back a political opponent of Segolene Royal, Mr Hollande's ex-partner and mother of his four children.

Ms Royal, 58, went on to lose her bid to become MP for La Rochelle earlier this month, later blaming the hated Ms Trierweiler for a vicious stab-in-the-back which effectively ended her career.

Now Ms Trierweiler, a glossy magazine 
journalist, has twisted the knife even further by supplying the captions
 for a new book tracing her own career elevation to First Lady of 
France.

In 'François Hollande, President', she
 writes highly personal – and some would say extremely catty - 
commentaries beside a range of colour photographs.

One shows Mr Hollande and Ms Royal, 
who lived together for 30 years after falling in love as students, at a 
political rally in Rennes, Brittany, earlier this year.

'Ah, the Rennes rally! Or rather, the 
Hollande-Royal rally,' writes Ms Trierweiler scornfully. 'In short, the 
Francois-Segolene reunion. Lots has been written since the start of the 
week, the photographers are here en masse.'

Beside a photograph of the two 
ex-lovers together, Ms Trierweiler writes: 'Are they going to kiss, hold
 hands? This is the crucial question my colleagues are asking.'

As well as Ms Royal's status as an 
ex-lover, Ms Trierweiler points to her status as an ex-presidential 
candidate who lost to Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007.

Telling off: Following Valerie Trierweiler's (pictured right) Twitter comments, Prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said 'everyone should know their place'

Ms Trierweiler continues: 'Yes, the 
man I love had a woman before me. And she happened to be a presidential 
election candidate. I have to live with it.'

Ms Royal, like Mr Hollande a 
passionate Socialist, always dreamed that they would make a golden 
left-wing couple on the world stage, but instead it is Ms Trierweiler 
who finds herself in the Elysee Palace.

Ms Royal in fact lost yet another election when she stood in the primaries against Mr Hollande last year.

Recalling the night when Mr Hollande 
learnt he was victorious, Ms Trierweiler writes: 'As soon as we heard 
the result, we went off on our own together for a few moments.

'He took me in his arms. Away from prying eyes. I cried. He laughed. Both of us were emotional.'

There were even more dramatic scenes 
back in 2011 when – on May 14 – Mr Holland and Ms Trierweiler learned 
that Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the president of the International Monetary 
Fund, was arrested in New York for allegedly trying to rape a chamber 
maid.

Mr Strauss-Kahn had been the hot 
favorite to become Socialist president this year, but his humiliation in
 America ended all hope of a successful political career, and opened the
 door for Mr Hollande.

Recalling the fateful night, Ms 
Trierweiler said: 'I wake up Francoise up quickly. By way of answer he 
whispers "Go back to sleep, all this is bullshit". I check the mail and I
 insist that the news is already out.'

The book is full of gushy praise for 
the president the twice-divorced Ms Trierweiler calls 'my man'. She says
 'Francoise is always online when crisis requires' and that his election
 campaign meant moments 'of solitude, moments of tension and of great 
joy'.

Ms Trierweiler has continued to write 
for Paris Match since becoming First Lady and, in a review of a book 
called Breaking the Charm this month, wrote: 'Every family lugs around 
its share of dramas, secrets, and elephants in the room.'

Despite her apparent confidence, Ms 
Trierweiler is known to be upset that the four adult children of Mr 
Hollande and Ms Royal have stopped speaking to her.

She was initially defiant about the malicious tweet, but has now admitted to friends in Paris that she 'made a mistake'.

Mr Hollande, meanwhile, was said to be  'furious' at what his new lover had done, telling her that 'it can never happen again'.

In turn, Ms Royal said she was 'deeply wounded' by the 'violent blow' of Ms Trierweiler's tweet.

If she had won La Rochelle, Mr 
Hollande was set to appoint Ms Royal speaker of the National Assembly – 
the third most important political position in France after President 
and Prime Minister.

Instead she has become increasingly 
bitter, even accusing Ms Trierweiler of plotting against her ever since 
she started a relationship with her ex-partner.

Ms Trierweiler met Mr Hollande while 
covering the Socialist Party for Paris Match in 2005, but their affair 
was kept secret while Ms Royal fought the 2007 election campaign.

'Francois Hollande, President' is published by Le Cherche-midi.
