The owner of this distinctive car evidently has something to hide... why else would he have completely coated it in the skin of a bison?

The Russian hatchback is covered from dashboard to boot in cured leather, all stripped from the carcasses of nearly a dozen of the Canadian mountain beasts.

Owner Maxim Sarmatov got so carried away with his unusual project that he even canvassed the engine in pelt that was specially-treated for added heat resistance.

He is now trying to sell the car on Russian auto-trading site Avito for the mammoth sum of 40million rubles (£784,000).

For extra finish, he even claims he employed master engravers from the Middle East to carve a series of elaborate inscriptions on the skin.

The bison is a key symbol in North American and Canadian culture, and is used in official seals, flags, and logos.

There are currently around 500,000 bison in captive commercial populations on about 4,000 privately owned ranches. However, only 15,000 total individuals are considered wild bison in the natural range within North America.

Yeah great. But I must admit I think the skin looks better on the bison.

The wheels and tires are American, but who is the auto manufacturer and what model IS that?

Hate the leather covering - but what an amazing looking car. I'd like to see it under all that leather.
