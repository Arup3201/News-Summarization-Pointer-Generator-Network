Rio Ferdinand will not appeal his three-game ban for using the word ‘sket’ - slang for a promiscuous female - on Twitter.

The QPR defender was handed the punishment by the FA last week, who found him guilty of misconduct for abusing another user on the social media platform on September 1.

Ferdinand insists he used the term as a joke and has now received the written reasons for the ban from the FA.

Rio Ferdinand has been given a three-game suspension by the FA and will not appeal his ban

Ferdinand was charged with misconduct for this tweet, made on September 1, for using the slang term 'sket'

Ferdinand is active on social media, with 5.9million followers on his Twitter page and over 14,500 tweets

However, despite being unhappy that just one language expert was used to decide his fate, Ferdinand has decided that appealing would be a waste of time and money. He feels that appeals are rarely successful and it would cost him in the region of £30,000.

That means Ferdinand’s punishment of a three-game ban, £25,000 fine and order to attend an education programme stands.

Although Ferdinand accepts that his response on social media to a tweet about his performances in a QPR shirt was inappropriate, other players have escaped FA scrutiny for similar offences.

Such is the former England defender’s anger, that he is considering withdrawing his support from future FA initiatives, as revealed by Sportsmail last week. 

The 35-year-old slammed the FA's punishment as 'ludicrous' on Twitter last week. He wrote: 'Is humour even allowed....I'm baffled! Ludicrous.... & I don't mean the rapper'. 

He was immediately backed up by his team-mate Barton, who wrote: 'Surely a person has the right to be offensive? Especially if someone offends you? Shambolic that @rioferdy5 misses 3 games and loses £25k.' 

Barton then went on to question the FA's rules about what is and isn't offensive.

Ferdinand’s manager Harry Redknapp also criticised the ban, which was at the same level as a red card for a two-footed tackle.

Redknapp said: ‘The same as a two-footed challenge? No. If someone slags him off and he goes back and slags them off. It doesn’t equate. I genuinely don’t know what goes on on Twitter. It would save all the hassle if no-one was on Twitter.’

Ferdinand also received support from Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker, who tweeted: 'Must say I think the @rioferdy5 3 game ban is ridiculously harsh. A little warning would have sufficed, surely.'
