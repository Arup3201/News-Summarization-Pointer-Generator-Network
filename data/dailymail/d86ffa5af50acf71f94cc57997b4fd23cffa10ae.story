Risk: George Nicholls, 25, has been fined after he balanced a 20 foot ladder on top of his van to paint gutttering on a busy road, while a workmate held the ladder

A roofer has been fined £4,000 after he balanced a 20 foot ladder on top of his van to paint guttering on building next to a busy road.

George Nicholls, 25, dangerously improvised when he found he could not reach the top of a shop front from the pavement in Southampton, Hampshire.

He put his fully-extended ladder on top of his van and climbed eight metres above ground to paint the facade, while a workmate climbed on top of the van and stood at the foot of the ladder.

However, a passerby photographed the precarious set-up and reported Nicholls, who was prosecuted by the Health and Safety Executive.

A court heard that Nicholls had also parked his van over a bus stop on the busy road as he carried out the work.

Magistrates in Southampton were told that either Nicholls or his labourer could have fallen, and that there was no form of segregation to stop vehicles or pedestrians from passing under or near the work area.

The court also heard how a pavement licence should have been obtained to create a properly segregated safe-working area and scaffolding should have been used.

Nicholls, of Newdigate, Surrey, who runs Laser Roofing London and South East Roofing Limited, admitted breaching health and safety laws and was fined £4,000 and ordered to pay a further £666 in costs.

Maintenance 24-7 Ltd, of King's Lynn, Norfolk., who sub-contracted the work to Nicholls, also admitted safety breaches and was fined £10,000 with £784 costs by the same magistrates.

'The photographic evidence speaks for itself in terms of the risks created,' said HSE inspector Frank Flannery.

'Anyone can see the system of work is plain wrong, so why a supposedly competent roofer chose to work in this way is anyone's guess.

'George Nicholls blatantly and recklessly risked harming himself and others, and he did so on behalf of Maintenance 24-7 Ltd, who had clear duties of their own to ensure the work at height was properly planned, managed and executed in a safe manner.

'The standards of both parties fell far below those required, and I would like to thank the concerned member of the public who initially brought the matter to the council's attention.'
