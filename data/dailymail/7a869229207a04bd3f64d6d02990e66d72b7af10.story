Fulham have signed Greece international left-back Konstantinos Stafylidis on a season-long loan from Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen.

The West London club have an option to make the transfer of the 20-year-old, who has one cap for Greece, permanent at the end of the season.

It is Fulham's second signing in two days, and their sixth of the summer following relegation from the Premier League.

Manager Felix Magath has also signed Tim Hoogland, Adam Taggart, Kay Voser and Shaun Hutchinson as well as completing an £11million capture of Ross McCormack from Leeds on Tuesday.

Leeds owner Massimo Cellino has since claimed he had no choice but to sell McCormack after the striker was disrespectful to him.

'I like to be in control of situations but it felt like he wasn't my player,' Cellino told the Yorkshire Evening Post.

'I was disrespected, he was aggressive with me. He didn't turn up for the tour and all the time he wanted to go from here. It wasn't in my mind to sell McCormack, it wasn't my plan, but I had no choice.

'He's a bloody good player and I'm not going to pretend that he isn't but he didn't respect me and it wasn't possible to keep him.'
