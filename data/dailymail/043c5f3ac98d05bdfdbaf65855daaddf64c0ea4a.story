A nine-year-old boy nearly lost his ear after he was mauled by his teacher’s dog during a school trip.

Primary school pupil Marshall Gearing was stroking the brown Labrador when it suddenly jumped up and sank its jaws into the side of his head.

His right ear was torn so badly it was hanging by a thread of skin and the schoolboy needed two operations to re-attach it.

In fear: Marshall Gearing, pictured at Northampton A&E shortly after he was bitten, was attacked by his teacher's Labrador on a school trip

Marshall’s mother Amy, 23, is now demanding the teacher’s dog be put down as she claims it is ‘the only way to keep the children safe’, although both the school and police rule the attack to be out of character for the dog.

She said: ‘Marshall will be scarred for life and is now scared of dogs. He has nightmares and doesn’t want to leave my side when we go out.

‘Marshall was stroking the dog, which was off the lead, when it suddenly leapt up and bit him.

‘Marshall told me he felt his ear getting ripped and thought the dog had torn it off completely'

Scared: Marshall has been suffering nightmares since the attack and stays close to his mother in the street

The mother-of-two added: ‘There was a lot of blood everywhere which covered the dog’s muzzle and the children were screaming.

‘The
 teachers called an ambulance and Marshall was rushed to hospital. He 
had one operation to reattach half his ear but it didn’t work so he 
needed another one.

‘He’s been off school for three weeks and has missed loads of work.

‘When
 the police came to see me in the hospital they told me the teacher 
would not be arrested because it was apparently ‘out of character’ for 
the dog to attack someone.

‘I hate to say it because I am an animal lover but that dog now has the taste of blood and it should be put down.

Back on his feet: Marshall was forced to take three weeks off following the bite but has now returned to school again

Pupils at Kingsthorpe Grove primary School in Northampton, had been treated to a day out in the park with their teachers when the incident occurred

Marshall, a pupil at Kingsthorpe Grove Primary School in Northampton, was taken on a day in the park with his classmates last month.

The 30 pupils were accompanied by six members of staff and one of the teachers brought the pet.

She said: ‘The full attention of the staff should have been on the children rather than on a dog. Marshall is back at school now but it has really affected his confidence.’

Headteacher Jamie Nairn, said police had carried out an investigation and, after speaking to Amy, had decided to deal with it via a ‘community resolution’.

The incident had also been referred to the health and safety department of Northamptonshire County Council and the local authority child protection officer.

In a letter to Ms Gearing, Mr Nairn said: ‘After weighing up all of the evidence from the statements and interviews, and knowing what I do having met the dog on a number of previous occasions, I am of the opinion that this was an awful accident that could not have been foreseen.

‘Appropriate action was taken once the incident occurred following school procedures.

‘However, we are reviewing our risk assessments involving animals when they come into contact with children in our school.

‘We have also taken the decision not to allow this particular dog further access to the children in our school.’

The head teacher said the dog was ‘extremely placid and very well trained’ and had been with many of the children on a number of occasions before.
