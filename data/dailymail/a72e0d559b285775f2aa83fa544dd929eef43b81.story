Japanese referee Yuichi Nishimura will handle the opening game of the World Cup between Brazil and Croatia as FIFA picked the same official who oversaw the Brazilians’ elimination in the last tournament in South Africa.

FIFA also selected Nicola Rizzoli of Italy to officiate the hotly-anticipated Group B game between world champion Spain and the Holland, a rematch of the ill-tempered final four years ago.

Nishimura will be joined by compatriots Toru Sagara and Toshiyuki Nagi, who will be the assistant referees for Thursday’s tournament a opener at the Itaquerao stadium in Sao Paulo. Iran’s Alireza Faghani is the fourth official.

Chosen one: Yuichi Nishimura will referee the World Cup opener

Man in the middle: Nicola Rizzoli will take charge of Spain versus Holland

Favourites: Luiz Felipe Scolari and Neymar know that there are big expectations placed on Brazil

The 42-year-old Nishimura handled four games at the last World Cup, including Brazil’s loss to the Holland in the quarter-finals. He sent off Brazil’s Felipe Melo in that game for stamping on Arjen Robben as the Brazilians surrendered the lead to lose 2-1.

Of FIFA’s 25 referees for Brazil, Nishimura is one of five that have been retained from the World Cup in 2010. The others are Ravshan Irmatov of Uzbekistan, Joel Aguilar of El Salvador, Peter O’Leary of New Zealand and Howard Webb of England, who refereed the final.

Out of control: Howard Webb refereed the 2010 World Cup final and will be at the tournament again
