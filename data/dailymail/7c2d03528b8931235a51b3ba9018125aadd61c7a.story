 A mother was insane when she drove her three children into the ocean and therefore not guilty of child abuse, a Florida judge determined on Friday.

Three attempted murder counts were dropped against Ebony Wilkerson who showed little emotion during her appearance in a courtroom today in Daytona Beach, Florida.

The 33-year-old was declared not guilty by reason of insanity on three counts of child abuse by Circuit Judge Leah Case. 

The judge ordered a hearing for December 16 to determine whether the woman should be involuntarily hospitalized for treatment or released with court supervision.

It will also be decided at the hearing whether to allow Wilkerson contact with her youngest child, who was born while she was in custody, ClickOrlando reported. 

The judge and attorneys said the process was rare.

'This is kind of out of the ordinary, and we've been doing this a long time,' Judge Case said.

After the hearing, assistant public defender Craig Dyer said he had been practicing law for 37 years, 'and this is my first time' participating in this type of hearing.

The deal between prosecutors and Wilkerson's attorneys was reached this week after a psychologist hired by prosecutors agreed with a defense psychologist that Wilkerson had a psychotic break during the incident.

Wilkerson, of South Carolina, drove her van into the surf off Daytona Beach, Florida on March 4. 

One of the children fought with Wilkerson over the steering wheel as the car was entering the water and was able to lower the windows to call rescuers' attention.

Bystanders and officers pulled her and her children - aged three, nine and ten, from the van as it was pulled into the waves. 

Wilkerson, who was pregnant at the time of her arrest, reportedly punched her belly after being taken into custody and had to undergo psychiatric treatment.

She gave birth to a boy after her arrest. The child is in the custody of her husband, Lutful Ronjon. 

In 2005, Ronjon, who was at the time Wilkerson's common-law husband, was arrested for domestic battery after an argument between the couple over receipts. 

Her three other children have been in state custody since March.

In October, a judge ruled she could send them pre-approved notes.  

During next week's hearing, the judge will consider testimony and depositions from psychologists who evaluated Wilkerson in the weeks after her arrest.

Wilkerson told the judge on Friday that she would waive her right to a jury trial. 

She said she was mentally competent to make that decision and wasn't under the influence of drugs or alcohol. 

When the judge asked her whether she was thinking clearly, Wilkerson said, 'Yes, I am.' 

Wilkerson was released after her arrest and had been awaiting trial on $90,000 bail, according to Daytona-News Journal.
