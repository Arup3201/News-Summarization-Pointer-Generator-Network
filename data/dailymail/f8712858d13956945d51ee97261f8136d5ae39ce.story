While crossing one of the most dangerous rivers in the world, these wildebeest take to the air to help them reach the other side safely. 

The wildebeest migrate from the Serengeti Plains in Tanzania to the Masai Mara in Kenya every year. Around 20,000 prepare to cross the Mara River in Kenya whilst on a two-month-long 1,800-mile journey. 

To ensure they are not eaten by crocodiles or dragged down by the currents, the wildebeest jump up to 10ft as they cross the Mara.

Crossing the Mara River can prove fatal. Crocodiles hunt them in the water and they are met with hungry lions, leopards and hyenas on the other side.

But the migration is essential to wildebeests as they follow the growth of the 'red oat grass' - a grass packed with nutrients needed for survival.

The annual migration sees the wildebeest spend 10 months per year in the Serengeti National Park and two months in the Masai Mara

Many wildebeest populations are experiencing rapid declines and the annual crossing of the river is crucial for their suvival
