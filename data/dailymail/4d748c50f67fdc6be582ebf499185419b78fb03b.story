As one of the greatest film villains of all time, Darth Vader is the sort of character that nightmares are made of for young boys.

And this child on a tricycle burst into tears after being introduced in Kiev to an impersonator of the Star Wars character, who happens to be the leader of Ukraine's Internet Party.

Vader - who had his name legally changed by deed poll - is campaigning ahead of the parliamentary elections on Sunday on a platform of promoting e-government and improving financial transparency.

He was seen with a Stormtrooper and security personnel talking to children, having arrived in style on top of a black van with the words ‘Інтернет Партія України’ (Ukraine's Internet Party).

The party also has contenders named after Star Wars characters Yoda, Padme Amidala, Chewbacca and Palpatine, who have been registered by Ukraine's Central Election Commission as candidates.

There are 16 men named Darth Vader registered to run - and they are among a number of people listed under the names of Star Wars characters, according to a BBC News report earlier this month.

Roadside advertising across the Eastern European country shows Chewbacca promising to ‘slap the hairy hand of corruption’, while another sees Vader speak out against war.

Manifesto: Vader is standing on a platform of promoting e-government and improving financial transparency

In June,  Imperial Stormtrooper characters donated blood to sick children, with one Vader saying: ‘Now Ukrainian children will have some blood from fearless Stormtroopers running in their veins.’

Seven of the Vaders were nominated for parliament by the Internet Party. In April, a man called Darth Vader was rejected in his bid to run for presidency by the country's Electoral Commission.

According to the BBC, one official suggested the aspiring candidate’s campaign could have been made in an attempt to mock elections in Ukraine.

An opinion poll showed yesterday that President Petro Poroshenko's bloc holds a big lead ahead of the election - while the Radical Party of populist Oleh Lyashko looks set to take second place.
