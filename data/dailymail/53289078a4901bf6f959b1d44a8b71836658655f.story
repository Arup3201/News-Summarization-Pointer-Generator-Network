The University of Connecticut is banning a sorority after reports of hazing straight out of the film Dazed and Confused.

Kappa Kappa Gamma was put on suspension in March after hosting a party with Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity in which sophomore Hillary Holt was hospitalized for alcohol poisoning.

In addition to being forced to drink beer, wine and shotsÂ  until she blacked out, Holt says she and other members were ordered to lie on the floor and pretend to 'sizzle like bacon,' imitating a famous scene from the film.

Time to leave: Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority has been banned from the University of Connecticut following reports of hazing

Dangerous game: Sophomore Hillary Holt was at a party in march in which she was forced to drink beer, wine and shots until she passed out and work up in the hospital with three times the legal limit of alcohol in her system

In the scene, a group of high school women haze the incoming freshman girls by making them lie on the ground a roll around while they yell: 'Fry like bacon you little piggies!'

The university made an official decision to drop the sorority from campus on Wednesday, with a letter sent to the chapter president.

'UConn has zero tolerance for hazing and all similarly harmful behaviors, and repeatedly makes those expectations clear to all student leaders in Greek life and other organizations,' school spokeswoman Stephanie Reitz said in an email.

Just like in the movies: Holt also says that she and other members were ordered to lie on the ground and 'sizzle like bacon' in a scene straight out of the film Dazed and Confused where a group of graduating high school seniors haze the incoming freshman girls

Embarrassing: In the scene, a senior orders the incoming freshman girls to lie on the ground while she screams: 'Fry like bacon you little piggies!'

'The university's decision to revoke Kappa Kappa Gamma's registration and recognition was not taken lightly, but it was appropriate and imperative in light of the severity of the circumstances.

The sorority's national chapter issued a 
statement in March saying it does not tolerate hazing and "will continue
 to be an advocate for anti-hazing education across the country."

The chapter may reapply as a student organization in four years. SAE will learn if they are allowed to stay on campus at a meeting next week.

KKG has until 4pm on May 15 to vacate it's current on-campus house and until May 14 to file an appeal.

In March, Holt gave an interview with WFSB, explaining the details of the raucous hazing party.

Holt said she drank so much she blacked out and woke up in the hospital where she was told her blood-alcohol level was nearly three times the limit of 0.08.

Up in the air: The Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity was also suspended and will learn if they are allowed to stay on campus at a meeting next week

'You have seven to nine people yelling at you, girls and guys, and if you don't do what they tell you to, the consequences could get worse,' Holt said.

At the time, SAE national spokesman Brandon Weghorst issued a statement saying the party was 'not consistent with out expectation.

SAE just changed a crucial policy this year, eliminating the pledging process in an effort to 'address some of these issues'. Pledging is the process of becoming a new member of a Greek organization and the process can often involve doing dangerous or embarrassing tasks in fraternity recruitment.

According to a recent report in Bloomberg, SAE is the deadliest U.S. fraternity.

The school also is investigating hazing charges against three other Greek organizations. Delta Zeta, Delta Gamma and Sigma Chi were placed on interim suspension in April amid allegations that men were forced during off-campus parties to eat dog treats, paint their bodies, wear women's underwear and take alcohol shots off each other's bodies.
