Two robbers who broke into a suburban Oklahoma City house and held the owner at gunpoint three years agp must have thought they had gotten away with their crime by now - but Google saw what they did. And Google has not forgotten.

The two men were spotted moments before their crime by a Google Street View van that happened to be mapping out the quiet neighborhood in July 2011.

The victim, who spoke to KFOR-TV, says she only learned of the breakthrough recently when a neighbor happened to look up her street on Google Maps and spotted the men.

Suspects: Three years after a violent robbery, a Google Street View image emerged of the robbers moments before their crime

The men were captured on camera - by accident - by a Google van that was mapping the neighborhood streets

Now the homeowner, who was held at gunpoint by the thugs for more than an hour while they ransacked her house, hopes the pictures of her two assailants - accidentally captured by Google - could lead to a break in the case after three years.

The victim said that when her neighbor sent over the images from Google Street View, she instantly recognized them as the men who robbed her.

Their faces are obscured - both by the grainy quality of the image and Google's software that automatically blurs pedestrians.

However, police in Oklahoma City are hoping someone can recognize the two, who are believed to be the robbers.

The victim said she did not want to give her name to KFOR because she still lives in fear after the robbery.

'They pulled a gun and held me for over an hour. There were times that I thought they would shoot me before they left,' the homeowner said.

The woman said she happened to come home and walk in on the crooks looting her house. Instead of fleeing, they held her while they ransacked the home.

Anyone with information is asked to called Oklahoma City Crime Stoppers at (405)235-7300.
