Today show co-anchors Savannah Guthrie and Natalie Morales braved New York’s ‘blizzard’ together this morning, trudging through the snow side by side on their way to work – and even posing for a photo during their cold commute.

The image was shared on the official Today Twitter account, along with the caption: 'Snow buddies @NMoralesNBC & @SavannahGuthrie walk to work together this morning!'

But the camaraderie between the pair didn't last for too long, with Ms Guthrie, 43, taking to her own Twitter account to reveal that Ms Morales, 42, had pelted her with a snowball just minutes after their picture was taken.

'Not much in the snow dept in NYC - six inches or so - I walked to work - no cars allowed on streets (cept plows etc),' she captioned the photo on Twitter.
