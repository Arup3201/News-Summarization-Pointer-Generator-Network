It may not have achieved the box office success of other films this year, but The Fast and the Furious 6 certainly won over fans on Facebook.

According to research from social monitoring firm Expion, the film, starring Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, received more than 42.4 million fan interactions on the social networking site.

This was more than double that of second place film The Hunger Games.

Social monitoring firm Expion has ranked the top 10 movies of last year based on the number of comments, likes and statuses each one received. The Fast and the Furious 6 received 42.4million fan interactions, more than double that of second place film The Hunger Games

The least talked about film in the top 10 was Alfonso Cuaron's space thriller Gravity, which received a relatively measly 482,788 interactions.

To compile the list, Expion analysed the Facebook pages of popular films from 1 January to 5 December 2013 to discover which page, and in turn which film, had the most engaged Facebook fans. 

By analysing the number of comments, likes and shares, Expion was able to create the number of Fan Actions each film received.

It also looked at the most popular characters from these films and pitted the lead roles against each other.
