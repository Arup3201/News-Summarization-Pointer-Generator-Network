Social networking site Twitter has said it will consider the removal of images of dead people at the request of family members.

In a crackdown on gory and upsetting photographs that have emerged on the site recently, Twitter said it would consider taking down images of deceased individuals 'from when critical injury occurs to the moments before or after death'. 

But the site said it would take into account the public interest of any content and warned that it may not agree to all requests.

Beheaded: James Wright Foley in a grab taken from YouTube and posted online by jihadist militant group ISIS

Twitter said it would consider taking down images of deceased individuals 'from when critical injury occurs to the moments before or after death' by request of family members

The announcement follows the shocking beheading of American photojournalist James Foley, 40, by an ISIS militant yesterday. 

Graphic footage of the gruesome execution appeared in a video called 'A Message to the US', was posted on social media by the terrorist group.

In the video, the journalist, dressed in an orange jumpsuit, is forced to give a message to his family and links his imminent death to the US government's bombing campaign of ISIS targets in Iraq.

He is beheaded with a small knife over a period of seven minutes by a masked man dressed in black, speaking with a London accent.

Yesterday, the White House contacted social networks asking them to remove videos of his death.

Twitter declined to say whether it had also received a request from Mr Foley's family.

The policy change also comes a week after Robin Williams' daughter Zelda abandoned her Twitter account over distressing digitally altered images of her father.

Twitter trolls posted a fake photograph claiming it was her dead father.

She wrote: 'I'm shaking. I can't. Please. Twitter requires a link and I won't open it. Don't either. Please.' 

Robin Williams hanged himself on August, 11, while his wife slept in a nearby bedroom.

At the time, Twitter's vice president of trust and safety Del Harvey said: 'We will not tolerate abuse of this nature on Twitter.

'We have suspended a number of accounts related to this issue for violating our rules and we are in the process of evaluating how we can further improve our policies to better handle tragic situations like this one.

'This includes expanding our policies regarding self-harm and private information, and improving support for family members of deceased users.'

But Google's former public policy chief Andrew McLaughlin warned the photos could have an important news value. 

He told the Washington Post: 'You can imagine that if you're a family member of this person, by all means you would want the horrific photos of their moment of death taken offline.

'But the photos are obviously newsworthy.

'It's awful that these photos were taken, and it's awful that this moment happened, but their very existence is news.

'It's the sort of thing that moves history.'
