Request: A man called 'sheffieldguy' deemed himself a confident lover when he posted a notice for 'no stings attached fun' on Mumsnet

When a newly single man decided he wanted to find a new love, he decided to try his chances by venturing onto Mumsnet in search of a potential date.

Within minutes of posting a romantic request on the popular parenting website, the 35-year-old was deluged with more than 400 replies from women on the site.

But sadly for the man, who advertised himself as being 6ft, athletic and well-endowed, the responses were from members of the website who were less than impressed.

The mystery man using the pseudonym ‘sheffieldguy’ had boasted on the site that he was ‘a very attentive and confident lover’.

But it was his insistence that he was ‘not looking for a relationship, just some NSA (no strings attached) fun’, that seemed to rile the women.

He quickly became the subject of ridicule on the website, as well as on Twitter where hundreds of women took the opportunity to mock his plea.

In his post on Mumsnet on Tuesday afternoon, the man wrote: ‘I wonder if this gets tried a lot? Or am I the first guy to think of this angle? This will probably get deleted in minutes, but hey, I’ve got a day off with not much else to do. Nothing ventured, nothing gained, as they say.

‘So, I’m 35, 6ft, athletic, well-endowed and recently single. I’m not looking for a relationship, just some NSA (no strings attached) fun. Not into one-night stand. I’d rather click with someone a bit and have repeated fun whenever convenient for both of us. ‘

He added: ‘(I am) Very open minded and quite kinky, but just as happy to have a more “regular” intimate encounter as well.

‘So if you’re bored sexually at home, or not getting any at all... drop me a private message. I’m happy to travel up to an hour or so from Sheffield.’

Women on the site quickly started posting sarcastic replies, including: ‘I bet your inbox is ON FIRE’.

Lynn Schreiber, a site user, posted on Twitter: ‘Bless his cotton socks. Don’t we all know a guy like that? Thinks he’s God’s gift to women.’

She added: ‘And here’s me on my own for a few days while DH (dear husband) away on business.’

Another added: ‘Have to admire that level optimism!!’

While one wrote: ‘What an old romantic!’

Officials at Mumsnet appeared not to approve of the man’s bid for love and deleted his post, replacing it with a limerick instead.

Backlash: 'Sheffieldguy' was hit with more than 400 replies within minutes, attacking him for his request

It read: ‘There once came from Sheffield this guy, who gave the Mumsnetters the eye.

They weren’t all that keen, ‘cos he wasn’t Sean Bean, and the size of his knob was a lie.’

In a tweet they added: ‘Here’s what happens when you look for NSA fun on Mumsnet.’

In October last year, a post on the website went viral after a woman asked fellow mothers if their partners ‘dunked’ their penis into a beaker of water left by the bedside table after having sex.

‘We have a dedicated post-sex cleanup area on the bedside table,’ she wrote. ‘A box of tissues, a small bin, and a beaker of clean water for temporary cleaning/dunking while the bathroom is occupied by me.

‘Apparently our penis beaker is strange and not the done thing.”

Another mum quickly replied: ‘No. We have a normal bedside table. With books and a lamp. Not a sex clean-up bit!’

The post quickly became a popular discussion on social media sites such as Twitter, with people expressing their amusement using the hashtag #penisbeaker.
