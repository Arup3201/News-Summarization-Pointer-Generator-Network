A man who lost half of his face to a vicious cancer can now look forward to getting his life back on track after having a implants for a new face as part of the Embarrassing Bodies show.

Eric, 60, tragically lost the left side of his face four years ago after being diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma, which occurs when small growths called polyps grow into tumours.

Unfortunately Eric didn’t discover the lump until it was too late and underwent dramatic surgery to have his left eye removed in order to save his life.

It's back: Channel 4's Embarrassing Bodies is back and in a new episode we meet Karen and Eric, who lost half of his face to a vicious cancer

Speaking on Channel 4 show Embarrassing Bodies, Eric’s partner Karen said: ‘I had no idea it was going to end up like this, it's just something I have to live with.

'It doesn't bother me, who I fell in love with is in here, this bit is just the outside.

‘Eric is now completely cured of the cancer so you have to take some things to gain others.’

Eric and 48-year-old Karen decided to visit Dr Christian Jessen on the TV show to see what could be done to help Eric.

‘We want to tell our story and show others that life isn’t all doom and gloom and that there are ways of curing these things; there is a light at the end of the tunnel,’ said Karen.

The couple, from Waltham Abbey, Essex, can be seen on the show meeting with Dr Andrew Dawood of Dawood & Tanner, who is an expert in dental implant surgery and has been working on a bespoke procedure for Eric.

Using a 3d technique, he has created a new face for the cancer survivor and the show sees him try it on for the first time.

‘It’s going to be the first time in nearly four years, that you’ve got a whole face and we will see you as you were,’ says Mr Dawood as he helps Eric fit his new face into place.

Watching avidly, Karen cannot hide her overwhelming joy and exclaims: 'That's my Eric, he's back.

‘You have got your face back and it looks perfect, it's amazing.’

Describing the moment in an interview with MailOnline, Karen said: ‘It was unbelievable, I’ve got him back.

‘Hopefully he can now go out with his friends to the pub; it will give him a real confidence boost.’

Eric has had his first transplant but is still gradually undergoing the procedures to fit his new face fully. He will have a magnetic bar fitted to hold it into place and the couple are thrilled.

Karen, who met Eric when they were both working together at a hotel, has been his absolute rock.

‘It’s not been easy. I have down days but family support helps me and my granddaughter Amelia brightens up my days.

‘She is great with Eric, she is only three and never frightened of him, it’s remarkable.

‘When he had his first implant she saw him and said “Granddad, you’re still broken, the hospital will still fix you won’t they?”’.

The couple are still waiting to get married after Eric popped the question on Christmas Day.

‘He covered my eyes and took me into the kitchen. He’d prepared this lovely romantic meal with champagne.

‘We will wait to get through this and then we are hoping to get married this year,’ said Karen.
