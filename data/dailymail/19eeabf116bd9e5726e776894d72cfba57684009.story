This is the couple who have been left red-faced after they were caught performing a sex act in the foyer of a high street bank during the early evening.

Phillipa Botting, 23, was seen kneeling in front of boyfriend Gareth Healey, 23, after sneaking into the Lloyds TSB foyer, which was open for cashpoint withdrawals.

A court heard the pair were caught by the bank's security cameras and were also spotted by passers-by - including a 10-year-old girl - during the incident at 6.30pm.

Botting held her head in her hands in 
court today as the footage from the bank foyer was shown to magistrates 
during a hearing in which the pair were spared jail.

Speaking at court,  prosecutor
Ellie Weale said: 'A housewife and her 10-year-old niece were at a high
street taxi rank when a group of rowdy and loud men and women went 
past.

'The woman said the couple came close to them and began rubbing against each other in a very sexual manner.

'Another member of the group came over and said: "F****** stop this now, there are kids here and you are making me horny".

'They then went into the bank foyer and her 10-year-old niece said: "I can see his long skinny thing and floppy bits."

'The
CCTV footage shows Healey back into the room with his trousers around 
his ankles and Botting puts her head to his groin area.'

Miss Weale said the young girl was very upset by what she saw and needed to be calmed down.

Police were called to the bank at Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, after reports of a couple engaging in sexual activity.

Police watched the CCTV footage of the indecent act, which lasted a minute, and recognised the couple.

Mark Layton, defending Botting, said: 'It was an impulsive act - a moment of madness.

'It
was not done to offend anybody and not an offence which she gained any 
sexual gratification by the public nature of the offence.

'She wasn't aware there was a child present who could see what was happening.

'A child of such tender years should never have to witness to this kind of act.'

Both defence solicitors said alcohol 'played a large part' in the incident.

The court heard the couple are no longer together. Botting and Healey, both of Haverfordwest, admitted outraging public decency by committing a sexual act in a public place.

Healey was sentenced to 16 weeks in 
prison, suspended for 24 months, and was ordered to complete 15 alcohol 
awareness sessions and complete 180 hours unpaid work.

He must pay £150 court costs and and £80 victim surcharge.

Botting
was also given a 16 week prison sentence, suspended for 24 months, and 
must attend 15 alcohol awareness sessions and complete 220 hours of 
unpaid work.

She must pay £2,000 court costs and an £80 victim surcharge.
