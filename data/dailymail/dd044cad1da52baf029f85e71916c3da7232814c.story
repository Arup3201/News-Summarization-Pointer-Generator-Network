A Manhattan underwear heiress who filed a multi-million-dollar lawsuit against her deadbeat husband over charges that he raided her trust fund to shower his mistress with gifts, won a legal victory Wednesday when her former flame failed to show up for court.

Candice Feinberg Lalicata, the daughter of Herbert Feinberg, one of the creators of seamless panties, sued her two-timing ex, tanning salon employee Steven Lalicata, for $10 million after he looted more than $700,000 from her inheritance to buy his mistress, Diana Fernandez, lavish gifts.

When Lalicata failed to attend Wednesday's court hearing, the judge in the case issued a summary judgment in favor of Feinberg Lalicata.

Claims: Candice Feinberg, pictured at her wedding to Steven Lalicata, alleges her husband tricked her out of tens of thousands of dollars

'I’m assuming he’s slithered under some 
rock in Queens,' Candice Feinberg Lalicata’s attorney told The New York 
Post after the judge ruled in favor of his client.

According to court papers, Feinberg Lalicata was led to believe her husband had gambling debts with an organized crime group.

'Through a series of coordinated 
communications, they led her to believe physical well-being would be in 
jeopardy if she did not make huge amounts of cash available to him on 
short notice,' the  lawsuit claimed.

The case alleges that rather than being in debt and danger, Lalicata 'was stealing the money to live a double life'.

The couple had met in April 2010, when Lalicata was working at the Beach Bum Tanning Salon in Manhattan.

Shortly after he started dating Ms Feinberg, a divorcee with a five-year-old son, Lalicata learned that she had just cashed in her trust fund.

It was then that he allegedly started befriending her son before proposing just a few months into their relationship.

Shortly after their wedding, Lalicata started to disappear overnight or for a few days at a time.

When his new wife confronted him, she claims he told her 'he had been gambling and had run up large debts to 'individuals 
connected with organized crime in Brooklyn who would hurt him if he did 
not pay,' the suit claimed.

When his cousin and a friend allegedly backed up his story, Ms Feinberg started to wire tens of thousands of dollars to him to clear the debt.

When he allegedly pushed her for a further $150,000 - telling her when the debts were gone they could focus on starting a family - she mortgaged her Upstate New York home to raise the money.

The suit claimed that Lalicata staged a handover with a friend posing a gangster, who met them in a car outside the bank so she could hand over the cash.

That night, Lalicata allegedly told his wife he was having trouble sleeping and went downstairs - only to disappear.

A few days later Ms Feinberg discovered that he had been on vacation with Fernandez in the Dominican Republic.

Double life: The lawsuit claims that after they married Steven Lalicata would disappear from the couple's Manhattan apartment, above. When confronted he allegedly told his wife he had run up gambling debts

With the help of a private detective, Ms Feinberg allegedly found her husband had been having a relationship with Fernandez and instead of using her money to pay off gambling debts he had used it for luxury shopping trips to buy his mistress 'jewelry, luxury goods, home 
furnishings and travel'.

An employee at the couple's former Manhattan apartment told the New York Post Lalicata would return from shopping trips with goods from Louis Vuitton and Armani.

The employee, who has not been named, claimed Lalicata would say: 'Hold these for me. Don't tell my wife.'

Attempts to get her husband to admit to fraud on tape in July 2012 failed after he allegedly seduced her at a hotel to invalidate the tape.

Ms Feinberg told the New York Post: 'I am concerned that these people may pray on other victims ... I believe that they brought me and my young son into their confidences solely from the get go, to steal as much as they could from me.'

The suit, filed in the spring of 2013, seeks repayment of $744,105 and $10 million in damages from Lalicata, Fernandez and their friends for false arrest and fraud.

A lawyer for Fernandez denied that his client had been involved in any wrongdoing or that she had been romantically involved with Lalicata.

Justice Anil Singh on Wednesday ordered a future proceeding to determine the amount Steven will have to pay Candice for the con job.

Lalicata could not be reached for comment.
