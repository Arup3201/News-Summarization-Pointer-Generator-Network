The former playboy son of Muammar Gaddafi has been broadcast on Libya's state television in prison uniform apologising and begging for the nation's forgiveness.

Al-Saadi Gaddafi was extradited to Libya and locked up in Tripoli earlier this month from Niger, where he had taken refuge after his father's regime crumbled in 2011.

Prison authorities say the video is in response to ‘rumours’ that al-Saadi Gaddafi is being tortured in custody.

Libyan state TV has aired footage showing al-Saadi Gaddafi (pictured left in 2005 and right from a prison in Tripoli), one of late dictator Muammar Gaddafi's sons, jailed in Libya apologising to the nation

The Libyan government is preparing to prosecute him for his alleged role in trying to suppress the uprising against Gaddafi's rule.

In the video, al-Saadi is wearing blue prison uniform, sitting in what looks like an office.

He says he is sorry for the ‘harm and disturbances’ - without elaborating - and adds he is being treated well in prison.

Earlier this month al-Saadi
 became the second son of the ousted and slain leader to be held in 
custody in Libya.

His brother Seif al-Islam was captured in 2011 and has
 been held in a western mountain prison by a militia that is putting him
 on trial, refusing to hand him over to the central government for 
trial.

At the time of the 
revolt that brought down his father, al-Saadi headed a brigade of 
special forces that was involved in the crackdown against protesters and
 rebels.

But he is perhaps even more notorious among Libyans for his career in football, the country's most popular sport.

A playboy with a lavish lifestyle, 
al-Saadi treated the country's soccer league as his personal fiefdom. He
 played for several Libyan teams — and for an Italian team until he 
failed a drug test. At various times, he headed Libya's soccer 
federation and its national team.

In
 one case, security forces opened fire on fans in a 1996 match attended 
by al-Saadi, killing a number of people in murky circumstances.

He is 
also suspected in the 2005 killing of Bashir al-Riyani, a popular Libyan football player who was a vocal critic of Gaddafi's regime.

Libyans say 
that rules were set that the only player's name that could be announced 
was al-Saadi's — while others were identified only by numbers.

Cars
 honked horns in celebration in the streets of the capital, Tripoli, 
when his extradition was announced early hours in the morning.

In the 
evening, fireworks went off as people cheered and waved flags in the 
street, according to footage on Libya's Al-Ahrar TV. A group of soccer 
players held public memorial for al-Riyani.

'This is a joy for all Libyans,' one Tripoli resident, al-Sharif Gheith he told AP, saying Gadhafi's family and his regime officials are to blame for the country's woes.

‘But now, thank God, they are captured and all of the country will be calm,’ he said.
