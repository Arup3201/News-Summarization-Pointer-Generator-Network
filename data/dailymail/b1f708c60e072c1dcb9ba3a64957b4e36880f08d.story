The unstoppable Duck Dynasty is on course to snatch cable TV's ratings record from The Walking dead after 11.8 million viewers tuned in to watch the start of the new season.

The boss of A&E Network's is cautiously optimistic that the hilarious exploits of a Louisiana family and their duck merchandise business still has plenty of room to grow.

With some 'fun episodes coming down the pike', the show needs just 600,000 more viewers to equal current record holder, zombie fest The Walking Dead, which recorded the highest ever ratings for a show of any kind when 12.4 million people tuned in earlier this year.

A&E Network's general manager and executive vice-president David McKillop was reported by Today as saying: 'I’m a superstitious man so I don’t make (ratings) predictions.

'But do I think we’ve found the ceiling yet? I don’t know, but I don’t think so. We have some fun episodes coming down the pike. So keep your seat belt fastened.'

Last week's ratings put Duck Dynasty at the top of the pile for highest ever audience tuning in to watch an unscripted show.

The record was previously held by TLC's Jon & Kate Plus 8, which claimed 10.6 million viewers back in 2009.

But with 6.3 million viewers in the coveted 18-49 age group, and a total increase of 37 per cent on the third season's premiere, Duck Dynasty's rise looks set to continue.

The show first aired in March 2012 and 
averaged 1.3 million viewers, according 
to data provided by Nielsen.

By the time the third series drew to a close an average of 8.4 million had tuned in.

According to Mr McKillop, part of the show's appeal lays in the clean living Christian values of the Robertson family, who live in the backwoods of West Monroe.

Their feet remain firmly on the ground, despite amassing a fortune from their duck sporting empire, Duck Commander.

The firm specialises in top-of-the-range duck calls and decoys, made from swamp wood, and employs many local people.

It was built by Phil Robertson - who turned down the opportunity to play professional football because it interfered with the duck season - with the help of his son Willie.

Part of their charismatic charm lies in their wish to stay grounded by keeping their guns and beards no matter how wealthy they become.

And while their arguments are often hilarious, they never swear.

Mr McKillop said: 'Hijinx is a word that I use to describe the kind of zeitgeist of their compound. But they represent some real values that people still cherish.'

Show stopper: Millions tuned in last week to watch Kay and Phil renew their wedding vows

Last Wednesday's fourth season opener 
saw Phil and Kay renew their wedding vows causing prompting 325,000 
tweets from love-sick fans. America's Got Talent recorded just 65,000.

It was all part of A&E's grand plan. The network has launched two new apps, Beard Booth and Endess Quack, in a bid to promote the show.

Mr McKillop added: 'Social has played a major role in getting the word out.

'It all helps generate buzz and what it does is it lifts it from a TV show to a part of American pop culture. Once you’re up there in that bastion of American pop culture, you’re on top.'
