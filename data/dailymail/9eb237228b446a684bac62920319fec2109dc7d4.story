She plans to celebrate her 60th birthday on Saturday with lavish Caribbean bash, with even her tennis coach and yoga teacher making it onto the coveted guest list.

Just don’t expect Carole Middleton’s only sibling, Gary Goldsmith, to be among those raising a toast to her good health on Mustique, one of the most exclusive islands in the Caribbean.

The Duchess of Cambridge’s shamed ‘Uncle G’, whose colourful lifestyle - including his self-confessed drugs use - has proved an embarrassment in recent years, is one of a number of Middleton family members who haven’t been invited to celebrate Carole’s big day.

Lavish: Mrs Middleton has planned an intimate gathering for 30 hand-picked guests at Villa Rocina in Mustique

While sources insist that Gary is ‘supremely chilled’ about the situation and wishes his sister well, locals on the island are agog at the apparent snub.

‘We don’t know why Gary has not been invited, particularly as he is her only sibling. You can only speculate really,’ said one source close to the family yesterday.

‘There’s not going to be any kind of party back at home either as we understand, so this really is the official birthday bash. It seems a shame that her closest relative won’t be there.’

It is understood that neither Pippa Middleton’s boyfriend, Nico Jackson, or Donna Air, currently dating Kate’s brother James, will be present at the weekend’s festivities either – although, naturally, Prince William will be.

‘It’s just a question of protocol really. It's a bit of a family lockdown as it always is when William and Kate are involved,’ said one well-placed source.

Instead the royal mother-in-law will celebrate with her husband and children – as well as the crème de la crème of Caribbean society.

The intimate gathering for 30 hand-picked guests reflects how far the fortunes of former air hostess Carole - and her genial husband Michael - have transformed over the last decade.

The middle-class family from Berkshire have become millionaires through their firm selling party goods on the internet.

Now they rub shoulders every winter on Mustique - made famous by the Queen’s sister, Princess Margaret, who used to own a villa there - with some of the richest (and most privileged) people in the world.

Carole, the Mail understands, will be holding her birthday soiree at Villa Rocina, the exquisite sea-view property they have taken over for their annual winter holiday this year.

The Oliver-Messel designed home, which boasts a 30 foot pool, gym and access to a private beach, is loved by the whole family, including Prince William and Kate, who flew out last week with their 18-month-old son, Prince George.

Confirmed names on the guest list, however, include many from the upper echelons of Mustique society such as Dr Mark Cecil and his wife Katie, both of whom were guests at William and Kate’s wedding.

The Old Harrovian hedge fund millionaire is, ironically, Nico Jackson’s boss, and has leant his own Mustique villa, Aurora, to the Cambridges before.

His food and interiors stylist wife Katie was a collaborator on Pippa's much-maligned first tome, Celebrate.

A source said: ‘Dr Mark has become a very good friend of the Middletons. It’s very incestuous like that on the island.’

Indeed, other guests include Jeanette Cadet from the Villa Rentals company on Mustique and Liz Saint from its Equestrian Centre, where Carole, in particular, is a keen rider.

Then there is Mustique’s resident doctor, Dr Michael Bunby, and his fashion designer wife Lotty ‘B’ (her clients include Jerry Hall and Liz Hurley), who have also become great friends of the Middletons and have been known to revel in the connection over dinner.

Another guest is Roger Pritchard, who is the managing director of The Mustique Company, and one of his predecessors, the Hon Brian Alexander, heir to the Earldom of Tunis.

The source said: ‘The Mustique Company is basically a small group of elite individuals who run the island. If you don't know them and they don't know you, you don't get to holiday there.’

Resident tennis pro, Richard Schaffer, has also secured an invite - all of the Middletons have a fearsome backhand - as well as yoga teacher Greg Allen (even William has been known to try one of his sun salutations).

And no party on Mustique would be complete without the greying but legendary Basil Charles, the owner of Basil’s Bar, who knew Princess Margaret and is apparently making ‘a bespoke champagne cocktail’ for Carole.

Lovable Irish rogue Brian Kinsella, the witty bar manager from the Middleton’s favourite London hotel, The Goring, is due to fly out this week to assist with drinks on the night.

He has created a special ‘mocktail’ for the non-drinkers present – which will no doubt include six-month-pregnant Kate – as well as offering Carole a cool glass of her favourite imported Chablis.

‘Apparently he’s concocted something heavenly, which he is calling Mother's Mocktail, from maple spice, passion fruit syrup, pineapple and ice,’ the source revealed.

‘The Middletons stayed at The Goring for the royal wedding it’s where they have many trusted friends.

‘But it's interesting that Carole has invited a staff member from the hotel when she hasn’t even invited her own brother.'

The five star hotel’s manager, Jeremy Goring, will also be on hand to cast his eagle eye over the proceedings, which includes a four-course dinner cooked by an in-house chef.

According to locals, the large tropical garden at Villa Rocina will be lit by torches for added atmosphere.

‘A lot of thought has been given by Carole into decorating the villa and garden for the night. It's going to be stunning,’ said one.

Absent: There will be several absences on the guest list for Saturday’s bash including Ms Middleton's brother Gary Goldsmith (right), Pippa's boyfriend Nico Jackson and son James's girlfriend Donna Air (together left)

Entertainment will be provided by a jazz band featuring singer Dana Gillespie, who is on the island to perform at Mustique’s annual Blues festival.

And sources say Carole has asked that instead of presents, each guest plant a sapling tree.

The source said: ‘There will be a short ceremony where the saplings get planted at the nearby Villa Aurora, owned by Mark Cecil. There is an amazing arboretum there.

‘The Middletons used to have a tree at the Villa Aurora but it died, so Carole thought it would be a lovely idea to have every invited guest planting a sapling on her birthday. She likes the continuity.’

Guests have been asked to leave their camera phones at home, as William and Kate will be present.

‘That’s one of the reasons that they are holding the party in a private villa rather than at Basil's bar. They do not want pictures coming out,’ the source said.

‘That said, it is extremely unlikely that anyone there would want to take one. It’s just not the done thing here.’

The source added: ‘The guest list alone shows how much the Middletons have made this island their own and the party is as much a thank you to the locals as a birthday celebration. No expense has been spared.

‘We find it interesting that Mustique is where the Middletons – including Kate and William - are now making their second home, just like Princess Margaret did.

‘It’s clearly the only place in the world they feel comfortable enough to completely relax.’
