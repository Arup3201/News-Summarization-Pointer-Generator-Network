Barometer readings at Twickenham are destined to soar off the scale today, as England attempt to cope with stifling, intensifying pressure while standing in the path of a thunderous South African juggernaut.

National coach Stuart Lancaster, his assistants and players are painfully aware that the stakes are rising as they engage in the second instalment of their QBE autumn Test series.

Saturday’s encounter represents the edge of an abyss. A fifth successive defeat would leave England in freefall, just when they need to be building towards next year’s World Cup.

Harsh it may be — given the calibre of the opposition during that period — but the worst losing run since 2006 would not convey the message that the tournament hosts are shaping up to mount a convincing challenge for the global prize.

There has long been a tangible sense of progress and upward mobility, but this regime needs further endorsement in the shape of another landmark result.

The management have been emphatically backed by their RFU employers, with contract extensions through to 2020, but they all know that judgment will be passed on the strength of what happens in the next 11 months. 

Lancaster spoke this week of the pressure faced by the coaches, with every decision increasingly dissected and scrutinised.

It is not just those four men who have to carry the burden, far from it, especially this week. 

In light of the allegations of homophobic abuse aimed at referee Nigel Owens last Saturday, there will be pressure on the sell-out crowd to be vocal but respectful.

And, following criticism by All Blacks coach Steve Hansen, there will be pressure on the hidden figures who edit footage for the stadium’s big screen, to avoid any home bias with their use of replays.

Away from south west London, there will be pressure on officials from the IRB and Samoan Rugby Union to confirm an agreement with their players to avert the threat of strike action disrupting next weekend’s Twickenham Test.

And Saturday’s contest will bring intense pressure on the Springboks too, after losing to Ireland. Their proud heritage does not permit the luxury of repeated failure, even with experimental team selections.

But the pressure will sit most heavily on England’s players — those men left standing amid an injury crisis, who must earn the victory demanded to put the Sweet Chariot back on a positive course. 

There are certain members of the Red Rose line-up particularly in need of an upturn in fortunes.

After naming his team for Saturday, Lancaster conceded that England’s kicking game must improve after the problems in that area last week.

So the onus is on Owen Farrell to rediscover the authority in his game after an injury-disrupted start to the season, while Danny Care must share the load and sharpen his execution in his 50th England match. 

There will be a different type of pressure on the pack as a unit.

They must maintain the superb set-piece standards of last week — especially in their line-out work — as they will be tested to the limit by the wily Springbok forwards. But in their breakdown work and ball- carrying, England must be several levels better, or they will be eclipsed and beaten. Lancaster has made it plain that two of his back- rowers are playing for their places. Tom Wood has been a stalwart and influential presence in this regime, but the blindside flanker has been told to ‘step up’ or face the threat of being replaced by James Haskell, the in-form Wasps captain.

Saracens No 8 Billy Vunipola has also been given a warning that his starting status is in danger.

Lancaster used both carrot and stick to make his point and the 22-year-old has expressed his determination to be more forceful.

Reflecting on his low-key contribution against the All Blacks, Vunipola said: ‘I felt that I didn’t impact the game as I would have wanted. I didn’t enforce my normal game. I felt I was quiet and I have definitely got to improve on that. I’ve just got to impose myself like I do at the club, and be who I am rather than tiptoeing round everything.’

Having been brought up by his Tongan family with an emphasis on respect and religion, Vunipola admitted he has to make character changes in order to improve as a player, adding: ‘It is tough because it is not in our culture to say, “Look, Mom, I am doing this”. You don’t impose yourself. You wait until you are spoken to as a kid. 

‘I’m not still a kid, but sometimes I have got too much respect for older guys in the team. I said that to Stuart. I’ve just got to get on with it and impose myself better and be like, “Give me the ball. I’ll do my best with it”. It is a lot to do with growing up fast. Hopefully, I will be better on Saturday. It is fair enough that people tell me I should be better. It is international rugby. I know I’ve got to be better.’

Vunipola is not alone in knowing that standards must be raised and maintained. Care said: ‘Like Stuart said, we need an extra 10 per cent from everyone — maybe 20 per cent.’

Each home player will hope to deliver that personal improvement, in the knowledge that next week’s clash with Samoa will serve as a time for experimentation, which may leave them vulnerable in the longer term. And as a team, England must end an unacceptably long run of submission to South Africa — 11 matches without a win — as the only way to lower the soaring barometer readings.
