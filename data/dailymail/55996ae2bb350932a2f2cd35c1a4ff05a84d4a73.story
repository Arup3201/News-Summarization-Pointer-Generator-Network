A hugely popular video game site that streams live video of people placing has been forced to implement a dress code banning naked users. 

Twitch, a service that lets users broadcast themselves playing games or watch others doing so, has banned 'wearing no clothing or sexually suggestive clothing' in posts on the site.

Gamers can be suspended from Twitch, which was recently bought by Amazon for $970m for nudity or broadcasting themselves wearing items 'including lingerie, swimsuits, pasties, and undergarments.'

San Francisco-based Twitch allows gamers to broadcast live streams of themselves playing videogames.

Its social networking features allow viewers to communicate with each other and the featured gamer during broadcasts.

The system works on PCs, consoles and mobile phones.

The company says more than 55 million gamers visit its site every month. 

'Nerds are sexy, and you're all magnificent, beautiful creatures, but let's try and keep this about the games, shall we?' reads a section titled 'Dress ... appropriately' in Twitch's new Rules of Conduct.

Under the new rules, gamers can be suspended from Twitch for nudity or broadcasting themselves wearing items 'including lingerie, swimsuits, pasties, and undergarments.'

The firm tries to make the ban as lighthearted as possible. 

'You may have a great six-pack, but that's better shared on the beach during a 2-on-2 volleyball game blasting 'Playing with the Boys,'' read the rules, with a link to the iconic scene of that nature from the movie 'Top Gun.'

'If it's unbearably hot where you are, and you happen to have your shirt off (gents) or a bikini top (ladies), then just crop the webcam to your face. If your lighting is hot, get fluorescent bulbs to reduce the heat. Xbox One Kinect doesn't zoom? Move it closer to you, or turn it off. There is always a workaround.'

It comes amid an online furore known as Gamergate. 

Beginning this summer, people involved in an online campaign dubbed "Gamergate" have been harassing several prominent women in the video game industry and their supporters for criticizing the lack of diversity and how women are portrayed in games. 

One of the targets is Brianna Wu, a software engineer and founder of game developer Giant Spacekat. Wu, who is in her mid-30s, said she has frequently been harassed online, but it's gotten worse this year.

Earlier this month, people threatened her and her husband with rape, death and castration on Twitter and posted her address online, she said, and they have been trying to impersonate her on the Internet to smear her reputation. 

She got so frightened that she left her home in Boston.

Wu went to the police, but most people harassed online don't. 

According to Pew, just 5 percent of those who were harassed reported the incident to law enforcement, while nearly half confronted the person online. Forty-four percent said they unfriended or blocked the person.

Most recently, actress Felicia Day, known for the gaming-oriented Web series 'The Guild,' had her email and real-world address posted online less than an hour after a blog post in which she criticized GamerGate. 

Day had written that she feared retribution when she decided to share her views on the movement.
