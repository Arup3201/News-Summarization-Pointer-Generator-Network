Phony: Charity Johnson, 34, was arrested last year after pretending to be a high school student for several months

A 34-year-old woman fooled her guardian and her entire high school last year when she pretended to be a 15 year old sophomore.

Charity Johnson spent about a month in jail for lying about her identity and age, and then quickly fled Longview, Texas when she was released in June.

But classmates and teachers at her tight-knit Christian school say they miss the woman they knew as teen Charity Stevens, and hope to reconnect.

'It's a small school, and the girls here that knew her actually liked her,' Principal Stuart Newlin told ABC.

'One of the girls just yesterday said, "I miss Charity." They've had three months to think about how she was much older than she said she was, and they still said that.'

New Life is a small school and last year had only 27 students. Newlin says the kids are close and that none of the teachers regret investing time in Johnson's education.

He says he has tried to contact Johnson, but no one in the community knows where she has gone to.

Johnson was arrested on the night of May 13 - more than six months after she enrolled in the school pretending to be an orphan.

According to school officials, Johnson came to New Life last October accompanied by a guardian who turned out to be younger than the fake tenth-grader.

During the enrollment process, Johnson gave the name Charity Stevens and indicated that she was 15 years old.

Tamica Lincoln, 30, who took on the role of Johnson's guardian last March, told the station KLTV that the bogus teenager told her that she had been abused by her biological father, who has since died along with her mother.

The two women met while working together at a McDonald's located inside the local Walmart, and Johnson confided in Lincoln that she had no place to stay after losing her parents.

Lincoln brought the suspected con artist four years her senior into her home 'as a child,' bought her clothes and did her hair. She even attended parent-teacher conferences to talk about the fake sophomore’s impressive academic performance.

'Young' love: During her year as a high-schooler, Johnson even started dating a local man, 23-year-old Rickie Williams (left), and told him she was 18 

'She acted like a kid. She did her homework. She got good report cards,' the 30-year-old Longview resident told ABC News.

She even started dating a local man, 23-year-old Rickie Williams - and told him she was 18.

Johnson’s web of lies began unraveling when Lincoln got a call from Obaseki, the head of the Dallas-based charity.

Ms Obaseki told Lincoln that she ran a background check on 'Charity Stevens,' which provided more questions than answers.

Lincoln then decided to make inquires of her own and called a manager at the McDonald's where both she and Johnson worked. The staffer pulled up the high-schooler's file, which indicated that her birth year was 1979 and her real name Charity Johnson.

On May 13, Lincoln and the phony orphan’s mentor, Ray Ward, alerted police to the alleged fraud before heading over to the high school.

School officials said Johnson came in last October as a home-schooled student without any prior transcripts.

Officers who responded to Lincoln’s Longview home asked Johnson to identify herself, and in response she gave them the name Charity Stevens – the same moniker used on her school application.

The woman was charged with failure to identify/giving false, fictitious information.

Looking at Johnson’s fake Facebook,Twitter and Instagram account created under the nickname Charite, it is easy to understand how those around her could have bought in to her tale of woes.

In the photos posted online, Johnson looks like a shy, fresh-faced girl with a pink bow in her neatly combed hair and sparkly manicure.

However, in her booking photo, Johnson dressed in a striped jail garb looks not a day younger than her 34 years, with a lined, puffy face and a tangle of hair.
