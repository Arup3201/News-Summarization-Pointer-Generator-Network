Sentenced: Nooshin Nedjah stabbed her cheating husband with a kitchen knife after sex

A jealous wife lured her cheating husband into bed and plunged a knife through his heart after they had sex.

Nooshin Nedjah, 30, became convinced that her husband Medi Sangachin had married someone else while he was visiting his family in Iran.

She told Mr Sangachin, 36, that she had a 'surprise' for him before the attack.

On Friday she was jailed for 11 years over the attack at the couple's flat in Leeds.

Mr Sangachin, 36, suffered massive blood loss after the kitchen knife entered his heart and only survived the attack thanks to the skill of one of the country's leading surgeons, Dr Patrick McGoldrick.

Nedjah was cleared of attempted murder after a trial at Leeds Crown Court, but was convicted of wounding with intent.

The jury heard the couple are both originally from Iran and married in June last year after starting a relationship in 2010 when they met on a bus.

They set up home at the first floor flat where neighbours got the impression they were not a happy couple.

In December last year Mr Sangachin visited his family in Iran. He told his wife he had been unfaithful to her and Nedjah became increasingly jealous as she believed he had remarried during his trip.

The court heard Nedjah persuaded her husband to come to bed on the afternoon of February 17 this year and they had sex.

Afterwards she told him she had a 'surprise' and told her husband to cover his eyes as they were naked in bed.

Jonathan Sharp, prosecuting, said: 'At that point she produced a sharp knife, which she had fetched from the kitchen, and plunged it with force into his chest, penetrating his heart and his left lung and narrowly missing the coronary artery.'

Nedjah was sentenced at Leeds Crown Court to 11 years in prison on Friday

Nedjah, who came to the UK to study English, initially failed to help her husband as blood pumped from the wound but eventually dialled 999.

Nedjah tried to claim her husband had inflicted the injury upon himself then said he was stabbed accidentally as the pair struggled.

Matthew Bean, for Nedjah, said his client had been receiving treatment for mental health problems.

The Recorder of Leeds, Judge Peter Collier, said: 'You lured him to have sex with you in order to get him into the position where you could strike him as you did.'
