A 22-year-old man accused of keeping an IED-style explosive device packed with ball bearings under his bed in Sydney's west was today denied bail.

Harley Roy Turnbull, 22, was arrested on Wednesday after his mother allegedly found a homemade bomb in his bedroom at their home in Werrington County on Tuesday night.

Bomb squad specialists examined the device before detonating it at a nearby football field. 

Turnbull was charged with possessing a prohibited weapon and possessing an explosive for unlawful purpose.

On Thursday, Turnbull appeared via audio visual link in Penrith Local Court where he was refused bail after an application by his lawyer, Brad Mallinson.

Turnbull was charged with possessing a prohibited weapon and possessing an explosive for unlawful purpose. 

In refusing bail, Magistrate Dorelle Pinch took into account previous failures by Turnbull to appear in court, his lengthy criminal record and the serious nature of the offence.

"There are no bail conditions that can mitigate these unacceptable risks and bail is refused," Ms Pinch told the court.

After the decision, Turnbull, sporting a shaved head and facial tattoos, swore at the magistrate before his audio visual link was turned off. 

The court heard Turnbull obtained the "improvised explosive device", allegedly containing 50 ball bearings, in a bag from a silver car outside his house, took the bag into his bedroom, and later left in the car.

The court was told Turnbull's mother later entered the bedroom, opened the bag, and called police.

The court heard that when shown a picture of the homemade bomb in an interview with police after his arrest, Turnbull said the device "looked cool" and "could be a bunger".

In arguing for bail, Mr Mallinson said his client didn't know "what he was in possession of" and that there would be "huge delays" before the case next came to court because forensic evidence needed to be collected.

Police prosecutor Ben Seabury said he held "grave concerns" for the community if Turnbull was released, describing the possible injuries sustained if the device had exploded as "catastrophic".

He said the device had the potential to "kill or maim", adding that "50 ball bearings would have caused major damage".

The matter returns to Parramatta Local Court on February 27.
