A workman watched his van go up smoke after his e-cigarette exploded while charging in the vehicle's cab.

The Ford Transit was wrecked in a blaze on the driveway of a house in Rotherham on Friday morning.

The vehicle's owner, kitchen fitter Garry Brookes, 48, said the blaze had done £23,000-worth of damage to the vehicle and the fire was so intense it even melted the front door of his customer's home.

A van in Rotherham went up in smoke last week after the driver left an e-cigarette charging on the front seat

Kitchen fitter Garry Brookes, 48, said the blaze had caused around £23,000 worth of damage to his vehicle

Father-of-two Mr Brookes plugged his e-cigarette in to his van after it ran out of battery - but just an hour later he watched in horror as his van burst into a ball of flames.

He said: 'It was on a customer's drive and it had been there for about an hour when I just went to pack things up.

'I noticed there was smoke and I was running round and noticed all my paperwork was on fire. I just looked and my charger was plugged in and I saw the back end had blown out.

'I tried to put the fire out and the customer was bringing buckets of water and a hose pipe.'

The labourer has now been left with a shell of a van - with an estimated £23,000 worth of damage.

Mr Brookes said: 'Within ten minutes the van was burnt out and was just a shell on four wheels. You wouldn't believe the damage it caused.

'It melted my customer's front door which was about six feet away from the van. I was amazed how quick it went.

'The next door neighbour saw what was happening and drove his expensive car off his drive, which was lucky because that would have gone up too.' 

Mr Brookes had left an e-cigarette to charge in the van, but the device is thought to have exploded

After realising it was too late to save his van, Mr Brookes tried to salvage his tools. He said: 'Once I knew I couldn't save the van I thought "my tools, my livelihood".

'I was dragging things out of the back while it was still on fire. It was stupid getting in the back of the van when it was on fire but it was my livelihood.'

Mr Brookes opted to smoke electronic cigarettes five months ago when he heard the news that his girlfriend's daughter was having a baby.

He said: 'I started off with a £10 e-cig from my corner shop. Then when I thought these are good, I went to buy a good one.

'It was £39.99 and I always charged it in the van or in the house. I'm just glad that it didn't happen when I was driving because I wouldn't be walking now.

'It could have happened in the house when my kids were there and I'm just so thankful that it didn't.'

The blaze lasted for close to half an hour before fire services were finally able to put it out.

The Ford Transit was written off by the blaze, which laid waste to the engine and burnt through the cab

The heat of the fire was so intense that it even melted his customer's front door, six feet from the blazing van

Mr Brookes added: 'It was a proper bonfire when the fire service got there. It felt like a lifetime and I had to watch it happen.

'It's been the worst time of my life. It's this e-cig that's caused this mayhem and somebody should be liable. Now when I see people smoking e-cigarettes I tell them to put them in the bin.'

Following the fire, and on the day the first TV adverts for e-cigarettes went on air, fire chiefs in South Yorkshire issued tips on the safe charging of the devices.

Head of community safety for the service Kevin Ronan said: 'Fires caused by e-cigarettes are an emerging trend which, two years ago, simply did not exist.

'Whilst e-cigs may offer a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes, they are so popular now we do need to make sure people know how charge them safely.

'The advice for e-cigs is really the same as for many smaller electrical appliances like mobile phones and laptops - don't be tempted to buy cheap unbranded chargers, don't leave them to charge whilst you are out of the house or asleep and keep them well away from flammable materials.'

The safety warning was released on the day the first advert for e-cigarettes was due to hit UK TV screens

Mr Ronan said fire investigators think fires start because e-cigarettes are left to charge too long, they are charged too close to soft furnishings or because the charger itself is faulty.

Recent figures reveal electronic cigarettes have been linked to more than 100 fires.

Fire services in the UK are now attending at least one blaze involving the devices each week, statistics suggest.

They have attended dozens of incidents suspected to have been sparked by e-cigarettes or related equipment including chargers in less than three years. 

Firefighters have told e-cigarette users to:

 - Charge the device on a flat, solid and stable surface, such as a kitchen worktop;

 - Keep the device away from flammable or combustible materials when charging;

 - Never leave the device on a bed or close to soft furnishings, or in a cluttered space;

 - Don’t exceed the recommended charging time, or leave unattended for any significant length of time e.g. overnight while you’re asleep, or if you go out;

 - Don’t buy cheap, unbranded chargers and always follow the manufacturer’s instructions.
