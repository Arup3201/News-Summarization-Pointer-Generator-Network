Two men have been charged with murder after allegedly shooting a man they had trapped with a Craigslist advert.

Ryan Roth, 17, and Markell Thomas, 18, were arrested last week after Rene Balbuena was shot dead in front of his 15-year-old son in Los Angeles.

The pair were also charged with robbery and attempted murder after wounding Mr Balbuena's teenage son.

They are believed to have been members of an Inglewood gang, according to police.

Mr Balbuena's family have since thanked detectives for arresting his alleged killers.

Mr Balbuena, 41, had answered a Craigslist posting advertising a $300 Samsung Galaxy, driving to South Los Angeles with his son to buy it.

He texted the supposed seller when he arrived and two men approached his car from behind.

According
to police, Markell Thomas allegedly jumped in the back seat of the car 
and threatened Mr Balbuena's son with a gun, with both men said to have 
demanded money.

But Roth, who was charged as an adult 
despite his age, is said to have shot Mr Balbuena several times when he 
got out of the car.

His son suffered minor injuries in the incident and the robbers fled the scene empty handed.

Sandra Balbuena, 19, told a news 
conference: 'My dad is my best friend. He was everything to me and 
nothing's going to bring him back.

nothing's going to bring him back.'

'I'm very proud to live in a city that I know that I'm safe, and that no one else is going to get harmed,' she said.

'I
know nothing's going to bring back my dad, but I know that they worked 
real hard, I know they didn't sleep, I know they didn't eat.'

Detectives have since revealed that seven similar hold ups have taken place since early August in the Baldwin Hills area of Los Angeles.

Thomas could face additional charges in relation to those robberies, according to prosecutors.

A gun was found in Roth's backpack when he was arrested, said police, but it was not the murder weapon.

Both men are due to appear in court next month.
