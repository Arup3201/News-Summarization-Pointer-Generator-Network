Football fans continue to be squeezed for every penny by inflation-busting ticket price rises, a survey into the staggering cost of following your team has revealed.

The cheapest match-day ticket price across the top four divisions of English football has increased by an average of 4.4 per cent over the last 12 months — nearly three times the rate of inflation.

The BBC Price of Football survey finds Arsenal have the highest adult match day ticket price at £97, though this is a reduction from £126 last season.

The cheapest season ticket in the Premier League is £299 at champions Manchester City, while the lowest match day admission is £15 at Newcastle United.

Fans' groups expressed dismay at the spiralling cost of watching the game.

Malcolm Clarke, chairman of the Football Supporters’ Federation, said: ‘At the top of the game there is no excuse for prices to be rising higher than inflation. The prices should really be going down.’

The BBC survey found that the average price of the cheapest adult ticket across English football has risen at almost twice the rate of the cost of living since 2011.  

While the cost of living has increased by 6.8 per cent in that time, the price of the cheapest matchday ticket in the top four divisions rose by 13 per cent.

Premier League fans have seen ticket prices go up by 15.8 per cent in the last three seasons but they are by no means the only ones to suffer. Prices in League One have jumped 31.7 per cent and League Two by 19 per cent in this time. But the average price in the Championship has gone down by 3.2 per cent. 

Buying food and drink at football grounds adds to the high cost of following a team

An Arsenal spokesman said: ‘Work is continually undertaken to offer tickets at various prices, with the highest match ticket only applicable for five Premier League fixtures in a season.

‘Across the course of a campaign we offer up to 300,000 reduced price tickets to adult and junior supporters from £5 and £10.’ 

Despite the often high prices, the Premier League said its stadia had been 95.3 per cent full this season.

Premier League head of supporter services Cathy Long said: 'For the Premier League and our clubs keeping the grounds as full as possible is our top priority. The attendances so far this season are very encouraging, with more than 95 per cent of seats sold and average crowds tracking with last season’s which were the highest in English top flight football since 1949-50.

'This only happens because of the commitment of attending fans and the hard work put in by our clubs to fill their stadiums with a variety of offers, both of which led to a 3 per cent increase in season ticket sales and a 2.8 per cent rise in away attendance last season.

'We recognise that certain matches can be more challenging to attend than others but are encouraged to see clubs, through their commitment to the Away Supporter Initiative, make everything from ticket price reductions to special travel offers and reciprocal pricing deals available to their travelling fans.'
