Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has claimed that the Australian public supports a military campaign against Islamic State, as Australian fighter jets prepare to head to Iraq.

Ms Bishop labelled the 'murderous terrorist organisation' as a threat not only to the Middle East but to Australia and the rest of the world, during the the United Nations Security Council in early September.

'The international community cannot with any conscience turn away,' she said.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has claimed that the Australian public supports a military campaign against Islamic State, as Australian fighter jets prepare to head to Iraq.

On Saturday, the foreign minister said that sending Australian armed forces overseas 'is one of the most significant and serious decisions that any government can make,'

'We have considered it from every angle, and considered every option, and we know that Australia’s national security is at risk,' Ms Bishop told The Sunday Times in Busselton in Western Australia.

'ISIS and similar organisations are not only threatening the people of Iraq and beyond, but Australia,' she said. 

'There have been a number of videos where Australia has specifically been mentioned as a terrorist target.'

'I believe the Australian people understand the threat, and support the Australian Government doing all it can to keep them safe.' 

The foreign minister's comment follow the revelation that Australia's super hornet fighter jets are heading to the Middle East.

In the past few days F/A 18 jets were employed in non combat reconnaissance and intelligence operations in Iraq The Sunday Telegraph reported.  

'We have considered it from every angle, and considered every option, and we know that Australia’s national security is at risk,' said Ms Bishop

The deployment of the Air Task Group will be the largest sent out from Australia since the Vietnam War, joining aircraft and tanker transport already operating in Iraq.

The super hornet jets have returned to base in Dubai, and air strikes are anticipated to begin as early as Sunday evening.

A Galaxy poll revealed that 62% of Australian voters are in favour of the Federal government's decision to begin air strikes in Iraq against Islamic State.

A Galaxy poll revealed that 62% of Australian voters are in favour of the Federal government's decision to begin air strikes in Iraq against Islamic State.

A further three quarters of voters also believe that the threat of a terrorism attack on Australian soil is real. 

Ms Bishop reinforced the findings of the poll as she addressed security concerns on Saturday.

Security and intelligence agencies were 'concerned that a terrorist attack could take place' within Australia, said Ms Bishop.

'They are not saying that one is imminent but they are saying Australia is a target,'

'ISIS and similar organisations are opposed to open, tolerant and free societies.'

'The Government has a plan to keep Australia safe,' said Prime Minister Tony Abbott

'Australia represents what they oppose and they try to eliminate any opposition to their crazy and murderous ideology.'

Ms Bishop encouraged Australians to continue their lives and to be 'pragmatic'. 

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott reassured the public that in uncertain times, the government would do 'everything possible to keep you safe,' reported The Daily Telegraph.

'Our security measures at home and abroad are directed against terrorism, not religion,' he said.

'As Australians we should always live normally because terrorists’ goal is to scare us out of being ourselves,'

'The Government has a plan to keep Australia safe.'
