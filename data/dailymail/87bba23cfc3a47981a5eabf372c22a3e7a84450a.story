Accused: Former Sun editor Rebekah Brooks, arriving at the Old Bailey today

A decorated Army major is suspected of selling a picture of Prince William in a bikini to a newspaper, a court heard yesterday.

Major Alex McKay, awarded an MBE for his work on London’s Olympic security, was Prince William’s platoon commander at Sandhurst when the royal attended a James Bond-themed party there.

The Old Bailey heard yesterday that former Sun editor Rebekah Brooks approved an illegal £4,000 payment for the picture of the Prince posing as a Bond girl in a green bikini.

The 45-year-old was told the exclusive picture came from a reporter’s ‘best contact at Sandhurst’ who wanted the cash to pay for his wife to go on a course, it is alleged.

The embarrassing photo was taken at a 007-themed party held in the cricket pavilion of the military academy, but was never published.

Kate Middleton also attended the fancy-dress party and was said to have worn a wetsuit.

The reporter sent an email saying the picture belonged to Prince William’s direct platoon commander where the Royal was training in 2006, the court heard.

When Brooks was asked by email: ‘What do you think boss?’, she replied ten minutes later saying: ‘OK’.

The court has been showed paperwork from The Sun showing a £4,000 payment was made on June 16, 2006, with the reference: ‘Prince William bikini exclusive’.

But a story linked to this alleged payment did not appear until September 9, 2006, accompanied with a crude mock-up of the Prince’s face on a man’s bikini clad body.

The story read: ‘Prince William caused a stir at a Sandhurst 007 bash by dressing as a Bond girl’ and also revealed his then-girlfriend Kate Middleton attended the party dressed in a wetsuit as James Bond and brandishing a toy gun.

A war hero friend of the Prince, Major Alexis Roberts, who was killed in battle in Afghanistan in 2007 was initially suspected of leaking the embarrassing picture of the young Royal, the court heard.

However, the focus shifted to a second Sandhurst platoon commander, Alex McKay, who is now suspected of taking the photo.

The email exchange which was forwarded to Brooks was read out in full to the jury this morning.

The reporter wrote: ‘My best contact at Sandhurst who has provided a string great stuff over a period of months, offered us a picture of William at a James Bond party dressed as a Bond girl.

‘He is wearing a bikini and an open Hawaian shirt.

‘He is an instructor at Sandhurst and the picture in question belongs to a fellow instructor who is very concerned by the idea of the snap ending up in The Sun.

‘He also happens to be William’s direct platoon commander.’

The email revealed the person offering
the photo wanted ‘£4,000 up front’ and wanted the story to run during 
the Sandhurst summer holidays.

The reporter said: ‘I have the guy with the picture over a barrel because I know his identity.

‘The chap is only happy for us to use the picture once, when Sandhurst is on a break, and wants the money upfront by Saturday.

‘The reason he needs the cash to pay for a course his wife is going on.

‘If he can’t get it from us, he will simply take out a loan.’

Prince William and girlfriend Kate both attended the 007-themed party at the military academy

Paddy Harverson, the spokesman for Prince William, told the jury he spoke to Brooks a month before the story appeared and asked her not to use the bikini picture.

‘It was Prince William in a bikini with a pink feather boa’, he recalled.

‘My feeling was the photo had been taken on a private occasion and it shouldn’t be published.

‘It was a private photo and shouldn’t be published without the Prince’s permission.’

Mr Harverson, who was employed as the communication secretary to Prince Charles, said Brooks had suggested the pictures would be printed the following day, in August 2006.

He said when the story finally appeared, he noted: ‘It was interesting to see they didn’t publish the photo.’

Major Julia Parke-Robinson was a platoon commander at Sandhurst in the Blenheim company that included Prince William, then known as Cadet Wales.

She was at the party in April 2006 with around 90 cadets, their partners, and staff.

She told the court William brought his then-girlfriend Kate MIddleton to the party, which was used as a training exercise to assess cadets’ organisation skills.

‘I can remember Cadet Wales wearing a Bond girl style outfit, with a bikini top and grass skirt, as were a number of his friends’, she said.

‘I have no recollection of what Kate Middleton was wearing at the time.’

Quizzed on the colour of William’s bikini, she said: ‘I recall it was green.’

Prince William was in the 12th platoon headed by Alex McKay, the court heard.

Major Parke-Robinson said she received a briefing on dealings with the press when she moved to the company in January 2006

She said cadets did not have access to the internet during their time at Sandhurst, and she was not sure how widespread social media use was.

She said there was no official photographer at the party, but added: ‘Cadets take photographs throughout their training, so I believe photos would have been taken during the party.

The court also heard that Brooks repeatedly approved via email what the reporter described as 'good value for money' payments ranging between £500 and £4,500 to his source.

Although he did not refer to her by name in the emails, the court heard that money was paid to Ministry of Defence press officer Bettina Jordan-Barber.

Jordan-Barber, who was employed by the MoD since 1997 and had a high level of security clearance, received a total of £100,000 for information she provided to The Sun, the jury was told.

Brooks is on trial with Andy Coulson, 45, news editor Ian Edmondson, 44, and managing editor Stuart Kuttner, 73, for carrying out an alleged a six year phone hacking campaign at the News of the World.

Royal editor Clive Goodman, 56, is also in the dock accused with Coulson of misconduct in public office.

Brooks is then accused of masterminding a cover-up of phone hacking with husband Charles, 50, News International head of security Mark Hanna, 50, and PA Cheryl Carter, 49, when she knew she was about to be arrested.

Rebekah Brooks, of Jubilee Barn, Churchill, Chipping Norton, Coulson, of Hart Hill, Charing, Kent, Edmondson, of Blenheim Road, Raynes Park, south London, and Kuttner, of Broomhill Walk, Woodford Green, Essex all deny of one count of conspiracy to intercept communications.

Brooks also denies two counts of perverting the course of justice and two counts of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office.

Coulson, with Clive Goodman, of Woodham Lane, Woodham, Addlestone, Surrey, also denies two counts of misconduct in a public office.

Carter, of Mildmay Road, Chelmsford, Essex, Hanna, of Glynswood Road, Buckingham, Bucks, and Charles Brooks, of Jubilee Barn, Churchill, Chipping Norton all deny conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

The trial was adjourned until Monday and the case continues.
