These pictures prove that it is not only humans that enjoy a rich and varied diet.

Hidden cameras captured these remarkable images among the treetops of sea eagles dining on lamb, rabbit, fish and even a gosling. 

As part of the Forestry Commission project nearly 7,000 covert images were taken of the nest in Argyll on the west coast of Scotland during the 2014 breeding season. 

Despite their name, the birds of prey feasted on only seven fish during the seven month period, but brought back a total of nine lambs  for dinner.

The sea eagles brought 117 prey items back to the nest between January and July.

After looking at thousands of photographs it was confirmed that the sea eagles returned to their nest with 117 prey items between January and July.

Analysis confirmed that 67 items were unidentifiable, 21 were mammals, 14 were birds, seven were fish, and  up to nine were lambs.

The Scottish sea eagles were close to extinction in the late 19th and early 20th century, but following a reintroduction programme in 1975 there are now thought to be more than 80 breeding pairs. 

The research appears to confirm farmers' concerns about the extent to which sea eagles are preying on lambs. 

In 2008 farmers on the Gairloch peninsula, in the Scottish Highlands, claimed 200 lambs were taken in just one season.

But conservationists have insisted sea eagles preying in lambs in a rare occurrence.

The findings were revealed at the first meeting of the sea eagle stakeholder group, which was set up after repeated complaints about the birds from farmers.

Lachie Maclean, interim chair of the group, said: 'This is a useful piece of research which will help feed into the wider discussions about managing sea eagles in our area.

'The survey gives us a better idea of when lambs are more likely to be part of sea eagles' diets.' 

The hidden cameras were disguised under a piece of pre-prepared bark and rubbed with mud. 

A spokesman for the Forestry Commission Scotland, which led the undercover camera project, said he believed it was the first time images like these have ever been taken in Scotland.
