Galatasaray and Besiktas fans clashed ahead of Saturday's derby match, with chairs and punches being thrown in running battles in Turkey.

The violence came just days before Chelsea are set to play Galatasaray in the last 16 of the Champions League, with travelling fans advised by their club to exercise caution while in Istanbul.

A video posted on YouTube sees mobs of Galatasaray and Besiktas hooligans fighting in a busy shopping street just before the match at the Turk Telekom Arena.

Rampage: The attack continues before police officers step in and restore order

One group is pinned inside a cafe, with rival fans hurling plastic chairs at them before police officers eventually restored order.

Besiktas supporters can be seen goading their rivals further down the street after the attack.

The trouble continued during the match, which Galatasaray won 1-0.

When their midfielder Felipe Melo was sent off for a rash two-footed tackle in the closing stages, furious Besiktas fans invaded the pitch and clashed with riot police.

A penalty from Selcuk Inan after 38 
minutes decided the match, with Galatasaray leapfrogging their rivals 
into second place in the Super Lig, three points behind leaders 
Fenerbahce.

In their last meeting back in September, the players had to run back to the dressing rooms after fans invaded the pitch when Melo was again sent off.

Melo was struck by a bottle as he walked off the field and police had to use tear gas to disperse the crowds.Â 

Chelsea have issued advice to their fans 
planning to travel to the first leg tie on Wednesday night, saying it is
 not safe to use to Metro to reach the stadium and to use the special 
coaches laid on instead.

There is a history of violence involving Turkish and English fans in the city. Prior to a 2000 UEFA Cup semi-final two Leeds United fans, Christopher Loftus and Kevin Speight, were stabbed to death.

In 1993, more than 200 Manchester United fans were arrested and many more denied entry to the stadium before a Champions League tie at Galatasaray's old stadium, the Ali Sami Yen.

United were greeted by Galatasaray fans waving 'Welcome to Hell' banners when they arrived in the City for the match and Eric Cantona was hit by a police officer after he was sent off.
