BT was accused yesterday of introducing ‘immoral’ and ‘money-grabbing’ price rises that will lead to millions of customers being charged for the 1571 messaging service for the first time.

The telecoms giant has introduced landline, broadband and service charges that are expected to generate £245million a year.

Most controversially, BT’s 10million customers will have to pay an extra £1.75 a month for the previously free 1571 voicemail service, which allows callers to leave a message.

Individuals must contact the firm to opt out if they do not want to pay for the service.

Monthly phone and broadband packages have gone up by 6.5 per cent, with standard line rental up by 44p or an above-inflation 3.5 per cent to £15.99 a month.

BT denies the rises are an attempt to recoup its recent £2.4billion investment in sport broadcasting, including Champions League and Premier League football matches.

But David Hickson, of the Fair Telecoms Campaign, said charging customers for a previously free 1571 service was ‘money-grabbing nastiness’ and it was ‘obvious’ that ordinary people were now paying for BT Sport.

‘BT will deny it but the timing seems unfortunate,’ he added. ‘Dipping into areas which BT previously felt should be free of charge customers suggests they are desperate to recoup cash.’

Paul Green, a spokesman for Saga, said the rises would hit pensioners and the vulnerable, who rely on landlines, hardest.

‘It is immoral for BT to charge customers for the 1571 service they haven’t purposely asked for and have to opt out of,’ he said.

‘Putting up standing charges will hit elderly customers particularly hard. Older, more vulnerable customers perhaps don’t make as many calls, but those they do make are vital to their social interaction or are made in an emergency. For them, having a landline is also a lifeline.’ 

He said many older people were on fixed monthly incomes from pensions and savings, which have been hit by low interest rates, and even small rises in bills had a big impact on their finances.
