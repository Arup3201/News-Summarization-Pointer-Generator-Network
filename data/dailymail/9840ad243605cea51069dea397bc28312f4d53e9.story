Victim: Nikki Allan was killed just yards from her home in Sunderland in 1992

Police have arrested a 43-year-old man on suspicion of murdering a seven-year-old girl more than twenty years ago.

Officers from Northumbria Police said the man was taken into custody this morning over the death of Nikki Allan, who was found dead in Sunderland in 1992.

He is currently being questioned by police.

Nikki was found after a brutal attack where she was, beaten with a brick stabbed 37 times.

The young girl had vanished after leaving her grandparents’ flat, in Wear Garth, to walk to her home, just 150 yards away.

Her shoes were discovered outside the Old Exchange building a few hundred yards away the next morning.

Her body was found inside the building by a neighbour helping police with the search.

An investigation has been open ever since.

A number of people were arrested in connection with the killing, but no one was convicted.

Police say new information leading to today's was given to police after a BBC Crimewatch reconstruction of her last movements.

Ahead of the programme, Detective
 Superintendent Ford said: 'This was an extremely brutal attack on a 
defenceless seven-year-old girl and 21 years after it happened it’s 
still talked about in Sunderland and the local area.

'Nikki’s family have been left devastated by what happened and we will never give up trying to find her killer.

'Technology
 and forensic investigation techniques are improving all of the time and
 it’s our hope that these advances along with new information from the 
public could lead to us finding out who murdered her.'

A spokesman said officers: 'are particularly keen to speak to anyone who lived in the Wear Garth area at the time of the murder or anyone who hung around or inside the Old Exchange Building.'

Nikki's mother Sharon Henderson, 47, today spoke of her shock after finding out about the arrest.

Ms Henderson has campaigned for years to get justice for her daughter and was visited by officers earlier today with the news.

She received word of the arrest in hospital today, where she is recovering from a collapse which doctors say may be linked to the stress of her campaign.

She said: 'I am just in total shock, I can't believe it. Everything I have worked towards in the past two decades has finally materialised.

'It makes all the stress, all the campaigning worth while. But the news still hasn't sunk in, and I don't know who has been arrested.

'When the police arrived at the hospital to deliver the news I assumed they had come to check I was OK. I couldn't believe my ears when I heard the news. I just feel overwhelmed with emotion.'

'This is what I have been hoping for all these years. I hope that Nikki is finally getting the justice she deserves. I am waiting for the police to tell me who the suspect is.'

Sources have also said that the arrested man was not George Heron, who was cleared of her murder after a trial in 1993.

Mr Heron was acquitted despite apparently making a confession after a judge ruled he had been dealt with oppressively by police.

Nikki's mother Sharon Henderson subsequently won a civil claim against him, and he was ordered to pay her £7,000.

Anyone who thinks they have any information that could help detectives with their inquiries is asked to contact police on 101 ext 69191.
