Swedish home furnishings giant Ikea hired translators to check the names of 9,000 of its products - to make sure they didn't mean something rude in Thai.

The Wall Street Journal reports that the retail chain spent nearly four years on the project to spare the blushes of its South-East Asian clients.

And for good reason.

Embarrasing: Ikea hired a team of linguists to check their catalog to make sure their home furnishings didn't mean something rude in Thai

The Journal found that 'Redalen' the name of an Ikea bed, 'sounds uncomfortably close to getting to third base in Thailand,' and 'Jattebra' - a grey plant pot - 'could sound like slang for sex'.

After realising the embarrassing blunder Ikea hired a team of linguists to make sure that items from its catalog are appropriate when translated from Swedish to Thai.

Confectionery retailer Kraft on the 
other hand didn't seem to have the same due diligence when researching 
Mondelez International, the new name for its global snack foods brand.

And were left rather red faced when it emerged that the word sounded like oral sex in Russian.

Ikea was founded in 1943 in Sweden by 17-year-old Ingvar Kamprad.

The first UK store opened in 1987 and Brits fell in love with its reasonably priced home furnishings and ready-to-assemble furniture.

Hailed as the world's most successful mass-market retailer the chain now has 230 stores in 33 countries and hosts a whopping 410 million shoppers per year. 

But although it's easy to see the appeal of not many would go as far as Julie 'Bunny' Rodgers and Willie 'Bear' Pittman who got married at their local branch this year.

Two years after they met at the store in Maryland, US, the happy couple decided their favourite shop was the perfect venue  their nuptials.

Bizarrely the racy translation didn't deter shareholders, who last month voted overwhelmingly to adopt the name.

Other companies have learned the hard way to take precautions.

According to The Huffington Post luxury car manufacturer Bugatti once described a car as being available in the color 'rape yellow.'

The mixup was the result of a French to English translation error of 'rapeseed plant.'Similarly, according to the BBC, General Motors was forced to change the name of the Buick LaCrosse sedan in Canada when it came to light that 'LaCrosse' is slang for masturbation in Quebec.And in Germany, 'vicks' can be a term for sex, so Vicks cough drops are called Wicks in Germany, according to the Toronto Star.
