Ten-year-old Toby Lee has amassed a fan-base any modern rock star would be proud of, with more than 1.4million people having watched his performance online

Within days of the clip being shared online, hundreds of thousands of people had viewed it - with countless more sharing it on social media. 

By January 29, more than 1.4million people from around the world had pressed play. 

Far from letting his new-found fame go to his head, 10-year-old Toby said there was still room for improvement. 

'I'd give my guitar playing 9.5 out of 10 because no one is perfect.

'I play the blues and rock and roll but I don't sing, I really hate singing.' 

Among Toby's fans in the music world is blues legend Bernie Marsden and Mick Box, lead guitarist of Uriah Heep. 

The talented took an interest in music from a young age, picking up the ukulele aged four.  

'I got the ukulele when I was four and started to play the guitar when I was six.

The schoolboy said he was surprised by the number of people who had viewed his clips online

'I'm not sure where liking rock came from, but I listen to it all the time now and my mum and dad quite like it.

'I just love playing and when we put the videos up on Facebook I thought they would have about ten people look at them.

'When I found out more than a million people had seen it, that was a surprise.' 

Toby's father, Terry Lee, said he is 'delighted' his son has gained so many fans at such a young age. 

'Toby's always been very passionate about the guitar. He's always strumming in the back of the car on his way to school,' said Mr Lee, a photographer.

'I shot a few videos of him playing at home and put them on Facebook and within a few days over a million people had watched them including people in America.

'He's only ten but is already getting fan mail. It's amazing and we're delighted his music is being appreciated by so many people.'
