With their glamorous lifestyles and love of fashion, Nadine, Alice and Farah Abdel Aziz have long been touted as Lebanon's answer to the Kardashians.

And now just like Kim, Kourtney and Khloe, the sisters are set to star in their very own reality TV show charting their daily lives in Beirut.

Lebanese TV station LBC has announced they will launch the fly-on-the-wall programme called The Sisters, which will see them living out their lives in front of the cameras.
