A mother-of-five nearly died after paramedics misdiagnosed two brain haemorrhages as a virus.

Anita Trewick, 42, was in agony with excruciating headaches and regular black-outs but 999 crews dismissed the serious bleeds on the brain as sinusitis.

But two sets of paramedics who were called to the teaching assistant’s home on December 16 and 18 both failed to spot the tell-tale signs of the deadly condition.

Anita Trewick and her husband, Dean, were twice told by paramedics that she was suffering from a virus when, in fact, she had had two brain haemorrhages

And despite her first-aid trained husband Dean, 50, telling medics he feared it might be a stroke or blood clot, she was left at home and prescribed painkillers.

When she was finally diagnosed on December 19 with the life-threatening haemorrhages, doctors had to battle to save her life in an emergency six-hour operation.

Miraculously, she survived and is recovering at home in Welton le Marsh, Lincolnshire.

The furious couple are now demanding an apology from East Midlands Ambulance Service who confirmed they are investigating the matter. 

Mrs Trewick has criticised the paramedics who left her a ‘ticking time-bomb’ and accused them of ‘leaving her to die’.

She said: ‘It was an awful time in my life, I was in agony - I thought my head was going to explode, it was that painful.

Mrs Trewick (pictured with her husband before her illness) called paramedics on December 16 and December 18 when she suffered excruciating headaches. Both times she was left at home with painkillers

‘I knew something was wrong, but you have to listen to the paramedics when they give you the answers.

‘It
 has been horrific not just for me but for my family and friends, I was 
scared and didn’t know what was going to happen to me.

A brain haemorrhage is bleeding in or around the brain.

It can be caused by a head injury but can also happen spontaneously as a result of a ruptured aneurysm.

Symptoms include a sudden, very severe headache, vomiting, fits, loss of consciousness and sudden death.

A brain haemorrhage is a medical emergency which requires immediate treatment.

The two treatment options are using medication to prevent further bleeding, and surgery to repair the source of the bleeding.

Haemorrhages most often occur as the result of a brain aneurysm bursting - a brain aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel caused by a weakness in the blood vessel's wall.

People who smoke, drink heavily, have poorly controlled high blood pressure or who have a family history of aneurysms are most at risk.

About 65 per cent of brain haemorrhage patients survive but many find their recovery slow and frustrating.

About 9,000 people in the UK have a brain haemorrhage every year.

Four out of five patients are aged between 40 and 65. They are more common in women than men.

‘Day to day life is hard, although I am trying to get back to full health and hopefully be who I used to be, but it will be a long road.

‘I am very disappointed with the East Midlands Ambulance Service and definitely feel they could have done more. I was just hours from dying.

‘They gave me a death sentence and I want changes to be made and I don’t want this happening to anyone else.

‘No family should have to go through what my family have had to endure in these past few weeks.

‘I am just glad to be here and feel so lucky that I am alive and with my children and husband again.’

Mrs
 Trewick suffered the first haemorrhage on December 16 and the second on
 December 18 - but on both occasions paramedics failed to spot the 
deadly bleed on the brain.

Her GP finally sent her to Boston Pilgrim Hospital on December 19 where she was diagnosed.

She was then taken to Nottingham’s Queen’s Medical Centre where she underwent a gruelling operation to save her life.

From her hospital bed she even sent text messages telling her husband that she feared she was going to die.

One read: ‘I am frightened and scared and don’t know the outcome.’

Mr
 Trewick, an operations manager, added: ‘It was horrific - I thought, 
how can I tell our five boys what has happened to their mum and that she
 might die.

‘Lots of different things were flooding through my mind, she is the engine of the family, I don’t know what we’d do without her.

On December 19 Mrs Trewick went to her GP who was so concerned about her health that she was sent straight to hospital where she was diagnosed and had a six-hour emergency operation to save her life

‘It was pure fight how she pulled through, no-one knows medically how she managed it, it truly is a miracle.

‘The
 nurses in the hospital nicknamed her Wonder Woman and a few people have
 been putting that in her get well soon cards, it has stuck and it is a 
fitting nickname.

Mrs Trewick has now been released from hospital but she is still struggling to walk and talk normally

‘However, I am absolutely furious with the East Midlands Ambulance Service. I am no professional, far from it, but you can Google the symptoms she was suffering from and it comes back with meningitis or a haemorrhage.

‘Out of five medical professionals none of them managed to work out what was wrong with her and I think that is wrong.

‘The thing that makes matters worse is they were telling me to just give her strong painkillers, which I already was.

‘They just said she had sinusitis, you have to trust the medical professionals, you think they know best.

‘She was in floods of tears and she is not the sort of person to cry, she had an extremely high pain threshold.

‘Essentially, I was just feeding her a time bomb, I was, without knowing, trying to clear a brain haemorrhage with painkillers.

‘It was only when I decided to take her to our doctors’ surgery they said get her to a hospital right away, so I did, I drove her there myself.

‘They were very worried and took her in for tests straight away and that was when I got really worried - I thought she was going to die.

‘Since all this has happened, I have heard nothing from the ambulance service, I want this to be stopped.

‘I don’t want this happening to another family because it may be worse than what we had to go through.’

Mrs Trewick was finally discharged from hospital to go home with her family on January 6.

Mr Trewick has now made a formal complaint to the ambulance service about the treatment his wife received

She still needs help walking and struggles to talk but the family are hopeful she can make a full recovery.

Mr Trewick added: ‘She is getting better day by day now, I assist her to walk, her brain still doesn’t give messages to her body correctly sometimes and simple words can be a struggle but we are just happy she is alive.’

A spokesperson for the East Midlands Ambulance Service said: ‘Mr Trewick has submitted a formal complaint about our response to his wife’s illness and we have launched an investigation to establish the facts.

‘As soon as this is complete, we will pass on details of our findings to him direct.’
