A not so secret admirer has been spoken to by police after leaving anonymous 'love notes' for a number of women on their car windscreens.

Various females in Doreen, north west of Melbourne, have received the handwritten notes over the past month from a man who signs off with 'Your Secret Admirer'.

The notes compliment the women on their beauty and ask them to make contact via an email address left at the bottom.

Victoria Police's Epping Sexual Offences and Child Abuse Investigation Team launched an investigation into the love notes after officers were alerted to local Facebook pages where the notes were being talked about.

They have since spoken to a 29-year-old Estonian man in relation to the matter.

One of the love note recipients told Fairfax Media she saw the letter 'sticky-taped to my car door while I was having coffee with a girlfriend'.

It's understood at least 10 notes were left on cars mostly during the day at the Woolworths car park in Laurimar near Doreen

'I honestly just laughed about it - I don't think it's a big deal. I definitely didn't go to the police!'

One of the notes read: 'Excuse me, I don't want you to think I'm ridiculous or anything, but you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. Just felt like I had to tell you. Sincerely Yours, Your secret admirer.'

It's understood at least 10 notes were left on cars mostly during the day at the Woolworths car park in Laurimar near Doreen.

Police said the man regularly sat outside the shop in his car, but no one bothered to notify police of his constant presence. 

'He has set up Facebook profiles that were linked to a phone number that he left on one note, and he had an email address that was linked to another one, and both of those were in someones else's name - he's done a fair bit to hide his tracks,' Detective Senior Constable Graeme Wassell told the Age.

The Epping Sexual Offences and Child Abuse Investigation Team launched an investigation after officers were alerted to local Facebook pages where the notes were being talked about.
