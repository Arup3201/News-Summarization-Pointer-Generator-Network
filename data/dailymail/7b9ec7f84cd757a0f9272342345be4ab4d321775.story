Brendan Rodgers has outlined his vision to take Liverpool forward and is targeting up to five quality additions to bolster his squad.

Though Rodgers has vowed to fight until the final whistle on Sunday, he has conceded Liverpool’s hopes of winning their first title since 1990 have almost been extinguished after only taking one point from their last two games against Chelsea and Crystal Palace.

But wherever Liverpool finish this campaign, Rodgers is aware that improvements need to be made to the squad during the summer and believes the fact they can guarantee Champions League football will give them a considerable lure.

Top target: Adam Lallana (right) is wanted by Liverpool this summer

Liverpool did not sign anyone in January but their scouts have identified a number of targets, including Southampton’s Adam Lallana and Cardiff defender Steven Caulker, as having the potential to improve the squad and take the club forward.

‘The work has been on-going for a little while now, especially since we consolidated a place in the Champions League,’ said Rodgers. ‘I think we are a real attractive proposition to players through Europe. We are right on the football map now but we have got work to do. 

‘We will see how quickly we can get things done. I meet regularly with the recruitment boys. For them and their status when they are going to games in Europe, meeting agents and watching players, it has been great (being in the Champions League already). 

‘But we have to work hard to make the right decision for the right type of player to come in here. But there is no doubt it helps you a great deal. Last year we spoke to a number of targets but (missed out as) they wanted Champions League football.’

There is little doubt Liverpool’s lack of depth – players to change games – has proved costly this season, compared to a City side he has described as “having the highest wage bill in the history of sport”.

Defensive rock: Steven Caulker is another name on Liverpool's shortlist

‘The players we brought in last summer were young and for cover,’ he said. ‘Now we need to bring in starters. One of the things watching the Manchester City game the other night, they bring on (Stevan) Jovetic, who scores – £23million; Fernandinho £29million and (Alvaro) Negredo £20million.

‘That level of player to bring into the game is massive for you and this year the reality is we’ve been unable to do that.’ 

Rodgers has admitted the draw at Crystal Palace on Monday night, when Liverpool shipped three goals in nine minutes after leading 3-0, was the 'lowest he has felt in football' but he believes the chastening experience at Selhurst Park will actually help his side progress.

‘Sometimes I will say something after the game but I said nothing,’ he said. ‘I had my own thoughts and watched the game again on the way back before I went home; we’ve spoken this week and look to move on. There is a great deal of learning will come out of that game. It’s a great reference point.

‘But this is only the beginning for us. I hear about how other teams will improve next season but I think we will improve dramatically. Even people like Steven Gerrard will improve dramatically next season. We are really excited about the future.’
