A father who was so obsessed with gaining custody of his daughter that he beat his ex-girlfriend to death with a rolling pin was today given a life sentence after being convicted of murder.

Adam Singer killed Sally Ann Harrison in an 'appalling and murderous attack' because she was planning to move out along with their 21-month-old daughter Isabella.

He then fled the scene and left her to be found slumped on the sofa having suffered fatal head injuries.

Singer, 30, denied murder - but a court heard that he had stolen the rolling pin days earlier from the HMS Drake naval base in Plymouth, Devon where he worked as a galley assistant.

He had also 'rehearsed' the attack with a colleague, and asked whether a rolling pin could kill.

The defendant was yesterday convicted of murder by a unanimous jury, and today judge Graham Cottle sentenced him to life in prison with a minimum of 18 years before he is eligible for parole.

'I have no doubt you were going to use any means at your disposal to try and secure custody,' the judge said at Bristol Crown Court. 'You produced the rolling pin from your rucksack and you bludgeoned Sally to death with it.

'She was sat on the sofa in her dressing gown and pyjamas when the attack started and she never moved other than to fall side ways under the blows you rained on her head.

'It was an appalling and murderous 
attack. You are cunning, deceitful and manipulative and are somebody who
 will continue to present a very real danger to any woman you meet and 
form a relationship with in the future.

'You
 have deprived Isabella of her mother and you have deprived Sally of the
 joys of bringing up her child. You have deprived those near and dear to
 Sally of a young woman who everybody spoke of in a warm and 
affectionate capacity.'

Simon
 Laws QC, prosecuting, told the court that Singer and Ms Harrison, 24, 
had met in November 2006 and moved in together in Plymouth shortly 
before the birth of Isabella in July 2010.

They split in early 2012, but continued living together even after they had both found new partners.

When Ms Harrison announced she was planning to leave, Singer became increasingly obsessed with securing custody of Isabella.

A
 series of Facebook messages were read to the court in which Ms Harrison
 claimed her ex-partner wanted sole custody and intended to make her a 
'weekend mum'.

Planned: Singer took a rolling pin from his workplace days before murdering his ex-girlfriend

Singer discovered that Ms Harrison was in a relationship with another man by reading her email, and the prosecution claimed he planned to use the information as evidence during a custody hearing.

'You were digging for dirt to use against Sally,' Mr Laws said. 'You thought that might help you in the custody battle with Sally after Isabella.

'You said the way she dressed and the fact she was a "slag" would count against her. You told her, "You dress in a provocative way and have sex with other men, that means I will get Isabella," didn't you?'

Singer had been brandishing a rolling pin in front of colleagues in the days before the killing, and talked about murder and suicide in what Mr Laws described as a 'rehearsal'.

On April 4, 2012, he bludgeoned Ms Harrison over the head and killed her, before leaving home and returning hours later to 'play the part of the bereaved boyfriend' in front of police.

He later admitted taking the rolling pin from work, but said he had only taken it to bake with his girlfriend and daughter.

The victim's grandparents, Ann and Peter McCurrie, said after the sentencing that justice had finally been served.

'There are no winners in this case, but justice has finally been done, two years later, for Sally,' Mr McCurrie said. 'But nothing will never bring her back. We miss her every day.

'Sally will never be able to see her daughter again, she will never walk through the door again. Isabella is now effectively an orphan, she will be 22 before her father is released.

'We miss Sally incredibly. She was an absolutely lovely girl, she was very close to us, she would visit all the time. She was bubbly and happy and always smiling and always putting others first.'
