The male members of Rutgers University drum line couldn't believe their ears when they learned they were going to appear with a bevy of supermodels in recording the Victoria's Secret fashion show.

Things got even better on Wednesday night when they got to spend time and take photos with the celebrated models, as well as musicians Taylor Swift and Fall Out Boy.

And the amusing snaps taken by some of the students during the filming of the annual runway event, to be screened in December, show their cheeky disbelief.Â

Smiles: Several members of the Rutgers University Marching Scarlet Knights posed with models during Wednesday's event

Timothy Smith, director of the Rutgers University Marching Scarlet Knights, told NJ.com of the moment he told the drummers about the performance request back in August.

'I asked a group of 18- to 21-year-old mostly male students if they'd be interested in performing at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show,' Smith said. 'They didn't wait a nanosecond to say, 'Of course!''

On Wednesday the students discovered that the models have to pass the door of their dressing room to get to the runway and didn't waste any time in saying hello.

The group of 15 students consisted of 14 males and one female.

Drummer Paul Nalesnik was one of several who got his photo taken with a lingerie model and his face says it all. Nalesnik quickly made this his Facebook profile picture.

Union Jack: The band performed as a 'British Invasion' themed section of the show

Pricey: Candice Swanepoel got the glory of the opening look, wearing a $10 million bra decorated with diamonds, rubies and sapphires that was cleverly dubbed the 'Crown Jewels'

Several grinning members of the Marching Scarlet Knights posed with models during Wednesday's event.

'The girls stopped and wanted to have their pictures taken with our guys,' Smith continued. 'They were so nice and enthusiastic. The same for Taylor Swift.

'She (said), 'Hey, how are you doing? Good luck.' I had hoped it was going to be a good experience, but my goodness, this totally exceeded my expectations,' the director told the website.

Rutgers Marching Scarlet Knights reportedly got the rare invite to appear on the show through one of Smith's contacts.

The drum line kicked off the show in military dress appearing as part of one of the British Invasion theme. They had spent several months practicing and preparing for the show.

VIP: The band got plenty of attention, including from a make-up artist

The Victoria's Secret Angels worked their magic on the catwalk, weaving between chart-toppers Taylor Swift and Fall Out Boy, and some fancy sets and stage tricks, yet somehow keeping the spotlight mostly on themselves.

Swift donned a Union Jack costume and a sparkly silver mini-dress, but she never put on the lingerie that makes this annual fashion show so famous.

She did give a lively performance of I Knew You Were Trouble that got the crowd at the Lexington Avenue Armory on its feet.

Favorite models Karlie Kloss, Joan Smalls, Alessandra Ambrosio and Doutzen Kroes paraded in outfits that fitted the other themes of Snow Angels, Shipwrecked, Parisian Nights, Pink Network and Birds of Paradise.

At her fitting for her Psychedelic Angel costume, with hand-painted thigh-high boots and maybe the biggest wings of the show, Kloss said that while the garments are skimpy, they take months to make.

Candice Swanepoel got the glory of the opening look, wearing a $10 million bra decorated with diamonds, rubies and sapphires that was cleverly dubbed the 'Crown Jewels.'

She was quickly followed by Cara Delevingne as an English soccer player and Lily Aldridge, who often gets the good-girl outfits, as a punk in a tartan plaid skirt that no school would allow.

This was the 18th Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. It will be shown as a one-hour special on CBS on December 10.
