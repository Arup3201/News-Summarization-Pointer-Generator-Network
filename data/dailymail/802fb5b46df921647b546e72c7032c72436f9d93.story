Councils are being investigated for an ‘illegal’ parking strategy in which wardens are given bonuses to hand out more fines.

Documents have shown that at least three local authorities are setting targets or incentivising parking officers to ticket motorists despite this being banned under official rules.

Local Government Minister Brandon Lewis has launched a probe into the contracts and said they will be stopped if proven illegal.

Councils are being investigated for an 'illegal' parking strategy in which wardens are given bonuses to hand out more fines

The BBC Inside Out investigation looked into three councils in London - amid fears the same practices could be being used across the country.

It found Bromley Council’s contract with parking firm Vinci sets a bonus of up to £20 for every ticket issued over an annual baseline of 72,000 penalty charge notices.

Hackney Council allows contractor APCOA to band different wardens according to their hourly ticket issue rate, stating no more than 10 per cent can fall below ‘band two’.

NSL, which runs parking enforcement for Lambeth Council, reveals in its contract that it ‘requires’ the issue of 218,000 penalty notices a year - a figure which was later downsized to 205,000.

After reading the legal documents, Mr Lewis said: ‘These look like entirely the wrong kind of contract motivating and encouraging the staff to go out and penalise people and they only get paid well if they penalise somebody. That’s the wrong way to run the structure.’

He added that lawyers at the Department for Communities and Local Government would now scrutinise the documents to see if they can be challenged in court.

‘[If] it’s proven they are illegal this kind of behaviour has to stop’, he added.

Statutory Guidance to Local Authorities prohibits councils or private companies from setting targets for either the number of tickets they issue or the revenue they raise. It states that performance and rewards or penalties should never be based on the number of parking tickets issued nor should authorities set targets.

Commercial litigation lawyer Keith Oliver says the contracts appear to be ‘a serial breach of government guidance by a whole series of councils ostensibly acting independently but quite clearly cleverly drafted by lawyers to circumvent the government guidance on the subject’.

He described them as ‘disgraceful, unacceptable - arguably unlawful’.

It comes as figures show the councils have racked up significant profits from parking last year. Bromley council made a £5.7m profit from parking charges and fines - up £1m on the previous year.

Hackney had a parking surplus of £7.9m - £2m - while Lambeth made a £12m profit, more than double the previous year’s profit.

All three councils point out the number of tickets issued is falling.

As for the contracts themselves, Lambeth Council says: ‘This is not a target - it’s a figure for guidance so NSL can plan the number of staff they will need.’ Its contractor NSL said: ‘NSL incurs no penalties for not issuing tickets and nor are there awards for issuing tickets.’

Bromley Council said they ‘never set targets for revenue from parking enforcement income’. It also pointed out its contract ‘commenced in 2006, predating the Statutory Guidance by two years’ but said ‘the council lawyers remain content with the integrity of the contract’.

Hackney Council insisted that it ‘sets no targets for the issue of penalty charge notices nor gives the contractor any incentive for its officers to issue more than they feel necessary’. However, it conceded it has removed that section of the contract.

The Mail revealed NSL, formerly NCP, Britain’s biggest parking enforcer, had issued thousands of wrongful tickets to unsuspecting motorists so wardens could hit targets in 2010.

A whistleblower provided evidence that showed at one London local authority, managers wrote ‘only cancel if appealed’ on paperwork for dozens of tickets issued for no legitimate reason rather than simply cancel them.
