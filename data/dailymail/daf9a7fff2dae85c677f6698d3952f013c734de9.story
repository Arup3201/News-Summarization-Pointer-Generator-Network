Apple has applied for a trademark for ‘iWatch’ in Japan, a patent official has said.

This news suggests that the iPhone maker may be moving ahead with plans for a watch-like device.

The news comes at a time when gadget makers are turning their attention to wearable computers.

The trademark application, submitted on 
June 3 and released on the Japan Patent Office website on June 27, would
 cover computers, computer peripherals and wristwatches, the official 
said.

These current claims confirm plans laid out in an 2011 Apple patent. The patent described a 'wearable device' with a 'flexible display' that could use the same technology as a child's slap wrap, patent image pictured. Its battery life could be extended, using a 'solar panel array', or 'a kinetic power source

Apple's latest patent application suggests the company is pushing forward with its plans to launch what's been dubbed the iWatch. A patent image, pictured, shows what the strap could look like

He added that it was unknown how long the application process would require.

An Apple spokesman in Japan could not immediately be reached for comment.

Speculation has mounted that Apple is preparing to launch an iWatch and CEO Tim Cook told a gathering of technology and media executives a month ago that wearable products were ripe for exploration.

However, he added he was sceptical about Google Inc's recently unveiled Glass which combines a mobile computer and eyeglasses.

‘There's nothing that's going to convince a kid who has never worn glasses or a band or a watch to wear one, or at least I haven't seen it,’ Mr Cook said.

Rumours about a possible so-called iWatch first emerged in December when Chinese manufacturers let the news slip.

In February, it was reported that Apple had applied for a patent for a wearable device in the U.S and the same month MacUser magazine created an artist's impression of what the wearable tech could potentially look like.

Yrving Torrealba's translucent concept of how the iWatch might look has proved to be misguided, if Apple does indeed base their gadget on the technology in their latest patent application

Analysts believe that the Apple smartwatch could be made of glass, will have a one-and-a-half inch LED screen and let users to send and receive email, texts and Facebook alerts as well as communicating with other devices wirelessly though Bluetooth.

The U.S. patent application no. 20130044215, filed by Apple originally in August 2011, specifies the technology for a 'wearable accessory device' with a 'flexible display'.

It describes: 'A wearable video device 
... comprising: a flexible substrate having a flat state and a curled 
state [and] a flexible display disposed upon a first surface of the 
flexible substrate.'

It is expected to run on iOS and a team of 100 engineers, led by head of design Jony Ive, is reportedly working on the project.

Previous iWatch concept images, including this one from MacUser magazine, featured a square screen, and a clunky design, that more closely resembled Samsung's Galaxy Gear smartwatch

Wearable devices are considered a potential area for hit products as smartphones, such as the iPhone and Samsung Electronics Co's Galaxy series, are losing their ability to impress consumers and investors.

Samsung, which has leapfrogged Apple as the world's leading smartphone maker, is also developing a wearable device similar to a wristwatch, a source has said.

The New York Times reported in February that Apple was experimenting with the design of a device similar to a wristwatch that would operate on the same iOS platform as its iPhone and iPad and would be made with curved glass.
