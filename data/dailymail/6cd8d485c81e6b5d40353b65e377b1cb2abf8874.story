He has been arrested on suspicion of 
murder. Mr McKoy was taken to hospital where he remains in a stable 
condition with injuries thought to be non-life threatening.

Shocked
 friends and neighbours described community centre manager Val, who has 
two other children - Sakinah, 14, and Marshall, 15 - as ‘involved in the
 community’.

One devastated 
friend said: ‘Val was really well-known in the community, she helped 
everyone. Jazra was a happy, energetic little girl. She was bubbly and 
healthy, she had just started talking.’

A
 force spokesman said: ‘Post-mortems will take place in due course. 
Detectives from the Homicide and Major Crime Command are dealing.

‘The
 investigation is being led by Detective Chief Inspector Charles King. 
Enquiries continue to establish the circumstances of the incident.’
