A truck driver who allegedly fell asleep at the wheel has been charged in the horrific crash which left comedian Tracy Morgan in a critical condition and his closest confidante James McNair dead.

30 Rock star Morgan and his entourage were being chauffeured from a show in Delaware back to New York City about 1am Saturday, when the truck driver rear-ended their 
limousine bus and caused a fatal six-car pile up on the New Jersey 
Turnpike.

Morgan's 'traumatized' ex-wife has revealed 'he's not in good shape' after being pulled from the wreckage with a broken leg among other injuries. He is reportedly in a critical but stable condition.

Morgan's assistant Jeffrey Millea, 36, and comedian Ardie Fuqua are also in a critical condition, while 62-year-old McNair, who performed as 
Jimmy Mack and was one of Morgan's closest friends, died at the scene.

Comic Harris Stanton was treated and released from hospital. Two others in the limo were unhurt, including the driver.

Truck driver Kevin Roper, 35, has been charged with death by auto and also faces four counts of assault by auto. Bail was set at $50,000 and he is expected to surrender.

New Jersey State Police Sgt. Gregory Williams said Roper, from Jonesboro in Georgia, apparently failed to notice
 slow traffic ahead of his 18-wheeler and swerved at the last minute to 
avoid a crash near Cranbury Township.

But the vehicle plowed into the back of the limo, a 2012 Mercedes Benz Sprinter, prompting a chain-reaction crash with a second tractor-trailer, an SUV and two cars. The limo rotated clockwise and flipped over.

'Driver failed to observe slow-moving traffic ahead,' Sgt Williams said according to ABC News.

'He observed at the last minute - just prior to impact - the limo bus carrying Morgan and his party.'

He said alcohol was not believed to be a factor in the crash.

ABC News reported the driver was 'dozing', but police would not confirm the report.

The National Transportation Safety Board said it was working with state police to look at any issues in the crash related to commercial trucking and limousine safety.

Family: Tracy Morgan and his ex-wife Sabina Morgan

Morgan and Millea, from Shelton in Connecticut, were flown to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick with critical injuries.

Morgan's ex-wife Sabina Morgan told New York Daily News the crash has shocked and distressed family members.

'He’s
 not in good shape. I’m traumatized. I’m so upset. I can’t believe it. 
It’s like I’m in a nightmare,' the mother of three of Morgan's children 
said.

'We’re just still vigilant with prayer...They’re (our children) not holding up well at all.'

She said Morgan, 45, had
 a broken leg and was lying unconscious in hospital, but doctors anticipated he would 
recover.

Sabina Morgan said her old high school sweetheart, who she divorced in 2009, would be heartbroken to know one of his closest friends, McNair, had died.

'He was one of the first comedians that took Tracy under his wing,' she said of McNair. 'They were very close.'

McNair’s sister, Valerie Daniel, told CNN that her brother 'spoke very highly of Tracy. They go way back.'

Morgan's publicist, Lewis Kay, said in a statement: 'His family is now with him (in hospital) and he is receiving excellent care. We don’t anticipate much of a change in his condition today.'

Meanwhile the mother of Morgan’s fiancée, Megan Wollover, said she was heartbroken.

'I was devastated,' Christine Wollover told New York Daily News. 'I couldn’t believe it. I was just hoping and praying that my daughter and the baby weren’t in the car.'

Wollover
 said her 27-year-old daughter and the couple’s 11-month-old 
baby usually travel with the comedian on tours.

'I’m relieved for her and my granddaughter,' 
she said. 'But (Morgan) is the foundation. I love him dearly, and I just
 hope he gets through this.'

The New Jersey Turnpike was closed for more than five hours after the crash.

Just hours before the fatal crash, Fuqua had posted a picture on Instagram of Morgan performing at Dover Downs Hotel & Casino in Dover, Delaware.

Morgan had been booked for the casino's entertainment, with a show called 
Tracy Morgan - Turn It Funny!, with tickets costing between $35 to $65.

'This is 
what it looks like from the stage to see a standing ovation from 1500 
people. Then we traveled back to NYC in style in a luxury Mercedes 
Sprinter. Road life is a good life! #tracymorgan,' Fuqua wrote in the
 post's caption.

Morgan had been due to perform the same show in North Carolina tonight, but that leg of the tour has been canceled.

Walmart President Bill Simon issued a statement saying one of the firm's trucks was involved in the accident.

While noting that the crash remains under investigation, Simon said 'Walmart will take full responsibility' if authorities determine that the company's truck caused the accident.

'We're praying for the family and friends of the passenger who lost his life in the terrible accident,' the statement said.

'Our hearts go out to everyone involved and we hope those who were injured get the care that they need and make a full recovery.'

Morgan's limo was owned by Atlantic Transportation Services, which said it had one employee behind the wheel and a second in the front passenger seat.

'Although the investigation is still pending, we concur with the preliminary reports that the accident was caused by another vehicle traveling behind the Atlantic limo bus,' the Rehoboth Beach, Delaware-based company said.

'We are grateful that our drivers did not sustain life-threatening injuries.'

Star: Morgan made his name on Saturday Night Live! before joining the cast of hit show 30 Rock

Morgan, a New York City native, joined Saturday Night Live in 1996 and was on the sketch-comedy program for seven years before leaving to star in The Tracy Morgan Show in 2003. That show lasted just one season.

In 2006, Morgan found a long-running role on NBC's hit show 30 Rock, which was created by SNL co-star Tina Fey. He received an Emmy nomination for best supporting actor for 30 Rock in 2009.

Morgan grew up fatherless, one of five siblings, in a blighted section of Brooklyn, where he helped raise and support the family.

He once called his gift for being funny 'a defense mechanism' for his miserable circumstances. As a teen, he started doing comedy on the streets to supplement the family's welfare income. His tough upbringing informed his humor.

In recent years, he has struggled with alcoholism and drunken driving arrests. He had a successful kidney transplant in late 2010.

Morgan has three grown sons with his ex-wife, and a daughter, Maven Sonae, born last July to his fiancee, Megan Wollover.

His films include Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, 'The Longest Yard, 'First Sunday, 'Rio and Why Stop Now.
