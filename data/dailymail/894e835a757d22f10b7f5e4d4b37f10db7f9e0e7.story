BBC commentator Mark Lawrenson has come under fire for a 'sexist' comment made during the Argentina versus Switzerland World Cup game.

Switzerland striker Josip Drmic's weak shot at goal during their round of 16 clash with Argentina on Tuesday evening prompted Lawrenson to state Drmic 'should have put a skirt on'.

Lawrenson's comment caused a storm on social media and has triggered 172 angry complaints to the BBC with claims it was offensive and sexist.

BBC commentator Mark Lawrenson made the 'sexist' comment after Switzerland's Josip Drmic's weak shot, right, during his team's knockout match against Argentina two nights ago

Unhappy listeners were quick to voice their disdain with his quip, made during live commentary, and took to Twitter to voice their anger.

Mark Batham tweeted: 'Wow. Just watching back ARG v SWI. Unbelievable casual sexism by Mark Lawrenson. Unacceptable @BBCSport.'

Holly Evans said: 'Wow. Some rather extreme sexism from Mark Lawrenson. Rather offensive, actually.'

Others directed their anger towards the BBC, with one listener writing it was a 'sad bit of sexism from Mark Lawrenson there really is this the best the BBC can do?'

Reaction to the comment was furious, with many bemoaning the BBC's choice of pundits

There was a flurry of tweets criticising the commentator after the throwaway comment was made

The BBC confirmed it had received 172 complaints regarding the incident.

A spokesperson also apologised on behalf of Lawrenson, saying: 'The remark was inappropriate and we apologise for any offence caused.'

Broadcasting watchdog OfCom said it was also aware of the incident.

IIt had received six complaints but had not yet decided whether it be formally investigating.

However, 
Lawrenson's BBC colleague Gary Lineker has also copped flak for cracking
 an offensive Twitter joke during the Belgium versus USA match.

The
 Match of the Day pundit and former England striker tweeted his thoughts
 on the match, saying: 'It's open, yet tight. Some would say that's the 
perfect combination.'

The joke did not go down well with everybody, with many branding it offensive and disgusting.

The BBC's World Cup commentary team has come under heavy critcism this summer for a series of gaffes and the belief some of its members are not up to standard.

Former Everton player Phil Neville bore the brunt of the criticism, with complaints about his lack of emotion and 'monotone' style during England's opening game with Italy.

The BBC received more than 400 complaints about his performance.

Another incident for which the BBC drew widespread flak was Jonathan Pierce's failure to understand the newly implemented goal-line technology during the France and Honduras game.

Failing to understand the way goal-line technology was being used during the tournament, Pearce's commentary descended into chaos when he appeared confused by a computer animation that first showed 'no goal' when the football hit the post, before changing to 'goal' when it crossed the line.

The BBC's World Cup commentary team has come under heavy critcism this summer for a series of gaffes and the belief some of its members are not up to the standard necessary to cover the World Cup in Brazil.

The BBC received more than 400 complaints
 about former Everton player Phil Neville's performance.

However, the BBC has defended its World Cup coverage.

The
 corporation acknowledged that some fans were unhappy but it brushed off
 the complaints, insisting its team was 'very strong' and it will 'take 
time' for viewers to get used to them.

In a statement released late last month it said:

'We believe we have put together a very strong international line-up, with a wealth of experience and knowledge covering all aspects of the game at the very highest level.

'Thoughts on individual presenters and commentators can vary considerably so it's inevitable some viewers or listeners will dislike or disapprove of certain presenters and commentators.'
