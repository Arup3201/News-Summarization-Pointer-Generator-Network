Toronto's crack-smoking mayor Rob Ford has released a picture on himself taking a dip in the pool at his rehab clinic.

He also announced plans to be out the clinic on June 31 so he can launch his reelection campaign on July 1 - Canada Day.

Ford has been at the Greenestone facility, in Ontario, since checking himself in on May 1 after another drunken rant was caught on camera.

Rob Ford, the mayor of Toronto who was filmed last year smoking crack cocaine, has been picture enjoying a swim at his GreeneStone rehab clinic in Ontario

Ford said today that he plans to be back at home on July 1 when he will launch his reelection campaign (pictured at Toronto town hall in November 2013)

Speaking to the Toronto Sun, he said: 'I will be back, I guarantee you. I am coming back and you will see a different Rob Ford.'

Speaking about his time in the clinic, Ford said he has been able to work out, relax and make some friends, though confesses he has been missing his family.

The only time he has seen his wife and children was for a trip to Crabby Joe's on his birthday, and he adds that he is anxious to get back to them.

On the subject of his addiction, he acknowledges that it is his own fault.

He said: 'No one has enabled me. We were talking about the enabling thing the other day in a meeting. You do booze or drugs because you want to do it.

'I take full responsibility. I have learned my lesson.'

Ford was pictured looking glum outside the clinic last month, wearing an orange sweater, jeans and Crocs

'I feel good. You are going to see a difference. You are going to see a healthier Rob Ford and I am going to win the election on Oct. 27.'

The picture is the first time Ford has been seen inside the clinic, though last month he was pictured outside wearing
 a bright orange Texas Longhorns sweater, jeans and Crocs.

On that occasion, 44-year-old looked glum during the brisk stroll, despite earlier 
calling the luxurious rehabilitation center 'amazing' and saying it 
reminded him of 'football camp'.

A week before that, he was seen in Bracebridge, which is about 25 miles east of the center. He was seen chatting with local residents, many of whom snapped pictures with him and posted them online.

In a bizarre twist, he also made headlines last month when a former fellow resident at the clinic, 36-year-old LeeAnne Rob, was charged with drink-driving his SUV.

She also suggested that she had left her watch in his room, although the has since refused to comment on the nature of their relationship.

Glum: Ford kept his head down as he took the paths at the center last month, which is just north of Toronto

Reflection: He kept his head down as he walked along the path at GreeneStone Clinic in Ontario

He's
 is allowed to leave the clinic to run personal errands such as banking,
 but otherwise he's in treatment '24/7,' his lawyer Dennis Morris told the National Post.

Ford previously declared that 'rehab is amazing' and that it reminded him 
of 'football camp'.

Speaking to the Toronto Sun at the start of the month, Ford said he feels 'great' and is benefiting from the 
self-imposed exile.

'It
 reminds me of football camp. Kind of like the Washington Redskins camp I
 went to as a kid,' he said, adding 'I am working out every day and I am
 learning about myself, my past and things like that.'

Luxury: Ford previously claimed that his rehab was costing $100,000 - and said it was worth every cent

Residence: The clinic has 'treetop cottages and executive townhouses' with 'rustic suites', its website says

He
 joked 'on October 28 there will be no need to change the locks. There 
will be no need to clean out my office because I am coming back.'

He said the very public fall from grace - including a video of him smoking crack, being filmed while drunk and making lewd comments about his wife - was what he needed to shake him into action.

'I do feel bad about what happened, but it might have been the best thing that happened because I am working on getting better,' he told the Sun reporter.

He
 said the decision to check himself into rehab came on April 29 - the 
morning after he was taped in an apparent intoxicated state at a city 
pub.

During the rant, he also claimed he was 'in a divorce' and staying at a hotel. He has been married to wife Renata since 2000.

Out and about: Ford, 44, has been spotted in the nearby town of Bracebridge, where he has posed for photographs with fans. He has not said how long he will remain there

Out of control: Ford (pictured in January with Toronto's chief budget officer) found himself in deep water last year when a video emerged of him using crack cocaine. Others emerged of his drunken tirades

The
 same day Ford announced his leave of absence, the Globe and Mail 
published screen grabs of a new video which shows Ford smoking the 
illegal drug at his sister's house on April 26 before apparently checking into GreenStone.

On the centres website, it says: 'Located in a resort setting in scenic Muskoka, Ontario and equipped with holistic spa services, delicious, nutritious and seasonal menus offered through our Lodge Restaurant, and a full suite of fitness and recreation facilities.'

Its accommodation consist of 'treetop cottages and executive townhouses' that 'feature rustic suites.'

Ford previously indicated to the Toronto Sun that his treatment could cost as much as $100,000.

'It’s worth every dime, every dime,' he said. 'A hundred grand is cheap. It’s a steal.'
