Wales flanker Dan Lydiate has revealed Warren Gatland’s men will seek to exploit any ‘chinks in the armour’ of England in their Six Nations opener next week.

England hooker Dylan Hartley, whose ill-discipline has led to career suspensions totalling 50 weeks, has been warned by forwards coach Graham Rowntree that he can expect intense goading in Cardiff.

Lydiate  conceded that ‘chatting’ with opponents is part and parcel of the game.

‘Some players are more vocal than others,’ said Lydiate. ‘In your own team you have leaders who do the main chatting in a game. You look for chinks in the armour.’

Gatland believes the decision to sacrifice rugby training for fitness drills helped Wales overcome their southern hemisphere demons during the autumn internationals.

A 12-6 victory over South Africa ended a run of 22 consecutive defeats to the ‘big three’ and Gatland believes adopting a pre-season style fitness programme before the four-Test series paid dividends.

Early preparations were based around 6.30am bike training followed by sessions in the cryotheraphy chamber, as the coaches focused on narrowing the speed deficit between the northern and southern hemisphere.

‘We flipped it over for the last two weeks,’ Gatland told ESPN. ‘For New Zealand and South Africa, we did a lot of rugby. Against the All Blacks we were winning after 69 minutes and in the past they beat us by playing rugby. But we coped with that and I remember thinking “we’ve never been in this situation before”.’

GPS data shows the rugby played by the Welsh regions is much slower than the Super Rugby competition in the southern hemisphere. A Welsh regional player covers 55 metres per minute on average while in Super Rugby it’s 90 metres per minute.

Consequently, Wales spent minimal time working on skills during the first half of their November camp.

However, Gatland is unlikely to take the same approach preparing for the England game.

‘The Six Nations is different,’ said the Wales coach.
