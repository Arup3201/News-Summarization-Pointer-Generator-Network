The family of a 3-year-old autistic Florida boy have won their fight to keep the therapy chickens that helped their son finally learn to communicate.

City officials in DeBary, Florida nearly took away J.J. Hart’s feathered friends after a December 4 decision to ban backyard coops.

‘We're very happy,’ J.J.'s mother Ashleigh said Wednesday. ‘We like to think that the chickens have been a great help in addition to everything else that we've done for J.J.’

'Best friends': Here, J.J. stands with his beloved hens. Though unconventional, the autism companions helped bring the boy out of his shell

The City Council relented after a Today show appearance and threats from the family attorney to take the small town case all the way to federal court.

Members of the council plan to vote December 18 to accommodate the Hart family’s chickens, reports the Orlando Sentinel.

‘This
is a 100 percent win for J.J.,’ said family attorney Mark Nation. 
‘People with disabilities do have special needs and accommodations.’

While
the scales appear tipped in Hart’s favor now, the family once feared 
their uncooperative neighbors might take away J.J.’s best friends.

Close call: The Debary city council (pictured) voted to end a one-year trial program that allowed chicken coops, which would have left J.J. bereft of the birds the helped him 'find his voice'

'100 percent win': The family's attorney Mark Nation claims the city council decided to vote on the exception for J.J. after he threatened to take his case to federal court under the Federal Fair Housing Act, Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act

J.J. Hart's family learned of the 
council's decision to last week end a one-year trial program granting 
residents the right to own backyard coops.

‘They
expect us to get rid of them, but that's not an option,’ Ashleigh Hart 
told the Daily News last week. ‘With a child that has autism, you find 
something that works and you keep it.’

The
Hart family hired Nation to help reverse the council's decision and 
allow them to keep the chickens they've named Snow, Cinnamon and Ginger.

Happy day! 3-year-old autistic Florida boy J.J. Hart will likely get to keep his beloved therapy chickens after all. The city council in Debary will vote on a special exception to the town's no coop rule just for J.J.

Nation
says it was his threat to take the case to federal court under the 
Federal Fair Housing Act, Americans with Disabilities Act and the 
Rehabilitation Act that forced the vote for a special exception to the 
chicken ban.

DeBary Mayor Bob Garcia told the Orlando Sentinel he supports the Harts.

‘I always felt that it was a violation of a person's rights,’ Garcia said.

In December of 2012, DeBary enacted a one-year test run allowing families in residential areas to keep three chickens.

The
program was created after the Hart family, who purchased chickens after
researching the positive affect of animals on autism, asked for 
permission to keep their chickens.

Keeping a coop is no easy task. Residents wishing to maintain chickens must obtain a city permit.

It also costs between $500 and $800 per year to keep a coop with proper fencing.

The
DeBary council's decision to discontinue residential coops will affect 
the only two loving homes in the community who decided to care for 
chickens.

One application for a backyard coop was from the Hart's and another was from a woman who wanted to use the chickens for eggs.
