It used to be Cowboys and Indians or Cops and Robbers, now school children are playing a new sickening game in the playground: Jihadi John and the hostages.

The online plague of Islamic State propaganda has inspired a worrying new trend among some school children to shockingly re-enact the group’s disturbing execution videos.

The latest video from Libya, showing the beheading of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians on a beach, has inspired a group of children in Yemen to film their own mock up version and post it online.

Sickening: The video in Yemen shows five young boys, aged around 10-years-old and wearing only trousers, being led to a beach by five teenagers

Chilling: The video bares a striking resemblance to ISIS' real murder video of 21 Coptic Christians on a beach in Libya and suggests the young boys have been studying the footage intently

The real thing: Each boy appears deep in character, honed from studying the authentic Coptic murder video

Blood in the Mediterranean: The real ISIS video they boys reenact was released by the terror group last month

The grainy mobile phone footage was reportedly filmed somewhere on the Gulf coast in Yemen.

It shows five young boys, possibly aged around 10-years-old, wearing only trousers, being led to a beach by five teenage boys.

The teenage boys are fully dressed and their faces are covered by scarfs to imitate the masked murderers from the Islamic State execution video.

On the way to the beach, the older boys each pick up a stick, mimicking the collecting of knives by the executioners in the beheading video of 21 Syrian soldiers released in November 2014.

Accompanied to the soundtrack of a prominent Islamic State nasheed, the cameraman attempts to replicate some of the filming techniques used by Islamic State’s film producers, al-Hayat Media Center.

Slow motion action shots and close up shots of the victims are shown in the video.

Standing in the middle, one of the older boys in a white long sleeve tee-shirt and red tracksuit bottoms, begins to reel off extracts of Jihadi John’s speech.

Furiously gesticulating with his pretend knife, the older boy, face obscured by a thick scarf, rants in the style of Jihadi John before the pretend executions begin.

The chilling soundtrack of throat slitting and the final gasps of breath are played over the film whilst the boys attempt to replicate the atrocities on the Libyan beach.

The cameraman takes time to film close-up shots of the young boys, pretending to lie dead on the sand. Their motionless bodies lie face down with their hands still held behind their back.

Three older men can be seen watching in the background when the cameraman films the scene from the side.

The video even finishes with similar shots of the blood stained water at the end of the Libyan execution video.

It is not just in Yemen that Islamic State videos have been re-enacted by young boys. A similar video, made by a group of Egyptian teenage boys, was also posted online.

 Despite the victims being Egyptian nationals, the teenagers see little wrong in mocking the persecution of their fellow countrymen.

Similarly the shocking influence of Islamic State’s videos has been seen outside of the Arab world with school girls in Japan producing their own dramatised version.

Last month, Islamic State released a video demanding $200 million for the safe release of Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto.

Two days later, a Vine video emerged on social media showing three Japanese school girls re-enacting the horrifying video.

The six second video opens with a close up of one of the girls having a black and white scarf wrapped around their face to obscure her identity.

Brutal: Despite the victims being Egyptian nationals, the teenagers see little wrong in mocking the persecution of their fellow countrymen

Two girls, innocently dressed in their navy school uniform with a white cravat, are shown kneeling on the tarmac. Pretending to have their hands tied behind their back, the two school girls stare silently into the camera.

Standing between them is the third friend, posing as Jihadi John. Holding a short samurai like sword in her hand, the school girl begins to mock Jihadi John's threats and gestures.

Such is her enthusiasm to imitate the blood thirsty jihadi, her two friends break into fits of giggles in front of the camera.

The vine video was looped over 50,000 times before it was suspended. The identities of the girls remain unknown.

Another Japanese social media user posted a photo showing three school boys posing as Jihadi John and the two deceased Japanese hostages.

The photo was posted just five days after the Islamic State video was released.

All three boys appear to be in their school uniform and the photo appears to have been taken in a classroom.

Two of the boys are shown kneeling with their hands behind their backs, pretending to be Yukawa and Goto. In the middle, the other boy is shown with his face covered by a grey scarf. His arm is outstretched, copying Jihadi John’s gesture of pointing his knife at the camera.

The identities of all three boys are unknown.
