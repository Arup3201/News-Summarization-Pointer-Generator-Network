Swansea manager Gary Monk has come out in support of Gylfi Sigurdsson and said the midfielder has nothing to prove at the Welsh club.

The 24-year-old has returned to Wales after a two-year spell with Tottenham. The Icelandic midfielder had been on loan at the Swans from Hoffenheim back in 2012.

Although they attempted to sign him on a permanent basis they were beaten to it by Spurs.

But now Sigurdsson is back, and Monk was full of praise for his latest signing. 

Return: Sigurdsson is back in Wales after a two-year spell in at Spurs and Monk says he returns a better player

He said: 'He is a quality player who has come back a better player than when he left,

'He had a difficult time at Tottenham and probably didn't play as regularly as he would have wanted, but obviously there was a lot of competition for the places in the team he was vying for.

'I spoke to him about it. I felt that every time he did play he felt because his chances were limited he had to prove something or score a goal.'

Sigurdsson joins Martin Emnes, Jefferson Montero, Bafetimbi Gomis and Lukasz Fabianski as Swansea's major signings. 

Monk's side will kick off their Premier League campaign against away at Manchester United.
