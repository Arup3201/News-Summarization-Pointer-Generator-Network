Anna Yearley, Labour general secretary is reported to have said that 'Northerners are backwards'

A senior aide to Ed Miliband called Northerners ‘backward’ over choosing women MPs in a blazing row with a Labour veteran, it was claimed last night.

Anna Yearley, the Labour leader’s political secretary and ‘fixer’, is said to have made the remark in an argument over moves to replace Northern male Labour MPs with younger, female ones.

Austin Mitchell, 79, who is retiring as Labour MP for Great Grimsby, North East Lincolnshire, at the next Election, said Ms Yearley told him Labour activists in the North had blocked moves to promote more female MPs – and she was determined to make them toe the line.

The allegation is especially embarrassing for Mr Miliband, whose Doncaster North constituency is in South Yorkshire. Mr Mitchell said Ms Yearley, from Oxfordshire, talked to him like ‘an educationally subnormal pensioner’. 

And, he claimed, leading female Labour MPs ran ‘an orchestrated campaign of abuse’ against him after he attacked the party’s all-women shortlists, designed to produce more female MPs.

The furore took a further turn last night after Labour denied Ms Yearley had made the comment.

But Mr Mitchell hit back, revealing Chief Whip Rosie Winterton, who was present at meetings between them, confirmed it. Miss Winterton later disputed this. Ms Yearley, 35, has emerged as one of the most powerful figures in the Labour leader’s office, acting as a link between Mr Miliband, MPs and unions. It is not the first time she has come under fire – earlier this year she was accused of bullying a junior official.

Mr Mitchell said yesterday: ‘Ms Yearley said Yorkshire and Northerners are very backward when it comes to choosing women and something had to be done about it. She may be right, but Northerners have the right to choose whoever they want. She is a woman on a mission. I find her attitude condescending and it irked me.

‘She talked to me as though I was an educationally subnormal old-age pensioner. She said, “You think the best person for the job is always a man, but I think the best man for the job is a woman.”

Last week's Mail on Sunday reported on the divisive row at the heart of the Labour party 

‘She had no right to treat me like an idiot, it was totally unjustified. She is totally out of touch with the real world.’

Ms Yearley’s style was questioned in June amid claims she treated a junior worker poorly. Gemma Tumelty, 33, quit as Labour’s stakeholder relations manager with a pay-off after complaining about her treatment. Ms Yearley denied any wrongdoing.

She was also blamed for failing to predict the backlash after Mr Miliband posed with a copy of The Sun during the World Cup. The image angered some Liverpudlians who boycott the newspaper over its coverage of the Hillsborough disaster.

A Labour spokesman said: ‘These claims are untrue. We want to see more women in Parliament and we make no apology for introducing, and using, all-women shortlists.’
