A condo developer in Atlanta wants to tear down a historic mansion built for the grandson of Thomas Jefferson, as it’s impeding the development of their property.

But members of a Georgia historic society have come up with a unique option – offering the opulent Randolph-Lucas House to someone who appreciates its historic ties, for free.

The only stipulation is that the buyer most front around $350,000 to move the mansion to a different neighbourhood in the area. And of course, the sundry renovations aren’t free, either.

Eminent domain? A condo association in Atlanta is trying to obtain the land where the Randolph-Lucas mansion now stands

The Federal Revival house was built on Peachtree Road in Atlanta in 1924 for Hollins Nicholas Randolph, who was a prominent attorney in Atlanta and a descendent of the third president of the United States.

Preservationists at the Buckhead Heritage Society have tried to spread the word.

Wright Mitchell, a Buckhead attorney, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the costs of repair are too much of an unknown for prospective buyers.

The condominiums, painted a pale shade of yellow and standing storeys above the mansion, were built in 1997. As part of their contract, they moved the house 35 feet away from the development to comply with zoning regulations.

The association which owns the units claim the historic house is in poor condition, and are filing with the Atlanta Urban Design Commission to tear it down and instead replace it with an open-air pavilion for residents of the condos.

But between the two sides, the 2500 Peachtree Condominium Association has an agreement to hold up – when they built the condos 15 years ago, they were required to move the house.

They were also required to renovate it, according to Reporter Newspapers. 

The house has been empty some 25 years, since its previous owner passed away in the 1980s. From there, it became a popular venue for weddings, and was granted historic status in 1990. 

The condos were allowed to be built if and only if they preserved the house.

Atlanta, like many places in the country, did not have a solid preservation movement in place until well after the 1960s, meaning that many historical buildings from bygone eras have been flattened to make way for newer constructions.

The preservation society told the Journal-Constitution that they’ve had several prospective buyers, but no bites yet.

They said the poor economy isn’t helping. 

They also said the condo association will not let engineers and architects inspect the property to discern how much work the property actually needs.
