Election plan: David Cameron will today launch the six key themes of his party’s pitch to voters in May

Immigration will not feature at the heart of the Conservative election manifesto even though it is voters’ top concern, it emerged last night.

David Cameron will today launch the six key themes of his party’s pitch to the voters in May, saying they will be the deficit, jobs, taxes, education, housing and retirement.

But immigration, Europe and the NHS are conspicuous by their absence. This is despite the fact that last month pollsters revealed immigration is now consistently the most important political issue of concern to voters. YouGov said that since May 2014, people have in every month put it above or tied with the economy.

The issue of immigration remains sensitive for the Tories, who have failed on deliver on their 2010 pledge to cut net immigration to the ‘tens of thousands’ every year thanks largely to an influx of workers from the European Union. Net migration is currently running at 260,000, according to official figures published last month.

Nigel Farage’s Ukip is still polling about 13 per cent and now has two MPs following the defections of Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless to the Tories.

And critics will point out that the absence of the NHS is no coincidence given that it is currently going through an A&E crisis. 

It remains a core Labour issue and one on which Ed Miliband feels he can still score points. 

Last night the Conservatives said that although immigration and the NHS are not due to be manifesto themes, it would be wrong to say they are being ‘ignored’. 

Tackling immigration is a key plank of the party’s long-term economic plan, a source said. Mr Cameron will launch his party’s themes in a speech this morning – concentrating on tackling the deficit.

The inclusion of the deficit as his first key theme contrasts with the way Mr Miliband forgot to mention the issue at all in his conference speech last year. 

The Prime Minister will say that parents must ‘look at the children they love’ and decide whether they should be saddled with the huge debts that he claims a Labour government would entail. 

Latest polling shows that voters name the economy, health and pensions as the key issues facing them and their family, with immigration a key concern for the country

He will insist the Britain of the future must live within its means – and will warn that if it does not, the country would be on the ‘road to ruin’.

He will warn that a Labour victory could leave the UK with a ‘mountain of debt’ to the next generation that they could ‘never hope to re-pay’. ‘This isn’t just about the straightforward economic arguments,’ he will say.

‘It is about the values of this country – whether we as a nation are going to pass on a mountain of debt to the next generations that they could never hope to repay.

‘I say we have a responsibility to act. We can get Britain back to living within our means in a way that is fair and sensible and secure.’

He will say that dealing with the deficit is crucial to make sure the UK can carry on investing in hospitals, schools and strong public services – and cope with future shocks in the global economy. 

‘This means Britain will have to run a surplus so that we start paying down our debts and keep our economy secure, reduce spending and cut out waste instead of increasing taxes on working people, control the welfare budget to save money and reward work, crack down on tax avoidance and ensure those who can afford to pay the most do, and continue to increase spending on the NHS.

‘With the other parties, all you get is confusion; un-costed plans; the spectre of more debt.

Yesterday Chancellor George Osborne (R) claimed Labour was planning a ‘tax bombshell’ equivalent to 3p on income tax or three percentage points on National Insurance

‘With the Conservatives, you get the opposite: a strong and competent team, a proven record, and a long-term economic plan that is turning our country around.’

Yesterday Chancellor George Osborne claimed Labour was planning a ‘tax bombshell’ equivalent to 3p on income tax or three percentage points on National Insurance.

In an interview yesterday, Mr Miliband repeatedly refused to say how much of the savings needed to tackle the deficit would come from cuts to public services and how much would come from tax rises.

Mr Osborne claimed that Labour will be forced to put up taxes because it will not match his pledge to deliver the £30billion fiscal consolidation needed to eliminate the deficit through spending cuts and welfare reductions alone.

The Chancellor told The Sunday Times any party rejecting his plan to balance the books purely through cuts was ‘either offering the country a tax bombshell or a borrowing bombshell or both’. He has asked Mr Miliband to make clear whether he is planning £15billion worth of tax hikes.
