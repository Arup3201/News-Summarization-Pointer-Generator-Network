Roger Federer’s parents Lynette and Robert have watched him play 77 matches at Wimbledon — not always from their vantage point yesterday, inside the Royal Box — but his victory over Colombian Santiago Giraldo was as simple as any.

World No 35 Giraldo has never been to the third round of a Grand Slam.

When his chance came around he found himself staring across the net at the greatest player ever to wield a racquet in an arena where Federer is adored.

Balanced: Roger Federer took just 81 minutes to beat Santiago Giraldo

The seven-time champion sniffed out his opponent’s nerves and broke him after seven minutes at the first opportunity  — 1hr14mins later he broke him again to seal a 6-3, 6-1, 6-3 victory.

Giraldo’s compatriot Alejandro Falla could have supplied a few words of warning if solicited beforehand. Federer has beaten him seven times. Federer has beaten more opponents than anyone playing the game.

As he ages and his bones begin to creak he finds new ways to win. He opts to serve and volley with increasing regularity and it is wondrous to watch.

A host of sporting celebrities joined Federer’s parents in the Royal Box. Sachin Tendulkar, David Beckham and Matthew Pinsent stood to applaud his greatness as he departed Centre Court, signing the obligatory giant tennis balls on his way.

If Federer, at 32, was to become the first man in history to win an eighth Wimbledon title, it would surely be an achievement to match any other in all of sport.

Delight: Federer was keen to avoid another early exit from SW19

Disappointment: Santiago Giraldo failed to trouble Federer on saturday

The Swiss has yet to drop a set this year and has looked as comfortable as any of the big four in making it to the second week.

He also overcame the mental obstacle of advancing past the second round, where he suffered a shock exit at the hands of Sergiy Stakhovsky last year.

‘I’m very pleased to get through because I’m aware of the danger of certain players on grass,’ said Federer.

‘I’ve been able to get it done here many times before but not always as we saw last time.

‘I’m maintaining a good level of play, physically I’m in good shape — a few niggling things but nothing that worries me — I’m playing aggressively and serving well.’

In the fourth round, Federer faces Spaniard Tommy Robredo who beat him at the same stage in last year’s US Open.

Family time: Roger is looking forward to spending time with Mirka (above) and his new twins

His immediate focus was not on Robredo but a day out with his wife Mirka and two sets of twins.

Mirka gave birth to boys, Leo and Lenny, in May to join their five year old girls, Myla Rose and Charlene Riva.

‘I’ve been kept very busy off the court this week,’ said Federer. ‘But I’m really enjoying myself. It’s nice to have that distraction and spend time with the family.

‘We’ll have a family day and maybe go for a walk somewhere.

‘I am practising in the morning as usual and then we’ll spend the day together.’

He will be back on the grass at SW19 for a 78th bite at the cherry tomorrow.
