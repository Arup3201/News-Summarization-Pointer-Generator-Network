One in four schools and colleges fail to secure good grades for any of their pupils at academic A-levels.

For the first time, schools are being ranked according to how many sixth-formers achieve AAB grades at subjects preferred by leading universities.

The list includes maths, English literature, physics, biology, chemistry, geography, history and languages.

Magdalen College School in Oxford was joint top of the league table for the number of students who achieved the preferred university entry grades AAB

But tables published yesterday show that 600 sixth-forms had no pupils at the required level.

Nationally, 6.5 per cent of students achieved the AAB benchmark.

Private schools fared significantly better, prompting warnings that a new educational divide was ruling poorer pupils out of the race for sought-after university places.

St Paul’s Girls in London and Magdalen College School in Oxford – both fee-paying – topped the 2012 table in having 70 per cent of pupils at AAB level. Private schools took 150 places in the top 200, the remaining 50 largely being grammars.

Chris Skidmore, a Tory member of the Commons education select committee, said league table measures which highlighted performance in traditional subjects ‘shone a torch’ on under-performance.

Warning: Tory MP Chris Skidmore, who sits on the Commons education committee, said the tables demonstrated an 'educational divide' between the achievements of poorer and better off students

‘They will force schools to move into the 21st century and wake up to the fact that universities will require these rigorous qualifications,’ he said. ‘These results clearly show an educational apartheid, effectively an educational Berlin Wall, between some of the most affluent schools in the country and the most disadvantaged.

‘We must raise standards in the poorest areas. It would be wrong to level down our universities, which are some of the most respected in the world.

‘Every pupil, regardless of their background, must be encouraged to study the subjects that matter.

‘Too many pupils are not being put in a position of being allowed to take these subjects in the first place.’

The Russell Group – the university alliance that devised the AAB benchmark – advises sixth-formers to pick at least two key subjects to keep their course options open.

Wendy Piatt, director general of the group, said: ‘A-level choices really matter. Too few students realise that some subjects and subject combinations can keep open wider degree course options at leading universities.’

The number of schools facing intervention over poor results has doubled to 215 after targets were raised.

Separate figures revealed that the drift away from core academic subjects begins much earlier than sixth form in many state schools.

Of 176,538 high-achieving pupils at primary school, more than half were not entered for GCSEs in five basic subject areas.

Instead they were steered toward subjects seen as less rigorous such as dance and media studies.
