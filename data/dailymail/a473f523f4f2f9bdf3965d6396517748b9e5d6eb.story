On
 February 21, 2008, Aaron was arrested in Texas, when he was pulled over
 for speeding, and authorities found less than two ounces of marijuana 
in his car.

rehab after his manager stated he needed 'to heal some emotional and 
spiritual issues he was dealing with.'

getting involved in a fight in a nightclub and in 2005 he was arrested 
in Huntington Beach, California for drink driving.

Nick has also spoken out with his rocky road to recovery after a 10-year battle with drink and drugs in the past.

'I would make excuses to just go out to drink and party,' told Ellen DeGeneres in 2009. 'It was excessive ... Alcohol kind of kicked it off and then once the alcohol wasn't doing it for me I would lean on other things.'

He decided to get sober after he was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, a weakening of the heart muscle, in 2008.
