The grisly demise of Osama bin Laden has been immortalised on the TV screen and in computer games, and now it has been brought to the world of experience days. 

In St. Paul, Minnesota, ex-Navy Seal, Larry Yatch, offers people the chance to participate in a re-enactment of the Seal raid that killed Osama bin Laden in a Pakistani hideout.

After being kitted out in a flak jacket with a paintball gun, participants practice their aim by shooting at a target.

Tips include aim for 'anything above the moustache to below the turban', reports Gawker.

Then once enough adrenaline is flowing the participants are lead to confront terrorist Osama bin Laden in his secret hideout - which also doubles up as a bare room in Sealed Mindset's 10,000-square-foot studio.

Weapons poised, the Navy SEALS boot in the door and then kill Osama bin Laden in reign of bullets - paintballs.

He returns fire, but after putting up a fight, he slumps to the ground, covered in splodges of paint.

Then participants can pose next to his body, secure in the knowledge that the mission is complete.

One patron described the experience as 'exhilarating' to Minnesota Public Radio.

'This is so cool! My adrenaline is like so spiked right now!'

But the creator says it isn't all about shooting the world’s formerly most wanted terrorist.

'The biggest thing we’re trying to accomplish is giving people a sense of empowerment,' Yatch told Minnesota Public Radio.
