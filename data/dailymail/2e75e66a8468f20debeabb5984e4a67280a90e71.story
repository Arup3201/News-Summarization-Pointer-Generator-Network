A unique piece of Britain’s football heritage goes on sale to the highest bidder on Tuesday, when the late Sir Stanley Matthews’ FA Cup winner’s medal will be offered at Sotheby’s in London.

He won it in 1953 after one of the most famous FA Cup encounters, in which Blackpool beat Bolton Wanderers 4-3 in a game still known as the ‘Matthews final’.

The medal has been put up for sale by former television presenter and avid Stoke fan Nick Hancock, who bought it in 2001 for £26,000. The estimate this time, for what auctioneer Graham Budd calls ‘one of the most iconic items of football memorabilia’, is between £50,000 and £60,000.

‘The truth is when I bought it I had a job and no children and now I’ve children and no job,’ Hancock told Sportsmail. ‘So it seems like a good time to sell, and also it’s the centenary of Sir Stanley’s birth in February next year.’

Although it was during his 14 years with Blackpool that Matthews won the FA Cup, he began and ended his career with Stoke. For the past five years, Hancock has loaned the medal to the club, where it was displayed in the Stanley Matthews Lounge. 

He also hopes to sell the cap won by Gordon Banks for playing in England’s 1970 World Cup match against Brazil, in which he made one of the greatest saves ever, from a point-blank header by Pele. 

The cap is estimated to sell for between £15,000 and £20,000.
