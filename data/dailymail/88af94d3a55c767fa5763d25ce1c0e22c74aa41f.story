Terror: Retired care worker Penny Freeman, 69, said she could not leave her house without fear of attack from seagulls

A pensioner has claimed she was held hostage in her own home for four days - by seagulls.

Retired care worker Penny Freeman, 69, said she could not leave her house without fear of attack from the birds, which she said swooped and vomited on her.

The gulls set up camp in her back garden to protect a nest in the chimney - and 'flapped and pecked' at Ms Freeman every time she went outside. 

Ms Freeman said she and 67-year-old brother Jim were stuck inside her home in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, for four days.

She said: 'It was terrifying, absolutely terrifying. I felt like a prisoner. 

'I couldn’t get to my washing, I couldn’t even leave the house from the back door because the gulls wood swoop at me, squawk, flap their wings and try to scare me away.

'It was pandemonium - really frightening. The noise was appalling. The father bird would sit on the shed which is about three feet away from the house and flap its wings.

'They also warn off predators with vomit, so when we tried to go outside, they would vomit on us. It was really vile.'

Ms Freeman told how gulls first became attracted to her property around eight months ago when she started feeding some birds in her garden.

From then on, one of the gulls became increasingly aggressive, pecking at her windows with such force that she thought the glass would break.

The birds set up home on her roof and made a nest in her chimney.

Then at the end of last month, a fledgling fell from the roof into their garden- and since then the birds have not left its side.

She and her brother Jim, who ran a convenience store before he retired, said they have been waiting with baited breath for the little chick to learn to fly so its parents would leave.

'Every time it flapped its wings we thought, "this is it, we’re free",' Ms Freeman said. 'But eventually after about four days it did fly off and its parents followed too.

The retired residential home worker couldn't walk out of her house without the two birds - which had set up camp in her back garden to protect their chick - attacking her by flying at her

'They are like lizards, they are raptors and they have nasty scaly feet. I find them very threatening.'

Ms Freeman, who retired to the seafront less than a year ago, is now calling for action from the East Riding of Yorkshire Council.

She said: 'I would like to see some sort of Government help and advice for helping to keep them off your roof. 

'I would like the council to start taking this seriously because the centre of town is a mess - it is a real mess.

'I do really think that something should be done to make sure this doesn’t happen to other people. I like to see birds from a distance we have a wonderful bird variety in the garden.'

A spokesperson for East Riding of Yorkshire Council said culling is not a 'practical or economical method of control'.

For four days Ms Freeman, who lives with her 67-year-old brother Jim Fudge, was holed up inside her home in the picturesque seaside town

He said: 'Being harassed by the adult birds protecting their young can be difficult to deal with until the fledglings have left the area.

'The main way to resolve the problem is to proof buildings to prevent the birds nesting in the first place.

'Gulls can present a variety of problems, including noise, mess caused by droppings, damage to property, birds swooping on animals and people, and flues becoming blocked by nesting materials.

'The solution for individual property owners is to undertake bird-proofing measures to deter the gulls from roosting or nesting on their building.

Ms Freeman told how the torment began about eight months ago when she started feeding the birds in her garden - and now it's worse than ever

'A range of proofing methods exist, including netting and bird spikes to deter birds from roosting. The responsibility for proofing a building rests with the property owner, and not the local authority.

'Problems arising from the aggressive behaviour of birds stealing food from people’s hands are exacerbated by the feeding of birds by residents and visitors.'

Kay Harrison, of the RSPCA Bridlington, Driffield and District Branch, said: 'Regarding gulls, people should not feed them. They do get very protective over their young and young birds should be left alone.

'Their parents will be watching them. Injured birds can be taken to any vet who will deal with them with no charge to the finder.'
