European Commission officials will visit Gibraltar next week to assess claims of harassment by Spain as well as the legality of its border checks.

David Cameron demanded action from Brussels after Spain suggested a £43.50 fee could be imposed on anyone wanting to cross the border with the British territory.

The move will see officials from Brussels travel to the Rock on September 25 to assess the legality of the border checks.

Battle of Gibraltar: Prime Minister David Cameron demanded the intervention after Spain suggested a ¿50 (£43.50) fee to cross into British territory

Downing Street said the decision was a ‘welcome response to the Prime Minister’s call’.

The long-running dispute with Spain escalated this summer after Madrid suggested a 50 euro (£43.50) fee could be imposed on people wanting to cross the border to visit Gibraltar.

Spain has also imposed strict checks on traffic at the border with Gibraltar, leading to delays of up to seven hours, in protest at the creation of an artificial reef.

The Spanish say the 74 concrete blocks on the seabed disrupt an area used by its fishing boats, while the Gibraltarians say it was a necessary environmental measure.

Spanish police vessels have also made frequent incursions into Gibraltarian waters, including one incident in which officers fired pot shots at a British jetskier.

Solid as a rock: David Cameron has said he will only discuss the matter of Gibraltar if the locals wish to no longer belong to Britain

Brussels officials will now assess whether the border controls are consistent with EU laws on the free movement of people and goods.

In a statement yesterday the Commission said the move had been agreed following talks between Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso and Spain’s prime minister Mariano Rajoy.

Officials will also assess Spanish complaints about the artificial reef.

The Spanish government has been accused of stoking the row with the UK in order to distract attention from its dire domestic problems.

Mr Cameron pledged last week that Britain will ‘never’ discuss sovereignty issues with Spain unless the idea is supported by local people. He said he would like to see Gibraltar remain British forever.
