Once considered a taboo, online dating has become the go-to way of finding love in the twenty-first century - with over 9m Brits logging on in the last year, the stats speak for themselves.

But could the likes of Tinder, Match and OkCupid actually be ruining your love life rather than boosting it? One psychologist thinks so. 

New research shows that despite so many of us are logging on to find love, we are actually staying single for longer and one psychologist believes that because we are so dependent on communicating online, we've lost the ability approach potential love interests in real life.

Is Tinder ruining YOUR love life? Research has revealed that more people are single in this day and age and one psychologist thinks online dating is to blame 

Speaking to Look magazine's Jenny Stallard, Emma Kenny explained the theory behind the rise of the 'Tinderella syndrome'.

She said: 'The problem is, online dating breeds impatience and insecurity. You're suddenly inundated with so many potential love interests that you stop investing the same amount of effort into meeting actual people offline.

'Of course, it's going to be harder to take the plunge to start up a conversation with a stranger in a bar than sending an anonymous message to a man with a witty dating profile - especially because you can just log off if it gets uncomfortable, rather than finding yourself trapped in an awkward conversation. 

'But online dating was designed to enhance your love life - not replace it altogether.' 

Kate Taylor, Match's resident relationship guru, isn't convinced and believes that online dating helps our love lives enormously. 

Defending online dating, she told MailOnline: 'Mobile dating apps are actually helping people flirt and chat with each other - they make people feel more confident when they end up talking face-to-face.

'You already know so much about each other - from favourite foods, to films, job and hobbies - that conversation in person is much easier and less stilted. You’re not starting from scratch.

Vicious circle? One psychologist believes that online dating breeds impatience and insecurity. 'You're suddenly inundated with so many potential love interests that you stop investing the same amount of effort into meeting actual people offline,' she said

'Plus, meeting someone through your mobile gives shy people a helping hand. They’re no longer forced to stammer out a chat-up line, but have time to think about the perfect conversation opener.'

Kate, who met her fiancée on the website, maintains that people can't get addicted to using online dating sites and apps. 

She said: 'Remember people use the service to help them meet new people - not to hide behind a screen forever. It can be exciting to see how many singles are in your area, and receiving new emails is always a thrill, but that’s usually with the objective of getting to know someone in person. 

'It’s love that is the addiction, not the app!'
