'Deliberate inflation': Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint said the so-called Big Six paid £4billion more for power than the market rate

Energy firms ‘deliberately inflated’ the price they paid for electricity from their own power stations - leaving customers out of pocket by up to £150 over the last three years, it was claimed today.

The so-called Big Six - British Gas, SSE, E.ON, EDF, npower, and Scottish Power - paid £4billion more for power than the market rate, according to shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint.

The Labour politician accused the companies of paying over the odds to increase profits in other divisions of their companies or doing deals that were bad for customers.

She told The Guardian: ‘These figures reveal the full extent of the way consumers have been overcharged for their electricity.

‘Energy companies always blame wholesale costs when they put up bills, but it now looks like they could have deliberately inflated prices to boost profits from their power stations.

‘The time has come for a complete overhaul of our energy market. Labour will break up the big energy companies, put an end to the secret deals and force them to do all of their trading on the open market.’

Labour's analysis compared the price paid for electricity by the energy giants, the weighted average cost of fuel, with the average market price a year ahead provided to them by small supplier First Utility.

But Energy UK, which represents the big six suppliers, told The Guardian that Labour's research was wrong because the figures could not be compared.

A spokesman said: ‘It also covers losses, the energy element of reconciliation-by-difference (RBD) costs and balancing and shaping costs incurred by the supply.

‘The additional costs included in the weighted average cost of fuel make them a totally different figure to the basic wholesale market price.'

Ofgem, the government's watchdog for the energy industry, said today they were 'looking into' the accusations, but said the energy markets were so so difficult to analyse that they could not know for sue.

Ian Marlee, a senior partner at the organisation, told the Today programme: 'What we identified in our recent work was that actually there isn’t enough transparency to be able to actually look at that.'

However, he added that planned reforms to the industry would help eliminate any problems by increasing competition and removing the possibility for such loopholes.

He said: 'We’ve effectively created more transparency... [before the reforms] there wasn't enough trading going on at the point at which people wanted to buy energy. 'We’re making it far easier for independent suppliers to buy the electricity they need to compete with the big six.'

The accusation from Labour comes as Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey called for Britain to be part of a fully integrated European power market to bring bills down.

The Liberal Democrat dismissed Labour's plans for a price freeze and insisted a giant network of underground and under-sea cables allowing energy to be shifted between the UK and mainland Europe would push down prices.

He said there was an urgent need to build a giant network of electricity interconnectors across Europe, allowing vast amounts of energy to be moved between countries, driving down prices - shaving a possible 10 per cent off bills.

Mr Davey told The Independent: ‘Literally in the last three or four years, there has been a complete change in the differential between the North American price for gas and energy and the EU price for gas and energy.

‘That represents a strategic change in the terms of trade and is very significant. The EU needs to respond to this very quickly.’

Although there are some gas interconnectors already linking countries within Europe and electricity interconnectors between the UK and France, the Netherlands and Ireland, Mr Davey called for swift action to boost the system to ensure Britain can compete with the United States, where energy prices are far lower.

‘We need much better grid interconnectors around Europe to enable energy to flow across the EU. Connecting the UK with mainland Europe and different parts of the periphery of Europe with central Europe,’ he told the newspaper.

The government's energy regulator has said that changes to energy bills coming into force today will show consumers that 'there are savings out there' and stop them being 'bamboozled' by complicated tariffs.

The changes brought in by watchdog Ofgem mean that a wide array of tiered plans and discounts - which often did not provide the savings people expected - have been banned.

Now energy companies are limited to offering four tariffs for gas and four for electricity, which is meant to make it easier to compare companies and access the best deals.

Hailing 'the most radical set of reforms to the retail and wholesale market since competition began', Ofgem senior partner Ian Marlee told the Today programme that 'this market is getting easier and there are savings out
there they can make.

He said: 'We’re responding to what consumers have told us. What they want is that combination of choice and simplicity and that’s what we’re delivering.

'Putting all this package of reforms together is actually about making this market much more competitive so that there’s appropriate pressure on prices, profits and quality of service for consumers.

'The real message to consumers today is this market is getting easier and there are savings out there they can make.'

However, Ofgem was criticised by consumer group Which? for not going far enough to help customers.

A statement said that the reforms are 'a welcome step in the right direction', but 'do not go far enough... at a time when millions are struggling with the cost of living.'

‘This is why the Government should intervene with more radical measures including simpler pricing, greater transparency and scrutiny of the cost of energy policies, and the separation of supply from generation businesses.

'More must be done to keep prices in check and give consumers confidence that the price they pay for their energy is fair.’
