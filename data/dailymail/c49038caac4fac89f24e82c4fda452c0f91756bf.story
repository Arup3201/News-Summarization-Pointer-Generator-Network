It is an offence that in some countries could spawn a full-scale airport security alert.

But a South Korean woman was stopped at Guangzhou Airport in China after she tried to smuggle dozens of tadpoles past customs officials... in her mouth.

The bizarre encounter began when guards noticed the woman had a bottle of liquid in her hand luggage as she tried to board a plane home.

A tad too far: The woman was only caught with the tadpoles when she drank the liquid containing them rather than throw it away. But guards grew suspicious when she refused to swallow

Following international flight rules to the letter, the guards told the woman to drink the liquid or throw it away.

Opting for the former, the unnamed woman swilled the liquid in one attempt.

But when the beady-eyed officials noticed she had not swallowed, they demanded she spit it out into a bucket.

Upon doing so, dozens of tiny frog young rushed from her mouth to the horror of passengers and guards alike.

When confronted about the bizarre plan, she said she had been given the tadpoles by a friend and did not want to lose them.

Leapfrog security? The woman, from South Korea, was attempting to smuggle the tadpoles home through customs at Guangzhou Airport in China

Unconvinced, the guards made her throw the poles away before boarding the plane.

It is not the first time a passenger has attempted to smuggle live amphibians through airport security.

In 2011, two Japanese men were arrested 
at Los Angeles International Airport after attempting to smuggling more 
than 50 live turtles into the U.S in cereal boxes.

The
men, both from Osaka, were arrested at LAX as part of a 
investigation into live animal smuggling known as 'Operation Flying 
Turtle'.

The pair had 
hidden turtles and tortoises in snack food boxes inside a suitcase.

They were charged in a two-count criminal complaint
that alleges one count of illegally importing wildlife into the United 
States, a smuggling offense that carries a statutory maximum penalty of 
20 years in federal prison.

Both were jailed for 21 months and seven months respectively.
