The television historian David Starkey brought his profession into disrepute when he made controversial race remarks on BBC's Newsnight, a group of leading academics have said.

More than 100 historians, academics and graduate students signed an open letter criticising Starkey's failure to grasp the subtleties of race and class, which they said 'would disgrace a first-year undergraduate'.

The broadcaster provoked a race storm earlier this month when he appeared on the Newsnight programme as a panelist, discussing the UK rioting.

David Starkey sparked anger as he suggested that black 'gangster' culture had become the norm

He was branded a racist after claiming the riots happened because too many young white
people had ‘now become black’ and blamed a ‘violent, destructive and nihilistic’ gang culture, 
which he said was being embraced by many white and black people.

The open letter, published by the Times Higher Education magazine, is signed by more than 100 of Starkey's contemporaries.

In it, the signatories question why Starkey - who specialises in Tudor history - was invited by the BBC to talk about race riots when his academic works have nothing to do with it.

Describing the selection of Starkey as a panelist as a 'poor choice', the letter says: 'We are thus unsurprised by the poverty of his reductionist argument, which reflected his lack of understanding of the history of ordinary life in modern Britain. It was evidentially insupportable and factually wrong.

'His crass generalisations about black culture and white culture as oppositional, monolithic entities demonstrate a failure to grasp the subtleties of race and class that would disgrace a first-year history undergraduate.

'In fact, it appears to us that the BBC was more interested in employing him for his on-screen persona and tendency to make comments that viewers find offensive than for his skills as a historian.'

The signatories - which included academics from Cambridge and the London School of  Economics, both institutions where Starkey once taught - said he was 'ill-fitted' to speak on the matter.

It added: 'Instead of thoughtfully responding to criticism, he simply shouted it down; instead of debating his fellow panelists from a position of knowledge, he belittled and derided them.

'We the undersigned would therefore ask that the BBC and other broadcasters think carefully before they next invite Starkey to comment as a historian on matters for which his historical training and record of teaching, research and publication have ill-fitted him to speak.'

Even after the furore surrounding his comments, historian Starkey remained defiant.

The
broadcaster stunned his fellow guests on the BBC2 show, writer Owen 
Jones and black author and broadcaster Dreda Say Mitchell, by placing 
the blame for the riots squarely with a form of black male culture that 
he said ‘mitigated against education’.

He said: ‘A substantial section of 
the chavs have become black. The whites have become black. A particular 
sort of violent, destructive, nihilistic gangster culture has become the
fashion.   

‘Black and white, boy and girl 
operate in this language together. This language which is wholly false, 
which is a Jamaican patois, that’s been intruded in England and this is 
why so many of us have this sense of literally a foreign country.’

Dr Starkey denied he had 
said anything racist and said he stood by his comments, reiterating that in times of economic and political crisis, ‘plain speaking’ was 
needed.

Riots: Mr Starkey claims the unrest was caused by the spread of black gang culture

He said last month: ‘I said 
until I was blue in the face on the programme that I was not talking 
about skin colour but gang culture. A large group of whites have started
to behave like blacks. I think that is the most unracial remark anyone 
can make.’

Dr Starkey caused further outrage on 
Newsnight by claiming that if people listened to David Lammy, the MP for
Tottenham, on the radio, they would assume he was white.

Following his comments on Newsnight, he added: ‘David Lammy 
does sound white, so does [MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington] 
Diane Abbott, because they’ve had a white cultural experience. It’s one 
of the reasons they don’t have any street credibility. They have no 
contact with the young.'

The historian also revealed he had reread
former Minister Enoch Powell’s infamous ‘Rivers of Blood’ speech in 
light of the tensions.

He said: ‘His prophecy was absolutely
right in one sense. The Tiber didn’t foam with blood but flames 
lambent. They wrapped around Tottenham and around Clapham.’
