Aspiring model: Caine, 20, was killed at the scene of the crash on the M62 after the car she was travelling in was struck in a head-on collision

An asylum seeker was accused yesterday of killing a model in a head-on crash while driving the wrong way down a motorway.

A court was told that Rebecca Caine, 20, suffered fatal injuries when Wilfred Museka’s car ploughed into the Chevrolet Matiz carrying her.

Police said the 31-year-old Zimbabwean’s Renault Megane was on the wrong side of the M62 near Rochdale before the tragedy at 3am on Sunday.

Museka, who lives in Clayton, near Manchester, gave a roadside breath test and the sample has been sent for analysis.

He appeared before a district judge at Bury magistrates’ court yesterday charged with causing death by dangerous driving, fraud by false representation, driving without insurance and driving other than in accordance with a driving licence.

One of the charges related to claims he falsely represented he had a full UK driving licence between January and September this year.

Miss Caine, who was known to friends as Becky, lived in Leeds and was studying business at the city’s university.

She leaves behind a twin brother, Jack, a younger sister, Emma, her mother and partner, Susan and Russell, and her father Tim and his wife Joanne.

In a tribute, the family said: ‘Our lives are shattered and our hearts are broken into pieces.

‘She was a beautiful girl with her 
whole life ahead of her. She was embarking on a modelling career and 
would be finishing her final year of her business degree.

‘Rebecca was a bright light that 
attracted everything to her with her infectious laugh and her beaming 
smile. She saw the best in everyone and was loved by hundreds.’

The driver of the Matiz and two other 
passengers suffered minor injuries. Miss Caine died at the scene.

The 
M62 eastbound from junction 21 was closed for several hours while 
emergency services dealt with the incident.

investigating and we are providing support to the victim’s family.

Family statement

'I am 
keen to hear from anyone who saw the collision or a Renault Megane 
driving westbound on the eastbound  carriageway of the M62.’

Museka made no plea when he appeared in court and spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth.

District Judge Mark Hadfield remanded 
him in custody and adjourned the case until October 8 at Minshull Street
Crown Court in Manchester.
