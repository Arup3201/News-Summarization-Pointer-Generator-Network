Savannah Guthrie admitted that she has had a Botox injection on this morning's Today Show - and readily confessed to her shocked co-hosts that she would gladly consider having it done again in the future.

While discussing the rising number of men who are indulging in the non-invasive cosmetic enhancement during the show's 'Trending' segment, the 42-year-old anchor revealed that she had one Botox injection in 2009, but wasn't overly thrilled with how it turned out.

'I have done it, I did it in 2009,' she told Matt Lauer, Al Roker, Carson Daly and Josh Elliott while looking at a picture of herself during an interview with President Obama in October 2009. 'Really, I did it, I was working here [at the time].

'I have never done it again': The Today Show confessed that she only had the one injection

Now and then: Savannah, pictured left on today's show, admitted that she doesn't think she 'looks that good' in the image of her taken shortly after her Botox injection, right

'[I had it] in my forehead, that's where everyone did it. And you know what? I remember looking back and thinking, "I don't think that looks that good".'

Despite her reservations about her appearance after the injection, Savannah, who gave birth to daughter Vale, her first child with husband Michael Feldman, in August, admitted that she would definitely consider having Botox again.

'I have never done it again,' she said of the procedure. 'I'm not saying I wouldn't though; I would. And I'm mean, I'm definitely a candidate for Botox... Because of wrinkles. On your forehead, they're supposed to smooth them out.' 

Savannah's confession came as a surprise to her co-hosts, who were full of questions about the cosmetic procedure - and about the new mother's opinions on whether people should have it done.

'It's... a low-grade chemical weapon,' Josh joked, before adding: 'You know what, it's like a Zamboni, it just smooths you out.' 

When asked whether they would ever consider indulging in 'Bro-tox' - the nickname given to the injection when it is used by men - all four of Savannah's co-hosts made clear that it is not something they would ever consider.

'No.. I feel like we've earned [our wrinkles],' Josh said, before Al suggested that if Botox was ever 'sold as bacon', he might consider it. 

The Today Show men are not alone in their negative opinions of the injection. Earlier this year, actress Jennifer Aniston spoke out against the use of Botox, questioning why so many women feel pressured into appearing ageless.

'There is also this pressure in Hollywood to be ageless,' the 45-year-old told make-up artist Bobbi Brown in an interview for Yahoo Beauty.

Happy families: Earlier this month Savannah confessed that returning to work without her daughter felt like 'her heart is outside her body'

'I think what I have been witness to, is seeing women trying to stay ageless with what they are doing to themselves. I am grateful to learn from their mistakes, because I am not injecting s**t into my face.

'I see them and my heart breaks. I think, "Oh god if you only know how much older you look."' 

In February 2013, actress Nicole Kidman also admitted that she regretted having used Botox in the past and insisted that she would never again be tempted by the wrinkle-smoothing injection. 

'I did try Botox, unfortunately,' she told Italian newspaper La Repubblica. 'But I got out of it and now I can finally move my face again.'
