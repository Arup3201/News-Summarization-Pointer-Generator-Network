Freak accident: Sgt Robert Traxel, 34, of Union, Missouri died in Guatemala after being hit on the head by a falling branch while on a National Guard aid mission

A member of the National Guard was killed on a humanitarian mission after being hit by a falling tree branch during a helicopter take off.

Sgt Robert Traxel, 34, was on the ground in Guatemala when he was struck on the head when the chopper blades sliced through foliage.

He had been filming the flight as part of his work as a military journalist.

The married father-of-four, from Union, Missouri joined the 70th Mobile Public Affairs Detachment earlier this year after completing tours of Afghanistan in 2008 and in Iraq last year.

He was taking part in a two-week mission to the Central American country to provide medical supplies when he was killed on Monday.

He was a highly-decorated serviceman, receiving campaign stars among many other ribbons for his time spent on duty overseas.

His aunt Suzanne Corbett told St Louis Today: 'He enjoyed the service and dedication the military offered and he was 
proud to do it.'

The Missouri National Guard has not yet released a statement on the sergeant's death but was expected to give more information later today.

Sgt Traxel worked as a military journalist and filed video reports on the National Guard's humanitarian work.
