Bookies were counting the cost of Europe's Ryder Cup victory after a stunning final-day comeback was rounded off by a remarkable gesture of sportsmanship by America's Tiger Woods.

Jose Maria Olazabal's side recorded a 14½ to 13½ outright win in Medinah, Illinois, following a string of heroic performances by the likes of Luke Donald, Ian Poulter and Rory McIlroy.

They played their part in ensuring Europe retained the trophy they won two years ago, but it was Woods who handed them outright victory in the final match of the tournament.

By beating Francesco Molinari in the final pairing of the weekend he could have at least ensured a 14-14 draw for the USA.

He led going in to the final hole, but missed a three-foot par putt.
And in a show of sportsmanship, he declined to force Molinari to make a
putt from a similar distance, thus conceding the hole to the Italian 
and leaving their match all-square.

The gesture handed Europe an outright win that few would have predicted at the 
start of the day, leaving the European fans cheering - and the bookies 
fuming after they saw a flurry of bets placed from the optimistic few who did fancy the unlikely result.

The betting firms today admitted they were facing a combined 
multi-million payout in what was their most expensive ever Ryder Cup, 
despite the fact that just moments earlier they had been looking at their 
ideal result of a draw.

The unlikely comeback cost Ladbrokes 
£650,000 and Coral £400,000, while other bookmakers also reported heavy 
losses. Two punters even bet £500,000 on Europe to win as the odds fell 
last night.

Disappointment: It was a dismal three days for Tiger Woods in which he failed to win a single match

William Hill lost £500,000 - £400,000 of which was online, and £100,000 in stores. Paddy Power lost around £800,000, Betfred suffered a £400,000 hit and Sky Bet lost £500,000.

Industry experts said the late drama cost UK betting companies around £10million in total.

A Ladbrokes spokesman told MailOnline today: ‘No-one bets on a tie. It cost us just over £650,000 last night on Tiger’s miss. Tiger is not a bookie’s friend this morning.

‘At 8:20pm, Europe were 33/1 to win and USA were 1/50. It was a nightmare result. The USA were heavily backed pre-tournament. We were so close. It was our most expensive one ever.’

Europe's team staged a remarkable comeback to retain the Ryder Cup, battling from 10-6 down overnight - having trailed 10-4 - to beat the United States 14½ to 13½ in Chicago, Illinois.

After Europe reached the 14 points they required to retain the cup, Woods knew heading to the 18th tee that the USA could no longer win. He later claimed neither he nor the USA wanted to salvage a tie.

After Woods missed his final putt, he conceded one from a similar length to halve his contest with Molinari - a putt which he would have been expected to hold.

A Sky Bet spokesman told Sporting Life: ‘While it was impossible not to get caught up in such a fantastic victory, Woods's miss resulted in us taking a really heavy beating.

‘(But) our decision to pay out on 
both (Martin) Kaymer and Molinari securing the winning points will have 
made the night even more special for those who kept the faith.’

The European team said they drew 
inspiration for the remarkable turnaround from Seve Ballesteros, the 
Spanish former world number one who died last May aged 54 after a battle
with cancer.

A Coral 
spokesman told MailOnline: ‘It was the biggest betting Ryder Cup we've 
ever had. We took £1million. During the first two days confidence was a 
bit shot. People didn't really back Europe then.

‘We
were staring at the ideal result when Woods was at the final hole. Had 
it been a tie we would have kept everything we'd taken because no-one 
backs a draw. But it was a £400,000 hit.’

Coral said that Ian Poulter is now at 50/1, down from 150/1, to be crowned BBC Sports Personality of the Year - and in any other year the golfer would be favourite for the prize.

‘But after such a vintage year for British sport, he is still behind the likes of Bradley Wiggins, Andy Murray, and of course our great Olympians and Paralympians,’ the Coral spokesman added.

A William Hill spokesman told MailOnline: 'From a trading point of view we were USA supporters throughout. Tiger normally costs us because he wins, but this time he cost us because he lost.

'It was mad the way it changed it the last round. It was bonkers. It was an unbelievable night, but it cost us a fortune'

Paddy Power spokesman

'At the beginning of Sunday it was 7/1 for Europe to come back. When Ian Poulter was on the 12th on Saturday and it looked as if it would get even worse, Europe were at 9/1.'

A Paddy Power spokesman said: 'It was mad the way it changed it the last round. It was bonkers. It was an unbelievable night, but it cost us a fortune.'

And a Betfred spokesman said: 'It cost us a lot of money but sometimes you've got to pay out with a smile. It was a bad night for the bookies, but a great night for sport.'

USA captain Davis Love III described the result as a ‘little bit shocking’ and said it was reminiscent of the competition's tournament in 1999, when the US overhauled a deficit of 10-6 on the final day.

'We were staring at the ideal result when Woods was at the final hole. Had it been a tie we would have kept everything we'd taken because no-one backs a draw. But it was a £400,000 hit'

Coral spokesman

A devastated Woods added: ‘It was already over (on the 18th). We came here as a team - this is a team event. And the cup was already been retained by Europe, so it was already over.

‘You come here as a team and you win or lose as a team, and it's pointless to even finish. So 18 was just, hey, get this over with. Congratulations to the European team.’

That incident rounded off a dismal three days for Woods in which he failed to win a single match.

BBC Sport presenter Clare Balding said on Twitter: 'Well that is a gracious thing for Tiger not to make Molinari hole out. Europe come back from 10-4 down to win 14.5-13.5 Incredible #RyderCup'

The defeat was largely ignored on most US newspaper  front-pages, but the Chicago Sun-Times and Chicago Tribune both carried reports, with the headlines 'Shock and Awww' and 'Medinah Meltdown'.
