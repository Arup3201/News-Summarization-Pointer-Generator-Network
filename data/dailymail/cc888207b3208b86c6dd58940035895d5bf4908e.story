A cottage immortalised in a famous 1973 Hovis advert has gone on sale.

The bungalow on Gold Hill, Shaftesbury, Dorset, was made famous by the commercial which features a bakery boy pushing his bike to the top of the steep hill to make his last delivery.

Now on sale for £200,000, the house is the last stop on the boy's route and is compared to 'the top of the world' in the commercial which was voted Britain's all-time favourite in 2006.

The cottage in Gold Hill in Shaftesbury, Dorset was made famous by the 1973 Hovis bread advert

The 1973 advert, filmed on Gold Hill where the cottage lies was voted Britain's favourite TV ad in 2006

The two-bedroom bungalow which was 'Old Ma Peggoty's' house in the famous advert, has gone on sale after the deaths of its owners, Walter and Maisie Birmingham who lived there for 35 years after buying it in 1978.

The couple's son Richard said: ''All of the family have very happy memories of the house at Gold Hill.

'It is an amazing location and you can understand why it was chosen for the Hovis commercial.'

Though Mr Birmignham said the house needed 'quite a lot of work', his father lovingly maintained its garden which boasts stunning views of Dorset's Blackmore Vale.

The slope has become known as Hovis Hill by local residents after being immortalised in the television commercial

The cottage's owners Walter and Maisie Birmingham recently died, leading their son to put it on the market for around £200,000

Richard Birmingham, the late owners' son said his family had happy memories of Gold Hill and that it's easy to see why it was chosen for the Hovis commercial

Mr Birmingham said his late father was a keen gardener who lovingly maintained the house's gardens throughout the 35 years he lived there

'My late father was a very keen gardener and cultivated the 'middle' garden so successfully that they were self-sufficient in vegetables.'

Ben Marshall, of estate agents Woolley and Wallis, said the new owners will need to modernise the distinctive property.

He said: 'The property sits on an 
elevated position at the top of Gold Hill which is an iconic landmark 
and will forever be remembered for the Hovis TV advert.

The home has uninterrupted views over the Blackmore Vale, Dorset and a huge garden with hidden orchard

'It used to be a barn store and skittle alley, so the two bedrooms are quite long and narrow.

'It has a sun room at the back and from there you have these amazing and uninterrupted views of the Blackmore Vale countryside.

'You would redevelop that part of the house and create a large living space.'
