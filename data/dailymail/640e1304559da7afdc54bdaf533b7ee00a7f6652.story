Louise Port, 38, claimed more than £70,000 in housing benefits but has been spared prison

A former GMTV reporter who claimed more than £70,000 in housing benefits has been spared prison.

Louise Port, 38, has been handed an 18-month suspended sentence after being found guilty of ‘deliberate deception’ over a four-year period.

The case was brought by Westminster City Council after several months of investigation by fraud teams and Port was sentenced at Southwark Crown Court.

The ex-girlfriend of former Scotland manager Craig Brown failed to declare that she was receiving more than £1,000 a month in rent from a flat that she owned near Canary Wharf. She had £87,000 in equity on the property, according to the Evening Standard. Port was also receiving £1,150 a month from a property in the West End.

In all, she wrongly received £76,157.14 in housing benefit between September 2006 and August 2011. She used the money to pay off credit card debt, the paper reported.

Sentencing, Judge Anthony Pitt said she was not a ‘wealthy’ woman, and pointed out she was ‘clearly in difficulty’ when the offences were committed.

‘As an act of mercy’, because she suffers from epilepsy, he suspended her sentence for two years.

But he did impose 120 hours of unpaid work and three months’ curfew between 9pm and 6am – except on Fridays when Port works in nightclubs around the Vauxhall area.

According to the paper, Port wept as the sentence was passed.

Councillor Lindsay Hall, Westminster City Council’s fraud tsar, said: ‘She may have been used to getting up at the crack of dawn to entertain on TV, but now she is waking up to the fact that housing benefit fraud is a criminal offence and is the equivalent of stealing money straight out of the pocket of the taxpayer.’

Port, who now lives in Brentwood, worked at GMTV until 2006.

In 2008, she lost a disability discrimination and unfair dismissal claim against her former employer. Port claimed she was sacked for refusing to work night shifts because of her epilepsy.
