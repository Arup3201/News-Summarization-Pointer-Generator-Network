Dr Ashley Sibery walks free from court

A doctor who watched his wife collapse after injecting her with heroin so she could 'experience what the drug was like' has been handed a community sentence.

GP Ashley Sibery, 39, was convicted in September 2012 of giving his partner Sital the class A narcotic at their home in Edinburgh in April.

He watched her lose consciousness and struggle for breath moments after she took the deadly powder. The terrifying incident took place after she confronted him about his secret drug habit.

After tucking their three-year-old son into bed, the medic and father admitted to Sital that he had been using the lethal narcotic for two months.

She told him that if he didn't quit his addiction, she would end their marriage.

But despite the ultimatum, Sibery managed to persuade Sital into taking what was supposed to be his final fix.

The court heard how Sibery wanted his partner to experience the feeling that he got when he consumed the brown powder.

However, Sital collapsed and started having difficulties breathing.

The shocked paramedics who attended their home in the Scottish capital recognised the former accident and emergency medic and managed to save her life.

Sibery was then arrested and confessed his involvement in the potentially lethal incident to Lothian and Borders Police detectives.

Yesterday, Sheriff Elizabeth Jarvie QC decided not to send Sibery to prison after hearing how he had successfully completed treatment for his addiction.

Instead, the GP was ordered to perform 300 hours community service and placed on supervision by the authorities for two years after an Edinburgh Sheriff Court hearing on Tuesday.

Sheriff Jarvie also heard that his wife and his colleagues were sticking by Sibery, who is currently suspended from practising medicine by the General Medical Council.

Sheriff Jarvie added: 'I am persuaded that in these particular circumstances, the imposition of a non-custodial sentence is correct and in the public interest.

'I will impose a community payback order on you which will last for two years. You will also be placed on supervision and you will perform 300 hours community service.

'I hope that this sentence will allow you to utilise your talents within the community.'

Sibery pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable and reckless conduct before Sheriff Elizabeth Jarvie QC in a hearing earlier this year.

The court heard that prior to the incident, Sibery worked in the city as a general practitioner. He qualified as a medic in 2002 and had once worked in Accident and Emergency medicine.

Ms Rollo told Sheriff Jarvie that the pair had an argument about how Sibery had been behaving in the months leading up to April.

Mrs Sibery was concerned about how her partner had been acting.

The court heard that during an emotional exchange he confessed that he been spending £55 a day on his heroin habit for the last two months.

Procurator fiscal Karon Rollo said: 'He had admitted to her that he had spent the last two months injecting heroin into himself.

'She issued him with an ultimatum. She told him he had to stop taking the drugs or their marriage would be over.

'Bizarrely, he asked her if she wanted to try some. He told her that he had a small quantity of heroin remaining in the house and that he would give her it.

'He wanted her to experience the drug, to see what it was like. The heroin was then prepared and it was injected into her.'

An ambulance was called when Sital collapsed and started having breathing difficulties.

Ms Rollo then told the court that police arrested Sibery and interviewed him at a police station in the Scottish capital.

The doctor confessed to them that he had given his wife heroin and that he had an addiction problem. Ms Rollo added: 'The accused indicated that he had a heroin habit. He confessed to them that he had given his wife heroin.

'He told them that he wanted to relax her and deal with stress. He told the officers how she slipped into unconsciousness.'

The court also heard that Sibery - who was on bail for the offence - was now in the care of a consultant psychiatrist who was helping him to tackle his problems.

The court also heard that he and his wife were still together. Colleagues also provided the court with written statements about the good work that Mr Sibery has carried out as a doctor.

On Tuesday, defence solicitor Duncan Batchelor told the court that his client had recently completed a drug treatment programme.

Mr Batchelor revealed that Mr Sibery had recently been tested for drugs and the results showed that he hadn't taken any.

The court also heard that Mr Sibery had also started to help other addicts who were trying to tackle their problems.

After reading a report about Sibery's character, Sheriff Jarvie decided not to impose a custodial sentence on the doctor.

But she ordered Sibery to appear back in court on November 12 2013 in order for another sheriff to monitor his progress.

She added: 'You will reappear in this court next year.'
