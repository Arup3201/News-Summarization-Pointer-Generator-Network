A pet cat was blinded in a brutal attack and left for dead in a bin by thugs because he looks like Hitler, his shocked owner has claimed.

Baz, a seven year-old tomcat, has a distinctive patch of black fur under his nose, which resembles the Nazi dictator's moustache.

Owner Kirsty Sparrow became worried when her pet, who also has dark fun on the top of his head, failed to return home after a weekend on the prowl in Tredworth, Gloucestershire.

A neighbour found him days later, dumped in a bin having suffered severe injuries.

Ms Sparrow, 26, rushed Baz to the vet for emergency treatment, but the cat's left eye had to be removed because it was so badly damaged.

She believes her pet was targeted because of his unfortunate likeness.

'A lot of people say he looks like Hitler but he is so timid and gentle,' said Ms Sparrow, who has been left with a £600 care bill for her cat's treatment.

Lookalike: Many of Ms Sparrow's friends have told her that Baz looks like Adolf Hitler,  pictured in 1937

Rescue: Baz had disappeared and was found days later by a neighbour. He had been dumped in a bin

Injuries: After he was discovered in the bin Baz was rushed to a vet for emergency treatment. His eye had to be removed because it was so damaged

Cause: Vets do not think that Baz was hit by a car, as he had not suffered any other injuries

'I couldn’t believe the state of him. His eye was all swollen, it was like a marble.

'They said he was unlikely to have been hit by a car as there were no other injuries, and that he was probably kicked.

'I took a call at work from the vet to say he had been found in a bin, but was in a bad way. He’d been there for a while.

'It’s shocking someone would do something like that.'

Ms
 Sparrow, who has just left her Tesco job to go on maternity leave, 
added: 'I put a photo on Facebook of Baz as he has a distinctive black 
mark under his nose and asked if anyone saw him to contact me.'

Fear: Ms Sparrow became worried when her pet, who also has dark fun on the top of his head, failed to return home after a weekend on the prowl in Tredworth, Gloucestershire

Ms Sparrow, who has owned Baz since he was a kitten, says the cat has
 looked like Hitler since birth but it has never drawn any negative 
attention before.

She said: 'He's always looked like this way. I don't know why anyone would do that to any animal, no matter how they look.'

Ms Sparrow said that Baz's moustache gets a lot of attention from her friends.

'His moustache is what makes
 him, him. It's the first thing I asked about when I turned up at the 
vets, if his features were all still there. I was crying,' she said.

'People say that he looks like Hitler.
 He is so cute and he does look like Hitler. People can't believe it 
when I show them pictures. He's also bigger than my nan's dog.'

Other than the loss of his eye, Baz is
 set to make a full recovery following the attack but will be kept 
inside for quite some time.

 He is so cute and he does look like Hitler'

He will be heading back to the vet on Sunday to has his stitches removed. The bruising below his ribs will heal over time.

'The vet said not to let him out yet. I don't want to though. I'm scared it will happen again.'

The police are currently in contact with her grandmother, Cath, as Ms Sparrow is too shook up to deal with the situation.

'I'm quite traumatised by it so she is dealing with it for me. I was crying my eyes out at the vets,' she added.

Her
 grandmother said: 'To think there is someone out there walking the
 streets who can do something like that to a defenceless animal is 
frightening. It is absolutely horrific.'

Gloucestershire police are investigating the incident and appealing for witnesses.
