Police and the FBI are searching for two young Detroit siblings after their 27-year-old mother was found shot to death in a vacant house about six miles from her home.

The Wayne County medical examiner's office says an autopsy Tuesday determined Alicia Fox had been shot twice in the head. Her body was badly decomposed.

Detroit police spokesman Officer Adam Madera says Fox had been missing for several weeks. A family member found her body Monday night in the basement of the abandoned house after getting a tip from an 'unknown person.'

Body found: Alicia Fox's decomposing body was found in an abandoned house in Detroit

The Detroit Free Press reports that Michael Fields, Fox's uncle, found her body covered in blankets in a boarded up home on the 6800 block of Penrod St.

Neighbors said they last saw Fox and her children around Memorial Day at their home in northwest Detroit.

Missing are six-year-old Kaylah Hunter and eight-month-old brother, Kristian Justice.

Police are also trying to locate the father of the baby boy, 28-year-old Erin Justice.

Horrific discovery: Alicia Fox was reported missing on June 6 and last seen late May, before her body was found in the basement of this house

Justice and Fox were married and police say they lived together until recently.

Neighbors on Ardmore St where Fox had lived with her family told the Detroit Free Press that they saw Justice using a U-Haul truck to move out of the home about a week-and-a-half ago on May 27 or May 28.

An employee at U-Haul Moving and Storage at Livernois confirmed to the Detroit Free Press that Erin Justice had rented the U-Haul truck.

The father of Kaylah Hunter told police he last spoke with Fox on June 3. He reported Fox, his daughter and baby Kristian missing on June 6.

'If her husband is spotted pulling up from an abandoned in a U-Haul truck going in with hammers and tools, and then a couple of days later, whatever, her body's down there. We're not rocket scientists standing here but we're not idiots,' said Alicia Fox's uncle Michael Fields to My Fox Detroit.

'To sit there and to run away when people are looking for your family lets me know that you are one thing - you're a coward. And you're going to be a coward for the rest of your life. And you don't have to answer to anyone but God, and he's going to get you brother, believe that.'

No suspects have been identified.
