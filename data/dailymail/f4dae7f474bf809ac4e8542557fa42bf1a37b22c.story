A family of three - including a 10-year-old girl - have been killed in their home at an upscale Florida gated community and police say their bodies decomposed for up to three weeks before anyone found them.

Marcio Ferraz do Amaral, 45, his wife Cledione, 34, and their young daughter were only discovered Saturday when their landlord sent someone to check on them at their house on Lake Nona near Orlando because they were behind on rent.

The property manager who knocked on the door of the Ferraz do Amaral home was greeted with a horrible odor of rotting flesh. Deputies broke down the door and found the family dead in the garage - all the bodies were partially decomposed.

Gated: The family was found dead in a private, gated community that sits on a golf course. Authorities say they could have been dead for three weeks before their bodies were discovered

Now detectives are scrambling to determine how the family died. There was no sign of forced entry into the house. There appears to be no sign of trauma on any of the bodies.Â 

Police are investigating the possibility that the family died in a murder-suicide plot.

The Orlando Sentinel reports that the Ferraz do Amarals appeared to be a normal, happy family. Marcio was a pilot for a Brazilian airline. Cledione worked part time at Disney. They had been living the home in the exclusive Eagle Creek subdivision for five years.

'They were always very nice. No problems,' Gerald Mastro, the family's longtime friend and their landlord, told the Sentinel.

'When we went to Florida, we always visited them,' Mr Mastro, who lives in Chicago, said.

Trouble in paradise: The family's landlord said that they were three months behind on their rent and had recently experienced financial hardship

Mr Mastro told the Sentinel that the family had fallen into financial hardship recently. Marcio stopped earning money from his job with the airline and Cledione's income from Disney was not enough to keep them afloat.

The family fell three months behind on rent.

Cledione emailed Mr Mastro in November to apologize for being late on the rent. She promised to FedEx the money to him.

Mr Mastro waited three weeks and did not hear anything from the family.

That's when he sent a property manager to the house to check on them.
