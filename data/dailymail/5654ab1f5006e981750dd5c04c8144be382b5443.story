An extremely rare set of 400-year-old playing cards made of silver and gold that were owned by a princess have been discovered.

The extraordinary deck of ‘silver cards’ gilded with gold were first sold at auction at Christie’s auction house for £2,421,123 in 2010.

Recently a historian described them as one of only five known decks of silver cards and the only complete set.

Gilded with gold: The set of 'silver cards' is one of only five known decks and the only complete set and was created around 1616

Legend has it that the cards were owned by Portuguese princess Infanta Carlota Joaquina, who married a prince in Portugal before fleeing to Brazil when Napoleon’s armies marched into Iberia in 1807. Stories say she took the set with her.

Timothy Schroder, a historian specialising in gold and silver decorative arts, recently wrote in his book: ‘Only five sets of silver cards are known today and of these only one — the Zilkha set (referring to the current owner) — is complete.

‘They were not made for playing with but as works of art for the collector's cabinet, or Kunstkammer.’

Creating the silver cards was a hazardous job as each of the 52 cards was gilded using mercury, a deadly chemical, a process which is illegal today.

Even in Renaissance times, people knew the process was dangerous.

Risky process: Mercury was used to gild the gold to the silver - a process which is illegal today and even in Renaissance times, people knew the process was dangerous

Mr Schroder was quoted in Live Science saying: ‘I don't think they quite understood why it was dangerous, but they did appreciate the dangers of it.

‘You ground up gold into kind of a dust, and you mix it with mercury, and you painted that onto the surface where you wished the gilding to appear.’ 

He explained that the mercury disperses in the kiln in a process ‘that would leave the gold chemically bonded to the silver’.

Prince Carlota is thought to have given the silver cards to the wife of Felipe Contucci, a man who helped her try to take the Spanish crown after Napoleon forced her brother, Ferdinand VII, to abdicate.

The cards were created in Germany around 1616 and engraved by Michael Frömmer at a time when no standardised style of cards existed.

At the time, different parts of Europe had their own styles of cards. This set uses a suit that has been seen in Italy with coins, swords, cups and batons each suit with a king, a knight, a knave, and pip cards ace through ten.

Each card is about 3.4 x 2 inches and blank on the back.
