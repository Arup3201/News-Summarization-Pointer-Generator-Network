Raoul Moat died on 10 July 2010, aged 37, after a six-hour stand-off with police

Firearms officers who shot crazed gunman Raoul Moat with an untried, untested and unapproved Taser were yesterday cleared of any wrong-doing.

Moat, 37, deliberately pulled the trigger of his sawn-off shotgun at the end of a tense six-hour stand-off with police last July after one of the Taser rounds struck his arm, an inquest jury found.

The gunman, who had been on the run for seven days, had been cornered by firearms officers on the banks of the River Coquet in Rothbury, Northumberland.

But the jury returned a suicide verdict yesterday, concluding there was no evidence to suggest the 500-volt Taser round which hit his arm caused him to inadvertently pull the trigger.

Although Moat momentarily rocked backwards after being hit with the Taser – prompting him to cry out in pain – he instantly resumed his position, pressed the gun back to his temple and defiantly pulled the trigger.

John Beggs QC, representing Northumbria Police during the £1million, three-week inquest, said he hoped the jury’s findings would finally ‘lay to rest’ the ‘ill-informed’ criticism that had previously emerged over the use of the Taser.

Meanwhile an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission cleared the officers of misconduct.

But the watchdog noted that they had not received any proper training before being handed the weapon.

And questions will remain over the deployment of a weapon which has now been withdrawn from use by the Home Office.

It was the first, and last, time the Extended Range Electronic Projectile Taser has ever been used in the UK, the inquest heard.

Dubbed the ‘super Taser’, the XREP has a range five times longer than the conventional version and delivers a shock lasting 20 seconds, four times longer than the those currently in use.

1 Moat warned his girlfriend, Samantha
Stobbart, he would 'go crazy' after she split up with him

2 Police found a noose
and six suicide notes in his Fenham home in Newcastle, when it was raided

3 He told police negotiators he got so hungry he ate dead mice while living rough around Rothbury, Northumberland

4 At the climax of the stand-off with police, Moat moved his sawn-off 
shotgun from under his chin to his right temple, causing police to 
believe he was about to kill himself

5 The XRep Taser round 
which hit him on the arm probably only caused a small electrical 
discharge, if it did at all, and it did not penetrate his skin

6 Being shot by a Taser did not cause him to accidentally pull the 
trigger of his sawn-off shotgun, according to an expert on the effects 
of electrical pulses on the nervous system

7 Witnesses said there was a gap of up to two seconds between Moat being hit by the Taser and him pulling the trigger8 The XRep Taser shotgun cartridges fired from X12 shotguns are 
'conceptually' sound but in tests failed to work 'more often than not', 
according to the Home Office

9 Moat's heart was still beating when he arrived at Newcastle General Hospital, despite a brain injury that was non-survivable

on to the hospital floor after medics stopped operating - it had probably lodged in the hood of his top

Last night Moat’s half-brother Angus, 41, said he still believed using it was a ‘mistake’. He also criticised the way the inquest was set up.

‘A coroner’s inquest is intended to be non-adversarial, however at times it has felt like this inquest has been a three against one contest,’ he said.

‘Barristers representing Northumbria Police, ProTec [which supplied the Taser] and individual West Yorkshire officers were all pushing in one direction to justify police tactics and strategy.

‘The only opposition was legal representation for my family.’

Moat, who had been released from prison just 48 hours before his shooting rampage in July last year, critically wounded his ex-girlfriend Samantha Stobbart, 23, and killed her new lover, 29-year-old Christopher Brown.

He also blinded PC David Rathband, 43, who was blasted twice as he sat defenceless in his traffic car at a roundabout.

After Moat was cornered on July 9, negotiators attempted to persuade him to give himself up, but in the early hours of the following day he made a ‘deliberate’ movement with the gun, the inquest was told.

It was then that two firearms officers from West Yorkshire Police – working as part of an operation led by Northumbria Police – fired a round from the controversial XREP Taser, which had not been approved by the Home Office.

The inquest jury of five women and five men concluded the use of the XREP was ‘appropriate’.

The jury said that after Moat was struck: ‘The gun momentarily moved away from his head.

‘Mr Moat corrected himself to his original position and repositioned the gun to his temple. Mr Moat then discharged the gun and shot himself.’

Meanwhile the IPCC report concluded that there was no evidence officers were guilty of misconduct.

Last night Northumbria Police Chief Constable Sue Sim said: ‘Our use of the XREP shot gun Taser was carefully considered. The evidence was clear. There were simply no other options available to us to stop Moat from taking his own life.’
