Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer became the latest NFL player in this week of shame to be sidelined by his team due to off-field legal issues.

The 25-year-old, who was arrested by Phoenix police after two alleged aggravated assault incidents in July, was deactivated as the Cardinals moved to bench him.

Dwyer was arrested on charges of one count of aggravated assault causing a fracture, one count of aggravated assault involving a minor, two counts of criminal damage and one count of preventing the use of a phone in an emergency, and assault.

The Cardinals released a statement, which was published on www.nfl.com and read: 'We became aware of these allegations this afternoon when notified by Phoenix police and are co-operating fully.

'Given the serious nature of the allegations we have taken the immediate step to deactivate Jonathan from all team activities.

'We will continue to closely monitor this as it develops and evaluate additional information as it becomes available.'

It continues a tumultuous week for the NFL as it deals with domestic violence issues involving former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, Carolina Panthers defensive end Greg Hardy and Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson.

Last week, Rice was released by the Ravens and suspended indefinitely by the NFL after new video emerged showing him punching his wife.

Hardy was convicted in July on charges of assault on a female and communicating threats.

The Vikings suspended Peterson indefinitely from all team activities on Wednesday after he was indicted on a count of reckless or negligent injury to a child, accused of using a tree branch to discipline his son.
