Miami Dolphins player Derrick Shelby has been arrested for allegedly trespassing and resisting arrest without violence following a disturbance at a Fort Lauderdale nightclub.

The defensive end allegedly caused a disturbance about 2am on Saturday and was asked by security guards to leave Cyn Nightclub, also called Off the Hookah. 

When he refused, police were called and he was arrested, the Miami Herald reported.

Shelby, 25, has been released on bond and plans to enter a not guilty plea in court on Monday , defense attorney Danny Rosenberg told the Herald.

'Derrick maintains his innocence,' Rosenberg told the newspaper. 

Miami Dolphins defenseive end Derrick Shelby, 25, was arrested at a Fort Lauderdale club on Saturday. His attorney, Danny Rosenberg, says 'the only place the bruising can come from is from the police'

In his booking mugshot, his lips and face are covered in blood — his left eye and lips badly swollen.

Rosenberg told the Herald that the picture 'speaks volumes' given Shelby's charge of resisting arrest without violence.

'There was no report of a fight (in the club) or anything like that,' Rosenberg told the Palm Beach Post. 'The only place the bruising can come from is from the police. 

'I don’t want to get into that too much. When you see charges of resisting without violence and you see photos like that there’s a lot of conflicting information.' 

Shelby is playing his third season with the Dolphins. He was undrafted out of Utah in 2012 and has appeared in all four of Miami's games this season, recording six tackles, two sacks and recovering a fumble. 

'We are aware of the reports regarding Derrick Shelby and are in the process of gathering information,' the Dolphins said in a statement.

Shelby is expected for practice Monday morning.

The Dolphins have not yet said whether they will discipline the defensive end.
