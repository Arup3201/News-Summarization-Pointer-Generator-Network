The former RAF pilot who stumbled  on the French Alps gun massacre described yesterday the carnage that confronted him.

Brett Martin, 53, said he initially 
thought there had been a terrible car accident but then saw a 'lot of 
blood and heads with  bullet holes in them'.

He compared what he saw to a scene from the TV crime series CSI: Miami.

First on the scene: Brett Martin described finding the murdered Al-Hilli family as 'like something out of a Hollywood movie'

Mr Martin was cycling up a remote mountain road near Lake Annecy when he came across the bloodbath in a secluded car park.

He was the first witness to arrive at the picturesque spot where British engineer Saad Al-Hilli, 50, from Claygate, Surrey, his dentist wife Ikbal, 47, and her mother Suhaila Al-Allaf, 74, were each shot twice in the head.

Speaking publicly about the murders for the first time, Mr Martin revealed how he found the Al-Hillis' daughter Zainab, seven, stumbling around. From a distance it looked as if she was 'larking about like a child would'. But as he approached he realised she was bleeding and moaning.

Zainab had been shot in the shoulder and badly beaten around the head. Nearby was the family BMW containing the bodies of her parents and grandmother.

Next to it lay the body of Sylvain Mollier, 45, a French cyclist who police believe may have been killed because he was in the 'wrong place at the wrong time' and witnessed the attack.

The BMW's wheels were still spinning and its engine was revving. Inside, Mr Martin saw the three bodies.

The French prosecutor leading the murder hunt said yesterday that the motive lies in Britain. Eric Maillaud was speaking in Woking after travelling to Surrey to meet British police officers working on the case.

He said it was ‘without any doubt that the reasons and causes have their origins in this country’. The comments add weight to the theory that the family, from Claygate, were killed because of a dispute in Britain.

The French-led investigation is focusing on Mr Al-Hilli’s work, his relationship with his relatives and links to his native Iraq. Yesterday officers continued to search the family’s home.

Mr Martin, whose full name is William 
Brett Martin, told the BBC how when he first arrived he smelled 'burning
 rubber and that sort of hot burning engine smell'. He said: 'It seemed 
like a good idea to turn the car engine off, so I went around to the 
driver's side and I needed to break the window to get in.

'But the window was already “star 
crazed” anyway and I noticed some holes and I was starting to think “is 
that a bullet hole?” as I was breaking the window. I had my cycle gloves
 on so I literally pushed the window, as it was already crazed, and 
turned the ignition off.

'Things were a lot calmer then because
 the engine wasn't revving, the wheels weren't spinning and I started 
taking stock of the people who were inside. It became fairly evident 
that the injuries of the people inside didn't match what one would think
 people would be like from a car accident in a car park.

'Then I moved around to the other side
 and looked into the rear. I have never seen people who have been shot 
before for real, apart from Hollywood stuff, but it seemed to me to be 
just like a Hollywood scene.

'And if someone had said “cut” and 
everyone had just got up and walked away, that would have been it. But 
unfortunately it was real life. So it became quite obvious now, taking 
stock, that it was a gun crime.' Asked about the condition of the people
 inside the car, he said: 'Well if you have seen CSI: Miami it was 
pretty much how you would imagine a set from CSI: Miami would be like. 
There was a lot of blood and heads with bullet holes in them.'

Mr Martin is regarded by French police as a potentially vital witness – someone whose identity they had been keen to protect.

But yesterday, in an unexpected move, 
the aviation consultant and former British Airways training captain 
agreed to give a TV interview about the horrific events on Wednesday of 
last week. Remarkably, he delivered his chilling testimony in a very 
matter of fact way.

Continuing his account, he said: 'Now I
 was getting a little anxious, because I thought maybe there is some 
crazy person in the woods. I pulled out my mobile phone and tried to 
call the rescue services and of all the moments in the world to have no 
signal on your mobile phone, that was it.'

Mr Martin gently put Zainab 'in a 
recovery position' and set off on his bike to get help. The girl is now 
recovering in hospital in France.

Her four-year-old sister Zeena escaped
 unhurt by hiding under her mother's body during the attack. She was 
discovered in the BMW by police eight hours later.

Mr Martin spent his childhood in New 
Zealand and lives with his wife and family in the south of England. He 
was in France carrying out maintenance on his holiday home when he 
decided to go for a cycle ride at about 2.30pm last Wednesday.

After four miles as he rode through 
Combe d'Ire forest near Chevaline  he came upon the appalling scene he 
described so graphically yesterday.
