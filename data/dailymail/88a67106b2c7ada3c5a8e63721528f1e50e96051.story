The autopsy of a 17-year-old girl who was killed by Denver authorities disproves the police department's claim that she was driving at the officers when she was shot, according to her family.

Jessica Hernandez suffered four gunshot wounds and had marijuana and a small amount of alcohol in her body when she was killed on January 26. 

Two bullets entered through the left side of her chest and traveled to the right side of her body. A third bullet traveled from her left pelvis to her right thigh, according to the report. 

Qusair Mohamedbhai, the family's attorney, said this proves Hernandez was shot from the driver's side of the car. He says this contradicts officers' claims that they killed Hernandez as she was driving directly toward them.

The family of Jessica Hernandez, 17, said a new autopsy report disproves the Denver police department's claim that she was driving at the officers when she was shot and killed 

Hernandez was shot twice in the left side of her chest and once in the left pelvis. The family attorney said this proves that she was shot from the driver's side of the car 

'The wound path and trajectory of the bullet that likely killed Jessica Hernandez undermines the version of events as indicated by the Denver Police Department,' he said in a statement. 

Mohamedbhai said the autopsy was 'objective evidence' that proved Hernandez was not to blame 'for her own death'. 

Hernandez also had abrasions on her nose and chest that were received postmortem, according to the report. 

Mohamedbhai said they confirm the police department's 'inhumane treatment' of Hernandez. 

Witnesses said officers pulled Hernandez from the car and handcuffed her even after she was motionless. 

It is not clear how many times she was shot, as the report states two of her gunshot wounds may have been caused by one bullet. 

Retired Colorado police chief and use-of-force expert Dan Montgomery said other factors needed to be considered and that conclusions couldn't be drawn from the autopsy report alone. 

He said it still needs to be known how the officers were positioned, what they tactics were in approaching the car and whether they put themselves in danger. 

'It's like putting a giant jigsaw puzzle together, and we've got two tiny little pieces,' he said. 'More are going to start coming into place.' 

The Hernandez family has requested an independent autopsy.     

Denver police say Jessica drove a stolen car at two of the department's officers, hitting one of them in the leg

Mrs Hernandez said: 'I want another autopsy on my daughter so we can know how much damage they did.'

'I want to know, how did this happen? I want to know everything.' 

Police have said the two officers involved in the shooting, Daniel Greene, a 16-year-veteran, and Gabriel Jordan, a nine-year-veteran of the force, fired after Hernandez drove a stolen car into one of them. 

Jordan suffered a fractured leg. Both officers are currently on administrative leave, which is standard procedure following an officer-involved shooting. 

A passenger in the car disputed that account, saying police opened fire before the vehicle struck the officer. 

Police have admitted no one in the car, which contained five people, was armed.  

A passenger in the car, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of safety concerns, said Hernandez lost control of the vehicle because she was unconscious after being shot.

The passenger said officers came up to the car from behind and fired four times into the driver's side window as they stood on the side of the car, narrowly missing others inside.

Mrs Hernandez criticized the way police handled her daughter after she was shot.

She said: 'They dragged her on the floor and threw her down like a piece of garbage,'

The shooting occurred amid a national debate about police use of force fueled by racially-charged episodes in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City.

Investigators in the Denver case will be relying on witnesses and police accounts because the department has only just started to buy body cameras for its officers and Jordan and Greene were not yet outfitted. 

Denver does not use in-car dashboard cameras.

District attorney spokeswoman Lynn Kimbrough said the case was still ongoing and she could not offer a timeline on when the probe would be complete.   

The U.S. Supreme Court has held that officers may not use deadly force to stop a fleeing suspect unless the person is believed to pose significant physical harm. 

Policies vary and some departments have banned or discouraged the practice. 

The police department and independent monitor Nicholas Mitchell are both looking at how national standards compare to Denver's policy.

The city currently allows officers to fire at moving cars if they have no other reasonable way to prevent death or serious injury.

Denver's policy urges officers to try to move out of the way rather than fire.

It states: 'An officer threatened by an oncoming vehicle shall, if feasible, move out of the way rather than discharging a firearm.'
