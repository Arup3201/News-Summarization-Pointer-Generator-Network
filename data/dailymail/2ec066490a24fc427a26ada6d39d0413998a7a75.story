A 25-year-old man with terminal cancer got his wish fulfilled when he married his longtime girlfriend in the New York City hospice where he is living out his last days.

Christopher Robinson and 23-year-old Terry Torres married Thursday at the Metropolitan Jewish Health System hospice in Brooklyn.

Robinson was diagnosed with a rare form of renal cancer last summer and given a few months to live. He checked into the hospice last week.

I do: Christopher Robinson, 25, and Terry Torres, 23, said 'I do' at a Brooklyn hospice where the groom is dying from an aggressive form of renal cancer. Their adorable two-year-old son, C.J. witnessed the nuptials

Bad luck: In 2013, Robinson was shot five times by a burglar. He underwent eight surgeries and spent several months in the hospital. In August 2014 he was found to have cancel and given months to live

Dying wish: Knowing that his time was limited, Robinson checked into MJHS Hospice, determined to marry the woman he once fell in love with in college - despite his fragile body and reliance on an oxygen tank

His doctors are giving him few more days but it didn't stop his bride from saying 'I do'.

Robinson was determined to marry the woman who had already stayed by his side for better and worse.

A city clerk brought the licensing paperwork to Robinson and the hospice staff got decorations, a cake and a musician.

Christopher's wedding wish came true in less than a day and the wedding vows were exchanged together with the rings. 

Team work: In 24 hours, the city clerk brought the licensing paperwork to him and the hospice staff took charge of decorations, the cake and brought in a musician

Soul mates: The pair met four years ago when they were both attending college in upstate New York

Robinson says the wedding was 'like something out of a dream.It was beautiful.'

There wasn't a dry eye  during the touching nuptial at the MJHS Hospice residential inpatient unit.

The couple's son, CJ, served as the dashing ring bearer, with a sweet accessory that only a child can pull off...a balloon tied to his little wrist.

Terry has been by Christopher's side in sickness and in health.

The two met each other in a New York upstate college.They lived together, struggled hard and worked several jobs at once  in order to buy a place they can call their own.

Christopher suffered five gunshot wounds in 2013 and had to undergo multiple surgeries. 

He was then diagnosed in August 2014 with a rare and aggressive form of renal cancer. 

By the time it was discovered, doctors said it had already spread to his lungs and he only had a few months left to live. 

Last week, he had to rely on an oxygen tent and was too frail to move. Incredibly, he was able to stand for a few moments at his own wedding. 

There's no telling how many days more will the newlyweds will share together but the smile on his face at his wedding says it all after marrying his love. 

'She's the love of my life, she's my friend and my moon, my stars, my sky, she's my everything,' he said.

Beautiful: 'She's the love of my life, she's my friend and my moon, my stars, my sky, she's my everything,' Christopher Robinson said of his new bride

Just married: The couple doesn't know how many days are left for them to stay together, but one thing for sure, Christopher will leave content

With this ring:  Terry stayed by Christopher's side for better and for worse and through sickness and in health. The newlyweds have a 2–year-old son together
