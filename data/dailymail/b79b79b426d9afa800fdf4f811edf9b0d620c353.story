Artists from all over the world decorated their naked bodies in an array of amazing colours and intricate designs for this year's World Bodypainting Festival.

The artists, who descended on a small Austrian village from 47 countries, helped transform Poertschach am Woerthersee into an explosion of colour and creativity.

The event is described as an 'art, music and fashion show' and this 
year's theme was Pop Art.
