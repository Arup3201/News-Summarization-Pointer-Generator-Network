Barclays Premier League footballers will be warned in the next fortnight that they could face retrospective action if they follow the example of England cricketer Moeen Ali and make a public show of political support on the football pitch.

In light of the current conflicts engulfing the Gaza Strip, Ukraine, Libya and Syria, both the Football Association and the Premier League are acutely aware of the sensitivities but a new amendment to the Laws of the Game by FIFA will see a global crackdown on such political statements this season.

Only this week, English cricketer Moeen Ali was banned from wearing 'Save Gaza' and 'Free Palestine' wristbands by the International Cricket Council and even though athletes may argue the message is humanitarian, rather than political, football's governing bodies will follow the lead of their cricket counterparts in clamping down on this.

As it transpires, similar wristbands would not be permitted by the FA as jewellery and accessories that are not worn for the sole purpose of protecting a player are already banned.

However, a new change to FIFA laws will also stiffen the resolve of the governing bodies. Previously, footballers were allowed to reveal a personal message or image on their undershirts but the law change, which comes into effect for the 2014/15 season, introduces a total ban against any messages being revealed by footballers.

The amendment to the FIFA rules sees a change to Law 4, entitled The Player's Equipment, and it now reads: 'Players must not reveal undergarments that show political, religious, personal slogans, statement or images, or advertising other than the manufacturer logo.'

'A player/team of a player that reveals an undergarment that shows political, religious, personal slogans, statements or images, or advertising other than the manufacturing logo will be sanctioned by the competition organiser or by FIFA.'

If, when celebrating a goal, a player was to lift their shirt to reveal any kind of message, the referee would be expected to include the incident in their subsequent post-match reports.

Retrospective action would then be taken by the FA or FIFA against the footballer. It would then be up to an FA disciplinary commission to decide the punishment, whether it be an official warning, a fine or a suspension.

Banned: Players are not allowed to show messages like Mario Balotelli's infamous 'Why Always Me?' t-shirt

A senior FA source confirmed to Sportsmail: 'We apply FIFA's rules which cover player equipment and include the banning of political messages.'

The new law would include potentially volatile messages about international politics but also tongue-in-cheek ones such as Mario Balotelli's infamous 'Why always me?' statement.

The FA are responsible for enforcing discipline in English football but Premier League officials will also hold their annual pre-season meetings with leading managers in the coming weeks, where clubs will be briefed on these matters. The PGMOL (Professional Game Match Officials Limited) will also pay a pre-season visit to all squads to clarify the amendments to the Laws of the Game for this season. The stance will also apply to UEFA competitions such as the Champions League and Europa League.

The strict changes to the legislation were agreed in March by the International Football Association Board and came into effect for the World Cup.

However, following the the intensification of tensions, particularly between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas, there is growing concern that some individuals may follow in Ali's footsteps and attempt to show their support for certain factions. 

Vocal: QPR's Joey Barton has spoken out about the situation in the middle east on Twitter

On Twitter, QPR midfielder Joey Barton has been outspoken in his opposition against Israel's offensive in the Gaza Strip. On Friday, he posted 17 Tweets in just over one hour, in which he questioned the existence of God and shared a picture that appeared to show Palestinian children severely injured.

He then wrote: 'If God does exist. Then he has to have allowed this to happen. Which makes him well, a bit of a c*** really...#f***organisedreligion.'

There is, however, an area of confusion developing as some would argue that expressing such volatile opinions on social media arguably constitutes a more powerful statement than unveiling a message on the field.

On Friday, the FA would not comment on Barton's four-letter rant and it is understood that they recognise a divide between a player promoting political views on the pitch - wearing the colours of his team and representing the Barclays Premier League - and writing on a personal online account.

Nonetheless, Barton has 2.65m followers and there is an acknowledgement that players must behave responsibly and there are precedents in place to impose sanctions on footballers for online behaviour that is deemed to be offensive.

Earlier this year, Tottenham Hotspur defender Benoit Assou-Ekotto and Hull City forward Yannick Sagbo were both punished when they Tweeted their support for Nicolas Anelka after the Frenchman was banned for five matches when he celebrated a goal for West Brom with the quenelle gesture, a signal interpreted by most to be an inverted Nazi salute.

Any sanctions for improper conduct on social media would, however, be down to the FA's interpretation alone, while on-pitch messages are now enshrined into FIFA law.

QPR, Barton's employers, refused to discuss the player's actions when approached by Sportsmail on Friday afternoon. It was telling, however, that the player returned to Twitter late on Friday evening to say: 'Shouldn't have used foul language in and around religion before but was angry at what I'd seen. Apologies if I offended anyone.'
