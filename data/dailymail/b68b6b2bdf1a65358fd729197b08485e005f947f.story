Former Beatle Paul McCartney has left Japan after recovering from a viral infection that forced him to pull out of his Asian concert tour.

The 71-year-old left on a charter flight on Monday with Japanese media reporting he had headed for London.

McCartney was hit by the mystery bug on May 16 - just one day after he landed in Japan ahead of his Out There tour.

He called off the sold-out Japan tour, much to the disappointment of fans - some of whom had 
paid 100,000 yen ($980) to see him.

McCartney was also scheduled to perform at a Seoul stadium on May 28. It would have been his first concert in South Korea.

Today the concert organisers said in a statement: 'Paul McCartney himself hopes to return to Japan for more concerts as soon as possible.'

When he fell ill last week, the Beatle said:
 'Unfortunately my condition has not improved overnight. I was really 
hoping that I'd be feeling better today. I'm so disappointed and sorry 
to be letting my fans down.'

A
 message on the iconic star's website said: 'Doctors have ordered Paul 
complete rest and he has been doing all he can to get better.

'Paul
 has only ever had to reschedule a handful of shows in his entire career
 and is so upset about this situation, he hates to let people down.'

A statement released on behalf of Sir
 Paul said: 'Since contracting a virus last week that led to the 
postponement of tour dates, Paul received successful medical treatment 
at a hospital in Tokyo.

'He
 will make a complete recovery and has been ordered to take a few daysâ€™ 
rest. Paul has been extremely moved by all the messages and well wishes 
he has received from fans all over the world.'

His wife Nancy Shevell, 53, was by his bedside.

Paul
 is due to begin a U.S. tour on 14 June, which will consist of 18 
concerts, leading to a gig at Candlestick Park stadium, the site of the 
Beatles' last public show in 1966.
