A planner was killed in front of his anguished fiancée after being hit by a bus as he crossed at a dangerous junction outside a railway station, an inquest has heard.

The accident unfolded as 26-year-old Peter Van de Bulk and his wife-to-be Lauren Barwis, both from Watford, were hurrying to catch a train from Euston station, London, in March this year.

The court heard Mr Van de Bulk tried to cross the road while the red man was showing, but lost his footing and slipped under the wheels of the number 253 bus, which was turning into the station.

But the coroner described the crossing as 'substandard' because it forces pedestrians to wait 78 seconds before crossing - a wait deemed 'unreasonable' by collision investigators.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, Coroner Dr William Dolman said: 'The figure of 78 seconds sticks in my mind. That is far too long for pedestrians hurrying to catch a train to wait.'

At the inquest at St Pancras Coroner's Court, the court heard how Mr Van de Bulk, a project planning apprentice with Transport for London, stepped into the road because he was anxious to get the train.

When he realised he had stepped into the path of the bus, he retreated back to the pavement. But his feet slipped under him, forcing his legs under the wheels of the bus.

The court heard how Mr Van de Bulk was in the driver's blind spot, meaning it would have been impossible for driver Tolu Oyenuga - who had right of way - to see him.

Giving evidence at the inquest, Ms Barwis said the pair had been returning from Great Ormond Street Hospital, where they had been visiting relatives.

The 25-year-old told the court how she watched paramedics battle for an hour to save her fiancé's life.

She described how Mr Van de Bulk - whom she was due to marry in September - made eye contact with her and opened his mouth to speak in the moments before his death.

She said: 'We were in a hurry to get to the station. I was on my phone and he was beside me, a pace away, he was muttering about train times.

'We approached the crossing in front of Euston Station and Peter was a step in front of me as we were approaching. I was on the edge of the pavement.

'He stepped onto the road and seemed to slip and fall backwards. To be honest I don't remember when the impact happened.

'I just remember him rolling under the bus and the wheels were on him. We shouted to get the bus to move forward. I had my phone in my hand, but couldn't work out how to use it. But there were lots of people around me and one of them called 999.

'He was conscious to start with. As I leant over him he made eye contact with me and he opened his mouth as if to speak, but then his eyes rolled back.' 

PC Simon Wickenden, who investigated safety at the junction, told the court there had been one injury at the crossing in the past three years but that it was 'basically uncontrolled'.

He said: 'The junction was basically uncontrolled. People had to wait 78 seconds to cross the road which is a long time, it is unreasonable to expect people to wait that long. It's not in human nature.

'Pedestrians cross the junction all the time regardless of traffic lights, unless a bus was clearly approaching. It is a substandard crossing.'  

Driver Mr Oyenuga, who has worked for Arriva for two years, said the first thing he knew about the accident was when he felt a 'thud' as his wheels rolled over the victim.

He said: 'The traffic lights were green. I was waiting in the box junction for the traffic to clear before turning right into the station.

'I had done the proper checks and was turning right, I did not see anyone. I felt a thud on the back left hand tyre and someone shouted I had run over someone.

'I was in panic when I got out of the bus. Someone shouted for me to move the bus so I got in and moved it forward.' 

The court also heard from witness Toby Jackson, who was walking behind the couple at the time of the accident and called the ambulance.

He said: 'The bus was travelling pretty slowly, about 10 mph. He stepped out into the road, saw the bus and tried to withdraw but he slipped as he stepped backwards.

'The bus came and it ran over his legs and then he was under the bus.'

A post mortem carried out by Dr Mike Sheaff ruled Mr Van de Bulk had died of multiple injuries to his legs, arms and chest. His injuries caused a cardiac arrest, as well as bleeding to the brain.

He added: 'He fell unconscious quickly, he could not have suffered and did not know what happened.'

Detective Sergeant Christopher Osborne told the court CCTV footage had shown Mr Van de Bulk had been in the driver's blindspot throughout the accident.

He said: 'There was no criminal prosecution. Mr Van de Bulk was in the driver's blind spot as he began to make the turn.

'He remained in the driver's blind spot as he stepped into the road and the driver would not have been able to see him as he slipped and fell backwards onto the ground.' 

Coroner Dr William Dolman told the inquest that measures were being taken to make the crossing safer for future pedestrians.

He said: 'This was a tragedy. He died under sad circumstances. My sympathies are with the victim and his family, and the bus driver as well. This accident was a one off.'

Speaking after the inquest, Ms Barwis, who was due to marry her fiancé on September 6th, said she was 'happy' with the result.

She said: 'I said at the time this was a tragic accident and the verdict agrees with that. I would like to make it clear we bear no grudges and do not blame the driver for his death.

'Peter was a legend. He lived life to the max. He lived far more in his short time on earth than many do in a lifetime.'
