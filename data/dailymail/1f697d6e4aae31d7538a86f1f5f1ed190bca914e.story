Repeat: Tony Martin, who killed an intruder in 1999, has been burgled again and he chased the intruder off his farm

A farmer jailed for shooting dead a burglar has told how he was too scared to tackle an intruder this week in case he was branded a criminal.

Tony Martin, 67, confronted a man stealing a tractor battery on Thursday, but felt he had to let him go.

The pensioner said he wished he had tried to stop him, but was afraid to defend his property after being locked up in 2000.

Mr Martin, who no longer holds a gun licence, said he realised ‘it would be me in trouble’. He added: ‘I couldn’t face going through all that again.’

The farmer fired three shots in 1999 after finding two burglars inside his remote Cambridgeshire home.

He killed Fred Barras, 16, and wounded his accomplice, Brendon Fearon, then 29.

Mr Martin was initially jailed for nine years after being convicted of murder, but it was reduced to manslaughter on appeal, and he was released after three years.

The case sparked fierce debate over whether homeowners should be given greater legal protection to defend their property.

Two days ago, Mr Martin caught a man breaking into a barn on his 14-acre property, but felt powerless to stop him.

He said he had already been burgled ‘two or three times’ since he was released from jail. He said: ‘I could easily have made it, and fought him for what he’d stolen, but then it quickly flashed through my mind that it would be me in trouble, not him.

‘There were weapons inside the shed so, if I had wanted to fight him off, I could have. I wished I had but, after everything I’ve been through in the past, I just couldn’t face all that hassle again.

‘I haven’t changed my views about what happened in 1999, but the whole experience has made me lose faith in the system and I didn’t want to be made out as the criminal again.’

Mr Martin, who never moved back into the farmhouse where both burglaries took place, was checking his outbuildings when he came across the intruder.

He claimed the man, in his 20s, had a £90 tractor battery and a new sink unit in his arms.

Attempt: The thief allegedly tried to steal a tractor battery before being chased away by Mr Martin

As the burglar fled – dropping the stolen items – Mr Martin said he shouted: ‘Come back again and I’ll sort you my way.’ Yesterday he vowed not to let the burglar get away for a second time.

He said: ‘He ran away but I’m convinced he’ll be back in my barn and then he’ll wish he wasn’t.’

He said little had changed to protect homeowners since his imprisonment, saying: ‘I don’t think we’re any safer than we were then.

‘I still feel vulnerable and am unable to properly protect myself.’

In October last year, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said householders who react with ‘proportionate’ force when confronted by burglars would receive more legal protection.

Last month, a law finally came into force to give householders the right to ‘bash a burglar’, but with a string of exemptions attached.

For example, people will not be protected if they chase the burglar outside – and any fight must take place indoors.

Yesterday, Mr Martin was said to be so ‘distressed’ by the attempted theft that he sought hospital treatment.

He asked officers at Wisbech Police 
Station, in Cambridgeshire, to ‘detain’ him for his own protection, 
claiming he was suffering from ‘delayed shock’.

Mr Martin, who has suffered from 
depression in recent years, was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in
King’s Lynn, Norfolk, where he was assessed by doctors.

Later he said: ‘I am here for my own sanity and the safety of burglars. I can’t stand burglars. I think they are a filthy lot.’

Mr Martin said he had suffered similar health issues in May 1999, when he had reported a string of burglaries on his farm.

He said police suggested at the time 
that the break-ins, which took place two months before he shot Barras, 
might be a ‘figment of his imagination’.

A spokesman for Norfolk Police said: ‘Inquiries are on-going.’
