Paul Ince has told under-fire Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers to sell summer signing Mario Balotelli in order to improve the struggling side's team spirit. 

Balotelli, who sealed a £16million move to Anfield in August, has failed to score a Premier League goal since joining.

Ince has questioned the 24-year-old's ability after the Italy forward failed to impress after replacing Adam Lallana at half-time during his side's 3-0 defeat by Manchester United.

Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has failed to get the best out of the £16million summer signing 

Ince, speaking to talkSPORT, said: 'I just watched him play [against Manchester United] and he plays for himself. You can see the frustration in the other players. There was a time when he could have put another player in but he didn’t.

'It seems like people are frightened to say something to him in case he goes the other way. They keep saying what a great, talented player he is but I’m yet to see it.' 

Former Liverpool midfielder Ince believes Rodgers should have steered clear of Balotelli after seeing Jose Mourinho and Roberto Mancini struggle to get the best out of him.

'It was a strange decision bringing Balotelli in,' added Ince.

'Brendan [Rodgers] thought he could take that gamble because of losing Luis Suarez to Barcelona but if Jose Mourinho couldn't control him (Balotelli) and Roberto Mancini couldn't control him then I don’t understand why Brendan thought he could.

'I think the quicker Brendan Rodgers sees it and can get rid of him the better, to be honest, and the better it will be for everyone because there is a lack of spirit in that Liverpool side.'
