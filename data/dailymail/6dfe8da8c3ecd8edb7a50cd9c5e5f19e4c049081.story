Lena Dunham has finally opened up about her unretouched Vogue photos, which were leaked by Jezebel last month after the site placed a $10,000 bounty on the original images.

The 27-year-old creator of Girls told Grantland editor Bill Simmons in a podcast released on Thursday that she was ‘kind of scared’ to see the images, but after noticing how they were minimally retouched she ‘felt completely respected by Vogue.’

‘They smoothed a line here and shaved off part of my neck,’ Miss Dunham said of the changes the magazine made to her cover shoot.

Speaking out: Lena Dunham has finally opened up about Jezebel seeking her unretouched Vogue images for a $10,000 prize, saying that it 'felt gross'

She
 elaborated, saying: ‘I felt like, “Thank you for removing the one line 
from my face because I’m 27 years old and shouldn’t have that there and I
 appreciate this.”’

Rather 
than unearth a great discrepancy between reality and distortion, as was 
Jezebel’s intention, the release of Vogue’s unretouched images actually 
drew a large backlash.

Readers
 and media outlets alike questioned the site’s famously feminist morals,
 as well as its motives for seeking out, and later releasing, the 
photos.

Miss Dunham herself called the stunt ‘messed up.’

‘I
 think Jezebel can be really smart and funny… I think it’s just like, 
once you’ve been attacked in that way, it’s hard to enjoy, once you feel
 like they’ve made such a monumental error in their approach to 
feminism. I just can’t be half-in… It felt gross,’ she explained.

At
 the time, Styleite labelled Jezebel as ‘vindictive’ for ‘handing over a
 $10,000 reward to whichever underpaid assistant in Vogue's photo 
department risks their job to cough up the photos’.

Writers
 at Crushable felt similarly, saying that the site’s move was ‘so far 
from okay (delete extra unneeded sentence) ... there’s nothing wrong 
with wanting to look better than your best when you’re doing a Vogue 
photo shoot. In the same way there’s nothing wrong with Lena Dunham 
getting decked out at award shows.’

Proud of her form: Miss Dunham has never been one to shy away from displaying her body, and often appears in various states of undress on her HBO TV show

Website SheKnows also wrote a story with the headline, ‘Lena Dunham's Vogue cover: Was the photo editing that bad?’

An
 outpouring of Twitter response even saw Jezebel users attest that they 
were boycotting the site in protest of its hunt for Miss Dunham’s 
photos.

Miss Dunham, 
herself, does not feel all that dissimilar: ‘Instead of going, “Hey we 
kind of f***** up, these photos are not that retouched. Lena go enjoy 
the Vogue spread that you’ve been excited about since you were eight 
years old,” they were like, “She is not retouched, but she could have 
been.”’

The young actress 
and director says that she felt the site’s handing of the photos ‘was 
this weird political maneuvering that I had a lot of trouble 
respecting.’

The photos in 
question were featured in Vogue’s February issue – one which is already 
being switched out at newsstands for the magazine’s March issue staring 
Rihanna.
