A UKIP county councillor and his wife have admitted stealing nearly £25,000 through benefit fraud using a false address for two years.

Cllr Peter Lagoda, 59, and his wife Maria, also 59, today dramatically changed their plea to guilty at the start of their trial.

The pair had been accused of giving Fenland District Council a false address in a bid to claim extra benefits from 2008 to 2010.

Confession: Cllr Peter Lagoda and his wife Maria both pleaded guilty to using a false address for two years

Lagoda had claimed he lived in South Beach, Cambridgeshire, when instead he shared a property in nearby Wisbech with his wife.

It had been alleged the councillor and his wife falsely claimed £11,565 in income support, £2,346 in council tax and £10,949 in housing benefit.

Despite originally pleading not guilty in April last year at Cambridge Magistrates' Court, the pair have now admitted all the charges against them.

Peterborough Crown Court heard how the dishonesty had stretched for more than two years between June 2008 and November 2010.

A UKIP spokesman said: 'If he has 
pleaded guilty to a criminal offence, the party will revoke his 
membership. He is currently suspended from the party and sitting as an 
Independent.'

Sentence: The couple will be sentenced together on March 28 at Peterborough Crown Court

The confession comes after Lagoda admitted he described his north African sister as a 'w*g' and German relatives as 'Mongols' whose children have 'slanty eyes'.

He said: 'Yes, my cousin married Mongols and now all their little children are ever so cute and they have slanty eyes.'

Lagoda had been elected to represent Wisbech South on Cambridgeshire County Council in May last year.

But he was suspended from UKIP after being charged by Cambridgeshire Constabulary with the fraud.

The pair will now be sentenced on March 28 at the same court.
