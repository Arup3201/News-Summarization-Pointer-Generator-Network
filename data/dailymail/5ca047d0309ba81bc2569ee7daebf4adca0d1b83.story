The White House refused on Thursday to publicly incriminate North Korea in a cyber hack on computers at Sony Pictures, even though senior U.S. officials have already indicated in private that the country was 'centrally involved.'

The president's spokesman instead claimed that the 'destructive activity with malicious intent' was carried out 'by a sophisticated actor.'

'I am not in a position to confirm any attribution at this point,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. 

He promised that the Obama administration was taking the matter 'seriously,' however, and that investigators are 'mindful of the fact that we need a proportional response.' He also revealed that retaliatory actions may be kept secret.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Thursday that President Barack Obama considers the recent Sony hacking 'a serious national security matter' and that it is still under investigation. He would not implicate North Korea in the attack, though senior administration officials have already told the press that they know the country was 'centrally involved'

The New York Times had reported earlier in the day that senior administration officials had acknowledged to the news publication that North Korea was behind the breach of Sony computers that wiped data and exposed employees' personal information, including their emails.

The matter escalated to a national security issue after hackers sent news organizations a message warning of terrorist-style attacks on movie theaters that showed Seth Rogen and James Franco's forthcoming film The Interview.

'Remember the 11th of September 2001,' the message said. 'We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time.'

The cyber terrorists specifically threatened 'the very times and places' the Interview was to be shown.

The Interview features Franco and Rogen as journalists who are recruited by the CIA to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The film was set for release in the U.S. on Dec. 25, but several major theater chains said this week they would not show the movie in light of the menacing messages.

On Wednesday Sony cancelled the theatrical release of the film entirely, citing the 'decision by the majority of our exhibitors not to show the film.'

'We respect and understand our partners' decision and, of course, completely share their paramount interest in the safety of employees and theater-goers,' it said in a statement.

North Korea has said it is not responsible for the cyber attack, despite promising 'merciless counter-measures' this summer if the United States government allowed the film to be released.

In its denial it also 'called upon the world to turn out in the just struggle to put an end to U.S. imperialism, the chieftain of aggression and the worst human rights abuser' and stated that the U.S. should 'know that there are a great number of supporters and sympathizers with the [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] all over the world.'

The state-run Korean Central News Agency also claimed, 'The righteous reaction will get stronger to smash the evil doings.'

Describing the attacks a 'serious national security matter,' the White House said on Thursday that the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice were taking the investigation into matter 'as seriously as you would expect.'

The terrorist threat has been the topic of 'daily' meetings at the White House, press secretary Earnest said, led by the president's homeland security adviser and cyber coordinator and include senior members of intelligence community, Homeland Security Department, the military and of the law enforcement and diplomatic communities.

As the discussions continue, the president's national security team is 'considering a range of options,' Earnest said.

'Destructive activity merits an appropriate response,' he said and one that is 'not always obvious, but is something that is worthy of careful consideration.

'And that's exactly what the president's national security team is doing,' he explained.

At the same time, the Obama administration is keenly aware that 'oftentimes' perpetrators of these types of attacks are 'seeking to provoke a response from United States of America,' he said.

'They may believe that a response from the United States in one fashion or another would be advantageous to them.'

He later clarified that in the White House's view, 'It's not hard to imagine that there may be some organizations or individuals who would perceive a specific response from the United States as something that might enhance their standing either among their cohorts of colleagues or even on the international stage.'

The Obama administration official said he could not provide any details 'at this point' on the actions the federal government may engage in and cautioned that they will likely include 'the kinds of things that we wouldn't want to telegraph in advance.'

And Earnest said he may not ever be able to share that information.

'I also wouldn't commit...to at some point being entirely transparent...about what that response is,' he warned reporters.

On Wednesday the president also promised that his administration believe the cyberattack to be 'very serious.'

'We're investigating it. We're taking it seriously. You know, we'll be vigilant. If we see something that we think is serious and credible, then we'll alert the public,' he said in an interview with ABC News.

'But for now, my recommendation would be that people go to the movies,' he added.
