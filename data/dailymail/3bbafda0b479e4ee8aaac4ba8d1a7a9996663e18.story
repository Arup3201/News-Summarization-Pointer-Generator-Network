Returning home from a month away, most people look forward to walking in to a quiet, peaceful atmosphere.

But that wasn't the case for one unsuspecting actor - who came back to find his room filled with more than 2,000 balloons.

Jamie Muscato and Joe Mott, from London, spent 30 days and a 'ridiculous amount of money' carrying out the hilarious prank on their housemate, Richard Southgate.

They blew up 2,300 balloons and packed them in the room of their friend, who had been away for a month with work.

They then waited for Richard to return home, before capturing his priceless reaction on video.

The
 short film was later posted on YouTube , prompting Jamie 
to joke on Twitter: 'Well that balloon video blew up.'

Footage
 shows Jamie explaining on the day of prank: 'Our housemate Rich has 
been away for about a month now. We decided to prank him by filling his 
room up with balloons... over 2,000 balloons.' 

Unsuspecting: The pranksters film Richard as he arrives home and walks to his bedroom door (pictured)

Shocked: Seconds later, Richard is captured opening his door, before staring open-mouthed at the balloons

Beside himself: He then starts laughing while his friends urge him to 'go in' and enjoy the 2,300 inflatables

Reaction: Richard, who had been away for a month with work, was stunned when he walked into his room

Joe adds: 'Today is judgement day.'

The pair can then be seen welcoming Richard home with hearty hugs, before filming him as he walks to his bedroom door.

At this point, Richard seems to suspect something is amiss, asking his friends: 'What have you done?'

However, in keeping with the prank, Jamie and Joe both reply: 'We haven't done anything.'

He
 then starts laughing while his friends urge him to 'go in' and enjoy 
the brightly-coloured inflatables, which are almost touching the 
ceiling.

The trio are then filmed bouncing around his room in delight, with Richard saying: 'There are balloons everywhere! It's ridiculous!'

He later jokes that he will have to sleep on the ceiling, adding: 'I'll just lounge in this balloon cloud.'

Having a gass: Joe poses with more than 2,000 balloons following the hilarious prank on his friend, Richard

Incredible: This shot shows the thousands of inflatables used in the prank, which almost touched the ceiling

Despite the prank's success, the trio seemed to finally accept that a room with balloons was not practical in the long-run.

Shortly after uploading the video, they posted a photo of a balloon-popping instrument they had created, comprising of a long wooden stick and seven sharp nails.

Then, all they were left with was the enormous task of popping the 2,000-plus balloons...
