Doctors at one English hospital have dealt with 1,500 cases of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) in just five years, it emerged today.

Figures from Birmingham's Heartlands Hospital reveal that staff see six patients who have been subjected to the barbaric procedure every week.

Nationwide, 15 new cases of FGM are reported to hospital around the country every day. But the victims of the shocking practice are clustered in certain areas, which explains the high rate in Birmingham.

Birmingham's Heartlands hospital says it is dealing with six cases of Female Genital Mutilation every week

Heartlands saw 349 cases in 2013, following 288 cases in 2012, 316 in 2011 and 317 in 2010.

It is thought to be one of the centres which has seen a large number of the 463 cases now being identified in England every month.

NSPCC Head of Child Protection Operations John Cameron said: 'These figures show the NHS is consistently seeing a high number of FGM cases every month.

'FGM is a live public health issue and it is vital all health professionals are trained to spot the signs of FGM and that girls who are subjected to this brutal practice get the post-traumatic support they deserve.

'We need to ensure doctors, midwives and other healthcare professionals are working effectively together with children's services to support and protect FGM victims and their family members.'

Campaigners have pointed out that the numbers may be just the tip of the iceberg, as only those women who have sought specific medical treatment are included in the data.

It is believed the vast majority of cases are women who were born abroad and then moved to the UK in childhood or later life.

Victims are often identified when they come in to have infections and other conditions linked to the procedure treated, while others are noted when they attend for pre-natal checks.

Female genital mutilation (FGM) is the deliberate removal of all or part of the external female genitalia.

The World Health Organisation describes FGM as any procedure that injures the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. It is also referred to as female circumcision or female cutting.

FGM is mostly carried out on young girls in adolescence but is also carried out during childhood and sometimes on babies.

In some cultures, it is seen as a right of passage into womanhood and a condition of marriage. Some believe the genitals will be 'unclean' if the female does not have FGM.

There is also a common belief that women need to have FGM to have babies. But, infact, FGM can cause infertility and an increased risk of childbirth complications.

The procedure is often carried out by a woman with no medical training.

Anaesthetics and antiseptic treatments are not generally used and the practice is usually carried out using knives, scissors, scalpels, pieces of glass or razor blades.

The procedure can cause severe bleeding and infections, which can last the woman's entire lifetime.

It is estimated that 3 million girls are cut every year across the world. Around 23,000 of these are carried out in the UK. The practice is particularly rife in some African, Middle Eastern and Asian countries.

FGM has been illegal in the UK since 1984 and since 2003 anyone taking a child out of the UK for the practice faces 14 years in prison.

Despite the rise in hospital cases and an increase in reports to police in 2014 there has not been a single conviction in the UK.

Research by the charity Equality Now and City University last year estimated more than 100,000 women have migrated to England and Wales after suffering FGM - up more than 50% since 2001.

The Birmingham hospital's figures were released after the Muslim Women's Network told the West Midlands Police and Crime Panel that the levels current support and counselling for victims - many of whom suffer flashbacks - are not good enough.

The charity said the latest case it uncovered was just last week and involved a young Yemeni girl from an unnamed Birmingham school.

Shaita Gohir MBE, who is chair of the charity, told the panel: 'We need to get funding for specific counselling in this area.'

Birmingham is one of the most ethnically diverse cities in Britain. In the 2011 census, more than 280,000 residents - 26% of the city's population - gave their ethnicity as Asian or Asian-British, 93,000 said they consider themselves Black or Black-British and 10,900 listed themselves as Arab.

Earlier this month, Britain's top family judge, Sir James Munby called on local councils to do more to battle what he called 'the great evil' of FGM.

He said: 'Plainly, given the nature of the evil, prevention is infinitely better than cure.

'Local authorities need to be pro-active and vigilant in taking appropriate protective measures to prevent girls being subjected to FGM.

'The court must not hesitate to use every weapon in its protective arsenal if faced with a case of actual or anticipated FGM.'
