Bizarre claims: Hal Adonis hugs Mikaela Mayer after her fight during the U.S. women's boxing Olympic trials in Febuary. Months later he said women boxers were either gay or molested as children

American amateur boxing has been flung into turmoil after the former chief of the sport said all female fighters had to be either child abuse victims or gay.

In an interview with The New Yorker magazine over the summer, Hal Adonis, then president of Boxing USA, declared that being abused in early life provides the perfect 
foundations for a successful boxing career.

During the rant, he made a series of extraordinary claims about women's amateur boxing, including the words: 'Half of our girls have been molested, half of our girls are gay.'

He also told the magazine: 'When kids call me up, I say: "Let me ask you an honest question: have 
your parents ever hit you?" If they say no, I say: "I don't think you 
belong in boxing."'

The comments sent shockwaves around the American boxing community forcing the International Boxing Association (AIBA) to step in to demand his immediate dismissal.

But while Boxing USA summarily sacked him as its president, a post he held since 2009, it refused the AIBA's request to remove him from its board of members.

So in a decisive act of retribution on Wednesday, the AIBA suspended Boxing USA completely forcing the cancellation of all competitions and temporarily revoking the licences of amateur boxing gyms across the country.

In a statement it branded his words 'defamatory to the reputation of AIBA, the sport of boxing, women's 
boxing in particular, certain minority groups, and inappropriately 
associating child abuse with the sport of boxing'.

But today, the body made an unexpected U-turn and reinstated Boxing USA, stating: 'The athletes across the country were the biggest victims of this 
suspension and we wanted to ensure that the mistakes of the 
organization's past leadership have as little impact on them as 
possible.'

The two-year suspension from all amateur boxing activities AIBA placed on Adonis, however, remains in effect.

But his comments have continued to 
reverberate across the world of amateur boxing since he made them in 
June, weeks before the Olympic Games were due to be held in London.

He told the magazine's reporter that being his father 'invented child abuse' and used to beat him around the face with his belt.

'When I got on to the streets and got into boxing, I was so used to getting hit it was like, "hey, this is nothing!"' he said.

When he trained young boxers, he said: 'Before a fight I'd start 
smacking them real hard in the face. Because you feel, in boxing, the 
first couple punches. After that, the endorphins kick in and it's like 
someone gave you Novocain.'
