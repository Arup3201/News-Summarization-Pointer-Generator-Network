Jack Collison played 90 minutes as QPR were held to a frustrating goalless draw at Roots Hall on Wednesday.

The former West Ham midfielder is on trial with the Premier League new-boys after leaving Upton Park at the end of the season.

And the Welsh international, who has been troubled by a knee injury over the years, came through the game unscathed as he tries to prove his fitness to Hoops boss Harry Redknapp.

However, the weakened west Londoners, who
 left stars Rio Ferdinand, Steven Caulker and Joey Barton at home, 
failed to find a way past the League Two side.

Yun Suk-Young returned to the side following his involvement in the World Cup with South Korea, while Clint Hill, Nedum Onuoha, Alejandro Faurlin and Matt Phillips also featured.

Rangers keeper Brian Murphy was forced into a save by Barry Corr, while midfielder Conor Clifford clipped the crossbar.

With no Charlie Austin, Bobby Zamora and Loic Remy, Redknapp was forced to deploy Phillips as an emergency striker.

However, the closest the visitors came was a second-half header from youngster Frankie Sutherland.
