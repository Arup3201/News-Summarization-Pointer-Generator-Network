Supermarket chain Asda has apologised to an expecting mother who it slapped with a parking ticket for ‘wrongly’ using a parent and child bay while nine months pregnant.  

Asma Mohiuddin was hit with the £70 ticket just nine days before she was due.

She parked in the mother and toddler bay close to the doors of a busy supermarket, because she was struggling to walk. 

Asma, 33, and husband Nadeem Mohiuddin were horrified when they returned to their car to find the ticket at the Beckton branch in East London.

The pair tried to appeal the decision, but they were turned down and almost forced to stump up the cash before a last-minute reprieve from Asda cancelled the ticket.

The pair, from Manor Park, east London, welcomed their third child Aiza into the world just 14 days after the February 23 incident.

Angry Nadeem, a local authority community warden, said: “I was unaware that a woman who is nine months pregnant could be deemed not to be accompanied by a child.

“Considering it’s a free car park, this is crazy - we were quite clearly within our rights to use that space.

“This is a moral outrage and an infringement of my wife’s human rights.”

Stay-at-home mum Asma said: “It’s mind-boggling that we would get this ticket.

An Asda Spokesman apologised to Mr and Mrs Mohiuddin for any inconvenience caused saying the supermarket hoped to speak to them very soon to resolve this matter

“I was quite clearly carrying a child with me - whether she was under my arm or in my womb, it’s not up to Asda to make an arbitrary distinction.”

The pair have two older children, seven-year-old Alayna and three-year-old Haiqa.

He added: “It has always been a moral courtesy and tradition in our nation to make exceptions for expectant mothers.

“On public transport designated seats are provided for the disabled, expectant mothers, and parents with children - there was never a distinction between the three.

“Supermarkets and retail parks are using technicalities to target expectant mothers who are just shopping - it’s expensive enough getting ready to bring a child into the world without first getting stung with unnecessary and petty charges.

“I strongly believe this is a national disgrace.”

An Asda Spokesman said: “We would like to apologise to Mr and Mrs Mohiuddin for any inconvenience caused and we hope to speak to them very soon to resolve this matter."
