He might no longer have LeBron James around, but Dwyane Wade has found a new partner-in-crime.

The Miami Heat star larked about with a dolphin at San Diego's Sea World on a visit with his family. Wade exchanged passes with the sea critter and posted the results on his Instagram account.

The Heat guard has confirmed that, unlike Cleveland Cavaliers-returning James, he will be staying with Miami.

'Dwyane has been the franchise cornerstone for this team since the day he arrived 11 years ago,' Heat president Pat Riley said.

'He has shown his commitment to the Heat many times over the course of his career and has always been willing to sacrifice in order to help build this team into a champion. This time is no different.

'I am ecstatic to have him back in the fold and I am confident that Dwyane, as always, will be leading this team as we look to contend for NBA championships.'
