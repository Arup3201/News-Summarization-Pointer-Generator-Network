A mother-of-three who was denied entry to a bar because she was too fat and once got stuck in a football stadium turnstile was finally convinced to lose weight after breaking a church pew by sitting on it.

Tipping the scales at  26st 13lbs, Karen Dawson, 40, from Rhondda, south Wales, was morbidly obese and a dress size 38 when she attended her mother-in-law's funeral in 2011.

The customer services adviser was left mortified when the wooden church pew split underneath her bulk as she sat down for the service.

Karen Dawson, 40, from Rhondda, Wales, was left mortified when the wooden pew she was sitting on at her mother-in-law's funeral snapped. Karen dieted and dropped from 26st 13lbs (left) to 18st 1lb (right)

She vowed to change her eating patterns and, by swapping greasy takeaways for salads and lean meat, lost 8st 12lbs in just two years.

Karen said: 'It was one of the most embarrassing moments of my life. As soon as the bench cracked underneath me, I knew my weight was a problem.

'After dieting, I now feel so much more confident about myself and I'm no longer terrified of breaking any chairs I sit on.

'My funeral shame was excruciating but it was the kick start I needed to lose weight.'

Karen began struggling with weight gain after moving out of her parents' house shortly after she turned 18.

Away from the watchful eye of her health-conscious mother, she was able to munch on sweets, crisps and other fatty snacks.

As an adult, she liked nothing better than spending a sedentary evening in with her husband Warren, 48, a British Airways worker.

After giving birth to three children MacKenzie, seven, Jaxon, three and Dexter, two, Karen weighed nearly 27 stone.

The mother-of-three decided to join her local Slimming World group Llantwit Fardre in Church Village and, for the first time in her adult life, started paying close attention to what she ate

However, she continued to eat whatever she wanted, despite regularly being put in embarrassing situations because of her size.

She said: 'I tried to get into a local bar when I was overweight, and man on the door told me I couldn't come in because of my size. 

'He simply said I was too fat.

'I was so shocked I just walked away. I didn't know what to say.

'I went to a football match with my husband once, and I was too big to go through the turnstile. 

'Warren had to literally push me through the gap.'

Karen also broke numerous office chairs due to her large frame.

She said: 'Whenever I was out for dinner I had to ask for the restaurant not to seat me in a booth as I would squeeze into the space.

'If my husband and I went for a coffee, I always had to look through the window to check that they didn't have fixed seats.

'Clothes were a problem too, one time I applied for a job at a supermarket and they told me not to bother having an interview as they would never find a uniform which fitted me.'

The final straw came in 2011, though, while attending the funeral of her mother-in-law Lynne. 

Karen sat on a church pew only to have it split beneath her.

She said: 'I sat down and my bulk split the entire wooden pew. I was mortified.

'I didn't break enough so that everyone fell off, but I was terrified that it would completely give way during the funeral.

'As we watched the coffin being lowered, I wanted the ground to swallow me up. 

'As soon as the funeral ended I got out of there as quick as I could - I was really ashamed.'

Karen has managed to shed more than eight stone and has dropped eight dress sizes to now weigh 18st 1lb

The mother-of-three decided to join her local Slimming World group Llantwit Fardre in Church Village and, for the first time, started paying close attention to what she ate.

Before her dramatic weight loss, Karen would eat nothing for breakfast, have an egg mayonnaise sandwich with crisps and sweets for lunch and an Indian takeaway for dinner consisting of a chicken korma, rice, chips and onion bhajis.

Throughout the day she would snack on sweets, chocolate, biscuits and crisps.

Karen has swapped fatty takeaways for lean meat

Today, she eats Slimming World scan bran for breakfast, homemade vegetable soup for lunch and a chilli con carne made with extra-lean mince served with potatoes cooked in low-fat frying oven.

She has since managed to shed more than eight stone and has dropped down eight dress sizes.

She now weighs 18st 1lb.

She said: 'I still want to lose a lot more, but this last year has made a huge difference to my life.

She said: 'I used to eat what I wanted, whenever I wanted it, and I ate until I was really big. I thought nothing of what I was doing to my body - I was perfectly happy.

'Wherever I went I could see people staring at me and nudging each other.

'I would shrug it off though, I was always the fat jolly one and I used to make fun of myself - but I wasn't happy.'

'Now I can get down on the floor and play with my kids, I also feel confident enough to take them out at weekends. 

'I was able to go to my son's nativity play, I was too embarrassed to go last year but I was on the front row this year.

'People used to stare at me because of my size, now no one bats an eyelid.'
