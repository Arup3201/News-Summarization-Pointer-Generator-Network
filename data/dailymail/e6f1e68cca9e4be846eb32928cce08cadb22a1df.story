A five-year-old boy who was born with his bowel attached to his heart has already faced eight life-saving operations -and he has more to come.

John-Joseph Lively, of Wallsend in North Tyneside almost died in his father's arms after contracting meningitis.

He has endured multiple procedures on his heart and bowel and became the one of the first children in the country to have a pioneering surgery to flush out his bowel. 

Now the inspiring five-year-old has been nominated for a bravery award, in recognition of his fight to survive.

John, 50 and Angela Lively, 42 (now separated) have been told their son John-Joseph, 5, faces more surgery despite having already undergone eight operations since birth

Father John Lively, 40, said his son's courage is infectious.

He said: 'My little boy is my inspiration. I don't know anyone whose been through so much and come out smiling.'

After he was born, doctors became worried about John Joseph as tests revealed his bowel was attached to his heart.

Mr Lively said they were given difficult news about their newborn son straight away.

He said: 'They also said he had a hole in his heart and that the valves were collapsing.

'We were told pretty much straight away that he was going to need open heart surgery.'

At just nine-months-old, John-Joseph underwent the operation at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital.

Straight after surgery he contract pneumonia and spent the next two weeks in intensive care.

Operation after operation followed, not only to help repair his heart, but also his damaged bowel.

John-Joseph also became one of the youngest children in the country to undergo an Antegrade Colonic Enema (ACE) procedure to help with his bowel condition.

A small opening was made in his lower tummy, and a saline solution flushed in to wash out his colon and produce a bowel movement.

But contracting meningitis meant he almost lost his life.

Mr Lively said: 'He was so poorly, he contracted meningitis and almost died in my arms three different times.' 

Antegrade colonic enema, or antegrade continence enema (ACE) is a surgical procedure designed to make enemas easier and more convenient.

The surgeon uses the appendix to create a channel between the bowel and the abdomen.

An artificial opening called a stoma is then made in the surface of the abdomen. 

A catheter can be inserted into the stoma so that liquids can be passed into the bowel to wash out its contents through the anus.

Today Mr Lively and his former wife Angela, 42, of South Shields, have been told their son faces the prospect of more heart surgery.

But that is not stopping John-Joseph enjoying sports and activities.

'He's such a happy little chap,' added Mr Lively. 

'He loves football, computer games and Lego.

'Don't get me wrong, we have our hard days but every time I see him laughing, it touches my heart and I think what an incredible inspiration he is.'

John-Joseph has now been nominated for a Champion Child of Courage award by his local paper.

Recently he also starred in a video for the Royal Victoria Infirmary to help other parents and children who are going through the ACE procedure.

Mr Lively said he is truly inspired by his son's continuing optimism.

He added: 'To me, my son is a hero. I can't count the number of times I have seen him come out of surgery, open his eyes, sit up and smile.'
