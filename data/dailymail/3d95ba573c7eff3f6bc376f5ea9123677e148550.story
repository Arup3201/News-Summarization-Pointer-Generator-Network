Paedophile Michael McAuliffe who was spotted by an off-duty police officer while on the run in London. He has had his sentencing adjourned

A convicted paedophile had his sentencing adjourned today after he claimed to have information on the child abuse allegedly being covered up in Westminster in the 1970s.

A court heard Michael McAuliffe is also able to provide information about further child abuse and paedophile rings.

James Bourne-Arton QC, defending McAuliffe, asked the court whether his client's case could be adjourned for police investigations into his claims to be made.

Mr Bourne-Arton told Bradford Crown Court, West Yorkshire,  his client 'has information to the abuse covered up in the 1970s in Westminster'.

'He also said there was other evidence of child abuse and paedophile rings he was able to give information of,' he added.

McAuliffe was in court to be sentenced for a string of child porn image charges after an off-duty copper spotted him in London - where he had tried to escape justice by changing his name.

The 50-year-old, who changed his name to Ashley Peters, was registered with West Yorkshire Police and legally bound to notify the force of any change in address following child porn convictions.

Detective Sergeant Linda Christie spotted McAuliffe handing out leaflets in the West End during an evening stroll.

It led to his home being searched and the discovery of thousands of pornographic images and videos of children, some at the highest level of seriousness.

Last month McAuliffe, of Haworth, West Yorkshire, pleaded guilty by video link to 23 offences, including failing to comply with the sex offenders' register by changing his name and address last November.

Also included were 17 further charges of making thousands of indecent photos and movies of children, and four of distributing indecent photos of children.

Michael Smith, prosecuting, told the court their position 'is one of deep scepticism' regarding McAuliffe's recent claims.

He said McAuliffe had earlier given evidence that he was looking at the indecent images to detect crime.

McAuliffe's barrister said his client 'has information about the abuse covered up in the 1970s in Westminster' and called for the sentencing to be adjourned while he speaks to the police

Mr Smith added that the paedophile has always been 'deeply hostile towards the police' and has said 'the only good copper is a dead copper'.

Mr Smith added that the police say it is highly unlikely they would make a deal with the defendant, but they would be willing to speak with him, either before or after his sentencing.

Judge Peter Benson spoke briefly to the defendant to inform him of the new date for his sentencing and told him he would remain in custody.

McAuliffe then said, 'Can I just say the names I've got...' before Judge Benson cut him off and sent him down to the cells.

He will be sentenced in six weeks' time at Bradford Crown Court.
