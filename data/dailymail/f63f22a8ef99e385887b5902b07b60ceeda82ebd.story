A scandal over pornographic emails being shared by employees at the attorney general's office spilled over to another department when it was revealed some porn emails were sent from a State Supreme Court Justice.

The Allentown Morning Call reviewed 54 emails sent from Justice Seamus McCaffery's personal Comcast email address to an employee at the State Attorney General's Office and found at least 8 contained pornographic images and videos.

The revelation that McCaffery sent pornography-laced email chains comes as Governor Tom Corbett is facing scrutiny for pornography being forwarded within the state's attorney general's office during his tenure there.

Forward: Pornographic emails sent from the private account of State Supreme Court Justice Seamus McCaffery have increased attention on the governor and high-level staff

The emails at the State Attorney General's Office turned up during an internal review of the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal by now-attorney general Kathleen Kane.

A staffer under Corbett during his tenure as attorney general, from 2005 to 2011, requested his past emails at Kane's request, when a routine screening uncovered some questionable content.

Subject lines like 'Devotion' and 'Courage' topped emails containing pornographic images of women loosely playing on that theme. There were also sex tapes and off-color but otherwise harmless jokes.

After news of the emails came to Kane, both Corbett and State Supreme Court Chief Justice Ronald Castille asked for copies of the chains to determine whether members of their departments were involved.

Members of the media also submitted Right-to-Know requests, and late in September, Kane shared emails from the inboxes of eight former staffers at the attorney general's office. 

All eight men worked under Corbett during his tenure as attorney general, with some following him into his administration.

Investigation: Current State Attorney General Kathleen Kane has led an investigation into the prosecution of Jerry Sandusky that turned up pornographic emails in inboxes of Corbett's staff, leading some to accuse Kane and other Democrats of settling political scores 

Two of the owners of those inboxes, Christopher Abruzzo, Environmental Protection Secretary under Corbett, and Glenn Parno, a lawyer with the Department of Environmental Protection, have resigned.

McCaffery's emails were revealed Wednesday by Morning Call as coming from the batch shown by Kane.

The justice forwarded emails with titles like 'tan lines XXX' depicting nude centerfolds, though only eight messages were found with lewd content.

Two more had off-color jokes but others were filled with mundane pet advice or political jokes about presidents Obama and Reagan.

These messages were forwarded to a member of Corbett's attorney general's office, then sent on to a circle of former members of Philadelphia police, where McCaffery served for 20 years before becoming a judge in 1993.

Justice McCaffery has so far declined to speak about the emails.

Penn Live reports that if the emails were stored by members of the Attorney General's Office, it would be in violation of the office's police of 'appropriate use of computer resources.'
