Mr Deans resigned from his role as Unite boss at the Grangemouth refinery on Monday

Police are investigating fresh evidence suggesting that Unite conspired to rig a Labour party candidate selection.

Officers in Scotland have revealed they are studying emails which suggest that Unite and its official Stephen Deans were instrumental in thwarting the Labour Party’s probe of the union’s influence in Falkirk.

Mr Deans resigned from his role as Unite boss at the Grangemouth refinery on Monday.

The news came as David Cameron launched an outspoken assault on Ed Miliband for failing to re-open Labour’s internal inquiry.

The Prime Minister branded the Labour leader ‘weak’ for failing to discipline Mr Deans, who remains chairman of the Falkirk West constituency party, which has been taken into ‘special measures’ by the Labour leadership.

In heated exchanges at Prime Minister’s Question Time, Mr Cameron said: ‘We need to have a proper inquiry into what happened in Unite, a proper inquiry into what happened in Grangemouth, because we all know the leader of the Labour Party is too weak to do it himself.’

Gesturing at Mr Miliband, Mr Cameron added: ‘If they had any courage, any vision, any strength of decision-making, they’d recognise they need to have that inquiry and get to the bottom of what happened.’

The scandal erupted when four members of the Kane family in Falkirk complained that they had been signed up as Labour members without them knowing.

At that time Mr Deans was trying to get Karie Murphy – a close friend of Unite boss Len McCluskey – selected as the Labour candidate.

Labour held an internal investigation but Unite were cleared of wrongdoing in September when the Kanes retracted their evidence. A separate police investigation was also dropped.

Emails printed by the Sunday Times suggest that Unite officials were instrumental in ensuring the evidence was withdrawn.

In one message, dated July 30, Unite executive Howard Beckett said Mr Deans would arrange for the retractions to be signed by the Kane family. Mr Deans is related to one member of the family.

In a separate email sent on the same day, Mr Deans said he was ‘happy’ with the statements drawn up by Unite ‘and can get this to the Kane family and get it posted tonight’.

Tory MP Henry Smith urged Scottish police to reopen its investigation of Unite’s activities.

Yesterday he said: ‘Police Scotland have confirmed to me they are investigating Unite’s Labour parliamentary seat-fixing allegations in Falkirk again.’

In a letter to Mr Smith on behalf of Police Scotland’s Chief Constable Sir Stephen House, officers revealed that his inquiry has been ‘passed’ to Assistant Chief Constable Ruaraidh Nicolson, ‘who investigated the initial report, for review’.

An announcement on whether to formally re-launch the criminal investigation will be made ‘in due course’, the letter says.

A Labour source said: ‘We think it is a wise course of action to let the police finish their process and we will consider the position after that.’
