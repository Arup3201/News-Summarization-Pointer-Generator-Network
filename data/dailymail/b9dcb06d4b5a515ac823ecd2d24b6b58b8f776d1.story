As they stepped off the stage at San Francisco's AT&T Park, the billion dollar couple were not ushered away in separate cars or separate hotels - after reports claimed that things were so bad between them that they couldn't even stand to sleep in the same building.

Instead they joined pals including Black Eyed Peas star Will.i.am at the city's Tosca Cafe - before returning together to the Presidential Suite at the St Regis hotel at 2am.

The suite has its own private entrance via elevator in an underground car park and a source at the hotel confirmed: 'Jay Z and Beyoncé are staying here together in the Presidential Suite.

'They
 chose this room because they have their own way in and out without 
anybody seeing them.'

Instead,
 after leaving the concert venue, they made their way back to the hotel,
 and after changing, were seen sitting next to each other as they were 
driven to dinner.

Arriving
 at the tiny Italian restaurant, somewhat of a San Francisco 
institution, they walked through the main door and straight through to 
their private dining room, where they were joined by five friends.

But music's own royal couple left their own party early, sneaking out of a back door just after 2am which is just 
yards away from the entrance to a strip joint.

Others continued eating and drinking as will.i.am was the last man standing out of the front door at 4am.

A witness inside the restaurant told MailOnline: 'It was something you could never imagine seeing when Jay and Bey walked in.

'Beyoncé smiled at anyone who she made eye contact with and appeared to be at total ease despite what everyone has heard.'

However, it seemed that recent events had shaken rapper Jay Z, as the onlooker said: 'He did look uncomfortable and had the look of someone who was trying to 
keep a low profile, like he didn't want to put a toe out of line.

'I'm not sure what happened because they left really abruptly while their 
friends were still happily chatting away and enjoying themselves.'

 returned to the St. Regis, and will stay there again tonight as they 
play their final US date for their joint On The Run tour, which is said

Amid rumors that the couple have been preparing to separate after their tour ends in Paris next month, Jay Z mysteriously cut lyrics from his iconic hit Big Pimpin' during Tuesday night's show, proving he may be doing his best to keep his wife.

In the second line of the song he usually raps 'Cause I don't f****** need 'em' in reference to women, hinting he's too afraid to even consider a future without his wife.

As sources have told MailOnline, the 44-year-old megastar is desperate to take his wife away for duration of the five-week break they have between tonight's last show in San Francisco - and two final dates in Paris on September 12 and 13.

It would be a salve to any issues the pair have been having, as the New York Post reported
 things had becomes so tense they had been staying in separate hotels 
rooms while on tour - and claimed that Beyonce had launched a hunt for her own Manhattan home.

While Radar Online reported that Beyonce has also taken 
comfort from close friend Gwyneth Paltrow, staying at the Oscar winner's LA home over the weekend.

Make or break: Jay Z and Beyonce will tonight stay at the St. Regis as they come to the end of their US tour. Sources say Jay Z then wants to whisk Beyonce away to repair any damage to their marriage

Indeed,
 their relationship was said to be in so much trouble that the Post reported that bigwigs from 
HBO - who are filming the show - concert promoters Live Nation and 
lawyers were called into a crisis meeting last Thursday - prompting 
fears the pair could pull out of their Paris dates.

Execs
 allegedly wished to release a statement, which Beyoncé and Jay-Z are 
said to have opposed, disagreeing upon what it should say.

‘There
 are lawyers that have now joined the tour, and they’re not here just to
 see them perform. They are here to help hash things out,’ a source told the Post.

Live
 Nation CEO Michael Rapino and HBO chief Richard Plepler reportedly called for the 
meeting before ‘this becomes a public-relations nightmare,’ the insider 
added.

 MailOnline the network will shoot the dates in France and air the 
concert on September 20.

for her, but Beyoncé isn't sure what she wants to do - their marriage is
 in flux, that's the truth. Jay just wants them to spend some time alone
 together to try and work it out.
