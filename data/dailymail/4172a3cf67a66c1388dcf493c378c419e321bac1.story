The tradesman named as a person of interest in the case of missing toddler William Tyrell has recently had three children in his care removed from his home.

It has been revealed that Bill Spedding and his wife Margaret were questioned about their treatment of children by the NSW Family and Community Services department only a few days before the washing machine repairer's property was searched for two days last week by police. 

However, detectives were unaware of the FACS questioning, which resulted in three young people being taken from the home, The Daily Telegraph reported.

As part of the police investigation, detectives conducted a dramatic raid of the Speddings' home in Bonny Hills, and their business in Laurieton, on the New South Wales mid north coast.

A mother of one child, who lived with the Speddings, said she was shocked to learn that Mr Spedding was a person of interest in William Tyrell's disappearance

William, 3, went missing from his grandmother's home in Kendall, NSW, on September 12 while wearing his favourite Spiderman costume and while he was playing in the backyard with his sister.

The mother of one of the children who had lived with the Speddings, who said her child was taken from her home following a domestic situation in 2011, said she was shocked to discover Mr Spedding was being questioned over William's disappearance.

The woman told The Daily Telegraph that she was informed about the FACs investigation into Mr Spedding back in December but was not told any further details. 

'I saw Bill Spedding on TV and I rang FACs,' she said.

A FACS spokesman declined to comment on the case as it was still under investigation, the paper reported.

Homicide detectives have taken over the investigation of  William Tyrell who disappeared on September 12

The Speddings told Nine News they had nothing to do with the disappearance of the toddler, and are trying to stay strong for each other and their family.

'We're both close to a nervous breakdown. We're co-operating with police,' Mr Spedding, 63, told Nine News reported Chris O'Keefe.

Margaret Spedding also spoke about their experience, and said she was grateful for the support she and her husband had received from their community.

'We just have to do what we have to. We mainly want to thank our friends and family for the support we have been given,' said Mrs Spedding.

The couple appeared to be emotional in the interview, and Mrs Spedding broke down as she spoke of the past few days.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, forensic police and detectives extensively searched a set of rooms under the home, excavated part of the backyard and drained the septic tank of William Spedding's Bonny Hills property, near Port Macquarie on the NSW mid north coast.

'We're both close to a nervous breakdown. We're co-operating with police,' Mr Spedding, 63, told Nine News reported Chris O'Keefe

Detectives tore down police tape surrounding the property on Thursday. 

Mrs Spedding said that she was concerned about how the ordeal would impact upon her family.

'It's the children I'm worried about, this affects them too,' she told Nine News.

The couple said they were determined to band together, despite their difficult experience. 

'We’ll get through this,' said Mrs Spedding.

'We'll stick together and get through it,' said Mr Spedding.

Margaret Spedding also spoke about their experience, and said she was grateful for the support she and her husband had received from their community

ret are on the verge of nervous breakdowns and, really, their life has been somewhat ruined.'

Earlier Mr Spedding, who was questioned and released without charge, told Channel 9: 'It has been very difficult. I wish to thank our family, our friends for the overwhelming support that we have received from them over this time.'  

Police are forensically examining and testing excavations from the burn-off pit, material from the septic tank and three paper bags of items taken from the rooms under the house, which is expected to take weeks.

Packing up: A detective removes crime scene tape from the Bonny Hills home on the mid north NSW coast of Bill and Margaret Spedding as they finish their search and will now spend weeks forensically analysing material from a septic tank and other evidence at a laboratory.

Full scale search: Police have now concluded their raid raided on two properties - a  former pawn-broking store in Laurieton, around 10km east of Kendall, and a house in Bonny Hills, a further 10km north of Laurieton - which are the office and house of whitegoods repairman, Bill Spedding
