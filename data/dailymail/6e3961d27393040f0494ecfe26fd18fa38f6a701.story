South Korea overcame the loss of star winger Lee Chung-yong to move to the brink of reaching the Asian Cup quarter-finals with a 1-0 win over Kuwait on Tuesday.

The South Koreans made seven changes from the line-up that opened with a 1-0 win over Oman, with injuries and illness forcing a reshuffle. Nam Tae-hee’s first-half header was enough to give two-time champions a second win and six points in Group A.

The Koreans had a setback before kick-off when it was confirmed Lee, who plays for English club Bolton, had fractured his shin and would fly home. Lee was injured in the win over Oman last weekend.

Booked: Fahad Awad

Referee: Alireza Faghani 

It is unlikely he will participate in the rest of the tournament, which finishes with the final on January 31.

Right-back Kim Chang-soo also failed to recover from his injury, while attacker Son Heung-min, midfielder Koo Ja-cheol and goalkeeper Kim Jin-hyun were all kept off the team due to sickness.

The replacements made heavy work of Kuwait, defeated 4-1 by Australia four days previously.

The only goal of the game came eight minutes before half-time when Nam headed home a perfect Cha Du-ri cross.

The second half was a tough one for the Koreans, who were on the back foot for the majority of it. A shot from Ali Al Maqseed hit the post early in the period and was a signal for an extended period of Kuwaiti pressure.

Despite plenty of possession, pressure and chances, Kuwait couldn’t find a way past South Korea goalkeeper Kim Seung-gyu.

Kuwait are almost certainly out of contention at the tournament following back-to-back defeats.

South Korea now move to Brisbane to face hosts Australia in the last group game on Saturday, when Kuwait meet Oman in Newcastle.
