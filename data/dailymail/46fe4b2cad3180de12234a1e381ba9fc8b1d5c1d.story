Cordarrelle Patterson is generating a lot of attention, but you get the impression he doesn't mind a bit.

Both Minnesota Vikings team-mate Greg Jennings and Sports Illustrated have talked up the second-year receiver ahead of the new NFL season. 

And with new offensive co-ordinator Norv Turner designing the playbook, Patterson sounds pretty excited.

'Ah man! His offensive mind! He knows everything perfect, man. And that’s what you need to have - an offensive brain like him. The things he did last year! To have him here is just a blessing for me and my team mates. We feel like he's coming in and we can do great things for him.'

Turner trademarks include a strong running game, a vertical, deep ball threat and a tight end-friendly offense.

With Adrian Peterson, Patterson, Jennings and Kyle Rudolph on board, the Vikings could be set for an exciting season.

'Everybody’s going to touch the ball, not just one person be the star. Everybody’s going to have their time to shine,' Patterson purrs.

And Rudolph, who recently signed a five-year contract extension worth $36.5million, is all set to play his part after an injury-hit 2013 season.

'That’s my guy, man! Last year in my rookie year I was always training with him,' Patterson says. 'So I’ve seen the things he can do on the field. He’s the best tight end I’ve been around, so when he got that new deal I expect great things out of him.'

Patterson is an infectious character with a zest for life.

Nicknamed Flash, the 2013 first-round pick initially struggled with route running and timing, but shone as a return specialist, reaching the Pro Bowl.

The electrifying 22-year-old returned 43 kickoffs for 1,393 yards and two touchdowns of 109 and 105 yards, with an NFL-leading 32.4-yard average.

And in the final six games of the season, he showed much of his explosive potential as a receiver.

Asked if he has any expectations, he laughed: 'I really don’t know, man… I hope I have a great year. I hope I can continue the year from last year, the last six games I had.'

While Turner will be vital to his development, the impact of Mike Zimmer will also be key.

'He’s a great guy. He’s a hard man,' says Patterson of the notorious disciplinarian, who was handed his first role as head coach in January.

'He’s going to let you have it, but at the end of the day he’s a mind. A great defensive mind. And a great coach. Day in day out.

'I like to write stuff down in my notebook in my iPad. Just take notes. You just try to learn from that and be good. Not to just be good, but I want to be great on the field.'

While veteran quarterback Matt Cassel is expected to start for the season-opener in St Louis, 23-year-old Patterson had his own way of welcoming Teddy Bridgewater, the 32nd draft pick and future face of the franchise.

Following his arrival in the Twin Cities in May, Patterson thought it prudent to welcome him to the Midwest by taking him to an NHL playoff game between the Minnesota Wild and the Chicago Blackhawks.

'You’ve got to get that vibe with your quarterback!', he says.

'Teddy’s just like me, coming in as a rookie.  Coming in the first round, people expect a lot of things out of you. He’s been great. Learning how to be a quarterback. I see a bright future ahead of Teddy.'

Is Teddy ready? Bridgewater made his eagerly-awaited debut against the Raiders, but will he start in St Louis?
