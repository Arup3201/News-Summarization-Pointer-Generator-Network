Nurses could face checks every three years to prove that they still care about their patients.

They may be made to undergo regular assessments which would hinge on the feedback of patients and their relatives.

NHS managers would collect up to 20 detailed comments from patients, family members and staff about the attitude of  individual nurses and their level of compassion.

The comments would be sent to the Nursing and Midwifery Council – along with assessments on overall ability – and those who fall short could be struck off.

The watchdog is considering the checks in the wake of the Mid Staffordshire Hospital scandal where some staff were said to have become 'immune to the sound of pain'.

Last summer two senior nurses working in the hospital's A&E department were struck off after being accused of conspiring to fiddle figures on waiting times. Sharon Turner, 48, and Tracey White, 52 were accused of ruling the unit 'with fear' by bullying and coercing staff to cover up poor care.

The NMC was heavily criticised by an inquiry into the scandal   which warned it was not doing enough to protect patients from poor nurses.

There are currently very few checks on nurses. They only have to prove they have completed 450 hours of work and 35 hours of learning every three years.

The new assessments – known as revalidation – would involve nurses having to collate between five and 20 pieces of feedback from colleagues, patients, relatives and carers.

These would probably be gathered by nurses' managers to prevent them being selective in asking for feedback.

Over the past few years the NHS has instructed universities only to recruit nurses  deemed capable of being compassionate.

But there is concern that some nurses who have been working for years have become jaded and do not always make care and kindness a priority.

The NMC yesterday launched a consultation on how the test will work and it is likely to announce further details later this year.

Dr Peter Carter, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: 'Patients deserve to know every nurse is fit to practise in a modern setting and competent for the role they are performing.

'We will be engaging with our members to inform them of the proposals as well as responding formally to the consultation.

'What we need to ensure is that nurses are properly supported to make the revalidation system work, whether through on-going post-registration training or through mentorship and supervision, as they are already experiencing very high workloads.'

Last February David Cameron criticised the NMC – and doctors' watchdog the General Medical Council – for failing to protect patients.

In a speech to the Commons shortly after the Mid Staffordshire inquiry, he said: 'We expect the professional regulators to strike off the doctors and nurses who seriously breach their professional code. But in Stafford [Hospital] those expectations were badly let down.'

The NMC has also been criticised for taking too long to reprimand failing nurses and for being overly bureaucratic.

Nurse checks would be similar to those introduced for doctors in 2012. The GMC is appraising all 260,000 GPs registered to practise in England, with the process expected to take three years.
