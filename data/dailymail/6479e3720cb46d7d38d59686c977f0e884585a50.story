A broken piece of track could be to blame for the commuter train collision outside New York City that injured more than 70 people.

Officials investigating the cause of the crash ruled out foul play, and sent a damaged section of railway track for analysis.

It is not clear if the accident 
was caused by the broken piece of track, or if it was damaged before the crash, said Earl Weener, of the National Transportation Safety Board.

He added that the investigation was in its early stages, and refused to speculate on why the train derailed near Bridgeport, at 6.10pm.

Seventy-two people were sent to hospital after a Metro-North train from New York City, derailed and was hit by a train coming from New Haven.

Senator Chris Murphy said it was 'frankly amazing' that none of the 700 people on board the two trains was killed.

'The damage is absolutely staggering,' Richard Blumenthal added.

The senator, who visited several patients in the hospital, described shattered interiors of carriages and tons of 
metal tossed around.

'The sides of cars are torn away like ribbons of cloth,' Mr Blumenthal told the CT Post.

'I feel that we are fortunate that even more 
injuries were not the result of this very tragic and unfortunate 
accident,' he said.

The National Transportation Safety Board began its investigation on Saturday, which is expected to last for seven to 10 days.

The board will examine the trains' brakes and condition, signal information and the performance of the crew.

Data recorders from the trains are 
expected to provide details on the speed of the trains and
other information.

'Our mission is to understand not just 
what happened but why it happened and determine ways of preventing it 
from happening again,' Mr Weener said.

Mr Blumenthal and Mr Murphy believe the reason there were no fatalities was because of improved Metro North carriages.

'[Passenger] 
safety, and the safety of our employees, is always the first priority in
everything we do,' Howard Permut, president of MTA Metro-North 
Railroad, said.

The railway tracks were damaged in the crash, and Amtrak was forced to suspend services between New York and Boston.

'All of the injured people described the
really harrowing experience of having the train jolt to a stop, the 
dust, darkness, other kinds of factors that made it particularly 
frightening,' Mr Blumenthal told CBS News.

The bravery of a train conductor, who helped passengers despite her own injuries, was highlighted by the senator.

'Her story is really one of great strength and courage helping other passengers,' he said.

Frank Bilotti, who was returning from a business trip in Boston, said: 'Everybody was pretty much tossed around.'

The 53-year-old from Westport, who was left with a sore neck, told Fox News: 'There were people on stretchers. There were people lying on the ground.'

He brought his teenage son to see the site of the crash on Saturday.

Staff at Sunlimited, a car customizing shop close to where the crash happened, at first blamed construction work for the noise.

'They're doing construction, pounding beams into the ground. All day long all you hear is, "Boom, boom, boom". We assumed it was the grand finale,' Steve Junker told CT Post.

Bridgeport Police Chief Joseph Gaudett said: 'Everybody seemed pretty calm. Everybody was thankful they didn't get seriously hurt. They were anxious to get home to their families.'

Metro-North is due to start removing the damaged
carriages and debris this week. Heavy
specialized equipment is due to be in place on Sunday.

Until the carriages have been removed, work can not start on repairing the track and overhead wires, which will cause disruption on the commuter line.
