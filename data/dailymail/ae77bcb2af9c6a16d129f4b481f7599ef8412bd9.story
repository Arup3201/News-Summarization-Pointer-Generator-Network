A man has died after suffering fatal burns while inside a portable toilet on Monday afternoon.

The man was discovered near Nikon Road in Harrisdale, southeast of Perth, at about 3pm on Monday, with severe burns to most of his body.

It is believed the 65-year-old Harrisdale man, who died in Royal Perth Hospital on Wednesday morning, was burned from a fire inside a portable toilet on a construction site.

Detective Senior Sergeant Tom Mills of Major Crime told ABC the man had sustained the most severe burns he had ever seen. 

'He's in a very very dangerous position as far as his health goes... they are the most horrific burns I've seen,' he said.

After being burned, the man walked into the construction property then wandered several hundred metres down Glenora Way.

He was found at about 3pm by two tradesmen working on a nearby home. The men doused him in water, called an ambulance and administered first aid.

The man's family spoke with police on Tuesday night. Police are no longer treating the incident as suspicious.

Authorities released photos of a Rip Curl watch and Rivers slip on shoes the man was wearing, as well as his Samsung mobile phone and a tattoo of a green butterfly on his right wrist.

Police are baffled as to how the fire was started and they are urging members of the public to come forward and assist with investigations.

'We're appealing to anyone who might have been in that area,' said Detective Mills.

'Other tradesmen who may have been working, although it was a public holiday, people who are building ... and may have been looking at the progress of their new homes, anyone who saw a man wandering around.'

Anyone who has any information about the incident on Monday should call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000
