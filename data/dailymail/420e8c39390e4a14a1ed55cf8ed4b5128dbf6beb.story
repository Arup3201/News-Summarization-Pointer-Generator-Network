Suge Knight has pleaded not guilty to a robbery charge filed over an incident in which a celebrity photographer accused the Death Row Records founder of stealing her camera.

The 49-year-old appeared in a Los Angeles courtroom Wednesday and had his bail set at $500,000.

He was arrested in Las Vegas last week and fell while in jail, and his attorneys said he bruised his head and neck.

Knight and comedian Katt Williams were charged with robbery Oct. 29. Both are accused of taking the photographer's camera in Beverly Hills on Sept. 5.

Beverly Hills police say they are still investigating the incident.

Knight could go to prison for 30 years to life if he is convicted.

Williams has not yet been arraigned.

He could face up to seven years behind bars.

The founder of Death Row Records was detained in Las Vegas, Nevada, while 41-year-old Katt was arrested as he arrived at the Inglewood Courthouse in Los Angeles to face charges relating to a separate assault case.

Beverly Hills Police confirmed to the MailOnline that while the arrests have been made, the investigation remains ongoing.

In a statement, the District Attorney's Office said the incident occurred outside a recording studio just days after Suge was shot in late August during Chris Brown's Pre-VMA party at a Hollywood nightclub.

According to the District Attorney's Office: 'The two men are suspected of stealing the camera of an independent celebrity photographer on Sept. 5 outside a studio in Beverly Hills.'

If found guilty, Suge faces significantly more time than Katt due to a previous assault with a deadly weapon conviction, the DA said.

'If convicted, Knight, who has a prior conviction for assault with a deadly weapon, faces up to 30 years to life in state prison. Williams faces up to seven years in custody.' 

Photos of the alleged incident show a woman nursing an injured finger, however, neither Katt nor Suge were pictured at the scene.

On Aug. 24, the rap mogul was shot six times inside Chris Brown's pre-VMA party at a Hollywood nightclub

Beverly Hills police Sgt. Max Subin told the LA Times that after coming out of the studio the comedian and hip hop mogul came across the photographer and allegedly chased the woman down an alley.

The officer said Kat then grabbed the woman's camera 'forcibly' and she 'sustained minor injuries'.

When police arrived on the scene, both of the stars had left, he said. Neither man has been charged with assault. 

Both Suge - whose real name is Marion - and Katt - real name Micah - have had their fair share of run-ins with police.

When he was arrested, Katt was to face court over a July 15 incident in Inglewood when he allegedly pepper-sprayed a man and tried to hit him with his car.

The comedian was charged with two counts of felony assault in addition to the use of tear gas.

That same month, Los Angeles County sheriffs were called to the Comedy Store in West Hollywood after reports he pulled out a gun and smashed a car window.

No charges were laid over that incident.

He was imprisoned twice more for violating his parole after being caught consorting with gang members and then assaulting a valet in 2003

Suge's rap sheet is a little longer, with the 49-year-old first arrested in 1992 on assault and weapons charges for which he received probation.

However in 1996, he was arrested after security cameras at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas caught him and a group of other men beating a gang member. He was sentenced to nine years in prison for parole violation. 

He was imprisoned twice more for violating his parole after being caught consorting with gang members and then assaulting a valet in 2003.

Suge has also been the victim of a number of serious crimes - and has been shot three times.

Besides getting shot in August, Suge was also injured in 2005, when he was shot in Miami during another pre-awards party.

Most famously he was hit by bullet fragments in 1996 in Las Vegas when he was sitting next to rapper Tupac Shakur during a drive-by hit on their car. Tupac did not survive.
