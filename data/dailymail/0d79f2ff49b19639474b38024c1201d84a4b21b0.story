Handsome Man of Steel star Henry Cavill, 30, has been named the celebrity women would most like to have a holiday romance with.

Almost half of women polled plumped for the currently single superhero, while David Beckham, 38, took second place with 42 per cent of the vote.

Scottish actor Gerard Butler, 43, completed the top three, racking up a respectable 33 per cent of the vote.

Cavill is currently preparing to reprise his role as Superman opposite Ben Affleck, who, it was revealed last week, will take the role of Batman.

Asked how he felt about the development by BBC presenter, Kevin Camplin, Cavill apparently declared that he was 'more than delighted' to star opposite the Argo actor.

But although few can boast the extraterrestrial powers (and flying technique) of Superman, Cavill did have some impressive rivals to see off in the poll.

The research, which was conducted by 
holiday website Latedeals.co.uk, asked 1000 British women aged between 
18 and 35 for their top three celebrity men.

Others to make the top 10 included Only God Forgives actor Ryan Gosling, 32, One Direction singer Harry Styles and diver Tom Daley, both 19.

Styles took sixth place with 28 per cent of the vote, just ahead of Prince Harry, 28, who accumulated an impressive 27 per cent.

The two Harrys were followed by Bond star Daniel Craig, 45, with 20 per cent, Twilight actor Robert Pattinson, 27, with 16 per cent and Black Eyed Peas singer Will.I.Am, 38, with 10 per cent.
