From cleaning up banana smeared floors to non-stop running around, bringing up a young family can feel like an endurance test at times.

And although this musical offering from Australian father of three Matthew Hodge won't make chores and stress go away, it might just put a smile on your face.

Set to Carl Orff's famous Carmina Burana, the Ode to Sleep Deprived Parents and Terrorising Toddlers, includes such lyrics as: 'Put my phone down/Where are your pants?', 'Why won't you sleep?/Is it your teeth?' - all of which will be instantly recognisable to the harassed parents of those entering the terrible twos.

Familiar? Hodge's lyrics will strike a chord with anyone who has or has had a toddler in their life

O' you terror!Get down from there!Mummy's getting cranky...

Put my phone down.Where are your pants?What have you done with my purse?Don't throw those blocks.What is that smell?Why do you look so happy?What's in your mouth?Who ripped that book?Why won't you just stop moving?

He's on the chair!Just standing there!Wobbling like a drunk man.Where is my mug?What was that crash?Who let you in the kitchen?You've got a knife!Put it down now!Don't wave it near your sister!

Put my phone down.Where are my apps?Who dialled triple zero?

Why won't you sleep?Is it your teeth?I need another coffee!My head's so sore!Look at the floor!Cleaning will take forever.

What's wrong with you?What did I do?Why do you do this to me?I hope when you... Have some kids too...They drive you crazy!

The new version of Carmina Burana, which has been used on scores of film soundtracks including Lord of the Rings, is the result of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra's 'Say it with Carmina' contest, which invited members of the Australian public to come up with new lyrics.

Despite competition that included odes to the Pope and one entrant's new pet cat, Hodge’s libretto received the most votes.

According to Hodge, who lives in Sydney, the ditty was inspired by his youngest son, who at just a year old, has started walking, climbing and generally causing mayhem in the Hodge household.

When he penned the winning lyrics, Hodge’s wife Rachel had just endured a 'night of limited sleep and a day of rampant destruction' with the toddler.

'(She) recognised many of the phrases instantly and given that our son threw her phone into the toilet two days later, they seemed very appropriate,' Hodge told TODAY Moms - a parenting blog linked to NBC's Today show.

'I put the lyrics together one lunchtime when I heard about the contest. The original lyrics refer to a relentless wheel of fate crushing the poet, and Carl Orff's music reflects that, with its short, sharp phrases and its repeating melodies.

'Somehow, the idea popped into my head that we speak to our children in ‘short, sharp phrases’ as well when we're telling them off.'

The winning entry was sung by the 200 members of the Sydney Philharmonia Choir and the resulting video posted on YouTube, where since last month, it has received more than 150,000 views.

'Parenting, while it's highly rewarding, is also a job that involves many frustrations and we constantly find ourselves barking orders to these little people that just won't listen,' added Hodge, who also revealed that he hopes to show the video to his son when he's older - ideally on his 21st birthday.

'So I think many parents have found themselves saying very similar things to their children.'
