Have you ever wondered the amount of organisation that goes into safely guiding aircraft across our skies?

Following up on our last video which focused on Europe, we now take our attention to the North Atlantic, which is often referred to as ‘the gateway to Europe’.

Every day, between two and three thousand aircraft fly between Canada, the United States and Europe.

And this stunning video, created by NATS (the National Air Traffic Services),  shows every single airplane that went through the five 
major air spaces over the North Atlantic during a 24 hour period in August last year, but condensed to two minutes.

The video tracks the movement of flights over the course of 24 hours - highlighting the complexity of the routes and how they manage to fly across the continent without crashing into each other.

Flight path video: The North Atlantic is one of the most popular routes in the world

This visualisation from data visualisation experts 422 South shows 2,524 flights crossing the North Atlantic, of which 1,273 pass 
through the Shanwick Oceanic Control Area. At its busiest traffic can peak at 1,500 
flights a day in the summer.

NATS, from its control centre in Prestwick, is responsible for providing the air traffic control service to the Shanwick OCA, which is the busiest of all North Atlantic Airspace regions.

Around 80% of all North Atlantic Air Traffic passes through it, demonstrating the strategic importance of Prestwick Centre and UK airspace.

Paul Beauchamp, NATS spokesman said: “Airspace is an incredibly valuable asset – just as important as the rail, road and utility networks that everyone relies on everyday.

‘However, most people aren’t aware of the work that goes into managing and safely guiding aircraft through our skies.

‘That’s why we created this visualisation to highlight the complexity of that work, the skill of our air traffic controllers and the UK’s strategic importance as the aviation gateway to Europe and North America.’

Data visualisation experts 422 South combined 24 hours worth of flight radar data from all UK flights on one of the busiest days of last year, and blended it with flight schedules and routing information for the rest of Europe – reaching out into the North Atlantic. 

Computer artists used specially developed programmes to convert the longitude, latitude and height data into luminous dots, which were accurately positioned over satellite images of Britain and mainland Europe, by day and by night.

Beauchamp continued: 'European airspace is some of the busiest and most complex anywhere in the world. Every day thousands of air traffic controllers guide millions of passengers safely to their destinations.

'Yet to most people, the choreography going on above them is entirely unnoticed - it quite literally goes over their heads. Some might say that is how it should be.

'But, that ignores one very important point. Getting it right matters and we all have a stake in it.'
