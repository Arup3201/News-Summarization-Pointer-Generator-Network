The date and time of the new royal baby's birth indicate that he will be highly intuitive and kind by nature, according to a top psychic.

Fourth-generation psychic medium Linda Lauren, who is based in New Jersey, observed the date and time of the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's new son to assess the colours and energy around him.

She told MailOnline: 'Being born on July 22nd astrologically puts the new baby on the cusp of 
his birth sign (like his father the month prior, June 21) of emotionally
sensitive sign of Cancer and the willful and sensitive sign of Leo. 

Sharing signs: The Royal baby is a Cancerian like Prince William, pictured left, with a moon in Capricorn - the same star-sign as mother Kate, pictured right

'His energy is that of someone who will be highly intuitive and kind by 
nature due to his birth during a full moon cycle.'

The psychic's observation that the blue and green energy around the future king indicate prosperity comes as little surprise, however she did note that the colours mean that the infant can expect good health and a way with words.

'He will probably talk early,' she said.

The infant's sensitive nature will have a strong guiding hand in his mother, she says - but may experience friction with his father over emotional issues.

sensitive Cancer and willful and sensitive Leo'

'This family will be led by the strong, orderly person in Catherine as a grounded Capricorn,' she says.

'The energy they share as a family is very blue and purple which tells me that Prince William will bump heads with his son on issues of emotion but they will always reason it out. Overall colour: yellow, a very easy, happy vibe.'

William and Catherine welcomed their new son at 4.24pm this afternoon at St Mary's Hospital in London.

The baby's star sign, Cancer, is one shared by his father and late grandmother Diana, Princess of Wales.

Happy news: The official notice at Buckingham Palace announcing the birth of the royal baby at 4.24pm. It means he is a Cancer, but had he been born half an hour later, he would have been a Leo

Had he been born after 4.54 today, the 
child would have been a Leo, like its great aunt Princess Margaret, 
Countess of Snowdon, and Princess Anne.

The Duchess of Cambridge went into 
labour at 5.30am this morning - with many suggesting the  approaching 
full moon at 11.16am helped bring on the contractions.

Prince
William was by his wife's side at the private Lindo Wing of St Mary’s 
Hospital in Paddington, west London, where he himself was born in 1982.

Traditionally
those born under the sign of Cancer arrive between June 22nd and July 
22nd although the exact dates vary slightly every year.

Famous
Cancerians include former South African president Nelson Mandela, 
Hollywood actors Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise, and Edward 
VIII, who gave up the throne for American divorcee Wallis Simpson.

Astrologer Patrick Arundell said the 
future king or queen will be more conventional because it is a 
Cancerian, but would have been more of a ground-breaker if he was born 
tomorrow as a Leo.

'Mars 
and Jupiter are conjunct in Cancer and that will give the baby a 
tremendous amount of go-get energy and that is already in motion,' he 
said.

He added: 'Venus and the Sun are also
in a magnetic connection which will give the baby a star quality and a 
sparkling charisma.'

Meanwhile
there have been numerous theories as to what caused the Duchess of 
Cambridge to go into labour - whether it was the full moon, an electrical
storm or just conventional 'Baby Mean Time'.

Maternity wards are said to be busier 
during a full moon, although there is debate in the medical world about 
whether the moon does encourage women to go into labour.

Wales, pictured (left) in 1985. Had he been a Leo, he would have shared a sign with Princess Margaret, pictured in 1960

Mervi Jokinen, of the Royal College of Midwives, said midwives often talk of how the full moon makes for a busy spate of deliveries.

'It's always sort of been an old 
wives tale saying that the full moon brings women into labour. Midwives 
usually do say "I'm on call. It's a full moon. I'll be busy tonight",' 
she said.

'There was a 
study about 20 years ago at a hospital near the River Thames which is a 
tidal river and it showed that on the full moon they did have more 
births.

'The idea is that because the baby is 
surrounded by water, the time of the full moon and the high tide causes 
the waters to break. But there's not enough scientific evidence to show 
it's proven.'

Waiting game: Members of the world's media gathered outside The Lindo Wing when The Duchess Of Cambridge went into labour at St Mary's Hospital in London this morning

Birth coach Zara de Candole, of Doula UK, said: 'As a doula (birth coach) who has supported many women in labour, there does seem to be some link between labour kick starting and a full moon.'

There are also suggestions electrical storms and a drop in barometric pressure can bring on labour.

Western central London - near William and Kate's Kensington Palace apartment - experienced isolated heavy rain, thunder and lightning strikes at 6am this morning - just at Kate was admitted to the Lindo wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington.

Chris Burton, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said: 'We've had high pressure with the sunshine but now there's low pressure and it's hot and humid which can cause thunder storms.'
