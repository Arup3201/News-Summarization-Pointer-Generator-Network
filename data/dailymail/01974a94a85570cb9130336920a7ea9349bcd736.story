The family of a man with Downs Syndrome who died in police custody are disappointed that a grand jury today declined to indict the three Maryland sheriff's deputies involved in his death, according to their lawyer.

Baltimore attorney Sharon Krevor-Weisbaum represents the family of Robert Ethan Saylor, 26, of New Market, who died after being forcibly removed from a movie theater on January 12.

Krevor-Weisbaum said on Friday that the family is also troubled that the Frederick County Sheriff's Office investigated its own officers.

No charges: A grand jury ruled on Friday that the three Maryland sheriff's deputies involved in the death of Robert Saylor, left, at a Westview movie theater, right, will not face criminal charges

The attorney said that the family wants to review the investigative file and autopsy report before deciding how to proceed.

The tragic incident happened while the off-duty deputies were trying to remove 
Saylor from the Westview Cinema at the management's request.

State's Attorney J. Charles Smith said that Lt. Scott Jewell, Sgt. Rich Rochford and Deputy First Class James Harris would not face criminal charges in Saylor's death.

Saylor, who often went by his middle name Ethan, suffocated to death at the Westview Stadium 16 cinema in Frederick.

The Frederick County Sheriff's Office says the deputies were moonlighting as mall security officers when they were called because Saylor refused to leave the theater. 

They found Saylor with a health aide refusing to leave the screen where they had been watching Zero Dark Thirty.

The agency says they handcuffed Saylor and forced him to the ground after he resisted arrest and cursed at them.

Smith said at a news conference that 
at no point during the brief encounter did the deputies use force at 
Saylor's neck or above his shoulders.

He said Saylor was handcuffed and on 
his stomach for one to two minutes. Smith said that when Saylor began 
showing signs of a medical emergency, the deputies removed the handcuffs
and administered CPR.

Smith said the medical 
examiner's report says Saylor died of asphyxia, with contributing 
factors that included obesity and cardiovascular disease.

He said the ME found that Saylor's health was compromised by physical conditions that made him more susceptible to sudden death. Smith called Saylor's death a 'tragic and untimely loss.'

Patrick McAndrew, a lawyer for the 
three officers, said 'each one of these deputies is the consummate law 
enforcement professional' and did what his training dictated.

In February the Baltimore County 
Medical Examiner's office declared that 26-year-old Robert Saylor died 
by homicide while being taken into custody by the three officers, ABC News reported.

The New Market man, remembered for his love of music, was handcuffed and allegedly resisted arrest.

According
to ABC it was alleged his face was put to the ground when he was being 
apprehended by the officers, who then realized he was suffering a 
'medical emergency'.

The officers removed the handcuffs, administered first aid and took him to Frederick Memorial Hospital where he later died.

'They made numerous attempts to get him to leave, he was cursing at them, at that point they psychically removed him, and he began having the medical emergency,' says Cpl. Jennifer Bailey, of the Frederick County Sheriff's Office told YourState4.com.

'They immediately removed the handcuffs and administered first aid. It's a very sad case, and not something we see everyday.'

Saylor's mother, Patti Saylor, told the ABC her son should never have been arrested.

'He has never had anyone put their hands on him in their life,' says Patti Saylor. 'He would not have been doing anything threatening to anybody.'

Saylor was said to be a 'cherished member of Damascus Road Community Church' where he was a member of the men’s choir.
