Prostitution and drug dealing provide a £10billion boost to the economy, new research revealed today.

Bizarre new European rules mean that for the first time illegal activities must be included in the official estimates of the size of the economy.

It means a booming sex trade or an expansion in cannabis factories will provide a boost to George Osborne’s economic outlook.

Illegal drug production and dealing accounts for £4.4billion of the UK economy while prostitution is worth £5.3billion to GDP, the ONS said

Every three months the Office for National Statistics produces an estimate of the size of the economy, or Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

It covers every area of activity, from manufacturing and construction to agriculture, public services and tourism.

However, from this autumn the figures will also have to include the value of illegal drugs and prostitution for the first time.

It will cover the import, production and sale of illegal drugs and the ‘provision of prostitution services’

Based on 2009 levels, the prostitution is expected to add £5.3 billion to the economy and £4.4 billion attributable to illegal drugs.

The new economic rules mean a booming sex and drugs trade would be good news for Chancellor George Osborne

In all years between 1997 and 2009 the impact ranges from £7 billion to £11 billion.

The data will class growing drugs or importing them as ‘production’, buying them for home use as ‘expenditure’ and selling them as ‘income’.

It covers crack cocaine, powder cocaine, heroin, cannabis, ecstasy and amphetamines.

In a detailed briefing note, published today, the ONS examines how ‘UK cannabis production is not balanced’ because ‘domestic output increases by the value of sales and this is the increase in supply’.

It adds: ‘Household final consumption expenditure (HHFCE) increases by the value of sales; less the value of electricity consumed, and intermediate consumption increases by the value of the seeds and planting stock and electricity used in production.

‘So there is “extra” demand equal to the value of the seeds and planting stock used. This is because we assume that the seeds and planting stock were previously recorded on the supply side but not the demand side.’

For prostitution, spending on renting brothels, and buying condoms and ‘working clothes’ will be classed under ‘production’.

While some EU countries give a detailed breakdown of prostitution types such as ‘street’ and ‘escorts’, the UK is not able to do this with the data available.

The ONS adds: ‘Extensive data gaps have been filled with assumptions, recognising that this area of the economy is very difficult to measure.’

It will look at the total number of men aged over 16 - the ‘size of the market’ - as well as rises in the cost of clothes, condoms and renting rooms.

A raft of changes to GDP is expected to add a total of £33billion , or 2.3 per cent, in current prices in 2009.

It includes changes to financial services, household spending, families buying brand new cars and people building their own homes.
