A Florida mother has been charged in the death of her 11-month-old son whom authorities say she left inside her hot car making her third related arrest only months after social workers deemed her children to be 'safe.'

Catalina Marista Bruno, 30, was charged with aggravated manslaughter in Miami-Dade County on Saturday after her sonâ€™s unconscious body was pulled from her car with a temperature of 109-degrees on Thursday.

Police say Bruno left her son, Bryan Miguel Osceola, in the vehicle around noon and forgot about him.

After an undetermined amount of time passed, the boy's father told police that he asked Bruno where the child was.

The mother recalled leaving him in the vehicle. That's when the child's father, Amos Osceola, ran outside and pulled his son's body out of the car.

A beer can and the mother's purse were also found inside the vehicle, the Miami Herald reports.

This week's arrest marks Bruno's third on similar charges.

In November Bruno was arrested for child neglect and driving under the influence after she was found passed out behind her steering wheel with her infant son unstrapped in the front seat.

Police say she hit several walls before passing out, leaving the car in drive.

Behind bars: On Saturday a judge set Bruno's bail at $250,000 and took away her custody of her two surviving children and her right to unsupervised contact with minors if she posts

In July she was also found drinking by police who were called to her home over a report of domestic violence.

Her husband was arrested in that incident for beating her in front of their three young children.

But despite her arrests, Bruno never underwent alcohol treatment, parenting classes or any other services.

The Department of Children & Families said Bruno's children were at 'moderate' risk following July's domestic attack but otherwise deemed 'safe,' the Herald reports.

Bruno's attorney told NBC Miami that he doesn't believe her latest arrest shows substantial connection to her previous incidents with the DCF.

'With that underlying case there's a presumption of innocence. She has not been found guilty of that particular case. I don't think there's any allegation that there was any alcohol involved in this particular case. So, I don't think that case bears anything with respect to this case,' Frank Gaviria said.

Bruno's bond is set at $250,000 for her latest arrest.

A judge has ordered that if she is posts bond she not have any unsupervised contact with minors, custody of her two surviving children, be allowed to operate a vehicle and she would have to wear a GPS monitoring device while on house arrest.
