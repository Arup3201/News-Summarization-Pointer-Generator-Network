A morbidly obese bus inspector who tipped the scales at 31st 7lb has shed more than half his body weight after being shamed for taking up multiple seats on the tube.

Philip Kettle, 52, from Romford, was carrying around the equivalent of 128 bags of sugar in weight after eating unhealthily for almost two decades.

But after warnings from doctors and daily angry stares from commuters, Philip decided to overhaul his diet and now weighs a trim 14st 7lb.

Big change: Philip now weighs just 14st 7lb but used to weigh a mighty 31st 7lb and was morbidly obese

'When you are that size you become 
withdrawn, withdrawn from society, you don't want to go out to things 
because people will look at you,' Phillip revealed.

'You
become very self conscious that you are being scrutinised. Looks are 
one thing but the emotional side also takes a right pounding.

'I was ashamed. I was not proud of what I had done to myself over the years.'

At his biggest, Philip had a 60in waist and struggled with simple activities such as climbing the stairs and keeping up with his five-year-old grandson.

'I was eating chocolate bars and various junk food all the time - I have a very sweet tooth,' he added.

'But my health started to deteriorate. I had very high blood pressure. It was quite a shock to hear what the GP said. I was at that point in my life that I realised I had put my family through a lot by being this way.'

Particularly hard for Philip was the realisation that he might not live to see his grandson grow up, which made him increasingly desperate to shed the pounds.

'I was very overweight throughout my daughter's lives but now I have a grandson,' he said. 'I
didn't want him remembering his grandfather like that. I couldn't do 
anything about the past but I could so something about the future.

Relieved: Wife Denise, 52, is thrilled that her husband has finally managed to shift the pounds

Unhealthy: Philip was warned that he might not see his grandson grow up unless he lost weight

'I
had just carried on and put off doing something about it for years. But
it got to a point where I could not carry on. It was becoming too much.'

Philip's solution was to join Weightwatcher's where he was swiftly put on a programme that replaced daily English breakfasts and carb-laden sandwiches with healthy salads, fruit and vegetables.

Snacking was banned, while weekly weigh-ins helped to keep him on track as the pounds slowly but surely dropped off.

He also started walking everywhere and two years later, he now weighs just 14st 7lb and has a trim 34in waist.

'My
blood pressure is back to normal, I am physically fit and I'm off all 
my medication - the doctor said I have got my health back,' said Philip.

'I used to go 
everywhere in the car, even short journeys, but now I walk everywhere. I
walk to work and as much as I can and only use the car once a week.

'I'm even doing a 26-mile walk for charity, which before was something I could never of imagined doing.

'Everything has changed now. I have 
changed so much as a person and really come out of my shell. I've never 
been so happy. I look at myself in the mirror now and I can't believe 
it. 'My wife says I now 
turn heads for the right reasons. There are so many things I can do now 
that I would not do before.'

Happy ending: Philip says his impressive weight loss has made a huge positive difference to his life
