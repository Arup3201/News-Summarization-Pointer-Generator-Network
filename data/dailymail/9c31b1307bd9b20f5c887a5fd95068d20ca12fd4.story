Whether it's being used as a swanky party venue, floating showroom or private vessel, the Xhibitionist is certainly a boat designed to turn heads.

The 75 metre long vessel is an extravagant, multipurpose yacht which even comes with its own supercar.

Designed by Swedish-based car designer Eduard Gray, the slick ship's interior is decked out in Art Nouveau decor, with classic touches like a Steinway piano, a dual staircase, and fine crystal Baccarat lighting.

But you'll need Bruce Wayne's bank account if you want to buy one. The lead-in price is 2 million euros (£16million) for a 'basic' model.

Keeping with its automotive theme, the Xhibitionist has space for a car showroom and 'engine room', complete with exposed engines displayed behind glass walls.

Solar panels fold out from under a sleek car-hood-like deck to power the ship, and the panels double up as a concert space or helipad with space for three helicopters.

The fly deck even features a Jacuzzi, and by night, the superyacht glows in the dark thanks to oceanLED lighting.

As for the Xhibitionist's price? 'As far as investments go, the 75 m luxury yacht Xhibitionist concept resembles more of a real estate and marketing venture than a yacht.'

If you have to ask, you know you can't afford it.

Is it a boat, is it a car? No, it's a megayacht. The supercar designer's megaboat costs more than £16 million

Holy moley! A good sized helipad on deck ensures A-listers can be flown in if needed

Shiny shiny: Believe it or not this is actually the inside of the boat. It feels as large as an airplane hangar, but with an Art Nouvea vibe

Can we make it a car showroom? Apparently so, this boat is big enough to take an entire fleet of Bentleys

Opulence: Sofa space for chilling out, tick. But where's the television?

And where better to chill out and watch the sunset than atop the deck... hang on, is that a band playing up there?

It may look like a deep sea creature from the abyssal plains but this is just the megayacht with its lights on after dark

And of course every megayacht needs a megacar for those all important onshore errands. Right, have we run out of champagne again?
