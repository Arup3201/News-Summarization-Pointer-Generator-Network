Floyd Mayweather Jnr’s promotional company has been awarded a license to hold fights in New York.The city could now host Mayweather’s proposed rematch with Marcos Maidana on September 13.

The pound-for-pound No 1 has not fought outside Las Vegas since he stopped Sharmba Mitchell in Portland, Oregon in 2005.

Mayweather Promotions have yet to request a date to fight, however.

Out of Vegas? Floyd Mayweather Jnr may fight Marcos Maidana in New York after his promotion company received their license

Tough night: Marcos Maidana gave Mayweather a torrid time before the star won on points in Las Vegas

A spokesman for the state commission told the Daily News: ‘To request a date, the promoter would have to submit a Promoter Contest Request Form.

‘Mayweather Promotions has not yet formally submitted such a request for the September 13 date.’ Mayweather could face Maidana at the Barclays Centre in Brooklyn but Madison Square Garden is not in the running as it is hosting an Eagles concert on the same night.

The 37-year-old has partnered with Golden Boy for his recent fights but vowed not to work with the company after CEO Richard Schaefer departed.

Mayweather Promotions does not currently hold a license to promote shows in Las Vegas.

Mayweather appeared to confirm the rematch with Maidana last weekend when he told LaTenMedia: ‘September 13, back to business, Marcos Maidana vs Floyd Mayweather Part II.

‘Then in May, I’ll have a big surprise for you.’
