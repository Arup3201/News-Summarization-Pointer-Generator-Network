Guo Hong, 29, always has at least three or four male students for her cheerleading classes, which is highly unusual in China

There aren't many things which could entice groups of male students in China to sign up for cheerleading classes - but the 'most gorgeous' teacher in the country is certainly one of them.

Guo Hong, 29, started off teaching two classes at Zhejiang University in eastern China one semester ago but is now running twice as many.  

Though considered much more suitable for female students, it is proving very popular with many male ones also, no doubt keen to catch the eye of their beautiful instructor.  

The multiple national dance champion's class is so popular you now have to make it through a strict three stage application process to get in as the numbers applying are so high. 

Even students who haven't been selected have been known to turn up for Guo's lessons, which are the most popular PE classes at the university.

At least three or four male would-be cheerleaders are always lining up for lessons, which is highly unusual in conservative China. 

Not long ago Korea's 'most beautiful PE teacher' was a hot topic online, with fans posting about her 'angel's face with a devil's body' and lamenting 'it's such a pity she's other people's PE teacher.' 

But now China has its answer in Guo, after students posted pictures online which went viral, saying: 'Look at this, we definitely have the prettiest PE instructor in the country.'

Her classes  draw observers from the sidelines and participants who have already completed their credits for PE but have joined the course anyway.

Pharmacy major, Xu Qianhao, says that he is curious about this course and saw it as a fresh challenge. 

Even with the huge subscription rate he was able to still get through to secure his place. 

Xu said that the lessons are exciting and demanding and after one semester he feels he has a much better sense of coordination and the physical demands are greater than he expected.

Jiang is a Resources, Environment and Urban Planning student who has signed up for two semesters of the cheerleading course.

When asked why he replied, red faced: 'When I first applied it was because other students said that boys were able to get high final exam scores.

'I didn't expect that each lesson will be led from start to finish by the teacher which is very interesting. Also the teacher often chooses songs that are nice so I chose this course for two semesters.'

Guo said: 'I started artistic gymnastics when I was four years old and have been involved in sports since then. 

'I am a technical cheerleading national champion, competitive aerobics national champion, miss aerobics national champion so essentially all the courses that I trained in at university I have achieved national champion status in. 

'However at present I most like cheerleading.'

Zhejiang University's Cheerleading group was created by Guo after she arrived. At the time she had to recruit members one at a time as well as arrange the weekly training sessions. 

'Usually we train twice a week but when we are coming up to a competition we will train four to five times a week.

'The courses are free because I enjoy participating myself.'
