Video footage has emerged which shows the moment a stable-hand working at the Australian Flemington Races is punched in the face while she stood in the parading ring waiting for a winning horse to return.

The strapper, someone who looks after racehorses, was standing in the mounting yard at the racecourse, in Melbourne, Australia, on Crown Oaks Day, when a man appears to hit her in the face with his fist.

Chief steward Terry Bailey said he witnessed the incident 'with my own eyes'.

The man, believed to be employed by a rival stable, then fled down a tunnel towards the horse stalls. 

Police detained him shortly after the attack and the woman was treated by medical staff.

Mr Bailey said: 'Victoria Police are currently questioning him as well as he is a registered stablehand.

'I can tell you the woman was conscious when doctors examined her moments after the incident.'

According to News.com.au, strapper Colin West, who was standing yards away from the assault, said: 'He went up to her and punched her right in the face. Her glasses came off. 

'She stumbled a bit. She was very shocked.' 

The woman had been looking after the winner of the fifth race Black Cash.

Crown Oaks Day, traditionally known as 'ladies day', is the third day of the Melbourne Cup Carnival.
