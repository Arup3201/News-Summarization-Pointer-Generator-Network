A German neo-Nazi group is using modern technology to organise and showcase terrifying protests that have a chilling resemblance to the fascist torch rallies of the 1930s.

In one, hundreds of black-clad figures with white masks converged without warning on the streets of Bauzen, Germany, carrying torches and placards with extreme nationalist slogans.

The march, which took place on May 1, was disturbingly similar to the days of The Third Reich which saw the Nazi SA hold night rallies to honour Hitler.

Dark: The group wore black cloaks and white masks while carrying torches and placards in a disturbing echo of the fascist torch rallies of the 1930s

Calling itself 'Die Unsterblichen' (The Immortals) has been using text message to orchestrate such rallies all over Germany for several months as it makes it more difficult for the police to track their movements

Many of the clips end with slogans such as 'Make your short life immortal' or 'so that those to come don't forget that you were German'

Details of the demonstration have been reported by the New York Daily News, which cites Germany's Die Zeit newspaper as its source.

According to CNN, a group calling itself 'Die Unsterblichen' (The Immortals) has been using text message to orchestrate such rallies all over Germany for several months as it makes it more difficult for the police to track their movements.

Dr Hajo Funke, a professor at the Free University of Berlin, told CNN he believes the tactics employed by the Immortals are designed to attract young people to their cause

Embracing social media: The demonstrators upload videos of their marches onto YouTube and some have been watched by tens of thousands of viewers

Videos of their protests have then been uploaded onto YouTube, some of which have had tens of thousands of views.

Horrible history: The marches are disturbingly similar to the days of The Third Reich which saw the Nazi SA hold rallies to honour Hitler

According to Die Zeit, the group also uses the obsolete word 'Volkstod' which references the days of national socialism and is used by neo-Nazis to describe what they believe to be the downfall of the German race taking place under a democracy.

A neo-Nazi group, which first came up with the idea of organising flash mob protests in 2009, was banned by state authorities earlier this summer.

More than a dozen homes of known neo-Nazis have been raided by police in a bid to find the group's central leadership.
