Remarkable new images from the Rosetta spacecraft have revealed the surface of its comet like never before.

In the pictures an incredible amount of detail can be spotted - including boulders on the surface and dust moving across plains.

The images come as Esa prepares to attempt to land a probe on the comet in two weeks.

Esa, headquartered in Paris, has released new images of Rosetta's comet (mosaic shown). They reveal fascinating details on the surface including boulders. Sand dunes can also be seen on the comet's surface

The latest images of comet 67P/C-G were taken from a distance of 9.8km from the comet’s centre and revealed in a blog post by Esa.

Four new images have been released, which have been combined into one mosaic image.

In those images the scale is about 26 inches (66 cm) per pixel.

The mosaic covers about 3,940 to 4,430ft (1,200 to 1,350 metres) on the comet’s surface.

Towards the upper left of the image is an area of bright material that was cast in shadow in previous images, possibly at the base of a cliff.

A recent landslide of sorts may have uncovered this material.

Esa adds though that the brightness of the images is a little bit misleading, as the comet is actually blacker than coal.

In order to make features visible the images are grey-scaled and also set to a high contrast to make them appear brighter.

The images also take another look at a pyramid-like rock on the comet. This was named Cheops by Esa after the pyramid on Earth. It is seen here as the largest boulder just left and down of the centre

'Also not seen previously in this much detail are the two boulders just below the centre of the mosaic, one of which takes on a heart-shaped appearance from this angle,' Space Science Editor Emily Baldwin write for Esa on the blog.

'Zooming in reveals hints of a layered structure and both objects seems to be appearing from beneath the dusty layer, just like some of the smaller ‘boulders’ around them.'

Within the images can also be seen a mysterious pyramid-shaped rock that was previously spotted by Esa. It can be seen just above the middle in the mosaic.  

At around 82ft-tall (25 metres), the structure is one of the larger boulders seen on the comet and could help scientists better understand its history.

The 'pyramid' stood out among a group of boulders on the lower side of 67P/C-G's larger lobe – an area that has reminded scientists of the famous pyramids at Giza near Cairo in Egypt.

Esa named the structure Cheops, after the largest of those pyramids, the Great Pyramid, which was built as a tomb for the pharaoh Cheops around 2550 BC.

Rosetta has spent 10 years chasing down comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and is now in orbit around the 'ice mountain', edging in closer to its surface each day.

For a sense of scale, the comet is about three times the size of Ben Nevis and Rosetta is the size of a car with 105ft (32 metre) wings.

Rosetta took an incredible selfie of its 131ft (40 metre) solar wings gleaming against the darkness of space last week. In the background is the duck-shaped comet, Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, with its distinct 'head' and 'body' clearly visible

As Rosetta continues to survey and monitor the comet's surface in the next months, the scientists will be looking for clues to better explain the formation of the comet. 

Last month a 2.4 mile-wide (4km) region on the 'head' of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko was revealed as the spot for the daring landing of Rosetta's Philae probe.

The high-risk manoeuvre on November 12, if successful, will be the first time in history that a probe has been landed on a comet.

Scientists at mission control in Germany hope the spider-like probe will send back data that could answer questions on the origin of Earth's water and perhaps even life.

But they've warned that the landing should be seen as an 'exciting extra' on the Rosetta mission as the mission carries a 'high risk'.

The recent decision that the mission is 'go' for Site J confirms the timeline of events leading up to the landing of Philae on Rosetta.

Rosetta will release Philae at 08:35 GMT/09:35 CET on 12 November at a distance of approximately 14 miles (22.5km) from the centre of the comet.

The landing will be about seven hours later at around 15:30 GMT/16:30 CET.

During the seven-hour descent, Philae will take images and conduct science experiments, sampling the dust, gas and plasma environment close to the comet.

It will take a 'farewell' image of the Rosetta orbiter shortly after separation, along with a number of images as it approaches the comet surface.

It is expected that the first images from this sequence will be received on Earth several hours after separation.

Once safely on the surface, Philae will take a panorama of its surroundings. Again, this is expected back on Earth several hours later.

The first sequence of surface science experiments will begin about an hour after touchdown and will last for 64 hours, constrained by the lander's primary battery lifetime.

Longer-term study of the comet by Philae will depend on for how long and how well the batteries are able to recharge, which in turn is related to the amount of dust that settles on its solar panels.

In any case, it is expected that by March 2015, as the comet moves closer in its orbit towards the Sun, temperatures inside the lander will have reached levels too high to continue operations, and Philae's science mission will come to an end.

The Rosetta orbiter's mission will continue for much longer. It will accompany the comet as it grows in activity until their closest approach to the Sun in August 2015 and then as they head back towards the outer Solar System. 

The reconstructed-colour image indicates how dark the comet really appears. On average, the comet's surface reflects about four per cent of impinging visible light, making it as dark as coal
