It was Steven Gerrard who first sounded the warning: ‘We are playing against the best side in Europe and if we have two or three passengers it can become embarrassing against sides like this who are deadly’.

The Liverpool skipper, it seems, is wise before the event. For if the Premier League’s bottom club, Queens Park Rangers, can expose their shortcomings, then the European champions could well humiliate.

Just ask Ashley Cole and his Roma colleagues how brutal Bayern Munich were in their 7-1 demolition on Tuesday night, for the continent’s very best sides can be unforgiving if catching even illustrious opponents on an off-day.

Cristiano Ronaldo gets reacquainted with the English weather as Real Madrid train at Anfield on Tuesday

Ronaldo has been in scintillating form so far this season, scoring 19 goals so far 

Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has warned Real Madrid could punish them if they don't perform

At Anfield, on Wednesday, a lacklustre Liverpool would be torn to pieces – they might even play well and be soundly beaten.

For Real – and Cristiano Ronaldo – are not favourites to become the first team in history to defend a Champions League crown without very good reason.

Already this season Ronaldo himself has provided us with 19 reminders as to his unrelenting hunger for goals and glory.

Indeed, he has scored in every game he has played since La Liga kicked off in late August and is in the midst of a run of 16 goals in seven. With 15 in the league, he has two more than Liverpool have managed in total.

As Bayern Munich proved in their 7-1 thrashing of Roma, even European heavyweights can destroy each other

Carlo Ancelotti’s side have won their last seven on the spin – Levante and Athletic Bilbao demolished 5-0 in their last two – and any talk of an early-season stutter is now somewhat muted.

Meanwhile, in the Premier League, Liverpool continue to stumble in a post-Luis Suarez existence. They have dropped 11 points already this season and recent victories over QPR and West Brom were not without their scares.

Some supporters of a positive mindset may well point to Ronaldo’s record against them as reason for optimism, for in five appearances for Manchester United at Anfield he never once found the back of the net, scoring just twice in four fixtures at Old Trafford.

Ronaldo is within striking distance of Raul's Champions League goalscoring record

1. Raul (Real Madrid, Schalke) 71 goals

2. Cristiano Ronaldo (Manchester United, Real Madrid) 69

3. Lionel Messi (Barcelona) 69

4. Ruud van Nistelrooy (PSV Eindhoven, Manchester United, Real Madrid) 56

5. Thierry Henry (Monaco, Arsenal, Barcelona) 50

But the Portugal superstar only looks forward, not back, and his sights are now trained on yet another record – that of the Champions League greatest-ever goalscorer.

The 29-year-old – with 69 strikes in Europe’s premier competition – needs just three more to surpass Real Madrid legend Raul.

He will, of course, better that total, but with Barcelona’s Lionel Messi now tied with his Real counterpart following Tuesday’s goal against Ajax, Ronaldo will not want to afford his adversary the honour of taking the title before he does.

To that end, a hat-trick in front of The Kop would just about do it.

Gerrard wasn’t naming names when he guarded against Real’s ruthlessness, but we know who he meant.

Liverpool: you have been warned.
