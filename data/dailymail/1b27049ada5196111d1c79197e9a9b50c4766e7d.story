George W. Bush appeared to take aim at his successor President Obama in an interview aired today - as he suggested the draw down of troops in Iraq had allowed ISIS to flourish.

Speaking to CBS News in a two-part interview, the 68-year-old former president said he thought it was 'the right decision' to take military action in 2003 in a bid to oust Saddam Hussein.

But he added: 'My regret is that…a violent group of people have risen up again…This is "Al-Qaeda plus"…they need to be defeated. And I hope we do…I hope the strategy works.'

During the interview with Washington correspondent Bob Schieffer,  Bush also revealed that when he threatened to invade Iraq, then-president Hussein did not take him seriously.

'You know, when he was captured... I was told that the FBI agent that talked to him, he said "I just didn’t believe Bush,"' he said. 'And it’s hard for me to believe he didn’t believe me.'

'In retrospect…I don’t see how he could doubt my word,' Bush, who is currently promoting his new book, '41: A Portrait Of My Father', which is a biography of his father, George H.W. Bush, added.

The 2003 invasion of Iraq, which spanned March 19 to May 1 that year, signaled the start of the Iraq War, which claimed the lives of nearly half a million people.

In December 2011, under the orders of President Barack Obama, all U.S. troops departed from Iraq, bringing the American mission in the war-torn country to an end.

However, in the past few years, ISIS has quickly risen to power in  Iraq and Syria, taking control of swathes of both countries. In June, the terror group overran Mosul, Iraq's second largest city.

On Saturday, American warplanes reportedly launched a strike on a gathering of ISIS rebels in al-Qaim, Syria, critically wounding their leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. 

Bush's two-part interview will air on CBS News's Sunday Morning at 9am on Sunday, as well as the channel's 'Face The Nation' at 10.30am the same day.

In the biography, Bush also reveals his father, now 90, seriously considered not running for re-election in 1992, even though he loved his job.

This is because he felt his role was creating scrutiny of his son, Neil Bush, who was facing a federal lawsuit. 'It killed him to see Neil singled out because he was the President's son,' Bush wrote.

The book also discusses George H.W. Bush's decision to launch the first war in Iraq in 1991, his early failures in politics and his stinging defeat to Bill Clinton  in 1992.

The biography is set to be released on Tuesday, November 11.
