Ryanair could soon offer all-inclusive trips to holidaymakers as its chief marketing officer has hinted at plans to launch a holiday brand within the next five years.

The airline's chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs, who is tasked with improving its image, said it would be a ‘logical’ move for the Dublin-based carrier to expand into holidays to capture a larger share of the leisure market.

He revealed the plans as Europe’s largest budget airline is in the middle of a charm offensive in a bid to win over passengers.

Long criticised for its surcharges and customer service, Ryanair has softened its stance on baggage charges and booking conditions and introduced allocated seating and a new business class service.

It already offers bookings for hotel rooms, car hires and airport parking or transfers, but Mr Jacobs believes the no-frills carrier can do a better job of offering holiday packages.

He told TTG Digital: ‘If it becomes Ryanair Holidays at a point in time it is a logical way for the brand to go.

‘We do a version of it already. We can certainly do it better than we do. The way customers are responding to the new improved Ryanair, I think it will go forward.’

It comes as the airline attempts to shed its unsavoury image and tap into new markets to boost profits.

Mr Jacobs added: ‘People will say you will not have been able to do that with the old Ryanair.

‘We will always be a low-cost airline, but we are a travel business. We are starting to open our eyes to that opportunity.’

Ryanair insists its changes have already paid off with a rise in customers and earnings. The airline has also announced plans to move into more primary airports, and its flights are being sold again by travel agents after a ten-year hiatus.
