A teenager who was caught with a dead baby in her bag while she was allegedly shoplifting at a Victoria Secret in New York has not been charged over the macabre find.

Tiona Rodriguez, 17, was released Saturday without bail after she pleaded not guilty to petty larceny and possession of stolen property charges.

However, authorities say they cannot bring charges over the dead baby until forensic tests determine exactly how the full-term newborn died, which could take several weeks, according to the New York Post.

Preliminary
 reports from detectives suggest the fetus was born alive and possibly 
had been asphyxiated.

courtroom on Saturday where she pleaded not guilty to shoplifting 
charges

Thursday

'I
 don’t want to ignore the elephant in the room, but we are only 
arraigning the shoplifts,' Assistant District Attorney Robert 
Hettleman told the court, according to New York Daily News.

As
 the court released Estevez without bail, more than a dozen cops and 
detectives descended on her Queens home with a crime scene unit truck 
and two other vehicles, according to a neighbor.

Police
 believe Rodriguez gave birth in Estevez’s home on Wednesday. The 
investigators spent two hours going through an upstairs apartment where 
Estevez’s family lives.

Rodriguez was arrested on October 17 along with her friend Francis Estevez, 17, in a 
Victoria’s Secret shop on 34th Street in Midtown Manhattan.

The grisly discovery was made when the two girls were stopped by a 
security guard as they left the store in Herald Square on suspicion of 
shoplifting.

But as well as
 allegedly finding hundreds of dollars worth of stolen goods inside the 
bags, the guard noticed there was a strong odor inside and found a tiny 
body under the loot.

Rodriguez
 told detectives she had delivered a day earlier and didn't know what to
 do, authorities said. Police believe she delivered at the other girl's 
house.

‘Shoplifting with a 
baby in her bag the entire time certainly suggests a little bit of 
difficulty following society’s rules,’ assistant district attorney 
Robert Hettleman said in Manhattan Criminal Court on Saturday.

Hettleman said the matter was still under investigation.

‘The
 NYPD, my office and the office of the Chief Medical Examiner are going 
to continue to vigorously and thoroughly investigate the matter relating
 to the baby,’ he told the Post.

Rodriguez is due back in court on December 10.

Found: Investigators remove evidence bags containing the male fetus from the scene on Thursday

A recent autopsy of the dead baby was 
inconclusive, and more tests will be needed to determine how the fetus 
died, according to the city medical examiner's office.

But New York Police Department spokesman, 
John McCarthy, said that the case was still being investigated and that 
police were awaiting the medical examiners' determination of the cause 
of death.

After Rodriguez was arrested on Thursday she was taken to Bellevue Hospital and both girls were arrested on petit larceny charges.

A few hours later the fetus was removed 
by Medical Examiner's Office workers, who also removed other bags of 
potential evidence.

Medical attention: Tiona Rodriguez, who said she had had a miscarriage, is taken away in a wheelchair

A woman who said she was the other girl's mother said she hadn't spoken with her daughter since her arrest and hung up.

On her Facebook page late on 
Wednesday night, Rodriguez had complained about period cramps, and 
added that she was excited about an upcoming job interview at Chipotle.

Rodriguez and Estevez are both charged 
with petit larceny and criminal possession of stolen property. Estevez 
allegedly had $230 worth of clothes and cosmetics in her bag.

One of Tiona's neighbors said she was shocked to hear the teenager had been pregnant.

Zami
 Ford, 17, said: 'I’ve known her since she was little. She was probably 
nervous and didn't know what to do. She would never hurt anyone.'

She said she was unaware of the teen's pregnancy and was stunned by the allegations.

'She's a good girl. I can't believe she would do that.'

Health problems: Tiona had complained of period pains the day before she was stopped in Victoria's Secret

Teen mom: Tiona, who has a two-year-old son, told police she had a miscarriage the day before

Shocking discovery: A police officer outside the Victoria's Secret branch where a fetus was found in a bag

Another
 neighbor, Lydia Perez, said: 'She had to have hidden that pregnancy for
 a while. I saw her outside here the other day with her family, and her 
baby.

'There was a whole bunch of joy. You would never know there were 
any problems.'

Customers at 
Victoria’s Secret were also shocked to hear that a fetus was found in 
the store, but most sympathized with the schoolgirl. 

'She must be going through a big depression. She must have been wondering how she was going to get rid of it,' Yvonne Sonera told the Daily News.
