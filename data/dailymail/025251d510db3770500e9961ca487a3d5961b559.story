Council bureaucrats put a dampener on a summer fete when they banned children’s donkey rides over health and safety fears.

Just two days before an annual fete in Beighton, Sheffield, the council stepped in and halted the rides.

Sheffield City Council insisted that children had to wear helmets and that the animals’ owner must hold a riding school licence.

Steve 
Edmonds, one of the fete’s organisers, said: ‘Our donkey ride provider 
has been in  business for 30 years and has never heard of it.

‘It's just crazy, it's bureaucracy gone mad.

‘We were told this was needed to ensure the children had the right riding  helmets, but I can't remember ever seeing a child wearing a helmet while riding a donkey on the beach.

‘I'm frustrated the council left it until the last minute to tell us.’

Children enjoy a donkey ride at last year's fete. This year however, the donkey rides were cancelled when council officials said youngsters needed to wear helmets

Fellow organiser Tracey Higginbottom added: ‘It was a bombshell. There were a lot of disappointed faces.

Donkey owner George Smith, from Doncaster, was told he would need three licences to run the rides.

He already has public liability insurance and a beach licence for the animals and has now applied for the £125 riding establishment licence.

He said: ‘I've been doing events in Sheffield for more than nine years and I have never heard of it before.

Riding school licences are not required in similar events across Britain.

But Sheffield City Council said the Riding Establishments Act 1964 states people providing horse and donkey rides must have 'appropriate licences' whether at events or in riding schools.
