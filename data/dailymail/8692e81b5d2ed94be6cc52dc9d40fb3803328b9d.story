Miley Cyrus gyrating on-screen, Justin Bieber's childish antics and Russell Brand's incoherent political ramblings have been chosen as the most irritating things of the year.

The tiresome stars, whose performances have been endlessly documented, were singled out by 1,000 people asked to list the things that have annoyed them most in 2013.

They are joined by figures including Kim Kardashian, Katie Hopkins and Piers Morgan in a list highlighting individual events - such as the birth of Prince George, or Kim and Kanye West's own baby saga - as well as consistently irritating individuals such as Mr Brand.

Had enough: 35 per cent of people singled out Miley Cyrus as somebody who has annoyed them in the past year

Justin Bieber, whose questionable highlights this year included spitting on fans and abandoning his pet monkey, came top of the poll, with 36 per cent of people saying he annoyed them.

Miss Cyrus, whose 'twerking' performance with Robin Thicke at the VMA awards was widely condemned, came a close second, with 35 per cent of people objecting to her, according to the survey commissioned Ask Jeeves.

Russell Brand, who this year entered the political arena, calling for revolution and making appearances on Newsnight and Question Time, drew the ire of 28 per cent of those asked.

Other people to get on the nerves of the British public over the past 12 months, and probably for some time before then too, include Lady Gaga, Harry Styles and Piers Morgan - all of whom have a very active presence on social media.

However, while most of the issues on the lists were to do with celebrities, the single most annoying issue was the ongoing furore over energy prices, which has seen endless political posturing alongside painful price hikes of as much as 10 per cent.

Baby fatigue: Large numbers of people were irked by the high-profile pregnancies of Kim Kardashian, left, and the Duchess of Cambridge, right, pictured with babies North West and Prince George respectively

This was followed by the fuss over the twerking phenomenon, with Twitter selfies and the rise of the onesie close behind.

But drawn out baby sagas also annoyed Britain, from Simon Cowell’s prospective fatherhood to the royal baby announcement to the birth of North to Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.

With so much going on that made Brits feel either wound up or fed up, perhaps it is no surprise that 54 per cent said this year would be remembered as ‘average’.

Noisy: Celebrities who have a very active presence on social media, such as Piers Morgan, left, and Helen Flanagan, right, featured prominently on the list

A spokesman for Ask Jeeves said: 'There seems to have been plenty that got on our nerves this year from pop stars to politics.

'Perhaps it is because things seem flat after we had the Olympics and Jubilee in previous years that we found so many aspects of 2013 to be really annoying.

'The rise of social media also means that no matter how hard one tries to avoid Justin Bieber or the news of Simon Cowell’s impending fatherhood, it is simply not possible.'
