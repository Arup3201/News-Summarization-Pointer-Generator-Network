From Lady Gaga's meat dress to necklaces made from pheasant's skulls, some designers use all sorts of weird and wonderful materials in the name of fashion.

But the latest design is really quite hair-raising.

One company has unveiled the world's first fur coat made from 100 per cent male chest hair.

Hairy! The world's first fur coat made from 100 per cent male chest hair has been made as a protest against the widespread 'manning-down' of British men

The coat was commissioned by milk drink for men, Wing Co., as a protest against the widespread 'manning-down' of British men, typified by clean-shaven chests and emasculating fashion.

The coat, which features over one million strands of male chest hair, took a team of fashion designers over 200 hours to create and carries a hefty price tag of £2,499.

Whilst this may be the first garment to be designed using chest hair, human hair has been a popular and wacky choice of material for years.

A Croatian company, Artidjana, once designed an entire dress with 165ft of blonde human hair.

And Thelma Madine's Nico dressmakers, which has featured on Channel Four's Big Fat Gypsy Wedding, created a wedding dress made from human hair, which took over 300 hours to make and  weighed 15 stone.

For women too: The design is a rebellion against clean-shaven chests and emasculating fashion

Roadkill couture: Swan princess: Artist Jess Eaton's new roadkill couture collection includes bridal wear

Dramatic: You wouldn't miss this bride coming down the aisle in a head dress made from bird feathers

Bizarre: It might seem like the androgynous fashion trend taken too far, but a Chinese company's new 'hairy leg' hosiery hopes to help women ward off unwanted male attention
