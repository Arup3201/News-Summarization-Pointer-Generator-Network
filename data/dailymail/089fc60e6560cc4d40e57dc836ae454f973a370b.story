Justin Welby: Unaware of Wonga holding

The Church of England was condemned last night after revealing it will continue investing in Wonga.

Church leaders defended the decision saying they believe their money can improve the behaviour of companies that are less than ‘morally perfect’.

It came as the City of London Police announced it is considering launching a criminal investigation into the controversial payday loan firm’s bogus legal letters sent to tens of thousands of customers.

Regulators had previously insisted that an order to pay £2.6million in compensation to the 45,000 recipients was sufficient punishment. 

The church’s decision comes after a review by its Ethical Investment Advisory Group, the body which counsels church financiers on the morality of their investments.

The report was prompted after the Archbishop of Canterbury last year criticised Wonga without realising the CofE’s financial arm, the Church Commissioners, had holdings in the firm, which are believed to amount to between £75,000 and £90,000.

And in January, the Bishop of Manchester, the Right Reverend David Walker, said that Wonga’s lending was sinful, adding: ‘In the first few pages of the Bible, the serpent offers Adam an apple.

He’s tempted by the promise of a quick route to God-like wisdom. What he’s not reckoning on is just how much it will end up costing.’  

In the report, group chairman James Featherby said that the row had ‘highlighted some misconceptions about ethical investment, and in particular that its objective is to achieve a morally perfect portfolio’. 

He said: ‘It is no more realistic to desire that they invest only in morally perfect companies than it is to desire that any of us should relate only to morally perfect individuals.

‘When engaging with companies the investing bodies seek positive momentum not perfection. We usually only recommend divestment where we see no genuine desire for change.’

The Church of England controls one of the biggest and most powerful investment funds in the country.

The Church Commissioners, who maintain the historic assets of the church and fund 15 per cent of everything it spends, operate on such a scale that the investment in Wonga looks like the merest trifle.

Last year the commissioners’ holdings grew by £600million to reach a record £6.1billion.

Their chief, the First Church Estates Commissioner, former journalist Andreas Whittam Smith, said: ‘It was a very  good year for the portfolio.  Everything that could go right did go right.’

But such success, as the report from the Commissioner’s Ethical Investment Advisory Group made clear yesterday, is not based on squeamish thinking about the companies into which the investment goes.

The wealth of the fund is based on the centuries-old landholdings of the church, together with various windfalls such as Queen Anne’s Bounty, handed over in the early 18th Century to help impoverished clergymen, and which is now reckoned to be worth around a third of total assets.

He added that occasionally ethical investors, such as the church, would ‘graze their knees as they interact with a complex and ambiguous business world. But in our view, it is better to stay on the field of play than to sit on the sidelines’.

The investment in Wonga, arranged through a ‘pooled fund’ directed by a third party, would be treated according to the parable of the weeds in the St Matthew gospel, Mr Featherby said.

In the parable, weeds are allowed to grow with the wheat until harvest time, and only then separated from the wheat  and burned.

He went on to justify the decision to keep the investment by saying: ‘It is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick.’

Edward Mason, the group’s secretary, said that the furore surrounding Wonga over the past few days had been ‘very concerning’, adding: ‘We don’t like the business and we would rather we weren’t in it.’

But he said the potential loss from withdrawing was ‘disproportionate’. Because of the way pooled funds operate, a platform of investments would have to be pulled.

Police could reconsider launching a criminal investigation into the payday lender Wonga, it has been revealed

As a result the commissioners are said to have calculated that they will lose between £3million and £9million if they take their money out of Wonga.

The Archbishop, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, was on holiday and unavailable for comment yesterday.

Meanwhile the Reverend Rod Thomas, a Plymouth vicar who is chairman of the influential evangelical group Reform, criticised the church’s decision, saying: ‘I do not think the Church Commissioners have set out to do anything other than act in the best interests of the Church.

‘But once the facts are presented to them, it is up to the commissioners to do something about it.’

Andrea Minichiello Williams, of pressure group Christian Concern, and a member of the church’s General Synod, said: ‘The job of the Church is to tell the truth, and it should not be doing things that do a disservice to that task.’ 

The group’s report also said it would introduce lower ethical investment thresholds.

In future, it will withdraw money from firms with more than 10 per cent of their business in tobacco, gambling, high interest rate lending or human embryonic cloning, instead of the present threshold of 25 per cent.
