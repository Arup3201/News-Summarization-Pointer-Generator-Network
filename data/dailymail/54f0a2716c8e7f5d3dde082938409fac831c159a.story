Imagica Gilroy says staff at Parkside Pool in Cambridge told her not to breastfeed her son Riley, 19 months, as it was against the rules

Many mothers have run into opposition when they have breastfed a child in a public place.

But Imajica Gilroy was particularly 
taken aback when she was told to stop breastfeeding her son at a public 
swimming pool ... because it broke the ban on food and drink.

The 20-year-old hairdresser said she 
started feeding nine month-old Riley in the whirlpool bath to calm his 
nerves on his first visit to the baths.

She said: ‘I noticed I was being 
watched by a female member of staff. She then told a male colleague who 
came to me and said, “You are not allowed to feed inside the pool area”.

‘I told them I knew my rights that it
was against the law to stop me feeding, and they didn’t say anything 
else but it made everybody stare at me. I felt annoyed and intimidated.’

Miss Gilroy later posted a complaint on the Facebook page of the Parkside Pool in Cambridge.

She is still unhappy and plans to protest by staging a ‘nurse-in’ opposite the council-owned pool next month.

She said: ‘I’ve had quite a lot of support on Facebook already. Everyone is welcome, even if they’re not feeding.

‘I want to show Parkside Pool that 
breastfeeding is a wholly natural thing, and women should not feel 
awkward or segregated while feeding their baby.’

Colin Deans, general manager of 
Parkside Pool, said: ‘One of our lifeguard team spoke to a customer 
regarding breastfeeding in the pool which is in line with the training 
they have been given and our policy where no food or drink is to be 
consumed in the pool, which applies to customers of all ages.’

Staff at council-run Parkside Pool in Cambridge said they supported breastfeeding anywhere except in the pools

He added however: ‘Colleagues have 
been educated in training to ensure that they are informing customers 
that they can breastfeed on the poolside surround.

‘We do support breastfeeding at our sites wherever possible. We apologise for any inconvenience this has caused.

The Equality Act 2010 made it illegal to discriminate against a woman for breastfeeding in a public place.
