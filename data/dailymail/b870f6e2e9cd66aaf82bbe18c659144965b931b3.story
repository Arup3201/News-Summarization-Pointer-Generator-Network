Fair condition: Doctors still do not know what caused Teresa Heinz's seizure-like symptoms on Sunday

Teresa Heinz, the wife of U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and heir to a ketchup company fortune, has been flown by private jet from Nantucket to Boston for further treatment after having a seizure while on holiday at her family's vacation home.

Heinz was taken on a private plane to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston on Sunday night after doctors at Nantucket Cottage Hospital stabilized her, a spokesman for Kerry said.

The couple's spokesman said that her condition has improved and she has been upgraded from critical condition to 'fair' though she is still being kept under watch at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.

The secretary of state was with his 74-year-old wife as an ambulance first transported her from their $9.1million home to the island hospital, and also during her transfer to the Boston facility.

The New York Times cited one unidentified insider who says that she suffered from some kind of seizure.

'The
 family is grateful for the outpouring of support it has received and 
aware of the interest in her condition, but they ask for privacy at this
 time,' Mr Kerry's spokesman Glen Johnson said in a statement.

A hospital spokesman for the Nantucket 
hospital, ranked as the number one hospital in the United States by U.S. News & World Report, said Heinz arrived in critical condition, although 
doctors were able to stabilize her.

Shortly
 after 3:30 p.m. Sunday, emergency officials on Nantucket got a call 
requesting medical aid at their $9.1million home on Hulbert Avenue and 
dispatched an ambulance there, Nantucket Police Lt. Jerry Adams said.

Heinz is the widow of former U.S. Senator John Heinz, and heir to the Heinz ketchup fortune.

John Heinz died in April 1991 when a helicopter collided with a plane over a schoolyard in Merion, Pennsylvania. The senator was among seven people, including two children, who perished in the accident.

She has never disclosed her full wealth- even during her second husband John's presidential campaign in 2004- but she is estimated to have a personal net worth of somewhere between $750million and $1.2billion.

She and Kerry signed a prenuptial agreement before they got married in 1995 on Nantucket.

Heinz, seen with Kerry when the election results came in during the 2004 election, is said to be very happy that he is the Secretary of State and is okay with him traveling much of the year

lost the presidential election

In December 2009, doctors treated her for breast cancer.

Heinz previously has said she found in September 2009 that she had cancer in her left breast after having her annual mammogram.

A month later, she underwent lumpectomies on both breasts at a Washington hospital after doctors also discovered what they thought was a benign growth on her right breast.

That diagnosis was initially confirmed in postoperative pathology, but two other doctors later found it to be malignant.

In November 2009, Heinz had another pair of lumpectomies performed at Massachusetts General Hospital.

Before Sunday's emergency, John Kerry had been at the Nantucket home since returning from a nearly two-week, around-the-world diplomatic trip to the Mideast and Southeast Asia in the pre-dawn hours of July 3.

Before his wife's medical problem, he had planned to return to Washington on Monday and then co-host with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew high-level strategic and economic talks with senior Chinese officials on Wednesday and Thursday.

Kerry had also spoken of his desire to make his sixth trip to Israel as secretary starting at the end of the week.

State Department officials said Kerry's schedule may now change pending developments with his wife's health.
