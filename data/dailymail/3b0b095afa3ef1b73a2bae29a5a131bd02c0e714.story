A secret letter has revealed police have been investigating News International directors since 2012 for hacking scandal

A secret letter has revealed that Scotland Yard started investigating whether Rupert Murdoch and other News International directors had knowledge of bribes and phone hacking two years ago.

A secret document sent by the Met to Mr Murdoch's lawyers in 2012 confirms they are probing whether he and others, including former chairman Les Hinton, should be held to account after Andy Coulson was found guilty of leading a conspiracy to hack phones at the the News of the World last week.

The ABC's 4 Corners show has obtained a copy of the letter, which reporter Marian Wilkinson said the investigation was 'completely separate' to the one that brought a criminal conviction against former News of the World editor Andy Coulson earlier this month.

Ms Wilkinson said the confidential 
note, to be made public in tonight's documentary, shows that the phone 
hacking investigation 'could now well continue' and that the liability 
of Rupert Murdoch and his directors - including Mr Hinton - looks set to
 be the next avenue that police pursue.

'It is far from over,' Ms Wilkinson told Daily Mail Australia.

'This
 (letter) wasn't part of the criminal investigation into journalists, 
it's a separate investigation into the responsibility of the (News 
International) board of directors.'

Mr Murdoch, 83, is waiting to learn if News UK will face corporate charges over the phone hacking scandal, after Mr Coulson was convicted of conspiracy to hack phones at his trial last Tuesday.

He has reportedly been told by Scotland Yard that detectives want to interview him under caution as part of their investigation into alleged wrongdoing at the company.

Police have already interviewed Les Hinton, the former chairman of News International and Mr Murdoch’s right-hand man for decades, under caution in September 2012.

Mr Murdoch’s son James, a former executive chairman at News International, may also be questioned. Scotland Yard has refused to comment.

Sue Akers sent the confidential letter to Mr Murdoch's top London lawyer letting him know that police were investigating the 'corporate liability of News International' in relation to phone hacking and bribes to police

Former News International Chairman Les Hinton has already been interviewed by police over the hacking and bribery allegations

The letter, written by retired deputy assistant police commissioner Sue Akers and sent to Murdoch's legal adviser, Lord Grabiner QC, states that on May 18 2012 police were pursuing an 'active investigation into the corporate liability of News International in relation to phone hacking and illegal payments to public officials.'

Ms Wilkinson said at this point, the 
former News International chairman Les Hinton had already been 
interviewed by police regarding phone hacking and bribery at the 
company.

The ABC reported on its website
 that News International directors had been fully cooperative with the 
British police investigation into phone-hacking and pay-offs to police 
by Murdoch journalists.

Ms
 Wilkinson said directors were 'shocked' to hear that police were 
investigating their involvement and that lawyers believed UK police 
would not pursue corporate charges against News International, Mr 
Murdoch's UK company, which ran the News of the World and The Sun.

Dozens
 of News Of The World reporters have been charged or remain on bail 
accused of hacking phones and bribing public officials, but this letter 
is separate to the individual cases brought against journalists and 
instead looks at the involvement of company directors.

Ms Wilkinson said the the letter was sent to Murdoch's lawyer just six months before News Corporation split into two companies - its publishing arm, News Corporation, and his entertainment venture, 21st Century Fox.

The splitting of News Corp was long demanded by shareholders, but had been resisted by Mr Murdoch until 2012. It went ahead last year and has proved enormously successful for the Murdoch family and 21st Century Fox.

British Labour MP Chris Bryant, a victim of phone-hacking, told Four Corners he was aware police were considering bringing charges against members of the board.

'I know prosecuting authorities in this country and the United States of America are seriously considering bringing charges against members of the board of the UK company and the American company, News Corp,' he said.

MailOnline has contacted News UK for comment.

The ABC investigation, Rupert, Rebekah and Andy will air on ABC1's Four Corners program at 8.30pm tonight.
