The TorrX pump will inflate footballs and other sports equipment to precisely the right pressure

From goal line monitoring technology to high-tech boots and cooling shirts, football has got smarter.

Now there’s a pump called TorrX that automatically inflates footballs and other sports equipment to precisely the right pressure, in a bid to boost athletes’ performance and the quality of the game.

The idea is that balls that are correctly inflated travel further and faster in a straighter line than balls that are under or over inflated.

The TorrX electric pump will work on the same principle as a pump used to inflate car tyres so users can set the desired PSI (pounds per square inch), in order to keep balls at a specific hardness.

The Seattle-based inventors of the pump are raising money to put it into production on crowd funding website Kickstarter. 

Users begin by pushing in the electric pump’s end cap in order to switch it on, which will reveal the needle, like a conventional pump.

The needle can then be inserted into the ball’s air valve.

The pump will read the ball's air pressure, displaying it on the device’s screen, in either BAR - which is equal to the atmospheric pressure on Earth - or PSI.

Users who select manual mode, can then raise or lower the pressure of the air inside a ball by pressing the plus and minus buttons on the pump and feeling how well the ball is inflated.

The TorrX electric pump will work on the same principle as a pump used to inflate car tyres so users can set the desired PSI (pounds per square inch), in order to keep balls at a specific hardness. The device shows the pressure of a ball and buttons can be used to manually increase or decrease the PSI (pictured)

What: Smart ball pump that inflates or deflates balls to a precise pressure.

Function: Three buttons allow balls to be inflated or deflated manually, or an automatic mode means equipment can be inflated to a set pressure.

Display: The pump’s display shows a ball’s current and target pressure in either PSI or BAR.

Battery: The pump contains a lithium-ion battery that can be fully recharged in 90 minutes using a Micro USB connection.

Capacity: A full charge is enough to inflate 50 balls.

Or, they could type in the desired pressure and press the 'A' button for the ball to inflate, or deflate to the desired hardness automatically, without the need for manual labour.

The company said: ‘The TorrX smart ball pump makes every ball perfect so you can focus on your game.’

The electric pump contains a lithium-ion battery that can be recharged via a Micro USB cable.

It can top up or inflate 50 balls, with one full charge, its inventors claim.

They say it takes approximately 90 minutes to charge up fully.

The pump is available to pre-order on Kickstarter from £32 ($49), while the planned RRP will be £52 ($80). 

The affordable pump is set to be of interest to many amateur players and coaches, because balls that are correctly inflated, travel further and faster in a straighter line than balls that are under or over inflated, improving the game

The 2014 World Cup in Brazil was the most scientific and technologically advanced football tournament ever seen.

From smart clothing that keeps players cool, to advanced boots that enhance speed and skill, no stone was left unturned in providing the best experience for audiences and players alike.

World Cup referees used a foam, water-based vanishing spray to mark out lines for a free kick, which disappeared shortly afterwards.

Goal line technology was supplied by German company Goal Control, who used seven high-speed cameras at each goal mouth to monitor the action.

Used in every stadium, the system was able to tell the referee if a goal was scored within a second to an accuracy of 0.2 inches (0.5 centimetres), with the word 'GOAL' transmitted to a watch on the referee's wrist if the ball had crossed the line.

Smart boots also played a role in creating some memorable goals. Nike created the Mercurial Superfly boot, for example, which was sported by Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo and used a three-knit eave to put less material between the foot and the ball, enhancing the player's touch.

Similarly, shirts were engineered to keep players cool in the stifling temperatures and a smart training ball by Adidas helped players in training to provide analysis on their techniques via an app.
