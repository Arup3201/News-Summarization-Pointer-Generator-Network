The mother of a young girl left severely disabled by hospital failings has won a pay out of nearly £4 million.

Maryellen McDowall’s eight-year-old daughter Hollie was born with a significant brain injury due to medical errors during her birth at University Hospital Coventry.

The compensation was approved by the High Court sitting in Coventry yesterday morning.

The money will fund the care needed for 
the rest of Hollie’s life as, due to the trauma suffered at birth, she 
is unable to sit independently and is doubly incontinent.

Hollie McDowall, eight, suffered a severe brain injury when she was deprived of oxygen during her birth at University Hospital Coventry in 2005. As a result, she can't sit up independently, has limited vision, cannot communicate and is doubly incontinent. She also suffers seizures and will never be able to walk

The little girl is also unable to communicate and has limited vision.

She suffers from seizures and will never be able to walk.

Ms McDowall, who is from Coventry, brought a claim against University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust (UHCW).

At the hearing, she said: ‘Although I’m relieved this process is finally over, I remain concerned that the hospital has still not learnt from its mistakes and I think the public deserve to be reassured and to be provided with evidence that steps have been taken to ensure incidents like this are not allowed to happen.’

The court was told that following an uneventful and normal pregnancy, Ms McDowall arrived at the hospital at 2pm on April 18, 2005, with contractions.

The baby’s heart rate was monitored and, although there were some initial dips in the heart rate, was reported as normal.

Contractions continued through the night but by 11am the next day Ms McDowall was becoming very anxious as she had not felt the baby move since the previous evening.

Hollie's mother, Maryellen (right), has received almost £4m to help her pay for Hollie's care. She has been given a £1.7m lump sum and will receive annual payments to help with the cost of carers. Ms McDowall is pictured with her lawyer, Ally Taft

By 2.35pm, Ms McDowall was in excruciating pain and very distressed, and further drops in the heart rate were noted.

As a result, doctors were called but they did not arrive.

A ventouse delivery finally took place at 8.33pm when the baby's heart rate dropped dangerously low.

Baby Hollie was born floppy, pale and not breathing. She was resuscitated and transferred to the neonatal unit.

However, she was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy as a result of a significant brain injury, due to a lack of oxygen during the delivery.

The hospital has admitted negligence in failing to deliver Hollie sooner and admitted she would not have suffered any injury if she had been delivered.

The NHS Litigation Authority has agreed to pay a lump sum of £1.7 million plus annual payments for life to cover the costs of carers.

Meghana Pandit, Chief Medical Officer at University Hospital, said: ‘We are sincerely sorry for the indescribable distress Hollie and her family will have experienced.

‘We have taken steps to learn from what happened to Hollie and have 96 hours per week consultant presence on Labour Ward.

Ms McDowall says the compensation brings much-needed financial security for her disabled youngster

‘Furthermore, all women admitted to the Labour Ward with a complicated pregnancy are now reviewed by an obstetrician and a labour management plan is agreed and documented.

‘All staff now attend mandatory training sessions on electronic foetal monitoring and the use of foetal blood sampling.

‘The Trust has also implemented the use of a “Fresh Eyes” sticker, which prompts staff to double check a review of a foetal heart trace carried out by another colleague.

‘No amount of money can ever compensate for distress and suffering but I trust the family will take comfort knowing the financial settlement will go some way towards helping Hollie.’

Ms McDowall says the compensation brings much-needed financial security for her disabled youngster.

Speaking after yesterday’s High Court hearing in Coventry - in which the sum of £3,990,825 compensation was approved – she said the seven-figure pay out has brought peace of mind at last.

The 29-year-old told the Coventry 
Telegraph of her relief that the day had finally arrived, saying: ‘It’s 
good to know Hollie will always be cared for whatever happens to me or 
my partner in future, to know she will always have everything she 
needs.’

The mother-of-four admits at times it was a struggle to provide Hollie with the equipment and level of care she needed, especially with three younger children to look after - a two-and-three-quarter-year-old son, and 18-month-old twin daughters.

University Hospital Coventry has admitted negligence in failing to deliver Hollie sooner and admitted that she would not have suffered any injury if she had been delivered earlier

She said: ‘Hollie basically had what we could afford when we could afford it, but she never went without.

‘She always had everything she needed. I would rather go without myself.

‘It meant I didn’t do a lot of things that people my age would do, going out and things like that.’

The money will be looked after by the courts to ensure every penny will be spent on improving Hollie’s quality of life.

Immediate plans for the pay out include spending some of the money on a sensory room for Hollie in the family home.

The family get some help from night-time carers, but Ms McDowall says she will continue to devote the same amount of time herself to caring for her daughter, with the help of her partner Dean Frankton, aged 37.

She launched her legal fight when Hollie was six-months-old.

Speaking of her long battle for compensation, she added: ‘I’m just glad it’s all over now.

‘It’s been going on for such a long time - I never thought this day would come.’

The family’s solicitor, Ally Taft, head of clinical negligence at Alsters Kelley LLP, said: ‘Although the settlement sounds substantial, every penny will be required to look after Hollie properly and to provide her with the best care and equipment possible to try and improve her quality of life.

‘No amount of money can take back the severe injuries that Hollie suffered, although, hopefully it will make her and her family’s life more tolerable.’
