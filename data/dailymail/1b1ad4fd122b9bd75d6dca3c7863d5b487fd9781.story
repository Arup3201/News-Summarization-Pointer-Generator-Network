Facing jail: Terry Adams, 56, walked straight back into his criminal lifestyle and now faces years behind bars

Britain's most feared gangster could face years in prison over a £16,000 makeover.

Terry Adams, 56, walked out of jail after serving half of a seven-year sentence for money laundering and straight back into his high-rolling lifestyle.

He splashed £7,500 on a Harley Street facelift, up to £7,000 on dental work and £2,000 on gym membership at a luxury hotel used by the England football team, The Grove in Hertfordshire.

His wife Ruth even gave him back a prized £2,200 gold Cartier watch she bought at a police auction of his confiscated possessions.

But he failed to declare the spending spree to the authorities, breaking a court order forcing him to declare anything he owned or purchased worth more than £500.

Wearing a light blue cashmere Ralph Lauren sweater, Adams gently shook his head yesterday as he was jailed for eight weeks.

The former gangland boss could now be made to serve the remaining two years of his original sentence as his actions breached the terms of his release licence.

City of Westminster magistrates’ court heard that Adams has paid less than half of £750,000 of criminal assets he was ordered to hand over on his conviction in 2007.

District Judge Quentin Purdy said: ‘It 
seems to me you are a shrewd and calculating individual, quite clearly 
determined not to pay this money as you should.’

Adams built up an estimated fortune of £200million through a vast 
racketeering and drug trafficking empire with his brothers Tommy and 
Patsy.

The crime gang, known as the A Team, collected a huge portfolio of 
properties, antiques and art and has been linked to 25 murders.

The brothers were so feared that they franchised out the Adams name so 
lesser criminals could say they were working with or for them.

Police and MI5 bugged Adams’s mansion in Finchley, north London, as part
of a ten-year operation aimed at bringing down the crime lord.

The property, bought for £1million cash and now sold, was furnished with
antiques and paintings including Meissen figures and Henry Moore 
etchings.

Potential witnesses have been too terrified to testify against Adams but
he was jailed four years ago for the relatively minor charge of money 
laundering.

He was caught out by new ‘Al Capone’ laws designed to stop mobsters from
enjoying the benefits of their crimes. The court heard that while in 
jail, Adams filled in forms requiring him to declare his spending and 
assets.

But on his release detectives became suspicious after discovering he was
splashing money around and enjoying meals in expensive restaurants.
Adams admitted four charges of breaching a Financial Reporting Order.

His barrister Malcolm Swift QC said he is a ‘broken man’ and ‘completely
paranoid’ that he is being watched by undercover officers. ‘He doesn’t 
even drive a car or use the telephone because he is determined nothing 
should be misconstrued,’ he said.

Outside court Mrs Adams said: ‘Terry is severely dyslexic. ‘He did not fill out the forms, a solicitor did it for him. He is not what everyone thinks.’

A spokesman for the Serious Organised Crime Agency said: ‘Financial 
Reporting Orders are intended to be preventive rather than punitive 
measures to make  re-offending more difficult.’
