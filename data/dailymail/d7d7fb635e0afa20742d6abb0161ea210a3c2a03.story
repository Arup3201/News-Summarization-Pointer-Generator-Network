An actress who claimed to have uncovered startling new details about the murder of Princess Michael's 'toyboy' millionaire has been killed in a mysterious Moscow car crash before she could disclose them.

Mikhail Kravchenko, who shared a four-day break with the royal 
in a Venice hotel in 2006, was gunned to death in his Mercedes in May.

Marina Golub, an actress and close friend of Mr Kravchenko's, has now been killed in a Hyundai taxi, after apparently having been warned off for asking questions about his death.

Mysterious killing: Mikhail Kravchenko, who shared a four-day break with Princess Michael in Venice in 2006, was gunned to death in his Mercedes in May

The Princess was seen dining at Harry's Bar with the younger man, gazing into his eyes and stroking his cheek

Princess Michael, 67, was said to have been 'very distressed' when told of the murder of the 46-year-old Russian furniture tycoon, who was 21 years her junior.

The pictures of her gazing into his eyes and gently stroking his cheek in the romantic city caused great embarrassment for husband Prince Michael, the Queen's cousin.

They dined at Harry's Bar, took gondola rides and shopped in boutiques, after she had checking into the Cipriani under a fake name.

Many theories surfaced when Mr Kravchenko was murdered. Some claimed he  had been in dispute with Russia's 
powerful Interior Ministry shortly before his death, while others speculated that it could have been a case of mistaken identity. 

Friends in high places: The pictures of the millionaire and Princess in Italy are said to have caused great embarrassment for her husband, Prince Michael (centre with the pair in Moscow in 2006)

Secrets: Marina Golub, a well-known Russian actress, apparently contacted Mr Kravchenko's mother with urgent information on his murder

There are suspicions that his lucrative 
furniture stores were desired by a top business clan who decided Mr Kravchenko was dispensable. 

The Russian tycoon had apparently known for years that 
someone had wanted him dead, after surviving two bungled murder attempts 
as well as four arson attacks at his Moscow factory.

While police have made arrests over the 
tycoon's death, including an alleged mastermind named as Alexei Pronin, 
36, friends suspect a cover-up.

The wealthy businessman's mother Galina, 65, now claims 54-year-old actress Golub - a familiar TV face in Russia - had uncovered new information about her son's death and was about to reveal what she knew.

'She said, "I will come and tell you, I can't discuss it on phone",'  revealed a shocked Mrs Kravchenko.

Former Kravchenko aide Svetlana 
Savelyeva said her 'very close friend' Golub had told her three days 
before her death that she had been warned that 'she was digging too 
deeply into the circumstances of Mikhail's murder; and that she should 
take her nose out of it'.

Another friend, Roksolana Chernoba, added: 'It
is a horrible situation - it was Mikhail first, killers sprayed him 
with bullets. Then four months later she dies. It is a mystery.' 

Mrs Kravchenko added: 'She said somebody told her, "You're 
digging too deep, watch your back. It may end in a bad way, you better 
go quiet."'

'All of us, all who love him, all of us carry on trying to find out something about his death.'

Buried truth: Mr Kravchenko's murder sparked many theories, and sources claim the actress was warned off probing the case any further

Murder plot: The Russian tycoon had apparently known for years that someone had wanted him dead, after surviving two bungled attempts on his life

'Given modern technologies, I want to say that her death cannot be a coincidence.'

The actress died after she hailed a late-night taxi. The driver, who had a fake licence, was killed with her when a Cadillac jeep failed to stop at red lights and struck the Hyundai.

She was declared dead at the crash scene and the driver of the jeep sped off into the night at high speed.

He was named as Alexei Rusakov, 31, but has not been located despite repeated police appeals.
