AC Milan missed the chance to go third in the Serie A table after suffering a 2-0 home defeat to Palermo on Sunday evening.

The Rossoneri would have dislodged Sampdoria from the final Champions League place with three points at San Siro, but an early own goal from Christian Zapata set the tone for an under-par display.

Paulo Dybala scored the Sicilians' second goal, one that both assured promoted Palermo of a first away win of the season and lifted them six points clear of the relegation zone and into 13th place.

Sampdoria had earlier returned to the title race by edging out Fiorentina 3-1 in a frenetic clash at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris.

The opening 45 minutes witnessed three goals and a saved penalty as Samp battled to wrestle third place from Napoli, while Fiorentina appeared determined to escape from mid-table obscurity.

Angelo Palombo notched first for the hosts, from the spot, minutes before Fiorentina midfielder Gonzalo Rodriguez saw his penalty snaffled by Sergio Romero.

Luca Rizzo and Stefan Savic then exchanged goals just before the break, with Eder rubber-stamping the Blucerchiati's first league win in four attempts with a 78th-minute strike.

Genoa won a third straight game on Sunday with a 4-2 triumph at Udinese.

Each team scored twice in the opening half, but Alessandro Matri put the visitors in front for good in the 54th minute.

Udinese wasted several chances to equalise before substitute Juraj Kucka killed the game off three minutes from time with Genoa's fourth goal.

Torino fans will have to wait longer for their team to win two league games in a row as they were held to a goalless draw by Atalanta.

The Granata could have sealed all three points deep in stoppage time, but substitute midfielder Alexander Farnerud saw Atalanta goalkeeper Marco Sportiello deflect his shot over the crossbar.

Chievo halted a four-match losing streak with a stalemate at home to Sassuolo.

The visitors were the better side, but could not find a way past Chievo goalkeeper Albano Bizarri, who made three saves to earn his team a valuable point.
