A Nambour mother was dragged out of the family car and had her top teeth smashed in by a stranger who was enraged by slow service at a McDonald's drive thru - right in front of her children's eyes.

Leigh Barham was treating her two boys, aged four and eight, to Happy Meals on Australia Day 2011 when Troy Shane Kuskopf started his unprovoked attack on the family from his car.

Kuskopf, who was sentenced to two years' jail, was not present when the magistrate handed down his sentence at Maroochydore Magistrates Court on Friday.

After the verdict was handed down, Ms Barham told The Courier Mail the assault had left her so terrified she avoided fast food drive-thrus and was constantly locking her car doors.

A man has been jailed for attacking a woman while her children were in the car, because the drive-thru was taking too long at McDonalds

Ms Barham said the drive-thru was full and nobody was moving when Kuskopf got out of his car and started abusing the family, including the children's grandmother in the driver's seat, while they were placing their order.

The man spat on one of the car's windows and kicked a tyre before the family left the fast food chain.

The family made their way down Currie St - one of Nambour's main roads.

They had driven about 100m down the road when Ms Barham's son spotted Kuskopf behind them and yelled out: 'He's coming.'

Ms Barham's mother drove another 600m to the service station when they had to stop at a red light.

'We just didn't want to drive through it and hurt somebody else,' Mr Barham said.

'And he came up right behind us. I thought he was going to ram us, but he pulled up inside of us, just reefed my door open and pulled me out of the car, smashed me in the face a few times.

'My son was at the window and he punched my son’s window and just threw me on the ground.'

Leigh Barnham had to fork out over $3,000 for dental work following the brutal attack

After the attack, Ms Barham needed $3,000 worth of dental work, including a new plate in her upper jaw and false top teeth.

On Thursday, the court heard Ms Barham's children, who were aged four and eight at the time of the attack, experienced bet wetting and sleeping problems for months because they were so traumatised.

The pair spent a year obsessively checking the doors and windows while driving in the car.

Ms Barham, who was depressed and stressed, ended up quitting her job as a youth worker that she studied three years to get because she could not deal with the demands of working with troubled teenagers.

The family had to attend sessions with psychiatrists after the incident and Ms Barham is on anti-depressants.

Police prosecutor Sergeant Nick Nitschke appealed to the court to hand Kuskopf the toughest sentence because he had fled the scene, evaded police, failed to show at court and did not offer an early plea.

Magistrate Simon Young said the road rage attack was 'disturbing and serious'.

Condemning Kuskopf's actions, Magistrate Young said the man had shown no remorse for what he had done and had not even bothered to show up at court for his hearing or sentencing.

He ordered the 37-year-old's arrest who will be eligible for parole in eight months.

The man was also told to pay $1,000 in restitution to Ms Barham.
