The owner of the Nazi-themed Soldatenkaffee in Bandung, West Java, is being questioned by authorities over whether he is trying to incite racial hatred

A restaurant owner in Indonesia whose Nazi-themed cafe is covered with Hitler memorabilia and staffed by waiters in Waffen-SS military uniforms is to be questioned by authorities.

Soldatenkaffee in the West Java provincial capital of Bandung has sparked outrage amongst tourists and locals for its red wall of Nazi-related memorabilia, including a large flag with swastika and a giant picture of Adolf Hitler.

Despite being open since April 2011, a recent article about its German fascist theme in a local English-language newspaper has prompted angry criticisms on social networking sites.

Now the deputy mayor of the popular tourist town has written to cafe owner Henry Mulyana summoning him to discuss his motives for opening the cafe and whether his objective was to incite racial hatred.

Ayi Vivananda said: 'Those symbols are internationally recognized to represent violence and racism.'

Mr Mulyana says he simply intended to attract business to his restaurant, and denies wanting to breed hatred.

He also denied being pro-Nazi or supporting Hitler, responsible for the deaths of some 6 million Jews during World War II.

He said: 'I'm just a businessman, not a politician.

'I have a right to design my restaurant with anything that attracts people to come. I'm sure that I'm not violating any laws.'

He said the recent controversy had 
forced him to temporarily close his restaurant, but did not say whether 
he would consider changing the Nazi theme if authorities requested him 
to do so.

'Let's wait and see', he said.Â  'I don't want the workers here to lose their jobs.'

The walls of the cafe which opened in the popular tourist town in 2011 are covered in Nazi memorabilia
