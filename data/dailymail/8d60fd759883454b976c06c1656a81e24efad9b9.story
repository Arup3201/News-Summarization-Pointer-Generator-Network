US Paralympic hopeful Ranjit Steiner says he could have never imagined that someone would stoop so low as to steal his prosthetic leg. 

Steiner, from San Francisco, woke up Tuesday morning - his birthday - to discover that thieves had smashed the rear right window on his brand-new car and taken his laptop along with his $25,000 blade-style running leg.

Steiner, a track-and-field champion who aspires to go to the 2016 Paralympics in Brazil, uses it for competitive running at City College of San Francisco.

Survivor: Steiner had his right leg amputated four years ago after contracting bone cancer 

In a message posted on his Facebook page, Steiner wrote that the break-in took place sometime between 8pm Monday and 9am Tuesday along Cesar Chavez Street between Mission and Valencia streets.

As of noon Wednesday, Steiner’s artificial leg - a black model with a yellow stripe on either side - has not been found. The thieves also took the athlete’s backup running blade.

Champ: Steiner won the bronze medal in the nationals last year 

‘It's just so low,’ Steiner told NBC Bay Area. ‘You never think anybody would take something like that.’

Steiner, a graduate of University of Oregon with a degree in journalism, lost his right leg above the knee to bone cancer four years ago.

But the amputation did not stop him from competing or pursuing his Olympic dreams.

On Tuesday Morning, Steiner got behind the wheel of his brand-new Subaru Imperza and hit the road, only to feel the breeze on his back coming from the shattered back window, according to Palo Alto Online.

Steiner was hoping that the perpetrators had not found his prosthetic under the seat, but the expensive running blade was nowhere to be found.

Steiner says the artificial leg will not do the thieves any good because it was custom-fitted for his height and leg length, and can only be used for running.

The cancer survivor says he seldom leaves anything of value in the car, but on Monday night he went out with his family to celebrate his birthday and forgot the blade and his other possessions in the backseat.

Steiner, who won the bronze medal in the national championship last year, says he cannot do any high-level training without his blade.

Luckily for Steiner, he works for a company that manufactures prosthetic sockets and his employer is sponsoring him, but fitting him with a replacement could take up to a month.

The athlete is asking for the public's help in locating and returning the artificial leg to him so he could continue with his 100- and 200-meter sprint workouts.

‘I've got four months until National Championships and this... you know, every day counts at this point,’ Steiner told ABC 7 News.

An online fundraiser has now been launched on Life Indiegogo hoping to raise $30,000 to help Steiner get a new artificial leg.
