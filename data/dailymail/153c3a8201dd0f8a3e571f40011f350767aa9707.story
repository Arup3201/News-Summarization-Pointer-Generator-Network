A 24-year-old American man who fell into a coma after seizures has died in Liberia while his family fought to get him out of the country amid a border lockdown over the Ebola outbreak.

Nathaniel Dennis, 24, from Maryland, died on Wednesday morning at Aspen Medical in Sinkor, Liberia. He had been in a coma since July 24 after suffering seizures earlier this month while on vacation visiting family. 

Due to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, Mr Dennis was unable to be medically evacuated to a facility in Ghana which had the proper facilities to treat him - despite testing negative for the deadly disease.

The 24-year-old lay comatose and was unable to receive the life-saving treatment that he needed, including a respirator and kidney dialysis machine, which the medical center did not have.

Mr Dennis had been quarantined for three days after he fell ill at JFK Medical Center over fears he had the Ebola virus.

A few days later, the Liberian government closed most of the country's borders to try to stop the spread of Ebola.

The Dennis family hired a Medevac unit on July 27, in the hopes they could take him to Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Ghana but the country refused to grant clearance to land.

Doctors, with the help of the U.S. Embassy and the Ghanaian government, had tried to find a neurologist to assess the young man but were unable to do so in time.

On the family's GoFundMe page today, his sister Natasha Dennis wrote: 'This is a circumstance of timing, logistics, and unpreparedness by local governments.

'It could have been prevented. We don’t know what happened to him; besides lack of immediate treatment.'

In a family statement, it was reported that Mr Dennis had been born three months' premature and required a shunt to his brain.

A graduate of Howard
 High School in Maryland, he studied at Howard Community College. The 
24-year-old was an aspiring musician who had been working as a DJ at a 
Liberian radio station prior to his death.

On his Facebook page on July 22, the 'endlessly positive' young man had posted the words: 'What doesnt kill me makes me stronger.'

Family and friends had been fundraising to bring Nathaniel home but the money will now be put towards his burial.

The
 current outbreak of Ebola is the worst since the virus was discovered 
in 1976. The death toll  stands at 672, while more than 1,200 people 
have been infected.

Ebola has swept through Western Africa, having first been detected in Guinea in February.

Since then victims have succumbed to the incurable illness, which starts with flu-like symptoms before evolving to cause catastrophic internal bleeding, in Sierra Leone and Liberia.

But it was the death of a U.S. citizen in the Nigerian captial of Lagos on Friday, that has prompted fears the disease could be on the brink of spreading to the West, as experts warn it could be carried across international borders by air travellers.

Patrick Sawyer, a consultant for Liberia's Finance Ministry, died on Friday after arriving at Lagos airport on June 20, having vomited and suffered diarrhea on two flights.

The 40-year-old U.S. citizen had been to the funeral of his sister, who also died from the disease.

A woman quarantined at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Hong Kong has tested negative for the disease, despite returning from a trip to Kenya with Ebola-like symptoms.
