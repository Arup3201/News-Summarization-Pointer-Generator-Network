They may look like grandfather and granddaughter - but 29-year-old Nicola and 67-year-old Joe Philpot are actually husband and wife.

When they fell for each other, Nicola was just 16 years old and the romance caused a huge backlash from their families.

Joe, who is a grandfather, was even branded a paedophile by locals in their hometown of Chigwell, Essex.

Nicola and Joe have faced a great deal of opposition to their romance after meeting when Nicola was 16 and Joe was 54

The couple have been together for over 13 years and now have four children; (L-R) Kody (8), Felicity (12), Lilly Rose (11 months) and Thomas (10)

But the couple have always defended their unconventional relationship and now have proved their critics wrong as they plan to renew their wedding vows after celebrating their 13th anniversary.

They are proud parents to Felicity, 12, Cody, eight, Thomas 10, and Lilly-Rose - who was born just 11 months ago.

And the pair insists they still have an active sex life - despite the fact Joe suffers from angina and arthritis.

Nicola said: 'Even though Joe’s more than double my age, he’s so full of energy.

'He might have 10 teeth missing and a bit of a pot belly, but he’s absolutely gorgeous to me.'

When Nicola first started dating Joe, the uncle of a school friend, she had just turned 16 and he was a 54-year-old divorced father of three.

She said: 'I would often see him when I was doing my local paper round and when we chatted there was an instant attraction.

'He seemed fun and would play my favourite 60s’ music like the Bee Gees. I knew I wanted to be with Joe - it didn’t feel weird, it felt right.'

Despite the 38-year age gap, the feeling was mutual for retired plumber Joe and he made the first move.

Nicola says they have a perfect family package and if people have a problem with their age difference it is their problem

He said: ‘I felt if I didn’t say anything it might be something I regretted for the rest for my life.'

Just two weeks after admitting their feelings for each other, Nicola moved in to Joe’s house.

A year later, Nicola gave birth to Felicity and a year after that the couple were wed.

Nicola said: 'A lot of people didn’t agree with our relationship. When we first went out, people would call Joe names - like paedophile.

Joe says he doesn't feel his age and 'loves running around after the kids. I'm a hand's on dad and I love every minute of it'

'My family stopped talking to me and all but one of Joe’s children cut all ties with him. It caused a huge rift but I’d never been so happy in my life.

Joe, here with his fourth child, six month-old Lilly-Rose, has become estranged from many of his children from former partnerships, over the union

'It was upsetting that I didn’t have the support of my family but Joe and I thought we were just a normal couple in love and we wanted to be together no matter what.'

She added: 'Mum still doesn’t approve and I hardly speak with any of my family now.

'I don’t see what their problem is - if one of my daughters wanted to date an older man I wouldn’t stop her - I think older men treat women better.'

Today, full-time mother Nicola said she and Joe have the perfect family package.

She added: 'I’ve always wanted a family young and despite the age difference between Joe and me, I’ve never had trouble conceiving.

'We decided to try for another baby a couple of years ago and now have the perfect package.

'When we go to the shops, people often assume Joe’s the kids’ grandfather. But he doesn’t seem to mind and finds it all a bit funny.

'Joe’s a great dad and still has plenty of energy to play with them. He’s young for his age and I tend not to think about what will happen in the future. I live for every moment as it comes.

'I’m just as in love with Joe as the first day I met him-we now hope to save up money to renew our wedding vows very soon.'

Joe added: 'I don’t feel my age and love running around after the kids. I’m a hands-on dad and I love every minute of it.

'We’re just a normal family - we go to the park at weekends take the kids on camping holiday.

'If people disapprove of us it’s their problem, not mine.'
