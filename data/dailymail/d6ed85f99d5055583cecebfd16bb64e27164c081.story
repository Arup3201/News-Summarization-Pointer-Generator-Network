Harry Kane is expected to receive his first senior international call on Thursday and England's decision to train at Tottenham next week will present Roy Hodgson the chance to discuss future plans for the young striker with Mauricio Pochettino.

Hodgson has promised England Under 21 manager Gareth Southgate the first choice on the players he wants to select for the European Championships in the Czech Republic in June.  

Harry Kane is expected to be named in Roy Hodgson's England squad on Thursday

The Tottenham striker has made a huge impact in scoring 26 goals in his breakthrough season

After his 26-goal breakthrough season, 21-year-old Kane is at the top of Southgate's list but Spurs boss Pochettino would prefer him to rest after the club's post-season tour to Australia. 

'Tottenham, the FA and Harry Kane all need to share our opinions and take the best decision,' said Pochettino. 'All players want to play for their country, but we need to speak because we care about Harry and want him to develop in the best way.'

Both Hodgson and Pochettino are scheduled to be at the Spurs training base, near Enfield, next Thursday as England prepare for a Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley and a friendly in Italy on Monday week.

Southgate will not be present but discussions are already open about Kane's availability for the U21 Euros, with an idea forming that he could be given a short break after his return from Australia and before reporting late to the England camp to ease Tottenham's concerns about burnout.

Those selected by Southgate for the tournament – England's first game is on June 18 - will be excused games with Hodgson's senior team in June against the Republic of Ireland and Slovenia. 

Kane's value to his club and country are illustrated by the remarkable statistics he has generated this term (see graphic).

His 26 goals have been vital in Spurs' push for Champions League football, but among those strikes are five that have been equalisers and seven that have put his side ahead.

His conversion rate for headed shots at goal is 27 per cent, a Premier League high.

And, perhaps most tellingly, Spurs have won just won game out of six when Kane has not played.
