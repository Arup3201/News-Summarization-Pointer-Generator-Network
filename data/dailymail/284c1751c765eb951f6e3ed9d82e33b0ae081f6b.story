The Queen will tour France in an old Renault during her state visit next week because none of Francois Hollande's Citroens have the space to fit her large hats, it has been reported.

The French president has personally invited Her Majesty to Normandy to help him commemorate the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings on June 6.

But heads have been spinning at the Elysee Palace ever since the announcement after staff realised she would not be able to sit upright in either the pokey presidential Citroen DS5 or the larger C6 model if she wears any one of her large hats.

Old friends: Queen Elizabeth II last met President Hollande in 2012 when he paid a visit to Windsor Castle

Their first option was a C6 Citroën limousine, rolled out primarily for dignitaries on ceremonial occasions, but its low roof line would not have accommodated Elizabeth II's lavish headgear, The Times reported. Then there was the DS5, but that, they found, had the same problem.

Their only other choice was one of the large people carriers used to ferry Elysee staff and security, but that was quickly dismissed, deemed unfit for royalty, said the newspaper.

So after much toing and froing, Hollande decided it best to wheel out his old Renault Vel Satis, which - at 62.2 inches - stands 2.6 inches taller than the 'compact executive' DS5.

However, the expensive Vel Satis 
was a commercial failure for Renault a decade ago and production was 
halted in 2009 after seven years. The model provided for the Queen is an armoured 3.5-litre V6.

Too small: Staff at Elysee Palace's first option was a C6 Citroën limousine, used primarily on ceremonial occasions, but its low roof line would not have accommodated Elizabeth II's lavish headgear either

President Hollande first rode out in his new Citroen DS5 for his inauguration in 2012 in which he got drenched on an embarrassing open-topped drive up the Champs Elysee.

He chose the DS5 in display of modesty as he attempted to contrast himself from predecessor Nicholas Sarkozy's lavish image.

On their visit, beginning next Thursday, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, who will be aged 88 and 92 respectively at the time, will undertake a series of engagements to mark the British war effort before travelling on to Paris where they will be formally received by President Hollande at the Elysee Palace.

It is her first visit to France since she made the same trip to meet president Jacques Chirac ten years ago.

Long time coming: The last time the Queen visited France was in 2004 with then-president Jacques Chirac

After Friday’s ceremonies by the Normandy beaches, with the Prince of Wales and much of the senior royal family, the Queen will return to a state banquet at the Elysée.

She will be presented with an album of photographs from her first two French visits, an official trip in 1948 as Princess Elizabeth and a state visit with the Duke of Edinburgh nine years later.

Hollande is so keen to impress 'La Reine d’Angleterre', as she is always known, that he has ordered fois gras to be at the top of the menu because he knows it is a royal favourite, claimed The Times.

The royal couple will then tuck in to a main course of lamb with small vegetables and a Bordeaux wine, followed by a cheese platter of reblochon, a pungent specialty of the Alpine region of France.
