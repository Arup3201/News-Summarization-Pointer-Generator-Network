A boat carrying around 150 suspected asylum seekers has capsized off northwest Australia today, just a week after 90 people drowned on a similar journey.

Merchant ships are currently collecting survivors from the capsizing, which happened between Indonesia and Australia's Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean.

Dozens of asylum seekers are feared drowned after a second boatload of capsized in less than a week in Australian waters today.

The frail wooden boat was estimated to have been carrying about 150 people and there were fears that many had drowned as rescuers were making their way to the scene of the tragedy.

Just last Thursday at least 90 asylum seekers drowned when their boat, also heading for Christmas Island, capsized resulting in furious debate breaking out in Australia about the influx of asylum seekers.

On hearing of today's tragedy, which mirrors the circumstances of last week's disaster, politicians blamed one another's parties for refugee policies that failed to prevent incidents like these from occurring.

It is understood that the boat involved in today's tragedy was carrying Afghans who had fled their country and had used Indonesia as a staging post on their way to Australia, where they hoped to obtain political asylum.

Christmas Island is the first stop in Australian waters on the dangerous sea journey from Indonesia.

As rescue boats headed towards the scene, Labour MP Graham Perrett joined in the growing controversy today when he tweeted: '150 people in the water RIGHT NOW. That's one for every single elected free-thinking Member of the House of Representatives.'

Mr Mal Larsen, from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said rescue ships were beginning to arrive at the scene and some people were being pulled from the water.

'They are doing their best to pull people out,' he said. 'It's too early to say how many have been saved.'

Unlike last week's tragedy, when many of the estimated 200 people on board were able to cling to the upturned hull of their capsized boat, the vessel involved in today's incident had completely sunk, said officials of Australia's Customs and Border Protection.

The capsize has occurred some 105 miles north of Christmas Island about 100 miles south of Indonesia.

'Initial reports are that up to 150 people may be on board,' said the Border Patrol Command. 'Two merchant vessels are currently on the scene.

'Border Protection Command has also deployed its vessels and aircraft to assist with the operation.'

The waters between Indonesia and Christmas Island are a popular route for asylum seekers, who transit through Indonesia with the help of people smugglers in often overcrowded boats.

So far this year, more than 50 boats carrying more than 4,000 asylum seekers have been detected by Australian authorities.

The trip is often dangerous. In December 2011, as many as 200 died when an overcrowded boat sank off the coast of East Java. In 2010, 50 asylum seekers died when their boat was thrown onto rocks at Christmas Island.

In 2001, a crowded boat known as the SIEV X sank on its way to Australia with the loss of 350 lives.
