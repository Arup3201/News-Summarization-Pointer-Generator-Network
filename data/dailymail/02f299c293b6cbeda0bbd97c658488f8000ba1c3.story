St Helens prop Joe Greenwood has signed a three-year contract extension that will keep him at Langtree Park until the end of 2017.

The 21-year-old former Saddleworth Rangers player has made 29 appearances for Saints since making his debut in 2012.

'This is great news for both the club and Joe,' coach Nathan Brown said.

Staying put: St Helens prop Joe Greenwood has signed a three-year contract extension at the club

'He is a one of a host of younger players who have had a reasonable amount of experience over the past few years and have done well.

'He has a bright future and the more experience he gains and the more he keeps on improving in key areas then the closer he will be to becoming a permanent fixture in the team.'

Saints have also given a three-year contract to 19-year-old academy player Jack Ashworth.
