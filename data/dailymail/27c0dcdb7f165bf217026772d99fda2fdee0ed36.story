PCSO Jonathan Hall has come under fire for comparing parents on the school run to 'wailing, hissing feral cats

Ambitious parents might think their educational problems are over when they secure a coveted place at a sought-after school.

But it turns out that bagging a parking spot near the school gates can be every bit as competitive.

According to one community policeman the fight for a space makes some parents harder to deal with than ‘wailing, hissing feral cats’.

Jonathan Hall says they indulge in a ‘vicious game of cat and mouse’ as they try to avoid a parking ticket – even at the cost of blocking driveways.

In desperation, the police community support officer used an official email to beg school-run drivers to behave themselves in Littleport, Cambridgeshire.

Mr Hall, a former RSPCA inspector, wrote: ‘When challenged, the parent will become an angry creature, wailing and hissing their annoyance at being challenged over their dangerous parking.

‘The parent stares out from their metal box, with a look of pure hate. A look upon their face saying, “I would splat you with one swipe of my paw (if it was not illegal)”. Never mind the moggies, it is the mothers who bare their claws these days.’

Mr Hall reminded parents that officers patrolled near schools to prevent accidents and said parking on double yellow lines was likely to result in a ticket.

It is not known which school he was referring to but residents confirmed his beat covers Littleport community primary school.

One woman, who has an 11-year-old daughter at the school and lives along the same road, said Mr Hall’s remarks were justified. 

She added: ‘This road is completely chaotic. Everyone is trying to park down roads with no parking spaces. I can’t even park outside my own house.

‘We’ve had countless texts from the headmaster reminding people to park appropriately. But parents just ignore it.

‘I know there’s bickering and fighting going on between the women – it’s all very unsafe. They are so focused on getting a space they stop watching the kids and I think one day a child will be hit.’

Elizabeth Poglia, 70, a retired college lecturer who lives by the school, said: ‘It’s all these well-to-do mothers in their posh white Mercedes who are doing it. 

'They have these huge great cars they don’t need and their attitude is “So what? I’m only here for two minutes”. 

He wrote on an online messaging forum saying that catching parents parking illegally outside some schools was like a game of 'cat and mouse'

‘They’re very slick and clever and they’re very self-assured. They are stealthy and will do anything to avoid getting a ticket.

‘They know they’re being inconsiderate but they think they are superior. The ones that go to work are always in a hurry and always pushy.’ Another resident, 31-year-old Emilia Zohahlwicz, said: ‘There is a lot of aggression from the mums. They fight for spaces and I think what the PSCO said is truthful.’

Ed Morrow, campaigns officer for Brake, the road safety charity, said illegal parking around schools presented a serious danger to children who can emerge from between stationary cars.

He added: ‘We would urge all parents to be part of the solution, not part of the problem, by considering how their children can get to school other than by car, or if they have to drive, then by sticking to 20mph or below wherever there may be vulnerable people on foot or bike.’

A near-miss accident last March involving a child at a Littleport school prompted police to target parents who park dangerously.

Miriam Farrell, 37, whose sons attend Littleport community primary, said: ‘The response is perhaps a bit over the top but there is certainly a problem with space.

‘There’s just not enough places for people to park and so people park illegally and compete for spaces.’

Other parents said the parking problem was made worse by schools being overcrowded.

The PCSO (not pictured) said when parents are challenged they become 'an angry creature, wailing and hissing their annoyance'

'When I worked for the RSPCA one of the most frequently asked questions I was asked was, 'What is the most dangerous animals you have had to deal with ' A Fox ! A Badger, A Bull, A Horse !. When I told them it was with out a doubt a cat, they would look very disappointed. A cat, what one of those cute, cuddly, purring softies ?? 

'But if the situation is right !! I would then tell them of my personal experiences of trying to catch an injured cat, usually a feral one and how crazy they would react. A Feral cat would climb a wall, run along the ceiling (almost), screaming and wailing like the most terrifying creature from a horror movie. It would take me all my strength and cunning to get hold of the ferocious Feline on the end of my Grasper, and place it into a pet carrier. 

'All I wanted was to get the injured animal to a vet to have its paw seen too. The captured mog would stare out of its cage, with a look of pure hate, thinking to itself if I was bigger I would splat you with one swipe of my paw. Vets certainly earn their money.

'These days I no longer deal with such incidents. Or so I thought. Now take a parent, they are normally cute,purring, very pleasant, easy going, they might even engage in a little chat. But if the situation is right !! such as The School Run !!!! 

'A game of cat and mouse unfolds, the parent ( not all ) will pretend they have not seen you, as they park their car on double yellow lines, once parked the charade will continue, even if you stand next to the car, hoping your presence will resolve the situation. 

'When challenged, the Parent will be become an angry creature, wailing and hissing their annoyance at being challenged over their dangerous parking. It will take me all my strength to remain calm, as the Parent stares out from their metal box, with a look of pure hate. A look upon their face saying, I would splat you with one swipe of my paw ! ( if it was not illegal)

'Never mind the Moggies, it is the Mothers who bare their claws these days.

'I read a article in a paper recently where a mother had been knocked down by another parent, outside a school, and was in a serious situation in hospital. Some of you may have seen it yourself. It was a rather sobering read, and goes to show how things can go very wrong, over such a simple day to day event. 

'When your local Pcso is at your school, please remember we are there to prevent accidents. Accidents that might involve a child, ( or parent ) and no one wants that. If you can walk, please do. If you have to drive, and I know many of you do, please allow time to get to your school and park safely. If you should park on a yellow line, and get a ticket, please don't climb the wall ! the lines are there for safety reasons, nothing else.

'I do not have a Grasper these days, only a ticket book. And if there is no illegal parking, it stays in my pocket. And that gives us all a good Feline.'
