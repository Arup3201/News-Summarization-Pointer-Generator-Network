If anyone deserved a kiss last night, it was Germany's World Cup wizard Mario Gotze ... and fortunately for him, his lingerie model girlfriend was in place to pucker up.

Ann-Kathrin Brommel was first on the pitch to congratulate the 22-year-old hero behind the 113th-minute goal that saw his nation lift the World Cup for a fourth time in 60 years.

The 24-year-old beauty raced over the touchline after the final whistle blew and threw her arms around the national hero's neck and gazed deeply into her eyes before kissing him passionately on the lips.

Few of us will ever know what is like to be a national hero, adored the length of breadth of their home country and assured a place in history. But Mario Gotze most assuredly will.

Man of the 
match Gotze said: ‘It’s unbelievable. I scored but I didn’t really know 
what was happening. ‘A dream has become a reality and we are going to 
have a great party. It is absolutely sensational.

‘It wasn’t a simple tournament for me. I owe a lot to my friends and family.’

But who is the young German superstar, who has now half-volleyed his way into the annals of global footballing history?

He was born in the town of Memmingen, Bavaria. His father Jurgen Gotze, was a professor at the Dortmund University of Technology. His girlfriend is the glamorous German lingerie model Ann-Kathrin Brommel.

Indeed, Brommel, 24, and Gotze's relationship was first made public by the two in very revealing pictures taken on a yacht in Ibiza in late 2012.

Having been together for the past two years, Brommel has told Germany's GQ magazine that she is still enjoying simply being Gotze's girlfriend and has no desire for anything more serious at the moment.

'Someone whose purpose in life it is to be the wife of someone I cannot understand,' said Brommel in September.

'Although
 I am also the girlfriend of Mario Gotze, but I have my own personal 
goals I want to achieve. Otherwise I could not be more happy.'

Some of these life goals include her part-time pursuit of a musical career.

The model, under the stage name of Trina B, has released two songs: 'This is Me', in 2010 and 'Body Language' in 2011.

She has also revealed that she is a huge fan of Beyoncé Knowles and the work-life balance the American has achieved.

'Music is just a hobby of mine. I sing because I enjoy it. And not because I have a voice like Beyoncé,' said Brommel in the same interview.

The beauty is also an avid reader and counts the Harry Potter series and tear-jerker, Fault in Our Stars as some of her favorite reads.

Biggest fan: Brommel has followed her boyfriend and his German team-mates across Brazil over the past month and is seen here watching his team's narrow 2-2 draw with Ghana in Jun

Beginning modelling at the age of 16, Brommel hails from Emmerich in the northwest of Germany and is surely set to step into the big-time now that her boyfriend has achieved lasting international fame.

Gotze played for Borussia Dortmund between 2009 and 2013, winning the Bundesliga title in 2010-11, and was a member of the team which reached the 2013 Champions League Final.

In April 2013, the committed Christian moved to Bayern Munich for £29million, making him the second-most expensive German player, behind Mesut Ozil, who moved to Arsenal for a club-record fee of £42.5 million. Gotze earns an estimated £5.5m at the club.

The moment that will echo through eternity: The moment he put the ball past Argentinian keeper Romero to secure the victory

Former German Football Association's technical director Matthias Sammer describes Gotze as: 'One of the best talents that [Germany's] ever had.'

He played in his first match for Germany against Sweden, on November 17, 2010, coming on in the 78th minute in a goalless draw, making him the youngest German international since Uwe Seeler.

Interestingly, Gotze, along with André Schürrle who ran onto the pitch at the same time, is the first German players to be born in a reunified Germany.

His first goal for Germany was against Brazil on August 10, 2011 and he made his tournament debut in Euro 2012 after coming on as a substitute against Greece.

Football fans across the globe will have first taken note of this rising talent after the opening match against Portugal, winning the penalty kick for Germany's opening goal on his World Cup debut. Germany eventually won 4-0.

At just 22, it appears this new footballing light will only continue to shine even brighter.
