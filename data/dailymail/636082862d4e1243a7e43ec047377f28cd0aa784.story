When she was robbed of £10,000 worth of jewels, Loretta Smith was left traumatised.

But in an extraordinary act of forgiveness the 75-year-old victim has sent one of the burglars £20 to help him turn his life around.

The generous act came after career criminal Kevin Derbyshire wrote her a letter apologising for his crime.

Loretta Smith said she hoped that by giving the burglar the money, it would help 'bring him to his senses'

The pensioner wrote back to the 24-year-old, accepting his apology – and enclosed a £20 postal order. She explained: ‘He just said he was very, very sorry.

‘His writing was appalling [with] really bad spelling. He said he was really sorry for what had happened and he had been under the influence of valium.’

She continued: ‘I felt sorry for him. He obviously wasn’t very bright. I answered his letter and said thank you for your letter and that I hoped he understood the trauma he’d caused me.’

It appears Derbyshire’s partner in crime had also realised the trouble the pair had caused by their actions.

During the raid on Mrs Smith’s home last August Derbyshire and Graham Llewellyn, also 24, grabbed £10,000 worth of gems including several rings and watches.

But after CCTV pictures of them committing the burglary where broadcast, Llewellyn bundled some of the stolen property into a black bin bag and left it outside Mrs Smith’s home. The release of the CCTV pictures led to their arrest.

Llewellyn has also written to Mrs Smith – but has so far not had a response.

Speaking about her letter to Derbyshire, Mrs Smith said: ‘I made it very short and sweet, thanking him for the letter and said I was sure that he had not only upset me. He must have upset his partner or wife both financially and emotionally.

‘I thought at first I’d send him some stamps so he could send letters to loved ones – but I sent him £20.’

After he was arrested for burgling Mrs Smith’s home, a repentant Derbyshire wrote to his victim. Here is his letter (with spelling mistakes corrected)

To the victims of my really horrible crime that I’ve committed, I just want to say that I’m really sorry for my stupid actions.

I can assure you that I’m not a bad person, and I do not do things like this.

I feel really bad, and I know I should.

Things like this shouldn’t happen at all, and I didn’t even know what I was doing at the time.

It was only when I went on Facebook and read all the horrible messages about me that it clicked what I had done.

After the 75-year-old replied, sending him £20, he wrote back:

Dear Mr and Mrs Smith,

I just wanted to say thank you ever so much for your kindness towards me and replying to my letter.

I really can’t say how much that letter meant to me in words, but I can assure you that it made me feel a lot better. Thank you so much for taking your spare time out of your way to write back to me.

And if there’s anything I can do for you when I am released, I will not hesitate to do unpaid work and also, when I’m released, I will drop you a bunch of flowers and a bottle of good wine. I am so sorry for my silly actions.

Her gift came despite Derbyshire and his accomplice leaving Mrs Smith with a £500 bill to repair the broken window at her home in Bolton and several stolen items not being returned.

Mrs Smith added: ‘If people think I’m silly then hey ho.’

‘I thought his letter came from the heart but maybe I’m just gullible. I’m hoping it will bring him to his senses and make him realise he has to go out and work.’

She added: ‘He did say when he comes out of prison he is going to buy me a bunch of flowers and the best bottle of wine he can afford.’

Details of Derbyshire’s written apology emerged at court, where the two men were jailed for 32 months each after admitting burglary.

In Bolton Crown Court Derbyshire’s lawyer Nicholas Ross said his client was ‘remorseful’ and said of Mrs Smith’s gift: ‘It was out of remarkable sympathy, and I might say, in an almost saintly way, a token of her generosity.’
