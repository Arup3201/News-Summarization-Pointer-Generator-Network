Corruption: The charges relate to offences originating from an HBOS branch in Reading, Berkshire

Eight people are facing corruption charges in connection with around £35million worth of business loans made through a High Street bank.

Former senior manager at HBOS Lynden Scourfield and his wife Jacqueline, both 50, are among those charged, as is Mark Dobson, 52, also a one-time senior manager at the bank.

Also charged as part of the same alleged conspiracy to corrupt are David Mills, 56, and Michael Bancroft, 69, of Quayside Corporate Services, a turnaround consultancy, the Crown Prosecution Service said.

Lynden Scourfield, 50, and Mark Dobson, 52, both former senior managers at HBOS, were among those charged, the Crown Prosecution Service said tonight.

Thames Valley Police said the charges follow a large-scale investigation into corruption and other offences originating from the Halifax Bank of Scotland branch in Reading, Berkshire.

It follows an investigation carried out by the force’s Economic Crime Unit (ECU), after the case was referred to the force by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) because the alleged offences originated from HBOS’s Impaired Assets team based at Reading.

Mills, of Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, Bancroft, of Shipston-on-Stour, Warwickshire, and Scourfield, of Greenford, Middlesex, have each been charged with one count of conspiracy to corrupt, three counts of fraudulent trading and one count of money laundering, police said.

Dobson, from London, has been charged with one count of conspiracy to corrupt, while a fifth man, John Cartwright, 68, of Hyde, Cheshire, has been charged with one count of fraudulent trading. 

Allegations: David Mills, founder of Quayside Corporate Services, is among eight people facing charges

The other defendants are three of the men’s wives, Mrs Scourfield, 50, Alison Mills, 47, and Beverley Bancroft, 64.

The three women have each been charged with one count of money laundering, police said.

Sue Patten, head of fraud at the CPS, said: 'Following a thorough fraud and corruption investigation by Thames Valley Police, we have today authorised eight people to be charged in connection to business loans made through a high street bank to a value of around £35 million.

'Two former employees of HBOS, Lynden Scourfield and Mark Dobson, senior managers in Reading and Bishopsgate, have been charged with conspiracy to corrupt, contrary to the Criminal Law Act 1977.

'Also charged as part of the same conspiracy to corrupt are David Mills and Michael Bancroft of Quayside Corporate Services (QCS), a turnaround consultancy.'

All eight defendants are due to appear at Reading Magistrates’ Court on January 18.

Charges: The five men and three women are due to appear before magistrates in Reading later this month
