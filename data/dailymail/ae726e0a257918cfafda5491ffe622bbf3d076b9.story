A Charlotte mother has been charged in the death of her 7-month-old son despite the grandmotherâ€™s insistence that it was actually an older brother who killed the infant.

Nevetheless, Johnson made her initial appearance in court on charges of child abuse and inflicting serious bodily injury.

An autopsy revealed the baby suffered a 'subgaleal hemorrhage and hemorrhagic to the right eye, injuries to both cheeks, forehead, nose, back of the head, lip, and has a torn frenulum.'

After the court hearing, Johnson's mother, Debra Johnson Sanders told WCNC, said her grandson confessed to police that he dropped Camden on his head three times on purpose, then put Kamdyn back is his crib and poured water on him to try to wake him up.

Sanders admitted Johnson made a 'poor judgment' but said she was devastated by the incident and angry and hurt her daughter has been charged in the case.

Babysitting: Johnson's mother Debra Sanders, right, said her daughter had left the baby in the care of her 11-year-old son, left, when the infant was killed

Killed: The seven-month-old boy died after apparently being dropped on his head by his 11-year-old brother. Their mother was home at the time of the accident

Sanders says she was with police as they listened to the boy's confession. She says the boy was jealous of the attention Kamdyn received as an infant.

She also says her daughter's mistake was leaving Kamdyn alone for 45 minutes with the older son while she ran an errand, but Johnson is not a child abuser or child killer.

The family isn't saying if the 11-year-old is in juvenile custody, and neither are police.
