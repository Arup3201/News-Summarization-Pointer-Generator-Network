They are the modern, gleaming symbols of London and they are among the most iconic places in the world.

And now Covent Garden, Piccadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square and other famous capital locations can now been seen in a unique light through computer-generated photographs which juxtapose how they look today with historical views of the same spots.

The incredible images, from the Museum of London's collection, give a tantalising glimpse into events from decades past and, although showing just how much life in the city has changed, most of the landmarks are easily recognisable.

Back to the future: Piccadilly Circus in 1927 juxtaposed with how it looks today. The image is part of a stunning series of pictures from the Museum of London's collection which give a unique glimpse into the city's past

Past and present: An anti-union protester is marched away in Trafalgar Square in 1962, while the same fate befell suffragette Emily Pankhurst, who failed in her attempt to hand a petition to the King at Buckingham Palace

Devastation: The Royal Exchange in Bank as seen after a bomb was dropped 1941 and as it looks today

Historical: Back in the days when the River Thames used to freeze, in the 17th-century, as people and animals slide around on the ice

Piccadilly Circus has changed little since 1953, where a soldier is seen getting his shoes polished, while Pattiserie Valerie is pictured in Soho in 1926 and remains at the exact same spot today.

There are pictures of anti-union protests in Trafalgar Square in 1962, while Bank Station is shown after a bomb was dropped nearby in 1941.

Life: Ladies sell flowers at Covent Garden in 1877, left, and the Hippodrome in Leicester Square is a hive of activity in 1930, when it was one of the capital's major venues

Trade: Sugar being hoisted into warehouses at West India Docks, east London in 1900. Now, the buildings of Canary Wharf gleam in the background in an area which has seen enormous change

Transport: The clothes and vehicles are different but the station is exactly the same at Piccadilly Circus as a soldier gets his shoes polished there in 1953
