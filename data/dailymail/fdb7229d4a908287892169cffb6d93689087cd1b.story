He was just trying to watch the game, but instead he was dragged into a random couple's relationship drama.

A man named 'Lye' has written about his experiences confronting a stranger at a Detroit Lions football game, after he claims he saw the man's very pregnant girlfriend 'romantically texting' another man throughout the match.

At the end of the game, Lye handed the man a note revealing the alleged adulterous text messages, and later posted a picture of the note and the pair he claimed to be the couple to Facebook. 

Those images have since gone viral and are now sparking a heated debate online about whether it's appropriate to wade into a complete stranger's relationship.

Drama: A man named Lye took this picture of a pregnant woman who he alleges was texting a man named 'Jason' while seated next to another man who appeared to be her boyfriend at a recent Detroit Lions game. Lye decided to intervene and hand this note (right) to the fellow spectator

According to Lye's post on Facebook, he was attending a Detroit Lions game last month when he was seated behind a couple who appeared to be dating. 

Throughout the game, he claims he saw the woman casually texting a contact in her phone named 'Jason' apparently making comments like 'I wish I was with you all day' and 'I will see you as soon as I am done with him'.

Meanwhile,he claims the woman kept the phone screen tilted out of eyesight of the man seated next to her, and would even shut it off and put it away when he engaged her in conversation.

Feeling sympathetic for the man seated in front of him, who he believes was being cheated on, Lye got up near the end of the game to find a pen and piece of paper to write the stranger a note. 

When the man got up to leave, Lye handed the piece of paper to him and said to read it when he got home. 

Lye later took to Facebook to post an image of the note and the woman who was was seated in front of him, showing the back of her head with her phone out, writing a text. 

No regrets: The photo of the woman and the note has since gone viral online, after Lye (left) wrote about the experience on Facebook (right). Some have criticized him for interjecting himself into a stranger's relation or for putting the woman at risk for physical abuse. But Lye says he would make the same decision again

The pictures have since gone viral online and many have called Lye out for interjecting himself into the stranger's relationship. 

Lye has since defended his actions to Mad World News, saying he usually likes to stay out of other people's business, but overheard a few rude comments the woman made to the man she was with that made him pity her partner. 

He says at one point in the game, another spectator commented on the size of a portion of fries saying: 'Wow! For the price they charge for fries here, that's pretty small. They barely give you anything.'

The woman in question allegedly quipped back: 'It's okay, I'm [used] to small things'. 

Others criticized Lye for possibly putting the pregnant woman in harms way, pointing out that her boyfriend could have been abusive. 

'I doubt any woman who fears getting beat by her husband will speak that way and degrade him like she did or spend over 20 minutes texting the next man RIGHT BESIDE her "abusive" man,' Lye responded. 

Others argued the man could have been a brother or a friend, but Lye said that his judgement of the situation was that they were a couple and that the man even seemed suspicious of her texting, as he 'kept trying to look at her phone from the corner of his eyes'.

Despite the backlash, Lye says he would make the same decision again. 

'I don’t regret a damn thing, well except the fact that I didn’t leave anything for him to be able to contact me on.'
