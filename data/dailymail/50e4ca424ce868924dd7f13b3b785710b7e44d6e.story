From kittens for sale to handymen for hire, the majority of ads posted in newsagents' windows are practical ones. 

But for one lonely heart, it proved the perfect alternative to internet dating after a man, known only as John, used it to advertise for someone special.

In the post, which has gone viral after being photographed and put online, the man sets out his requirements and offers 'a way of life with quality'. 

'John' who is reportedly a builder posted this advert in his local newsagents, it has since gone viral after it was spotted by a passer by

John posted his advert, which is written in capital letters in black pen, in the window of his local newsagents in Muswell Hill.

It reads: 'John looking for a companion an apprentice / worker / lover for a craft that will change your life and bring you a way of life with quality.

It then details a phone number and says: 'Contact... Or call me for interview must be female between 30yrs - 40yrs.' 

Unfortunately for prospective lovers, John did not specify precisely what the 'craft' referred to was.

The lonely heart, which was posted last week, has now gone viral after it was spotted by an eagle-eyed passer by.

The anonymous Londoner then posted a picture of the ad on a Facebook account dedicated to London life where it went viral.

One user on the Facebook group jokingly commented: 'I seem to remember this is how that film Saw starts?'
