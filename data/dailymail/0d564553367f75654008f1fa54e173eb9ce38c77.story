The former flame of the suspected Boston Marathon bombing suspect says that she was so attracted to him when she saw him outside that she immediately went over and flirted.

'I met him standing outside a building and honestly, his face was enough to capture my heart. I walked right up to him and I was like, 'Oh my God, you are adorable. Can we hang out?' I'm very forward,' the girl told Mother Jones.

The girl, who is a fellow UMASS-Dartmouth student that is not releasing her name, started a romantic relationship with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev last fall that only lasted about two weeks.

Friends in low places: Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov (left and center) were identified as the two friends of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (right) who have been held in Boston jail since April 20

The American: Robel Phillipos, who was identified as this student by CNN, was arrested on Wednesday and charged with making false statements to police and obstructing justice in a terrorism investigation

During that time, she also met his three friends who were arrested on Wednesday for destroying evidence and lying to federal investigators.

The girl said that they all looked up to Tsarnaev, whom they referred to as 'Jahar'.

'They all sort of idolized Jahar,' she said.

Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov, both Kazakh nationals, were charged with conspiring to obstruct justice by destroying evidence. An American named Robel Phillipos is charged with knowingly and willfully making false statements to investigators.

She said that she met the three other young men through Tsarnaev, though she described him as being the 'leader of his group'.

She said that she was shocked by Tsarnaev's involvement in the bombing, as well as any help that he received from his friends.

'There was no indication that they were crazy at all. They just seemed goofy, kind of lackadaisical, not interested in their studies. But, you know, whatever, it was their first semester of college. No one really cared about books,' she said.

Tsarnaev and the unidentified young woman spent their time together involved listening to music and smoking pot, though she says she ended things when he wanted to move faster than she did though she doesn't consider that as an indication that he was bound to be a killer.

College friends: The first reports claim that the three people in custody all went to college with Dzhokhar at UMass Dartmouth and were thought to have helped him cover up for the bombings after the fact

'I don't think that's necessarily being a terrorist. I think that's just called being a hands-y teenaged boy,' she said.

She told Mother Jones that she was surprised by implications that the bombing had anything to do with Tsarnaev's religious beliefs as he never mentioned his religion during their time together.

She said that Dias Kadyrbayev, who seemed the closest to Tsarnaev, was more conservative as he once made a comment to her at a party about her dress being too revealing.

After Tsarnaev, Kadyrbayev appears to be the most in-command of the group as he was the one who texted

Kadyrbayev warned his friend that that he was plastered across television news outlets

'Tsarnaev’s return texts contained ‘lol’ and other things Kadyrbayev interpreted as jokes,' documents say.

On the same day that the FBI released pictures and video clips of the Tsarnaev brothers at the bomb scene, Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov removed items from the younger bomber's dorm room.

That was just two days before the FBI searched the room.

The criminal complaint lists that they removed Dzhokhar's backpack from his room and 'agreed to get rid of it after concluding from news reports that Tsarnaev was one of the Boston Marathon bombers.'

The three friends- Kadyrbayev, Tazhayakov and Phillipos- went over to Tsarnaev's on-campus dormitory after seeing the news reports.

Close: Azamat Tazhayakov, seen here with bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in an undated picture, told police that about a month before the Marathon attack, Dzhokhar said that he knew how to make a bomb

Texts: When the group arrived at the dorm, Dias 
Kadyrbayev (left) showed Tazhayakov (right) a text from the bomber that 
said 'I'm about to leave if you need something in my room take it'

Happier times: Kadyrbayev told investigators that he suggested they take Tsarnaev's backpack and his laptop from the room, and later was the one to throw it in the garbage at his off-campus apartment

When the group arrived at the dorm, Kadyrbayev showed Tazhayakov a text from the bomber that said 'I'm about to leave if you need something in my room take it.'

He did not specify where he was going, but Tazhayakov told investigators that he felt that this meant he would never see Tsarnaev alive again.

Kadyrbayev 'knew when he saw the empty fireworks that Tsarnaev was involved in the Marathon bombing.

Tazhayakov was more alarmed because the tubes had been emptied but not destroyed, meaning that Tsarnaev could have either used the explosives or planned to use them.

Kadyrbayev found Vaseline in the room, which he told the others Tsarnaev used to make bombs.

First suspects: Brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev were identified as the first suspects

Alarm bells: The friends said that they became concerned that Tsarnaev actually had something to do with the bombings when they found these empty firework containers in his dorm room 

At one point in the police interviews, Tazhayakev said that during a meal a month before the attack, Tsarnaev told he and Kadyrbayev that he knew how to make a bomb.

Kadyrbayev was reportedly the one who 'decided to remove the backpack from the room in order to help his friend Tsarnaev avoid trouble.'

In a slightly unexpected explanation, Kadyrbayev says that he took Dzhokhar's laptop because he did not want to the roommate to think that he was 'stealing or behaving suspiciously by just taking the backpack'.
