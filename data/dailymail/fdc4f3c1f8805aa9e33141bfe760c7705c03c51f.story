When Australian actor Damon Gameau found out he was going to be a father, he put his body on the line to find out the effects sugar can have on a person's health and well-being.

The question of what he was going to feed his little girl in her school lunch box prompted him to embark on a radical diet to measure the impact sugars in so-called 'healthy foods' can have on the body.

The Underbelly star only ate foods equivalent to 40 teaspoons of sugar a day - the average amount most Australians eat each day - for two months. He stuck to low fat foods and drinks perceived to be healthy, including muesli bars, low-fat yoghurt, cereal and juices.

But the outcome, captured in That Sugar Film, shocked Gameau, his then pregnant Winners & Losers girlfriend Zoe Tuckwell-Smith  and the number of medical professionals involved in the experiment.

The 38-year-old stacked on 8.5kg in 60 days and 10cm of visceral fat around his stomach.

'Within a month I was on the verge of being diabetic… I was very close to my liver getting cirrhosis. I was on the verge of obesity for my size. I hit that risk point,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'It was a complete shock, I had no knowledge of nutrition. I didn't think I'd have these results.'

He was shocked to find drinks like ice tea, vitamin waters, smoothies and sports drinks often had as much sugar as a can of coke.

Low fat mayonnaise, BBQ sauce and baked beans were also a major shock.  

When Gameau started dating Tuckwell-Smith, 32, in 2008, he  gave up alcohol, cigarettes and sugar in a bid to impress her.

So when he re-introduced refined sugar after three years, Gameau said he immediately noticed the impact it had on his mental and physical well-being - he was moody, lethargic and temperamental.

But after the 60 days were up and he went back to his whole food diet, Gameau said 90 percent of the weight fell right off just from cutting out the refined sugar.

Gameau and Tuckwell-Smith, who welcomed their baby girl Velvet midway through the sugar experiment, now regularly draw on the experience when the family prepares meals.

The couple rarely feed Velvet products with refined sugar and hope to move her away from sweet foods.  

'We don’t want to give her an eating disorder,' he said. 

'Zoe and I get the sugar we need from fruits… I think from my experience the palate does adjust. If you teach them the definition of sweet it doesn’t need to come from a Kit Kat.

'I hope with our daughter the sweetness (cravings) can come from fruit.

'We have a strong focus on being clean and leading a healthy life. She could learn that by copying us rather than us telling her.'

When it comes time for Gameau and Tuckwell-Smith to pack 14-month-old Velvet's lunch box, the pair are loading it with boiled eggs, carrot sticks, cheese and fruit

Gameau said he hopes his daughter Velvet will copy her parent's healthy lifestyle as they try to steer her away from foods with added sugar

In his film, Gameau made a point of consuming his 40 teaspoons of sugar in one sitting just from foods often found in a child's lunch box - museli bars, fruit juice and yoghurt were all on the menu. 

But when it comes time for Gameau and Tuckwell-Smith to pack 14-month-old Velvet's lunch box, the pair are adamant they'll steer clear of such foods. 

'Boiled eggs, carrot sticks with hommos, cheese – there are so many options. It’s just about being creative and not believing the marketing ploys,' he said.
