The confusion over whether we should carry an umbrella with us when we leave the home is about to clear up - with the Bureau of Meteorology dumping well-worn rain forecast terms in favour of predicting the chance of rain in your area as a percentage.

When you hear a weather forecast, can you tell the difference between isolated showers, scattered showers and patchy rain? What does the term 'a chance of rain' really mean?

From this week, you won't have to know, thanks to a planned overhaul of descriptors used by the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM).

'Chance of rain?' The old weather terminologies are on the way out to be replaced by the bureau of meteorology with a much easier to understand range of descriptions like slight, medium or high

After decades, the BOM is revolutionising its rainfall forecasts to make them more simple and clear.

0-10 per cent - there will be no mention of rain in the forecast

20-30 per cent - slight chance of rain

40-60 per cent - medium chance

70-80 per cent - high change of rain

90-100 per cent - very high chance

Under the new system, adjectives such as patchy, scattered, widespread and isolated will be replaced with the more straightforward terms of slight, medium, high or very high to describe the chances of rainfall.

The chance of rain will also be expressed in percentage terms, along with a forecast of how many millimetres of rain is expected.

The change has become possible because of the bureau's new Meteye Autographic information system, which divides the nation into six square kilometre grids and allows for highly localised meteorological observations and forecasting within each square.

National public weather manager Vernon Carr said the old system has had its day.

The bureau of meteorology admits its system has reached its 'use-by date' to be replaced by a more user friendly list of descriptions

'Basically, we're in a position that we can give people a bit more detail about when it's going to rain and how much rain they're likely to get, whereas in the past it was just words,' he said.

Mr Carr said the bureau had undertaken research which found that 'some of the terms we used weren't specific enough'.

'Now we're changing to what we hope will be a more meaningful presentation,' he added.

The new rain forecasts began in Tasmania and Western Australia on Monday.Victoria, NSW, the ACT and Queensland will begin in the new format on Tuesday, followed by the Northern Territory on Wednesday and South Australia on Thursday

'We're giving people a lot more background and detail now.'
