A 14-year-old believed to be the first British soldier killed in the First World War may have been a victim of 'friendly fire', it has been revealed.

Nearly 100 years after Private John Parr was shot, military experts have suggested his death may been an accident at the hands of his French and Belgian allies.

On the night he died, Private Parr is believed to have been at least 10 miles away from members of the German cavalry.

Headstone: The grave of Private John Parr, who died in Belgium in 1914. He is believed to have lied about his age to enlist and was the first victim of the First World War

Jon Cooksey, a military author, told 
The Sunday Times: 'There was no German soldier around to shoot at him. 
John Parr must have died either as a result of friendly fire or an 
accident.

Parr was last seen on the night of August 21, three weeks after war had been declared, when he was sent out to look for missing platoons.

Mr Cooksey, who studies German troop 
patterns, added: 'No contact with the British Expeditionary Force near 
Mons has been reported that day.'

He said opposition troops would have rushed to take credit for the death, because of their eagerness to be 
commended and praised for their actions.

The reconnaissance cyclist with the 4th battalion, Middlesex Regiment, is believed to have lied about his age to enlist, telling forces he was 17.

He is due to be honoured on August 4 at a special Anglo-German service to mark 100 years since war was declared.

A senior member of the Royal Family will visit his grave as part at St Symphorien near Mons in Belgium.

Remembrance: Men who helped to stem the German invasion of Belgium in 1914 march through the streets of Mons, the town where Private Parr is buried

Between 1914 and the warâ€™s end, almost one million more British troops lost their lives.

The
 last British soldier killed in action was Private George Ellison. He 
was also shot at Mons, just before the official ceasefire at 11am on 
November 11, 1918.

A Â£50m programme to commemorate the First World War is being planned by the Government, beginning with a major church service in Glasgow on August 4.

There will be six landmark events between 2014 and Armistice Day in 2018 Armistice Day, where a large nationwide event will mark the end of the war supposed to end all wars.

Mr Cooksey also exposed other myths surrounding the early stages of the Great War.

Captain Charles Hornby has been credited as the first person to draw blood during an incursion on August 22 by 'running his man through' with a sword.

However claims that German accounts have revealed none of their soldiers were seriously injured.
