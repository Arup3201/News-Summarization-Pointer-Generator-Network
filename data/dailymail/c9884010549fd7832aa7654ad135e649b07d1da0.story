For many, retirement is a chance to slow down. But those who want a healthy old age might be better off doing the opposite.

Pensioners who walk more and at a faster pace lower their risk of a heart attack, a study shows.

Rather than having a sedentary lifestyle in retirement, researchers found those aged over 65 who maintain or even boost their physical activity can improve their heart’s well-being.

A study of 985 adults with an average age 71 found that those who did the most exercise had an 11 per cent lower risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death than those who did the least.

Dr Luisa Soares-Miranda, of the Harvard School of Public Health in the US, said: ‘Any physical activity is better than none, but maintaining or increasing your activity has added heart benefits as you age.

‘Our results also suggest that these certain beneficial changes that occur may be reduced when physical activity is reduced.’

Scientists calculated that the difference between the highest and lowest levels of physical activity would translate into an estimated 11 per cent lower risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death.

Over five years researchers took heart monitor recordings and found that people who walked more and faster and had more physically active leisure time had fewer irregular heart rhythms and greater heart rate variability than those who were less active.

Heart rate variability is differences in the time between one heartbeat and the next during everyday life.

Dr Luisa Soares-Miranda, a researcher at the Harvard School of Public Health in the US, said: 'These small differences are influenced by the health of the heart and the nervous system that regulates the heart.

'Early abnormalities in this system are picked up by changes in heart rate variability, and these changes predict the risk of future heart attacks and death.'

The researchers evaluated 24-hour heart monitor recordings of 985 adults with an average age 71 participating in the community-based Cardiovascular Health Study, a large study of heart disease risk factors in people 65 and older.

The findings, published in the journal Circulation, found the more physical activity people engaged in, the better their heart rate variability.

Participants who increased their walking distance or pace during the five years also had better heart rate variability than those who reduced how much or how fast they walked.
