Whether it's a little black dress you've been dying to slip on or the prospect of holidaying in a barely-there swimsuit, goals play a fundamental role in weight loss.

But one man's light at the end of the weight loss tunnel was quite different to the norm.

Keith Gray was such a Doctor Who fanatic that he used the £2,000 that he saved when dieting to build his very own Tardis.

Dr Who fan Keith Gray spent £2,000 that he saved dieting on the Tardis, he lost 7 stone in the process

Keith once weighed 17 stone and would feast on takeaways for breakfast, now he has slimmed down and loves fish and vegetables

The 33-year-old from Dalston, East 
London, paid for the life-size square blue police box by saving the 
money he usually spent on junk food and now vows never to return to his 
former seventeen stone self.

The advertising and art director said: 'When I was a boy I used to leave a Tardis-sized space empty in my bedroom in case The Doctor landed. Now at last it feels like he has!'

Keith asked his carpenter father Gordon to build the box, which now stands pride of place in his lounge and is used as an office.

He added: 'I love the Time Lord but when I was overweight I never had the get up and go to do anything different. I’ve wanted a Tardis since I was a child and I’ve rewarded myself after losing the weight.

'Now, I can indulge my passion. I use it as my office and I can sit in there and work and write and it’s very relaxing.

'Some people spend their money on new clothes, or a holiday but I really wanted a Tardis.'

Keith, who is 5ft 10in weighed almost 17 stone when he started on the Lighter Life weightloss programme last year.

At 17st, Keith didn't feel happy and after standing on the scales he decided it was time to take action

Four months on he achieved his goal of 10 stone and his waistline slimmed down from 39 inches to 28.

'I hadn’t always been big but over the last few years the weight has crept on.

'Then one day last year I got a shock while buying some furniture in Ikea. For some reason I stepped onto a pair of scales in the bathroom section and couldn’t believe what I saw! I knew I had to do something,' he said.

Keith, whose favourite Dr Who was Peter Davison who starred in the series in the early Eighties, was eating bacon sandwiches or Big Mac meals for breakfast, huge portions of pasta or pizza and snacking on chocolate and crisps in between.

He uses the Tardis, that he has dreamed of having since he was young, as an office

He said: 'I was spending around £250 a week on food. I couldn’t just have dinner, I’d have to have lots of toast before I went to bed. I was eating all day without a break.

'LightLife cost me £75 a week so I was saving around £175 a week which I put into a pot for my Tardis.

'Now I eat porridge for breakfast, steamed fish or chicken with rice and pasta and lots of fruit.

'If I ever feel tempted I look at my Tardis and remember that the old Keith probably wouldn’t have fitted into it!'
