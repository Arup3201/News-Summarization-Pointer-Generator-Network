A promising teenage footballer has been killed in a road accident.

Marcus Powell, who played for Cheltenham Town, died in hospital today after being hit by a car while out jogging.

'We are sad to confirm the news that Cheltenham Town Under-16 player Marcus Powell has passed away,' the club said in a statement.

'Sixteen-year-old Marcus unfortunately suffered injuries in an incident involving a car at the weekend whilst out jogging but Marcus was unable to pull through.

'The club's thoughts are with Marcus' family and friends at this difficult time.'

West Mercia Police said the crash happened last night as he was running along the B4349 from Kingstone towards Clehonger, near Hereford.

He received serious head injuries when he was involved in a collision with a silver BMW X5, which was travelling in the same direction.

Marcus was flown to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham by helicopter. He was in a critical condition and died today.

In a mark of respect, Cheltenham Town has
cancelled games this weekend for the Under-9 to Under-16 teams and also
cancelled its youth training sessions.

Inspector Damian Sowrey said: 'I would 
like to hear from anyone who saw this young runner or the BMW in the 
Kingstone-Clehonger area in the lead up to the collision.'
