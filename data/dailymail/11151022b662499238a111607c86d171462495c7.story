Prime Minister David Cameron has been hosted at the White House for a working dinner with President Barack Obama, where the two leaders were expected to discuss economic growth, trade and security.

Mr Cameron arrived at the White House late last night after having spent his first day in Washington meeting with Christine Lagarde, director of the International Monetary Fund.

Mr Obama greeted him in the Oval Office before the two walked together into the presidential residence to begin their discussions.

It was revealed today a cyber cell of British and American intelligence and security agents is being created to defeat online attacks in an 'unprecedented' deal to be struck by Mr Cameron and the President.

Mr Obama is toughening up the American response in the wake of the embarrassing and damaging North Korean hack on Sony Pictures and the infiltration of Pentagon Twitter and YouTube sites.

Ahead of tonight's working dinner, Mr Cameron warned of the increasing threat of cyber attacks.

'This is an evolving threat which poses a real risk to our businesses and that's why we're taking our cooperation with the US to an unprecedented level. This is about pooling our effort so we stay one step ahead of those who seek to attack us.

The leaders' discussions were undertaken last night during a 'working dinner'. Judging by the menu, it looks to have been one of Mr Cameron's more enjoyable duties.

'The joint exercises and training of our next generation of cyber experts will help to ensure that we have the capability we need to protect critical sectors like our energy, transport and financial infrastructure from emerging threats.'

Under the plans GCHQ and MI5 will join forces with NSA and FBI to turn an American cyber cell into a transatlantic operation, to improve information sharing about threats.

The Prime Minister's two-day trip to Washington appears to have started well - earlier in the day Miss Lagarde lavished him with praise for Britain's role in leading the world in economic growth.

However, their leaders' meeting comes amid heightened fears about terrorism in Europe and the West after last week's terrorist attacks in France, in which 17 people were slain.

Cyber-terrorism and surveillance will be central issues at the visit, which Tory strategists hope will be a pre-election ‘love-in’ between Mr Cameron and Mr Obama and boost the Prime Minister’s standing at home.

Unusually, the President has agreed to host Mr Cameron close to an election, apparently repaying the favour Mr Cameron made by visiting the US and all but endorsing him during the last presidential race.
