Damning: Professor Frank Furedi co-authored the report which suggests we should stop complaining so much

An American-style compensation culture is bleeding the NHS and schools dry, a leading academic warns today.

Some teachers have become so scared of litigation that class ‘trips’ consist of simply taking pupils out into their own playgrounds, says Professor Frank Furedi.

His devastating analysis blames a toxic combination of ambulance-chasing  lawyers and growing damages claims which are costing taxpayers billions.

Doctors and teachers are routinely expected to ‘tick boxes’ to follow health and safety rules even at the expense of what is actually best for patients and pupils, he argues.

This has led to excessive risk-aversion in schools, which ban playground games or restrict school trips, claims Prof Furedi, emeritus professor of sociology at the University of Kent.

Settlements include £3,000 for a pupil suffering cuts from rose bushes and £30,000 for a pupil injured falling off a bench.

Risky? The complaints culture in Britain is making teachers so scared of litigation that they take school trips in the playground

However, some teachers are also cashing in by taking legal action themselves, he adds in his book The Social Cost Of Litigation.

Around £6.7million was paid out by councils in 2010 to employees who sued over injuries picked up at work, says Prof Furedi, whose work was commissioned by the Centre for Policy Studies think-tank.

He adds that compensation demands were no longer seen as selfish acts by ‘have-a-go’ parents but as responsible action to stop other children having similar accidents.

He says claims against the NHS are rising, along with defensive practices aimed at avoiding litigation.

Claims were ‘perceived not only as a commonsense way of gaining financial compensation, but as a way of holding public services to account’, he says, adding: ‘But the combination of an engrained compensation culture and litigation avoidance is bleeding health and education dry: both financially, and in terms of their public sector ethos and professional role.’

Report claims that the complaints culture is costing our hospitals and schools in the long run

The NHS Litigation Authority estimates the cost of potential negligence claims at £16.6billion.

However, of the 63,800 claims for medical negligence made since 2001, only about 2,000 have had damages set by a court. Another 28,700 were settled out of court.

‘Suing a publicly funded institution such as the NHS amounts to a spectacular own goal for citizens,’ said Prof Furedi.

‘The fear of litigation erodes professional autonomy, stifles innovation, leads to defensive practices and encourages bureaucracy.

‘If we want to put a brake on the culture of litigation and litigation avoidance in Britain, we need to look beyond ambulance-chasers and greedy lawyers to the cultural conditions that have allowed litigious sentiments to flourish as common sense.’

Tim Knox, director of the Centre for Policy Studies, believes professionals aren't always offering what's best for their pupils or patients

Tim Knox, director of the Centre for Policy Studies, said ‘This rise in the compensation culture has huge – if largely hidden – costs. In particular, it has created a climate in which professionals will prioritise litigation avoidance above what is best for their pupils or patients.

‘So many schools have reduced the extra-curricular activities that enrich children’s experience while at school, from school trips to outdoor play, while doctors are incentivised to follow “best practice” rather than follow their professional judgment.’
