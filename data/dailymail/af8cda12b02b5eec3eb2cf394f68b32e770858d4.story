When Molly Anne Dutton was crowned homecoming queen last week her adopted mother Peggy was by her side.

But it was her birth mother, who made the decision to continue with her pregnancy after being the victim of rape, who inspired Molly to put herself forward to be Auburn University's 100th Miss Homecoming.

Alabama adoption charity Lifeline Children's Services helped Molly's biological mother continue her pregnancy after her husband ordered her to get an abortion or face divorce.

Radiant: Molly Anne's homecoming platform was adoption, to celebrate the chance she had at life

'Because that resource was made 
available to my mother, she decided to give birth to me, and here I am 
22 years later,' Molly proudly said.

The horticultural student dedicated her homecoming platform to the adoption charity under her Light Up Life campaign that quickly found support on campus.

'It was an easy decision,'; Molly said of her adoption advocacy platform. 'However, it wasn't an obvious decision.'

The 22-year-old had initially wanted to work towards a plant-based cause or campaign against human trafficking.

But as she discussed ideas with friends over lunch, one of them suggested that she should advocate a cause that had impacted her directly.

Celebration: Molly tried to make her campaign fun, saying she was concerned about the stigma associated with her story

'One of the girls said, "Molly, what do you think about sharing your story",' she said. 'I had shared it with a smaller audience. I am honored to carry that story.'

Her interview panel were equally moved by her story, as were the 25,000 students on Auburn's campus.

For a week, Molly's team distributed yellow daisies and sold green and yellow T-shirts across campus, with proceeds going to Lifeline Children's Services.

The charity had helped arrange her adoption and Molly said she grew up in a loving home, the youngest of six children, four of whom had been adopted.

Her team campaigned for her under the slogan Light Up Life, as Molly pushed her platform of adoption.

'We had to think of a way to gain momentum and get other students invested,' John Canada, who helped Molly campaign, said.

'The only answer we could think of to do that was simply tell her story and celebrate how radiant life is,' he added.

As Molly's story captured the attention of her fellow students, donations started flowing in for Lifeline.

'That has just rippled out,' she said. 'That's been the biggest [change], to know that it's not just students who know my story, but men and women across the nation.'

Molly said she was comfortable sharing her story but hadn't been prepared for the way it encouraged other students to share personal details about their lives.

'It was a very emotional time. Vulnerability breeds vulnerability,' she said. 'That was a very special part of the week.'

She told Fox News and Friends that finding a way to tell her story had been difficult, but her and her friends wanted to get across the message that life is radiant.

'We knew there was a lot of stigma. Sexual assault or abortion carry negative stigma,' she said. 'We wanted to make [the campaign] fun and to know that life is so light and radiant.'

Unlike many Miss Homecoming candidates, Molly ran without the support of a sorority or other large organization. She was funded by a club within the horticulture department, the Professional Landcare Network and said the small department has been supportive of her campaign.

'I went to class and I did get a "Congratulations" from my professor, which was awesome,' Molly said.

Now that her whirlwind campaign is over, Molly is looking forward to carrying out her Miss Homecoming duties, which includes acting as a liaison between university students and alumni.

'It wasn't ever running against; it was running with four other girls,' Molly said of her campaign. 'Every day last week, when I put my head on the pillow, I just felt so accomplished.'

She added that she was 'full of gratitude' for the Auburn student body that supported her platform and her personal experience with adoption.

'[I was given grace to carry that story,' she said. 'My story is a voice for the voiceless.'
