Boris Johnson has been named the most influential man in Britain, edging out George Osborne, Prince Charles and even Prime Minister David Cameron.

The Mayor of London, who won plaudits for his handling of the widely-praised Olympic Games, triumphed over luminaries in politics, showbusiness and top executives in a list published by GQ magazine.

The list is heavily influenced by the Summer Olympics, with cyclists Bradley Wiggins and Chris Hoy reaching 15th place, and runner Mo Farah hitting 34th following his two gold medals.

Power: Boris Johnson has been named 'The Most Influential Man in Britain' by GQ magazine

Gamesmaker: The London Mayor was praised for his handling of the Olympic Games and is noted for his high-profile appearances, such as his encounter with a faulty zipwire in London's Victoria Park

Other top Tories in the list include Cameron, Chancellor George Osborne, Education Secretary Michael Gove and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt.

The Royal Family was also represented, with the Prince of Wales in 12th and Prince Harry at 18th.

Prince Harry was deemed far more 
influential than his brother Prince William, the third-in-line to the throne, who was 
given 33rd place in the list.

The Prince hit the headlines for both his military service in Afghanistan and the pictures that emerged of him partying naked in a Las Vegas hotel room.

In what appears to reflect the television programme Yes, Minister, where a civil servant guides the decisions of the minister he is meant to be serving, Sir jeremy Heywood, cabinet secretary, was voted more influential Prime Minster David Cameron.

The list, which is out in the February 
edition of the magazine that will hit stands tomorrow, the top 20 is 
heavily dominated by government figures, with seven political players 
being included.

A spokesman for GQ told the Telegraph
that the Leveson Inquiry had replaced press power with 'institutional 
scrutiny and new-media guruism'.

She said that the list had a large 
proportion of old-Etonians and wealthy figures who were more guarded 
about their private lives after the explosion of web gossips who 
discussed the details of the rich and famous.

She added: 'Untrammelled power like that wielded by Rupert Murdoch is replaced by institutional scrutiny and new-media guruism.

'In reaction there has been a resurgence of the old guard – former Etonians dominate public life once more, including the mayor of London, the archbishop of Canterbury and the prime minister.

Keeping it in the family: Prince Charles and his youngest son Prince Harry both made it into the top 20 - but surprisingly the Duke of Cambridge only made it to 33rd place

'Meanwhile with the rise in power of web gossip factories, businessmen are much less willing to court the public eye.

'The flamboyant tycoons of the past have been replaced by more retiring figures who avoid the limelight.

'Money no longer shouts, it murmurs.'

GQ compiled the list with a 'star chamber' of figures at the top of their fields to help draw up 'the definitive countdown of the men who really run Britain'.

The magazine consulted with a panel of various industries to compose their Influential List.

The panel featured PR mastermind Matthew Freud, Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti, Arcadia boss Sir Philip Green, literary agent Ed Victor, Daily Mail editor-in-chief Paul Dacre, president of the Royal Society Sir Paul Nurse, entrepreneurial tycoon Richard Branson and co-director of the Serpentine Gallery Hans Ulrich Obrist.
