A teenage girl from Houston, who told her parents she was spending the night with a friend, was found with a 31-year-old man she had met online.

The girl, who has not been named, was spotted with Robert Tyler Patrick, when police pulled their car over in the early hours of Saturday.

Patrick claimed to be taking the girl to stay with family in San Antonio, but 
the teenager told police she was going to Patrick's apartment, after meeting him on social network, Whisper.

Stopped: Robert Tyler Patrick has been charged with soliciting a minor after traffic police found him with a 16-year-old girl

Several bags and a suitcase belonging to the girl were found in the car, and Patrick claimed he was helping the teenager because she had been thrown out of home.

But, when police called the girl's parents, they told officers their daughter hadn't been thrown out and that they believed she was staying with a friend.

They also said they were unaware their daughter had been seeing Patrick, who is nearly twice her age.

Patrick had been pulled over by police in Tomball because he had an expired registration sticker. He later admitted he had been having an 'inappropriate relationship' with the teenager, the Houston Chronicle reported.

The teenager claimed they had met through the social networking app Whisper, which allows users to anonymously post messages and pictures, and also send private messages.

A police statement sent to Mail Online states that the teenager told police the pair had communicated online, sharing messages and pictures, for a few days before agreeing to meet in person.

On the day police stopped them, the girl said she had arranged to go to Patrick's apartment.

Claims: Patrick is accused of pretending to be a 17-year-old boy when the pair chatted on the Whisper App

Patrick allegedly later told police he and the teenager had sent explicit pictures to each other. Court documents allege that he had pretended to be 17 during online conversations with the teenager.

Patrick was charged with solicitation of a minor and was released on $10,000 bond. He is next due in court on April 24.Â 

The 31-year-old could face further 
charges after detectives finish their investigation of cell phones and 
computers that were taken from the pair.
