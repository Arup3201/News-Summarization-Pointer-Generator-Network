Roy Hodgson told his young England players in a post-training pep talk on Wednesday that they must seize their big chance at the World Cup.

England’s head coach pointedly took Luke Shaw, Raheem Sterling and Ross Barkley aside for individual conversations lasting several minutes at the end of their hour-long session.

Shaw (18), Sterling (19) and Barkley 
(20) are the youngest members of the squad and he was keen to stress 
that they are heading to the World Cup on merit.

Sterling
 was the outstanding player during Wednesday's open training session, 
but Hodgson wants to make sure the young England players are fully 
prepared.

The head coach 
said: ‘They should be pleased they are here, but they shouldn’t feel 
over-awed by the occasion because they have done well and deserve their 
place.

‘It was just to tell 
them they are here on merit. I haven’t detected any nerves at all. There
 was a feeling of relief because they realised this year my choice 
wasn’t easy.

‘There has been a great feeling of enthusiasm and let’s get started on this adventure we have all been looking forward to.

‘If
 you want to have a chat with a player, it leads nicely into it, rather 
than asking someone after dinner to come and speak to you, which is more
 formal.’

Hodgson has 
thrown a protective cloak around his players after criticism of his 
selection of Manchester United pair Chris Smalling and Phil Jones.

Former
 Manchester United captain Roy Keane was scathing about the pair after 
Hodgson called them into his 23-man World Cup squad.

Keane
 claimed the pair ‘have gone backwards’ at United and questioned the 
wisdom of taking them to football’s biggest tournament.

Hodgson
 added: ‘I work on the simple basis that everyone has an opinion. If you
 are a TV pundit you are required to give your opinion and I don’t 
expect everyone’s opinions to fall in with mine. If you say to me, has 
it been a great year for Manchester United and have Phil Jones and 
Smalling been stars then of course they haven’t.

‘But
 as far as I am concerned they are England players because they have 
been England players through my two years and any games in particular 
that Smalling has played —he has played more than Jones — he has 
certainly never let me down.’

Hodgson
 also approved of Jack Wilshere’s decision to speak with Paul Scholes 
over his criticism of the Arsenal midfielder’s development. Wilshere 
tracked Scholes down through England assistant coach Gary Neville after 
he claimed the Arsenal FA Cup winner had failed to develop.

Hodgson added: ‘I’m always pleased and impressed when players handle those moments in the right way.

When
 he had a (Twitter) row with Kevin Pietersen that was at the other end 
of the scale . . . but it’s not going to decide if we have a good World 
Cup or not. If Jack answers criticism well or badly, it’s what he does 
on the field that matters.’

England
 return home at the weekend before they convene at St George’s Park on 
Monday to prepare for a farewell friendly against Peru at Wembley next 
week.

On Wednesday the 
players wore three distinctive blue sweat patches as Hodgson’s sports 
science team monitored their body temperature with a new technique.

Three
 sports scientists from Loughborough University have been flown out to 
Portugal to take samples of the players’ sweat as they prepare for the 
humid conditions of Manaus, where England play their first group game on
 June 14 against Italy.

They
 are working with the Arsenal nutritionist James Collins during the 
World Cup. Collins, who has previously worked with British Olympic 
teams, monitors diet and food supplements, as well as electrolyte 
recovery and matchday preparation.

Hodgson
 added: ‘Up to now the work has been very sports science and fitness 
orientated. They are being analysed in terms of the extra heat we tried 
to generate and it is part of our process which Dave Reddin and his team
 have started.’

England’s 
players were also introduced to team psychiatrist Steve Peters on 
Tuesday for the first time since he was appointed by the FA.

Hodgson
 added: ‘I asked him to present himself to us and he did that in a very 
entertaining and informative way. The players were very attentive. 
Sitting behind them watching them listen suggested they were interested.

‘He
 is an entertaining man. He just told us all the things he’s done in 
life. It’s quite amazing. I don’t know how old he is but to do all the 
things he’s done in life he must be about 150.’

On
 Wednesday Everton defender John Stones, who is on standby for the 
squad, missed the session after tweaking his knee. And Jones, who is 
recovering from a shoulder injury, should be able to take part in 
contact training later this week.
