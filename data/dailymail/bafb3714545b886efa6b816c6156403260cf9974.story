While for most Cinema had its heyday a long, long time ago, enthusiasts have been going to ever greater lengths to create the most authentic cinematic experience possible.

They range from the wacky, such as a caravan claiming to be The World's Smallest Solar Theatre, to the ground-breaking technological wizardry of CGV Cheongdam Cine City, where the audience is bombarded with a string of special effects to give them the impression they are part of the film.

In a report in the Independent, the top 10 'weirdest' cinemas were named.

Authentic: The Worlds Smallest Solar Movie Theatre was the brainchild of Paul O'Connor and Jo Furlong

Red carpet: The cinema seats 16 people, who are shown in by ushers and treated to popcorn

Sol Cinema, South Wales

The brainchild of Paul O'Connor and Jo Furlong, the World's Smallest Solar Movie Theatre can travel anywhere in the world.

It is set in a caravan and includes a red carpet, popcorn, an usher and room for 16 people.

The 'World's Smallest Solar Movie Theatre' is the brainchild of Paul O'Connor and Jo Furlong.

The pair wanted to parody mainstream cinema, and only shows short films about 10 minutes long.

Audiences can choose the film they want to see and even enjoy the screening with a bag of pop corn.

The cinema has already appeared at Glastonbury, where a 60-second version of Harry Potter was shown.

The duo now want to organise a tour across Europe.

Guantanamo Bay, Cuba

There are 164 prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, and about 1,000 guards keeping a close watch over them.

When they are not on duty, they can often be found on the other side of the wall watching two outdoor cinemas.

They show the latest Hollywood blockbusters on an area the size of a football pitch, which has been decked out with tiered stadium seats.

Edge of your seat: Paris Treetop Screenings were created in the canopy of a Parisian forest

Paris treetop screenings

The
 canopy of a Parisian forest provided an unlikely setting for a cinema, 
where a mesh platform was built in the treetops to show fantasy 
adventure film Epic.

The event was organised by RealID Europe, in collaboration with Fox Studios and Garnier.

Managing
 director Bob Mayson said: 'The structure was a real feat of 
organisation and imagination, intended to immerse viewers deep into the 
3D world of Epic.

'When the
 audience ascended up the rope ladders and found themselves in a fully 
functioning cinema right in the heart of nature, you could see the 
wonder in their eyes.'

Golden Village Cinema, Singapore

This cinema attracts customers looking for a luxurious experience, with 56 reclining seats and theatre staff who will top up your drink and provide you with exquisite cuisine.

The service includes transport to and from the cinema and caters for private parties.

CGV Cheongdam Cine City, South Korea

The
 cinema experience has reached new heights in the capital Seoul, with 
moving seats, special lighting, wind, fog and scent-based effects to 
bring you ever closer to the film.

At
 a screening of Titanic, the audience's seats were tiled and sea-scented
 water was sprayed giving the impression they were going down with the 
ship.

This 4DX experience is catching on as similar cinemas spring up in Mexico, China and Russia.

Kino Pionier 1909 cinema, Poland

The two screen cinema in Szcecin is said to be the oldest continuously-running cinema in the world.

It is still going strong having survived two world wars and the fall of communism.

The owners believe the cinema was even functioning two years earlier than first thought.

The cinema has changed little in more than 100 years, although it did receive some restoration work in 2002.

The Archipelago Cinema, Thailand

Imagine floating on a raft at sea in total darkness, with a jungle backdrop and towering rocks either side.

Now place a cinema screen into this dramatic landscape.

The
 Archipelago Cinema, designed by Beijing-based architect, Ole Scheeren, 
was created specifically for the Film On The Rocks Yao Noi Festival last
 year.

Scheeren made a 
floating platform from recycled wood. This has been strewn with bean 
bags, which the audience sit on while watching an enormous screen that 
has been secured to the ocean floor.

Hollywood Forever Cemetery, California

Hollywood
 Forever Cemetery is a huge draw for thousands of cinema goers each 
year, who gather to watch classics like Rebel Without a Cause.

The
 films are projected onto the side of the mausoleum containing the 
bodies of silent-film legend, Rudolph Valentino, and Oscar-winning actor
 Peter Finch.

There are also late night screenings of horror films, such as The Shining and Halloween.

Event Cornwall Outdoor Screenings

Event Cornwall first started in in 2009 with films shown on a ferry as part of the Truro & Penwith College Fal River Festival.

To give the first screening of Jaws added spice, a fisherman's boat circled the ferry with just one light on.

Last year, during a Perfect Storm, it poured with rain.

The concept was taken to new heights when Friday 13th was filmed in Tehidy Woods in Camborne. During the chase scene through the woods, the audience could not tell where the screen stopped and the woods started.

Other screenings have included Point Break on Godrevy Head, overlooking surfing beaches, and Top Gun in the Skybus hangar of Newquay Cornwall airport.

Cine Thisio, Greece

Not only is the Cine Thisio the oldest outdoor cinema in Athens, what really sets it apart from all the rest is the background views of the Acropolis and Parthenon.

The cinema also attracts big names, such as Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy who attended the premiere of Before Midnight there.
