In the area nowadays you can find a £15-a-night caravan site with coin-operated hot showers.

But while the Manor Caravan Park in Happisburgh, Norfolk, might not sound luxurious today - it's certainly a major improvement on what it would have been like there 1million years ago.

Scientists now believe early humans created their first settlement at the coastal site - which lies north-east of Norwich - after finding a series of stone tools and fossilised animal remains there.

The artefacts have been dated to 
nearly 1million years ago, which makes them the oldest found in Britain -
 and suggests the species who lived there were primitive predecessors of
 modern humans.

They could 
have been the Homo antecessor or Homo erectus species, who both had 
comparatively small brains and might have even been cannibals as well as
 hunters, reported The Sunday Times.

The
 dramatic discoveries are set to be revealed next month in the ‘Britain:
 One Million Years of the Human Story’ exhibition at the Natural History
 Museum in South Kensington, Central London.

Scientists
 believe the site the early humans lived on was on the River Thames, 
which flowed out into the North Sea at that time - and are finding the 
north Norfolk coast to be a goldmine of artefacts.

Experts are making many new discoveries with the coastline being one of the UK’s fastest-eroding - but they are yet to find any human remains from our predecessors, reported The Sunday Times.

Professor Chris Stringer from the museum said: ‘From the earliest human fossils in Britain to one of the oldest wooden tools in the world, you will be surprised by the history hidden beneath your feet.

‘The story behind the humans who inhabited ancient Britain has taken us more than a decade to piece together. This gives us an exciting glimpse into our past (and) leads us to reflect on our future.’

Temperatures when the first humans arrived in Britain would have been several degrees colder than nowadays - and they would have also faced dangerous wildlife including sabre-toothed cats.

However, they would have been attracted by the chance of hunting mammoths and bison - as well as being able to walk to mainland Europe, with Kent connected to Germany by land at that time.

We still know relatively few facts about the homo antecessor, but it is
believed they were the first Britons because they were the only known to live
in Europe at the time.

Fossil remains found in Spain suggest they had stronger
brows and bigger teeth than modern humans - but also smaller brains and potentially
even cannibalistic behaviour.

They would have lived on the flood plains and marshes that
bordered the ancient route of the River Thames in Norfolk, alongside sabre-toothed cats, hyenas,
horses, mammoths and deer.

They measured around 5ft 6in to 6ft, weighed between 9st and
14st and are believed to have been right-handed. However, no complete skeletons have
ever been found.
