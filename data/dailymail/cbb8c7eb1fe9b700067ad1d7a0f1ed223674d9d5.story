A Colorado man is fighting to bring back his two daughters who he claims were abducted by his ex-wife to Argentina.

Dennis Burns, of Snowmass, has spent the past three years missing out on the lives of his daughters, Sophia, 4, and Victoria, 7.

His ex-wife, Ana Alianelli, took them from their home after a Colorado judge ordered that the children stay in the US after a bitter 13-month long custody battle following their divorce.

A judge ordered their immediate return, but it was too late. The children were 3 and 1 years old at the time.

Alianelli had accused Burns of having abused her during their five-year marriage and requested to relocate with the children to Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Burns, who works in real estate, objected that the move would make him ‘just an acquaintance, not a father’.

The judge found the claims of abuse against Burns to be unfounded and declared Burns the primary residential parent.

Burns said the ruling made him overjoyed.

‘I felt a sense of relief that was just beautiful. And I was like, 'I'm going to be able to spend time with my daughters, finally, and live with them and be able to teach them things, and show them things, and live here with them in Colorado',’ he told CNN.

But three weeks later, in September 2010, the girls disappeared from the home, and have been in Argentina ever since.

He has been able to see his daughters, but he must travel to Buenos Aires at his own expense - a trip he's made seven times. And when he does visit his girls, he brings a witness.

His lawyer, Caroline Langley, who specializes in child abduction laws and has expertise with Hague cases, said it was for his protection.

‘We always make sure that somebody goes with him, someone from the embassy, a neutral third party,’ Langley told CNN.

Alianelli has refused to talk about the case. Her attorney, Daniel Mercado, provided a statement in Spanish, saying ‘Ms. Alianelli does not wish to make a comment with respect to the case.’

There are currently thousands of similar unresolved international custody cases in the United States, and the U.S. State Department receives about 1,200 new cases each year.

Argentina is one of the more than 80 signatory countries of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, a 1980 treaty by which nations work together to solve international abduction cases quickly.

According to the treaty, the first custody hearing is supposed to be held six to eight weeks from when the applications to have the children returned are filed.

Burns' first hearing was in December 2012, more than two years after Victoria and Sophia were taken.

Langley said the longer time that passes, the more strongly a child will begin to ‘identify with their abductor’.

‘The psychological trauma to the children starts on that slippery slope where it's very, very difficult to pull them back from being so aligned with the abductor,’ she told CNN.

Burns' mother, Marie Burns, who lives in New Jersey, says she cries every time she sees a girl who looks like Victoria.

'A little girl comes in (a restaurant) with her dad or her family and happened to look like Victoria and I'm sitting there eating with a friend, and suddenly, I'm bawling,' she said.

Burns must wait for the legal process
to take its course. An appellate court in Buenos Aires ruled in favor 
of him bringing Victoria and Sophia back to the US, but Alianelli 
appealed the decision.

Burns is now waiting for the Supreme Court of Buenos Aires to hear his case.

A website has been set up to seek support for Burns' cause and raise awareness about international child abduction.

It includes a petition urging the government of Argentina to honour the U.S. court ruling and return Sophia and Victoria to their father's custody.

The website also asks people to press their members of Congress to pass a bill introduced in October that would strengthen safeguards against international child abduction.

He has been working alongside another American father, David Goldman, who knows exactly what Burns is going through.

Goldman's 5½-year journey to get his son, Sean, returned from Brazil after he was
abducted by his mother drew international attention, and gives Burns 
hope that he will succeed as well.

Burns and Goldman have been meeting with various politicians, including Congressman Chris Smith, whose recent International Child Abduction Prevention legislation cleared the Committee of Foreign Affairs. The bill will now head to the House Floor.

In the meantime, Burns says the financial strain has forced him to file for bankruptcy and foreclose on his home.

He
lives in a one-bedroom apartment filled with photos of his daughters in
every room, on every wall. Their tiny coats still hang on hooks near 
his front door.

But he says Goldman's success story gives him strength.

Goldman and his son were at the center of a long and bitter international custody row.

The Christmas Eve reunion in 2009 ordered by 
Brazil's Supreme Court capped a five-year legal battle by Goldman, against the Brazilian family of his ex-wife, who died in 
childbirth in 2008. She had remarried after her divorce with Goldman.

‘He's thriving,’ says Goldman of his now 13-year-old son.

‘He's playing lacrosse, he's playing basketball on the travel team. He just came home yesterday and they had their (school) pictures.’

Burns says he dreams of the days when his life can go back to normal.

‘I don't have the opportunity with them to get them out of bed in the morning, make them breakfast, take them to school,’ he said. ‘I just want to be able to know that they are there every day and be able to hug them and love them.’
