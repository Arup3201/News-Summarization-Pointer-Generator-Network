The best commercial aired during the Super Bowl was one most of the country didn’t see – until now.

Personal injury attorney Jamie Casino’s two minute, sledgehammer-wielding, heavy metal blasting, tombstone-smashing shot at the Savannah (GA) Police Department after the shooting death of his brother only aired locally.

Mr Casino was a criminal defense attorney until the 2012 killing, and he told WTOC he made the ad ‘to vindicate my brother’ against allegations he was involved in criminal activity.

Based on real events: The ad is based on real events that happened in 2010, and first shows Jamie Casino as a 'wealthy' criminal defense attorney

Shot dead: Casino's younger brother Michael was shot dead along with three other people in 2012, police said 'no innocent people were shot'

‘Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, ensure justice for those being crushed,’ reads a bible passage that begins the advertisement.

‘I wasn’t always a personal injury lawyer,’ Mr Casino says. ‘I once was a notorious criminal defense lawyer who was employed by some of the most cold-hearted villains – my art brought me great wealth.’

This all changed when his younger brother Michael and friend Emily Pickels were two of four people gunned down in the city in a single weekend, he explains, adding that police had ‘deceived’ the public about the circumstances surrounding the shootings.

‘No innocent people were targeted,’ former chief Wille Lovett’s voice can be heard saying while a caricature is shown on-screen.

His son is then shown asking ‘daddy, what do you do when you go to work?’

‘At some point a man must ask why God created him,’ says Mr Casino just before heavy metal thrashes into the forefront and shows him standing over a grave holding a rose.

A metal montage shows Chief Lovett again, this time on a fictionalized newspaper with the headline ‘Chief’s comments disgrace victims’ families, a picture of his brother, another fictionalized headline that reads ‘Casino says he forgives but never forgets’ and a sledgehammer with his brother’s name lying on top of his grave.

The sledgehammer is normally used in his other ads to ‘smash money out of stingy insurance companies’ for injury victims, according to the Savannah Morning News.

Time to pay: The sledgehammer appears over his brother's grave

First he drags it through the dirt while flames trail behind and the song screams out ‘the time has come to make things right,’ then he uses it to smash his brother’s tombstone.

‘I’m attorney Jamie Casino, and I don’t represent villains anymore,’ he says. ‘I speak for innocent victims who cannot speak for themselves.’

Reactions to the ad have been mixed, but Casino remains unfazed.

He did it ‘to let people know in Savannah that there’s some people that won’t keep their mouth shut, some people that will take their point to the Super Bowl… I think I pulled that off.’

Many people on Twitter loved the spot, calling it ‘the ad of the Super Bowl’ and the ‘ad of the year.’

‘I’m buying what this guy’s selling,’ tweeted one person.

‘He outdid the big advertisers with this one,’ another person tweeted.

Several others begged for it to be made into a movie.

‘This is awesome,’ a fan commented on the lawyer's YouTube page.

Not everyone agreed.

‘Although it is sad what happened to his brother, in my opinion, he exploited it for his own personal gain,’ one person wrote on the Savannah Morning News Facebook page.

‘Like all his commercials, offensive,’ another person wrote.

‘It makes all lawyers look bad,’ a senior partner at a local law firm commented.

The former police chief declined to comment when reached by WTOC, the station said.
