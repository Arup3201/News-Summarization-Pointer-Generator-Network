A puppy had a lucky escape when her owner discovered that a pebble she was playing with on the beach was a World War Two hand grenade with the pin still in.

The young Pomeranian called Bibi sniffed out the rusty explosive while out walking with her owner Jason Edwards at Canford Cliffs in Poole, Dorset.

Mr Edwards initially thought that the device was a large stone.

Lucky escape: Six-month-old Pomeranian Bibi, pictured with owner Jason Edwards, found a 70-year-old World War Two grenade on the beach at Canford Cliffs in Poole, Dorset

Dangerous: The rusty World War two grenade was probably left behind following a D-Day training exercise whoch took place just up the shore at Studland, Dorset

Disarmed: A bomb disposal crew took the grenade to a secluded part of the beach and carried out a controlled explosion on it

But fortunately he soon realised that six-month-old Bibi had found a 70-year-old grenade and grabbed his dog to pull her to safety.

The beach had to be evacuated and bomb disposal experts had to be called in to carry out a controlled explosion.

Mr Edwards, 41, said: 'Bibi started sniffing something which looked like a very large brown stone.

'It just didn't look right and it had distinct markings on that you don't ever see on rocks or stones.

'I had a closer look, because we are never quite sure what she is going to eat, and it resembled a hand grenade from the Second World War.

Nerves of steel: Two bomb disposal experts prepare to detonate the grenade yesterday

'It looked like the sort of thing you see in the old war movies.

Curious: The puppy found what Mr Edwards initially thought was a large brown stone, but he soon realised what the object was and pulled Bibi away to safety

He added: 'I pulled Bibi back and put a pile of stones there because the tide was lapping over it. It looked rusty and there was an oily film around it.

'Fortunately there weren't many people around. If it had been the summer with kids playing down here then you dread to think what might have happened.

'Bibi is very lucky she didn't try to eat it.'

Mr Edwards, from Poole, remained at the scene until police arrived to warn other people about the grenade yesterday morning.

Police and beach wardens cordoned off a 250 metres long section of the beach.

A Royal Navy bomb squad from Plymouth, Devon, arrived in the afternoon, moved the grenade to an isolated part of the beach and blew it up.

A Dorset police spokesman said the grenade was 'very old and heavily corroded'.

It is likely it originated from a huge D-Day training exercise that took part in April 1944 two miles away on the shoreline at Studland, Dorset.
