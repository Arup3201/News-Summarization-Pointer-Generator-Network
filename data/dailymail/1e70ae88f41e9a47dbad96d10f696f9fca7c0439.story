A creepy website has collected streaming footage from more than 73,000 cameras around the globe that are connected to the internet, because the owners haven't changed their default passwords, making them accessible to virtually anyone.

Insecam claims to feature feeds from IP cameras all over the world with more than 11,000 in the U.S. and 2,400 in the UK alone. 

Some of the shots are harmless with fly-on-the-wall views of stores, offices and parking lots, but there are also far more personal areas covered by the cameras, with living rooms and bedrooms featured prominently. 

Many of the cameras are being used as babycams which will alert many parents.  

Creepy: The website insecam.com is running footage from more than 73,000 cameras round the world including this kitchen

Disturbing: Security experts say members of the internet need to beware of the pitfalls of the internet. This camera is positioned over a baby's crib but the adults bed can be clearly seen

Watching over you: This baby's crib is on full view to the world. The owners of the cameras have no idea that their footage is being streamed for anyone to see online

Open door: The site is streaming cameras which have not had their factory passwords changed

'This site has been designed in order to show the importance of the security settings,' the site proclaims on its page.

Although the feeds are something that anyone with a bit of determination could find through Google, for example, the website makes accessing the streams far easier by pooling them together onto a single website.

It makes it extremely easy to peer into hundreds of strangers bedrooms with just a click of the mouse.

On location: The cameras are located in businesses, factories, building sites and private homes

Living in your living room: No password is required to access the security camera streams

Peeping Tom paradise: The website makes it easy to pick from one of 73,000 different camera streams

You are not alone: Does the person relaxing on the couch realize they're being watched?

There are 40,746 feeds from unsecured cameras in the top 10 countries that are listed: 

11,046 in the U.S.

6,536 in South Korea

4,770 in China

3,359 in Mexico

3,285 in France

2,870 in Italy

2,422 in the U.K

2,268 in the Netherlands

2,220 in Columbia 

1,970 in India

One lawyer noted that looking at someones camera would be a violation of the  Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in the United States as it involves hacking into someone's password-protected account - even if that password is the default setting.

It is easy to have your private camera taken off the  Insecam site, simply by setting a new password removes it from view. 

There are 40,746 pages of unsecured cameras just in the first 10 country listings: 11,046 in the U.S.; 6,536 in South Korea; 4,770 in China; 3,359 in Mexico; 3,285 in France; 2,870 in Italy; 2,422 in the U.K.; 2,268 in the Netherlands; 2,220 in Columbia; and 1,970 in India. 

The site states, 'you can see into bedrooms of all countries of the world.'

Further details are also listed with the site displaying information including the camera manufacturer, default login and password, time zone, city and state. 

The approximate location is also pinpointed on Google Maps giving any potential peeping Tom a very real insight into your supposedly private world.

Internet protocol cameras, or IP cameras, are the ones being streamed on the website and they are seen as a cheaper option than CCTV camera systems.

Security: Owners must set strong passwords on security cameras unless they want to give the whole world a free pass to watch inside their homes

Extra cheese? You could easily watch your pizza being made with a live feed inside this branch of Dominoes

A top security expert says the website is a good thing 'to alert people to the dark side of the internet'.

James Der Derian, Director of the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney, told MailOnline: 'Everyone thinks the internet is this perfect way of communicating. 

'The whole idea of the internet is a way of access and unless you have very strong password protection and encryption then this kind of exposure is inevitable.  

'This shows that it has got a flip side and people uploading personal details need to be careful, this website is an example of that. 

'It does not surprise me and it is a good thing to alert people to the darker side of the internet. People are so willing to give up personal information.'
