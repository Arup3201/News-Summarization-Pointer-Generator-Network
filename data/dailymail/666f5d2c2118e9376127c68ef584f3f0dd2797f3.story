Newcastle United look set to be without Mehdi Abeid for the majority of January after the midfielder was called into Algeria's squad for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations.

The 22-year-old is currently out injured after breaking his toe while on international duty last month and is a doubt for the Magpies this week.

He could miss Newcastle's Capital One Cup quarter-final at White Hart Lane against Spurs on Wednesday and the Tyne-Wear derby against Sunderland at St James' Park on Sunday through injury.

January 31 - Hull City (A)

February 7 - Stoke City (H)

February 10 - Crystal Palace (A)

But it seems certain Abeid will not feature throughout the majority of January after being named as the only uncapped player in Algeria's 23-man squad for the tournament.

Depending on how well Algeria do in the tournament, Abeid could miss between one and five games for the Magpies. 

The midfielder only broke into Alan Pardew's first-team side earlier this season but after a series of magnificent displays - including a stellar performance against Manchester City at the Etihad in Newcastle's 2-0 victory at the end of October - he has become an integral part of the Magpies' midfield.

Abeid has established himself in the Newcastle first team although he is currently out injured

But injury has restricted Abeid to just three Premier League appearances in all. 

Tottenham Hotspur's Nabil Bentaleb and Leicester City's Riyad Mahrez are the only other Premier League-based players in Algeria's squad for the tournament in Equatorial Guinea, although Watford's Adle Guedioura is on the reserve list.

Algeria face South Africa, Ghana and Senegal in their group.

The tournament begins on January 17 and the final takes place on February 8
