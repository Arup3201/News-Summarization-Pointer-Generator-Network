Deaths from cuts and grazes, diarrhoea and flu will soon be common as antibiotics lose their power to fight minor infections, experts have warned.

The World Health Organisation says the problem has been caused by antibiotics being so widely prescribed that bacteria have begun to evolve and develop resistance.

It claims the crisis is worse than the Aids epidemic – which has caused 25million deaths worldwide – and threatens to turn the clock back on modern medicine.

Antibiotic resistance needs to be taken as seriously as AIDS was in the 1980s, experts say

The WHO warns that the public should 
‘anticipate many more deaths’ as it may become routine for children to 
develop lethal infections from minor grazes, while hospital operations 
become deadly as patients are at risk of developing infections that were
 previously treatable.

Doctors
 are increasingly finding that antibiotics no longer work against 
urinary and skin infections, tuberculosis and gonorrhoea.

The
 WHO is urging the public to take simple precautions, such as washing 
hands to prevent bacteria from spreading in the first place.

Doctors
 are also being told to prescribe antibiotics sparingly and ensure 
patients finish the full course, as if they stop mid-way the bacteria 
may become resistant. In England last year some 41.7million 
prescriptions were written out, up from 37.2million in 2006.

MRSA - Patients infected with MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) are 64 per cent more likely to die than those with a non-resistant form of S. aureus. People infected by resistant superbugs are also likely to stay longer in hospital and may need intensive care, pushing up costs.C. difficile - This bacteria produces spores that are resistant to high temperatures and are very difficult to eliminate. It is spread through contaminated food and objects and can cause blood poisoning and tears in the large intestine.

E. coli - this now accounts for one 
in three cases of bacterial infections in the blood in the UK and a new 
strain is resistant to most antibiotics. It is highly contagious and 
could cause more than 3,000 deaths a year.

Acinetobacter Baumannii - a common bacteria which is resistant to most antibiotics and which can easily infect patients in a hospital. It can cause meningitis and is fatal in about 80 per cent of patients.CRKP - this is a bacterium that is associated with extremely difficult to treat blood infections and meningitis. It is resistant to nearly all antibiotics and is fatal in 50 per cent of cases.Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis is estimated to kill 150,000 people globally each year.

NDM-1 - a bacteria detected in India of which some strains are resistant to all antibiotics.

Dr
 Keiji Fukuda, the WHO’s assistant director for health security, said: 
‘Without urgent, co-ordinated action, the world is headed for a 
post-antibiotic era, in which common infections and minor injuries which
 have been treatable for decades can once again kill.

‘Effective
 antibiotics have been one of the pillars allowing us to live longer, 
live healthier, and benefit from modern medicine.

‘Unless
 we take significant actions to improve efforts to prevent infections, 
and also change how we produce, prescribe and use antibiotics, the world
 will lose more and more of these global public health goods and the 
implications will be devastating.

‘We should anticipate to see many more deaths.

‘We are going to see people who have untreatable infections.’

Only
 last month, Britain’s chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies 
criticised GPs for needlessly ‘dishing out’ antibiotics to patients.

In
 the largest study of its kind, the WHO looked at data from 114 
countries on seven major types of bacteria. Experts are particularly 
concerned about bacteria responsible for pneumonia, urinary tract 
infections, skin infections, diarrhoea and gonorrhoea.

They are also 
worried that antiviral medicines are becoming increasingly less 
effective against flu.

Dr 
Danilo Lo Fo Wong, a senior adviser at the WHO, said: ‘A child falling 
off their bike and developing a fatal infection would be a freak 
occurrence in the UK, but that is where we are heading.’

British
 experts likened the problem to the Aids epidemic of the 1980s. 
Professor Laura Piddock, who specialises in microbiology at the 
University of Birmingham, said: ‘The world needs to respond as it did to
 the Aids crisis.

‘We 
still need a better understanding of all aspects of resistance as well 
as new discovery, research and development of new antibiotics.’

The
 first antibiotic, penicillin, was developed by Sir Alexander Fleming in
 1929. But their use has soared since the 1960s, and in 1998 the 
Government issued guidelines to doctors urging them to curb 
prescriptions. Nonetheless, surveys suggest they are still prescribed 
for 80 per cent of coughs, colds and sore throats.

The spread of deadly superbugs that evade even the most powerful antibiotics is happening across the world, United Nations officials have confirmed. Image shows the superbug MRSA which already kills almost 20,000 people a year in Europe

The human cost of the rising number of superbugs is becoming all too familiar.

Distraught young couple Jenna and Andrew Hannon lost their second son to an infection at a hospital neo-natal unit in Bristol.

Little Oliver was born early at 24 weeks and although he had seemed well enough to go home with his parents, he soon fell dangerously ill.

He was taken to Southmead Hospital but the infection had taken hold and the youngster passed away.

Tragically the couple had lost another prematurely born son, Travis, to infection in 2010, just five-and-a-half hours after his birth at 26 weeks.

An inquest into Oliver's death later found he had been killed by the pseudomonas bacteria.

He was one of three babies in the hospital to be hit by the killer bacteria, which was later linked to baby deaths around the country.

An investigation took place at the hospital into Oliver's death, but it could not find what caused his infection.

The inquest was told that Oliver was being given two types of antibiotics before he died as a precaution, but neither specifically fought pseudomonas.

As a result of the investigation the hospital also now uses antibiotics which more specifically target the bacteria.

Jennifer Cohn of the international medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières agreed with the WHO's assessment and confirmed the problem had spread to many corners of the world.

'We see horrendous rates of antibiotic resistance wherever we look in our field operations, including children admitted to nutritional centres in Niger, and people in our surgical and trauma units in Syria,' she said.

Earlier this month, Government body NICE said that one in 16 patients are developing infections on NHS wards because of poor hygiene among staff.

NICE said 800 patients a day, the equivalent of 300,000 a year, are infected by a member of staff or by dirty equipment. It is estimated the infections cause 5,000 deaths annually and contribute to another 15,000.

Antibiotics are substances that kill or interfere with the growth of microorganisms, especially bacteria. But not all microorganisms are susceptible to all antibiotics, according to Public Health England.

Microorganisms which are not killed or inhibited by an antibiotic are called 'antibiotic resistant'.

They continue to grow and multiply in the presence of that antibiotics.

There are several ways in which bacteria can be resistant. Some destroy the antibiotic, for example by producing enzymes against it; some prevent the antibiotic getting into their cells; others get the antibiotic out of their cells before it can harm them.

HOW DOES RESISTANCE DEVELOP?

Some bacteria are naturally resistant; new resistances also arise spontaneously by chance mutations and these resistant strains then multiply.

Some resistances can be passed from one bacterium to another, spreading resistance between species. Loops of DNA (called plasmids) carry the resistance genes from one bacterium to another.

When an antibiotic is given, it kills the sensitive bacteria, but any resistant ones can survive and multiply.

The more antibiotics are used (in animals and agriculture as well as in man) the greater will be the "selective pressure", favouring resistant strains - i.e. survival of the fittest.

Antibiotics don't 'cause' resistance; rather, they create an environment which favours the growth of resistant varians which already exist in nature or arise by chance.
