A Michigan mother of four children and enthusiastic writer of a popular housewife blog, was shot dead by her ex-husband, alongside her 14-year-old son, because he refused to accept their marriage was over.

Christine Keith, 37, lost her life along with her teenage son Isaac Miller,14, after Randy Keith, 53, blasted them with one of his hunting rifles. After committing the murders, Keith then turned the gun on himself.

The three were found dead at their home in Lansing, Michigan, on Thursday night and police confirmed Keith as the shooter.

Caring: Christine was a mother of four who was heavily involved in her community

'It seems surreal, you just don't think this is going to happen to someone that you know who is a wonderful human being and contributes so much to the world,' said Melissa Quon Huber, a family friend of Christine told WILX.

A well as bringing up four children, Christine was heavily involved in her community teaching Zumba classes across the city.

She was also an avid writer and kept a popular blog: 'Adventures of a Thrifty Mama...' which discussed how she was working to feed her family on a tight budget using only fresh, homemade ingredients.

Family and friends who knew Christine and her family say they knew she had dealt with domestic abuse in the past and dreaded something like this would ultimately happen.

My understanding is that she was very firm, and had basically told him they were done,' said attorney Steve Cornish, who represented Christine, told the Times Herald.

'I had very grave concerns for her safety, but I don’t think I expected something this extreme,”

'I was shocked but not surprised,' said friend Cheryl Overley. 'It's part of the cycle of violence. For people who see this and are moved by the story of people who died before their time... I hope they learn about (domestic violence) and start discussions.'

Numerous times in recent years, Randy Keith reportedly threatened to kill his wife if she ever left him, court documents say.

'Threats of shooting me to death with one of his hunting rifles were par for the course,' Christine Keith wrote in a petition for a personal protection order filed in April in Ingham County Circuit Court.

Sadly she later withdrew that order.

Violent past: Christine Keith wrote had filed a petition for a personal protection order against her estranged husband Randy Keith

In her first divorce filing, as well as 
in the personal protection order, Christine Keith outlined what she said
was her husband’s controlling, erratic and sometimes violent 
behavior. The couple were married in 2003 but just five years later they 
were filing for divorce.

Police were called to their Jackson-area home after Randy pushed Christine to the floor, knocking her unconscious briefly.

Christine said they had fought over his refusal to watch the children.

In her petition for the personal protection order, Christine said that 
in 2011, they were living in a trailer in Webberville, and Randy was 
fired from his job and didn’t work for a year.

'I had to walk on eggshells not to trigger his abuse,' she wrote, noting that she had been diagnosed with depression and believed Randy also was depressed. '(He) stayed in bed for nearly the entire year, only rarely getting up other than to use the bathroom... At least once a week, he told me if I ever left him he would kill me.'

Christine said she kept an old cell phone in the house, and told their children they could use it to call 911.

She also said Randy was suicidal. In 2012, she said she was concerned he would hunt for his limit of deer and then kill himself.

'I need to be safe from Randy,' she wrote in the petition filed April 8. 'Based on Randy’s consistent pattern of action, once he’s released…I will not be safe.'

Anger problems: Randy Keith was insecure and possessive over his wife. When she wanted a divorce, he wouldn't allow it. When it finally went through the courts he blasted her and he son with one of his hunting rifles

In October — for the second time this year — the 37-year-old Lansing woman filed for divorce. The new divorce case was proceeding toward becoming final, her attorney said. She dropped the initial divorce case in May.

The Keiths had three other children 8, 6 and 4-years-old who were not home at the time of the shooting.

The local church is to start a fund to help Christine's three surviving children as their entire community tries to move forward and cope.

Happier times: The couple were married in 2003. They had three children together, ages 8, 6 and 4, who are now orphaned

Callous: Randy Keith shot both victims before taking his own life a short time later, according to police

'There was always that possibility when you have someone in your past who has a tendency to be jealous or vindictive,' Huber said.

'It can happen to smart women, rich women, poor women, it doesn't take anything to be a victim of domestic violence.'

Christine's three remaining children are staying with their grandparents.

The family's church, Unitarian Universalist Church of Greater Lansing has set up a memorial fund for the children which can be donated to by following the link to the right.
