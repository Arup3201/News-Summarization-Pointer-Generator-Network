Trouble has erupted hours before the start of the Euro 2012 football tournament, with local thugs attacking English-speaking fans and hurling racist abuse at star players.

About 50 hooligans punched and kicked foreign football fans speaking English and Russian as they drank in a pub in the central Polish city of Lodz.

The fighting broke out after Dutch players complained they were subjected to monkey chants while training in another Polish city, where the England team is based.

Fears are growing that the tournament, which starts today, could be ruined by neo-Nazi rioters in host countries Poland and Ukraine.

The captain of the Holland squad, Mark van Bommel, claimed that thugs hurled vile insults at his black team-mates as they trained in Krakow.

Manchester United player Rio Ferdinand, who was omitted from the England squad, responded to van Bommel's claims on Twitter, writing: 'Tell me I didn’t see this ... the Dutch team getting abuse already? Hope this isn’t a sign of things to come'.

And Britain's sports minister Hugh Robertson called on authorities at the tournament to 'stamp down' on any racist abuse.

'Racism of any form is unacceptable on the football pitch or elsewhere,' he told the Evening Standard.

Shocked: Rio Ferdinand wrote on Twitter that he hoped the abuse of Dutch players was not 'a sign of things to come'

'If it occurs I would expect the authorities to stamp down on it in the strongest possible terms.'

Mr Robertson would not comment on the Dutch incident, which comes after pictures emerged of machetes and other knives confiscated from Polish fans by police.

The families of two black England players, Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, have decided not to travel to the competition because they feared abuse from violent and racist fans.

Witnesses to the violence said masked men pulled up in cars next to a pub and attacked anyone in sight, throwing punches and kicks.

The attackers were described as young men wearing club colours of local team LKS Lodz.

'When they started to hit out, we fled inside,' one victim said. 'We barricaded the entrance.

'Some of us remained outside, and they got the brunt of the attack.'

Two men were injured in the attack, which happened last night.

'They forced two younger men to the ground, with multiple attackers starting to punch and kick them,' a Polish witness said.

'It was a horrible sight. I fumbled for my phone and called the police.

'They were lying motionless on the pavement. I thought they were dead.

'After a couple of minutes, one of them started to get up, and then the second. I was very relieved.'

The thugs appeared to target foreigners, and the owner of the pub refused to press charges out of fear for retaliation attacks.

Before the incident, the visitors were reported to be talking and chanting in English and Russian.

No English nationals were involved in the violence.

The fighting followed a race row involving the Dutch team who, like England and Italy's players are training in Krakow.

Kicking off: Violence and racism are already problems in Poland, where football fans are gathering for the start of Euro 2012

Witnesses said Holland's footballers were racially abused by about 500 fans of Wisla Krakow, whose stadium is being used by national teams for training sessions.

The insults began when the squad went on a two-lap jog around the pitch. The abuse was said to have been even louder on the players' second circuit.

Poland's feared SWAT-style public order police squad are on high alert for rioters and thugs at Euro 2012.

The elite GROM - translated as Lightning Squad - have been rehearsing anti-riot tactics and simulated hostage rescues for weeks before.

Snipers on building roofs and elite officers from Poland's notorious Riot Squad and Anti-Terrorist Unit will back up the GROM officers, who wear all black.

Police are equipped with portable tear gas machines, pump action shotguns with plastic baton rounds.

They have been given handguns with live 9mm rounds, handcuffs, pepper spray, body armour, helmets and shields.

They will also carry special pistols firing red dye capsules so rioters who get away can be identified later.

All the units have carried out terrifying public shows of strength with live training assaults on buses and simulated riots.

The ruthless reputation of the riot police is a hangover from Poland's communist days when they were used to viciously suppress democracy campaigners and described as the 'beating heart of the state'.

Dutch captain Mark van Bommel 
responded by telling his team-mates to pick up their kit and move to the
 other end of the pitch to continue their warm-up.

He warned that his players will walk off the pitch if the team is targeted by racists during the competition.

The incident happened only a day after the Holland squad visited the nearby former Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz.

Van Bommel said: ‘It is a real disgrace, especially after getting back from Auschwitz to be confronted with this.

‘We will take it up with (European football's governing body) UEFA and, if it happens at matches, we will talk to the referee and ask him to take us off the field.’

In a press conference with Dutch media, some of whom did not report the chanting, the captain said: ‘You need to open your ears.

‘If you did hear it and you don’t want to hear it, that’s even worse.’

Van
 Bommel was supported by the Dutch coach Bert van Marwijk, who said: ‘At
 least now we know what we can encounter here,’ before adding 
sarcastically: ‘Very atmospheric.’

The England team is scheduled to hold a 'ticketed' session for around 3,500 fans at a stadium in Krakow today.

UEFA issued a statement, which read: 'UEFA has now been made aware that there were some isolated incidents of racist chanting.'

Van Bommel's Holland teammate Ibrahim Afellay told De Telegraaf newspaper that the jeers had 'saddened him'.

However, the Dutch federation said it did not file a complaint to UEFA.

UEFA president Michel Platini has said any player who walks off the pitch during a match without the referee's authority can expect a yellow card.

'It is a referee's job to stop the match and he is to do so if there are any problems of this kind,' Platini said.

'I count on the fans from Western and Eastern Europe to come to participate in a great football feast.'

Abuse: The Dutch football team were subjected to monkey chants as they trained in Krakow

Targeted: Witnesses said Holland's footballers were racially abused by about 500 fans of Wisla Krakow, whose stadium is being used by national teams for training sessions

'If I am here as a UEFA chairman and you all are here it is because we want this to be a football feast, not a problem.'

Platini confirmed that referees had been instructed to halt matches if a player is taunted with racist chants.

He
 was responding to threats made by the black Manchester City and Italy 
striker Mario Balotelli, who said he would leave the field if he was 
abused.

The sole black player on the Czech Republic's team, Theodor Gebre Selassie, said he hoped racism would not flare up in the stadiums.

'We don't know yet what the situation will be like at the stadiums,' he said, adding that he would not walk off the field.

'I'm not ready to give up. I definitely won't leave. I'll stay until they throw stones at me.'

Former Arsenal and 
England defender Sol Campbell last week told supporters to stay away 
from the tournament because of the danger of racism and violence.

A photograph depicting knives confiscated from Polish football hooligans has been removed from the article after we were informed that the photograph was taken in 2010 and was unrelated to Euro 2012. the article has also been amended to make it clearer to the reader that the images of the Polish police were taken during an operation ahead of the tournament.
