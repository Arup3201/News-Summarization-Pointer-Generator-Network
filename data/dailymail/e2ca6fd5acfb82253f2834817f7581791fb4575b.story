The Greek government has proposed hiring tourists to help uncover tax dodging businesses in holiday resorts as part of its efforts to rescue the country’s shattered finances.

Holidaymakers could be recruited alongside students and housewives to form an army of so-called ‘onlookers’ carrying hidden cameras and recorders to catch tax dodgers.

The plan, which met with immediate mockery from critics, emerged in a leaked letter sent by Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis to the President of the Eurogroup Jeroen Dijsselbloem, which outlines a range of reforms for the Greek economy.

In the letter Essex-University educated Varoufakis said: ‘The culture of tax avoidance runs deep within Greek society.’

Arguing that tax authorities were overstretched, he suggests hiring ‘large numbers of non-professional inspectors’ to spread fear among tax-avoiders.

The plan would involve basic training for the amateur tax sleuths who would be ‘wired for sound and video.’

The inspectors, who would operate across the country with tourists most suitable for spying on resort areas, would not be able to confront tax dodgers or have any authority to carry out checks but the evidence they collected could be used in prosecutions.

The inspectors would be hired for a maximum of two months and would not be re-hired.

Varoufakis, finance minister of the new left-wing Syriza government in Greece, claims the move would create a new climate in the country.

‘The very news that thousands of casual ‘onlookers’ are everywhere, bearing audio and video recording equipment on behalf of the tax authorities, has the capacity to shift attitudes very quickly spreading a sense of justice across society and engendering a new tax compliance culture,’ Varoufakis writes in his letter.

The idea however has met with derision from some quarters with one unnamed European official quoted as saying the plan was ‘hilarious’.

The letter is the Greek Government’s detailed response to a request from its European partners to provide a list of reforms for its economy, a promise agreed by Varoufakis last month in return for an extension of its current bail-out pending further talks.

The tax spy proposal is one of seven reforms proposed by Varoufakis, which will be considered by Eurozone finance ministers on Monday.

Other measures include taxing gambling, improving existing budget and tax collecting systems and creating a Fiscal Council which would act as an independent overseer of state spending.

Laws to create the Fiscal Council were passed by the previous Greek Government but have yet to be put into practice.
