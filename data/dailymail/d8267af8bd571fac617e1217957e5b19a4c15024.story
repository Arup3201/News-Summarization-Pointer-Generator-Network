One of Britain’s best known track and field stars is reportedly named on a list of 150 athletes from around the world who had suspicious blood values that were covered up.

The allegation was made in the third part of the German documentary that has exposed serial doping in Russia which is being treated by the IAAF ruling body as a highly serious issue for the sport with investigations into the TV allegations being carried out by the IAAF ethics committee, anti-doping body WADA and the IOC.

German TV station ARD have alleged evidence from an unnamed whistleblower in the IAAF Medical Commission that the alleged cover-up of drugs cheats went far beyond the boundaries of Russia. 

One of Britain’s best known track and field stars is reportedly named on a list of 150 athletes from around the world who had suspicious blood values that were covered up

IAAF vice-president Sebastian Coe said on Monday he believes athletics' reputation is damaged by doping cases involving a small number of countries

The information about the British involvement came from ARD’s whistleblower from within the IAAF Medical Commission. His evidence alleged that the protection of possible drugs cheats by the IAAF went far beyond Russia. The list — seen by Sportsmail — was compiled between 2006 and 2008 before the advent of blood passports that have greatly helped in the battle to beat the dopers.

It contains names of Russian athletes but also others from Ukraine, Greece, Bulgaria, Spain, Morocco, Kenya and Germany as well as the UK trio.

The star British name was on the highest colour red tier of suspicion for blood counts HCT and HGB — so should have automatically been target tested for the blood-boosting drug EPO. But ARD’s IAAF insider says the necessary follow-up tests were not done at that time. And if so, very sparingly.

Journalist Hajo Seppelt, who made the ARD documentary, said: ‘I trust the source of these documents 100 per cent. They are genuine.’

A spokesperson for the British star was made aware of the exact allegations but was not available for comment.

Dick Pound, the former president of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), has lambasted the IAAF for not acting on allegations of systematic Russian doping

The IAAF claimed that a single blood reading is not definitive and their medical staff would not necessarily know if a target test had taken place. A rebuttal statement said: ‘The blood data collected before (2009) was used for target purposes to trigger follow up urine tests for EPO detection. Abnormal results were followed up whenever possible. One cannot draw any conclusion on whether or not an athlete has doped on the basis of one single blood value.

‘When they are available, the IAAF has used pre-2009 blood values as secondary evidence. However these values do not have the same reliability and strength as samples collected under strict conditions.

‘The IAAF has been using the pre-2009 blood data to identify countries where there was a high risk of doping and to adjust its doping control programme accordingly.’

The documentaries have been sent to the IAAF’s independent ethics committee who are already investigating other whistleblower evidence of systematic Russian doping that was also covered up.

The IAAF also have to deal with further allegations about IAAF President Lamine Diack’s son Papa Massata, a marketing consultant for the organisation, around Doha’s failed bid to host the 2017 World Championships.

This comes after London 2012 chief Lord Sebastian Coe claimed athletics' reputation is being disproportionately damaged by doping cases involving a small number of countries.

Lord Coe, an IAAF vice-president who is standing in next August's election to be the organisation's president, called the allegations 'very serious' and promised any investigation into them will be completely independent.

'This is not in every country of the world - there are 213 federations,' he said. 'But you do have to say a disproportionate amount of the reputational damage is in a relatively small number of countries, and I think we have to recognise this.

'They are very serious allegations. The very fact that the allegations are in the public domain means that they are serious. So, we have to be very clear that this is a very, very difficult time for our sport.'
