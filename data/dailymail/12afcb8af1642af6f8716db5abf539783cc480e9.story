Sunderland have asked about taking Liverpool defender Sebastian Coates on loan.

The 23-year-old centre-back is keen to move away from Anfield and spent last season on loan at Nacional.

Sunderland are looking at loans to strengthen their defence as they push the bulk of their spending budget towards bringing in a striker.

In the Red! Sebastian Coates has emerged as a surprise target for Sunderland

They have a £14m bid on the table for Coates' teammate Fabio Borini and have enquired about Manchester United's Danny Welbeck. Meanwhile, manager Gus Poyet has called for his side to repeat last season's unexpected victory over Manchester United when the two teams meet on Sunday. 

'There is always the possibility of a miracle or something unique because of the way we play in England, and that makes it really special. It’s the scenario where everyone can beat anyone else.

‘When Van Gaal was at Barcelona, it was very, very difficult for a bottom team to go to the Nou Camp and beat Barcelona. It happened once every 10 years.

Will he won't he? Black Cats are still chasing a £14m move for Liverpool striker Fabio Borini

‘But we talk about those unique games every season in England, where there is a shock result.

‘That makes this league so special and attractive to everyone around the world.’
