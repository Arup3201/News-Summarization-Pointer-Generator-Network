Global retail giant Wal-Mart has recalled a donkey meat product from some Chinese stores after tests found it contained the DNA of other animals including fox.

The world's largest retailer will reimburse customers who bought the 'Five Spice Donkey Meat' 50 yuan (around £5), a spokeswoman for the U.S. company said.

The company said it would independently DNA test all of its 'high-risk' meats in China, a procedure which is not required by retailers under Chinese food laws, the spokeswoman said.

Wal-Mart would also co-operate with food officials in the eastern province of Shandong with their probe into the 'adulteration incident', said a statement posted on Sina Weibo, a Chinese Twitter equivalent.

The Shandong Food and Drug Administration had previously said the 'Five Spice Donkey Meat' product contained fox, but it is not clear what other animals were found.

'We are deeply sorry for this whole affair,' said Wal-Mart's China president and CEO Greg Foran according to the Weibo statement, posted Wednesday.

It did not give an explanation for how 
the contamination happened, but Foran added that the company would 
increase its focus on 'supplier management'.

The Wal-Mart spokeswoman told the Wall Street Journal that the donkey meat is sold in only two stores in Jinan, the capital of Shandong.

She said the firm may take legal action against its supplier.

Donkey meat is not a Chinese staple meat dish, but is commonly consumed as a snack.

China has seen several food safety scares in recent years, including one in which the industrial chemical melamine was added to milk formula in 2008, killing at least six babies and making 300,000 ill.

Wal-Mart plans to open up to 110 new stores in China over the next two years, according to the company's website.
