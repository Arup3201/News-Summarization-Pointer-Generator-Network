From baby products to clothes and commemorative mugs, the royal birth has generated a flood of souvenirs to mark the special occasion.

And while some of the gifts border on the tacky, St Jame's Palace have said the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have welcomed the memorabilia as part of the celebrations of their first born.

'The birth of the Duke and Duchess’s baby should be a 
joyous occasion, and we recognise there is a long and happy history of 
people producing souvenirs to mark Royal occasions,' a spokesman from the palace told the Daily Telegraph.

Since Kate's pregnancy was announced last year, there has already been a plethora of products on the market marking the occasion from mugs and tea towels to baby grows and books.

And once the baby is born this month and the sex and name is announced, even more related souvenirs will go on sale. 

The most desirable pieces are likely to be the ceramic cups, dishes and bowls which will vary from the cheap and cheerful to gold leaf-covered fine bone china creations costing hundreds of pounds.

Stoke-on-Trent, the home of England's pottery industry, is a hive of activity as companies gear up for the big day, expected in mid-July.

Designs have been drawn up and potters are waiting for the moment William and Kate's baby is born and named.

Dr Laura Cohen, chief executive of the British Ceramic Confederation, highlighted how foreign collectors, especially from countries such as America and Japan, prize items from the UK.

She said: 'This will be a welcome boost for UK tableware and giftware manufacturers, generating significant sales for many companies in the UK and overseas.

'UK manufacturers are uniquely placed to commence manufacturing as soon as the baby's name is announced and so respond rapidly to orders.

'Many customers value the 'Made in England' backstamp on cherished family items such as these marking royal occasions.

Children's stores including Mothercare and Jo Jo Maman Bébé are also getting in on the act with their own 'royal collection' of clothing from maternity wear with the slogan 'future princess' to baby grows covered in crowns.

Simon Calver, Mothercare chief executive, said they were not trying to 'cash in' with their range of prince and princess clothing.

'We're looking to commerate, celebrate, to 
have a bit of fun. Babies are going to be the thing people talk about 
this year,' he told the Telegraph.

Meanwhile Fisher Price have released a 'royal' potty to help toddlers toilet train on a 'throne' of their own.

The memorabilia to mark the royal birth will be led by the official range produced by the Royal Collection Trust.

In recent years, the organisation has produced high-quality bone china items to mark historic moments for the monarchy.

A spokeswoman for the trust said: 'Royal Collection Trust has produced a number of commemorative china ranges to celebrate royal anniversaries and events, most recently for the royal wedding, the Diamond Jubilee, and the anniversary of the coronation in 2013.

'An official range to celebrate the birth of a future monarch would be made, but not until after the event.'

If the trust follows its past ranges, it will probably produce a collection of items to commemorate the baby, who will be third in line to the throne.

These could include a coffee mug, tankard, pillbox and plate decorated with a floral pattern or even heraldic creatures.

The pieces are likely to feature the individual cyphers of the Duke and Duchess - their initials, W or C, below a coronet - the baby's name and date it was born.

In past years, members of the monarchy have approved designs before they have gone into production, so William and Kate are likely to have already cast an eye over the plans.

If you don't have a baby to dress up like a prince or princess nor want to have your next cup of tea from a mug celebrating the royal birth, you can still join in the fun when you enjoy a treat thanks to Krispy Kreme.

The Duchess is said to have bought a Bugaboo Buggy Cameleon pram

From the name they choose to whether they give their baby a dummy, the Duke and Duchess' parenting choices are set to be followed by new parents around the country.

Claire Irvin, editor-in-chief of Bauer Media's parenting portfolio which includes Mother & Baby magazine, predicts any baby product Kate is seen using - that is likely to be from the British High Street - will quickly sell out. She also believes the couple could spark new interest in eco-parenting.

She said: 'Kate's really supported the British high street. They'll carry on what they started. They do seem to like to give the impression of being very grounded.

'We think she could spearhead a return to eco buys given Prince Charles' stance on the environment. Eco products took a bit of a hit with the recession when people wanted cost-effectiveness.'

She added: 'If they use a dummy, it will send sales of dummies through the roof and vice-versa if they don't.'

The buggy Kate is seen pushing will also become a must-have with new mothers. It is thought she has bought a trendy Bugaboo pram, priced at around £869.
