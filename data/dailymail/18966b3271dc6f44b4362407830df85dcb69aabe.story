With this distinctive 'Braveheart' tattoo emblazoned across his face, you can bet it won't be long before police in Columbus, Ohio, are taking this suspected crook's freedom.

Christopher Peters, 21, has been singled out by local prosecutors as an example of the city's problem with habitual shoplifters, who are costing retailers more than ever before.

Dubbed the 'Braveheart Bandit' because of the blue tattoo slashing his face from his forehead to his right cheek, Peters was caught stealing eight times in 2014.

And he has three outstanding warrants out for his arrest, Central Ohio's 10TV reports.

You can take my freedom, but you'll never take my silly tattoo: 'Braveheart Bandit' Christopher Peters, 21, has been singled out by prosecutors in Columbus, Ohio, as an example of the city's problem with shoplifters

Assistant Columbus Attorney Bill Hedrick told the broadcaster: 'I would call a professional shoplifter who chooses to get a blue triangle tattooed across his face stupid rather than brave, but we believe he was going for the William Wallace Braveheart look.'

Peters stole at least $322-worth of goods from Home Depot in March, and in April a $380 vacuum cleaner from Anderson's and a $849 Dyson vacuum cleaner from Target.

That month he also stole £220-worth of clothes from Old Navy.

Peters was convicted but has apparently not been deterred; prosecutors say he's stealing again and they are on the hunt for him. They don't think he will be able to hide for long

'Mr Peters should be easy to identify so we are hoping the public can help us track him down,' Mr Hedrick said.

Four out of five cases of theft last year involved repeat offenders like Peters, the Columbus city attorney's office said. And while the number of theft charges was down slightly on the year before, the average value of each theft was up 7 per cent, from $128 to $137.

Thieves are often targeting high value items like Dyson vacuum cleaners, baby formula, Tide, Red Bull and meat, which can be resold for cash to other stores or online.

Prosecutors are urging judges to increase thieves' sentences or give them longer periods on probation, but as long as crooks steal less than $1,000-worth of goods it's still a misdemeanour.

Peters is also a registered sex offender and wanted for failing to re-verify his address.
