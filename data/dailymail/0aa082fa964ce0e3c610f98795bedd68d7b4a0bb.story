Not since Jurgen Klinsmann swallow-dived his way into Premier League history 20 years ago has a foreign striker made quite such an impressive entrance into English football as Diego Costa. It is not just the goal record, which is extraordinary — with a hat-trick and seven goals in four games.

As with Klinsmann, whose scored seven in his first six games, it is the sheer force of personality of the player that has enthralled English audiences. Klinsmann's charisma became evident with that self-parodying celebration, diving to mock his reputation for going to ground easily. 

With Diego Costa, who faces the biggest test of his short Premier League career on Saturday against champions Manchester City, it is his clear relish for the physical battle that has made such an impact.

Plenty of wonderful players have needed time to adjust to the confrontational ways of English football before demonstrating their best; Dennis Bergkamp, Thierry Henry and Robert Pires would all fit into that category. 

By contrast, Costa, originally Brazilian but a naturalised Spaniard, looks like he was born to play in England. Defenders might look to be provoke or unsettle him — he has already been involved in spats with Everton's Seamus Coleman and Tim Howard — but Costa genuinely doesn't seem to care or even notice. 

'The reality is, for the moment, I haven't had any really physical battles,' he said, when asked about that side of the League. 'Things have been going well. So far, I'm enjoying it.' The provocations? 'That happens here, it happened in Spain. 

'Wherever I play, it'll always be like that. It's a perception people have of my character and people will look for any way to try to take advantage of it. 

'They go looking for it. You've got to know how to manage these situations. The truth is I'm fairly relaxed. If they provoke me, I'll score against them!' 

Clearly Saturday's test against Vincent Kompany will be the severest yet, with Costa's manager Jose Mourinho conceding that playing him with a hamstring problem is a risk.

But Costa seems to be a fighter by nature. You suspected as much when he took on John Terry in the first leg of Atletico's Champions League semi-final clash last season, simply staring straight back at him as they squared up.

Then, in the return leg, he gave as good as he got to Ramires and Branislav Ivanovic as they reprimanded him for taking an age to place the ball for his penalty, which he duly scored, effectively ending Chelsea's participation in the competition. All this at a time when it was fairly clear he would be moving to Stamford Bridge. Even his friends say he is a little crazy.

'Well, I don't like to lose, I think that gets noticed,' said Costa. 'It's something that many times goes well but other times goes badly for me.

'I'm just like that, I just always try to win, to get better, do my best and it always annoys me to lose. 'I think anyone in life, everyone in the world, no matter what work they do, should think of wanting to get on, to win, to improve.

'I don't think I am the type of person who thinks: 'Things are getting on top of me.' But it's not that I think I'm any different to most people. I always fight with all my strength, make the best of a situation.' 

Hard to believe now, but Costa was ignored by Brazilian clubs and was playing street football without a team until he was 16.

Costa has emerged from Aguero's shadow, and will line up against the Man City striker at the Etihad on Sunday

He was briefly at Barcelona Esportivo Capela, a club in the local reaches of Sao Paulo semi-pro football, before being brought to Braga in Portugal by agents.

There his transfer value was eventually part-owned by Quality Sports Investment, the company which has Jorge Mendes, Mourinho's agent, as a key player and investor. 

They moved him to Atletico Madrid, where he sat behind Sergio Aguero, his City rival today, then Radamel Falcao in the Atletico pecking order. He was farmed out on loan to Celta Vigo, Albacete and Real Valladolid before eventually getting his chance. 

The transformation from being Aguero's back-up to becoming his direct rival today is fascinating. Costa said: 'I loved watching him. He is, for me, the best I saw play, the best as a teammate. He's one of the absolutely top-level forwards around. 

I knew when he was there, Sergio was God. You knew what a great player he was. The truth was I learned a lot with him. I hope things keep going well. Now, we'll see who comes out on top in this game.' Another Brazilian, Filipe Luis, has followed Costa to Chelsea from Atletico Madrid and knew him through the leaner years. 

'I played with Diego five years ago and his growth has been huge,' said Filipe Luis. 

'Every year he gets better and more confident. If you go back in his career and look where he started and how he suffered, he has never needed time to adapt in any place.

'He always goes to a club and scores. For some players, like me, it is not easy when you get a new club, new team-mates and everything is new, especially the physicality. But for Diego it's never difficult.'

The Chelsea left-back also sees a clear comparison between their manager and his star signing. 'Diego always wants to win and if he doesn't he gets crazy, he gets mad. He's that sort of person. Jose is also likes this. 

'People with ambition, they always want to win and if you don't, it gets you mad. They try to get better and these sort of people really have to succeed in life.

So even when he spent the early part of his career as second best and sent on loan, Costa didn't despair, according to Filipe Luis.

'He wanted to go. He wanted to prove first to himself and then to other clubs that he was a good player and that he deserved his place at Atletico. 

He is a simple person with a big heart. Sometimes on the field he looks like he is crazy and he has one of the purest hearts I've ever known so I am proud to be his friend.'
