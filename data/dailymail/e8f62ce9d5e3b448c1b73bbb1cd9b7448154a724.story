A Christian family threatened with legal action for refusing to bake a cake in support of gay rights yesterday hit back, saying they should be able to run their business in line with their religious beliefs.

Ashers Baking Company – named after a verse in the Bible – turned down an order for a cake featuring Sesame Street puppets Bert and Ernie and the slogan ‘Support gay marriage’.

They were threatened with legal action after the gay rights activist who placed the order complained that equality laws had been breached. But yesterday general manager Daniel McArthur said he was determined to make a stand.

‘I would like the outcome of this to be that any Christians running a business could be allowed to follow their Christian beliefs and principles in the day-to-day running of the business and that they are allowed to make decisions based on that,’ he said.

‘I feel if we don’t take our stand with this case then how can we stand up against it further down the line, certainly from an equality point of view?’

Gareth Lee placed the order  several weeks ago at a branch  of Ashers in Belfast, one of six shops run by the Northern Ireland-based business. It is named after one of the 12 tribes of Israel. According to the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament, ‘Bread from Asher shall be rich and he shall yield royal dainties.’

Mr
 Lee wanted a ‘celebration cake’ decorated with an image of Sesame 
Street puppets Bert and Ernie, who have been adopted as unofficial 
mascots by same-sex marriage campaigners in the US based on an urban 
myth that they are gay couple.

It
 was to have featured the slogan ‘Support gay marriage’ – Northern 
Ireland is the only part of the UK where it has not been made legal – 
and the logo of Mr Lee’s campaign group, QueerSpace.

The
 request was passed to 24-year-old Mr McArthur’s parents, Colin and 
Karen, the firm’s founders, who declined to fulfil the order as it went 
against their religious beliefs, offering a refund instead.

‘It
 was in contradiction with what the Bible teaches and on the following 
Monday we rang up the customer to let him know that we could not take 
his order,’ he said.

Mr Lee is understood to have complained to the Equality Commission of Northern Ireland, which wrote to Ashers warning of legal action in the county court for breaching the law by discriminating against the customer on the grounds of his sexual orientation.

Mr McArthur said the commission had asked how it proposed to ‘recompense’ Mr Lee, but he pledged to resist its demand.

‘Although we have found this experience unsettling and disruptive to our business we are convinced that we have made the right decision,’ he said. ‘We continue to take the stand and stance that we take. Marriage in Northern Ireland has not been redefined. It still is defined as being a union between one man and one woman.’

Sesame Street viewers have long speculated lovable roomates Bert and Ernie are gay, although creators have never confirmed it.

In 2011, an online campaign was launched to make the rumoured relationship official.

'Let Bert & Ernie Get Married On Sesame Street', a petition at change.org as started by Illinois resident Lair Scott.

Responding to pressure at the time, a spokesman for Sesame Workshop wrote in a statement: '(Bert and Ernie) were created to teach preschoolers that people can be good friends with those who are very different from themselves.

'Even though the Sesame Street Muppets… possess many human traits and characteristics, they have no sexual orientation.'

Gay marriage is a highly divisive issue in Northern Ireland where the devolved assembly at Stormont has rejected several attempts to change the law on the issue.

The cake had been ordered for an event at the town hall in Bangor, County Down, hosted by the mayor, Alliance Party member Andrew Muir, to mark International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia on May 17. Another bakery ended up making the cake.

Yesterday Mr Muir said: ‘I fully support the action taken against this bakery. Businesses should not be able to pick and choose who they serve. There would not be any debate if the cake had depicted an anti-racism or anti-ageism slogan.’

But Colin Hart, of the Christian Institute, which is backing Ashers, said: ‘All the McArthurs want is to run their bakery according to their Christian beliefs.

‘Imbalanced equality laws are making it increasingly hard for people, especially Christians.’

The case is the latest in which Christians have faced the threat of court over their beliefs. Judges have ruled that it is wrong for businesses to refuse to serve gay people on grounds of religious conviction.

The Equality Commission said it would consider Ashers’ response ‘before taking further action’.
