Former IRA Commander Martin McGuinness is set to make an historic trip to Windsor Castle to attend a state banquet hosted by the Queen, it was claimed last night.

Two years after he memorably shook hands with the British monarch, Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister is said to be on the guest list for a white tie dinner in honor of Irish President Michael D Higgins next month.

It is believed he has also been invited to a Northern Ireland 'themed' reception, again at Windsor, being hosted by the Queen three days later.

Although both Buckingham Palace and the Irish Government refused to comment, the Belfast Telegraph said last night that he was 'likely' to attend.

The Mail understands that invitations to the State banquet have now been sent out, while invitations to the reception are set to be posted in the next few days. Any acceptance would, however, have to be ratified by senior officials within Sinn Fein.

The sight of a self-confessed IRA leader dining in the Queen's home would have been unthinkable only a few years ago.

But in 2012 - more than thirty years after her cousin, Lord Mountbatten of Burma was murdered by an IRA bomb as he holidayed with his family - the Queen agreed to meet with Mr McGuinness for the first time.

On a visit to Belfast to celebrate her Diamond Jubilee, the couple were introduced amid high security at a community reception held in a local theatre.

After much behind the scenes negotiation, the Queen shook the hand of the man once named the terrorist group's 'godfather of godfathers' not once but twice.

Although she has been at the heart of many events that have changed the course of history, few could have been so intensely personal.

The Queen adored her 'Uncle Dickie', who introduced her to her future husband, the Duke of Edinburgh. Philip, a nephew of Lord Mountbatten, was exceptionally close to the murdered aristocrat and took news of his death in 1979 equally hard.

The meeting was equally significant for Mr McGuinness who faced criticism from hard-line republicans who see the Queen as the face of oppression in their country.

He made clear, however, that he had been 
moved by the Queen's decision to acknowledge the 'sad and regrettable' 
history of Britain's troubled relationship with Ireland when she became 
the first British monarch to visit the republic for a century in 2011.

Still, the sight of Mr McGuinness dining in the historic surroundings of the Waterloo Chamber at Windsor will be something few who have experience of The Troubles ever thought they would witness.

Mr McGuinness has been open about his IRA past, but has always insisted he never killed anyone - claims that have been repeatedly questioned by his critics.

His attendance would be particularly remarkable given that Windsor Castle is the one royal residence the Queen truly calls home.

The town is also home to the Household Cavalry's Combermere Barracks. The regiment was the victim of the infamous Hyde Park bombing in 1982 which killed four soldiers and seven horses.

The President's historic five day 
visit, beginning on April 7, is first by an Irish head of state to the 
UK. Palace sources have made clear to the Mail that the monarch is 
taking a keener than normal interest in every detail.

The
 President and his wife will be met in London on April 8 by Prince 
Charles and Duchess of Cornwall and travel with them for a full 
ceremonial welcome in Windsor.

After
 greet the Queen and her husband they will join the royal couple for a 
state carriage procession to the castle, where they will reside all 
week.

The president will take inspect a Guard of Honour and enjoy a private lunch with the Queen before the evening's glittering state banquet. The dinner will be attended by senior royals including Prince Charles, who regarded Lord Mountbatten as his honorary grandfather and mentor.

Normally the monarch plays little part in the rest of a visit but on this occasion she will hold a second reception at castle on April 10 before formally bidding farewell to her guests the following day.

A spokesman for Buckingham Palace said last night: 'As with all state visits we would not announce the names of invitees in advance of the state banquet. Clearly if people who have been invited wish to make that fact public is a matter for them.'

Courtiers said the importance of the visit by the Irish President cannot be overstated.

'All state visits are important but this one is exceptional,' said one.

'It is particularly historic being the first inward state visit by an Irish president but also because it takes place so quickly after the Queen's own visit to Ireland in 2011 when she was made to feel so welcome.

'The Royal Household always takes great pride in the hospitality they offer but have very heavily invested in this visit in particular.

'The Queen regards Windsor Castle as her home and the fact that she has invited the Irish president to stay there is a mark of the importance she attributes to it.

'This is clearly something very personal for her and she is taking a very keen interest in every detail.' Speaking ahead of his meeting with the Queen in 2012, Mr McGuinness referred to a famous remark by former prime minister Tony Blair before the 1998 Good Friday peace deal, saying: 'There was a lot of talk in the past about someone feeling the hand of history on his shoulder.

'This is about stretching out the hand of peace and reconciliation to Queen Elizabeth who represents hundreds of thousands of unionists in the north.

'It is about me representing my party, wishing to show the unionist people in the north that we are prepared to respect what they believe in, albeit that we are still Irish republicans.

'I am an Irish republican now - after I meet with Queen Elizabeth, I will still be an Irish republican, and just as passionate about freedom, justice and peace, and reconciliation, as I was the day before.' Lord Mountbatten, a grand-son of Queen Victoria, was murdered when the IRA planted a bomb under his fishing boat off the coast of County Sligo.

Although pulled alive from the wreckage, he was fatally wounded by the explosion which also killed his son-in-law's mother, Lady Brabourne, his grandson, Nicholas, 14, a 15-year-old local boy, Paul Maxwell.

In the aftermath of the tragedy the Queen took the remaining family under her wing, caring for them at Balmoral, her Scottish home.

IRA bomb-maker Thomas McMahon was convicted for his part in the tragedy but released under the Good Friday Agreement.
