Disgraced celebrity chef Paula Deen today said she has learned 'so much' following her racism scandal last year - and vowed to come back stronger than ever.

A year after her famous meltdown on the Today show, Deen returned to chat with Matt Lauer  about her 'dark and difficult' year and made it clear  she has not been deterred.

When asked what she had learned after she admitted to using the 'n' word, Deen  said  people could find  out by watching her self-made documentary on her new Paula Deen Network - for $9.99.

'I really feel it's going to require another book,'  she said.

Comeback: Paula Deen appeared on the Today show on Tuesday - a year after her famous meltdown. She apologized for her hurtful words and discussed plans for her new network, which launches tomorrow

Support: She appeared on the  show with her sons Jamie and Bobby, who will also appear on the network

Last year, a former restaurant employee accused Deen of racial discrimination and sexual harassment, and in a deposition, Deen admitted to previously using racial slurs. It also emerged she had quipped about a 'Southern style wedding' featuring African-American servants.

As more details emerged, she was dropped by the Food Network and sponsors. She also appeared on the Today show, where she became hysterical as she begged for forgiveness.

'I didn't recognize that woman,' Deen said on Tuesday. 'That was a woman in trauma and shock, trying to understand what had happened. The cold hard fact was that I probably should not have been here but perhaps under the care of a doctor.'

After the show, she went home and thought about what had happened, she said.

'I had to go home, sit on my sofa and get off the merry-go-round so I could think and see things from all the angles,' she said. 

What a difference a year makes: Deen  broke down on the Today show amid the scandal last year

'I've learned so much over the year... The most powerful thing - the power of words. I don't care how old they are, words are so powerful, they can hurt.

'Frankly I disappointed myself. And for that I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry for the hurt I caused people. Because it went deep.... I'm here to make people happy, not to bring sadness.'

Now, she said, she is trying to forget the past and looking to the future.

After realizing that she still had an immense body of supporters, she decided to launch the Paula Deen Network and bought all of her content from the Food Network - but would not disclose the price.

She explained that fans can also find out more about her tumultuous year in a documentary, which is set to launch on the network - but it'll cost them.

The documentary will only be available to subscribers of her new website, which launches on Wednesday. Recipes on the site will be free, but viewers  need to pay $9.99 a month to view videos.

She added in an earlier interview: 'We hope to have it out the first of the year and tell everybody the true story of what really happened. It was a painful year for me. It was a hurtful year when I found myself being labeled for something I was not.'

The website will feature an ambitious array of original video content, including traditional cooking shows as well as lifestyle and game show segments featuring Deen and her sons.

The site, which will include no outside advertising or sponsors, also includes thousands of Deen's recipes, as well as menu planning tools.

Looking to the future: Deen and her two sons will launch the Paula Deen Network on Wednesday after buying all of her content from the Food Network. It will include videos, recipes and documentary about her past year

The plans are part of a larger effort by the star and her backers to resuscitate her career after the public relations disasters cost her nearly all her book, TV and endorsement deals.

In 2012, just before the race scandal exploded, Deen announced that she had developed Type-2 Diabetes - and she was widely criticized for promoting her brand of high-fat, sugary Southern cuisine and for scoring a lucrative endorsement deal for a drug to treat the condition she'd   hidden.

In 2013, a former manager at Deen's restaurants in Savannah, Georgia, sued her and her brother for sexual and racial harassment - and in a deposition, Deen acknowledged using the 'N word'.

Her former employee, who was white, was eventually forced to drop the racial part of her lawsuit - and Deen lamented that this had not been given as much airplay as the woman's initial claims.

'Of course the statement that was released at the end got almost no attention,' Deen said on the Today show.

She is now hoping that her new network will give her a degree of creative and financial control.

'That's the beauty of what we're doing now. We have total and complete control,' she told the Wall Street Journal. 'If we disagree on something, we can discuss it right then and there... It's as real as it can get.'
