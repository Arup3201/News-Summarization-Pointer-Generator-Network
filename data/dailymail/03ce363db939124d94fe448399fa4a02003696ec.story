He's known for his stern face and tough demeanor and it seems even a belly dancer can't raise a smile from tennis champion Andy Murray. 

Attending a players 'dinner at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships Murray looked unimpressed as the pretty woman pranced around him. 

Although he did turn to look at her at one point there was not even a flicker of a grin on his face. 

While the belly dancer tried her best to impress tennis champ Andy Murray he didn't look that happy to be attending the player's party following his first match at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships 

Andy looked bored as he attended the dinner last night in Dubai

He appeared to be there on his own, as Kim, who's usually loyally at his side, was nowhere in sight.

Andy is currently in Dubai to take part in the championships and yesterday he won his first round against Luxembourg's Giles Muller. 

Yesterday he said of his win: 'I made him work very hard on his service games. That was something I wanted to try to do from early on.

'The end of both sets I didn't serve so well but apart from that, I didn't give him any opportunities really.'

It is yet to be seen what Murray's finance Kim Sears will make of the scantily clad woman dancing around her man. 

The 27-year-old is known for her fiery temper after she was caught swearing on camera in January.

As Andy took on Czech player Tomas Berdych in the Australian Open semi final she was seen calling him a, 'Czech Flash F***.' 

However, she poked fun at herself the next day when she rocked up to Andy's next game in a jumper which read: 'Parental Advisory, Explicit Content.' 

But her fans were still not impressed with some of them accusing Kim, who is an artist who specialises in pet portraits, of racism. 

Andy later defending her actions saying in an interview that she had been 'whipped up,' by the media storm surrounding his match. 

The day after being caught on camera swearing during one of Andy's tennis matches Kim was spotted wearing this parental advisory jumper 

Andy and Kim are set to marry in a couple of months time at the hotel he owns in Scotland

He said: 'When there's a lot of tension surrounding something which you (the media) created, which you created, then it's completely normal.'

He added: 'Even Tomas, who very rarely says anything on the court, there was tension there for him, as well. Yeah, in the heat of the moment you can say stuff that you regret. And, yeah, that's it.'

Kim and Andy got engaged in November 2014 after nine years together. He presented her with a £200,000 which he is thought to have chosen himself. 

It was recently confirmed that the pair have set the date for their wedding as the 11th of April. 

They will wed in an intimate ceremony at  Cromlix House, a hotel in Scotland owned by Murray himself.
