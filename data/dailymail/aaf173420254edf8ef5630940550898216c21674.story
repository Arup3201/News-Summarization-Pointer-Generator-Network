Doctors have refused to operate on a Romanian man who has a fork stuck in his throat after swallowing it for a bet.

Radu Calincescu, 25, complained to 
doctors of pain and an uncomfortable feeling when he swallowed, but 
neglected to mention that he had also swallowed a fork earlier in the 
day.

It was only when the doctors in Bacau County carried out an X-ray that they found the metal fork lodged inside his esophagus.

It was only when questioned by doctors and he was confronted with the X-ray images that the embarrassed man admitted he had taken part in a bet with friends to prove how tough he was.

And incredibly, doctors who had little tolerance for the foolish prank told the man they did not have time to remove it, and ordered him to wait and see if it came out the natural way.

Calincescu said: 'I had been drinking and I bet with my friend that I could swallow the fork without getting hurt.

'I put the fork in my mouth and managed to swallow it.

'At first it didn't hurt, but after some minutes I experienced intense pain that just got worse, and I was forced to go to hospital.'

Luckily for Calincescu, the fork was not disturbing his airway or threatening any vital organs and at the moment does not need an emergency operation.

He said: 'I was discharged and told I should wait and see if the fork will take its natural course and make its way through my body and leave the natural way.

'But I have to come back in a few days to see if the fork has moved. If it reaches my stomach and looks like it could pierce the lining I will need an operation.

'I realise now it was a very stupid thing to do. I don't think I will be taking part in any bets for a while.'
