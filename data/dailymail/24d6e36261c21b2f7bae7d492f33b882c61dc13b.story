They began working at the Lindt Cafe at the same time and were close friends but Paolo Vassallo knew he had to leave Tori Johnson behind, if he ever hoped to see his family again.

On the 60 Minutes Sydney Siege Special, to go to air on Sunday night at 7pm, the 36-year-old father of two tells Liz Hayes, the prospect of never seeing his wife and two children spurred him into action.

He left home early that Monday morning when everyone was still asleep.

'I didn't say bye to anyone,' Mr Vassallo recounted.

Paolo Vassallo started working for Lindt Chocolate Cafe in Sydney's Martin Place the same week as manager Tori Johnson. He made the decision to run for his life after the first two hostages escaped

Mr Vassallo started at the Lindt Chocolate Cafe in October 2012, the same week as manager Tori Johnson.

But when John O'Brien and Stefan Balafoutis made their move, he made a decision to be next should the opportunity present itself and did it 'knowing that you could possibly never see them (his family) again'.

He has two children, one aged three and another just six months old.

The fear set in almost immediately, he tells Liz Hayes, when gunman Man Monis ordered Mr Johnson to lock the front door.

'This gun just came out from nowhere, "I will shoot someone" he said, I will do it,' said the kitchen supervisor.

'We were all scared, everyone was scared.'

While his co-worker was one of the first to escape, Joel Herat, 21, was one of the last.

He followed his mate Jarrod Morton-Hoffman, 19, and three others, in making a run for it at about 2.03am on Tuesday.

'Running, just running for our lives,' he revealed.

But with their attempted escape came the risk of being gunned down. 

'As we were running he came running out and started shooting at us,' Mr Herat said.

'The spray of the bullets just went everywhere.'

'Running, just running for our lives' said Joel Herat (front). He tells 60 Minutes how the gunman started shooting at them as they made the break for freedom

'They're your family, I just wanted everyone to get out' Joel Herat breaks down during the 60 Minutes interview as he remembers the final minutes of the Sydney siege

Once out of harm's way, his thoughts turned to those who were still trapped inside, include more co-workers.

'They're your family, you see them every day. I just wanted everyone to get out.'

60 Minutes will air the Sydney Siege Special on Sunday at 7pm after its nightly news.

However, in another twist in the battle for ratings supremacy, the Seven Network has flagged an unprecedented step, dispensing with its 6pm news bulletin in favour of an early start to its 'Inside The Siege: The Untold Story'.

Tori Johnson (left) and Katrina Dawson (right) were victims of the Lindt cafe siege. Gunman Man Monis took 18 people hostage and most of the survivors have told their stories to the Nine and Seven networks in specials due to air on Sunday night

It will focus heavily on the harrowing accounts by Westpac executive Marcia Mikhael of Katrina Dawson's last living moments.

She tells of looking into Ms Dawson’s eyes during the mother-of-three's fearful last moments, as the fire-fight unfolded between the crazed gunman and heavily armed police.

Ms Dawson, 38, was killed when the siege reached its bloody end, struck by six fragments of police bullets. 

‘Katrina and I look at each other, and you could see the fear on her face and I must have had the same fear on my face as well, because I was terrified,’ Ms Mikhael told Channel Seven.

‘And I took one last look at Katrina and she looked at me.

'Then she puts her hands on her face and she puts her face down like to protect her face.

'I kind of go into a foetal position, you know, and my legs get hit,’ Ms Mikhael said.

Ms Mikhael was next to Ms Dawson, she said, facing her as they lay next to each other. 

When Ms Mikhael next saw Ms Dawson’s face, she wasn't moving.

Ms Mikhael was shot and describes the pain as ‘agony’ but suppressed her screams, desperate to remain inconspicuous.

She hoped her silence could save her from an attack by Monis, who fired his gun at police at least twice before he was killed.

‘It was just so loud, so many shots, so many,’ Ms Mikhael said of the shoot out during her interview with Channel Seven.

Eighteen people were held captive by Man Monis, during the 17-hour-long siege at Martin Place on December 15.

60 Minutes will also document the revelations of Louisa Hope, who tells of the moment Monis made Mr Johnson  kneel down in front of him, before he shot him in the back of the head.

Ms Hope, 50, was used as a human shield by the gunman during the 17-hour-long ordeal at Martin Place on December 15. Unable to defend herself due to her multiple sclerosis, she had to bide her time, meaning she was by his side until the very end.

Ms Hope and her mother Robyn, 68, had made a visit to the cafe on the morning of the siege during their annual Christmas outing. It was the first time they had ever gone inside.

Almost two months after the siege, Louisa remains in hospital recovering from her injuries.

They were on either side of siege victim Tori Johnson in his final moments. In what they thought was their final moments, the mother and daughter swore to each other that they would not leave each other. 

Ms Hope's comments come after an inquest into the siege  revealed the barrel of the shotgun was held just 75 centimetres from Mr Johnson's head when he was executed, prompting police to storm the Lindt cafe. 

Seven will also show previously unseen footage from inside the cafe, taken from their locked down newsroom across the way.

it will include information about how the second escape took place, when Elly Chen and Jieun Bae managed to run free. Their escape was so silent that Monis did not even realise the young women had fled.

Ms Chen, who had only worked at the café for three shifts, became so overcome with the trauma of the ordeal that she suffered a panic attack at the café.

She collapsed on the ground and Monis pressed the gun to her back.

Jieun Bae and Elly Chen managed to run free during the afternoon. Their escape was so silent that Monis apparently did not even realise the young women

Channel Seven reports that the hostages around her screamed and shouted in anger as Ms Chen’s fear escalated.

After Ms Chen recovered, the two café workers noticed that a door in the café was locked by a latch and would allow them to flee to Martin Place.

They took several minutes to silently pull the latch open and slip out into the street.

The images of the young women running down the street, their faces etched with terror and anguish, beamed around the world who watched on in horror.
