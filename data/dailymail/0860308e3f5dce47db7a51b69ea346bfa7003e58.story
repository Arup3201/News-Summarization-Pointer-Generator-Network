A 90-year-old veteran who was shot by a sniper during the Second World War had the bullet lodged in his hip for 69 years.

Jack Mansell was just 21 when he was shot during Operation Market Garden in Arnhem, The Netherlands.

The former vet from West Bromwich, West Midlands, thought the bullet had passed right through him in the attack - which saw 17,000 Allied troops perish.

Private Mansell went to doctors for an x-ray 30 years later following an abdomen injury and discovered the artillery was still in his hip.

The bullet remained inside Pte Mansell, who fought in the Second Battalion of the South Staffordshire Regiment, until his death on November 14, 69 years after the infamous attack.

Pte Mansell, who lost his beloved wife Evelyn ten years ago after a long illness, was cremated at West Bromwich crematorium on November 22 and the bullet was found among his ashes by staff.

Five regimental standard bearers attended the service,  where a bugler played The Last Post in his honour.

More than 300 friends and family, who raised 
£620 for Help for Heroes, also attended to pay their respects.

Remains: The bullet, pictured in its slightly melted state, was found among the veteran's ashes by staff at West Bromwich crematorium

Speaking after the service the veteran's nephew
 Kevin Edwards, 53, said: 'During the 1980s Jack injured his abdomen 
while moving some metal at work.

'A
 routine hospital x-ray showed showed a bullet located in his right hip.

'All those years ago Jack had though the German bullet had passed 
through him - in fact it was still lodged in his body. It was left there as it gave him no trouble.

'Later
 in his life he used to tell people about the bullet in his right hip. 
He had loads of x-rays afterwards and they always asked if he wanted it 
out but he said it didn’t bother him.

In honour: The hero, pictured with his nephew Kevin Edwards, at his brother's grave in 2004

'He lost his brother during the war, and he was a very proud man, never considered himself to be a hero even though he was.

'He was put up against the wall and a firing squad twice, after that he always said he could face anything.

'When he was cremated we asked them to keep an eye out for the bullet, but never thought it would make it out.

'Then when we collected his ashes the people from the crematorium also handed us an envelope.

Happy life: Pte Mansell, pictured at home with his dog Buffy, died on November 14. His beloved wife Evelyn, right, died 10 years ago following a long illness

'Inside was the bullet, it is a bit melted, but still we know what it is.

'He was a very popular well loved man. Men like him are literally a dying breed, and should never be forgotten.

Operation
 Market Garden took place between 17 and 25 September 1944 in the 
Netherlands and Germany. It was hoped the mission, the largest airborne 
operation at the time, might bring the end to the war by Christmas 1944.

The
 goal was to force an entry into Germany over the Lower Rhine. At first 
the operation was successful, but at Arnhem, the British 1st Airborne 
Division encountered far stronger resistance than anticipated.

In
 the ensuing battle, only a small force managed to hold one end of the 
Arnhem road bridge and they were eventually overrun on 21 September.

Pte Mansell was part of an anti tank unit when his team were landed by gliders.

After fighting tanks for several days, he was shot by a sniper in the hip.

The bullet is thought to have remained in its original state in his hip until his death.

It only changed shape when the hero's body was cremated at the end of November.

'He was a wonderful man, he got me my job at the same factory he worked in.

'His war stories were amazing, I could sit and listen to him for hours.'

Julie Wilds, Pte Mansell's daughter, added: 'My
 dad was a very easy going, family orientated man. He was a massive 
baggies fan and still went to a lot of matches in his old age.

'Despite
 the amazing things he had done he didn’t really talk about it till his 
later life, but when he did, the stories I’ve been told were amazing.'

Pte Mansell was part of an anti tank unit when his team were landed by gliders in the attack.

After fighting waves of tanks for several days it was only when he was forced to pull back that Pte Mansell was shot by a sniper through his right hip.

The veteran was taken in by a Dutch family after his injury - but was hunted down by the Nazis and hauled away to a Prisoner Of War camp.

There he was twice put in front of a firing squad after helping to sabotage German train lines - but lived to tell the tale.

His nephew Kevin Edwards said: 'He was captured and became a prisoner of war, he was set to be shot by a firing squad along with a few others but he managed to escape.

'I'm not sure how he did it but he managed it and that is when he was taken in by the Dutch family.

'It's incredibly because he managed to escape again hours before he was due before the firing squad.

'His brother wasn't killed in the same war where Uncle Jack was shot, he was killed a month before the war ended in Germany.

'He was only 18 at the time but he stepped on a landmine in Klebe in Germany and died instantly.'

After spending a year in Germany working as an Army dispatch rider after the war he returned to his native West Midlands and worked as a sheet metal engineer.

He lived at home until just a few months ago when ill health forced him into a nursing home, where he died.
