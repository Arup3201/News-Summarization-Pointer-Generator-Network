Pervert James Manchand, 48, used a small voice-activated camera to make covert videos of women

A father-of-two targeted women in city centre shops and used a small voice-activated camera to make secret upskirt videos of them.

James Manchand, 48, who just hours before had been at a sex offenders course for an almost identical crime, was caught after suspicious security guards at Manchester's Market Street Boots  realised he was following women around their store.

The guards, who had at first thought he was a shoplifter, kept watching him as he left the store and went to the nearby Marks & Spencer.

When police were called, Manchand, of Blackrod, Bolton, became agitated and was arrested, Manchester Magistrates' Court heard.

Officers searched unemployed Manchand and found a small camera which had been strapped to his shoe under his laces.

Prosecutor Kerry Benn told the magistrates: 'He had been videoing women without their knowledge under their skirts.'

Ms Benn said detectives viewed the footage and realised that his victims appeared not to know what was going on.

Manchand was caught 
out just before 5pm on June 22.

Only hours earlier he had started the
sex offenders course run by probation officers as part
of his sentence for the near identical crime committed in 2010.

When he was interviewed by police, Manchand admitted his crime but insisted it was a ‘blip in my rehabilitation’.

Pleading not to be jailed, Manchand told magistrates: 'I just wanted to say how deeply remorseful I am for my actions.

'I am truly sorry to the victims, my partner and everybody else I have let down.

'It goes without saying this type of behaviour will not happen again in the future.'

Handing Manchand a 26-week suspended prison sentence, chairman of the bench Ron Beattie told the defendant: 'This is a second similar offence.

'This was clearly pre-planned in that you purchased a specialist camera.

'We believe this matter crosses the custody threshold.

'However, we believe the public would be better served by you completing the present course you are on, therefore we are going to suspend this sentence for two years.'

Manchand, who admitted one count of outraging public decency, was also ordered to carry out 200 hours' unpaid work as part of a two-year community order.

The magistrates also gave him an indefinite sex offending prevention order and placed him on the sex offenders’ register for the next five years.

James Street, defending, suggested his client experienced an ‘adrenaline rush’ while committing his crimes because of the fear of getting caught rather than for sexual gratification.

Mr Street said his client had since ‘done well’ on the probation course for sex offenders, adding: 'He has fully co-operated with the programme and he tells me he’s one of the most active members.'
