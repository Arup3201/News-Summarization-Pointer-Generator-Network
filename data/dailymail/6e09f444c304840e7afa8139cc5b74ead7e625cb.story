A mother of two from Massachusetts has received an apology from JetBlue after a flight attendant did nothing to help when her three-year-old had a bathroom emergency on the plane and was forced to urinate in her seat.

Jennifer Devereaux, a photographer from West Newton, was returning home from New York on Monday when she says the 30-minute trip aboard JetBlue Flight 518 turned into a nightmare for her and her two daughters. 

The plane was sitting on the tarmac at John F Kennedy International Airport for about 30 minutes when Devereaux's daughter Summer said she needed to use the restroom.

Mother of two Jennifer Devereaux, from West Newton, Massachusetts, has received an apology from JetBlue after a flight attendant did nothing to help when her three-year-old daughter Summer had a bathroom emergency on a plane

The mother asked a flight attendant if her toddler could use the bathroom, but in response the woman allegedly 'snapped' at Devereaux, ordering her to 'sit down.'

But little Summer could not wait any longer and ended up relieving herself in her seat.

‘It wasn’t about bad customer service at that point, it was about bad human decency. My daughter was sitting in a pool of urine and I couldn’t do anything about it,’ Deveraux told CBS Boston. ‘And as a mom it just broke my heart.’

The married mother of two had no napkins or towels on hand, so she was forced to use her own sweater to soak up the mess.

As she was trying to tidy up, Mrs Devereaux said the flight attendant yelled at her.

‘And I said, “Please give me a break. My daughter had an accident because you wouldn’t let me take her to the bathroom. After I clean it up I will sit down.” She turned around and reported it to the pilot,’ said Devereaux.

As the plane was turned around and returned to the gate, the captain’s voice came on the PA system announcing that there is a non-compliant passenger who would be removed by security guards.

Jennifer Devereaux, who was traveling alone with her two daughters, grew fearful, but fortunately for her an off-duty pilot who was sitting in front of her was able to convince his colleagues in the cockpit to let her stay.

Upon returning home to West Newton, the mother of two penned a complaint to the airline demanding an apology for the flight crew's behavior towards her family.

She says JetBlue apologized to her Saturday, offered her a full credit and $5,000 to the charity of her choice.  Devereaux said this is the best response they could have received.

'She said "I am a mom too. I understand what you’re going through and I am so sorry this happened to you,’” Devereaux explained. 'It just felt so good to hear those words from someone from that company.'

JetBlue says employees will undergo sensitivity training.
