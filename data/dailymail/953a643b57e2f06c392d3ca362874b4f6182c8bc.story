People wearing Google Glass eyewear could be banned from strip clubs, cinemas and casinos because their owners don’t want them filming there.

Bosses for establishments in the US said that due to privacy concerns they would be asking anyone wearing the glasses to remove them or they won’t be let in.

Lap dance clubs said that they would treat Google Glass wearers the same as anyone caught filming a stripper - and would kick them out.

Casinos said they could help cheaters to win unfairly and cinemas said that they could be used to illegally record films and sell pirate copies.

Parks departments and banks across America are also waiting to see how the new technology is used before deciding whether or not to ban them, NBC reported.

Google Glass has caused concern because it has a camera next to the wearer’s eye which can take photos or record video without a red light or a shutter sound to tell others that it is working.

The glasses, which cost $1,500 a pair (£980), are currently on limited release but will be more widely available later this year.

Peter Feinstein, managing partner of Sapphire Gentlemen's Club in Las Vegas, said that patrons will be asked to check the eyewear when they come in.

He said: ‘We've been dealing with the cellphone videoing and the picture taking over the years and we are quick to make sure that that doesn't happen in the club.

‘As the sale of (Google Glass) spreads, there'll be more people using them and wanting to use them at places such as a gentlemen's club.

‘If we see those in the club, we would do the same thing that we do to people who bring cameras into the club.

The glasses will also be able to take part in live video chats

‘If they don't want to check it, we'd be happy to give them a limo ride back to their hotel’.

A spokesman for MGM resorts, which owns the MGM Grand Casino in Las Vegas, said that picture-taking was ‘frowned upon’ inside its properties.

He said: ‘Security officers on duty ask individuals not to take pictures for the privacy of others in the casino.

‘This new product is nothing new in terms of a challenge for us, because for so many years, the very tiniest of portable lipstick and pinpoint cameras have been around.’

The MGM Grand Hotel and Casino is one of the first to ban Google Glass

Regal Entertainment Group, one of the largest cinema chains in the US, added that no recording devices were permitted into its cinemas.

People wearing Google Glass style specs have already been subjected to ‘cyber discrimination’ in France.

University of Toronto computer engineering professor Steve Mann was at a McDonald’s restaurant in Paris when he claims an employee tried to physically remove a similar gadget he designed from his head.

He wrote about it in a blog post which sparked calls from tech website TechCrunch to boycott the fast food chain.
