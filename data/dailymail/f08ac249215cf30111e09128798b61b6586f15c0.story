Albert Bevins died last year after being diagnosed with dementia and suffering hallucinations

The family of a great-grandfather with dementia fear he may have hanged himself while acting out a 'vivid dream' that was triggered by a TV documentary about Harold Shipman.

Albert Bevins died in Eachstep nursing home in Blackley, Manchester, the day after  a programme was shown about Harold Shipman, a GP who killed 215 elderly patients with lethal injections.

The 85-year-old was prone to vivid hallucinations, the result of untreated dementia, at the time of his death, an inquest heard.  

Family members fear he may have died during one such dream, with the widower having previously been found sleepwalking and acting out his hallucinations.

At an inquest into his death, his daughter, Joanne Jones, said he had become plagued with paranoia since being diagnosed with dementia.  

'The only conclusion I can come to regarding his death is he had very vivid dreams,' she said.

'He always thought the family was in danger, especially his grandsons and great-grandsons. 

'He thought something had happened to them in the night like a car crash and he wouldn't be consoled until he spoke to us. 

'He used to live out his dreams but we just don’t know what dream he had that night.' 

She added she feared a documentary on television the previous night about Shipman, who killed hundreds of elderly patients, may have sparked caused her father to hallucinate.  

'I thought "could he have been watching that and that has triggered something?" He would see things on the TV and related it to himself.' 

The 85-year-old was being cared for at Eachstep home in Blackley, Manchester, at the time of his death 

Mr Bevins was diagnosed with vascular dementia in 2012 and moved into Eachstep care home the following year. 

Despite revisiting doctors in 2014, nothing was prescribed to treat his worsening condition which had started to cause him to hallucinate.

Experts told the inquest that 'important elements' of assessment were missed out during the latter visit to doctors.  

The former office clerk died in April last year at around 7am, with staff at the specialist house having checked on him in his room just two hours earlier. 

An investigation into Mr Bevins's diagnosis was launched by the NHS trust after his death.

At its conclusion, psychiatrist Dr Sean Lennon from the Manchester Mental Health and Social Care Trust said Mr Bevins's condition,  dementia with Lewy Bodies, was not treated soon enough.

'The referral wasn't responded to urgently...there were a number of delays in providing him with the care he required,' he told the Manchester inquest. 

'He should have been offered treatment which may have improved the psychotic symptoms but it may well have been he could be managed by further assessment.'

Recording a narrative conclusion that Mr Bevins took his own life coroner Jean Harkin said: 'His time in the care home was, by all accounts, good.

'He was very well looked after and the family here have reported staff made him feel wanted. 

'It is clear from the staff that he was a very well-liked gentleman and this has been a very traumatic experience not only for the family but also for the staff who looked after him.'

Harold Shipman, a GP who murdered patients by administering killer injections, is described as one of the most prolific serial killers in Britain's history. 

For years the doctor went unnoticed as he prescribed patients with death sentences, killing them off for no other reason than for his own entertainment. 

Born in Leeds, the former doctor was his considered his mother's favourite child. 

After she was diagnosed with lung cancer, he oversaw her decline and carefully observed the effects of morphine as a means of pain relief. 

Following her death he vowed to attend medical school and later qualified to become a doctor, registering with a practice in Yorkshire in the early 1970s. 

He later moved to Hyde with his family where his sadistic tendencies were revealed. 

It was a local undertaker who first raised concerns after an unusually high number of Shipman's patients died in similar circumstances.

Largely they were recorded as having been found propped up on a sofa, fully clothed, at the time of their deaths. 

An inquiry was launched after one of Shipman's colleagues expressed similar concerns but he was cleared. 

But after a more thorough investigation police discovered he had altered medical records to evade suspicion. 

In 1998, Shipman was arrested for the murder of several patients. He consistently denied the allegations and was, according to investigators, arrogant throughout police interviews. 

A trial found him guilty of the murders of 15 patients though experts believe he is responsible for hundreds of other deaths. 

Pathology reports found morphine toxicity was the cause of death among most of his victims. 

In 2004, four years after being jailed for his crimes, Shipman's body was found hanging in the cell of the Wakefield Prison where he was being held.
