The number of police officers in England and Wales has fallen to its lowest level in nine years, figures showed today.

Office numbers plummeted  to 134,101 - more than 5,000 fewer than the previous year and fewer than at any point since 2003, the Home Office data showed.

The number of police staff was also down, dropping 8.8 per cent to 67,474 and police community support officers (PCSOs) fell 9 per cent to 14,393.

PCSOs are not police officers; they are 
civilian members of police staff. They are designed purely to tackle 
local anti-social behaviour and local issues.

But the number of special constables rose 10.4per cent to 20,343, the figures showed.

Special Constabules are the UK's 
part-time police force. They are made up of volunteer members of the 
public who when on duty wear a uniform and have full police powers.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: 'The Tory-led Government has cut nearly 10,000 police officers from communities across the country.

'And we know that substantially more than half are from 999, neighbourhood and traffic response - the officers we rely on in an emergency.

Yvette Cooper says the Conservative government is more interested in cutting police numbers than crime

'These figures show the cuts to the police are deeper and faster even than experts predicted.

'David Cameron's promise to protect the front line has been ripped apart by these appalling figures.

'In just two years the Government has taken police numbers back by nearly a decade, weakened police powers, undermined morale and reduced crime prevention.

'Theresa May has no strategy to cut crime, only to cut police.'

In the 12 months to 31 March 2012, the 43 police forces have recruited just 2,394 full-time equivalent officers.

Only the Surrey police force has seen an increase in its number of officers over the 12 months to March, rising 4.7per cent from 1,885 to 1,974.

This is because they are recruiting now as they underwent reductions in officer numbers between 2006 and 2009, several years before England and Wales as a whole.

The biggest drop  in terms of percentage came in Derbyshire, where police officer numbers fell 10per cent from 2,021 at the end of March last year to 1,819 12 months later.

Warwickshire, where officer numbers fell 8.2per cent from 919 to 844, and Cleveland, where officer numbers fell 7.6per cent from 1,655 to 1,529, also saw significant reductions.

The largest numerical decrease was felt by the West Midlands, whose lost 323 officers (4 per cent).

Policing and Criminal Justice Minister Nick Herbert said: 'These reductions in officer numbers are in line with HMIC (Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary) predictions as a result of necessary savings by forces who are playing their part in reducing the deficit.

'However, HMIC projections also showed that 94per cent of officers in the front line will remain, the proportion on the front line is increasing and service to the public is largely being maintained.

Fading fast: Police graduates passing out at the Hendon police academy, London, as it was revealed the number of police officers has fallen to its lowest level in nine years

'We inherited a situation where there
were some 25,000 officers not on the front line, so there was plenty of
scope for forces to make savings while improving performance, as forces
are showing as they continue to drive down crime.'

The Metropolitan Police Service is the largest force, accounting for 24.0 per cent of all officers on 31 March 2012.

The
eight Metropolitan forces - Greater Manchester, City of London, 
Merseyside, Metropolitan Police, Northumbria, South Yorkshire, West 
Midlands and West Yorkshire - accounted for 47.9 per cent of all 
officers.

The largest decreases in percentage terms were in Derbyshire, down 10 per cent (202 officers) and Warwickshire, whose numbers fell 8.2 per cent  (75 officers).

The largest numerical decrease was in the West Midlands, who dropped 4 per cent (323 officers).

There were decreases in total officer strength in all nine English Regions and in Wales in the 12 months to March 2012. 

The largest decrease in percentage terms was in the East Midlands region, who fell 6.1 per cent (554 officers).
