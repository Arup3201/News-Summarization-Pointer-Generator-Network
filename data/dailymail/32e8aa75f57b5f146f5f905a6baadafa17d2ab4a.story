Should Ross Barkley start for England at the World Cup?

During one of Everton’s first training sessions under Roberto Martinez, the new manager set up a small-sided drill to assess the technical ability of his players.

Martinez paid special attention to Ross Barkley as the young midfielder snatched at a couple of chances and sent them high and wide of the small target.

‘It would have been easy for the players to be critical of him, but what impressed me was that he had their complete respect,’ Martinez recalled on Thursday.

The Everton midfielder composed himself and hit the target with shots into the top left and top right with his next two shots.

‘Again, no-one said a word,’ said Martinez. ‘They just knew that’s what he can do.’

Barkley’s decision-making has become a discussion point after Roy Hodgson’s fumbled attempt to deflect some of the attention from the youngster.

England’s head coach knows it doesn’t work like that, especially with a World Cup in Brazil just days away. Hodgson, for all his world- wise experience of football at every level, knows better than that. Or at least he should do.

Maestro: Barkley was one of England's best players during the 2-2 against Ecuador

Martinez, who was in his office at Everton’s Finch Farm training centre, watched Barkley’s outstanding performance against Ecuador in his first start.

‘He is the biggest talent for his age I have seen in European football,’ he added.

That is quite a statement.

‘He is a special player, a unique player and that is so rare. He has power, pace and technical ability - elements you rarely find in a player. He would look at home in the Spanish, German or Dutch models, no doubt about it. We have a responsibility to develop his talent and to protect and nurture him.’

Ill-judged: Roy Hodgson attempted to protect Barkley by criticising his passing after the game

Hodgson wanted to protect him too, but chose his words badly when he criticised Barkley for  giving the ball away too often.

It was clumsy, particularly after the young midfielder had set up Rickie Lambert’s goal that started with a nutmeg on Jorge Guagua before a breathtaking run that led to England’s second.

‘He’s got drive, he’s got energy, but he’s got to learn when to release the ball,’ was Hodgson’s damning assessment of his performance. It felt like a strange thing to say.

‘For every good turn there was a time when he lost the ball and put us on the back foot defensively,’ he added.

But Barkley is a breathtaking  talent and Martinez believes he  will mature into a ‘No 6’ central  midfielder in time. He plays a risky game, eager to please and show-off his ball skills for club and country.

In the right area, it should be encouraged.

‘The back heel to Rooney, the pass for Lambert’s goal and the shot Ross had, give you an  indication of the player that he will become,’ added Martinez, who will travel to the World Cup next week.

‘We have to allow him room to develop and let’s not put too much pressure on him. At the moment  he is perfectly suited to playing in the No 10 role, but in time he will develop into the complete  midfielder. Nothing fazes him, but the World Cup is a massive event and Ross needs protection.

‘We just need to calm things down a bit and don’t expect too much from him. I’ve seen what Roy had to say after the game but I think he was just trying to protect him a  little bit.’

Barkley’s team-mates have been impressed with his ability and he has added another dimension to this England team ahead of the opening group game against Italy.

Frank Lampard, who captained the team against Ecuador in the Sun Life Stadium, is convinced he has the characteristics to be a top player.

Shocked: Martinez was shocked by the 'complete respect' that Barkley had from Everton players

‘It’s the fearlessness of youth,’ said Lampard. ‘He has great ability on the ball, running at people and taking them out — and that’s what you want to see.

‘It’s brilliant for him, brilliant for the team and individually to see him come through. It’s great for the team to have players in those attacking areas who can make things happen.

‘I’m sure he will have learnt a lot from the game in terms of positions to pick up, times to turn, times not to. But when you’ve got players like that in a team, players who can run away from people and make things happen, then you’re very happy.

Going places: Frank Lampard claims Barkley has the characteristics to become to top player for England

‘He’s a young boy and good luck to him, it’s good to see him come in and do so well.’

Like Martinez, Lampard sees Barkley in a more advanced role  in the early phase of his development. There is a swagger about the Liverpudlian, with flashes of Paul Gascoigne in his swashbuckling nature. At 20, he is still learning the game.

‘He’s got the bit between his teeth and he’s more of a No 10 than I ever was,’ added Lampard.

‘He’s very good at receiving the ball and turning quickly. He’s only going to get better.

‘That’s his first start so, considering that, when you look at him and what he’s done, he’s made the  second goal and shown enough there that we can say that he deserves his place in the squad. He’s a great addition.’
