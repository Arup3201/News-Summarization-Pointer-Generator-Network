Theresa May has said she wants to be able to 
'deport Abu Qatada so he's not in this country when the Olympics come'.

She told the House of Commons the Government would do 'everything 
we can within the existing legal regime to deport Qatada and we're doing
everything we can to reform that regime to avoid these cases in 
future.'

As things stand, the notorious hate preacher will 
be free to walk the streets and take his child to school within a week, 
after a court ruled he must be bailed.

Swipe: Theresa May telling the Commons 'the right place for a foreign terrorist is a foreign prison cell' after a judge ruled radical Muslim cleric Abu Qatada should be bailed

Ministers are attempting to deport 
him to Jordan to stand trial on terror charges, but three weeks ago they
were blocked by European human rights judges.

Mrs May blasted the judge's decision 
to free Osama Bin Laden's 'ambassador in Europe' and said 'the right 
place for the foreign terrorist is a foreign prison cell'.

She said it was simply not acceptable that Britain cannot 
deport a radical Muslim cleric who 'poses a serious risk to our national
security'.

She also pointed out that as Qatada does not have immigration status he is not entitled to claim benefits.

'The right place for a terrorist is a
prison cell; the right place for a foreign terrorist is a foreign 
prison cell far away from Britain,' she said.

Mrs May said British courts had found
Qatada 'poses a serious risk to our national security', has a 
'long-standing association with Al Qaeda' and provides 'religious 
justification for acts of violence and terror'.

The radical Muslim cleric is expected to walk free from Long Lartin high security prison in Worcestershire on Monday.

Preacher of hate Abu Qatada (left) can be released on bail after more than six years in prison, Mr Justice Mitting (right) ruled

The Home Secretary said that the preacher will be arrested if he breaks any of his stringent bail conditions.

He has been given a 22-hour curfew, 
must wear an electronic tag and has been told there are strict 
conditions over who he can meet.

But yesterday Mr Justice Mitting ruled that he must be allowed to walk his youngest child to school under his bail conditions.

'If any of these conditions are breached, he will be re-arrested and we will seek his immediate re-detention,' she added.

Tory backbenchers jeered, and one 
shouted 'disgrace', as Mrs May explained the Government's opposition to 
last month's ruling and the subsequent decision to grant Qatada bail.

She said: 'But however strict the bail conditions, I continue to believe that Qatada should remain behind bars.

'It simply isn't acceptable that, 
after guarantees from the Jordanians about his treatment, after British 
courts have found he is dangerous, after his removal has been approved 
by the highest courts in our land, we still cannot deport dangerous 
foreign nationals.'

Qatada is currently being held at the Category A Long Lartin prison, but after a judge's ruling will walk free within days

Qatada has been held for 
six-and-a-half years, more than any other detainee in modern immigration
history, while fighting deportation to Jordan.

But he will be released from the 
maximum security prison where he is being held after applying for bail 
when human rights judges in Europe ruled he could not be deported 
without assurances from Jordan that evidence gained through torture 
would not be used against him.

He has cost taxpayers more than £1million in benefits, prison costs and legal fees.

Mrs May said the Government was 
continuing to consider the case for a British Bill of Rights and the 
Prime Minister was leading the case for reform of the Strasbourg-based 
human rights court.

Officials do not consider it likely 
that Qatada will take part in the planning of a terrorist attack or 
other operational activities.

However, it is feared he could use the internet to give justification for attacks overseas or in Britain.

The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has overruled every court in Britain in ruling that Abu Qatada can stay in Britain

Officials want to prevent this 
happening by banning him from having a mobile phone or access to the 
internet, where his sermons could be uploaded on to extremist websites.

In his ruling, Mr Justice Mitting 
said Qatada’s bail conditions could be relaxed within three months 
unless Britain makes ‘demonstrable progress’ in negotiations to send the
52-year-old home.

Last month, judges in Strasbourg 
ruled that Qatada could not be deported in case evidence obtained from 
torture was used against him at trial in Jordan. British diplomats are 
trying to extract assurances that this will not happen.

Attorney General Dominic Grieve said the Government was bound by the rule of law 'as much as anybody else'.

He told the BBC Radio 4 Today 
programme: 'The Government is obviously very concerned about this case 
and very much wishes to see Abu Qatada deported to Jordan and, when he 
is in Jordan, tried fairly if the Jordanian authorities wish to put him 
on trial.

'He cannot be deported unless the 
assurances which are required following the judgement in the European 
Court of Human Rights can be secured.'

Abu Qatada has variously been described as 'Al Qaeda's spiritual leader in Europe', 'Osama bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe', 'the most significant extremist preacher in the UK' and 'a truly dangerous individual'.

The Jordanian father of five, whose real name is Omar Mahmoud Mohammed Othman, claimed asylum when he arrived in Britain in September 1993 on a forged passport.

He was allowed to stay and preach his extremism, and was accused of calling on British Muslims to martyr themselves in a holy war on 'oppression'.

A 1995 'fatwa' he issued justified the killing of converts from Islam, their wives and children in Algeria. In October 1999 a sermon in London called for the killing of Jews and praised attacks on Americans. And the same year he was convicted in his absence of planning terror attacks in Jordan.

When he was arrested in February 2001 he was found in possession of £170,000 in cash, including £805 in an envelope marked 'For the mujahedin in Chechnya'.

Videos of his sermons were found in the Hamburg flat used by some of the 9/11 hijackers.

As fears of a domestic terror threat grew after those attacks, he thwarted every attempt by the Government to detain and deport him; he went on the run to avoid being detained without trial or charged under new anti-terror laws.

After 10 months on the run he was discovered in a council house in south London, arrested and taken to Belmarsh high-security prison.

Qatada was released in March 2005 and put under a 22-hour home curfew designed to limit contact with other extremists.

He was rearrested months later but ministers were thwarted in their efforts to deport him because of fears he would be tortured if he returned to Jordan.

As the court battle continued, Qatada was released in June 2008 to live in his £800,000 council house in west London before being rearrested that November over fears he would breach his bail conditions.

In 2008, the Court of Appeal ruled in Qatada's favour, saying there were reasonable grounds for believing he would be denied a fair trial in Jordan because evidence against him could have been extracted through torture.

But in a landmark judgement in February 2009, five Law Lords unanimously backed the Government's policy of removing terror suspects from Britain on the basis of assurances from foreign governments.

Lord Phillips, now president of the Supreme Court, went further, saying that evidence of torture in another country 'does not require the UK to retain in this country, to the detriment of national security, a terrorist suspect'.

Qatada has always denied claims that he is al Qaeda's European ambassador, and insists he never met Osama bin Laden.
