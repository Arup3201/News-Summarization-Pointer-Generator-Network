Campaign: Miriam Clegg, wife of deputy prime minister Nick, said there needs to be more role models for women

Nick Clegg’s wife has claimed women do not have enough role models to aspire to, and are too often labelled as ‘fluffy’ or ‘shallow’.

Miriam Clegg, a lawyer, said women ‘face a series of stark choices’, while men can ‘toy with unlimited options’.

Mrs Clegg, known as Miriam Gonzalez Durantez professionally, said women are described as ‘scary’ if they are successful in their careers, ‘shallow’ if they follow fashion and ‘fluffy’ if they read women’s magazines.

Mrs Clegg, a partner at European law firm Dechert LLP, said it was not surprising that many young girls struggled to find their identity.

She added that there needed to be more visible female role models for girls to succeed.

She quoted figures from Girlguiding UK, which claims 55 per cent of girls aged between 11 and 21 feel there are not enough female role models.

On the contrary Mrs Clegg, who has three children with deputy prime minister Mr Clegg, said there was a ‘surplus’ of female role models. 

As a result, she is helping to launch a national campaign, called Inspiring the Future, which will encourage women from all backgrounds to visit schools and talk to girls about their jobs.

Mrs Clegg said: ‘I believe that every woman has a role model inside her:  the role models of our everyday lives.’ 

She added: ‘It is little wonder that girls struggle, amid so many absurd labels, struggle to identify the right path for them. 

‘As it is equally little wonder that, when threatened with that same flurry of labels, many female role models refuse to stick their necks out.

‘And yet while men are able to toy with unlimited options, we still face a series of stark choices. 

‘If we do not have children, people assume we are “frustrated”. If we stay at home taking care of our children, it is said we are “not working”.

‘If we have a job, we are portrayed as just “part-time mums”, and sometimes even as bad parents. 

‘If we succeed in our professional lives, we’re branded “scary”; if we follow fashion, we’re “shallow”; if we like science, we’re “geeks”; if we read women’s magazines, we’re “fluffy”, and if we defend our rights, we’re “hard”.’

The campaign will start with a ‘career speed-dating’ event on October 17, in which 100 girls from London state schools will meet ten successful women.

After the first event, the charity will continue to encourage women to speak for one hour about their career in state schools.

She told the Telegraph: ‘It is our duty to guarantee that all that potential does not go to waste. Those girls should not have to limit their dreams and feel constrained by absurd and demeaning stereotypes. 

‘They should rather feel free to aim high – high in their jobs, and high in their lives.

‘The new generation of girls are clever, engaged and curious; they are ambitious, but in a realistic way; they are not afraid of hard work and they are determined to shine.’
