Born Grant, Jessica Gillien, 20, always felt as though he was trapped in the wrong body.

Making the brave decision to live as a woman Jessica has had to endure taunts, stalkers and even death threats.

After doing a modelling shoot with a friend, Jessica, from Scotland, found it boosted her confidence and feeling of femininity hugely and that it also offered her a platform to champion the rights of transgendered people.

Jessica only began modelling six months ago when a friend asked her to pose in a shoot for her

Even as a child (left) Jessica felt she was trapped in a male body, and by age 14 (right) was experimenting with make-up and dressing as a woman 

'Ever since I was young I wanted to dress up in girls' clothes and I remember aged three my favourite toy was a Barbie doll. By the time I was 14 I was experimenting with new looks and ways I could look like a girl so that I could be myself and not be judged for being trans.

‘I went to a celeb lookalike party as a woman and everyone said how great i looked and from then on I decided I wanted to be a woman when I was older.

‘At the age of 15 I told my mum that I wanted to be a female. She was supportive but apprehensive and scared for me as I made the decision at such a young age.

'We agreed to wait until I was older before I made any changes or started taking hormones and looking into surgery, but by the age 17 I couldn't wait any longer.'

Jessica has faced stalking, abuse and even death threats for being transgender

‘I felt like a woman, I dressed like a woman, and deep down I knew I was always meant to be a woman. I started to dress like a girl and went to the doctors to speak about hormones and how to get the ball rolling. My friends and family were supportive but it’s not been easy.

‘I've had stalkers and death threats, even hate crimes but the worst of these ones were settled in court.

‘I haven't undergone any surgery yet but have been taking steroids for over a year now and I love the way I look.

‘I may consider surgery in the future but at the moment nobody thinks I’m a man so I may stay natural.

Jessica began modelling six months ago when a friend asked her to pose in a shoot for her.

‘It was amazing, I felt empowered, sexy. It was the most like a woman I'd ever felt.

‘A
 photographer from London asked if he could shoot me and I said yes, to 
this day I think he thinks I’m a girl. Well, I am… but you know what I 
mean!!

‘Since then I’ve done more and more shoots and it’s my mission to become the first ever published Trans glamour model.

‘Being trans gives you a larger sense of
 achievement when you do things like this as its proving everyone wrong,
 it’s been so hard over the years and all the changes I’ve gone through 
both mentally and physically but I look in the mirror and it’s all been 
worth it.

Jessica says in front of a camera is where she feels her most confident and sexy

‘I look the best I’ve ever looked and all my friends and family are behind me so I’m going to do this. I won’t stop until Trans is fully accepted in our culture today - it’s my mission and I WILL make it happen!

‘I’d love to help any other confused girls and boys out there who are trans and scared to be themselves. Nobody should be ashamed to be who they want to be.’
