Forget smartwatches and Google Glass, you can now turn yourself into a walking Wi-Fi hotspot with this high-tech onesie.

The BB.Suit is built using a mix between a circular knitting machine and 3D printer in which copper wire is woven inside layers of cotton.

This wire is then connected to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS chips built into the fabric, while batteries and processors are hidden inside built-in pockets. 

Dutch designer Borre Akkersdijk demonstrated the Wi-Fi cotton and copper BB.Suit, pictured, at this year's SXSW festival in Texas. Copper wires built into the fabric are connected to chips including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS, while batteries and processors are hidden inside built-in pockets

Copper is woven into the onesie during manufacturing.

Large spaces are left open within the design to leave room for the chips. 

Dutch fashion designer Borre Akkersdijk 
has created two prototype garments.

They include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS chips, which he demonstrated at this year’s
 SXSW festival in Texas.

The batteries and processors are hidden inside the pockets. 

As a result, the onesie can be customised in terms of colour as well as connectivity - and chips can be replaced.

But it can't be washed, because the chips are not waterproof.

Dutch fashion designer Borre Akkersdijk has developed two prototype BB.Suits and successfully demonstrated them at this year’s SXSW festival in Texas.

Akkersdijk began experimenting with the concept in 2009.

During SXSW, Akkersdijk asked musicians to upload tracks to a website that used the suit, and the model’s location, as a ‘walking URL.’

Akkersdijk’s fashion label ByBorre is based in Amsterdam, and although the prototypes were tested successfully, he doesn’t have plans to launch the clothing any time soon.

‘If we really want to create a wearable platform we would need to overcome a lot of problems where tech and textile and clothing meet,' Akkersdijk told Wired.

Akkersdijk is now working with tech companies to create a smart clothing platform and develop his BB.Suit, pictured, further. This includes making the garment less bulky and more comfortable in hot weather. He also said more work needs to be done in developing waterproof chips, so the onesie can be washed easily
