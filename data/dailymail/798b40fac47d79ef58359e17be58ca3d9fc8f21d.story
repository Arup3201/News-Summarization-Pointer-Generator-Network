Victim: John Lee Barrett, 31, was stabbed during in a Rochdale bar in the early hours of Christmas morning. He died on Tuesday

A man stabbed to death during a mass brawl at a private party on Christmas Day was a drug dealer celebrating his release from jail, it emerged today.

John Lee Barrett, 31, had just completed a six-year prison sentence for helping run a cocaine packaging factory in Manchester.

But as he toasted his release, he was fatally stabbed after up to 20 people gatecrashed a private function at Sinclairs Bar in Rochdale.

Barrett was found dying nearby at 2.40am on Christmas morning shortly after a string of fights broke out inside the venue. He was taken to hospital with stab wounds but died on Tuesday.

Police believe he had been hit over the head with either a glass or bottle before he was stabbed.

By
the time police arrived at the venue, bouncers had already ejected a 
number of people from inside the club who ran away before officers could
speak to them.

Detectives are now appealing to anyone with information to come forward.

Chief Superintendent John O’Hare 
said: 'It is incredibly sad that someone has been killed during a night 
out and our thoughts are with John’s family and friends.

'We are continuing to appeal to those
in or around the club to come forward, and are especially keen to speak
to those who had been ejected by door staff before police arrived.

'Clearly, they have vital information that will assist our investigation and are key witnesses.

'Regardless of what you saw and 
whether or not you think it is relevant, it is extremely important you 
contact us so we can build as full a picture as possible to establish 
exactly what happened.

Barrett, from Harpurhey, Manchester, 
was jailed in 2008 after police observed him arriving at a flat in 
nearby Cheetham Hill in his Mercedes with two other men, then carrying 
items used for drug-making into the property.

The
officers raided the flat to discover a drugs press capable of moulding 
1kg blocks of cocaine, scales and a food blender bearing traces of the 
drug.

A further search of 
the flat uncovered a self-loading pistol wrapped inside a plastic 
carrier bag, which had been stashed in a utility cupboard.

Barrett,
the owner of the flat Kevin Faulkner - who was described by police as a
'dangerous' man - and a third gangster were arrested.

At Barrett’s then-home in Bolton officers recovered 51 grams of heroin with a street value of over £5,000.

Barrett
was later convicted of conspiracy to supply class A drugs and 
possession with intent to supply class A drugs in March 2008 and 
breaching the the terms of his licence from a previous jail term.

But he was recently freed after serving half his jail term.

Faulkner is still serving eight-and-a-half years behind bars for drugs and firearms offences.
