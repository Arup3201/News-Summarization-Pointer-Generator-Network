Peter Andre has launched a scathing attack on ex-wife Katie Price's whirlwind third wedding, raging at friends: 'What kind of example does this set for our children?'

In shocking new claims, it has emerged the Mysterious Girl singer only discovered former glamour model Katie, 34, had married stripper Kieran Hayler, after a six week romance, by reading it online.

It was reportedly a distressing blow to Andre, 39, who was looking after the couple's children, Princess, five, and Junior, seven, at the time and had 'no idea what to tell them'.

The singer, who is still grieving the death of his brother Andrew, told friends: 'Kate thinks of marriage and divorce like most people think of buying something and returning it if it goes wrong.

'What does that say to Princess?'

The pal revealed to Now magazine that Andre was shocked at the news Katie had secretly wed Kieran, who has appeared as a stripper in BBC 1 soap EastEnders, in an intimate Caribbean wedding with just six guests.

It is thought Pete's first concern was the impact another husband would have on his children's life and what they are learning about marriage.

A source told Closer magazine: 'Pete's worried Princess thinks getting married is an everyday thing. He's told the kids it's a special commitment to a person you love and want to spend the rest of your life with.

'He doesn't give a t**s about her marrying again, but he can't believe she'd do this to the kids. they'd only just got used to Leo. He wishes she would act her age - not her boyfriend's.'

Another friend spilled the beans to Heat: 'The kids have had three different men living in that house since Katie and Pete split up, and he's worried it could be distressing for them.'

Friends have speculated that since Pete  split from his wife in 2009, Katie's mission has been to make her ex jealous and she wanted to beat Pete, who is happily dating medical student Emily MacDonagh, to getting hitched.

Since Katie and Pete split in 2009, businesswoman Katie married cage-fighting drag queen Alex Reid in February 2010 before splitting in January 2011.

In claims which will devastate Katie Price bodybuilder Jodie Marsh has revealed Kieran Hayler pursued her on twitter.

The former model has labelled the stripper 'fame hungry'.

Jodie claims she was bombarded with messages from gym enthusiast Kieran, telling Heat: 'He was obsessed with me... I started to believe he was one of those "party boys" -boys who just want to get with someone famous.'

The messages began ten months ago, when Kieran sent Jodie snaps of himself in his underwear adding he wanted to help her out with her fitness range.

Jordan and Jodie famously fell out after a spat more than ten years ago over surgically enhanced breasts.

Jodie added: 'I almost feel sorry for Katie now.'

She then met Argentine model Leandro Penna in February 2011 at an Oscars' party before getting swiftly engaged in April 2012 - they had split by last October and her former lover later said she had a 'crazy mind.'

'Kate's completely crazy - she honestly believes every man she marries will make Pete jealous, ' a friend of Pete's said.

Although Katie has gushed about her marriage and how brilliant her new gym enthusiast husband is, close friends of the reality star are thought to be worried about her diving in to marriage so soon, including her usual stanch supporter, mother Amy.

A friend told Closer: 'Amy is worried about the whole thing. She says that Kieran is just a boy and he has no idea about what is to come.'

But never one to encourage the critics, mother-of-three Katie, who has made no secret of her desire to have another baby and some say Pricey is thought to be expecting already.

'Katie told pals she thinks she is pregnant and that it could be twins. She's overjoyed.'

A spokeswoman denied that Katie was expecting twins but did not comment on pregnancy rumours.

Pete is said to be concentrating on his own life and recently celebrated his six month anniversary with his 23-year-old lover.

There have been rumours Pete may be planning to marry Emily, which sources say could have pushed Katie over the edge.

A spokesman for Pete said he has not spoken publicly to any family or friends about his ex's new nuptials.

Katie married Kieran in an intimate Bahamas ceremony and the reality star is thought to have talked to her children before tying the knot.

Just hours after Pete's alleged reaction came to light Katie hit out at 'people surrounding her ex' and added that she refused to get into an argument affecting her children.

In a statement posted on her website, Katie writes:Â  'I know my marriage to Kieran is going to attract criticism and that there will be people selling stories on the back of their perception of me and my decision.

'I will take that criticism on the chin and argue my corner where I feel it is necessary. What I won't do is get dragged into a tit for tat argument with Pete about the children to be played out in public - they are old enough to read these things.

She adds, in an apparent scathing attack on her former management company CAN associates: 'I know he has people around him that would want him to do an article running me down if I took up stamp collecting let alone get married quickly but I believe him to be a bigger man than that.

'If Pete has an issue or concerns, he has my number. Pete is a good father - everyone knows he loves our Children. So do I.

'Our Children are happy and healthy as he knows. I discussed with them at length what I was doing and why. I wish Pete nothing but love and luck with his relationship with Emily who seems delightful.'
