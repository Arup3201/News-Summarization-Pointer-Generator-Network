Marion 'Suge' Knight has been rushed to hospital over stomach problems related to last summer's shooting where he was wounded six times.

Knight, 49, had been due in a Los Angeles courtroom on Thursday to face robbery charges after he and rapper Katt Williams allegedly stole a paparazzo's camera last September. 

The rap mogul was being transferred to court this morning when he fell ill and was taken by ambulance to hospital.

Marion 'Suge' Knight (right), next to his attorney David E Kenner, is arraigned on murder charges in Compton, California on February 3. 

His lawyer, David Kenner, told TMZ  that Knight had suffered bleeding in the stomach as part of a number of health problems following the nightclub shooting.

There was no update on his condition.  

Knight, 49, also faces charges of murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run after authorities said he ran down and killed one man and seriously injured another in a parking lot on January 29. 

Knight has pleaded not guilty. 

Authorities allege Knight killed Terry Carter, 55, and injured another, Cle 'Bone' Sloan, 51, with his pickup truck near a film set in Compton, California. Police said he fled the scene.

Knight was out on bail in the separate robbery case at the time. His lawyer claimed that Knight was ambushed and feared for his life prior to the hit-and-run.  

The music producer was earlier hospitalized on February 3 when he had a panic attack moments after pleading not guilty to all charges.

Armed guards reportedly watched over Knight in hospital. 

TMZ reported that doctors discovered he had a blood clot and he was treated with blood thinners.

Knight's blood clots have been an ongoing health problem for him since he was shot last August at 1Oak Nightclub in West Hollywood.

He returned to court on February 9 where a judge ordered him to stay behind bars until his next hearing.  

Knight is the co-founder of Death Row Records, which once boasted Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg on its books.
