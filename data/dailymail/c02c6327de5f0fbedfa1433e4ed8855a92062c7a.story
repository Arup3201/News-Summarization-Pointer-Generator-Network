It's the face that has taken the internet by storm - and now it seems that McKayla Maroney's unimpressed pout has spread to television screens.

The 16-year-old Olympic gymnast became the focus of online comedians when she failed to hide her anger over an embarrassing tumble during the London Games.

But the pretty brunette has proved her sense of humour, again, by making the same face during an appearance on The Colbert Report two days ago.

Posing as interns, she and her 'Fierce Five' teammates performed a series of impressive gymnastics tricks before coming together to smile and wave to the audience as a group. But while the other girls were noticeably beaming, Miss Maroney barely managed a smile, lifting her arm up only slightly to offer a half-hearted wave.

That pout: McKayla Maroney has appeared with her Fierce Five teammates on The Colbert Report, her sourpuss face on full display. The team posed as Stephen Colbert's interns during the episode

Not happy: Her face was made famous when she accepted a silver medal during the Games, above

Clearly playing up to her fans who can't seem to get enough of the disgruntled look, and have, as a result, Photoshopped photos of hers in several hilarious scenarios online, she stayed in character during the groups' entire appearance.

It follows the equally-funny picture she posted of herself on Twitter last week that captured her and fellow U.S. gymnasts Kyla Ross and Aly Raisman pulling the notorious face.

During the Colbert episode, which aired on Wednesday night, the U.S. gymnastics team which also consists of Miss Ross, Miss Raisman, Jordyn Wieber and Gabby 
Douglas, each posed as the host's eager assistants.

In a highly-amusing comedy sketch, the 
five teens are seen back-flipping, cartwheeling and hand-standing their 
way over to the show's host from behind the curtains in order to drop 
off a pen to his desk.

Demanding: Team USA's 'Fierce Five' Olympic gymnastics team have appeared on The Colbert Report where host Stephen Colbert (above) asked the teenagers to deliver a pen to him. They do so in spectacular style

Work it: A Colbert crew member (left) offered the pen to the 'interns'. Gabby Douglas (right) snapped it up first

Mr Colbert starts out by telling his audience that he has 'a new batch of interns and they might be the best ones to date'.

'Five bright young women who just returned from some kind of study abroad program in London,' he continues. 'Anyway, they're very helpful and, you know what, speaking of which, I don't have my pen... could somebody bring me my pen please?'

Jay 'the intern', who looks to be just one of the show's crew members, then holds a pen out in the air before saying: Can you get this to Stephen?'

Miss Douglas, 16, pops out on the stage, snapping the pen up from Jay's hands before striking a pose for the camera which sends the unsuspecting audience wild with delight as they begin to realise who the host's new interns are.

Skills: Miss Douglas launches into an impressive cartwheel after she lodges the pen between her teeth

Passing it on: Like a relay baton, Miss Douglas passes the pen onto McKayla Maroney before she somersaults

Impressive: Miss Mahoney (left) is seen performing a fantastic somersault before landing in a perfect dismount

Success: Miss Maroney then passes the pen onto Aly Raisman (right) who uses it to spin and high-kick

The Flying Squirrel then lodges the pen between her teeth as she takes to the floor to perform a cartwheel before passing the pen over to McKayla Maroney, 16, who has just popped out from behind another curtain.

As the crowd continues to cheer and clap, Miss Maroney lodges the pen between her own teeth and proceeds to perform a somersault on a long mat that has been spread across the ground.

The teen dismounts perfectly, taking the pen out from her teeth before placing a hand on her hip to strike her own pose towards the audience.

Aly Raisman, 18, then takes centre stage, who performs two spins with the same pen, given to her by Miss Maroney, in her hand and then a high kick.

As she performs, Mr Colbert is shown, glued to the girls' every move as though he were watching them compete at the Olympics once again.

Continues: Miss Raisman (right) then passes the all-important pen onto 15-year-old Kyla Ross (right)

Back-flip: Miss Ross performs a double back-flip on another mat that has been laid onto the studio floor

Finally: The pen is then passed to Miss Wieber (left) who proceeds to stand on her hands and walk to the host

Kyla Ross, 15, then takes the pen from Miss Maroney before placing the pen between her own teeth and launching into an impressive double back-flip performance on another mat that has been laid out.

Finally, Jordyn Wieber, 17, takes the pen herself and slips it between her toes, stepping into a walking handstand that ends with the show's host snatching it from her foot as it comes towards him.

The comedian then launches into his own comical dismount, which attracts a standing ovation from the excited crowd.

The end: The TV host reaches out for the pen, which is lodged between Miss Wieber's foot (pictured)

Mission completed: Mr Colbert launches into his own ridiculous dismount as he takes hold of the pen

Fierce Five: The entire squad then comes together to wave to the audience who offer a rousing applause

The five girls then take to the centre 
of the stage in order to wave to the crowd as a team united, much like 
the scene at their gold medal presentation ceremony in London.

A close-up of Miss Maroney shows a sour expression as she stays in character with the low-level intern she is portraying.

To top the entertainment off, the camera then rolls over to the girls' mothers including Miss Douglas' mom Natalie Hawkins, who pretend to be asleep in the audience.

Sticking together: The group were photographed atop the Empire State Building (above) two days ago

'That was beautiful,' the host concludes before noting that he actually wanted a black pen, not the blue one that was delivered to him.

The team are currently in the thick of a jam-packed publicity schedule that has seen some of its members appear on other talk shows and breakfast programs.
