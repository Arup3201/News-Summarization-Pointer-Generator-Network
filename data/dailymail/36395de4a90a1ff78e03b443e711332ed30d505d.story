Every foreign prisoner deported from Britain is replaced in jail by another criminal from overseas, a damning report revealed today.

While 1,000 inmates are sent home every three months, the same number of new foreign offenders are locked up by the courts.

Parliament’s spending watchdog condemned the Government's ‘frustratingly poor’ record on kicking out foreign criminals who are costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds.

There are almost 11,00 foreign criminals in jail, and those deported are replaced by new inmates

Four years ago David Cameron promised a crackdown after it emerged that more than 11,000 foreign inmates are clogging up our jails.

But since then almost no progress has been made in bringing the number down.

The Commons Public Accounts Committee found that the rate foreign inmates are sent home has dropped by 14 per cent over the past four years.

The committee's chair, Labour MP Margaret Hodge, said: ‘Performance in reducing the number of foreign national prisoners continues to be frustratingly poor, costing the taxpayer hundreds of millions of pounds.

‘While more than 1,000 foreign national offenders are deported each quarter, a similar number are convicted, so the overall number of foreign national prisoners stays at the same level of around 11,000 – 13 per cent of the total prison population.

‘The agency should work with the Home Office to understand why there are delays in removing foreign national offenders, and tackle the barriers to their removal.’

Top 10 countries foreign prisoners come from

In December, the National Audit Office said speeding up the removal of foreign prisoners was the best way to reduce the bill for jails.

The PAC said the National Offender Management Service (Noms) ‘should work with the Home Office to better understand the reasons for delays in removing foreign national offenders, tackle the barriers to removal, and take all steps to improve performance in this area’.

Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said: ‘The foreign national prisoner population is lower than it was in 2010 and reducing it further is a top priority for this Government.

‘We are working hard to reduce the numbers in our prison system - in 2012 alone we deported more than 4,500 foreign criminals from the UK.’

But Labour’s shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: ‘David Cameron's terrible record on failing to send home foreign prisoners also rightly comes in for criticism.

‘Back in 2010, he promised to personally intervene to send thousands back to their home countries.

‘With only a handful actually sent back, this broken promise is clogging up our jails and costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds.’
