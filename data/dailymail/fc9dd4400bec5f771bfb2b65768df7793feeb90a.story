Former World Cup winners Romario and Bebeto were among the Brazilian footballers elected to parliament in elections this weekend.

Romario, who was a deputy in the lower house, was elected Senator for Rio de Janeiro with 63 per cent of the vote.

The 48-year-old has consistently spoken out against corruption in Brazilian football and is part of the Brazilian Socialist Party

Bebeto, his strike partner when Brazil won the World Cup in 1994, was re-elected as a state deputy.

Andres Sanchez, the former president of Sao Paulo club Corinthians, was elected to the lower house for the Workers' Party. 

Romario had a playing career that spanned almost 25 years and played for clubs such as PSV, Barcelona, Vasco da Gama and Flamengo.

Bebeto, who played for the same two Rio de Janeiro based clubs, went into politics in 2010 as a representative of the Democratic Labour Party.
