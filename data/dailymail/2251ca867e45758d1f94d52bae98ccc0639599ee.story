A stricken puppy is in desperate need of a total 'facelift' to prevent his sight from being permanently damaged.

Wrinkly-featured Ted, a Chinese Shar Pei who was recently rescued from a household in Suffolk, suffers from a rare condition which causes folds of skin to rub against his eyes.

Pampered Pets, near Woodbridge, is now hoping to re-home the animal and raise £1,000 for the facelift.

Eight-month-old Ted arrived at the rescue centre and luxury kennels on Sunday after concerned officers took him away from his previous owners.

Jane Lee, owner of Pampered Pets, which also takes in strays picked up by Suffolk Coastal’s dog warden, said: ‘Ted is adorable.

‘He loves everybody but his life was being made miserable and we were asked to take him in.

‘He came to us full of fleas and with a skin problem.’

She added: ‘We bathed him and took him to the vets but found out that he needs a facelift or it could become much worse.’

Emma White, who works at the kennels, 
said: ‘Ted’s not had a great start in life and he’s a lucky boy to have 
come in to be cared for by us.’

Ted suffers from a condition which, if left untreated, could cause permanent sight problems. The surgery he requires will cost about £1,000.

Ted is not the only homeless dog at Pampered Pets, where several dogs of varying breeds are still waiting to find new owners.

Any animal lovers who can urgently offer Ted or another vulnerable dog a new home and a new life should call Pampered Pets on 01728 747760 as soon as possible.
