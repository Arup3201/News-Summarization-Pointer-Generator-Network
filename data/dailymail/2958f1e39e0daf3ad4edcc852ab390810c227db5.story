A caffeine-loving robber was being hunted today after holding up a newsagents armed with a cup of coffee.

The masked bandit has been dubbed Britain's most carefree raider after casually strolling into the shop holding a mug of black coffee in his right hand then calmly asking the sales assistant to empty the stock of cigarettes into four bin bags.

He also stole cash from the Oasis News store in Wythenshawe, Manchester, before walking out.

Easy raider: This masked bandit was caught on CCTV holding up a newsagents in Manchester armed with just a cup of black coffee as he made off with four bin bags full of cigarettes and tobacco

Nonchalant: The caffeine-loving robber's accomplice doesn't even worry about covering his face as he enters the store. Police have released these images in the hope someone will come forward with information

He did disguise himself in a bandana and a hooded jacket, but he was with an equally casual accomplice who didn’t even cover his face despite security cameras capturing every moment of the 10.45am hold-up on New Year's Day.

Greater Manchester Police today issued CCTV of the raid at the store and said both robbers were 'clearly nonchalant' in their attitude to the raid.

A shop assistant at a neighbouring store said: 'We couldn’t believe it when we heard what this guy was carrying when he went into the shop. Normally you hear of robbers carrying guns, knives and coshes - but never one carrying a cup of coffee.

'Obviously, it must have been terrifying for the shop assistant to be told to hand over the money, but some people round here have been joking as to whether the robber asked for milk and two sugars too.'

Laissez-faire: The raid was carried out at around 10.45am on New Year's Day at Oasis News in Manchester

Another local said: 'It’s just typical of the way robbers behave these days. They didn’t seem to have a care in the world and this robber must be the most carefree around. He must take being casual to a whole new dimension.'

Police said the two robbers handed a bin bag to a cashier and demanded he fill it with cigarettes and tobacco.

In total, four bin bags were filled with cigarettes and tobacco. The men also stole cash from the till.

As part of the subsequent investigation, two men, both aged 25, have been charged with conspiracy to commit robbery and are awaiting trial. But the men in the CCTV images have yet to be traced.

Now the CCTV images of the two men who carried out the robbery have been released and police are appealing for anyone who knows them to get in touch.

Det Con Matthew Farrell, of West Didsbury CID, said: 'We have carried out a thorough investigation into this incident and while we have charged two people, we now need to trace the two men in the CCTV.

'These two offenders are clearly nonchalant in their attitude to this crime: one has made no attempt to conceal his face and the other is casually carrying round a hot drink.

'Someone will almost certainly know who they are and I would urge those people to contact me.'
