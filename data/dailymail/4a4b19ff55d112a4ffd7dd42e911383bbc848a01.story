When an amateur chef presented a sloppy sunken souffle to judges on MasterChef he must have feared he was in for some stern criticism.

But to the surprise of viewers, the critics were full of praise for the 'absolutely stunning' dish which moments later had mysteriously risen.

Now bosses on the BBC One programme have been accused on fixing the scenes in order to show the souffle, cooked by a 26-year-old plasterer Tom Rennolds, standing proudly.

Viewers watched as earlier in the show Mr Rennolds  boasted: 'I haven't had one souffle sink yet'.

Flop: Chef Tom Rennolds presents his collapsed pineapple and chilli souffle to the judges on the popular BBC 1 show MasterChef

Standing proudly: Moments later the footage cuts to another version of the savoury dish, but unlike the previous attempt this one has risen perfectly

His efforts were less impressive though, and he presented a disappointing sunken dish to judges on the popular cooking show on February 1.

The the amazement of viewers, the judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace were seen tucking into a perfect pineapple and chilli soufflé.

The edited scenes raised the prospect that show producers had duped viewers by ignoring the failed dish. 

Some questioned whether Mr Rennolds, from Silsden, West Yorkshire, had been given several attempts at getting the notoriously tricky meal right.

Wanna-be chefs on the reality show are sent home at the end of each episode if they fail to impress the judges.

But the tall, dark-haired contestant is a former manual labourer, and would prove a popular winner of the show. He is already the favourite to win the competition.

The show began with the contestants being split into two teams. Eight of them were later given 90 minutes in the MasterChef kitchen to produce their best meal.

What's that? Mr Rennolds, a plasterer, serves up the souffle to food critics John Torode and Gregg Wallace who are clearly unimpressed by the attempt at the tricky dish

Deflated: Mr Rennolds, 26, is almost as sunken as his souffle as he watches the judges sample his dish

Surprise: Judge Mr Wallace tucks into the dish, which he says is 'absolutely stunning'. The scene had been edited to show the souffle looking all fluffy again and the chef was put through to the next round

Earlier in the show, Australian judge
John Torode said: ‘Today he really has got to deliver good quality 
food, free of mistakes. He says it's never gone wrong before, there's 
always a first time.'

Mr Wallace added: 'He makes lots of silly mistakes.'

The
savoury main course or dessert, which can have different fillings 
added, is made with egg yolks and beaten egg whites but is notoriously 
difficult to get right.

Mr Rennolds chose to cook a chilli and pineapple souffle with coconut and ginger ice cream.

Viewers
were shown Mr Rennolds placing two of the ‘very daring’ dishes into the
oven.  It appears that one of the soufflés had risen but the other was a
failure.

The collapsed dish was given to the judges but the TV programme showed them eating the one that had risen. A second shot moments later also showed the souffle that had turned out well.

Mr Rennolds was praised for his ‘absolutely stunning’ efforts and put through to the next round of the cooking show, which is in its eight series. The other four contestants were criticised but they were allowed to stay in.

Mr Wallace said: That's lovely. Datey, elegant, beautiful. Stunning, absolutely stunning.

'As light as a feather, sunshine sweet and a little bit of chilli heat prickling your tongue.'

It is unclear just why the footage that was broadcast earlier this year showed both of the dishes.

A source close to the show told the Daily Mirror that contestant chefs were often given the chance to cook two souffles because of the ‘temperamental nature’ of the lightly-baked cake.

A BBC spokesman added: 'Any suggestion that Tom was allowed several attempts to create a perfect meal is completely untrue.  Contestants always make more than one soufflé.  As time is called at the end of cooking they must put only one up to be filmed, tasted and judged. 

'We always shoot the soufflés as soon as time is called and cooking is finished. Then filming the judging continues by which time soufflés have naturally deflated.

'This doesn't affect the tasting or judging at all as the souffle taste remains the same and of course the judges have seen how it looks when first plated up.  We always cut back to the shot of the food as it was when first plated up as a reminder of how the dish looked before the tasting.'

The company that produces MasterChef, Shine TV, has already faced questions about altering scenes in shows. It was forced to apologise after using computer trickery to show huge crowds meeting Gordon Ramsay when the show launched in the U.S. There were only a fraction of the people who had turned up for the launch.

It later emerged that in the Australian version of the hugely-popular show contestants were given the chance to ‘re-plate’ their creations between scenes.

The executive producer of the Australian show admitted at the time: ‘On rare occasions both the contestant and the celebrity chef in MasterChef’s celebrity chef challenge are offered the opportunity to re-plate their dishes between the completion of the challenge and the tasting of the dish.’
