10. AC Milan 4-0 Arsenal, Champions League - February 15, 2012

The Gunners faced AC Milan in a double header for a place in the Champions League quarter-finals in February 2012 but saw the tie ultimately decided at the halfway stage as Arsene Wenger's side succumbed to a heavy 4-0 defeat.

Arsenal's hopes of progressing were left in tatters as a Kevin Prince-Boateng strike, Robinho double and Zlatan Ibrahimovic penalty gave the Serie A giants a comprehensive victory.

The north Londoners did regain some pride with a valiant 3-0 win at home but the damage was done and the Gunners were out.

The defeat was the start of four consecutive last 16 losses for the Gunners.

9. Arsenal 1-3 Monaco, Champions League - February 25, 2015

Having been paired up with German powerhouse Bayern Munich for the last two Champions League campaigns, Arsenal fans breathed a sigh of relief when they avoided the Bundesliga champions and were instead drawn against French side Monaco. 

Seen as one of the 'easier' ties in the last 16, Arsenal fans went into the game full of confidence. However, the mood soon changed as Monaco took advantage of Arsenal's lethargic display and took the lead through Geoffrey Kondogbia's deflected effort.

Wenger's side failed to improve after the break as things went from bad to worse. Former Tottenham and Manchester United frontman Dimitar Berbatov sauntered through to score before substitute Yannick Ferreira Carrasco extended Monaco's advantage following Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's curling consolation.

Arsenal have it all to do at Stade Louis II in the return leg but still have a slight chance of progressing and salvaging some pride.

8. Arsenal 1-2 Birmingham, League Cup final - February 27, 2011

Arsenal went in to the 2011 Capital One Cup final as major favourites but gifted the trophy to Alex McLeish's Birmingham after a horror defensive mix-up.

With the game seemingly heading into extra-time after Robin van Persie cancelled out Nicola Zigic's opener, Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny missed a relatively easy clearance before clattering in to the onrushing Wojciech Szczesny which allowed Obafemi Martins to steal in and clinch the game for the Blues.

Arsenal versus Manchester United was the definitive Premier League rivalry of the 90s and early 2000s making 2001's 6-1 onslaught particularly difficult to take for the travelling Gunners.

Arsene Wenger's men were 5-1 down at half-time as Dwight Yorke claimed a hat-trick on just 21 minutes after Thierry Henry's initial equaliser.

United midfielders Roy Keane and Nicky Butt scored before half-time before former Tottenham striker Teddy Sheringham hit Arsenal for six in the 89th minute.

Newcastle staged an incredible comeback through Leon Best and two Barton spot-kicks before Cheick Tiote rifled home a stunning left-foot volley which  past a helpless Wojciech Szczesny.

Cue  Geordie jubilation and disbelieving despair for the travelling Gunners.

5. Tottenham 5-1 Arsenal, League Cup - January 22, 2008

It's never easy losing to your fierce, local rivals but to see Arsenal players falling out during a mauling by Tottenham was a bitter pill to swallow for the red half of north London.

As if Tottenham running riot wasn't enough, the sight of Nicklas Bendtner in a heated exchange with goalscorer Emmanuel Adebayor before arguing with William Gallas made for miserable viewing.

The Gunners were then left to watch as Tottenham celebrated booking their place in the League Cup final at the expense of their rivals. A night to forget for Wenger and Co.

4. Manchester United 8-2 Arsenal, Premier League - August 28, 2011

Ten years on since the initial 6-1 embarrassment, Arsene Wenger was again left humiliated by old foe Sir Alex Ferguson.. and there was an even bigger deficit to contend with this time.

The manner of the defeat was brutal on the Frenchman and his young Arsenal side as the Red Devils completely wiped the floor with their opponents to produce one of the Premier League's biggest scorelines.  

'I'd 8-2 be an Arsenal fan' was recited for weeks and weeks after (mainly by smug United fans).

3. Liverpool 5-1 Arsenal, Premier League - February 8, 2014

Twennty minutes on the clock and the Anfield scoreboard made sickening read for the travelling faithful: Liverpool 4-0 Arsenal.

The Gunners looked completely shell-shocked as Brendan Rodgers side entered cruise control with seventy minutes of the game remaining after racing into a 4-0 lead in the opening quarter of the game.

Unlikely goalscorer Martin Skrtel had a double after ten minutes before Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge made it four. Sterling scored his second on 52 minutes to complete Liverpool's five-star performance before Mikel Arteta netted a consolation penalty. Unsuprisingly, not one Arsenal player was in the mood to celebrate as the game's end couldn't come quick enough. 

Arsene Wenger later took a tumble at Lime Street station to compound the Frenchman's humiliation on a horrible day on Merseyside.

2. Bradford 1-1 Arsenal (pens 3-2), League Cup - December 11, 2012

Arsene Wenger became victims of one of the biggest giant-killings of the modern era as Arsenal were put to the sword by League Two Bradford in the League Cup.

The defeat - on penalties after the game ended 1-1 - proved a major setback for Wenger's side who had lost won a trophy in 2005.

One of the Premier League's top sides had been made to look extremely ordinary having been tipped as comfortable favourites against a side three divisions below them.

1. Chelsea 6-0 Arsenal, Premier League - March 22, 2014

March 22, 2014 was a day Arsene Wenger would never forget as he led out Arsenal for the 1000th time. 

However, it soon became a match the Frenchman would rather forget as Chelsea ruined his landmark day by recording the Blues' biggest-ever win over their  rivals.

Arsenal were two down after seven minutes, saw Kieran Gibbs wrongly sent off for an Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain handball before shipping another four which handed Jose Mourinho - one of Wenger's fiercest touchline rivals - his biggest Premier League result.

Wenger admitted in the build-up to the clash that every defeat left 'a scar in your heart that you never forget'. This particular loss will remain etched in the memory for a very long time to come.
