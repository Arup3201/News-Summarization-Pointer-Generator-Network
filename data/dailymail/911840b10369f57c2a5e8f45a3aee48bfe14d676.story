A zoo in Australia claims it is home to the biggest and oldest common wombat in captivity.

Patrick the wombat weighs in at an astonish 79lbs (36kg) despite the average for its species being somewhere between that figure and 32lbs (15kg).

At 30 years old Patrick has also lived a lot longer than the expected age of a wombat.

Patrick's handler, Julia Leonard, said: ‘We believe he is the oldest common wombat in captivity.

‘To live that long is pretty good going. In the wild they probably only average 10 to 15 years.

‘But you know, he has got a happy home, good food and lots of cuddles so he is thriving.’

A resident at the Ballarat Wildlife Park in Victoria, Australia, the wombat initially appears to be an average size when it first features in the video.

But once it is picked up by its handler, the sheer size of the mammal is striking.

However, according to Ms Leonard, the wombat is actually lighter than it used to be.

‘Well he was 40kg in his heyday. Of course, as you get older you lose a bit of weight so he is about 36kg now,' said Ms Leonard.

According to Patrick's handler, Julia Leonard, in its 'heyday' the wombat weighed a whopping 40kg

Quite a handful! At 79lbs, Patrick is a lot heavier than the average wombat who weighs somewhere between that figure and 32lbs

Patrick has been in captivity nearly his entire life at the Ballarat Wildlife Park as – rather surprisingly – he couldn’t defend himself against other wombats in the wild.

Hand-raised after being orphaned as a baby, the wombat is famous in the park for greeting visitors while being pushed around in a wheelbarrow – as seen in the video.

With hundreds of thousands of fans, Patrick also has his own Facebook page and he was named the 3rd best 'city mascot' in the world back in 2014.
