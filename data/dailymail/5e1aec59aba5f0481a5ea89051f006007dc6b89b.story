A Danish television channel admitted yesterday it mistakenly used a screenshot from a computer game in a news report about Syria.

News anchor Cecilie Beck presented a segment about the conflict in the Middle Eastern country while sitting in front of a picture taken from adventure game Assassin's Creed.

Jacob Nybroe, head of news at TV2, has been forced to apologise after the blunder on February 26 was highlighted on social networking sites.

Danish media reported the image had been found on YouTube and mistakenly thought to be genuine

Danish media reported that a graphic designer had pulled the image of a picturesque Damascus skyline from YouTube to use in the report.

The feature was about the preservation of Syria's heritage and Danish news website Politiken reported that the employee believed it was a genuine picture.

It is thought the image is from the first game in the Assassin's Creed series when the action is set in historic Damascus, as well as other parts of the Middle East.

Mr Nybroe said he learned of the mistake this week following the online speculation.

He said the incident is a 'reminder to us all of the importance of verifying the sources of pictures.'

Mr Nybroe told Politiken that there 
had been a 'clear-cut error' and that it would have been even more 
serious had the employee taken the image directly from the computer 
game.

He added that the station has since implemented a new system so that correct images can be more easily found.

The news segment opened with an appropriate image of the Syrian flag before switching to the screenshot

Last year, ITV was strongly criticised by Ofcom after it mistakenly used a scene from the video game Arma 2 in a programme about an IRA attack.

Ofcom found the station to be in breach of broadcasting rules for claiming that the scene in Exposure: Gaddafi And The IRA was footage from an IRA film of IRA members attempting to shoot down a British Army helicopter in 1988.

The footage had been taken from the internet and ITV apologised and said it had not intended to mislead viewers.

In November 2012, ABC's Denver affiliate KMGH-TV also apologised after it broadcast a news segment in which it mistakenly ran a fake book cover alongside a story about the mistress and biographer of former CIA director David Petraeus.

The Paula Broadwell biography called 'All In' had been offensively doctored.

News director Jeff Harris called the incident 'a regrettable and an embarrassing error.'
