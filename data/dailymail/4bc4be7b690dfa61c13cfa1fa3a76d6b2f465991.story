John Terry has taken on his son in a game of head tennis in the pool on holiday and, ever the competitor, beat him conclusively.

The Chelsea defender uploaded the video to his Instagram page, which features him and his son heading the ball back and forth, before eventually his son succumbs to the pressure, leaving JT to come out victorious.

It wasn't a bad showing at all from the youngster, though, who seems to possess his the same technique in the air as his dad.

Back...

...and forth

And celebrate: John Terry celebrates the win with his son

Terry has been enjoying a summer off with his family, as England struggled without him at the World Cup following his international retirement.

Calls for Terry's integration back into the England set-up were voiced after the Three Lions registered only a point during this summer's showpiece in Brazil.

The centre-back retired from international duty in September 2012 after winning 78 caps and despite appeals for his reinstatement, Terry was omitted from Hodgson's World Cup squad, with the former club colleague Gary Cahill, Everton's Phil Jagielka and Manchester United duo Phil Jones and Chris Smalling being taken as the quartet of centre-backs.
