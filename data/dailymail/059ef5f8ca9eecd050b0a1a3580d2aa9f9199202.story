Children's happiness has been sacrificed in the obsessive race for exam results at state schools, a leading independent head teacher said yesterday.

Dr Tim Hands, chairman of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference, said it was assumed that academic success would lead to happiness, not the other way round.

Government education policy since the latter part of the 20th century had acted like a ‘dead restraining hand’, he argued, culminating in the ‘flawed’ reliance on school league tables.

Excessive interference: Dr Tim Hands, the Chairman of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference said it was assumed academic success would lead to happiness, not the other way around

‘The story of the last 50 years is the intrusion of Government and the disappearance of the child,’ said Dr Hands, Master of Magdalen College School, Oxford.

‘More radically put, it is by extension the intrusion of the State and the disappearance of love.

'The long, interfering arm and dead restraining hand of Government has emasculated the education system of this country.’ Labour ‘zeal for egalitarianism’ had been followed by the Tories’ fixation with ‘league table-driven academic excellence’, which meant ‘pastoral care has been distorted and down valued within the maintained sector’.

Dr Hands added: ‘The post-80s drive on academic standards was based on the mistaken belief that you do not need to make a child happy as your first priority, so that they can be successful as your second.

‘Indeed, it believed that if you make a child academically successful, then happiness will follow.’ This had led to ‘excessive curricular interference’.

‘Principles of commercial accountability were transferred to the education of the child. Hence the flawed mechanism and, still worse, flawed metric of league tables,’ he went on.

Dr Hands said independent schools had maintained their focus on  children’s well-being and were also better at providing extra-curricular activities.

He made his comments at the annual meeting of the conference, which represents more than 300 independent schools. The organisation was founded in 1869 amid an atmosphere of Victorian recognition of ‘the existence of the child’, he said.

‘It was the age when the child could ask for more and, newly, expect to be heard,’ Dr Hands added, before referencing two characters from the Victorian novels of Charles Dickens.

‘The underlying historic realisation was that children are special. And, because of this, they should be loved – not threatened by violence by the likes of Mr Squeers or filled with facts by the likes of Mr Gradgrind.

‘This background is important. For if it was the 19th century that invented this understanding of the child, it is the 21st that bids fair to hold its funeral. The chief mission and pride of our schools, historically and at the present, is to keep that concept of the child alive and cherished.’

In a challenge to Government control, he added: ‘Children and childhood are too precious to be abandoned to the anonymous and impersonal guardianship of the State. The State is not currently suitable to direct education unaided or unchallenged because it does not understand the child.’

Private schools risk haemorrhaging ‘huge numbers of pupils’ because fees are becoming unaffordable, a leading head teacher said. The warning came from Alex McGrath, head of King’s Ely Senior School in Cambridgeshire, who added: ‘This will lead to a more widespread view in our society that we are bastions of privilege.’

Annual day-only fees are just over £12,000 a year. Boarding schools typically charge £27,600 per pupil.
