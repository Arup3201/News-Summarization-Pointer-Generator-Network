Mother-of-five Mina Robinson woke up to find that someone had stabbed her in the side

A mother-of-five has told how an intruder broke into her home and plunged a knife into her side as she slept on the sofa.

Mina Robinson, 34, was sleeping in her living room after a full day decorating while her children stayed at her ex-husband's house.

She woke up bleeding heavily after an armed raider broke into her home at 10.40pm on February 3 this year and stabbed her with a knife, leaving the blade in her stomach.

The care assistant tried to stop her attacker who fled her home in Tamworth, Staffordshire, empty handed but collapsed in agonising pain.

She managed to dial 999 and was rushed to Walsgrave University Hospital in Coventry where doctors told her the tip of the knife was close to puncturing her intestine. 

Ms Robinson underwent four hours of surgery in the early hours of February 4 and remained in intensive care for four days before she recovered.

She described, for the first time, the moment she woke to find the knife plunged into her side.

'I was painting my house and fell asleep on the sofa as I was exhausted.' she said. 'Suddenly I heard someone rush past me and then I felt a sharp pain in my side.

'I caught a glimpse of someone running out of my house. Then I looked at my side and I had a knife sticking in me.

'I feel like I went into shock. When I did get to my phone I pressed the first button which was my cousin.

The intruder ran from her house after stabbing her. Ms Robinson now cannot return to her home and is staying with friends and family

'She couldn't understand me but then I dialled 999 and they said leave the knife there and that help was on its way.

'Police and paramedics turned up and they took me to hospital. They left the knife in because it was acting as a plug to stop the blood. I just remember being in and out of it.'

Ms Robinson was given 25 stitches but her wound has since burst - meaning she needed to have the gash repaired with Steristrips because she didn't have enough new tissue.

She was told by doctors that she was millimeters from death.

She said: 'After the surgery doctors said if it
had gone in a little bit further it would have gone into my intestine 
and I wouldn't have survived.

'It was literally millimetres from going in my intestine. They said all it needed was a little tap and it would've killed me.'

The mother was left so traumatised by the attack that she has refused to sleep in the house and is now staying with a friend in Wednesbury, West Midlands.

She added: 'I re-live it every day. It has been four weeks but it's always there in my mind. 

'It really isn't something you expect to happen in your own home. It has had a negative impact on my children and I am scared to be in my own home now.

"I haven't stayed in the house since it happened. I've stayed with my ex-husband to see the children but going back to the house is very hard.

'On the day I came out of hospital I did go back to the house and it was really difficult.

'But I can't sleep there ever again. The council are getting me a move and I'm just waiting for a few bits of paperwork to go through.

'I have no idea who could have done it and the police are still investigating but so far have no leads.'

A spokesman for Staffordshire Police said: 'Officers attended and found the victim, a 34-year-old woman with a stomach wound and she was taken by ambulance to Walsgrave University Hospital of Coventry for treatment.

'She has since been discharged. The offender fled the scene before emergency services arrived.'
