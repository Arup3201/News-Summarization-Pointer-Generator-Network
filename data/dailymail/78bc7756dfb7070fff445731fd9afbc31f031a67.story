A mother-and-son team have become one of the driving forces behind what has been described as a 'rubber dolling craze' by manufacturing and selling full female body suits to men who choose to live as female dolls.

Adam Ramos and his mother currently cater to 400,000 transgender and cross-dressing people across the world.

Mr Ramos, from Florida, who oversees the making of dozens of silicone body suits a week, inherited the business from his father, who came up with the idea after watching a TV show called 'RealDoll'.

Robby has now found notoriety as his female fantasy alter ego, but it was not until he reached the age of 50 that he began dressing as a woman and fantasising about having a female body

Robby started wearing women's clothes in private, but started putting on the full body suit after discovering FemSkin. Robby can be seen dressing up into a full length female bodysuit (right) and wearing one of the suits (left)

The show featured life-size dolls that certain men enjoy romantic and sexual relationships with.

He then saw an online forum discussing 'RealDoll' and found there was a demand for men wanting similar lifelike doll suits.

Mr Ramos decided to seize the opportunity and FemSkin was born.

Each of the body suits, which cost up to $1,850, takes about four hours to complete and weighs roughly 12 pounds.

Adam Ramos, who says he takes great pride in making his work look realistic, also produces custom orders from people with burns or scars.

He refuses however to create masks, because he believes they will always look unrealistic.

Robby said: 'When I'm out many people think my breasts are real or implants and this is my real body'

The company featured on a British documentary called Secrets of the Living Dolls, earlier this year.

Unlike transgender people, ‘maskers’, or ‘rubber dollers’ as they’re also known, do not feel born in the wrong body. For them, dressing up as a member of the opposite sex is simply a way to have fun.

At the time the documentary was publicised, Adam Ramos' mother Barbie Ramos, the owner of FemSkin, said: ‘They’re not freaky people, they’re not weird, they’re just like you and me.

‘They’re just like what they call “vanilla people” - that’s you and me - except for at night or on special occasions, they like to put on a mask. Why not?’

One of the company's best customers is a 70-year-old retired estate agent who goes by the name of 'Sherry'.

The cross-dresser, who has two daughters, does not want to be identified but refers to himself as 'Robby'.

He
 has now found notoriety as his female fantasy alter ego, but it was not
 until he reached the age of 50 that he began dressing as a woman and 
fantasising about having a female body.

He started wearing women's clothes in private but then started putting on the full body suit after discovering FemSkin.

Robby said: 'When I'm out many people think my breasts are real or implants and this is my real body.

'Even "vanillas" will come up and say, "Wow, that's an amazing rack" and I will respond, "I can tell you where to order one."'

Robby said: 'I don't know why it started and I don't know why it continues, but I'm sure having a lot of fun'

He went on to say: 'My motivation for doing this is a mystery to everyone, including me.

'One day something just clicked on.

'I don't know why it started and I don't know why it continues, but I'm sure having a lot of fun.'
