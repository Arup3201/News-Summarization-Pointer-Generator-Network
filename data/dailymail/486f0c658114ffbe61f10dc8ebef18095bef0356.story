Who needs an expensive wedding photographer when the Pope is around to pose for a selfie?

This newlywed couple persuaded Pope Francis to have his picture taken with them on Wednesday during his weekly audience at the Vatican.

And no wonder they’re smiling - they’ve just received the ultimate blessing.

Smiles better: The Pope posed for a selfie with a pair of newlyweds on Wednesday during his weekly audience

The selfie - initially tweeted by Zenit reporter Edward Pentin - is not a first for the Pope, though.

He appeared in one for the first time last August with a group of teenagers.

Needless to say, the image quickly went viral on social media.

The youngsters were part of a group of 500 teenagers who’d travelled to the Vatican for a pilgrimage from the Diocese of Piacenza and Bobbio, 50 miles south of Milan.

Russell Crowe hasn’t been so lucky, though. He’s now been snubbed twice by the Pope.

The actor was hoping that the Pope would bless his latest film, Noah, during a VIP audience on Wednesday.

Global star: According to film company Paramount, the Vatican cancelled a meeting between with Crowe and the Pope, saying the actor's appearance would be too disruptive

But according to film company Paramount the Vatican cancelled, saying Crowe’s appearance would be too disruptive.

So Mr Crowe waited with the crowds in the hope that the Pope would have a brief chat with him anyway as he moved through the audience.

However, after initially looking jovial, his mood soured as police ushered him away.
