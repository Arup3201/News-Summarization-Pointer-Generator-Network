Lancashire  defended the drainage system at Old Trafford after play was abandoned on the second day of the fourth Test against India because of damp patches on the boundary.

England had reached 237 for six in reply to India’s 152 when play was halted at 2.15pm. Although most of the outfield was fit, play was called off at 5.45 to the boos of many fans who had patiently remained.

Former England captain Nasser Hussain said: ‘The one thing you probably want to get right at Old Trafford is the drainage. It’s a shame that one heavy shower has ended up with the whole day called off.’

The end of the day: England's batsmen troop off at 2.15pm, which proved to be the close of play for the day

Lancashire’s cricket director Mike Watkinson blamed the farce on fresh turf laid down in April. He said: ‘I did hear that comment, and it was maybe something said in the moment. From our point of view we’ve got a lot of things right.’

England icon Geoff Boycott tweeted: ‘It’s a shame that 1% of the pitch is stopping play, no matter what the match has to go on!’

Building a lead: Joe Root was impressive as England built a lead of 85 runs on day two
