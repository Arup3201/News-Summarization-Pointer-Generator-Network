It's the start of a $671 million space mission that will take almost two years to complete - but the results are expected to show how Mars, the planet most like earth in the solar system, lost all its water.

The latest in NASA's Mars probes, the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission - MAVEN - officially kicked off this morning as an unnamed Atlas 5 rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.

The first phase, which will take 10 months, is for MAVEN - a satellite tucked inside the rocket under protective layers - to reach the Mars orbit in space.

Once there, MAVEN will fire off its braking rocket and be launched into orbit around Mars, allowing it to dip down and get as close to the planet as 65 miles from the ground in order to gather air samples for analysis.

It will monitor Mars for one year.

But unlike previous Mars probes, MAVEN will not land.

Instead it will scan the remains of the dusty, thin atmosphere and watch in real-time how it is peeled away by killer solar radiation.

At its highest point, MAVEN will be about 3,728 miles from the surface of Mars, a vantage point for measuring how much and what types of radiation are sweeping past the planet from the sun and cosmic sources.

The point of the project is to determine how much of the atmosphere is being lost to space today and extrapolate back in time to figure out what was happening in Mars' past.

In the 49 years since NASA's Mariner 4 spacecraft flew by Mars for the first time, an increasingly more sophisticated series of orbiters, landers and rovers have amassed solid evidence that the fourth planet from the sun was once much more like Earth, with oceans, rivers, rain and snow.

'We see a lot of evidence for liquid water having flowed over the surface in ancient times,' said lead scientist Bruce Jakosky from the University of Colorado.

'We see river channels, features that look like there have been lakes inside of impact craters.

'We see minerals that form only in the presence of liquid water.

'All of these suggest that there has been water on the planet early in time and today of course we see a cold, dry, desert-like planet.'

Figuring out what happened to Mars' climate hinges on learning what happened to the planet's water and the once-thick atmosphere needed to keep Mars warm enough for surface water.

The information is also expected to help scientists home in on when in Mars' history it may have been most suitable for life to evolve.

NASA's ongoing Curiosity rover mission is scouting for potential habitats that could have supported microbial life.

'Water is a requirement for life and if we understand where the water has been and why it's not there anymore we can learn more about what the history of the potential for life has been,' Jakosky said.

There are two options for where the planet's missing water and atmosphere went: down into the ground or up into space.

Scientists know some of the planet's carbon dioxide ended up on the surface and joined with minerals in the crust.

Unique: Unlike previous Mars probes, MAVEN will not land on the barren planet, but take samples and analysis from above

But so far, the ground inventory is not large enough to account for the early, thick atmosphere Mars would have needed to support water on its surface.

MAVEN is designed to explore the other option, that the water and atmosphere were lost into space, a process that began about 4 billion years ago when the planet's protective magnetic field mysteriously turned off.

'The sun, the solar wind can drive processes that remove gas from the top of the atmosphere,' Jakosky said.

'We want to understand whether the sun was able to remove gas from the top of the atmosphere and how much.'

MAVEN is due to reach Mars on September 22, 2014 - two days before India's Mars Orbiter Mission, which launched on November 5.

India's probe has been raising its orbit around Earth and should be in position on December 1 to begin the journey to Mars.
