When he was born at 24 weeks, it was almost impossible for Finley Devonshire's parents to imagine the tiny addition to their family would survive.

But, despite weighing just 15ozs - less than a bag of sugar - he is now five months old and has finally been allowed to go home.

His mother, Gemma Haskey, has spoken about how she started suffering headaches and high blood pressure which doctors told her was pre-eclampsia.

Finley Devonshire has finally been allowed home five months after he was born weighing just 15ozs

Parents Gemma Haskey and Graham Devonshire were faced with the agonising option of whether to abort the pregnancy when she was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia

She was given the agonising option of aborting the pregnancy because the baby could be brain-damaged.

A scan showed that Finley was healthy and so she vowed to continue to carry him.

But
 just a day later Finley's father, Graham Devonshire, 40, got a call 
from the Nottingham City Hospital telling him Gemma's condition had 
deteriorated and they had no choice but to deliver the baby.

Doctors
 said Finley had only a ten per cent chance of surviving the Caesarean 
section. Incredibly, he responded well after being rushed to a neonatal 
intensive care unit for treatment.

Gemma was also rushed to intensive care after the birth and only saw her son for the first time four days later.

Gemma fell ill during the 23rd week of pregnancy and delivered Finley a day after being admitted to hospital

But
 on the same day mother and baby met for the first time Finley started 
bleeding on the lungs and was given just 24 hours to live.

Gemma
 said: 'I can't remember much of that first week. I just wanted to know 
he was okay and the nurses were great at giving me updates, but I don't 
think we really understood how poorly he was.

'They took us into a room and said he's got this big bleed on his lungs and he was very poorly.

'We
 said as long as he wants to fight we want to fight with him, so they 
gave him an aggressive form of ventilation and we just had to wait and 
see. We just stayed positive.

'My philosophy from day one was "whatever happens, happens" and that got me through.'

Finley responded to the ventilation and surprised medics by beating the bleed on his lungs.

After
 16 days he was transferred to the Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, 
where he was fitted with a Broviac line to supply nutrients.

It was a further 17 weeks before Finley - now five months - was finally allowed to go home with his parents on August 14.

Gemma said: 'It was the one question I never asked. We only found out a week before he came home that we could take him.

'It's the best feeling ever. From day one he had this amazing fighting spirit and I think he even amazed the doctors sometimes.

'I can't even put in to words what he's been through. There's a lot of adults that wouldn't be able to go through it.'

Gemma can barely remember the first week of Finley's life and she did not get to see her son until he was four days old

Graham and Gemma, from Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, were told last year they could have children again following Gemma's major transplant surgery.

Graham urged other families with premature babies not to give up hope.

He said: 'We didn't dare allow ourselves to think past the next hour and just took everything day by day, even hour by hour to begin with.'

'What he was going through, the treatments, he was being given the highest intensive care they could give, so he was very sick and we just had to hope.

'It's always at the back of your mind that something would happen but you just have to keep going.

'For any other family going through this - don't give up. We didn't and if Finley can get through it, there's always hope.'

The couple were told Finley will probably suffer from sight problems in the long-term but it is too early to say if there will be any other health complications.

Doctors yesterday hailed Finley as a miracle and said he had defied the odds to make it.

Consultant, Bernard Schoonakker, said: 'He's one of the smallest babies we've looked after.

'The fact his mother was so unwell, how early he was born - he really is a little miracle for us.'
