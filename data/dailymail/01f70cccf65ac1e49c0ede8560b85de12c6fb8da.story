Edward Snowden has been pictured in public today for the first time since leaving Moscow airport.

The National Security Agency whisteblower emerged to collect the Sam Adams Associates Integrity in Intelligence Award.

The picture was published on the same day his father Lon Snowden arrived in Russia to see his son.

Lon Snowden told reporters in Moscow he was 'not sure' if Edward Snowden would ever return to the U.S.

Dressed in a black suit and 
open-necked blue shirt, Snowden was seen smiling alongside UK WikiLeaks 
journalist Sarah Harrison, who took the leaker from Hong Kong to Moscow 
and also obtained his asylum.

The precise location of the award ceremony is not known, although it is believed to have been in Moscow.

The award is given annually for people operating within the intelligence community who stand up to abuse of information gathering.

Previous winners include Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and former British Intelligence translator Katharine Gun who leaked information suggesting America acted illegally in pushing for the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

Four former U.S. government officials who met Snowden said today he is adjusting to life in Russia and shows no sign of regrets about leaking highly classified information.

The Americans, who once worked for the CIA, FBI, Justice Department and NSA, have criticized the U.S. government and in some cases exposed what they believed was wrongdoing in the its security agencies.

They are the first Americans known to have met with Snowden, 30, since he was granted asylum in Russia in August.

Thomas Drake, a former NSA executive who
 gave inside information to a newspaper about an electronic espionage 
program that he saw as invasive, said: 'He spoke about going out and about and getting to understand Russia and its culture and the people.

'This is where he lives now, and so where you live is your home.'

The four former U.S. officials refused to say where they met with Snowden or where he is living.

'For his own safety it's best that no one else knows where he actually lives,' Drake said.

'But I believe he is making the best of his circumstances and is living as normally as possible.'

Drake and the other Americans - Raymond McGovern, Jesselyn Radack and Coleen Rowley - said Snowden was in good spirits and still believes he did the right thing in disclosing the NSA surveillance program.

They said they saw no evidence that Snowden was under the control of Russian security services, as many in the U.S. government believe.

'He spoke very openly about a whole range of things, a number of which I won't get into here, but it certainly didn't involve any kind of manipulation by the Russian government or anyone else for that matter,' said Radack, a former Justice Department adviser now with the Government Accountability Project.

'He definitely is his own person and makes his own decisions and says and does what he wants to.'

Earlier today, Lon Snowden told 
Russian television crews outside the airport this morning that he doubts
 his son will return to the U.S.

He is currently living in a secret location after he was charged with violating the Espionage Act for 
disclosing NSA's highly classified surveillance of phone and Internet 
usage around the world.

NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden was given temporary asylum by President Putin

'I'm not sure that my son will be returning to the U.S. again,' Lon Snowden said but added that 'that's his decision.'

He added: 'He's safe and he's free, and that's a good thing.'

Lon Snowden also said he has not had direct contact with his son and would not say when or where he will be meeting him.

He added: 'I am his father, I love my son and... I certainly hope I will have an opportunity to see my son.'

Edward Snowden was stuck at a Moscow airport for more than a month after his arrival from Hong Kong on June 23.

He was granted temporary asylum in Russia in August and his whereabouts remain secret although his lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, insists that Snowden lives in Russia.

Lon Snowden said that it is his 
understanding that his son has now stopped leaking information, which 
was a condition of his prolonged stay in Russia. 

He thanked Russia and President Vladimir Putin for sheltering his son.

Edward Snowden's asylum status has strained the already tense relationship between the U.S. and Russia.

In September, President Barack Obama called off a meeting with President Putin at a Russia-hosted summit.

The
 decision to publish the leaked information in The Guardian newspaper 
has also provoked criticism from Prime Minister David Cameron and MI5 
director-general Andrew Parker, who has warned the leaks are a ‘gift’ to
 terrorists.
