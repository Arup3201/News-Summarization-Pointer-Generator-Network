A terminally ill seven-year-old girl has returned home to die following specialist treatment in Mexico.

Olivia Downie and her family, from Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, flew to the North American country earlier this month to get treatment for neuroblastoma, an aggressive form of cancer.

While there, Olivia fell seriously ill and her family was told she would need expensive medical treatment on any flight home.

Peaceful: Olivia died in the early hours of Friday morning

Olivia, her mother Lauren and father Steven touched down in Aberdeen on a medical plane this lunchtime.

A
 charity, Families Against Neuroblastoma, has been helping the family 
and set a target of £110,000 to fund their journey back to Scotland.

Only last week, Mrs Downie said: 'We want her to be surrounded by friends and family that love her, not strangers.

A
 JustGiving page set up to raise money for her flight and medical costs 
now shows over £150,000 has been donated. Olivia will go straight to 
hospital.

A spokesman for 
Air Ambulance Worldwide, which transferred Olivia, said: 'The flight has
 landed. Our indications are that the flight went well. All the reports 
were that she was doing fine.'

At
 the weekend, online problems with NatWest bank delayed pledged funds 
from appearing in the charity’s account, although FAN said the bank 
worked all day to resolve the issue.

The medical bill for the hospital in Mexico has now been settled.

FAN
 said on its Facebook page: 'Once again, thank you to everyone who has 
made Olivia’s trip home a reality, we couldn’t have done it without the 
generosity and spirit of the public.

There had been fears that doctors in Mexico would turn Olivia's life support machine off if funding had not been raised

'Lauren and Steven are overwhelmed by the public support, as are we.

'Now
 is the time for Olivia and her family to all be together and they 
appreciate that the public will want them to have this time alone and in
 particular without media intrusion.

'Thank
 you again from Olivia and all her family and Families Against 
Neuroblastoma, we hope we will have gained some new friends and support 
along the way. Thankyou.'

Olivia was diagnosed in January 2009 after suffering from severe backache and tiredness.

Following visits to GPs she was taken to Royal Aberdeen Children’s Hospital and diagnosed with neuroblastoma.

At one point father Steven and mother Lauren, who is heavily pregnant, were told that the hospital had not received the money due to a NatWest glitch

FAN said Olivia has a tumour the size of a grapefruit in her stomach.

Speaking
 on north-east Scotland radio station Original 106 at the weekend, her 
mother Lauren said: 'We’re terrified to lose her because at the very 
least we want to have her comfortable at home and surrounded by familiar
 faces.

'If we were to lose her here then had to fly her body home we would be tortured forever more and it would be the end of us.

'There’s no way we would be able to live with ourselves.'

Neuroblastoma is a cancer of the nervous system and can occur anywhere in the body.

Fewer than 100 children are diagnosed with it each year in the UK and most who suffer from it are younger than five-years-old.
