The festive period has been an enjoyable time for Chelsea after they ended the year top of the Premier League, but for one player there was cause for celebration for an entirely different reason.

Midfielder Cesc Fabregas took to social media to express his delight at the news he would become a father for a second time, and posted a picture online of an ultrasound depicting the outline of baby girl.  

He said: 'Another princess on the way...!! Well done my baby.'

The club also tweeted about the revelation, saying: 'Congratulations @cesc4official on your fantastic family news.' 

The former Barcelona and Arsenal man already has a daughter, Lia, born in 2013, with long-term partner Daniella Semaan - although she has two other children from a previous partner.

Fabregas has excelled since returning to the Premier League in a £27million summer deal, scoring twice and providing 14 assists for new club Chelsea.

The 27-year-old has also scored twice and provided three assists for Jose Mourinho's men in the Champions League.

With the possibility of picking up his first ever Premier League medal, 2015 is promising to be a memorable year for Fabregas.
