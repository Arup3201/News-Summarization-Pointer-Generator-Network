After 60 years of marriage, nothing could rattle a pair of octogenarians – not even a car crash.

So when the couple emerged unscathed from the rollover in Bel Air, California, they did the only logical thing, grabbing their cell phones to pose for selifes with the wreckage.

The incident took place late Friday afternoon on Linda Flora Drive in the wealthy Los Angeles neighborhood made famous in the 90s by a sitcom starring Will Smith.

The married couple were driving their electric-blue Honda sedan with California license plates when the vehicle flipped over, landing on its left side on a tree-lined street.

No one was injured, but the female driver found herself trapped inside while her husband was able to climb out of the passenger’s seat.

As they waited for help to arrive, the husband sporting a pair of grey trousers hiked up to his chest happily posed for photos outside the overturned car with his wife still stranded inside.

As neighbors and passersby rushed to lend the couple a hand, the elderly woman in the car asked her husband for her purse so that she too could snap a selfie with her phone.

Rescuers: Officials from the LA Fire Department eventually extracted the wife from the flipped over car

Eyewitness Ryan Steinberg, who happened to be in the area, also posed for a photo depicting him with a wide grin against the backdrop of the blue Honda perched on its side. 

The Los Angeles Fire Department eventually arrived on the scene and extracted the driver from the overturned vehicle.

Both husband and wife were said to be in good spirits. Their names have not been released to the public.
