Bullied: Amanda Cummings was picked on at school, according to her family

Teenager Amanda Cummings who killed herself after being 'tormented by bullies' is still being mocked in death.

Abusive message have been posted on her memorial Facebook page even as her family and friends attended her funeral yesterday in Staten Island, New York.

The page contains obscene and mocking images, videos and comments with some of them making fun of her for fatally jumping in front of a bus.

A message from Stephen Ephrem Green said: 'Bus was cummin’ Bitch was watchin’ Oh hurry Amanda Your bus cummin.'

But most of the postings were sympathetic with one writing: 'I hope all of you posting the bus pictures are having fun because I will sit here all day if I have to and report every single one of you!'

Another wrote "People are sick, ignoring them removes all power from them. Keep your head up and let time heal this horrible wound. RIP.'

Amanda, 15, died earlier this week - six days after she was hit by the bus as she clutched a suicide note.

Family members 
say it was years of bullying at school that led to her death.

Her uncle told NBC New York that classmates allegedly mocked her, took her phone, shoes and her jacket. He claimed one of her tormentors pulled a knife on her.

Scores of mourners packed St Ann's Church on Cromwell Avenue, to say an emotional farewell to the tragic pupil of New Dorp High School.

'I just want all the talking on Facebook to end, I want everything, all the cyber bullying to stop,' mourner Joey Demato told the New York Post after the service.

Demato, a classmate of Amanda's, spoke during the service, remembering her as smart, funny and full of promise.

He said: 'We all loved Amanda -- she had an amazing personality. She was always the life of the party, from her laugh, to her intelligent humorous perspective on life. She was a blessing to us all.

'She was always there to comfort, always there to talk, always having fun. She helped most of us, hopefully all of us, get through the day, not even realizing she was helping us to do so.'

The Reverend Joy Mampilly told the mourners: 'The peace and happiness that seemed to have eluded Amanda in her life, she’ll have in full in the presence of the lord.'

Amanda's anguished mother Cecile Weber 
and Amanda's older sister Dawn Weber didn’t speak at the service, but  followed her 
casket out of the church after the funeral mass, laying pink and white 
roses on top.

On
Facebook, Ms Weber had posted a stinging message to those she blames for her daughter's death.

'This is to all you 
evil son of a b*tches that picked on, talked about and threatened my 
baby.

'I HOPE YOU DIE and I HOPE YOU SUFFER.'

Dawn also went on the social networking site to plead for anyone with information to come forward.

She wrote: 'As a sister, a mother and a human being with a beating heart that is broken I am begging you kids, anyone with any concrete proof of bullying towards my sister please let me know.

'Please I need witnesses willing to step forward to make legal statements. Not just kids coming out of the woodwork that want to gossip thank you.'

On December 27 at about 7:30pm, witnesses saw Amanda jump in front of an oncoming city bus. Hours before, she had posted to Facebook: '... Nd ill die tomight crying over you..'

Her death came weeks after revealing 
posts appeared on her public Facebook page, in which she talked about 
'feeling depressed' and asks 'what did I do to deserve this?'

In one disturbing post on December 1 she said: 'I'll go kill myself'.

On
December 6, in what appears to be a cry for help, Amanda posted on her 
Facebook: 'When i say im ok i want that one person t look me in the eye,
hug me & say no ur not'

Three
days earlier, the natural blonde who recently dyed her hair black, 
said: 'Worst sat nite ever i cnt believe this is happening what did i do
to deserve this.'

She later talks about; 'mad people are turning against me :'( im spending this sat nite alone in my room crying'

Her
mother, said this week that she would donate her daughter's organs  to 
save the life of another. 

Her daughter was to be cremated after the funeral.
