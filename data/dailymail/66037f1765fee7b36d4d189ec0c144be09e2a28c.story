This news comes one day after it was revealed a man was arrested in Cuba after attempting to board a flight to America with 66 rare birds sewn inside his trousers.

The bird man was seized at Ignacio Agramonte International Airport in the Cuban city of Camaguay and was picked up because of the curious bulges in his trousers.

After being stopped by customs, the man bizarrely claimed he was only concealing a pigeon as a gift for his grandson.
