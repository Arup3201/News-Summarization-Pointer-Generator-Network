A 55-year-old Canadian man died after a violent struggle with a male deer that attacked and killed him with its antlers and hooves, police said.

Donald Dube was killed on Sunday evening as he tried to feed his herd of domesticated deer near his home in Saint-Leonard, New Brunswick.

The attack was so violent that the father-of-three had piercings to his skin and was missing a boot and sock when found, investigators said.

A buck may have pinned Mr Dube to the 
ground and put its weight on him. It is believed one turned on him 
while he was feeding them.

His wife, Mona Dube, raised the alarm after he did not return home after going out to feed the animals, reported the Canadian Press.

Police later found his body in a pen near the home. Police Sergeant Marc Violette said bucks try to mate with does around this time of year.

‘The animal probably stomped on him and used his antlers to rough him up and throw him around like a rag doll,’ he told the Canadian Press.

‘Adult male deer this time of year 
have significant antlers and in the wild they are very adept at using 
them to fend off predators.’

Mr Dube’s home is located on the Route 17 road between Saint Leonard and Saint Quentin, near the border with the U.S.

He kept deer on his property as a hobby, 
reported the Telegraph-Journal. Sgt Violette said he had never seen
such an incident in 25 years of work.

The Dube family and department of natural
resources biologists will decide what happens to the deer, reported the
Telegraph-Journal.

Around 100 of Mrs Dube’s friends have already taken to her Facebook wall to post messages of condolence at her loss.

'My deepest sympathies,' wrote Tammy Boutot Rossignol. 'Donald will be missed by all, he was a great man with a big heart.'

Sonia St-amand posted: 'Your husband was a great man who always made everyone around him laugh - he will be missed dearly.'
