Novak Djokovic admits he does not know how impending fatherhood will impact on his performance at the US Open.

The world number one and new wife Jelena are expecting their first child in October.

They married in Montenegro a few days after Djokovic defeated Roger Federer to win Wimbledon, and initial indications suggest the Serbian will struggle to play his best tennis.

He was a shadow of the player that won his seventh grand slam title on Centre Court last month as he suffered early defeats in the Masters tournaments in Toronto and Cincinnati.

Djokovic has been seeking advice from coach Boris Becker about how to cope with the competing responsibilities in his life as he prepares to begin his Flushing Meadows campaign against Argentina's Diego Schwartzman.

The 27-year-old said: 'A lot of things happened in the last two months, and it was a very emotional period. I just felt a bit flat on the court. I wasn't managing to find that intensity and the perfect mindset.

'But it's all normal. It's something that I'm experiencing for the first time. So I'm trying to talk as much as I can to first of all my coach that has been through similar experiences in his life more than one time. I'm trying to get as much information as I can.

'I have only positive and joyful feelings (about) approaching fatherhood, and hopefully it's going to happen in less than two months. Then I'm going to enjoy it and try to take as much energy as I can, positive energy to the tennis court.

'But without a doubt, life changes. Priorities change. My priorities are my family, my wife, my future kid. Tennis is definitely not number one any more.'

Djokovic has reached the US Open final in each of the last four years, beating Rafael Nadal in 2011 but losing to the Spaniard last year and in 2010, and also to Andy Murray two years ago.

With Nadal missing as he nurses a wrist injury, Djokovic goes into the tournament as favourite, and his expectations remain high.

He said: 'I'm feeling better and better as the days go by. It's something that is encouraging me for this year's US Open campaign.

'Obviously I want to peak with my form at the US Open. Yes, I wanted to do better in Canada and Cincinnati. Unfortunately I wasn't even close to my best.

'I have high expectations for myself. I always have. Especially at this stage of my career where I feel like now is the time that I'm at my peak physical strength. I want to use this time of my career as much as I can to win as many matches as possible.

'Obviously I know I'm not the only one that has this kind of optimistic mindset. There are many players who are fighting for the same trophy. This is the last Grand Slam of the year, and this is where you want to play your best.'

The absence of Nadal coupled with doubts over the form of Djokovic and Murray makes this potentially the most open grand slam in years, although Federer is in ominous form.

Grigor Dimitrov and Milos Raonic are leading the next generation's push to break into the grand slam winners' circle, and both will fancy their chances here.

'When Rafa is not around it changes because he always has been a favourite in every grand slam for the last seven, eight, 10 years,' said Djokovic. 'Definitely the tournament and tennis is losing when they don't have Rafa in the tournament.

'I know that there is one thing for sure: everybody is starting from scratch. Everybody starts from Monday.'
