Heathrow Airport's new Terminal 2 is set to open in months, giving the capital a spacious new air transit point able to handle 20million passengers a year.

Replacing the old, overcrowded Terminal 2 which had stood since the Fifties, the new facility was today hailed as a cornerstone of Heathrow's revitalisation ahead of its opening on June 4.

Shafts of natural light and high quality acoustics should make the building a calm space for travellers accustomed to high anxiety at dark, noisy airports, said lead architect Luis Vidal.

'If you make it intuitive, pleasant, joyful, you can take away a completely different memory of the terminal,' Mr Vidal told The Associated Press.

'You can never completely erase your memory of the former Terminal 2, because it was a dreadful experience. This will be completely the opposite. This will be a destination. People will want to come here.'

In an effort to dispense with those past bad associations, the new Terminal 2 will be rebranded as 'The Queen's Terminal'. Queen Elizabeth will open the building herself - just as she did the original Terminal 2 in 1955.

The completion of the £2.5billion project, in conjunction with the relatively new Terminal 5 that opened in 2008, gives Heathrow two modern terminals. It is part of an £11billion refurbishment designed to keep London's biggest airport competitive with other major European hubs including Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Paris.

The Queen's Terminal will host 26 airlines, including United, Air Canada, Singapore Airlines and others that are part of the global Star Alliance, and offer flights to 51 destinations.

Of course, with London increasingly becoming a destination of choice for the world's super-rich, Terminal 2 will have no shortage of pricey shops.

Officials say Terminal 2 will be the first in the world to offer a 'complimentary personal shopping lounge where trained stylists will present a curated range of products for each client.'

The interior of the new terminal is dominated by a huge aluminium sculpture hanging 18m above the ground that is inspired by the flight path of a stunt place.

British artist Richard Wilson's 'Slipstream' weighs 77 tonnes and is 78m in length, its vast bulk looming above the terminal's main lobby and escalators, evoking the journeys that those who see it are set to embark on.

Chastened by the problems that plagued the opening of Terminal 5, which included chaos when the luggage handling system broke down, airport officials are planning a 'soft' opening of the new terminal.

Only one flight is planned the first day so, even if things go awry, the number of people affected will be small.

The new terminal will gradually be brought to full capacity over six months.

Heathrow officials say they are still pushing to build a controversial third runway, which is opposed by London Mayor Boris Johnson and influential environmental groups.

John Holland-Kaye, Heathrow's development director, said the completion of the new terminal shows Heathrow has complied with the last Labour government's directive that Heathrow should improve without growing.

'Our challenge now is to make the case to expand,' he said, admitting that getting permission would be 'politically complex.'

Mr Holland-Kaye said private money is available to pay for a third runway, which would greatly add to Heathrow's capacity.

He also claimed the new Terminal 2 would reduce the 'stacking' problem over Heathrow that often causes delays as planes await permission to land.
