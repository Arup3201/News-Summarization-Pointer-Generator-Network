Australian singer Rob Mills has been accused of being homophobic on social media after posting an indecent photo of two Lego figurines on Instagram.

The former Australian Idol contestant, who is vocal about supporting gay marriage, celebrated the Hawk's AFL Grand Final win over the Swans when he posted two figurines in a sexual position.

The photo, which has since been removed, shows a Hawthorn Hawks Lego figurine bending-over a Sydney Swans figure with hashtags #hilarious #criticssaidwhaaaaaat #b2b and #alwayshawthorn. 

Mills, who recently starred as Danny in the Grease Musical, released an official statement on Sunday night, saying the photo was 'immature and inappropriate.'

Mills has since received a social media backlash for the image (above/cropped) he posted on Instagram

'I apologise unreservedly for the photo I tweeted yesterday', Mills said in the statement.

'In the excitement of celebrating the Hawks Grand Final win, I didn’t think about the homophobic implications of the image.

'This incident probably shows how entrenched inadvertent homophobia is in our culture.

'As a long-time supporter of the rights of Australia’s gay community, it’s not good enough and I’m ashamed if I have contributed to it, even in a small way.'

The singer has vocal in supporting of gay marriage, calling it 'a no-brainer', and saying 'I can't believe that in Australia we still don't allow same-sex couples to get married.

But  the singer has now been slammed for demonising homosexuality.

Bec Barrett tweeted: 'Shame on you @RobMillsyMills for instagramming that vile, homophobic lego picture about the Swans v Hawthorn. I thought better of you.'

Erin Riley tweeted: 'It equates receiving anal sex with being beaten or losing - that is homophobic,'

Ms Riley, a 20 year old Sydney resident, told Sydney Morning Herald that a large group of Hawthorn fans had been chanting during the match, 'Sydney take it up the a---, doo-dah, doo-dah'.

Alex Dunnin tweeted: 'Another celeb social media fail. What a goose.'

But others came to Mills' defence, such as Enda Markey, who tweeted:

'For the sake of saying it: Calling @RobMillsyMills homophobic is ludicrous. He's not.‏'

James Millar tweeted: 'Accusing @RobMillsyMills of being homophobic is as legitimate and accurate as accusing me of being a heterosexual football fan. #HesNOT.' 

Mills currently plays Danny Zuko in an internationally toured musical production of Grease.
