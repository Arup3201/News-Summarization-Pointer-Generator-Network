They might look like two adults playing at being astronauts while doing their weekly shop, but in fact, the two men behind the masks have a deadly allergy to the sun.

Thomas and Vincent Seris, who live in Bordeaux, France, suffer from Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP), cannot be exposed to the sun and its ultraviolet (UV) light. 

If they are, the twins are likely to develop a 'precocious' and potentially fatal skin cancers.

In some cases, just a glimpse of sunlight is all it takes for the cancer to develop. 

Genetic: Thomas and Vincent (pushing the trolley) suffer from a condition called Xeroderma Pigmentosum, or XP

Fatal: The genetic condition means their skin is very sensitive to sunlight, and even being exposed to a small amount can cause skin cancer 

Advances: The twins have been testing new masks, designed to protect them from UV rays, for the last year

In an effort to be allowed to live a normal life, the twins, who have been dubbed The Children of the Moon by the French media, have be testing out a new protective mask.

The mask is transparent and ventilated, and has been developed by several hospitals in France. 

Four years ago it was a different story.

The boys had to wear  a ski mask every time they left home, as well as coveralls and white gloves manufactured by NASA.

The boys, then 17, knew it was a scary look: so much so, they allowed their lives to be the inspiration for French film La Permission de Minuit.

'I would love to stop scaring people,' Vincent said at the time it was released. '[I hope it] will allow people to take another look at the children suffering in France.'

Normal: The boys have managed to live a relatively normal life, now attending the University of Bordeaux

Precautions: Vincent uses a device to check for ultra violet light before leaving the building in Bordeaux

Danger: Even lightbulbs can be dangerous for the twins - which means they have to keep the suits on while shopping

Image: Vincent has previously said he would like people not to be scared of his appearance anymore

Vincent and Thomas are two of just 70 or 80 people living with the genetic condition in France.

In the entire world, it is thought there are only somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 such cases. 

They were diagnosed with XP aged just two and, within four months Vincent had had three bouts of skin cancer. 

Their worried parents Françoise and Bernard found ways of keeping their sons safe - including putting UV filters over the windows of their home.

They also set up the charity Les Enfants de la Lune in 2000, hoping to bring together people with the genetic conditions and put pressure on medical researchers to find out more about XP.

Rare: The twins - seen here in their apartment - are two of just 70 or 80 people who have the condition in France

Unusual: Worldwide, it is thought only between five and 6,000 people suffer from XP

Education: Thomas (left) and Vincent talk to a student at the University of Bordeaux

However, it seems Vincent and Thomas managed to live a relatively ordinary life.

Growing up, they attended school, and went to the cinema and bowling with friends, and on weekends and during the holiday, they went swimming a skiing.

They also developed one hobby which was particularly well-suited to their condition: caving.

And nowadays they are students at the University of Bordeaux - which made adjustments to the buildings to allow them to attend.

Vincent and Thomas Seris, of Bordeaux, have a rare genetic condition, XP

Exposure to the sun can be fatal - so they have to keep covered up

For the last year, the twins have been trialing new protective masks

But the university students have managed to live relatively normal lives
