A furious row erupted between the UK and Turkey as it emerged three runaway British teenage girls have reached Syria.

Scotland Yard confirmed yesterday that the schoolgirls had crossed the Turkish border into Islamic State territory after flying to Istanbul via Gatwick Airport.

Police fear the trio - named as Kadiza Sultana, 16, Amira Abase, 15, and Shamima Begum, 15 - are aiming to reach the terror stronghold of Raqqa where they face being married off to foreign fighters.

Flight to terror: Clutching their luggage, the three teenage friends prepare to board a flight to Istanbul last week. Police believe they have now been smuggled into Syria 

Smugglers in the Turkish border town of Akcakale said they had already crossed the chaotic border using false Syrian IDs and accompanied by a man claiming to be their father. 

One said: ‘They looked like Syrian girls, they were wearing hijabs and carrying bags from the market. They followed a man who spoke Arabic so everyone thought they were Syrian.' 

But a row broke out between the UK and Turkey, as the Turkish authorities claimed Scotland Yard had waited three days to tell them about the runaways.

In an outspoken attack, Turkey’s deputy prime minister Bulent Arinc pinned the blame on UK police and accused them of allowing the girls to flee Britain.

‘It is a reprehensible act for Britain, a country famous for its Scotland Yard, to let the three girls...leave (London) for Istanbul and then let us know three days later,’ he said. 

‘They haven’t taken the necessary measures. The search is ongoing. It would be great if we can find them. But if we can’t, it is not us who will be responsible, but the British.’

Mr Arinc said the girls had posed as tourists so there was no way of knowing their intentions.

But Scotland Yard hit back, saying that its officers began working with Turkish authorities the day after the first two teenagers were reported missing last Tuesday.

A spokesman said: ‘Once we established that the girls had travelled to Turkey, police made contact with the foreign liaison officer at the Turkish Embassy in London on Wednesday, 18 February. 

'Since then we have been working closely with the Turkish authorities who are providing great assistance and support to our investigation.’

Scotland Yard confirmed that the girls were now in Syria. 

In a statement, the force said: ‘Officers from the MPS counter-terrorism command, leading the investigation into the three missing schoolgirls from east London, now have reason to believe that they are no longer in Turkey and have crossed into Syria.

Turkey has repeatedly been accused by its Western allies of failing to do enough to stop jihadis on their way to Syria.

Mr Arinc’s complaints echo remarks made by Turkish officials after Hayat Boumeddiene, the wanted partner of one of the gunmen behind the January terror attacks in France, travelled undetected through Turkey on her way to Syria.

Security officials say 3,400 foreign fighters, including at least 500 Britons, have travelled from Europe to Syria to fight, often via Turkey. Experts estimate about 50 are women.

The trio, who all attended Bethnal Green Academy in east London, were described as 'straight-A students'.

It was revealed last week that the three were interviewed by police just two months ago, amid fears they were being radicalised.

Detectives spoke to the teens after one of their classmates left for the war zone as they believed they were being encouraged to leave their homes. 

The schoolgirls are feared to have fled to Syria to become jihadi brides after being ruthlessly groomed online and 'brainwashed in their bedrooms'.

They walked out of their homes last Tuesday before strolling through security checks at Gatwick Airport and flying to Turkey.

Police said their families, who have issued urgent appeals for their daughters to return, have been surprised and devastated by their disappearance. 

The news comes after Prime Minister David Cameron urged airlines and internet companies to do more to prevent radicalised British teenagers travelling to the Middle East.

Earlier, the girls' headteacher said he was 'shocked and saddened' by their disappearance, but said police had not found evidence that they were radicalised at school.

Mark Keary, principal of Bethnal Green Academy in east London, said police spoke to the girls after another student disappeared in December and indicated at the time that there was no evidence that they were at risk of being radicalised or absconding.

He also said access to social media at the school was 'strictly regulated'.

A tweet sent from a Twitter account under Shamima's name was sent to Aqsa Mahmood, who left Glasgow for Syria to be a 'jihadi bride' in 2013.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'We work very closely with the Turkish authorities on a whole series of security measures. We are going to continue to do so.

'It is a good, strong, constructive relationship. We are working with them on this case.

'We are going to keep working very closely with the Turkish authorities on what is a shared challenge.'
