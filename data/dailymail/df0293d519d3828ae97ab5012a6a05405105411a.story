And so at lunchtime on Monday comes what could be the last formality in the life of Andy Murray, reigning Wimbledon champion - opening up the Centre Court programme at the allotted time at 1pm.

Save for the traditional set played on Saturday between four lady members it will be a pristine new grass court, reserved for last year’s winner and free of the dusty ruts that will develop between now and a week on Sunday.

Come July 6 there is, genuinely, the chance that Murray will be holding the trophy aloft again and taking us back to that extraordinary afternoon 50 weeks ago, the memory of which even now has a surreal tinge.

Up for the challenge: Andy Murray returns to Wimbledon this year looking to defend his title

One huge change will be the composition this year of his player box, with the vastly contrasting figure of Amelie Mauresemo replacing Mr. Inscrutable himself, Ivan Lendl, who today will be at his Conneticut home playing golf.

This fascinating alteration of personnel apart, in most ways Murray’s reign as champion has been more notable for what has not happened during it rather than what actually did.

The 27 year-old Scot did not sweep all before him on the court, he did not multiply his personal fortune many times, his victory has not led to a wider upturn in British tennis fortunes, he has not changed discernibly as a person.

He did not even go out and treat himself to something special as a reward for achieving his life’s dream, although he did buy and renovate a hotel near his hometown of Dunblane.

Last time a British man successfully defended a Grand Slam. Fred Perry won Wimbledon from 1934 to 1936. He also won the US Open in 1933 and 1934.

Murray himself is pleased, even relieved, that this is the case. It may have been the most unexpected bonus that came with ending Britain’s 77-year drought in terms of a male champion.

'Nothing has changed. Maybe abroad I get recognised more than I used to but in terms of what I do on a day-to-day basis, nothing is different,' he says.

'For me, that has probably been the nicest part about it because that was something I was worried about. I had spoken to psychologists before and told them that was something that concerned me. I spoke to Ivan about it.

'What is nice is coming back and seeing your name on the wall because there's great history attached to the tournament. Most of the greatest players who have ever played have won here -  it’s something no-one can take away from you.

The wait is over: Andy Murray became the first British man for 77 years to win the Wimbledon title in 2013

'Nowadays it is a place I like going to because it is quiet. I like to go to Wimbledon to practise sometimes, or just to be there. It is quiet. It is a place where I can go and I don’t get bothered. I can think here.'

Murray’s kit from the final now sits on show in the Club’s museum, although he has never been to inspect it, while the trophy is in a room at home he rarely enters. You sense that he does not want to allow himself too much reflection until retirement, partly due to the admission that winning sapped his determination for several months afterwards.

'It was different, not having motivation, that’s not a nice feeling because I’m used to being extremely motivated, so there are parts that made me happy and there were some things like struggling to get up for practices and training - that wasn’t that nice. When I decided to have surgery (in late September), that was when I moved on.'

The existential feelings after Wimbledon and three-month hiatus caused by surgery are clearly major factors in why he has not even reached a final since Wimbledon last year.

The reluctance to put himself out for the corporate world and a lack of enthusiasm for material gain are among the factors why he has barely cashed in on last year’s triumph (although he has still chosen to chase beefed up appearance fees on occasion.)

In fact, until signing a patch deal last week with Standard Life he was looking the most undersponsored superstar of any sport. Asked if this has cost him much money he sheepishly nods.

'There have been quite a few offers but for me it about doing the right stuff and working with people who understand what my goals are and what I am trying to do. It is very easy to sign five or six deals but I want to play tennis and concentrate on trying to win more.

'This past week, for example, it is incredibly important for me to prepare properly and train properly and practise and stuff and I don’t want to give up loads of my time. For a lot of those companies, that is a bit off-putting as this is the time of the year that they want to be doing loads of things.

'Some players are fine doing a lot the week before a Slam, but that’s not for me.'

Focused: Murray will open the play on Centre Court against Belgian David Goffin on Monday

One other thing has not happened since last year: despite him pledging to do so Murray has not declared his thoughts on Scottish independence, opting instead to drop subtle hints of pro-union tendencies. Another of those may be his choice of new sponsor – Standard Life being among the companies who have warned they may move south in the event of a Yes vote.

Of more relevance to this fortnight is the fact that the name "Mauresmo" is likely to be used more than that of ‘Perry’. If there is ever to be a matching statue at Wimbledon bearing the name ‘Murray’ he wants it to be earned.

'I don’t know if there will ever be one. Fred Perry won Wimbledon three times. I’ve still got a long way to go. I never met him but he is a very relevant person in my career because I got asked about him for a long, long time.'

With history out of the way, it should in theory be easier to add to his two Grand Slam titles. 'I feel ready. I feel good. I am moving well and my body feels good. It is not sore, so it is down to me to perform and to play well. I have prepared pretty much the best that I could.'

This is just as well because there is no sign of the competition going away and after some wobbles and injury concerns the old ‘Big Four’ are still the quartet to beat.

For Novak Djokovic it is a case of needing to lift himself after yet another Grand Slam disappointment when he lost in the Roland Garros final to Rafael Nadal. The Serb has reached two semis and three finals in his last five Majors and not converted one into a title.  That may be more relevant than concerns last week over his wrist.

Nadal’s latest win in Paris had all his traditional hallmarks, publicly expressing fears about form and fitness early on and then brilliantly building up to a crescendo of form by the end.

That kind of pattern suggests he will not fall flat again at this year’s Wimbledon, although his grass court defeats in recent years have come often enough to have left some mental scar tissue. Should he get through some awkward-looking early opponents he will be hugely dangerous, the clear favourite to me as he is the man who best knows how to win when it most matters.

Roger Federer looks threatening again this year, and this is the one place he may be able to sustain a run of seven matches. The clearest outside threat to the Big Four – and potentially Murray in the quarters - may be Queen’s champion Grigor Dimitrov, or the gargantuan-serving Milos Raonic.

You suspect this Wimbledon will go more to form than was, gloriously, the case in 2013, with better weather a factor. Expect to see three of the main four joined by one interloper in the semi-finals.
