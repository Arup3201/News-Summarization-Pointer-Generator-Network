The heart-warming moment the world's most courageous Cowardly Lion got down on one knee was captured on film by bride-to-be Pamela's daughter.

Louise Cobby began filming the stage after her mother was asked to go up from the crowd - but neither woman had any idea that Pamela's boyfriend Dave, from Hailsham, West Sussex, was going to propose.

'What a complete fluke catching this on camera,' Louise said. 'I got my camera out for the jokes and to laugh back as mum got pulled up on stage but did not expect this to happen.'

Louise Cobby captured the moment her mum Pamela was asked to go onstage at a panto, and her boyfriend Dave - dressed as the Cowardly Lion - surprised her with a proposal

Speaking today, 46-year-old Dave, who works as a care unit manager, revealed he had no idea he was going to propose to Pamela until the day before

Louise added in a personal tribute to her step-father to be: 'I'm so happy for you both I keep wanting to cry.

'Such a surprise - thank you Dave for making my mum smile and for making her so happy. It's all I've wanted for so long.'

Dave met and fell in love with Pamela, 43, a mental health nurse, at work.

In the video taken by Pamela, Dave's fellow cast-members are seen smiling and cheering as he pops the question to his love. 

Speaking today, the delighted 46-year-old, who works as a care unit manager, revealed he had no idea he was going to propose to Pamela until the day before.

Dave admitted that once he got his girlfriend on stage (pictured), he forgot the big speech he had prepared an just improvised instead

But when he got her on stage, true to his character, Dave got too nervous and forgot the big speech he had prepared.

'I couldn't have been playing a better character really,' he said of proposing while in Cowardly Lion costume.

'I've wanted to propose for a while, and I think Pam knew it was coming too, but she had no idea I was going to do it on stage. My bottle went and I couldn't remember the speech I'd written, so I just blurted it out.'

'I blushed when she said "yes," but you couldn't tell because I was in my costume'

'I'm so over the moon with it all, and absolutely delighted,' Pamela said of her husband-to-be. 'I'll definitely never forget how courageous my Cowardly Lion is'

He added: 'I blushed when she said "yes," but you couldn't tell because I was in my costume.'

Luckily for Dave, Pamela is a lifelong fan of panto.

'I thought it was a joke at first, I had to ask him if it was real,' she said.

'It was such a surprise - I'm so over the moon with it all, and absolutely delighted. I'll definitely never forget how courageous my Cowardly Lion is.'
