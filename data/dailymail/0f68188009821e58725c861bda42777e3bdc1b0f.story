The game was developed by studio Bungie, maker of the Halo franchise, and published by Activision, which is behind the Call of Duty series.

Destiny is set 700 years in the future, with Earth and humanity in the midst of a war with a mysterious entity called The Darkness and its various alien allies.

The game is an online multiplayer shooter that blurs different game genres such as role playing, rolling it into one adventure where players can meet each other.

They can work together to defeat enemies, playing as characters such as hunters, warlocks and titans – but no-one known then the game will ‘end’.

Destiny has smashed the record for the most expensive video game, which was held by Grand Theft Auto V. It launched last year and reportedly cost around £170 million ($275 million) to develop and market.

The makers of Destiny will hope that their enormous investment will pay off in a similar way.

Globally, the video game market is now thought to generate £48 billion ($80 billion) a year, with increasingly large budgets for titles.

In July, over 4.6 million people tested Destiny in what became the biggest console beta of this console generation.

Gamers around the world reported their first experiences of it on Twitter. One user wrote: ‘Am I gonna be tired at work tomorrow? Yes. Was it worth it? YES!’

Some couldn't wait to get their hands on the game, others were watching the clock as they waited to get home from work to play it for the first time.

One tweeted: ‘Hurry up postman, don't keep me waiting for Destiny all day!’

Harold Ryan, Bungie president, said: ‘Destiny is the game we’ve always wanted to make.’

‘We’ve dreamt of this universe for years, so we couldn’t be more thrilled to swing open the doors and let fans shape this experience as they tell their unique stories in the game.

‘For us, the next generation of games is all about allowing players to collide and interact with each other as they take on epic, action packed adventures all their own.’

Destiny costs around £45 and people playing it on their Xbox One, Xbox 360 or PlayStation 4 console will need to sign up to gaming services to play online, which cost around £35 a year.

There is already an expansion pack set to arrive in time for Christmas, which promises to ‘extend the Destiny adventure’ with new story missions, cooperative activities and new weapons to earn for around £20.

Described as a ‘shared world shooter,’ Destiny lets gamers play together in a huge online world.

It’s a mixture of the first person shooter and role playing game genres.

Players choose to be either a hunter, warlock or titan to battle aliens.

The story is set 700 years in the future when a massive planet-like alien called The Traveller arrives on Earth to help humans spread across the galaxy with superior technology.

But Earth’s protective alien is tracked down and almost destroyed, only protecting The Tower skyscraper – the setting for most of Destiny - leaving unfriendly aliens to raid the rest of the solar system, The Guardian reported.

In the game, players work together to slay aliens and complete missions to unlock new weapons and abilities to protect what is left of Earth.

Victories throughout the game help players ‘level up’ to open up new abilities.

All players start with a basic spaceship and mission map, showing activities available throughout the solar system, including quick ‘strike’ missions and longer explorations on Earth, the moon, Venus and Mars.

Players can communicate with friends or strangers who they invite into their team via gaming headsets.

Some missions require players to create teams to work together. Players don’t shoot each other, but work together to eliminate the enemy aliens.

Despite this, the game has an age rating of 16+ as there is a lot of violence used against the aliens.

There is no traditional end point of the game, with lots of missions to complete – and more in the pipeline.
