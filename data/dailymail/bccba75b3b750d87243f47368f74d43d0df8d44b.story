The boss of a filthy kebab shop where rats 'gnawed' at the doors while staff prepared food without washing their hands has been fined more than £1,000.

Nisar Ahmed, 42, who ran Dr Food takeaway in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, pleaded guilty to six food breaches and hygiene regulations when he appeared at Stafford Magistrates' Court yesterday.

The court heard a large dead rat was found in the food storage area of the kitchen while 'gnaw' marks from rodents were found on one of the doors.

No soap or towels were found in the food preparation area, water was leaking through the ceiling which was collected in buckets and raw burgers were stored above salad in the fridge.

Health inspectors from Stoke-on-Trent City Council also found microwave ovens, fridges and dough mixers in the kitchen were filthy after an initial inspection in February last year.

In a second visit in October, inspectors found conditions had not improved and a large decaying rat. 

Ahmed admitted failing to control pests, failing to effectively clean equipment, failing to dispose of food waste and rubbish and refuse on an outside terrace.

He also failed to train staff in food hygiene and adequately cover food in the fridge.

He was handed a 12-month community order and told to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay £1,178 in court costs.

Prosecutor Lionel Desa said: 'An examination was conducted at the Dr Food premises. Prior to the inspection the inspectors requested site food safety documents, but none were in place.

'Staff prepared food without aprons or appropriate clothing. There was no soap or towels in the preparation area.

'In general the preparation room was dirty and there was no sanitiser or disinfectant present.

Dirty: No soap or towels were found in the food preparation area and equipment were found in filthy conditions

Filthy: The conditions found by inspectors in February 2013 breached food and hygiene regulations

Lack of safety: A damaged electrical socket in the takeaway where water was leaking from the ceiling 

'During that inspection a dead rat was found on the staircase. Water was leaking from the ceiling adjacent to the staircase, with buckets to collect the water.

'Evidence of a pest control report was discovered dated January 29, 2013. It stated a pest infestation was present and it stated that the infestation was ongoing.

'Due to the state of the property and the presence of the dead rat on the premises, the local authority applied for the premises to be closed, which it was.

'A further inspection then found evidence of gnawing on one of the doors.'

The court heard Ahmed blamed the problems on a friend who he had left in charge so he could visit his mother in Pakistan.

Mohammed Khan, defending, said despite the health and safety breaches, the takeaway was still open.

He said: 'People know that Dr Food was closed down because of a dead rat and as a result there have been fewer customers walking through the door.

'He should have done a lot more with pest control.

'He accepts he is in a very sorry situation. I say that because he had no experience of how to run any of these premises before he started the shop.

'Mr Ahmed hoped to run it really well so he could live a better life. In reality he was chasing money and happiness.

'The business closed for five or six months and his landlord is trying to assist him.

'There has already been one punishment, and that's the damage to his reputation.'
