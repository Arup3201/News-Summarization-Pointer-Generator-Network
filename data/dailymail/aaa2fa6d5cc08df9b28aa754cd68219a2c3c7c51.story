Pervert: Salem Al-Majali had no less than 200 videos filmed up women's skirts in his home in Battersea, South London

A man who preyed on women in supermarkets and stations to film up their skirts have been banned from owning any kind of recording device.

Salem Al-Majali, 52, may have gathered seedy footage of 1,000 women as at least 200 recordings of unsuspecting women were found in his south London home.

Engineer Al-Majali was caught filming up the skirts of two women in Victoria Station with cameras hidden in a rucksack.

After his arrest, Al-Majali confessed to police he had preyed on hundreds of women during the last two years and that he bought cameras and camcorders specifically to make the perverted recordings.

‘It is evident the only reason he acquired the recording equipment was solely to record these footages’, prosecutor Michael Phillips told Westminster Magistrates Court.

‘He committed multiple offences over a long period of time, it was very elaborate and well organised, and having looked at the video equipment at his home, there were no less than 200 recordings.’

Al-Majali held his head in his hands throughout the court hearing as details of his sordid activities were revealed.

Police believe the upskirt video clips found on several cameras and camcorders at his south London home were shot of women in every corner of capital.

‘There were numerous images and footage of a similar nature that he had filmed at supermarkets, train stations, and other public places’, said Mr Phillips.

‘They ladies involved would certainly be very alarmed, distressed, and embarrassed if they found out what had happened.’

Al-Majali's filthy scheme was 
disrupted on July 21 this year when a security guard noticed him 
behaving suspiciously in Marks & Spencer in Victoria Station.

‘The security guard recognised the defendant as he had often seen him entering the shop’, said Mr Phillips.

‘He observed Mr Al-Majali appearing to take an interest in females, walking up very close to them.

‘He was spending much of the time by the sandwich section.

‘When they bent down to pick up an item from the freezer, Mr Al-Majali, who had a bag with him, constantly appeared to be adjusting the bag.

‘Particularly when the female customer bent down, he was seen to fiddle with the bag.’

After Al-Majali had been seen filming up the skirts of two women, the security guard followed him and called in police.

Officers found two mini-cameras and a camcorder hidden inside his bag with upskirt footage on it.

‘One of the females had been filmed three times’, Mr Phillips added.

District Judge Nicholas Evans deferred sentencing for a report on Al-Majali and possible psychiatric tests, but warned him he is facing jail.

‘I can indicate today that the court is considering custody’, he said.

Prosecutors indicated they will seek an Anti-social Behavioural Order after sentencing banning Al-Majali from carrying any kind of recording device with him, including any mobile phone with a camera.

Al-Majali, of Battersea, south London, pleaded guilty today to one count of committing an act of outraging public decency, and was released on bail on the condition he does not use the Tube except to come to court, and does not carry recording devices with him.

He is due to be sentenced at the same court on Wednesday, December 19
