As a thoroughly modern prince, William has been credited with bringing the Royal Family into the 21st Century.

But the second in line to the Throne was only too happy to play the role of ancient tyrant when he dressed up as one of Japan’s most notorious Samurai warlords.

The Prince looked positively imperious when he donned the glittering helmet and red and gold tunic of Toyotomi Hideyoshi the formidable 16th Century warrior who ruled Japan with a rod of iron.

The Duke was transformed into Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the famous Japanese warlord who unified his country in the 16th century

William donned the costume while on a visit to the set of Taiga, a long-running TV period drama which tells stories from Japan’s past.

Hideoyshi is regarded as one of Japan’s ‘great unifiers’ but his rule was characterised by a draconian clampdown on individual liberties. He introduced laws which meant only the Samurai could carry weapons and he ordered the crucifixion of 26 Christians in a bid to stop the spread of the religion.

But the Prince couldn’t help but laugh when he saw his completed look. He asked ‘How do I look?’ and when he was given his own replica weapon, he joked: ‘I feel ready for action. I feel there should be a sword in my hand.’

However William refused to wear the traditional Samurai ponytail wig because he said his younger brother Prince Harry would ‘never let him forget it’.

When he first arrived at the studios of Japan’s public broadcaster NHK he was greeted by a long line of actors dressed as soldiers and actress Mao Inoue, who was dressed in a traditional kimono.

He asked one of the senior staff, ‘Is it a show like EastEnders?’ before being taken on to the set depicting a chaya, or tea house, which Samurai warriors used as a members’ club.

Before dressing in his Samurai gear, the Prince watched three geisha actresses dance, while another played a three-stringed instrument, called a shamisen. At the end of the performance he tried strumming it himself and said, ‘It’s a wonderful noise’.

William also proved to be something of a clown prince when he joined Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on a visit to the Smile Kids’ Park in Koriyama. The Prince delighted children and politicians when he showed off his impressive juggling skills.

The Prince began a four-day visit to Japan on Thursday, and will travel on to China today.
