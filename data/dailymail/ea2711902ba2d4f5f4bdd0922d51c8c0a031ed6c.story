The celebration at held at loftSeven in L.A. which provided an ideal backdrop and included guests being greeted by two Stormtroopers upon their arrival.

'The cherry on top for both of us was getting Stormtroopers from the 501st Legion (a cosplay group) to be a part of the wedding. It was an absolute dream come true!' said Jennifer.

The troopers escorted the bride up to the entrance of the aisle and guarded the entire ceremony. Afterwards they even joined Jennifer and Joshua as photographer Cacá Santoro took photos of the bride and groom on the streets of downtown L.A.

Later the newlyweds enjoyed a dance dance with light sabers in theirs hands.
