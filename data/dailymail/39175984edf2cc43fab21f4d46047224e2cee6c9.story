Over the limit: David Bye, 88, was driving his Skoda on the A14 when he was stopped in Felixstowe, Suffolk, by police and breathalyzed

A frail pensioner who is believed to be Britain's oldest drink-driver has been banned from the road - at the age of 88.

David Bye failed a breath test after an off duty police officer saw him driving his grey Skoda erratically on the A14 near Felixstowe, Suffolk.

Mr Bye of Ipswich, Suffolk, who walks with two sticks, was helped by two women relatives as he shuffled into South East Suffolk magistrates' court on Wednesday.

He struggled to hear and tapped his hearing aid as the court clerk shouted questions at him to confirm his name and address.

Bye of Ipswich admitted drink-driving and was given a 12 month driving ban. He was also fined £140 and ordered to pay £85 costs and a £20 victim surcharge.

Prosecutor Lesla Small said the off duty officer who was behind Mr Bye saw him driving 'very slowly' and crossing the central white lines in the road at 8pm on December 15 last year.

She said: 'Officers responded to the information they received about the vehicle Mr Bye was driving along the A14 towards Felixstowe.

'The information they were given was that it was being driven in an extremely erratic manner. The officer got the vehicle to stop and noticed he was extremely unsteady on his feet. That was partly due to his elderly age.

'A roadside breath test was conducted and was positive. He was then taken to the police station.'A second breath test at the station showed he had 43mcsgs of alcohol in 100mls of breath, slightly over the legal limit of 35mcs. Mr Bye was given an opportunity to have a blood test which showed he had 94mgs of alcohol in 100mls of blood. The legal limit is 80mgs.

Ms Small added: 'The officer has put a
note on the files. He states that the vehicle he was driving has now 
been sold and the DVLA have been notified about his medical condition.

'The officer says that Mr Bye said he
only had one drink, but it contained more alcohol than he realised. The
officer thought it was a total misjudgement error on his part.'

Penalty: Mr Bye was banned from driving for 12 months at South East Suffolk Magistrates Court (pictured)

Ms Small confirmed that Bye had no previous convictions or cautions, other than a speeding conviction last November.

District Judge Celia Dawson told the pensioner: 'I appreciate this must be very difficult for you because you are 88-years-old and you have never been in court before. I am pleased you have sold your car. Is it your intention to give up driving? 'Mr Bye replied: 'I think so - at my age. I am 88 now.'

Judge Dawson told him she would have ordered him to take a re-test after his driving ban if he thought he would get behind the wheel again.

However, she warned him that if he drove during the period of his ban he would be committing 'a very serious imprisonable offence.'

Britain's previous oldest drink driver is believed to have been D-Day Navy veteran Rennie Carr who was found to be nearly twice the legal limit in 2007 when he was aged 86. Mr Carr was banned after police saw him driving his Honda Prelude on the wrong side of the road in Blackpool, Lancashire.
