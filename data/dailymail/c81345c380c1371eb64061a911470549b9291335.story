Rory McIlroy predicted there would be some surprises among the European pairings and Paul McGinley certainly hinted at one yesterday when he suggested the world No 1 would not be partnering fellow Northern Irishman Graeme McDowell.

Throughout the summer the Europe captain had said they would play together at some point, and never mind that their relationship had become strained owing to a management dispute involving McIlroy and Horizon Sports, who used to look after the affairs of both men.

The players had been painstaking in their efforts to show their friendship is back on track. Three weeks ago, McDowell spoke of how he was hoping to partner McIlroy while, in an interview with Sportsmail last week, the latter returned the compliment.

However, McGinley appears to have had a change of heart. 

'Three or four months ago I had a strong view they would play together but the more I look at their statistics I'm thinking there may be value in not doing it,' he said. 

'They've played six Ryder Cup matches together and won two. If I don't decide to pair them it would only be for tactical reasons.

'Both of them have assured me all along that there's no issues and that's the way I've always seen it. Whether they come together or not is another story.'

McGinley can protest as much as he likes but if they don't play together it would inevitably lead to speculation and could prove a distraction.

McGinley was speaking at the first press conference of Ryder Cup week, in conjunction with American captain Tom Watson. The first practice sessions begin today when the two start to play their hand publicly.
