As Liverpool swap one controversial character for another, Sportsmail look at some of the similarities between Mario Balotelli and Luis Suarez.  

APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION

Luis Suarez has bitten three players in his career, the latest Italy’s Georgio Chiellini at the World Cup. Suarez was banned from football for four months, though he was allowed to return to training last week. While not as destructive, Mario Balotelli was fined £100,000 at Man City for throwing darts at a youth player and got into a training ground scrap with manager Roberto Mancini.

HELPING HANDS

Fighting managers aside, Balotelli has been involved in a few hand-outs. He donated money to his local church before allegedly roaming the streets of Manchester dressed as Santa Claus handing out free cash. Suarez famously handballed on the line to stop Ghana from scoring at the 2010 World Cup and also refused to shake Patrice Evra’s hand after being found guilty of racially abusing the French defender.

T-SHIRT TROUBLES

Suarez and his Liverpool team-mates wore t-shirts of support (right) after he was banned for eight games for abusing Evra. While at Inter, Balotelli angered his own fans after wearing rivals AC Milan’s kit and he celebrated scoring in the Manchester derby with his ‘Why Always Me?’ t-shirt.

FIREWORKS DISPLAY

Normally a metaphor, Balotelli provided literal fireworks at City when he nearly set his house on fire after letting some off in his bathroom. He later became an ambassador for firework safety. Though not quite as explosive, Suarez’s behaviour has prompted some fiery reactions. His dive against Everton in 2011 led to Jack Rodwell being sent off and a year later he celebrated a goal against the same team by diving in front of the Everton dugout.

P.S. Liverpool was never a happy hunting ground for Balotelli. In four matches against them for City he never won a game, let alone scored a goal. He also managed to get sent off in November 2011, lasting just 18 minutes as a sub before picking up two bookings.

Discipline: Balotelli was sent off four times during his times at Manchester City, often at important times

CAR CRASH (August 2010)

Just days after signing for City, Balotelli hits the headlines after crashing his Audi R8 en route to the club's training ground. Balotelli was found carrying £5,000 in cash at the time of the accident and when police asked why, he reportedly replied: 'Because I am rich.'

FIRST RED CARD (November 2010)

Balotelli scored his first Premier League goals in a 2-0 win at West Brom but the achievement was marred when he was sent off following a clash with Youssouf Mulumbu.

WILSHERE SNUB (December 2010)

City boss Roberto Mancini said Balotelli must change his attitude following his claims he had never heard of Jack Wilshere after beating the Arsenal midfielder to FIFA's Young Player of the Year award.

DART-THROWING INCIDENT (March 2011)

Balotelli again hit trouble after it emerged he threw a dart at a City youth team player. No one was hurt in the incident and he escaped punishment.

SECOND RED CARD (March 2011)

Balotelli apologised to his team-mates after being sent off during a Europa League tie with Dynamo Kiev for a reckless challenge on Goran Popov.

BACK-HEEL BLUNDER (July 2011)

Balotelli was immediately substituted by an enraged Mancini after performing a pirouette and back-heeling wide when clean through on goal in a pre-season friendly against LA Galaxy.

FIREWORK INCIDENT (October 2011)

The Italian had another run-in with the emergency services after a firework was set off in the bathroom of his home, triggering a fire. The next day, he scored in the Manchester derby and celebrated by revealing a T-shirt which read 'Why always me?'

THIRD RED CARD (November 2011)

The third red card of Balotelli's City career arrived in a league match against Liverpool, the 21-year-old dismissed for two yellow cards.

BREAKING CURFEW (December 2011)

Balotelli broke a club 48-hour curfew by visiting a curry house ahead of a match against Chelsea.

RICHARDS CLASH (December 2011)

Just days after Balotelli's curfew lapse, he again attracted negative headlines after pictures emerged of a training-ground bust-up with team-mate Micah Richards.

PARKER CLASH (January 2012)

Balotelli was charged with violent conduct by the Football Association, and subsequently handed a four-match ban, after appearing to stamp on the head of Tottenham's Scott Parker during a Premier League match.

INTER PRESS CONFERENCE (March 2012)

Balotelli gatecrashed the press conference to announce the appointment of Andrea Stramaccioni as Inter Milan's new coach.

FOURTH RED CARD (April 2012)

Balotelli was sent off for two bookable challenges on Arsenal full-back Bacary Sagna. He was also guilty of a shocking knee-high challenge on Gunners midfielder Alex Song.

CLASH WITH MANCINI (January 2013)

Balotelli clashed with Mancini during training with the pair pulled apart by coaches.
