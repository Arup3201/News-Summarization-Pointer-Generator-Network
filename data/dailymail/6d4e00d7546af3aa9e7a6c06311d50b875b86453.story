Andros Townsend has spoken of his frustration at not playing regularly for Tottenham with Mauricio Pochettino reluctant to use the winger in the Barclays Premier League.

Townsend was selected in Roy Hodgson’s 26-man England squad for games against Slovenia and Scotland next week, but has fallen out of favour at White Hart Lane.

The winger has played just 109 minutes in four substitute Premier League appearances this season, and has mainly been used in the Europa League and Capital One Cup.

The 23-year-old opened the scoring against Asteras Tripolis on Thursday in the Europa League with a penalty, before going on to set Harry Kane up to double Tottenham’s lead in Greece.

It was Townsend’s first goal and assist in the competition as the north London club won 2-1.

And the attacker has been looking to Kane for inspiration who, while awaiting a senior England call up, is being handed more Premier League opportunities by Pochettino.

‘It’s difficult. You are a footballer and you want to play every week and every single game but you have got to be patient,’ Townsend said.

‘When you get your Europa League or Capital One Cup games you have got to make an impression like Harry Kane has done.

‘You have got to score goals and make yourself hard to drop and I think Harry Kane has done that.

‘He has got 10 goals in cup games, he has made himself hard to drop and I am looking to do the same for now.’

Townsend’s selection comes a year after he scored against Montenegro at Wembley as England all but guaranteed their place at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

The goal was later voted the fans’ favourite of qualifying, although the winger missed the tournament in Brazil due to ankle ligament damage.

But the man who has been on loan to nine different clubs since 2009 believes his most recent call up can help his Premier League ambitions.

‘The last time I got called up I trained really well,’ he added. ‘I was rewarded with 25 minutes against San Marino and scored another goal so it was good the manager (Hodgson) showed faith in me.

‘I'm going to go away, work my socks off for a week, 10 days, and hopefully I can get some more game time.

‘I think the manager (Pochettino) realises every time I have been called upon for my country I have done myself justice.

‘So hopefully I can keep playing well when called upon for my national team and come back to my club after that and hopefully establish myself in the Premier League.’
