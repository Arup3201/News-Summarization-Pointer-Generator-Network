Police investigating the death of a woman who feel to her death from a hang glider have seized a video card recording her final minutes - after it was apparently swallowed by her instructor.

Lenami Godinez-Avila, 27, was celebrating an anniversary with her boyfriend with a hang-gliding excursion in the Canadian province of British Columbia.

But tragedy struck when she tumbled out of her harness only seconds after take-off.

Witnesses said the young woman fell almost 1,000 feet to her death while her boyfriend, David, watched.

Police said her boyfriend had been waiting for his turn for a ride at the time of the incident last Saturday.

Hang glider pilot Jon Orders has been held in custody following allegations that he swallowed a video card which may have recorded events leading up to the incident.

He was granted bail yesterday when he appeared in a provincial court in Chilliwack, British Columbia.

Earlier this week, Royal Canadian Mounted Police told a court that X-rays showed the card was inside Orders' body.

But officers confirmed yesterday that they now have the card.

'We
have processes in place in order to try and extract what's been on the 
card that will not be further discussed at the moment,' Police Constable
Tracy Wolbeck said.

Ms Wolbeck said police were focusing on answering questions from Miss Godinez-Avila's family, from Mexico.

'They've come to Canada in search of answers,' the police officer added.

Police have not provided any further details about when the card was consumed or how they learned about it.

They have also said they have seized video taken by the boyfriend on the ground.

Orders is a fully certified hang-gliding pilot and instructor with 16 years' experience.

His business website, Vancouver Hang Gliding, states that photos and video are available when people purchase a tandem hang-gliding trip.

When police announced the charge on Monday, they said Orders was accused of withholding key evidence.

The young woman's body was found in a forest clear cut below Mount Woodside, a popular spot for hang gliders to launch from above British Columbia's Fraser Valley.

Jason Warner, safety officer for the Hang Gliders and Paragliders Association of Canada, said that he spoke to Orders minutes after Godinez-Avila fell from the glider.

Mr Warner said Orders told him he knew something was wrong almost immediately and tried desperately to hang on to the woman, who clung to his body and then slipped down his legs, taking one of Orders' shoes with her.

A witness, Nicole McLearn, told CBC that when the glider was in the air, Miss Godinez-Avila appeared to be wearing her harness, but it wasn't attached to the glider.

The passenger clung to Orders before she fell, Ms McLearn said.

'He was horizontal but she was now hanging vertically, and it looked like in essence she had him in a bear hug around the chest area,' Ms McLearn added.

Miss Godinez-Avila, who was an 
administrator at the provincial Ministry of Environment, went hang 
gliding after her boyfriend bought her lessons for their anniversary.

He was video-recording the flight, but had stopped taping before she fell.

Friends of Miss Godinez-Avila have set up a memorial fund and scholarship to remember her.

One friend, Katherine Louman-Gardiner, told CTV News: 'She was a bright and caring, charismatic person and we miss her terribly.

'She loved contributing to the community around her.'

Miss Godinez-Avila's former professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada, Anil Hira, paid tribute to her.

'She was just starting out, she was extremely successful, someone who walks on air, very light-hearted but extremely capable.

'It's the last person you would want to see this happen to.'

The woman's death marks the second high-profile fatality related to hang gliding in recent months.

In October, 16-year-old Lois Preston, described as an experienced pilot, died from injuries sustained when her glider crashed in Ashbourne in England.
