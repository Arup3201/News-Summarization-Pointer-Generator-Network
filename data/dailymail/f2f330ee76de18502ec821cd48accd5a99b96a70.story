A homeless dog received a makeover that saved his life after being taken to a kill shelter. 

Charlie the Shelter Dog was found earlier this year on the side of a Los Angeles road and taken to a high-kill shelter. 

The Inquisitr reports that most dogs who aren't adopted don't last more than a week in the shelters that euthanize more than half the dogs in their custody. 

Charlie's story would have come to a sad end, but a groomer from Hollywood Grooming, a pet grooming shop in Los Angeles, came to the rescue and gave Charlie the makeover that landed him in a new home.

Found: Charlie the Shelter Dog received a drastic makeover after being found earlier this year on the side of a Los Angeles road and taken to a high-kill shelter

The groomer shaved off Charlie's matted, knotted fur that was riddled with painful burrs and gave the pup a much-needed bath. 

In a video posted by The Pet Collective, Charlie is seen on a grooming table shaking and looks to be terrified. Much of his fur is discolored and the pup's eyes are barely visible beneath the matted fur surrounding and burrs hanging from his face. 

In the end, Charlie is completely unrecognizable. His dark brown eyes are visible and the groomer completes his look by tying a brown, paw-printed bandana around the pup's neck.

Adoption: Charlie would have met his end at a high-kill shelter that euthanizes more than 50 percent of the dogs in their custody, but he received a makeover that is believed to have led to his adoption

The Pet Collective reports that Charlie was adopted two days later. The touching video has received more than 8 million views on YouTube.  

Dogster reports that four other dogs were given makeovers that day, and all were adopted just days after the visit. 

'Professional makeovers, whether for humans or dogs, are often dismissed as mere vanity or narcissism,' a blogger for Dogster wrote, 'but as Pet Collective videos show, they can be a very important part of caring for one's physical or mental health.'
