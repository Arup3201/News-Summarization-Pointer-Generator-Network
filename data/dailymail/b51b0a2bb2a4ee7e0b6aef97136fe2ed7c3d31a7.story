A crop of cannabis plants was found growing in council flower pots put on display to brighten up a city.

More than 20 illegal plants were seen sprouting among colourful begonias and petunias decorating the streets of Newport, South Wales.

They were admired by shoppers and passers-by who didn't realise the pot plants actually contained pot.

More than 20 illegal plants were seen sprouting among colourful begonias and petunias decorating the streets

Police were called in to investigate but by the time they arrived the plants had been harvested.

Whoever planted them has been benefiting from Newport Council's gardeners fertilising and watering them.

Some
of the leafy cannabis plants were found less than half a mile from 
Newport's central police station and officers have walked past them 
every day.

They were found 
by businessman Dean Beddis, 29, who said: 'I had never seen cannabis 
growing in the wild before so it was crazy to see it.

'I thought Newport was trying to be a new Amsterdam and doing its best to win the City in Bloom competition.

'It's actually rather a beautiful plant and stood out wonderfully. But they have gone now. I don't know who took them.'

A Newport Council spokesman said: 'It's a serious issue and we will be informing the police and checking our CCTV cameras.'

A Gwent Police spokesman said: 'Now that the plants have apparently disappeared it's difficult to determine whether they were in fact illegal cannabis plants or not, and if so, whether they had been deliberately planted for cultivation.'

Council workers had been feeding and watering the plants, ensuring that they are now blooming

Admiring passers by were clueless of the type of plant that was growing in the council pots
