The boom in beekeeping may be doing our countryside more harm than good.

For a surge in the number of bumblebee hives means thousands of colonies are being imported.

And many of these are riddled with parasites that pose a threat to native species, a study has found.

With British bees already in peril, scientists say the trade must be tightened up.

Commercial gardeners have long kept bumblebees to boost the pollination of their crops. But recently home owners have joined the trend, to do their bit for the environment.

As a result, the number of bumblebee colonies imported from the continent each year has soared to between 40,000 and 50,000.

However, research from Leeds, Stirling and Sussex Universities found that many of the foreign colonies harbour dangerous bugs.

The study of 48 bumblebee colonies 
bought from three European suppliers found 77 per cent to be infected. 
Eight different parasites were found and some colonies contained several
 different diseases.

Passed
 to our native bees, these parasites could deform their wings, leaving 
them unable to fly, shorten their life or even kill.

Sussex University researcher William Hughes said: ‘Some of the parasites damage fat stores, many reduce lifespan. They can also affect the ability of the insect to learn and can be lethal.’

One of the bugs found on the bumblebees can be passed to honeybees, where it deforms wings to such an extent the insects cannot fly.

Some strains may be new to Britain and there are fears that having high numbers of these bees near plants visited by native insects will speed up the spread of disease.

Britain’s bumblebees are already in peril, with intensive farming, changing climate, pollution and disease blamed for two of the 25 native species going extinct and many others struggling to survive.

Commercial gardeners use the foreign colonies to boost production of crops such as tomatoes and strawberries in greenhouses and polytunnels.

In recent years, home gardeners have also started to buy them and pay up to £100 for a cardboard box of bumblebees to be delivered to their home.

The colony, with a queen and up to 100 worker bees, can be used to pollinate lavender and other plants.

The researchers, whose study was published in the Journal of Applied Ecology,  want tighter import controls, with bees checked for disease on arrival in the UK.

Professor Hughes said: ‘If we don’t act, then the risk is that tens of thousands of parasite-carrying colonies may be imported in the UK each year.’
