Up to 49 per cent of British travellers who have never visited France think it is excessively expensive, according to a survey by Post Office Travel Money

British travellers appear to have made their minds up about France - even if they have never been across the Channel.

Up to 49 per cent of people who have never visited the country feel it is excessively expensive, according to a survey by Post Office Travel Money.

And of those who have been to France, only half believe it represents good value for money.

The survey was carried out on 2,085 UK adults who had holidayed in a range of destinations across the globe.

Turkey was found to be the best value-for-money destination - followed by mainland Spain, Greece and Portugal.

Based on perception rather than actual visits, Bulgaria was seen to offer the best value - with Turkey, mainland Spain and Croatia also considered reasonably priced.

But Dubai was ranked bottom of the list, with only 38 per cent of British travellers deeming it a good value-for-money destination.

In terms of the destination to which most people would return, Turkey was voted top.

Around two-thirds of travellers who had visited the country before declared they would go back.

And 63 per cent of the people surveyed said they would return to mainland Spain.

But - on a value-for-money basis - only 29 per cent would go back to Dubai, a third would return to France and just 40 per cent would make another trip to Italy, the survey found.

Researchers also discovered that despite setting aside an average of £552 in spending money, most travellers go over their budget by around £242.

Andrew Brown, of Post Office Travel Money, said: 'Our new research shows the extent to which value is a determining factor in destination choice.

'Holidaymakers can best arm themselves with information that will help them to make informed decisions about value by monitoring exchange rates to see where sterling has strengthened most this year.'
