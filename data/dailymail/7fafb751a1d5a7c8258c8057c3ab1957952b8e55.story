Dove's long-running Real Beauty campaign is being called into question by an advocate for the FTC's Truth in Advertising act, for perhaps not being so 'real' after all.

Seth Matlins, a father-of-two and former high-powered advertising executive based in Los Angeles, California, has launched a petition aimed at Dove on Change.org, which has so far garnered 3,758 signatures.

Although he doesn't outright accuse the beauty giant of any specific wrongdoing, Mr Matlins is asking for two 'Hero Pledges': full disclosure to its customers as to whether it has or hasn't Photoshopped its images, and the avoidance of running Photoshopped ads where kids can see them, i.e. 'billboards, bus shelters, mall kiosks, and the back covers of magazines.'

Demands: Seth Matlins' petition (pictured) asks Dove to lets consumers know when it has Photoshopped an image, and if it has, to display these images only where kids can't readily see them

The petition, which is 1,241 signatures away from its goal, is accompanied by a still from Dove's own 2006 campaign; a time lapse video which sees a make-up free model styled, transformed and aggressively Photoshopped, and ends with the caption: 'No wonder our perception of beauty is distorted.'

Mr Matlins' petition reads: 'As a father of two young children, I've always appreciated the idea behind Dove's Real Beauty campaign, and the brand's understanding that the way women and girls are portrayed, both literally (through words) and visually (in pictures), has a big impact on how they view themselves and who they aspire to be.'

The outspoken father has an eight-year-old daughter and a seven-year-old son, and runs a blog with his wife Eva called Feel More Better, with the aim of building children's self-esteem.

He argues that Photoshopped ads should be kept out of the sights of impressionable youths because 'kids don't have the ability to process or understand what they're seeing.'

Mr Matlins claims he is 'starting' with Dove because: 'They've been championing ‘Real Beauty’ for ten years, and because they know more about the health consequences created by the false, unrealistic representations of women and girls in Photoshopped advertising, than most.'

He points to Dove's own research, which is listed on its website and states that while 72per cent of girls globally feel 'tremendous' pressure to be beautiful, only 22per cent are actually comfortable describing themselves as such.

Mr Matlins hopes that Dove will lead the way in signing the Truth in Advertising Pledge and thus encouraging other advertisers to follow. 'If they don't,' he says, 'Let's ask them why not...after a decade of "real beauty" it seems a fair question.'

'Dove takes great care to realistically portray women by accurately depicting their natural shape, size, skin color and age'

In a statement to the New York Daily News, Dove said: 'When the Dove Campaign for Real Beauty launched in 2004, we made a commitment to all women that we would not distort any of our images to create an unrealistic view of beauty.

'Dove takes great care to realistically portray women by accurately depicting their natural shape, size, skin color and age, thereby representing them as they genuinely are.'

Parents: Mr Matlins (center left) has an eight-year-old daughter (left) and a seven-year-old son (right), and runs a blog with his wife Eva (center right) called Feel More Better, with the aim of building children's self-esteem

Concerns: The father said, 'Two weeks ago, my daughter [far left and far right] looks up at me as I'm putting her to bed and she says, "Daddy, do you think I'm ugly?"'

In a May interview with Fashionista, Mr Matlins opened up about why he left his 'successful' and 'lucrative' career in advertising to stand on the opposite side and campaign for stricter regulations in the very same industry.

'I left behind a pretty successful 
career to do this... But if I can help my kids 
and other kids grow up happier, I'll feel good'

'Two weeks ago, my daughter - apropos to nothing - looks up at me as I'm putting her to bed and she says, "Daddy, do you think I'm ugly?"' he told the publication. 'My heart shatters into a thousand pieces, and I don't even know what to say.'

He added: 'I left behind a pretty successful career to do this, and sometimes I look at the big check I didn't cash every two weeks and I think, "That was dumb!" But if I can help my kids and other kids grow up happier, I'll feel good.'
