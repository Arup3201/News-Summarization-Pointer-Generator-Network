Many couples decide to tie the knot in an intimate setting with just close family on the guest list.

And now a retired minister from Virginia has built his own travelling wedding chapel measuring just 100 square feet offering wedding services for as little as $100 (£66).

Bil Malbon, 59, came up with the idea for building the chapel on wheels after he retired in 2013 after stumbling across a website dedicated to building tiny houses.

The Tiny Chapel built by retired minister Bil Malbon, which he plans on taking on the road, offering cut-price wedding services to couples 

The inside of the Tiny Chapel measures just 100 square feet, with couples able to invite up to 25 guests, with packages starting from $100 

Over the next few months Mr Malbon, who has been officiating weddings since 1992, began attending housing workshops.

He then began building the chapel in April 2014, and completed his first ceremony, renewing the vows of Thom and Midge Stanton, in October.

The chapel even features a retractable spire, which can be removed when the building is on the road.

Wedding packages start from $100 with hour-long full wedding services on a weekend costing $500 (£330).

Mr Malbon first started working on building the chapel in 2014 after attending several workshops on how to build your own tiny house

Mr Malbon said: 'A little over ten years ago I started thinking about about what I wanted to do when I retired from state government.

'I'd been officiating weddings since 1992 and decided I would build a grand wedding chapel.

'This is just our first year of business and the wedding season hasn't really started yet.

'We have a few bookings already and out hopes are that as the weather warms up, more couples planning tiny weddings give us a call.'

On Saturday, the chapel will host its full wedding service in Richmond, Virginia, when Patricia Moran and Josh Farrar tie the knot.

After being completed late last year, the first service to be held by Mr Malbon in the chapel was the vow renewal of couple Thom and Midge Stanton, pictured

Miss Moran said: 'We knew from the beginning we wanted a small, intimate wedding with a guest list of only close family members.

'Our search was coming up empty as I refused to pay over $500 to rent an over-sized location.

'Then we found the Tiny Chapel and I knew it was perfect.'
