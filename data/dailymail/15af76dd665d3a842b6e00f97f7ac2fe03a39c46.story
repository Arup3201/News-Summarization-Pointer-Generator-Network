Sales of a smartphone game whose goal is to wipe out the human race with a deadly disease have shot up as Ebola dominates global headlines.

Users' morbid fascination with the outbreak gained Plague Inc almost a million extra players in two weeks - a period which saw the death toll pass 4,000 and new infections in the U.S. and Spain.

The goal of the app is to ‘bring about the end of human history by evolving a deadly, global plague’, and users - many of whom are naming their pathogen after the pandemic - receive 'victory' messages when they win.

Morbid: Smartphone users have flocked to play a game, released in 2012, whose goal is to eliminate all life on earth with a deadly virus - and since they can call it whatever they like, many have called theirs Ebola

Choose your weapon: Players can choose bacteria, a virus, a fungus, a parasite or a 'bio-weapon'

The game can produce messages such as: 'Victory! Ebola has successfully eliminated all life on Earth'

Players infect a ‘Patient Zero’ before working to evolve their pathogen, which they can give a name of their choice.

As they win ‘DNA points’, players can add symptoms like cysts and tumours while making their virus more contagious and immune to modern drugs.

They can choose a world where no one washes their hands - or one where many countries have state-of-the-art hospital care.

Now tens of thousands of players are highlighting the grim comparison with Ebola, with many even naming their imaginary disease after the virus.

London-based James Vaughan, 27, spent a year developing the game in his free time for just £2,500 in 2012, and it has since been downloaded more than 35million times.

It has consistently dominated the iPhone download charts and hit the number one paid-for spot in the UK last week. 

The game was already popular long before recent headlines over the outbreak, said Mr Vaughan, but it had a sharp rise in use in the last few weeks. 

Last week more than 430,000 new players downloaded the app, he told MailOnline - a rise of 147,000, more than 50 per cent, on the same figure two weeks earlier.

The total number of players last week was almost 4million - a rise of 923,000 on the figure two weeks before that.

The app's ability to auto-post to Twitter had led to messages many would think distasteful - such as: 'My virus, called Ebola, just wiped out the world in 544 days!'.

Another declared: 'Victory! Ebola has successfully eliminated all life on Earth'.

Several players have joked about fleeing to Greenland while one Twitter user, @GreerSimms, wrote: 'Ebola is just the real life version of Plague Inc'.

But the entrepreneur insists the app can be a force for good, and is now in talks with charities about putting some of the proceeds towards victims. 

Deadly: While the game is free on Android, iPhone users can pay to genetically mutate their deadly pathogen

Bonus: Players who do well can give their virus symptoms such as cysts, tumours and total organ failure

'There will be people queuing up to say it's a cash grab, and that couldn't be further from the truth', Mr Vaughan told MailOnline.

'It would be infinitely better if the Ebola outbreak had never happened at all, but I want to use the position that Plague Inc has to try and help in whatever way I can.'

Mr Vaughan has fans in high places - including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the body in charge of containing the Ebola cases in Dallas and New York.

He was invited last year to help CDC staff with their public awareness campaigns, with CDC director Ali S Khan claiming the game 'creates a compelling world that engages the public on serious public health topics.’

Economics graduate Mr Vaughan said he is now in 'detailed' talks with major charities about giving away some of the game's profits towards the Western effort to contain the disease.

His firm, Ndemic Creations, has not published its profits but has an office near London Bridge and seven staff around the world.

The app is free for Android users while costing 99p for iPhone users, alongside 'top-up' charges to unlock advanced features of the game such as genetic mutations to their disease’s DNA.

Mr Vaughan said the game's popularity since 2012 has built a 'very solid foundation' financially but added: 'Ebola has not had a significant impact on revenues – the majority of our downloads come from Android'.

‘This hasn’t been the biggest increase we’ve had in our downloads in 2014 but I think this is the first time a real world situation has been the reason why people are getting the game,' he said.

'Players are often interested in real-world issues, and frequently discuss diseases and the science behind them. Recently, we have seen that tens of thousands of Plague Inc players are talking about Ebola on game forums and social media.

'They mention how scary it is to see things they have learnt from Plague Inc being talked about on the news or how seeing a disease simulation on a map reminds them of the game.

'People may see Plague Inc as a dark game, but that is because it focuses on very serious real world issues and makes people think about them. It holds a mirror up to the world and shows the player the true horror of diseases like Ebola and why we must do everything we can to stop them.'

Of the West's response to the outbreak, he added: 'We should have been doing more months and months ago.'

The death toll from the outbreak - which started ten months ago - now stands at 4,877.

Western coverage has been particularly intense in the last month after the first fresh infections outside Africa, in Spain and the U.S.

Warnings from health bodies have also become more stark as the death toll, which until early August remained below 1,000, has ramped up. 

There have now been 9,936 probable, suspected and confirmed cases of Ebola, mostly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, with transmission in some areas remaining 'intense'.

World Health Organisation (WHO) figures suggest the real death toll could be as high as 15,000.
