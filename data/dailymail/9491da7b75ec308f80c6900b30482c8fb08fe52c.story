Investigators are piecing together the details of a devastating boating accident in Florida that claimed the lives of four young people, but one victim's family says it doesn't matter what happened; all that matters is that their daughter is gone.

The devastated parents of Kelsie Karpiak, 24, who was killed when three boats collided in Dinner Key Marina have spoken about their heartbreak at the loss of their daughter.

Rosanna and Craig Karpiak said their daughter wasn't even planning to go out the night of the accident, but received a last minute call from a friend.

'The only thing that matters is that my daughter's gone and nothing's going to bring her back,' Craig Karpiak told NBC.

'It doesn't matter, the investigation will be what it is and what happened, happened.'

Also killed were 23-year-olds Andrew Garcia and Tori Dempsey who were on the boat with Karpiak. The fourth victim was Jason Soleimani, 23, who was aboard another boat.

Another victim, Catherine Payan, 24, is in hospital in a coma with serious brain injuries.

Kelsie Karpiak was due to return to Jacksonville to work with a dance company Monday, but instead, her parents must plan for her funeral.

'Our family is devastated and there's three other families in this city that are devastated also, all young kids and that's all that matters,' Craig Karpiak said.

Rosanna Karpiak says she has gotten some measure of comfort knowing that her daughter is with God.

'Life is short and as it is and you have to be ready and our daughter was ready,' Rosanna Karpiak told NBC. 'She believed in Jesus and she was saved and I know that she's in heaven and I know it because God has comforted my heart.'

The horrific scene unfolded after 
10.30pm after the three boats, including a 36-foot yacht collided in 
what authorities called a 'mad dash' for the marina.

The other two boats
 were smaller fishing-type watercrafts, said police.

Multiple
 law enforcement agencies responded to the crash Friday night near the 
Dinner Key Marina in Miami, with officers plucking several people out of
 the water.

Garcia, an avid fisherman and boater, is believed to have been behind the wheel of the vessel carrying Karpiak and Payan, as well as another female, when it slammed into another boat, police sources told WSVN.

He was instantly ejected into the water as the boat ricocheted into another one - his body was found in the harbor along with Dempsey's, police said.

Payan sustained severe head trauma, sources told WSVN, her long-term prognosis is not known.

Rescuers
 were alerted by one of the boaters at about 10:45pm He said he'd 
been hit by another vessel and that his 36-foot pleasure craft was 
taking on water, authorities said.

'We kept getting report after report of more people in the water,' Miami Fire Rescue Lt. Ignatius Carroll said during a press briefing.

The chaotic scene only grew worse as police had trouble determining how many people were actually in the water.

'The numbers kept growing and growing,' said Carroll.

Eight people were initially transported to Miami hospitals.

Garcia's father aided in the search for his son.

'I’ve paid the ultimate price, I’m out on my boat looking for my son’s body,' his father Jack Garcia texted a WFOR reporter. Jack Garcia is a retired fire boat captain from Miami-Dade Fire-Rescue.

Carroll detailed the manic search and rescue effort in the moments after the crash in comments reported by the Miami Herald.

EMTs were simultaneously performing CPR on three people as shouts of more bodies in the water kept calling out.

Boats were going back and forth from water to land with people scooped to safety.

'We had boats motorcading back and forth bringing in injured people,' said Carroll.

'They were out there in the dark. What was really challenging was you don’t know how many people were on the boats.

'There were people who were traumatized, injured, confused,' said Carroll.

'We weren’t getting accurate counts of people. We were trying to determine, did we have everybody? And then we found out there was still a possibility two people were still missing'.

The boaters are believed to have been taking in a fireworks display a short time earlier.

'My understanding is they may have been out there enjoying the fireworks display, and typically after the fireworks are over, everyone makes a mad dash for the nearest marina,' said Jorge Pino, a public information officer with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.

However, Pino cautioned that the exact circumstances were still under investigation.

Carroll recounted how anxious relatives waited for news of their loved ones at the dock. One man, he recalled, worried about his two grandchildren. Both arrived safely to shore.

'We were relieved to be able to let him know that they were OK,' Carroll said.

Karpiak was a cheerleader during high school and even performed in the 2007 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, according to the Miami Herald.
