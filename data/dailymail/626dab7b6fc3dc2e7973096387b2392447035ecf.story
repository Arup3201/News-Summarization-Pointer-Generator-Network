Passengers aboard the stricken Delta flight which skidded off the runway at New York City's La Guardia airport thought they were going to die, survivors revealed today.

Speaking of their terror as Flight 1086 from Atlanta almost slammed into Flushing Bay as heavy snow battered the airport, the passengers said they considered themselves very fortunate.

Husband and wife, Sam Stern and Roxanne Joffe were sat in the exit row of the jet and as it became clear the landing was going very wrong, feared the worst.

'It was snowing and the plane hit the ground. It seemed as if the brakes took for a second and then the plane started accelerating and it was obvious it wasn't going to stop. I thought I was going to die,' said Joffe to WTSP.

'When it finally came to a stop, there was deadly, deadly silence.'

As the plane skidded, Joffe said she thought they were going to go straight into the water, like US Airways Flight 1549 - the famous 'Miracle on the Hudson'.

Of the 127 passengers and five crew aboard, only two were injured.

Joffe's husband, Sam Stern, also thought the crash was the end.

'I was in the exit row,' said Stern, 64, of Sarasota, Florida, to the New York Post.

'I had to pull the window in. They always ask you, ‘Are you prepared, willing and able to assist in the event of an evacuation?.

'But you never expect it’ll happen to you.'

While the terrifying landing was unfolding, Stern's wildest fears were racing.

'In my mind, I was thinking, ‘Holy cow, are we going to flip over? Spin out?' said Stern.

'They managed to keep the nose forward. Finally, we hit this fence. The left side of the plane was looking over the water.

'The guy sitting right opposite me, he thought we were going in the water. He said he was thinking about the plane crash in the Hudson.'

LaGuardia was shut down soon after the incident as the plane was leaking 300 gallons of fuel at a rate of a gallon a minute, with all incoming flights being diverted and outgoing flights being grounded.

The fuel leak was quickly contained.

Once the plane hit the runway it did not respond to the tower, and as soon as the air traffic controllers realized what happened they immediately announced the airport was closed.  

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey reported that two planes that landed just before the Delta flight reported good breaking on the runway, and that the plane skid roughly 5,000 feet down the runway. 

'I think the pilot did everything he could to slow the aircraft down,' said Port Authority head Patrick J. Foye during a news conference.

I'm not even sure what went through my mind because you're not even sure what's happening,' said passenger Mark Clafter.

'And then it wasn't until the plane came to a stop that all of the sudden you think, 'Holy cow! We just skidded off the runway."'

He added that through it all,, 'no one was screaming, no one was freaking out, and when we came to a dead stop people were actually really calm.'

He said that when they stopped all power went out and the pilot had no way of speaking to the passengers, but even then no one panicked.

One of the passengers, Jamie Primak, who stars on the Bravo reality show Jersey Belle, wrote; 'We just crash landed at LGA. I'm terrified. Please...' 

She later wrote; 'We have all been evacuated. Everyone is safe. Thank you for your prayers. God is good.' 

New York Giants tight end Larry Donnell was also on the plane and shared a photo and video on Instagram as he evacuated on the runway, joking; 'Look at this sh*t! Knew I shoulda stayed my ass at home.' 

He later released a statement saying; 'I feel fine physically and hopefully all the other passengers did not have any significant injuries We were all shocked and alarmed when the plane started to skid, but most importantly, as far as I know, all of the passengers and flight crew were able to exit the plane safely.'

A woman named Vanessa also shared a photo as she left the plane, writing; '#survive #crashlanding #noinjuries.' 

Now some are questioning whether the airport should have even been open during these snowy and icy conditions.

Though the runway had reportedly been plowed shortly before the landing, there were three inches of snow measured near the airport for the day.

One passenger named Steve  stressed just how scary it was inside the plane, writing; 'The pics are deceptive. That is side of runway. We were going in water until hit the hill and spun. #crashland.'

The plane's nose was on the rocks that surround the bay. 

'We came in for landing, the plane hit the ground. As it started to apply the brakes, it started skidding. It didn’t spin around or anything,' passenger Sam Stern told the New York Post.

'It ended up hitting the embankment. The wing broke off.' 

'2 seconds more we would have been in the water!' wrote Jared Faellaci, who posted a photo of the view from his window.

MSNBC thought they had managed to score an interview with Donnell shortly after the crash, but it turned out to be an impostor who said live on air 'F**k her right in the p***y.'
