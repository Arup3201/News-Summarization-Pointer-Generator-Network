An ex Formula One driver, who lost his legs after a horrific crash in 2001, made a sensational return to Brands Hatch yesterday winning a gold medal in Paralympics cycling.

Alex Zanardi, 45, was involved in a high-speed crash during a Champ Car race in Germany in 2001 that sliced his car in two and severed his legs.

Incredibly he survived and began to walk 
again only months after the accident. He returned to motor racing in a 
specially adapted car, later taking up road cycling to stay in shape.

And yesterday he added to his remarkable lifestory by taking gold in the H4 handcycling time trial completing the 16-km former Grand Prix course in 24 minutes, 50.22 seconds.

He finished more than 27 seconds ahead of German Norbert Mosandl, with American Oscar Sanchez taking bronze.

'This is a great accomplishment, one of the greatest of my life,' Zanardi said. 'I worked very hard to get here. It was great to live such an experience at 45.'

‘It’s an amazing feeling, I’m really, really happy for the result,’ Zanardi said. ‘I knew this moment would bring a  little bit of sadness as well. I would lie to you if I said I was happier than two years ago.

'When you choose the right horizon in life and you start to be pushed by your passion, every day is a great opportunity to meet happiness.

‘On Monday I will have to find something different,  otherwise life will become a bit boring. I will give my wife a good week, to relax, to go shopping, to do all the women things, and then back to business.’

Zanardi said he had only ever come second and third at Brands Hatch in a car but revealed Jimmy Vasser, who owns an Indy500 team, had promised him a spot behind the wheel if he won gold.

‘I’ll have to call him back tonight and say, “Hey Jimmy, here I am, I got the gold, how about the car?”’ And that celebration? ‘I’m Alex Zanardi. I have to come up with something at the end of the race. I have a little bit of a big head.’

Zanardi made 45 appearances in Formula One following his debut in 1993 and competed at Brands Hatch when racing in F3000 early in his career, placing second, and then in the World Touring Car Championship later, placing third.

One the day of his accident he was leading the race when he lost 
control of his red Reynard-Honda in the final laps and Canadian driver 
Alex Tagliani ran into him at 220 mph.

He arrived at hospital with just two pints of blood left in his body and had to be resuscitated seven times.

He returned to racing only a year and a half after the crash and continued in the World Touring Car championships until 2009, by which time he had taken up handcycling.

'Three years ago I stopped motor racing, at age 42,' he said.

'It seemed a stupid thing to do to drop everything. It was against all odds. But it's not the first crazy thing I did in life. In the end I was right.

'You should not chase pipedreams, but if you have a horizon to look into, happiness is just around the corner.'

Zanardi was a former track record holder at Brands Hatch in the Formula 3000 category but admitted the circuit was hillier than he remembered.

'With an engine pushing me, I didn't realise it was so hilly. It was very hard, but if I had to design a course, this is what I would have done. It is beautiful, hard ... it suits my charcteristics of an old man,' he said.

'When you are 40, you appreciate what you do every day. I enjoyed every day of training. I've had a magical adventure and this is a fantastic conclusion.'

All the Paralympic road cycling events will take place at Brands Hatch, Kent, 20 miles south east of the Olympic Stadium.

It began as a grass track for cycle racing in 1928. It staged the British F1 Grand Prix for the first time in 1976 and the last time in 1986.
