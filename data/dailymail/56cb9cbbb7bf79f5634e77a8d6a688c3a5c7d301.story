A long list of celebrities including Australian model Elle Macpherson and media tycoon Kerry Packer have become embroiled in a massive tax scandal with a British bank. 

A cache of leaked files shows prominent Australians are among thousands identified as having held secret Swiss accounts with one of the world's largest banks HSBC.

The files, released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, show the Swiss arm of HSBC had almost 500 clients linked to Australia, with 856 accounts, and total combined holdings of about $1.24 billion.

A long list of celebrities including Australian model Elle Macpherson and media tycoon Kerry Packer have become embroiled in a massive tax scandal with a British bank

One client with connections to Australia had accounts worth $A184.21 million.

A string other celebrities have also been caught out in the tax scheme including Genesis frontman Phil Collins, actor Christian Slater, tennis star Marat Safin, former Manchester United footballer Diego Forlan, MotoGP world champion Valentino Rossi and actress Joan Collins.

It it not illegal for Australians to hold Swiss bank accounts, and there is no suggestion any of the individuals have broken the law.

But the report raises concerns about the potential for high net worth individuals to use the highly-secretive Swiss banking system to avoid or minimise tax.

The data in the ICIJ report was secreted away by former HSBC employee Herve Falciani, who turned the information over to the French government in 2008 after which its tax authority launched an investigation.

Australians named include the late media baron Kerry Packer, model Elle MacPherson and former ANZ chairman Charles Goode. There are others with adverse findings against them at the hands of regulators or the courts.

According to the ICIJ report, Mr Packer was the beneficial owner of a client account under the name of C.P. International Management Services Limited, set up in 1994, closed in 2000 and linked to his Consolidated Press media empire.

Mr Packer died in 2005.

Ms MacPherson is listed as a model, entertainer and entrepreneur. The report says Ms MacPherson was connected to seven HSBC client accounts, and was the beneficial owner of five.

'The four client accounts still operative in 2008 were linked to 25 bank accounts that together held as much as $US12.2 million ($A15.73 million) in 2006/2007,' the report said.

In a statement, Ms MacPherson's lawyers say she 'is an Australian citizen who has accounted for UK tax on the basis of full disclosure in accordance with UK law'.

Three of the accounts for which she was the beneficial owner were closed in 2000, 2001 and 2004.

Mr Goode said his account was never used.

International stars including actor Christian Slater (left) and Genesis frontman Phil Collins (right) have also been mentioned in the report 

'There were no deposits (except to open it) and no withdrawals (except to close it),' Mr Goode said in a statement to The Guardian.

International tax avoidance was a key issue at the G20 leaders summit in Brisbane in November with world leaders vowing there would be crackdown.

Treasurer Joe Hockey said then the leaders were 'very determined' to eliminate tax avoidance, particularly by multinational companies.

The leaked files also mentioned actress Joan Collins. International tax avoidance was a key issue at the G20 leaders summit in Brisbane in November with world leaders vowing there would be crackdown

Russian politician and retired tennis player Marat Safin was also named in the document where the HSBC are accused of helping prominent clients evade tax

'Wherever companies engage in extraordinary activity in order to avoid tax, we will go after them,' Mr Hockey said. 

A BBC Panorama investigation which will air in the UK on BBC tonight will investigate the claims further to see how bankers helped clients to avoid taxes.

Offshore accounts are not illegal but they are often used as a way of hiding earnings from HM Revenue and Customs. 

HSBC claims that since the documents were leaked, it has radically overhauled its private banking business and reduced the number of Swiss accounts by almost 70 per cent since 2007.

The man in charge of HSBC at the time, Stephen Green  told Panorama: 'As a matter of principle I will not comment on the business of HSBC past or present.'

The bank now faces criminal investigations in the US, France, Belgium and Argentina. HSBC said it is 'co-operating with relevant authorities. 

Former Manchester United football player Diego Forlan has also become embroiled in the scandal after his name appeared in the leaked documents
