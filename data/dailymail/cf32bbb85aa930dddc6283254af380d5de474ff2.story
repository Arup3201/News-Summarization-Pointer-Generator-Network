John Greig, the man officially recognised as the greatest living Ranger, fell victim to a harsh, brutal truth when the curtain fell on his managerial career.

Greig was — is — a Rangers icon. He captained club and country. He led the Ibrox club to a European trophy *and* holds the record for league appearances, playing 496 games and scoring 120 goals while playing primarily in defence.

He captured three domestic trebles, was Scotland’s Player of the Year twice and received an MBE for services to football in 1977.

Yet, in the end, none of this could protect him from the unsentimental realities of managing Rangers.

Greig won two Scottish Cups and two League Cups. But in October 1983, with Dundee United champions and Aberdeen having triumphed in Europe, he was unceremoniously sacked.

Ally McCoist knows this period of Ibrox history well. A Greig signing, he lived and breathed it. At times his own survival, in the early days at least, was seat-of-the-pants stuff.

McCoist knows more than most that no one – not even the greatest living Ranger – is safe from the sack.

He admitted as much after a 3-1 home defeat to Hibernian last month. That result left Hearts six points clear at the top of the Championship. A gap which has remained stubbornly hard to bridge in the weeks since.

‘I don’t think anyone is bombproof,’ said McCoist then. ‘I wouldn’t sit here for a minute and say I’m bombproof. I’m still wearing the flak jacket but nobody is bombproof.’

For that reason Saturday’s league meeting with Hearts already has the look of a defining day for the current manager.

McCoist would be as close as anyone to Greig in the affections of the fans. But Mike Ashley, the new power on the throne, is no Rangers supporter.

The Ibrox manager already agreed to slash his salary in half but must still subscribe to the Sports Direct ethos. Value for money. Or else.

A Rangers victory would reduce the lead of the Tynecastle club to three points and rank as one of the most important, critical victories of a managerial career which, so far, has been patchy and open to scrutiny.

Former Rangers and Hearts striker Kevin Kyle expressed a commonly-held view when he tipped a doggedly consistent Hearts side, free of off-field strife, to take all three points.

‘The pressure is all on Rangers but I have to fancy Hearts,’ said Kyle. ‘They have shown consistency since the season started. They’re the team full of confidence.’

If he’s right, the margin at the top of the table becomes an awkward nine points. Their finances precarious and predicated on returning to the Premiership as soon as possible, the chances of Rangers doing so at the first time of asking would diminish.

McCoist’s position, bluntly, would come under intense scrutiny. Amidst widespread assumptions Rangers can’t afford to pay off the one-year rolling contract of their manager if they were to dispense with him, a new question would arise. Could they possibly afford to keep him?

McCoist, an eternal optimist, believes he is the man for the job and has been here before. He knows the score.

‘You are only as good as your last pass here,’ he told the club website. ‘I probably know the club better than most and it goes with the territory.

‘The one thing about being a Rangers player and being involved with Rangers is that there is always the next game to make amends for a disappointment.’

The evidence they can do so is patchy. An eight-game run of steady, improving results suggested this was a team turning a corner at the right time.

Yet last weekend’s 1-1 draw with Alloa, a dismal affair, prompted fury in a crowd of almost 30,000. Amidst an ongoing off-field circus, a never-ending procession of furious, arcane statements issued by a cast list of unreliable, largely discredited characters, the level of support has remained a modern marvel.

The people continue to turn up despite a fresh call this week from former director Dave King for supporters to starve out the current board.

Amongst those who do stay away, the football being played is often cited as a factor.

The status of McCoist the player with supporters will never be damaged. In 15 spectacular years, he was top scorer in nine of them. The club’s all-time highest scorer with 355 goals in 581 games, he played through the nine-in-a-row era. But as manager the jury remains out.

His wit and personality makes McCoist a popular figure. Turning on the man does not come easy to supporters. Taking pot shots at Santa would be preferable to some.

‘Ally has a lot of credit in the bank left over from his playing days,’ confirmed Drew Roberton of the Rangers Supporters Association.

‘He left us with an awful lot of great memories and those won’t be erased. But it’s sad that a dream job for him has come along in these circumstances.’

Such circumstances are clear enough. The off-field travails of Rangers are an ongoing soap opera. McCoist has risked criticism for publicly backing the chief executives who have come and gone, lining their pockets en route, but retains a level of gratitude for his actions when the club lurched into administration in 2012.

‘I think, during very difficult times, he has kept the club afloat and he deserves enormous credit for the way he has done that,’ added Roberton.

‘I believe that the vast majority of fans are grateful for the way Ally conducted himself during that period.

‘He steered the club through some difficult years. He was the finger in the dyke at that time.

‘He was left with a club which, for a spell, was a rudderless ship for a few months.’

Reporters who flocked to Murray Park that February week still recall the McCoist’s car shuttling in and out of the training ground’s wrought iron gates for meetings with administrators.

Most football managers, mercifully, will be spared the nonsense he has had to involved himself with. His job description has often gone far beyond standard terms and conditions.

A transfer embargo and dismal finances made free transfers a must. Even so, wages of £7,000 for some top team players in the lower reaches of the SPFL struck many as a poor use of resources.

McCoist justified the cost by setting his sights on taking Rangers back to the top as quickly as possible. Player expense has not been the biggest problem. But there would still be irony in Hearts — another club mired in financial turmoil — beating the Glasgow giants back to the top with a team of kids.

‘With Hearts being six points in front, I think it’s fair to say the game is perhaps more significant to Rangers than it is to them,’ observed Roberton.

For Ally McCoist, a man defined by his Rangers achievements, its significance can hardly be overstated.
