President Vladimir Putin vowed to annihilate all 'terrorists' in Russia, talking tough after two deadly bomb attacks in the southern city of Volgograd that raised security fears ahead of the Winter Olympics.

The uncompromising remarks in a televised New Year address were Putin's first public comments since suicide bombers killed at least 34 people in attacks less than 24 hours apart on a railway station and a trolleybus on Sunday and Monday.

Today Putin travelled to 
Volgograd, where he visited wounded victims in hospital, placed red 
roses at the trolleybus bombing site and held a meeting on 
countertterrorism efforts with senior security officials.

Message: Putin vowed to annihilate all 'terrorists' following two deadly bomb attacks in the southern Russian city of Volgograd that raised security fears ahead of the Winter Olympics

His message came as he visited survivors of the attacks which left dozens of people injured. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attacks

'I am certain that we will fiercely and consistently continue the fight against terrorists until their complete annihilation,' the president said in a New Year's address

The bombings just ahead of Russia's 
biggest annual holiday followed another suicide bus blast in Volgograd 
in October and came little more than a month before the start of Games 
on whose success Putin has staked his personal reputation.

In
 the New Year address, he acknowledged 'problems and serious tests' in 
2013, including the Volgograd bombings, and vowed to ensure security in 
the year ahead.

Putin, 
who came to power when Boris Yeltsin announced his resignation on New 
Year's Eve 14 years ago, won popularity early in his presidency by 
crushing efforts to forge an independent state in Chechnya, but he has 
been unable to stop Chechen and other Islamist militants across the 
North Caucasus.Â

Police 
detained dozens of people in sweeps through Volgograd on Tuesday but 
there was no indication any were linked to the attacks, for which no one
 claimed responsibility.Mourners laid flowers at the site of the bombing that tore the bus apart and left residents fearing further violence.

'I'm
 frightened,' said Tatyana Volchanskaya, a student in Volgograd, 700 km 
(400 miles) northeast of Sochi. She said some friends were afraid to go 
to shops and other crowded places.

Putin
 ordered tighter security nationwide after the blasts, but Russian 
Olympic chief Alexander Zhukov said no additional measures would be 
taken at Sochi: 'As for the Olympic Games, all necessary security 
measures have been foreseen,' Interfax news agency quoted him as saying 
on Monday.

'Additional measures will not be taken in Sochi as a result of the terrorist act. Everything necessary has been done as it is.'

Putin
 has staked his prestige on the Feb. 7-23 Games in Sochi, which lies at 
the Western edge of the Caucasus mountains and within the strip of land 
the insurgents want to carve out of Russia and turn into an Islamic 
state.

Insurgent leader Doku Umarov has urged militants to use 'maximum force' to prevent the Games from going ahead.

Russia drove separatists from power in Chechnya in a war that boosted the popularity of Putin, a former KGB officer.

But
 the insurgency that spread across the North Caucasus region in the 
aftermath of that conflict has persisted despite Putin's repeated, 
strongly worded pledges to eliminate the militants whose attacks have 
cast a shadow over his rule.

As
 prime minister in 1999, he vowed to 'wipe them out in the s***house' 
and in 2010, after female suicide bombers killed 40 people on the Moscow
 metro, he ordered police to find their masters and 'scrape them from 
the bottom of the sewers'.

Less than a year later, in January 2011, a bomber from the North Caucasus killed 37 people at a busy Moscow airport.

The
 rail station bombing in Volgograd was the deadliest attack outside the 
North Caucasus since then, killing 18 people. Citing unnamed sources, 
Interfax said the suspected attacker was an ethnic Russian convert to 
Islam who moved to Dagestan where he joined militants early in 2012.

Investigators said they believed a male suicide bomber was also responsible for Monday's morning rush-hour blast.

Volgograd
 - formerly Stalingrad - is a city of a million and a transport hub for 
an area of southern Russia that includes the North Caucasus.

A
 car bomb killed a prosecutor's assistant in Dagestan on Tuesday and two
 people were killed in a bomb blast there late on Monday, authorities 
said.

In Volgograd, more
 than 5,000 police and interior troops were mobilised in 'Operation 
Anti-terror Whirlwind', Interior Ministry spokesman Andrei Pilipchuk 
said. He said 87 people had been detained after they resisted police or 
could not produce proper ID or registration documents, and that some had
 weapons.

State 
television showed helmeted officers pushing men up against a wall. But 
there was no sign any were linked to the bombings or suspected of 
planning further attacks.

Itar-Tass
 news agency said police were focusing on migrant workers from the 
Caucasus and ex-Soviet states - groups that rights activists say face 
discrimination from police.

The
 success or failure of the Olympics will form a big part of the legacy 
of Putin, 60. He secured the Games for Sochi in 2007, during his first 
stint as president, and has not ruled out seeking a new six-year term in
 2018.

Intended to 
showcase how Russia has changed since the collapse of Soviet communism 
in 1991, the Games have also been a focus for complaints in the West and
 among Russian liberals that Putin has stifled dissent and encouraged 
intolerance.

This month,
 Putin freed jailed opponents including oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky 
and the Pussy Riot punk band in what critics said was an effort to 
disarm Western criticism and improve his image.
