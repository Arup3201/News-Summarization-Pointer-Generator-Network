Costa Rica broadcaster Jale Berahimi is quickly becoming a hit at the World Cup by showing off pictures of her in Brazil, and her latest has been to pose with ex-England defender Rio Ferdinand.

Berahimi took the photo with Ferdinand, who is acting as a BBC pundit in Brazil, ahead of Tuesday's clash between Costa Rica and England.

The two may support different sides in Group D but Ferdinand looked happy enough to strike a pose with the 28-year-old reporter, who posted it on her @JaleBerahimi Twitter page.

Berahimi says she is in Brazil to 'take care of the colour notes of what attracts attention'.

But it is the broadcaster herself who seems to be attracting more by taking to Twitter to post of her snaps while covering the international tournament.

Berahimi, as reported by La Nacion, says: 'I love football. I enjoy it. You never stop learning.

'I see sports and try to learn every day. The channel is preparing, because I have two colleagues who will cover sports, and the World Cup is not only sports, it's also about colour notes and curiosities that catch the eye.'
