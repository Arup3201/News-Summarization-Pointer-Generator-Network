A President Obama-lookalike actor who played the devil in the miniseries 'The Bible' has been edited out of an upcoming film based on the show after the uncanny resemblance sparked intense controversy.

When the 10-hour hit miniseries aired on the History Channel a year ago, bloggers immediately noted the similarities between Satan, played by Mohamen Mehdi Ouazanni, and the President and side-by-side comparisons of the two went viral online.

Eager to avoid rehashing the drama, producers Roma Downey and Mark Burnett decided to leave the character out of their film, called 'Son of God,' which opens on February 28.

Spooky: Scenes with the devil have been cut from the upcoming spin off of The Bible because of the actor, pictured in the miniseries, has an uncanny resemblance to President Barack Obama

'It gives me great pleasure to tell you that the devil is on the cutting-room floor,' Downey told The Hollywood Reporter Monday.

'This is now a movie about Jesus, the son of God, and the devil gets no more screen time.'

The 20th Century Fox film is basically a reshaped version of The Bible. But the miniseries needed to be trimmed from 10-hours to two hours.

Downey said they went out of their way to leave the controversial Satan out of the film.

After the Obama lookalike comments caused a firestorm on the Internet, Burnett, Downey and History each issued statements supporting the president and insisted they never intended to link Obama and Satan.

'Someone made a comment that the actor who played the devil vaguely resembled our president, and suddenly the media went nuts,' Downey told The Hollywood Reporter.

'The next day, when I was sure everyone would only be talking about Jesus, they were talking about Satan instead.'

She added: 'For our movie, Son of God, I wanted all of the focus to be on Jesus. I want his name to be on the lips of everyone who sees this movie, so we cast Satan out.'

The controversial episode of 'The Bible' aired in March 2013 and immediately threw up an awkward coincidence when viewers noticed that Satan bore a remarkable resemblance to Obama.

Twitter exploded during the airing with many pointing out the striking similarities between the 44th President and the devil, played by Ouzaani.

The show was a surprise hit in the ratings, with some episodes of the religious mini-series attracting 13.1 million viewers - topping television leviathan American Idol's 12.8 million viewers.

Right-wing commentator and radio-host Glenn Beck first pointed out the eerie similarity, tweeting, 'Anyone else think the Devil in #TheBible Sunday on History Channel looks exactly like That Guy?'

Others were simply struck by the clear physical match.

 user @Leah Christie, tweeted, 'Oh my word...watching The History 
Channel's The Bible..does Satan look familiar to anyone else?'

While Matthew Gaudet commented, 'Watching The Bible series on the History channel and noticed the guy playing the role of Satan, looks strikingly similar to Obama.'

The unfortunate incident bore comparison with HBO's infamous inclusion of a fake George W. Bush head impaled onto a stick during the background of a Season 1 Game of Thrones episode.

When the Bush incident went viral, the network announced it was pulling the offending episode - from its rotation, freezing shipments of DVD box sets and halting sales on iTunes until the embarrassing blunder had been fixed.

'We were deeply dismayed to see this and find it unacceptable, disrespectful and in very bad taste,' HBO said in a statement.

'We made this clear to the executive producers of the series, who apologized immediately for this careless mistake.'

HBO and the show's creators, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, apologized for the incident.

Benioff and Mr Weiss, who noted the appearance in the series' DVD commentary, insist it wasn't a political statement - just a prop.

The Bible, and now Son of God, retells the stories from the scriptures in a scripted format, from Genesis through to Revelation, the last book of the New Testament.

The miniseries' popularity came as somewhat of a mystery. For one, the drama wasn't a hit with television critics, receiving a mediocre score of 44 on the Metacritic site.

Not again: Producers Mark Burnett and his wife Roma Downey said they cut the scenes featuring the devil to avoid further controversy

'As a cable series, The Bible lacked the ready-made, large scale promotional platform and popular lead-in that can drive strong ratings for a new show on a major broadcast network, of the kind NBC was, for many years,' writes a columnist in The Washington Times.

Indeed, Burnett told Entertainment Weekly that the series' success seemed almost preordained while it was being made.

'The hand of God was on this,' he said in an interview before the show's premiere. 'The edit came together perfectly, the actors came together perfectly, it just comes to life.'

Burnett is most famous for creating reality shows such as Survivor.
