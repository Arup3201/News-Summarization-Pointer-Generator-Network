Jadeveon Clowney, the first overall pick in May’s draft, left the Houston Texans’ season-opener against the Washington Redskins with a knee injury.

Clowney looked distraught as he left the field, but the Texans managed an impressive 17-6 win - ending a 14-game losing streak stretching back to last September.

After his opening NFL game, Texans coach Bill O’Brien was cautiously optimistic, saying: ‘Looks like he’s gonna be OK. He may miss some time, he may not. We don’t know yet.’

Before sustaining the injury in the second quarter, Clowney had one tackle for a loss of nine yards.

In pre-season, Clowney had surgery for a sports hernia in June and missed two weeks after a concussion sustained during a joint practice session with the Denver Broncos last month.

The Texans’ victory owed much to the heroics of an inspired JJ Watt.

Rewarded with with a bumper deal in summer, the All-Pro defensive tackle sacked quarterback Robert Griffin III once, had three tackles (two for loss), a blocked extra point, a batted pass and a fumble recovery.
