Arrested: Maxwell Winkler, 17, has been charged with the murder of a 73-year-old man

A 17-year-old high school student has been arrested for allegedly shooting and stabbing an elderly man to death as he took his daily walk through the park.

Maxwell Winkler was found on his bike in a wooded area in Fishers, Indiana on Monday night as police investigated the brutal killing of Henry Kim, 73. Winkler did not appear to know Kim, police have said.

His body was found in Windermere Park in Fishers at 7pm on Saturday by a dog walker.

He had been shot three times - in the cheek, in the back and in the left upper arm - and also had a deep wound to the front of his neck, the Hamilton County Coroner's Office said, WISHTV reported.

His family said he was likely out on his daily walk when he was attacked, the IndyStar reported. 

After the killing, police released images of a Trek mountain bike and a BMX helmet believed to belong to a potential suspect. A person was seen leaving the park on the bike before Kim's body was found.

On Monday night, Winkler was found riding his bike in the woods when he was stopped on Monday. Police said they do not know what he was doing in the woods at the time.

The teenager cooperated with police and was taken into custody. They executed search warrants at two different locations in Fishers and collected items believed to be related to the crime.

The high school student was arrested around 5am on Tuesday and has now been charged with murder. He will be charged with an adult in the case. 

Wanted: Before his arrest, authorities had released images of a mountain bike owned by a person of interest in the case. When he was found in a wooded area on Monday, Winkler was on his bike, police said

Clues: The person on the bike, who was wearing a helmet like this one, was seen riding from the scene

Detectives do not believe the teenager knew the elderly man or was related to him. They are not searching for anyone else in connection to the crime.

They have not released a motive for the killing. 

On Monday, divers from the Fishers Police Department searched a retention pond in the park, but turned up nothing.

They did find a knife on the grounds of the park but police have not yet confirmed whether it was the one used in the attack.

Winkler is a student at Hamilton Southeastern High School, and detectives said he lives in the neighborhood near Windermere Park, the IndyChannel reported.

Investigation: Police Sergeant Tom Weger said the victim and the suspect did not know each other

Kim was a married father who had lived in Fishers for more than 15 years.

On Sunday, his son Steve, 43, wrote on Facebook: 'I lost my father last night... Feeling sad. He was found dead shot twice in the face in the park. He had no enemies.'

The killing comes just four months after an 18-year-old was stabbed during a party - the first homicide in the area in nearly two decades, police said.

Connor Shockley was killed on June 22 during a gathering in the Harrison Green area and an 18-year-old classmate was charged in his death.
