A disabled former soldier said he felt 'like a dog' after being thrown out of a gastro-pub for trying to sell poppies. 

Patrick Tobin, who left service with a disability pension after fighting in Northern Ireland, was trying to raise money for Royal British Legion when he visited Garden Bar and Grill in Kensington, west London. 

The 76-year-old was about to approach customers when bar staff refused him entry, leaving him 'humiliated'. 

Humiliated: Patrick Tobin said he was made to feel 'like a dog' after being thrown out of the pub in Kensington where he was trying to raise money for the Royal British Legion Poppy Appeal 

'I was going into the garden, he barred my way. He didn't want me to go out there,' the veteran said. 

'He boxed me off and wouldn't let me go down. I'm disgusted about it.' 

Mr Tobin, who has been selling poppies in the area every year for decades, was given no choice but to leave the pub in embarrassment. 

'I was humiliated. I felt like a dog, I was absolutely gobsmacked.' 

Local residents who have seen Mr Tobin collecting on behalf of the charity for years were horrified by the exchange.

Zohra Hussain, who works in a local shop near said: 'It is an important part of life here. They do it every year. It’s bad, we feel bad.

'It is unusual for an area like this.'

One local serviceman who did not want to be named added: 'This is Britain, poppies are part and parcel of Britain. 

'It’s a disgrace.'

Outraged customers have taken to the pub's Facebook page in complaint. 

The pub's manager said the incident was down to a staff member's poor grasp of English and has donated £40 to the charity since

'Most of the families living here had a family member go to war. I hope the company and all the staff have poppies on and make a large donation to the poppy appeal,' Tracey Anthony wrote.  

John Mitchell added: 'Shame on you. One of your staff has put shame on your company. 

'Poppies are a part of UK heritage, and your company is in the UK so your staff should have respect.'  

Bardi Berisha, the bar's manager, put the incident down to staff members' poor grasp of English. 

'To be clear the Garden bar has always proudly supported the poppy appeal every year and this year in no different.

'If Mr Poppy man would like to return, I will personally buy all his poppies,' he said. Mr Berisha added he had donated £40 to Royal British Legion since the incident.
