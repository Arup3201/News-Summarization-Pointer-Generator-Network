Worry: Tory MP Ben Wallace said intelligence and security agencies were covered by laws in place to protect citizens against unwarranted intrusion

Google, Facebook and other private companies pose a greater risk to data privacy than State snooping, Parliament was told yesterday.

Internet giants are ‘harvesting’ personal data and making billions of pounds a year, but are not properly regulated, an MP said.

Former military intelligence officer Ben Wallace - now a Tory MP - said security and intelligence agencies were covered by strict laws in place to protect citizens against unwarranted intrusion.

By contrast, lax protections against private snooping allowed mass collection of internet activities by private firms.

Mr Wallace, a former platoon commander and military intelligence officer in Northern Ireland, said such companies needed tougher regulation because of the greater risk they posed to personal data.

His comments came as MPs debated the actions of former US National Security Agency employee Edward Snowden who stole vast numbers of top secret files and leaked them to newspapers.

Many of his revelations were published by the Guardian newspaper which has faced accusations it undermined national security.

The leaking of the documents was criticised by the head of MI5 for handing a ‘gift’ to terrorists.

The debate was brought by Liberal Democrat, Tory and Labour MPs who warned about the scale of State surveillance exposed by Snowden’s revelations.

Julian Huppert said the country was sleepwalking into a surveillance state and called for new scrutiny of security agencies such as GCHQ.

But Mr Wallace told MPs the real threat to privacy was from private companies.

He said: ‘Privately, without being a member of the security service or a government, I can find out where every one of you in this room shops, I can find out where you live, I can find out where you bought your car, I can find out your credit rating, I can probably get hold of everybody’s details without very much effort.

‘But what I find interesting is I’ve not yet heard one criticism or fear or demand that we regulate the private sector.

‘The big capitalist companies in America - the Googles, the Facebooks - harvest our data without your leave, sell it on to intermediaries on and on and on.

‘They make millions, billions of pounds, avoid tax - I haven’t yet heard anyone saying how they all keep their servers offshore to avoid tax - and that’s the area that needs regulating and protection.’

‘I’m proud that our security services are regulated. I’d rather have the state than the private sector all over the world grooming through my internet capabilities...’

Google has faced repeated questions about its privacy protections and data-gathering activities. It has faced accusations it is creating a data goldmine at the expense of unwitting users.

Its Street View cars took pictures of 
every street in Britain and at the same time collected vast swathes of 
personal data from open wi-fi networks in people’s homes and offices.

The company has claimed that the collection was a ‘mistake’ but an investigation by US regulators found that a company software engineer explicitly designed the Street View programmes to collect the data and warned his bosses repeatedly about privacy implications.

Mr Wallace said The Guardian was yet to produce evidence that British spies are breaking the law.

He pointed to legal controls on data collection by the State contained within the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 - which is known as Ripa.

He said his former intelligence colleagues ‘hated’ Ripa because it forced them to register how they used their powers and provided essential oversight and accountability.

Cambridge MP Mr Huppert said the ‘mass hovering up of information using new technology’ was, he said ‘chipping away at our own liberty and our own privacy’.
