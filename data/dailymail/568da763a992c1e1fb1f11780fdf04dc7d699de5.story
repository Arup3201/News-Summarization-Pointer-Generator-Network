A private US company,  on track to become the first commercial visitor to the International Space Station, has delayed its spaceship's launch date by at least a week.

Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, was scheduled to launch the supply ship next Monday but officials have announced that the spaceship needs more testing.

The Dragon spacecraft will be first private ship to go to the station but now its lift-off is likely to be around May 7 rather than the planned date of April 30 after NASA did a final review of the mission on Monday.

Necessary: NASA is counting on the private companies to keep the space station stocked with supplies and science experiments following the retirement of the space shuttles last year

‘Am pushing launch back approx a week 
to do more testing on Dragon docking code' SpaceX founder and CEO Elon 
Musk wrote on Twitter. 'New date pending coordination with @NASA.'

The Dragon will be hoisted aboard the 
company's Falcon rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida. NASA loaded the 
test flight with non-essential cargo of clothing, food, computers and 
science equipment.

SpaceX has successfully launched the 
Falcon and Dragon before, but going to the space station requires more 
proven precision. NASA is turning to private companies to carry cargo 
and eventually astronauts to the space station.

NASA had been confident that the SpaceX mission would be able to go ahead on the scheduled date.

So far, NASA has invested $381 million in the SpaceX rocket and cargo capsule, with the company and investors contributing about another $700 million, SpaceX founder and Chief Executive Elon Musk said.

The Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule also are in the running to serve as a space taxi for astronauts. The United States hopes to break Russia's monopoly on flying crews to the station, a service that cost more than $60 million per person, by 2016 under a related NASA program.

'This is a test flight and we may not succeed on getting all the way to the space station,' Musk said. 'I think we've got a pretty good shot, but it's important to acknowledge that a lot can go wrong. This is pretty tricky.'

If the launch is successful, the Dragon capsule would conduct a series of maneuvers and tests in orbit before NASA clears it for approach and berthing at the station. It would remain attached to the outpost for several weeks before flying back to Earth and splashing down in the Pacific Ocean for recovery.

The capsule will carry 1,149 pounds (521 kg) of food and non-critical equipment and supplies to the station. It is expected to return 1,455 pounds (660 kg) of cargo back to Earth, a capability that far exceeds what the Russian Soyuz capsules can hold.

The European and Japanese ships that also fly cargo to the station incinerate in the atmosphere after making deliveries and do not return to Earth.
