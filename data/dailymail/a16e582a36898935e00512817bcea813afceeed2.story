Tens of thousands of curious visitors have crowded historic Mont Saint-Michel and other beauty spots along the French coastline with the promise of a ‘tide of the century’, but it may not have lived up to everyone's expectations.

Anticipating a wall of water that could equal the height of a four-storey building, tourists and locals staked out positions around the picturesque landmark last night and again today, including the partially-washed out causeway as the tide retreated.

They travelled to France’s northern coast for the first giant tide of the millennium, with experts predicting that it could reach as high as 46ft - 18ft above normal - thanks to the effects from yesterday’s spectacular solar eclipse.

Tens of thousands of people are visiting the Atlantic coastline in France, including Mont Saint-Michel, for the 'supertide'

Tidal specialist Nicolas Pouvreau told French media that the surge was a few inches short of expectations

French officials said the supertide would be a major opportunity for tourism in Brittany, including the walled port city of Saint-Malo

But tidal specialist Nicolas Pouvreau told France 24 the surge was a few inches short of expectations.

Mont Saint-Michel was briefly turned into an island at high tide, but low tide provided an opportunity for people to walk on the expansive flat seabed. 

Although it is dubbed the ‘tide of the century’, the ‘supertide’ phenomenon occurs once every 18 years when a rare alignment of the sun, moon and Earth create a massive gravitational pull on the sea.

On each occasion, Mont Saint-Michel provides a stunning setting for those looking to watch the phenomenon.

In nearby Saint-Malo, France, spectators were soaked by large waves which crashed over the crowded waterfront.

Experts said the last 'tide of the century' occurred on March 10, 1997 and people will have to wait until March 2033 for the next one

This morning's high tide was close to peak levels as the sea rushed in from over eight miles out, but calm weather diminished the risk of flooding and let down some of the visitors who travelled from afar.

Tourist Jean-Bernard Delamarche, who visited Saint-Malo, said: 'For the "tide of the century" I am a bit disappointed. We came one year, we were staying at the hotel Ibis and we could not get out of the hotel because the street was flooded. But it's true that it is impressive.'

US student Noah Feingold added: 'It's almost more spectacular at low tide in the end because you will be able to walk kilometres and see some little secret beaches that will only be revealed at this moment.'

High tides triggered by the eclipse saw water flooding over the banks of the River Thames today as alerts remained in place for parts of the UK. 

The Thames Barrier has closed for the 175th time today in its 30 year lifespan, the first operational closure of 2015 and the first of the 2014 to 2015 winter season.  

As the moment of high tide approached, the river flooded on to the path in Barrier Gardens. Flood alerts were also issued for parts of Teddington and Twickenham.

High tides were reported in Greenwich, Putney Embankment, Chiswick Mall and Strand-on-the Green in Chiswick.

France kicked off nearly a month of exceptionally large spring tides, as people flocked to coastal areas for the so-called 'tide of the century'

While it is a massive tourist draw the exceptionally high spring tide caused some anxious moments for people who live near the sea.

Parts of the coast are on high alert and people have been urged not to venture out too far during the 'supertide'.

Officials at France's Navy Oceanic and Hydrological Service (SHOM) warned that the tide ‘will come in faster than a running man’.

Michael Dodds, director of the regional tourism committee, said: 'This natural phenomenon is an incredible opportunity for tourism in Brittany at this time of year.'

Similar tides are expected along the coasts of Britain and the Netherlands, and at the Bay of Fundy in Canada. The largest tidal ranges in the world occur in Canada at the Bay of Fundy and Ungava Bay where tides can reach 55ft in height, according to Canadian officials.

The last 'tide of the century' occurred on March 10, 1997 and the next will take place in March 2033.
