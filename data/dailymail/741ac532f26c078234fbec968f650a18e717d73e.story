Mexico coach Miguel Herrera just can't keep his joy bottled up, and his enthusiasm has made him one of the most entertaining and popular figures of the World Cup and an internet sensation worldwide. 

Memes of Herrera flood the web. One shows his hair catching on fire cartoon-style. In another he playfully sticks out his tongue while photobombing three members of his team on the pitch.

In a video, he dances happily to Spanish ska music.

Forget, for a moment at least, Herrera's success in turning around the troubled Mexican team, to face Holland in the last-16 on Sunday.

Football fans around the globe have fallen in love with the man's colourful antics and pulsation towards his country, which are often as absorbing as the goals flying in.

'He is so authentic, so expressive and so genuine,' said Enrique Krauze, a Mexican historian and World Cup commentator.

'He's becoming the representation of the Mexicans' ability to celebrate and party. That is very seductive.'

Although he wears a suit and a tie, Herrera rumbles up and down the sidelines like a classic Mexican wrestler.

When his players score, he shakes his arms in the air and seemingly goes into a state of euphoria, throwing his short, stout body up and down the sidelines.

He jumps atop one player like a friendly puppy, carries another team member in his arms like a proud father or simply kneels down on the sideline, face up, eyes closed, ecstatic. 

During the World Cup, sportscasters have affectionately compared Herrera to a cartoon monster - Tweety Bird's version of Mr. Hyde, from an animated short by Warner Bros.

There is unquestionably a humorous resemblance, right down to the shock of sandy hair. And he's not afraid of ruffling his side up.

'If a player can’t go one month or 20 days without having sexual relations, then they are not prepared to be a professional player,' he told the Mexican newspaper Reforma.

'So then we will not be looking for sex or having sex at the World Cup just to have it, we are going to go after what we came for, a competition that gives us the opportunity to rise above and do something really great.'

Herrera's theatrical gestures are not new to Mexican fans who followed him through his two years as a coach for Mexico City's America soccer club.

But his 
performances on the pitch during the World Cup have won new admirers for
 the man known as 'Piojo', or louse, since he played for Mexico's 
professional Atlante team. 

'Piojo
 is the way he is and there's no way he is going to change. I am happy 
they are talking a lot about him,' said Mexico's captain Rafael Marquez.

Herrera
 has more followers on Twitter than other coaches - 735,000 - and often 
posts selfies to his official account; a favourite is a June 15 snap 
with a legion of Mexico fans in the background.

'You generally don't hear a lot about the coaches,' said Jesus Berumen, 59, a Mexican fan in Los Angeles.

'He spreads happiness. He's so natural in the way he does things.'

Herrera's 
overly enthusiastic nature hasn't always attracted positive attention. 
As a player, he was on the precipice of making the Mexican team for the 
1994 World Cup in America, but was scratched after he wildly tackled a 
Honduras player during a qualifying match. He still insists he doesn't 
know why he didn't make the team.

There was also the occasion he called the Bosnia team 'dirty pigs' after losing a recent friendly and has defending fans chanting of a gay slur while an opposing goalkeeper takes a goal kick, claiming it's 'not that bad'.

His
 coaching career began in 2002, but it wasn't until nine years later 
that he really made his name, leading the under-performing America side 
to the Mexican league championship last year, and earning a reputation 
for turning teams around. 

Herrera was chosen as an interim solution last autumn when little hope remained for Mexico qualifying for the World Cup.

'He
 revived the team and the country,' said Hector Diaz, 27, a Mexico fan 
on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, sporting a Mexican jersey and 
enormous green sombrero.

'He lives soccer as if he were there on the field playing.

'It's easy for fans to identify with his enthusiasm.'

That's true the world over.
