Princess Beatrice has been  earning $30,000 a year while working as an intern at Sony, according to information leaked after the company was hacked.

Among the data released last week, which included Brad Pitt's phone number, were the pay details of around 6,000 of the company's staff.

One staff member is listed as 'York, Beatrice', which is thought to be a reference to the Princess who the daughter of Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and is sixth in line to the throne.

Her job title is listed as intermediate production coordinator, and her home address is recorded as being Windsor, Berkshire.

Princess Beatrice, pictured at this summer's Epsom Derby, is being paid $30,000 a year (£19,500) to work as an intern at Sony, according to pay information released by hackers last week

Beatrice has been working as an intern at Sony Pictures since the beginning of the year after quitting her job at an investment capital firm and following a period travelling around the globe with her boyfriend

The start date released by the hackers also seems to match up with when Beatrice was reported to have began working for the company at the beginning of the year.

A spokesman for the Palace refused to comment on the data, saying only that Princess Beatrice works in the business sector. The Times reported that she remains employed by Sony Pictures.

During the hack last Monday, sensitive medical files, email exchanges, pay details and other private information about staff were stolen. 

Princess Beatrice, who is the sixth in line to the throne, took up an internship at Sony Pictures at the beginning of the year. 

Although Beatrice has an HRH title she does not receive taxpayers' money.

She does however undertake royal engagements on behalf of her grandmother the Queen from time to time, as she is keen to do her public service.

She quit her job at investment capital firm Cabot Square Capital near Marble Arch last Summer and then travelled the world with her boyfriend Dave Clark.

She was spotted aboard the yacht of billionaire steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal in St Barts and also went to Aspen, America's chicest ski resort.

Since returning to London, she has been working at the Sony Pictures Television at its London headquarters in Golden Square.  

Stars who have allegedly been hacked include actor Sylvester Stallone, best known for playing Rocky Balboa

The hacking group calling itself Guardians of Peace began its attack last Monday, putting almost every one of the film studio's computers out of action. 

Some reports said several computers of Sony employees displayed a picture of a skeleton, threatening to release large amounts of data from the company.

The latest revelations suggest that 47,000 Social Security numbers have been leaked.

This allegedly includes stars such as  director Judd Apatow and actors Rebel Wilson and Sylvester Stallone. The leaked numbers belong to both past and current employees. 

Sony workers saw a message appear on computer screens saying 'Hacked by #GOP' - understood to be the initials of a group called Guardians of Peace which has been linked to North Korea

This comes in the wake of the salaries of Michael Lynton, the CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment and Amy Pascal, the co-chairman of the company, being published. Both were revealed to be making a $3million annual salary. 

The hackers also uploaded five yet-to-be-released films to file-sharing websites, including the Brad Pitt film Fury, still in cinemas, and Annie, the much-anticipated remake set for a December 19 release. 

The early leak of films is considered, by the film industry, to have a devastating effect on the potential success of a title. 

The company has been trying to take the videos off the internet with cease-and-desist orders.

The files infiltrated by the hackers included a script for an unreleased pilot written by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan as well as 'email exchanges with employees regarding specific medical treatments they are undergoing, while one disciplinary letter details a manager's romantic relationship and business travel history with a subordinate.'

The leaked information even includes an email about the breastfeeding diet of a senior executive.

Pay information for more than 31,000 employees at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd, a financial firm hired by Sony, were taken in the hack as well.

Sources close to the internal investigation of the hack at Sony say they believe a North Korean group is behind the attack. Officials in North Korea previously threatened action

The suggested motivation for a hack from North Korea, commentators said, had been the country's anger at an upcoming Sony film, The Interview.

In the film, set for release at Christmas, Seth Rogen and James Franco play two reporters who have been granted an audience with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.

The CIA then enlists the pair to assassinate him.

North Korea said the film was 'the most undisguised sponsoring of terrorism as well as a war action'.

The country's UN envoy Ja Song-Nam said there would be a 'merciless response' if the film was not cancelled.

However, the diplomat quoted by Voice of America - who asked to remain anonymous - dismissed reports his country had been involved in the attack on Sony.

'Linking [North Korea] to the Sony hacking is another fabrication targeting the country,' he told the broadcaster. 

'My country publicly declared that it would follow international norms banning hacking and piracy.'

Earlier this week, a separate North Korean official gave a more ambiguous response, saying: 'Wait and see,' in response to a question about the attack.

Sony has yet to officially name North Korea as the source of the cyber attack, but sources close to the internal investigation spoke out yesterday to say they believe a group known as DarkSeoul is to blame.
