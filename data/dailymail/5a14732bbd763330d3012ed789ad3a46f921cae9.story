Floyd Mayweather allegedly riled up his rapper friend Earl Hayes over his wife's infidelity before Hayes gunned her down in the bathtub and then killed himself, according to a new report. 

TMZ claims that the champion boxer told his rapper friend over iPhone FaceTime Monday morning that he was 'weak' for not leaving Stephanie Mosley after she allegedly cheated on him with a fellow rapper.

Citing anonymous sources, TMZ says that Mayweather was still on FaceTime when Hayes left to get a gun.

Mayweather has responded to the tragedy by sitting courtside at NBA games two nights in a row. On Monday night - just hours after the shooting Mayweather was seen with a female companion at a the Los Angeles Clippers-Phoenix Suns game at the Staples Center.

Then, on Tuesday night he was spotted again - this time grinning and chatting on the phone - with girlfriend Liza Hernandez at the Los Angeles Lakers-Sacremento Kings game.  

Realizing that his friend was out of control, Mayweather pleaded for Hayes to calm down and stop what he was doing.  

According to a source who spoke to TMZ, '[Mayweather] was pleading with him to get a grip ... to no avail.'

The source added that Mayweather will not say how much he saw, but he acknowledges he was a witness and heard everything.

A message MailOnline left with Mayweather's publicist was not immediately returned.  

While the prize fighter was still on the phone, Hayes allegedly went into the bathroom and fired 10 to 12 shots at his wife, who was taking a bath.

Mayweather was out and about Monday evening just hours after he reportedly witnessed - or at least heard - the gruesome murder-suicide. 

The champion boxer was photographed as he attended the Los Angeles Clippers and Phoenix Suns basketball game Monday night.

Hayes claimed Mosley had allegedly had an affair years earlier, and though Hayes and Moseley reconciled, he is said to have never gotten over her infidelity.

Songz took to Twitter shortly after the tragedy, writing; 'R.I.P babygirl. Once an angel on earth, now watching over us from Heaven. You'll b missed but never forgotten. Love.'

Police rushed to the couple's apartment early Monday morning after there were reports of gunshots and a woman screaming.

A SWAT team was eventually forced to break down the door, and found the door to one of the bedrooms locked.

They then heard two gunshots, and when they entered found both Hayes and Moseley dead.

Brown also posted a tribute to Moseley on his Instagram Monday, writing; 'RIP baby girl. Danced with me on tour and was always the coolest person. My prayers go out to you and HAZE family.' 

He later took the post down. 

Today it was revealed Hayes  recorded a song called Suicide about killing a girlfriend, according to TMZ.

Lines included: 'I could just kill us both, go out with a smash. 

'F*** the real life shoot it out and do your time on the spot. 

'Make a family crying with your girl and their hearstses.'
