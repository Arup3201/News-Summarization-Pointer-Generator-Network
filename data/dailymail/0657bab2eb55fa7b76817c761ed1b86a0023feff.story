Hundreds of thousands of people could lose access to the internet by July following a hackers' scam - and they don't even know it.

Unknown
to most of them, their problem began when international hackers ran an 
online advertising scam to take control of infected computers around the
world.

In a highly unusual response, the FBI 
set up a safety net months ago using government computers to prevent 
Internet disruptions for those infected users. But that system is to be 
shut down.

Connection timebomb: Most victims don't even know their computers have been infected, although the malicious software probably has slowed their web surfing and disabled their antivirus software, making their machines more vulnerable to other problems

Infected: It is estimated that a network of about 570,000 computers was targeted by hackers

Now, the FBI is encouraging users to visit a website run by its security partner
that will inform them whether they're infected and explain how to fix 
the problem. After July 9, infected users won't be able to connect to 
the Internet.

Most victims don't even know their 
computers have been infected, although the malicious software probably 
has slowed their web surfing and disabled their antivirus software, 
making their machines more vulnerable to other problems. 

Last
November, the FBI and other authorities were preparing to take down a 
hacker ring that had been running an Internet ad scam on a massive 
network of infected computers.

Tom Grasso, an FBI supervisory special 
agent, said: 'We started to realise that we might have a little bit of a
problem on our hands because ... if we just pulled the plug on their 
criminal infrastructure and threw everybody in jail, the victims of this
were going to be without Internet service.

'The average user would open up Internet Explorer and get `page not found' and think the Internet is broken.'

On the night of the arrests, the agency brought in Paul Vixie, chairman and founder of Internet Systems Consortium, to install two Internet servers to take the place of the truckload of impounded rogue servers that infected computers were using.

Federal officials planned to keep their servers online until March, giving everyone opportunity to clean their computers. But it wasn't enough time. A federal judge in New York extended the deadline until July.

Grasso added: 'The full court press is on to get people to address this problem.'

Hackers infected a network of probably more than 570,000 computers worldwide.

The number of victims is hard to 
pinpoint, but the FBI believes that on the day of the arrests, at least 
568,000 unique Internet addresses were using the rogue servers.

Five 
months later, FBI estimates that the number is down to at least 360,000.

The U.S. has the most,
about 85,000, federal authorities said.

Other countries with more than 
20,000 each include Italy, India, England and Germany. Smaller numbers 
are online in Spain, France, Canada, China and Mexico.

Vixie
said most of the victims are probably individual home users, rather 
than corporations that have technology staffs who routinely check the 
computers.

They took advantage of vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Windows operating system to install malicious software on the victim computers. This turned off antivirus updates and changed the way the computers reconcile website addresses behind the scenes on the Internet's domain name system.

The DNS system is a network of servers that translates a web address - such as www.ap.org - into the numerical addresses that computers use. Victim computers were reprogrammed to use rogue DNS servers owned by the attackers. This allowed the attackers to redirect computers to fraudulent versions of any website.

The hackers earned profits from advertisements that appeared on websites that victims were tricked into visiting.

The scam netted the hackers at least $14 million, according to the FBI. It also made thousands of computers reliant on the rogue servers for their Internet browsing.

When the FBI and others arrested six Estonians last November, the agency replaced the rogue servers with Vixie's clean ones. Installing and running the two substitute servers for eight months is costing the federal government about $87,000.

FBI officials said they had taken the
unusual step of organising a system to avoid any appearance of 
government intrusion into the Internet or private computers. And while 
this is the first time the FBI used it, it won't be the last.

Eric Strom, the FBI's Cyber Division unit chief, said: 'This is the future of what we will be doing.

'Until there is a change in legal system, both inside and outside the United States, to get up to speed with the cyber problem, we will have to go down these paths, trail-blazing if you will, on these types of investigations.'

Now, he said, every time the agency gets near the end of a cyber case, 'we get to the point where we say, how are we going to do this, how are we going to clean the system' without creating a bigger mess than before.
