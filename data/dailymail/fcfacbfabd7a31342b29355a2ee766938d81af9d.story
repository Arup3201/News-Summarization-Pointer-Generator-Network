Struck off: Fadi Sukaria joked he could cure a nurse’s intimate medical condition with his ‘magic tongue’

A Syrian dentist who joked he could cure a nurse’s intimate medical condition with his ‘magic tongue’ has been struck off.

Fadi Sukaria repeatedly groped his colleague, made sexually explicit comments to her and asked if she had any ‘rude’ pictures or videos on her phone.

When he heard she was suffering from cystitis, Sukaria said: ‘I have a magic tongue to make it better.’ 

His disturbing comments were made while the pair were working together at the Gateway Dental Practice in Barnsley, the General Dental Council (GDC) heard.

Sukaria also asked the woman, referred to as Nurse A, if she had ever been raped before stroking her breasts, groping her bottom and biting her arm, the hearing was told.

Saba Naqshbandia, for the GDC, said they were working together on November 28 2012, when they chatted about going to the gym.

‘During this Sukaria stroked her bottom very lightly and said it was "nice". The complainant responded by saying: "Don’t ever touch my bum".

‘He stroked her breast saying: "I will touch these instead". She recalled that he was laughing.’ 

‘She had to lean next to him, but not over him, to use the computer - as she used the mouse he stroked her right breast again.

‘He grabbed her right arm with his teeth and mouth and sucked it. She said "how dare you do that" and he laughed.

‘Later he said: "I wonder what your bum feels like with jeans on" and tried to put his hands on her.

‘She recalls being very scared and wondering what he was going to do, by now the complainant was very upset and shocked.’

When she asked another member of staff for a lift home in the evening Sukaria asked if she had ever been raped and added: ‘I’ve never raped anyone.’

The next day she did not attend work, saying she felt unwell.

Sukaria also showed another dental nurse - Nurse B - pictures of a woman’s bottom on his phone, saying: ‘Look at that bum, it’s really nice bum.’

He also thrust his groin while laughing, the hearing was told.

Giving evidence, Nurse B said: ‘It was a picture of a lady bending over wearing black trousers. He said "that’s a really nice one to get a hold of," and simulated her straddling him with a leg either side. 

‘I think he was a bit filthy minded. I don’t think he thought there was anything wrong with what he did even though it was inappropriate.’ 

Sukaria denied all the allegations against him and fellow dentist Dr Fulya Arda told the hearing: ‘Fadi is a very nice person, he is very trustworthy - I have known him for ten years.

‘I was very surprised by the allegations. When I read them first I just laughed - there is no way Fadi would do things like this. There is no way I believe them. Sorry.’

Sukaria is the sole breadwinner for his family in Syria as his brother was injured and left paralysed after a bombing, the hearing was told. 

GDC panel chair Mary Harley said: ‘The committee takes a particularly serious view of your conduct because it took place in a professional setting.

‘Your behaviour towards Dental Nurse A escalated over a short period of time into you deliberately touching her bottom and her breasts and sucking and or biting her arm on 28 November 2012.

‘This escalation continued despite Dental Nurse A making it clear to you that your conduct was unacceptable. 

‘Both Dental Nurse A and Dental Nurse B described you laughing during the course of these incidents. 

‘As a dentist working directly with these dental nurses, you were in a position of authority over them; you abused that position for your own sexual gratification.

‘Your conduct would be considered deplorable by members of the dental profession and indeed by members of the public.’

Sukaria, of Eastgate, Leeds, was found to have committed a number of offences including making inappropriate and sexual comments and inappropriately touching a nurse.

He also inappropriately showed a nurse sexual pictures on his phone.
