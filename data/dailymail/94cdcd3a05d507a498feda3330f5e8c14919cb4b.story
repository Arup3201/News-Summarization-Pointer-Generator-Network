The Grand Canyon Regional Communications Centre received a report of a man falling off the rim at about 8am Saturday.

An investigation into the incident is being conducted by the National Park Service and the Coconino County Medical Examiner.

According to NBC 5, Anderson had worked as an insurance agent with State Farm Insurance since 1985.

He also had his own agency in Bedford, and according to its biography, he was a graduate of Purdue University.

According to reports, there have been some 685 deaths recorded so far at the Grand Canyon.

In March 2012, newlywed Ioana Hociota, 24, was just 80 miles short of becoming the youngest person in history to hike the Grand Canyon from end to end when she fell 300ft to her death.

It was believed at the time that a loose rock may have caused the fall.
