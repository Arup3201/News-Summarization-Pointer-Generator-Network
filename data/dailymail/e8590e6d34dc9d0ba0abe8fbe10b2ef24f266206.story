The parents of a teenager who was stabbed to death after allegedly meeting a stranger on the internet buried their son today on what would have been his 15th birthday.

Breck Bednar was attacked in Grays, Essex, 30 miles from his home after travelling to meet a man he knew online, it has been claimed.

The church-going teenager - who was said to be addicted to online computer games - travelled by train to the flat of an 18-year-old stranger who it is believed he played with over the internet.

Hours later the boy was pronounced dead at a flat in Grays after paramedics tried to revive him.

Today his parents, oil millionaire Barry Bednar, 49, from Houston, Texas, and U.S.-born teaching assistant Lorin LaFave, 47, attended their son's funeral service near their family home at St John the Evangelist Church in Surrey.

Hundreds of mourners joined the funeral procession for the teenager who was a member of the Air Cadets with the 135 Squadron in Redhill. His mother carried his cadet beret.

Breck's parents, who live in a £600,000 house in Caterham, Surrey, with their three children, said in a family statement: 'Today we should have been celebrating our son Breck's 15th birthday.

'Instead we are burying him after his life was cut so tragically short.

'The amazing number of people attending his service is a tribute to Breck's outgoing nature, both at school and amongst his wider circle of friends.

'This turnout is no surprise to us as he has always been a sociable and good-natured child and, as our eldest, at the heart of our family.

'In his honour, we have established a charitable foundation, the Breck Bednar Foundation.

'We urge anyone with an interest in helping young people safely use the Internet to become involved in this important cause.

'Meanwhile, we are thankful for the overwhelming support we have received from all of Breck's friends, relatives, and our community during these dreadful days.

'It is comforting to know that he was so loved by so many people.'

Mr Bednar works for investment firm Tandem Partners and also owns a £1million flat in Canary Wharf.

Chris Curtis, headteacher of St Bede's School, in Redhill, Surrey, where Breck was a pupil, said they had been devastated by the 'awful news' of the Year 10 pupil's death.
