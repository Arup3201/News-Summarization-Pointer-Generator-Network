Japan's Prime Minister Naoto Kan has stepped down after barely 15 months in office.

Kan's announcement comes after his approval ratings plunged over his handling of the country's nuclear crisis that followed the earthquake off Japan in March.

In a nationally televised speech, Kan said he was stepping down as chief of the ruling Democratic Party.

He said he will officially quit as prime minister after the ruling party votes to pick a new leader on Monday.

The winner will become the country's sixth prime minister in five years.

Japan has been plagued by high turnover in political leadership at a time when the country faces huge problems.

The country is suffering from an aging 
population, bulging debt and a stagnant economy - and now reconstruction
from the worst disaster to hit the country since World War Two.

Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda and Trade Minister Banri Kaieda are also seen as contenders.

The decision was widely expected because
in June, Kan had promised to quit once lawmakers passed three key 
pieces of legislation, the final two of which cleared the parliament 
earlier today.

Kan managed to survive only a few months longer than the four previous prime ministers, who each lasted a year or less.

Looking back on his year and three months in office, Kan said he did all he could given difficulties he faced, including the disasters and a major election defeat in upper house elections last summer that left the parliament in gridlock.

'Under the severe circumstances, I feel I've done everything that I had to do,' he said.

'Now I would like to see you choose someone respectable as a new prime minister.'

The 64-year-old Kan has seen his approval ratings tumble below 20 per cent amid a perceived lack of leadership after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, which led to meltdowns at three reactors at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant.

Only 10 per cent of respondents approved of Kan's job performance, while 69 percent disapproved, in an AP-GfK poll conducted between July 29 and August 10.

Some 21 per cent said they neither approved or disapproved. The poll's margin of error was 3.8 per cent.

Survivors have complained about slow recovery efforts, and radiation has spread into the air, water and some foods.

Radiation leaking from the plant has declined dramatically as workers try to bring the plant to a cold shutdown by January.

Many of the 100,000 people who were evacuated from around the plant live in temporary housing or shelter, and have no idea when they will be able to return to their homes.

Accumulated radiation in some locations may keep them away for a long time, government officials have said recently.

Political commentators say Kan was at least partly undone by persistent political infighting, including within his own party.

While the public hungered for political cooperation and vision in the wake of the crisis, parliamentary sessions frequently descended into squabbling matches that have disillusioned the public.

It was a no-confidence motion in June submitted by an opposition bloc that prompted Kan in June to promise he would resign in a desperate attempt to keep his own party members from joining the vote.

In the wake of the crisis, Kan urged Japan to become less reliant on nuclear energy, but his appeal did little to boost his image.

At an evening press conference, Kan said that the atomic crisis made him realize that having so many nuclear power plants in quake-prone Japan 'could endanger the people's future'.

Contenders will officially declare their candidacy on Saturday, followed by a debate on Sunday and party vote on Monday. The new Cabinet is expected to be installed on Tuesday.

Japan will remove soil, plants, trees and cleaning roofs of buildings in an area spanning thousands of square miles in a bid to halve radiation in places contaminated by the Fukushima nuclear crisis.

The cleanup could cost tens of billions of dollars, and thousands of evacuees may not be able to return home for years, if ever.

Radiation in a contaminated area is estimated to fall naturally by about 40 per cent over two years, and the government wants to speed up the process by another 10 per cent through human efforts.

Yesterday it was revealed the amount of radioactive caesium-137 released by the plant so far is estimated to be equal to that of 168 Hiroshima bombs.

Government nuclear experts, however, said the World War II bomb blast and the accidental reactor meltdowns at Fukushima, which has seen ongoing radiation leaks but no deaths so far, were beyond comparison.

Today, nuclear crisis minister Goshi Hosono said: 'We aim to reduce radiation levels by half over the next two years in affected areas, and by 60 per cent over the same period for places used by children.'

Kan urged the Democrats to seek unity as they pick a new leader. A key player in the process remains party kingpin Ichiro Ozawa, who still wields enormous influence even though he lost to Kan in the party leadership election last September.

'I hope to see this party become one, where everyone from the young to the veterans can discuss policy actively and freely, then cooperate and act as one,' Kan said.

Kan, who called off a planned trip to visit President Barack Obama next month due to the political uncertainty, said Tokyo should keep Japan-U.S. alliance as a 'cornerstone' of its security and foreign policy.

He also urged his successor to 'not put off any longer' attempts to rein in Japan's public debt, which has grown to more than twice the size of the country's gross domestic product.

The idea of raising the country's five per cent sales tax as a way to address this problem and raise money for reconstruction efforts seems to have lost traction.
