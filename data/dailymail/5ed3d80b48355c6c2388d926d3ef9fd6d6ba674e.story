Researchers have discovered a new species of fish that breathes air and has evolved to grow extra strong scaly skin that can withstand piranha bites.

The fish is a new species of arapaima, a giant freshwater fish native to the Amazon River in Brazil and has been named A. leptosome.

In the mid-19th century, four species of arapaima were officially recognised but in 1868, Albert Günther, a scientist at the British Museum of Natural History, published an article that suggested that all sub-species should be classified as the same species: Arapaima gigas.

The scientist's views eventually became the commonly accepted classification.

Researchers have discovered the scales of the freshwater Arapaima gigas are made up of stacked spiral staircase-like layers covered in collagen, protected by an outer shell. This image shows the latest species of arapaima, called leptosome, that has only just been officially classified

The Arapaima gigas is a species of fish found in the Amazon River basin in Brazil.

They are the largest freshwater fish in South America and can grow to around 6ft 7in, although many peak at around 6ft long.   

The fish has large black and green scales with red markings.

It is known locally as 'paiche', which means 'red fish'.

The new fish, dubbed Arapaima 
leptosome, has several distinguishing features, including an elongated 
sensory cavity on the head, a sheath that covers part of the dorsal fin 
and distinctive markings on its skin.

Although it was first discovered back in 2001, it has taken this long for the fish to be officially classified.

The discovery and subsequent classification means there are now five known species of arapaima.

The most recent species was found where the Brazilian Solimoes and Purus rivers join.

However the latest findings called this view into question.

The most recent species was found where the Brazilian Solimoes and Purus rivers join.

'Everybody for 160 years had been saying there’s only one kind of arapaima. But we know now there are various species, including some not previously recognised,' said Dr. Donald Stewart of the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, who made the discovery.

In separate research, experts have also studied the scales of the fish and discovered they consist of stacked spiral staircase-like layers made of collagen, protected by a hard outer shell.

These spiral layers intertwine and curve inward and outward meaning they can repel the force of the piranha's tiny sharp teeth - and researchers believe the scales have evolved in this way.

The team from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory wanted to know how the fish evolved to live in relative peace with the flesh-eating predators.

They studied the scales to the highest resolution microscopic level ever used in experiments of this kind and discovered each individual scale is made up of a series of layers.

A single scale has a hard outer shell, around 0.5mm thick, on top of a soft inner core that is double the thickness of its protective layer.

The scales of the arapaima, pictured at microscopic levels, overlap each other by about 60 per cent. Each scale has a 0.5mm hard outer shell on top of a soft 1mm inner core. The core is made up of elastic collagen and researchers believe the fish evolved this way to protect itself

The core is made up of elastic collagen shaped by multiple staircase-like structures that curve in and around each other.

The outer shell can protect the fish 
from initial contact from the bite, but if the teeth shatter the brittle
casing, the softer core has evolved to repel the force of the bite.

To test the scales, researchers simulated piranha bites along the row to see how the teeth penetrated them. 

They found the scales overlap each other by about 60 per cent and this adds an extra layer of protection because a piranha tooth is able to break one scale, but rarely two.

Study co-author Bernd Gludovatz from the laboratory told Live Science: 'The beauty of the structure is when you apply a load in a certain direction, the spiral stairs have the ability to rotate, and can modify the loads you have applied to the entire sample to withstand the loads.'

'We want to understand how 
nature develops these materials, and then try to copy them and make 
something similar and, if possible, get the mechanical properties maybe 
even better and more efficient.'

The findings are published in journal Nature Communications.

Piranhas, such as the one pictured, are omnivorous meaning they eat plants and meat. They are indigenous to the Amazon River basin and live alongside the arapaima fish. Researchers believe the fish's scales have evolved to repel the force of the piranha's tiny sharp teeth
