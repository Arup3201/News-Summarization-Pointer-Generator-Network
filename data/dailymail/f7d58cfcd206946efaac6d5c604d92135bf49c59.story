'The interest in it has surprised me immensely. We’ve had some pretty good product launches in the past but this pretty much takes the cake,' Mr Witehira said.  

According to Stuff.co.nz, one chocolate-milk fiend took every Lewis Road Creamy Fresh Chocolate Milk on display at Auckland's New World Victoria Park. 

The store was forced to limit the number of bottles to two per customer.

'That's his right to do that, but we have to be fair to everybody,' Mr Witehira said. 

On Facebook Lewis Road Creamery responded to the phenomenal response, asking consumers to be patient.

The craze have caused confused people commenting on social media about the hype from chocolate-milk crazed crowds

'Hi Roadies, we’re literally overwhelmed by the response we’ve received to our Chocolate Milk - we had no idea demand would be so great. However, we are not a big corporate with endless machinery and deep pockets. We are a small independent and passionate New Zealand company that’s just finding its feet and believes Kiwis deserve the best dairy produce. We’ve been right so far with our butters and milk and cream, and wildly right with Chocolate Milk.

Our equipment is running at full capacity and we are working around the clock to produce as much Chocolate Milk as we can. We do hope we will be able to source additional equipment to increase supply but it takes time and we won’t do anything that compromises the quality of our product.So bear with us New Zealand as we strive to improve our supply. Lewis Road Creamery Fresh Chocolate Milk is here to stay so if you can’t find some on your next shop, we’re making it six days a week and there will be more soon,' Lewis Road Creamery wrote on Facebook.

Lewis Road Creamery have decided to reward their obsessed chocolate drinkers, giving away four bottles of chocolate milk to customers in a competition. 

Even the black market is trying to cash in on the chocolate-milk phenomenon

Online site Trademe have users bidding from $1-$25 for the bottles - and they are selling

But the chocolate-milk craze is not only swirling through New Zealand supermarkets. 

Even the black market is trying to cash in on the chocolate-milk phenomenon, as online site Trademe have users bidding from $1-$25 for the bottles. 

On Friday fake bottles of Lewis Road Creamy Fresh Chocolate Milk emerged on Facebook, in hope to target those desperately seeking out the chocolate-milk bottles.

An image of a bottle without Whittaker's trademark logo was posted on social media, forcing suppliers to express concerns, according to 3News.co.nz. 

'[We] love the fact Kiwis are using their ingenuity to make their own versions of our milk at home, with a block of Whittaker's and a bottle of Lewis Road Creamery milk,' spokeswoman Angela Weeks said. 

'However, we don't support people making and selling counterfeit versions of our product, as this could be a potential health risk to consumers.'  

Seems like these milk-thirsty Kiwis are finding any  possible way to get a hit of the creamy chocolate bottled drink.
