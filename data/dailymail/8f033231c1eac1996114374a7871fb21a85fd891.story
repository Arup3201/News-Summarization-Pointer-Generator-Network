Swansea City are considering a move for Blackburn striker Rudy Gestede. 

The 26-year-old Benin international is valued at £6m by the Championship side and so far no club has matched their valuation.

Palace had a £3.5m offer rejected over a week ago.

Swansea target Rudy Gestede scores the winning goal for Blackburn in FA Cup clash

Blackburn Rovers came from behind to beat nine-man Swansea City 3-1 in their FA Cup fourth round clash

Manager Gary Bowyer admitted Gestede could leave after beating the Welsh club in the FA Cup.

‘It would be a huge blow, of course it would,’ he said. ‘Personally, we have to try and keep all our players in this window. But if they were to go I’m sensible enough. I’ve been brought up the right way to not throw my toys out of the pram and get on with it.

‘That is all I can do. If they were to get sold I would go out and find the next one.

‘Gareth Bale went to Real Madrid, Ronaldo goes to Real Madrid. Eventually it seems to happen to every player these days. All you do is dust yourself down, wish them all the best and crack on.

‘I would obviously put my opinion forward but at the end of the day the owners of the club are there to make the financial decisions. 

Gestede helped Blackburn reach the fifth round of the FA Cup, but may not be at the club to play that game
