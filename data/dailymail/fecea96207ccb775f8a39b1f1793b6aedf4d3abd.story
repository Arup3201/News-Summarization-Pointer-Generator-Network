Just weeks before he died of cyanide poisoning after winning a $1 million lottery jackpot, a Chicago businessman signed a deal to pass his share of several dry cleaning stores solely to his wife in the event of his death, the widow's lawyer has revealed.

News of the unusual agreement has further fueled the fighting amongst Urooj Khan's relatives over his estate, once estimated at $2 million.

Though Khan's wife Shabana 
Ansari is not under formal investigation by police, the dead 
millionaire's relatives are extremely suspicious that the victim's 
younger wife may have had a role in the 46-year-old's death.

Meraj Khan, a sister of the deceased, has said her suspicions about Ansari have intensified since learning about the usual business agreement.

‘Things are getting more clear about why my brother is gone,’ she told The Chicago Tribune. ‘Out of nowhere she's the beneficiary for … the business?’

Ansari has been questioned by Chicago police detectives over her husband's death, but denies any wrongdoing and hasn't been accused of any crime.

Under the terms of the contract, Ansari owns half the dry cleaning operation and real estate, valued at more than $1 million, instead of those assets being divided amongst heirs in probate court, according to her lawyer, Al-Haroon Husain.

Questions: Urooj's sister, Meraj Khan and brother, ImTiaz have both spoken publically of their suspicions about what role Shabana Ansari played in her husband's dead

He admitted the contract was unusual.

‘I just think he wanted to make sure his wife had a business and had attachment to the commercial property if something happened to him,' Husain told the Chicago Tribune.

Khan died without leaving a will, but in 2007 had also signed a real estate agreement with his wife entitling her to sole ownership of their half a million dollar home.

If those assets are not included, Khan's estate is worth only about $680,000, including the $425,000 in lottery winnings, according to documents filed Thursday by Husain.

When a final value for the estate is determined, it will likely be split evenly between Ansari and Khan's 17-year-old 
daughter from a previous marriage Jasmeen.

Khan died last July, the 
day after collecting an over-sized check from Illinois State Lottery 
officials at the 7-Eleven near his Chicago home where he bought the 
winning scratchcard.

After taxes, the prize money amounted to $425,000 as he took it in a lump sum.

Homicide: Khan, 46, died in July a day after collecting his $425,000 lottery winnings

The
initial toxicology report did not show up cyanide so the death was 
ruled as by natural causes. It was only when his older brother ImTiaz Khan intervened that the 
poison was found by further tests.

Since then the final meal that Urooj, 46, consumed has become central to the case.

Shabana Ansari prepared her husband's
last meal but didn't eat it, saying she was a vegetarian and couldn't 
eat the meat in it. Her father, Fareedun Ansari, also didn't consume the
meal, saying he was on a diet and neither did Jasmeen.

Khan's body was exhumed last month for further testing before it was buried again.

Authorities had called 
for the exhumation of his body to take samples of flesh, which could 
provide valuable clues into the man’s mysterious death.

Family members are hoping the autopsy will shed some light on Khan’s murder. The 
results of the tests are expected later this month.

Two weeks ago Khan's older brother 
Imtiaz spoke publicly of his suspicions that family members may have 
been involved in Urooj's death.

The body of Urooj Khan was exhumed last month for a forensic autopsy by the Cook County Medical Examiners office in Chicago

'Shabana said Urooj had no enemies,' he continued. 'That’s because they were in the house. She was his enemy No. 1.'

Imtiaz Khan said he remembers seeing 
Fareedun Ansari pacing back and forth on the day his brother won the 
lottery saying 'That lottery ticket was mine.'

He says Shabana Ansari then tried to comfort him, saying 'Don't worry, Baba [father]. It will be yours.'

Khan had come to the U.S. from Hyderabad, India, in 1989, setting up several dry-cleaning 
businesses and buying into some real-estate investments.

Despite having foresworn gambling after a pilgrimage to Mecca in 2010, Khan bought a ticket in June.

He jumped 'two feet in the air' and shouted, 'I hit a million', he recalled at a lottery ceremony later that month.

He
said winning the lottery meant everything to him and that he planned to
use his winnings to pay off mortgages, expand his business and donate 
to St Jude's Children's Research Hospital.

Anger:
Urooj's siblings said they had compiled a 47-page dossier on everyone 
who knew him - including his wife, Shabana Ansari, right, adding it was 
'impossible' that his death was natural

He was just days from receiving his winnings when he died before dawn on July 20.

With
no outward sign of trauma, authorities initially determined Khan had 
died of natural causes. But a concerned relative - whose identity 
remains a mystery - came forward with suspicions and asked authorities 
to take a closer look.

Further
toxicology tests found a lethal amount of cyanide in his blood, leading
the medical examiner in November to reclassify the death a homicide.

Another element was added to this already-complicated family drama last month when Khan's ex-wife spoke 
out to reveal that she had only learned their teenage daughter 
was living in the U.S. after finding out her former husband was dead.

Back in the day: The last time that Maria Jones saw her daughter Jasmeen was in 2000 when she and Urooj Khan divorced

One state away: Khan told Jones he was 
taking their daughter to India, then after his death she discovered the girl had been living in Illinois all the time

Maria Jones said she thought that Khan had taken their 
daughter Jasmeen to live in India after their acrimonious split but only
found out that Jasmeen lives in Illinois when she saw footage of Khan 
accepting his giant lottery check.

'I was thinking "Oh my God! My daughter!"' Jones said, who lives one 
state away in Indiana. She says she was too poor to afford a lawyer at 
the time so was unable to contest custody.

Mrs
Jones - formerly Maria Rabadan - met Mr Khan in Chicago where they 
worked together. They got married in 1991 but they divorced in 1997.

She
said that she later reached out to Mr Khan's relatives and was told 
that he had left the U.S. for India with Jasmeen and did not plan to come 
back.
