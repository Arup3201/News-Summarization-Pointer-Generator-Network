The leader of Unite, Britain's biggest union, is facing an investigation into claims his election included the balloting 160,000 'phantom' members.

Voting papers were also sent to some dead former members in the election of Unite's general secretary Len McCluskey, his opponents allege.

Jerry Hicks, who lost the election to Mr McCluskey, in April, this year, has called for the election to be re-run.

Unite's general secretary Len McCluskey is facing a probe into claims his election included the balloting of 160,000 'phantom members' including some who had died

He said 158,000 ballot papers were sent to members no longer paying fees between December last year and January this year.

According to Mr Hicks, the Unite union
return for December 31, 2012, was 1,346,414 members with up-to-state 
addresses on the union's system.

However, 140,000 people more than that were balloted.

The Certification Office, which regulates unions, has launched an investigation into the claims, according to The Sunday Times.

Mr Hicks is being represented by barrister Jody Atkinson, who previously succeeded getting a re-run a UCATT election. 

Mr Atkinson said: 'It appeared that Unite
had been balloting people who had left the union, most likely because 
they had not paid their subscriptions.

'And it seems that ballot papers 
have been sent to people who have not been members for years.'

Mr Hicks received almost 80,000 votes, while Mr McCluskey won 144,570.

The claims comes after accusations of attempted vote rigging by Unite in the safe Labour seat of Falkirk (pictured)

He said he wants Unite's leadership 'to explain why people who weren't members of the Unite union could vote in the election of its General Secretary. So far I've been offered no explanation.'

Mr Hicks added in a statement on his website: 'The leadership got arrogant about their own power. They are paid six figure sums and have lost touch with ordinary members.'

Unite deny any ballots were sent out to ineligible members.

A spokesman for the union said the members Mr Hicks refers to 'were in arrears' and therefore allowed to vote.

A Unite spokesman said: 'Mr Hicks has already been given a response on this matter by the independent Electoral Reform Services, which acted as Returning Officer for the General Secretary election.

'The members referred to were in arrears and under rule entitled to vote in the General Secretary election.  Because they are in arrears they are not included in Unite’s declared membership figures.

'Unite is fully confident that this was a proper decision, that the election was conducted with integrity and in full conformity with the law, and that the outcome cannot be called into question.

Unite has been accused of signing up members to the Labour Party if they were likely to vote for the union's candidate Karie Murphy (pictured)

'It is regrettable that Mr Hicks should seek to do so – however, Unite will cooperate fully with any inquires the Certification Officer may choose to make on the basis of his complaint.'

It is the latest controversy to emerge involving Mr McCluskey and Unite in recent days.

He has become embroiled in accusations Unite tried to rig the parliamentary selection process in the safe Labour seat of Falkirk.

Unite, which has given Labour £8million since the last General Election, were accused of trying to rig the selection process for a parliamentary candidate but were cleared by the Labour Party in September.

The union was accused of coercing members to join the Falkirk Labour Party and some people said they were signed up without their knowledge.

The Sunday Times today published emails it says suggest Unite activists broke rules about the selection process.

It claims Unite signed up members to the Labour Party and paid for their first year of membership if they were likely to vote for the union's candidate Karie Murphy.
