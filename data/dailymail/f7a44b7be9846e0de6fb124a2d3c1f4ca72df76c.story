A woman has lost an incredible ten stone after she became so fat that she broke her sofa.

Christine Drane, 53, from Scunthorpe, ballooned to a size 28 after years of overeating and snacking on treats and chocolate.

But she was finally spurred into action when she slumped on the sofa after a long day and the springs gave way under her 24st frame.

Christine Drane, 53, from Scunthorpe, weighed 24st (left) after gorging on junk food for years. She finally managed to lose 10st after starting the 80/20 diet, which allows treats 20 per cent of the time. She currently weighs 14st (right) and is on track to reach her final goal of 11st

Christine was so determined to do something about her weight that she turned down the chance to get a gastric band fitted and opted to shed to flab the hard way instead. 

The customer care worker tried everything from juice diets to calorie counting and managed to get her weight down to 20st, but then she hit a wall. 

It was only when she sought help from weight loss expert Steve Miller, after seeing him on Sky's Fat Families, that she finally mastered a weight loss regime.

Christine has now lost more than ten stone by following an 80/20 regime. 

The three-meal-a-day plan allows the dieter to indulge in their favourite treats 20 per cent of the time, so long as they eat healthily for the remaining 80 per cent.  

Christine tried every diet under the sun, but never managed to lose much weight 

Christine currently weighs 14st and is well on track to reach her final goal of 11st.

She said: 'For as long as I can remember, I've always been overweight. 

'My husband and I have been married for 33 years and I have literally been on a diet for the whole time. 

'There is no diet that anyone can name that I haven't tried.

'Occasionally, I would drop a few stone here and there but it would just pile back on. 

'I mean, If weighing 20st was after weight loss then that's saying something!'

Since losing 10 stone, Christine now enjoys wearing fitted dresses and has started to wear make-up again 

Christine continued: 'I remember meeting with my GP when he told me about gastric band surgery and I was absolutely mortified.'

'I remember thinking I would rather die from being fat than have surgery - it's just something I would never even contemplate.

'The first time I met with Steve, he told me I was really fat and it was what I needed to hear.

'He has never let me make excuses and always encouraged me to do more, I never thought I would be able to lose so much weight and keep it off.

'I've started wearing make-up again and I'm always receiving lovely compliments.'
