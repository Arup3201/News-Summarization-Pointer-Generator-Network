One of London's largest penthouses has come up for sale with a staggering £8.9million price tag - because the flat is five times bigger than the average semi-detached house.

The four-bedroom apartment overlooking the Thames on the South Bank boasts two private balcony terraces, looking out over the city's skyline.

It is spread over three floors, with 4,600 sq ft of space - compared to 925 sq ft for the typical new-build family home with three bedrooms.

Pricey: This penthouse, believed to be London's largest, has gone on the market with a price tag of £8.9million

Balcony: The property has two private terraces which overlook the London skyline, including sights such as St Paul's Cathedral

Airy: The flat's windows extend from floor to ceiling to help its residents make the most of the view

The astronomical price tag for the penthouse is explained by its location in Benbow House, right on the banks of the Thames.

Among the popular attractions which are within a few minutes' walk of the building are the Globe theatre, Tate Modern and the Southbank Centre arts complex.

The flat's interior features include floor-to-ceiling glass windows - allowing the owner to take full advantage of the view over London - a wood-panelled study and a library installed in an upstairs gallery.

As well as the four double bedrooms, kitchen and dining room, and family room, it benefits from two underground parking spaces and a 24-hour concierge service.

Formal: A dining room separate to the kitchen will enable the property's new owner to host dinner parties overlooking the Thames 

Bedroom: The sleeping areas are built into the roof of the building in a loft conversion style

The South Bank area has become increasingly fashionable after decades of being considered relatively shabby compared to the City of London and the West End, on the other side of the Thames.

The Globe, a reconstruction of Shakespeare's 17th-century theatre, was opened in 1997, while the Tate Modern followed in 2000 after the renovation of the former Bankside Power Station.

The Southbank Centre, which includes the National Theatre, British Film Institute and Royal Festival Hall, is another highlight of the area, and Borough Market is considered one of the top destinations for the capital's foodies.

Study: The wood-panelled office area opens up onto a second, smaller balcony for when the owner needs a break from work

Open: The dining room and drawing room areas have no walls to try and create a light, airy feel to the penthouse

Modernist: The bathroom uses a minimalist style to create an up-to-date aesthetic

A spokesman for Pastor Real Estate, which is selling the penthouse, said: 'This is a fantastic apartment in one of the most vibrant locations in central London, with breathtaking views of the London skyline and river.

'It is very centrally located, in the heart of a unique location that offers so much and is rapidly becoming one of the most sought-after locations in London.

'The location, space, light and parking mean that the Penthouse at Benbow House appeals to both those working in the City and the arts. It would make a stunning home or City "pied-a-terre" and is also great for entertaining in all seasons.'

Kitchen: Despite the lack of a wine cellar in the rooftop flat, there is a fridge specifically dedicated to keeping bottles at optimum temperatures

Sleek: Another bedroom is fitted out with wooden floors and walls to create a modern but naturalistic style

View: The gallery, which includes the library, looks down over the main living area

The market for ultra-luxury property in London has been booming over the past few years following an influx of wealthy buyers from places such as Russia, China and the Middle East.

Prices across the capital has risen by more than 10 per cent in the past year, although they are now falling slightly as the market shows signs of slowing down.

Last year, a penthouse flat in One Hyde Park in Knightsbridge was sold for £140million even though it had not been fully constructed.
