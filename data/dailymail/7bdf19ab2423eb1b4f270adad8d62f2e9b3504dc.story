It is likely that Jordan Henderson will captain Liverpool when Steven Gerrard leaves at the end of this season. A tunnel tear-up with Diego Costa has been advanced as evidence of his new-found steel.

‘If he becomes captain he will carry it with great honour,’ said Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers. He is certainly much improved, yet Henderson is sorely lacking a quality that can never be taken for granted.

He has three goals this season. Gerrard, in his comparative dotage, has nine. Henderson has just 16 goals in his entire Liverpool career, dating back to 2011. In that same period, Gerrard has 42.

Both are central midfielders, both regarded as leaders within the group. Yet time and again, Gerrard has used his position and influence to conjure a vital result for his club. Henderson is yet to prove he can do that.

Saturday’s draw with Bolton Wanderers was another example. Gerrard was rested, Liverpool drew a blank. Nobody filled his shoes, certainly not Henderson.

Let’s face it, Liverpool wouldn’t even have made it this far without Gerrard. Had Rodgers rested him against AFC Wimbledon, they would probably have fallen at the first. When Gerrard is on the pitch, one always feels Liverpool have a chance.

Gerrard scored twice as Liverpool defeated Wimbledon in the third round of the FA Cup earlier this month

Anyone can have a row with Diego Costa. If we don’t hear about too many tunnel confrontations involving Gerrard it is probably because we are too busy celebrating his brilliance on the pitch, or one of his match-winning goals.

Gerrard’s captaincy is about so much more than pulling on an armband.

He leads by example, but also by deed.
