A British tourist was killed in a horror car crash involving an alleged stolen car within an hour of arriving in Australia today.

Scientist Sean Barrett, 36, died when the taxi he was in was hit by the alleged stolen car which ignored a red traffic light, it was claimed.

He and his 28-year-old cab driver, named as Kuldeep Singh, were killed in the crash as the taxi was making its way into Perth at 2am after the tourist's plane had landed at the city's airport.

Tragic crash: Sean Barrett, 36, was in a taxi heading towards the city of Perth when the car was hit by a stolen 4x4

Police said Mr Barrett, a doctor of quantum physics and worked at Imperial College London, would have been in Australia for little more than an hour when he was killed.

It is understood he was due to speak at a conference on Tuesday.

His family paid tribute to him, issuing a statement which said: 'Sean was a brilliant mind, and a brilliant man.

'Anyone who had the pleasure to meet him in physics and beyond would tell you that.

'He was a charismatic man who had the rare gift to light up any room.

'He is a loss to science, and to life.

'He was cut short in his prime.

'Rightly, his family, friends and his colleagues whom he leaves behind are devastated.

'We would appreciate the time and space to grieve Sean's passing.'

The taxi was hit by the stolen four wheel drive at high speed while a police helicopter kept observation on it.

The
PerthNow website said it understood the Briton was a physics doctor who
had planned to two spend two weeks in Perth while attending a 
conference.

Police patrol 
cars had originally chased the stolen Toyota FJ Cruiser, which had no 
lights on, but dropped back when they decided the pursuit was too 
dangerous.

The 23-year-old driver of the four wheel drive, who suffered a broken leg in the crash, which occurred at a road junction, has been interviewed in a Perth hospital by Major Crash Unit investigators.

He was later charged with two counts of manslaughter.

Assistant police Commissioner Gary Budge said the 28-year-old taxi driver, who is of Indian descent, had collected the Briton from the airport and had been driving along the Leach Highway towards the city when the stolen Toyota allegedly ran a red light and smashed at speed into the taxi.

He said the police aborted the chase 'a long, long way from where the crash occurred.'

It is understood a police helicopter was till monitoring the driver and that the crew on the helicopter filmed the crash.

Mr Budge expressed his condolences to the families of the Briton and the taxi driver.

'I want to tell them that we will provide all the support that is possible to both of them.'
