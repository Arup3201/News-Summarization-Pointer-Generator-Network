Britons pay higher property taxes than any other country in the developed world, forking out around £60billion a year, a report reveals today. 

Charges like stamp duty, council tax, capital gains tax, inheritance tax and business rates are higher in the UK than any of the 33 other members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). 

The taxes are worth 4.1 per cent of Britain’s economic output, compared to an average of 1.8 per cent across the OECD. In Germany, it is only 0.9 per cent.

A report compiled by think-tank Policy Exchange has found Britons pay higher property taxes than any other country in the developed world

Alex Morton, of the think-tank Policy Exchange, which compiled the report, said: ‘No other developed country taxes property more heavily than the UK.

‘Yet rising house prices and falling levels of home ownership have led to many calling for an increase to land and property taxes.

‘But these issues will only be solved by genuine reform of the outdated planning system, not a tax raid on people’s homes.’

The report also criticised the Lib Dem proposal for a ‘mansion tax’ on properties worth more than £2million – as it would penalise those who live in ‘small but valuable homes’.

The report is calling for radical moves to 'make it easier for people to buy their own home' with a massive increase in the number of homes built every year in Britain

It adds: ‘Some people paying will not have an income that in any way relates to the value of their property and capacity to pay the tax.’

There is a ‘strong case’ to cut back stamp duty to ‘a low and reasonably small tax’, which has been repeatedly increased by both Labour and the Conservatives since 1997.

By 2018, stamp duty could be worth a record-breaking £9.4billion a year, according to the latest forecast from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility.

Stamp duty used to be charged at one 
per cent on all homes bought for more than £60,000. Today it is levied 
at five different rates of up to seven per cent.

But
has rejected any proposals for changes to the controversial tax system.
Reducing stamp duty cannot be ‘the first priority’ at a time when money
is tight, it said.

Concerns: The Council of Mortgage Lenders yesterday raised its fears about the Government's new Help to Buy scheme

The report is calling for radical moves to ‘make it easier for people to buy their own home’ with a massive increase in the number of homes built every year in Britain, including garden cities.

Policy Exchange, co-founded by the planning minister Nick Boles before he became a Tory MP, says 1.5million new homes should be built by 2020, equal to 300,000 a year from 2015.

At present, just 110,000 homes are being built every year, far below the number that are needed to keep up with people living longer, couples divorcing and immigrants needing a place to live.

A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: ‘The Chancellor has been clear there are no plans for a new house price tax on family homes.’

The Council of Mortgage Lenders yesterday raised its fears about the Government’s new Help to Buy scheme.
