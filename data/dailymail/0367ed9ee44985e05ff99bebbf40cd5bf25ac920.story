Report: Jamie Gustafson filed a police report after she claims a Jason's Deli employee was taking photos of her as she breastfed her two-month-old son

A Texas mother filed a police report after she caught a restaurant employee taking pictures of her while she breastfed her baby Thursday, authorities say.

Jamie Gustafson, of San Antonio, sat in Jason's Deli and was breastfeeding her two-month-old son when she discovered an employee taking photos of her,USA Today reports. 

'I was stunned,' Gustafson told KENS 5 Eyewitness News. 'I was speechless... I wanted to take his phone and smash it.'  

Gustafson told KENS 5 that she never had any issues nursing her son in public up until the incident. She said that her sister confronted the employee and told management, who responded quickly.

The owners of the restaurant told KENS that the employee has been fired.

In a statement released by the company, officials described the employee's conduct as 'an explicit breach of written company policy' and a 'violation of the values we care about deeply.' 

The statement also decribed the company's support of the right of woman to breastfeed their children. 

Though the employee has since been fired,She Knows magazine reports that his termination came only after some profanity-laden Facebook posts were written by the employee.  

Gustafson told KENS that she is not upset with the company, but may not feel as comfortable as she breastfeeds in public in the future.
