Do you love watching The Only Way is Essex, Jeremy Kyle and The Great British Bake Off but hate admitting it? Don't worry, you're not alone.

A new study has found many of us have programmes which we regularly sit down to enjoy - but prefer to keep our guilty pleasure to ourselves.

The latest adventures of Joey Essex, Sam Faiers and Lucy Mecklenburgh on TOWIE came top of the pile, while Jeremy Kyle’s show and The Great British Bake Off came second and third respectively in the poll.

The Only Way really IS Essex! A new study has revealed that Brits love watching TOWIE but hate to admit it

The study revealed that while many may be quick to insist they are avid viewers of high-brow programmes like Newsnight, it's actually the antics of the TOWIE cast and lure of conflict and emotional drama of Jeremy Kyle that have viewers hooked.

Other guilty pleasures include tea-time drama Hollyoaks and Strictly Come Dancing.

Brits are also keeping their love of Storage Hunters secured tightly as the show where treasure seekers bid on garages full of junk made the top ten.

The report found that the average TV viewer clocks up over 25 hours of television in an average week - more than 1,266 hours a year - which may explain why over a third said they love nothing more than a night in front of the box.

The study also saw Downton Abbey voted the most popular programme in recent times by the average British viewer.

Dr Helen Wheatley of the University of Warwick said: 'This report shows the versatility of TV as a medium.

'The research shows that people continue to turn to television for entertainment, to learn new things, to become absorbed in the twisting plot lines of a television drama, but also to indulge in "guilty pleasures".

'It is clear that whilst viewers simultaneously find a wide range of programmes fascinating and compelling, they also worry about what their viewing habits say about them.'

According to the report, white van men harbour the biggest flame for baking goddess Mary Berry but keep tight lipped about it in front of their friends.

Glee is the unexpected favourite of bankers, insurers and accountants with 19 per cent of them admitting to tuning in regularly in search of light relief from the stresses of the city, while hairdressers love Strictly Come Dancing.

Tristia Harrison of TalkTalk, who 
carried out the survey, said: 'Whether it’s gathering the family 
together to watch your favourite 
programme, or tuning into your guilty pleasure to escape from the 
outside world, it’s clear to see that TV is at the heart of British 
homes.

'It’d be boring if we 
all like the same shows; the key is finding TV that complements your 
viewing style and watching it your way.'
