Iain Duncan Smith told the Commons that Brussels is seeking to unpick Britain's existing deterrents to benefit tourism

Britain will ‘utterly refuse’ to water down rules on benefit claims by EU immigrants - and is winning support from other countries for tighter regulation, ministers said yesterday. 

The Government is embroiled in a deepening row with the European Commission over so-called ‘benefit tourism’, with bureaucrats in Brussels saying there is no evidence people are attracted to the UK by its welfare system.

It says the rules will only be looked at if Britain could show evidence of ‘systematic, widespread abuse of benefits by EU migrants’.

But France has joined Germany in 
indicating that it favours a tightening of the rights attached to 
freedom of movement across the Continent, sources suggest.

Work
and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith told the Commons that Brussels
is seeking to unpick Britain’s existing deterrents to benefit tourism.

‘Our own assessment – our habitual 
residency test – currently prevents people who could be working and not 
on benefits from claiming those benefits. It is the Commission that is 
trying to get us to change that, and I am utterly refusing to do so,’ he
said.

Downing Street said there was ‘widespread and understandable concern’  over people coming to the UK and  being able to access benefits. But in an extraordinary attack on the Coalition, the Commission said it had been asking for figures on the extent of benefit tourism in the UK for three years but the  Government had consistently failed to produce them.

Spokesman Jonathan Todd said ‘one can but sincerely hope’ for ministers to set the record straight.

‘The vast majority of migrants go to the UK to work, and they actually contribute more to the welfare system than they take out, purely because they tend to be younger than the average population, and of working age,’ Mr Todd told the BBC’s Daily Politics programme.

‘The more EU migrants you have, the better off your welfare system is.’

The Commission insisted its own report showing there are more than 600,000 ‘non-active’ EU migrants in the UK did not provide enough evidence for them to act, since the figure included older schoolchildren, students, the spouses of migrant workers, and retired people.

Only around 38,000 EU migrants in the UK are claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance, it added. The report also disclosed that the number of EU migrants coming to Britain without a job increased by 73 per cent in the three years to 2011.

A spokesman for the Work and Pensions department said: ‘It is absolutely right that we have strict rules in place to protect the integrity of the British benefits system and make sure it is not abused.

‘That is why we are pressing ahead with strengthening the habitual residence test and time-limiting how long some migrants can claim benefits.

‘We are also determined to fight court action by the European Commission who want to challenge a key part of our safeguards to ensure that benefits are only paid to people who are legally allowed to live in Britain.’ 

The Government is embroiled in a deepening row with the European Commission over 'benefit tourism'

The department said that as of February this year, more than 5.6million people were claiming working age benefits. Of these 397,000 – 7 per cent – are estimated to have been non-UK nationals when they first registered for  welfare. This is an increase of more than 100,000 since 2008, when the figure was 288,720.

Prime Minister David Cameron’s official spokesman said: ‘There is an issue around access to the welfare system, around fairness as well as a cost issue. We don’t think the current system is working, that is why we are looking at changes across the board.’

As well as examining benefit rights, the Government is currently conducting an audit of the cost to the NHS of ‘health tourism’, he added.

Conservative backbench MP Stewart Jackson said: ‘The strain in hot-spots, like my own constituency of Peterborough, is very, very acute, and I think that’s why we’re right to be saying there is an element of benefit tourism, particularly from the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and the Government is absolutely right to be saying to the European Commission, “Thus far and no further”.’

UKIP leader Nigel Farage claimed there was a risk of another ‘very large wave’ of immigration from the EU as a result of the economic crisis on the continent and the end to transitional controls on migration from Bulgaria and Romania.
