League One leaders Bristol City were finally beaten at the 17th time of asking on Saturday as Swindon Town closed the gap with a 1-0 victory in the West Country derby.

Away fans let off flares at the County Ground but it was unable to put Swindon off as they moved just four points behind City into second thanks to Michael Smith's cracking strike.

The visitors had been reduced to 10 men after just two minutes - with Wade Elliott being sent off for an incident involving Jack Stephens.

Swindon's rise was at the expense of Preston North End, who moved out of the automatic promotion places after losing 2-1 at home to Bradford City.

Mark Yeates' late strike ensured North End's 20-match unbeaten run came to an end at Deepdale. Joe Garner had equalised for Preston after Rory McArdle's opener but Bradford rallied late to move up to 13th.

Elsewhere, Sheffield United put a difficult week behind them to win their Yorkshire derby against Doncaster Rovers.

Paddy McCarthy was sent off for United in a week in which convicted rapist Ched Evans was allowed to return to train with the club but Jamie Murphy's 64th-minute goal gave them a 1-0 victory at the Keepmoat Stadium.

It was also a good day for Notts County, who moved up to fourth - one place ahead of United - after a 1-0 victory over Coventry City at the Ricoh Arena.

A five-goal thriller at the Priestfield Stadium saw Gillingham move above Leyton Orient into 17th.

Orient's 3-2 loss ensured they headed into the relegation zone, as Leon Legge's brace and a strike from Cody McDonald in the 90th minute gave Gillingham victory.

Gianvito Plasmati scored from the penalty spot and Chris Dagnell also netted for Orient.

Crewe Alexandra, meanwhile, moved off the bottom after securing a goalless draw against Chesterfield at Gresty Road.

Port Vale moved up into the top half of the table with a 1-0 victory over Rochdale.

Michael Brown's goal was enough to give the home side the win at Vale Park.
