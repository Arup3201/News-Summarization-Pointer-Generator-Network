Hoon drivers are cruising at speeds of up to 250km/hr along a remote stretch of Australian road and gloating about their achievements on social media.

The incredibly dangerous acts are being filmed in the Northern Territory by the drivers themselves, centering cameras on the odometer of their vehicles and then uploading them to Facebook to publicly crown their achievement.

The dashboard footage has appeared on Facebook, and the men responsible are being investigated by police. In this video, a man who identified himself as 'Fuhrer' according to the NT News, posted an incredibly high-risk photo of himself reaching 210km/hr.

The long stretch of the Stuart Highway is an open speed limit but drivers can still be charged for dangerous driving

'Fuhrer' reached speeds of more than 210km/hr along the stretch of road in Central Australia and posted the video of it on Facebook

The open speed limit route along the Stuart Highway in Central Australia goes for 204km

The one minute video is focused on the odometer of a Toyota Corolla, but was pulled from Facebook's 'NT Performance Cars' page because people expressed outrage over its content.

While many brandished it reckless, one man thought it was a platform to out-do his predecessor's top speed and post an image of himself travelling at 40km/hr faster.

Andrew Wardo Warden boasted about how he upstaged 'Fuhrer' and uploaded an image of his  dangerous speed, at close to 250km/hr, on the same Facebook page.

Police have launched a scathing attack on both drivers and said they are investigating the incidents - which appear to have been taken while travelling along a remote stretch of Australian road known as the Stuart Highway.

The highway, which connects South Australia and the Northern Territory, has a 204km/hr open speed limit but police said the open limit doesn't give drivers free rein to travel at dangerously high speeds.

Senior Sergeant Garry Smith told the NT News drivers can still be charged with reckless driving within the open speed limit zone, and According to an NT Government website: 'An unrestricted speed limit means you should drive at speeds that would keep yourself and other road users safe at all times.'

A second man boasted about how he could upstage the driver and posted an image to NT Performance Cars Facebook page travelling at more than 240km/hr

It states the Government is trialling a one-year open limit on the Stuart Highway, North of Alice Springs to Barwon Creek in central Australia.

'Regardless of the presence or absence of a nominated speed limit, dangerous driving is a serious traffic offence and can put you and other road users at risk,' the website states.

'Fuhrer' who claimed to have been driving a Toyota Corolla gloated about reaching the dangerously high speed, but posted anonymously because he is savvy social media user who wouldn't dare identify himself.

In a fiery Facebook rant he told the 'NT Performance Cars' community:  'Obviously I didn’t post with my real name cos (sic) its a video doing something illegal. How f***ing retarded can you c***s get.'

Hidden Valley Drag Association president said photographing or filming speeds while driving puts people at risk of 'injury or death to themselves and also innocent bystanders'.
