Mauricio Pochettino will be pleased enough with a comfortable victory over Champions League qualifiers Schalke but alarmed by the manner in which Spurs almost let the Bundesliga side back into the game late on.

Tottenham looked to be convincing winners until a shaky last 15 minutes – but at least saw Ben Davies get his first run out at White Hart Lane and encouraging displays from Andros Townsend, Roberto Soldado and Erik Lamela.

Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor both established credentials for starting at West Ham next week by getting on the scoresheet – but Erik Lamela’s first half display was the most intriguing.

Pochettino does seem to be coaxing performances of his compatriot, who barely registered last season after his £30m move. The Argentine looked sharp, bright and ready to impress in the first half, before being one of a number of half-time substitutions.

Lamela was involved in the opening goal’s build up, sweeping the ball to Aaron Lennon, who in turn moved it on to Lewis Holtby. The former Schalke player drove in a cross and Emmanuel Adebayor controlled and finished well on 29 minutes.

But though Spurs moved the ball well enough, Pochettino was a constant presence on the touchline, cajoling his team, urging them to calm down in possession but apparently not happy with the closing down when attempting to win the ball back.

With Jan Vertonghen, Michael Dawson, Paulinho and possibly Etienne Capoue to come back into this team and with Kyle Walker recovering from injury, Pochettino hasn’t quite shown his full hand as yet. Nevertheless there were encouraging signs. Eric Dier, born in Essex but raised in Portugal and a summer signing from Sporting, looked comfortable at centre half.

Christian Eriksen carried on where he left off last season with a fine range of passing, playing in Lennon on 14 minutes only for Schalke keeper Ralf Fahrmann to race from his line to smother the ball. And Holtby should have done better against his old club on 27 minutes but hesitated before shooting , allowing Fahrmann to save.

Schalke, who start their season their Bundesliga campaign in two weeks but who have a domestic cup tie in eight days time, offered little resistance. They sauntered through the first half, barely threatening, their only meagre offering being an off-target striker by Kevin Prince Boateng on 45 minutes.

The raft of half-time substitutions included Davies coming on and looking capable enough. Townsend looked bright, coming on for Lennon, and sprinting away to cross for Soldado, but the Spaniard lifted his shot well over on 53 minutes.

Townsend was less impressive in front of goal, curling a shot wide on 58 minutes when played in by Eriksen. However, he improved on 68 minutes, unleashing an excellent striker that Fahrman did well to push away. First to react though was Soldado, diving forward to send a looping header back over Fahrmann and into the net for 2-0.

However, Tottenham’s complacency almost allowed a victory to slip away when Dennis Aogo found room down the left to cross for former Spurs man Kevin-Prince Boateng, who stroked the ball home on 80 minutes. Hugo Lloris then got a rare touch on 83 minutes, being forced to dive to his right to touch away Donis Avdijaj’s strike.
