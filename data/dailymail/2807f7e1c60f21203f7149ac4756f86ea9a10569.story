Manchester City stars took time away from their relentless festive schedule to spread some seasonal cheer to some unfortunate children who will be spending their Christmas in the care of Manchester Children's Hospital.

Premier League millionaires including captain Vincent Kompany, Yaya Toure, Joe Hart and Bacary Sagna arrived at the hospital on Tuesday, complete with club mascots Moonchester and Moonbeam, to bring a smile to a group of sick childrens' faces by posing for pictures and signing autographs.

England keeper Hart was deemed to have safe enough hands to take hold of a recently born baby - while Toure and Kompany enlisted a pair of young team-mates to take each other on at table football - which, judging by the celebrations, was won by the Belgian defender.

After being eight points behind early pacesetters Chelsea, the reigning champions managed to temporarily draw level with the league leaders after beating Crystal Palace 3-0 on Saturday to claim a sixth consecutive victory.

Jose Mourinho's side re-opened a three-point lead with victory over Stoke City on Monday evening but, with a run of games against lower placed teams to see out 2014, City will feel confident about keeping up the pressure at the top of the table.

City face West Brom at the Hawthorns on Boxing Day before hosting Burnley and Sunderland at home - while their west London rivals have the more daunting task of playing West Ham at home ahead of visits to Southampton and Tottenham.

Meanwhile, Manuel Pellegrini has revealed that former Chelsea icon Frank Lampard's future will be resolved before the turn of the year.

Lampard is on loan from New York City until January but City have been negotiating all possible avenues to secure an extension for the 36-year-old midfielder, who has  six goals this season.

'I hope Frank's future will be resolved in the next days,' Pellegrini said, 'I said at the beginning that it will be in December when we will have the last decision. He is very important for our team so I hope that he will stay.'
