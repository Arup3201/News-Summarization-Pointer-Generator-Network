A top leader of Yemen's Al Qaeda branch has claimed responsibility for last week's attack on a Paris newspaper when two masked gunmen killed 12 people, including much of the weekly's editorial staff and two police officers.

Nasr al-Ansi, a commander of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP as the branch is known, appeared in an 11-minute internet video, saying that the massacre at Charlie Hebdo was in 'vengeance for the prophet'.

The paper had published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, which is considered an insult in Islam.

Twisted: Nasr al-Ansi, a commander of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, claimed that the Kouachi brothers, who massacred 12 people last week, were 'heroes of Islam'

Al-Ansi said France belongs to the 'party of Satan' and warned of more 'tragedies and terror'. He said Yemen's Al Qaeda branch 'chose the target, laid out the plan and financed the operation'.

He described the gunmen who carried out the massacre as 'heroes of Islam' in the 11-minute rant. 

The news follows a survivors' edition of the Charlie Hebdo magazine selling out within hours of going on sale in France, with the print run increased to five million copies.

Twitter user Eric Randolph wrote: 'My local had a queue of 70 people waiting at 5.45am.'

'The queues have stretched everywhere, but lots and lots of people are disappointed,' said Michel Blanchet, who runs a kiosk near the Gare de l'Est station. 

A handful of magazines are expected to be available in the UK by the end of the week, but British eBay users are bidding three-figure sums.

The latest cover shows a weeping Mohammed, holding a sign reading 'I am Charlie' with the words 'All is forgiven' above him.

It is appearing on newsstands one week to the day after the assault in Paris by brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi killed eight members of the Charlie Hebdo staff, including its editor and three other cartoonists, along with two police officers.

Said and Cherif Kouachi, who murdered 12 people last week in Paris, were backed by Al Qaeda in Yemen

They yelled in the street afterwards that they were wreaking vengeance for the magazine's blasphemous cartoons and jokes about figures sacred to Islam.

One killer shouted 'Charlie Hebdo is dead!' following the massacre. 

Dr Andreas Krieg, from the Department of Defence Studies at King's College London, said that the group uses attacks like this to justify its existence.

He told MailOnline: 'If the franchise and brand of Al Qaeda wants to survive it needs some shocking terror attacks to its name. Unlike ISIS Al Qaeda believes in a global jihad, namely bringing the jihad to the streets of Europe and the U.S.

'They maintain a capable fighting force. Its fighters are battle hardened with an elite whose roots go back to the mujahedeen in Afghanistan during the 1980s. They also have bomb specialists among them who have repeatedly tried to plant explosive devices on planes or other public places. From all of Al Qaeda s outfits this is one of the most active, best financially endowed, most experienced and most grounded.'

US intelligence officials, however, said they have no evidence AQAP coordinated the attack or knew about it in advance. The officials spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss classified matters publicly. 

The latest issue of Charlie Hebdo maintained the intentionally offensive tone that made the newspaper famous in France.

The first two pages include drawings by the slain cartoonists: One shows a well-known late French nun talking about oral sex; another shows Muslim, Christian and Jewish leaders dividing up the world.

The lead editorial lays out a vigorous defense of secularism, and of the newspaper's right to lampoon religions and hold their leaders accountable - and ends with a critique of the Pope.

'For the past week, Charlie, an atheist newspaper, has achieved more miracles than all the saints and prophets combined.

'The one we are most proud of is that you have in your hands the newspaper that we always made,' it reads.

It also includes a drawing of Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, with a message wishing him good health, penned by murdered cartoonist Georges Wolinski.

This picture was the last tweet by the magazine before the attack.

Elsewhere readers will find doodles by the magazine's editor, Charb, and a cartoon showing two terrorists ascending to heaven.

One, puzzled, asks where all the virgins are that they were promised. In the background the slain staff members are seen on a cloud having sex with multiple women.
