75-year-old Walter Sasse is charged with having a two year sexual relationship with a  15-year-old girl

A 75-year-old former mounted policeman for the Philadelphia Police Department has been charged with sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl.

Walter Sasse met the 15-year-old (now 17) at Courtesy Stables where Sasse was employed.

The alleged sexual relationship lasted for two years until the girl told her mother and a friend about the indecent acts.

Sasse was put behind bars on Wednesday on a list of charges including sexual assault, unlawful sexual contact with a minor, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, corruption of minors and aggravated and indecent assault, reports Philly.com.

According to court records an alleged assault happened on June 1, 2011, but police say that investigators believe the sexual relationship was ongoing and started when the girl started working at the stable.

Sasse will appear in court for a hearing on March 25. His bail was set at $50,000. He posted 10 per cent and was later released.

After Sasse retired from the police force he became a manager at the Courtesy Stable that's dedicated to 'instilling good horsemanship practices in our youth of today,' according to its website.

Philly.com spoke to a clinical and forensic psychologist, Veronique Valliere of Allentown, whio said that Sasse's position at the stable may have given him access to the child and could have enabled him to manipulate her.

She said that common interests such as horses in this case are,' not only part of the grooming process, but they also create accessibility, a forum for the relationship to form.'

Walter worked at the Courtesy Stables in Andora where employees are expected to guide youth not to lead them astray

She continued to talk about how abusers are able to use common interests as a link to form bonds and to test the boundaries of the child. Even though abusers know that what they are doing is wrong they can find a way to ignore those instincts.

She said, 'Someone like this, who's able to persuade himself that a 15-year-old is on the same physical and emotional level, he tends to be somewhat narcissistic. He likes to be worshiped, obeyed, looked up to, and gets ego gratification from those needs being met.'

Even if a teenager is flirtatious it is the adult's responsibility to take a step back.

'If a 15-year-old asked for the keys to your car, you'd say no. So, if she asked for your penis, why would you say yes?' she added.

According to his online biography, Sasse is a retired veteran who rode with the Mounted Patrol Unit's show and drill teams.

Now he faces criminal charges that could put him on the opposite side of the law.
