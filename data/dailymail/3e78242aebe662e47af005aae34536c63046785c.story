A takeaway boss has agreed with magistrates' decision to close his premises after a dead rat was found wedged between two freezers - saying: 'I would have shut it down too'.

Council inspector Lynn Fish discovered the rodent's corpse during a visit to Krunchy's Chicken and Pizza in Wigan, Lancashire.

She also found rat droppings on a shelf, sewage overflowing on the floor and rubbish piled up outside the premises.

Now, Wigan Council has obtained an emergency prohibition order on the grounds that the poor hygiene level at the takeaway represented an immediate risk of injury to health.

Juneja Anwar, the caretaker boss of the takeaway, told Wigan Magistrates' Court that he was not surprised by the decision to close the premises.

'I can't object because of what they found,' he said. 'If I was a health and safety officer I would have shut it down too.'

Ms Fish, an environmental health officer, told the court that she had gone to investigate the takeaway after a complaint was made about rubbish piling up outside the rear of the premises.

She said she was shocked to discover the dead rat stuck between two freezers - adding that a lack of doors in the property had created a 'heavy rat infestation'.

She said there was also evidence of rats gnawing away at part of the stairway, as well a mound of sewage overflowing onto the storeroom floor.

'There were three really obvious areas of rat activity, which is dangerous because rats can carry salmonella and e-coli,' she said. 'They can cause serious illness.

'This business should not be allowed to re-open until that health risk has been removed.'

Mr Anwar told the court that the owner of Krunchy's Waseem Arshar was in Pakistan following a family emergency.

He claimed Â£9,000 had already been spent on eradicating the takeaway's problems - with the final bill likely to be closer to Â£14,000.

He said the fault with the drain had been caused further down the line - adding that Krunchy's had been told by a pest control company that there was 'no problem'.

'We thought the pest control company had sorted out any problem,' he said.

Mr Anwar also denied ever having seen a rat on the premises, and outlined his intention to get the takeaway back open as soon as possible.

Magistrates awarded the council costs of Â£1,870.
