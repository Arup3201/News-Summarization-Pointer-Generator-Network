Jailed: Rachel Wilson, who plays Nikki Spraggan in the soap (pictured), was jailed in the US for hitting a woman with a bottle

Actress Rachel Wilde spent three months in an American prison for hitting a woman with a glass in a nightclub, it has been revealed today.

The EastEnders star, who plays Nikki Spraggan in the BBC soap, was working as an au pair in the states at the time.

The star, real name Rachel Wilson, was in a bar with friends when a fight broke out.

Ms Wilson, who was 18 at the time, then attempted to break up the fight but in frustration she threw a glass - which hit a woman.

She was arrested and put in prison following a trial.

Producers and actors at EastEnders know about the incident.

According to friends the East Londoner has worked hard to put the ordeal past her.

She went to The Poor School acting academy, graduating two years ago.

Her role as Nikki Spraggan was her first proper acting role and she only joined the cast in December 2013.

Speaking to The Mirror, Ms WIlson's mother Susan Wilson said: 'They know all about it at EastEnders. She has had to tell them.

'Rachel didnâ€™t actually glass the girl. She was trying to stop a fight and then she got annoyed and threw the glass but it hit somebody.

'It was so tough for me as she was only 18. She had to go to court and was in jail for three months.

'I tried to help and get her out of it. It was a tough time but sheâ€™s a girl done good now and on EastEnders.

A source close to the actress also told the newspaper: 'Rachel has always regretted what happened that night when she was 18.

'Anyone close to her knows that she isnâ€™t the type of girl who would ever intend to hurt someone.

They added she put the incident behind her and has concentrated on her career as an actress.
