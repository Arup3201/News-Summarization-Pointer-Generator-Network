A five-year-old girl saved her mother’s life by dragging her unconscious from a smoked-filled kitchen.

Epilepsy sufferer Auburn Reader, 23, had a seizure and fell to the floor while she was cooking pasta, starting a blaze at her £60,000 semi-detached house in Fochriw, near Merthyr Tydfil in Wales.

Also in the home were Miss Reader’s daughter Paige, five, and her best friend Olivia Davies, nine, who smelt smoke, raced downstairs and pulled her away from the flames before raising the alarm.

Miss Reader said: ‘They did pretty much save my life. I was cleaning the kitchen and boiling some pasta. I had accidentally dropped something onto the worktop.

‘I used the tea towel to dry it and I saw the pasta burning. I could feel a seizure coming on and put the tea towel on the side next to the cooker.’

She believes that the tea towel was hanging over the hob and caught fire, adding: ‘It was so quick I didn’t have enough time to get into the living room - it just happened there in the kitchen.’

Her seizures last between two to three minutes but can be quite violent and are caused by a variety of events. She was once having about 12 fits a day - but they now usually happen once a month.

Quick thinking: Olivia (left) and Paige (right), both pupils at Fochriw Primary School, could hear Miss Reader having a seizure and smelt smoke. The girls rushed downstairs to find her unconscious on the kitchen floor

Upstairs, Paige and Olivia, both pupils at Fochriw Primary School, could hear her having a seizure and smelt smoke. The girls rushed downstairs to find Miss Reader unconscious on the kitchen floor.

Paige and Olivia dragged Miss Reader away from the flames, pulling her almost into the living room. Olivia then picked up the phone and called her mother - Auburn’s best friend - Mary-Ellen Davies.

'If they hadn’t worked together, I could have died'

Mrs Davies, 30, said: ‘All I could hear was, “Mum, there’s a fire, come and help” but she was so panic-stricken that it was more of a scream.’

As Olivia rang ahead, Paige went outside to get help. Mrs Davies added: ‘From my house, I can see where Auburn lives. I could see Paige running out of the front door and down the garden path.’

Mrs Davies rushed to her friend’s house, where Paige pleaded with her to ‘help mummy’.

Mrs Davies told Paige to stay outside the house while she went inside, turning off the gas, but Paige followed anyway.

Inside, Olivia was lying next to Miss Reader between the kitchen and living room doorway. Mrs Davies said: ‘Olivia wouldn’t move from Auburn’s side even though there was a fire in the kitchen.’

'Mum, there's a fire, come and help'

What Paige Reader's friend Olivia Davies told her mother on the phone

As Mrs Davies went to tackle the blaze, Paige and Olivia began to drag Miss Reader out of the house.

Mrs Davies said: ‘Auburn was a dead weight after fitting. I helped them out on to the front doorstep and I asked them not to leave Auburn’s side.’

However, Olivia went around the house, opening windows to clear the smoke throughout the house, as Mrs Davies put out the fire. Miss Reader said: ‘If they hadn’t worked together, I could have died.’
