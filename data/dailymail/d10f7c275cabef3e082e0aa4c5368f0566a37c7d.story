Tottenham have been given the green light for the £400million redevelopment of White Hart Lane after a High Court challenge was rejected.

A local business had threatened to derail the development by challenging the compulsory purchase order that Spurs needed to get hold of the land to build the new 56,000-seat stadium.

And with a planning application already accepted by Haringey Council, Tottenham can now go ahead with the build that they hope will be completed in time for the 2018-19 season.

Archway Sheet Metal Works, which is located next to White Hart Lane on the last patch of land Tottenham Hotspur need for their stadium development argued that the compulsory purchase order was unlawful

This should be the final hurdle cleared for Tottenham in terms of obstacles to the building of a new 56,000-seat White Hart Lane.

Archway Sheet Metal Works have been denied permission to appeal - however, they can still ask the Court of Appeal judges directly to consider the case. They have 21 days to do so.

Spurs hope that with this challenge concluded they will be able to open the new stadium in time for start of the 2018-19 season. 

Archway Sheet Metal Works, in Paxton Road, Tottenham, asked a judge to quash the order on the grounds that it was 'unlawful and invalid' but were told there was no 'legal flaw' in the decision-making process.

If Archway had won it could have thrown plans for the world-class development into disarray. They have been refused permission to appeal, although they can still ask the Court of Appeal judges directly to consider the case. They have 21 days to do so.

Last November, a mystery fire gutted the Archway premises, which is alongside White Hart Lane's North Stand. The owners also they have received 'bomb threats'.

Mr Josif, a 46-year-old Tottenham fan who runs the business, said at the time of the fire: 'People were calling us and threatening us and we were receiving bomb threats and that started a few months ago, but we don't know if that's got anything to do with it.'

April 2008 - Spurs began investigations into the Wingate industrial estate adjacent to White Hart Lane with a view to stadium expansion.

December 2008 - Designs for the new stadium are unveiled. An intended completion date of the start of the 2012-13 season was revealed by Daniel Levy.

April 2009 - Tottenham announce they will issue 30m new shares to raise £15m for the first stage of the proposed development.

October 2009 - Planning application to Haringey Council is submitted.

May 2010 - Tottenham withdraw planning application and submit a revised plan.

March 2013 - West Ham are confirmed as Olympic Stadium tenants and Tottenham focus all attentions on the current project.

April 2013 - Public Inquiry is held about last remaining properties to be acquired.

July 2014 - Secretary of State Eric Pickles grants compulsory purchase order for the last piece of land.

February 2015 - Archway are informed there is no legal flaw in Tottenham's compulsory purchase order, removing the final hurdle. 

Mr Justice Dove said the Josif family trustees had been perfectly entitled to 'fight the appropriation of their land at each stage of the process in a legitimate and proper exercise of their rights.'

But the judge added: 'It follows from my conclusions I am satisfied there was no legal flaw in the process and it was in the public interest that this (purchase order) be made.'

The defeated Josif family members left court without making any immediate comment. They have been ordered to pay the Community Secretary's legal costs.

Both Spurs and Haringey Council applied for part of their costs to be paid by Archway, but the judge dismissed their applications.

The first phase of Tottenham's plan for the new stadium was completed in November 2013 with the opening of a Sainsbury's supermarket on the site on the new complex.

The plan for the design of the stadium itself includes a one-tier stand - similar to Liverpool's famous Kop - at one end, and will be bowl-shaped in a similar style to north London rivals Arsenal's Emirates Stadium.

The project further aims to regenerate the Tottenham area with a central square, shops, housing and the refurbishment of existing buildings included in the club's plans.
