Charged: Maxwell Sherman, 18, has been charged with murdering an 18-year-old Long Island girl

A 18-year-old man has been arrested in the brutal stabbing death of a Long Island teenage girl whose naked body was found on a footbridge after a night out with friends.

Maxwell Sherman, of Long Beach, New York, was charged Saturday with second-degree murder for killing Lauren Daverin. 

Miss Daverin, of Lynbrook, New York, was discovered dead on a footbridge in Rockville, Centre, on Thursday night. She was found stripped, except for her boots.

Her clothes were piled nearby.

WABC-TV reports that she was stabbed to death, though police have no officially commented on a cause of death.

Nassau County police would not comment on whether Miss Daverin knew Sherman or whether he allegedly attacked her at random.

A friend told Newsday that Miss Daverin was married to an airman, who was stationed at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana, when she was murdered.

Kashawn Graham, who is also from Nassau County on Long Island, has flown back home to help Miss Daverin's family with funeral arrangements.

'They embodied youthful true love,' Peter Wadkins, who introduced the couple, said.

Laura Barabasch, 18, told the New York Post that Miss Daverin as a bit of a 'wild child,' but that she was beloved by her friends.

Miss Barabasch said the footbridge where Miss Daverin was found murdered was a spot where she loved to spend times.

'The bridge we hang out on is a real fun place. I’ll come back here to remember her and all the good times we shared,' she said.

Despite her reputation for partying, she was extremely popular among her friends and classmates. More than 3,800 people have joined a memorial Facebook page, posting condolences to her family.

'In my life i never thought i could feel such loss and sadness. My little girl was taken from me last night. and there not enough words to sat that will ever make it better,' her mother Katherine Daverin wrtoe.

'Lauren i love you so much and my life will never be the same without you. goodnight my child i love you.'

Friends say she was at the Mill Pond footbridge drinking and smoking Thursday when her friends left her alone. 

When they returned and hour later, they found her brutally murdered.

David Paiz said he left Daverin with three others, two girls and Miss Daverin's boyfriend, at 9pm to get food. 

'I'm figuring maybe she was beaten. She was in a very uncomfortable, awkward position. Completely naked,' David Paiz said. 'I think she possibly got raped or something too.'

He called 911 and when authorities arrived they ruled her dead on the scene at 10:15pm.

Paiz
and his brother are the only two witnesses that have given accounts to 
the media. It's unclear when the other three friends separated from 
Daverin. So far no arrests have been made in the case, and police haven't made announcements about potential suspects.

Memories: Friends remember Daverin as a bit of a 'wild child' but altogether a great person who was loved by many

Though it is not immediately known what caused her death, police have already ruled the case a homicide and are asking anyone with information as to who might have murdered Daverin to come forward.

Investigators are reviewing surveillance footage of the area as well as Daverin's cellphone records to determine who was in the area at the time of the killing.

Emily Westermann described Daverin as a social girl who had a lot of friends.

'I don't know why this happened to her, how this happened to her, but she didn't deserve that,' she said.

Daverin's family have refused media interviews, but have expressed their feelings of loss on a Facebook memorial page.

'Every part of my heart is broken, and I cannot wait to meet you again in another life and make sure I appreciate every hug and every kiss and every fight,' her older sister wrote.
