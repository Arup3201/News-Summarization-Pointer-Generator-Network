Legal action: Dominique Strauss-Kahn is trying to get the kiss-and-tell novel Beauty and the Beast by his former mistress Marcela Iacub banned

Lawyers for Dominique Strauss-Kahn today tried to ban a book in which one of his former mistresses describes him as 'half man, half pig'.

The kiss-and-tell novel by Marcela Iacub, a 49-year-old lawyer, recounts her seven-month affair with the former International Monetary Fund chief who wanted to be President of France.

Mr Strauss-Kahn, 64, is furious that the book, called Beauty and the Beast and due out tomorrow, portrays him as a sex-mad love cheat.

His barristers told a court at the Palais de Justice in Paris that he was 'horrified' at the novel, and wants it pulped because of 'violation of the intimacy of private life', and is seeking the equivalent of 88,000 pounds in damages.

Ms Iacub said she met Mr Strauss-Kahn in Jan 2012 after coming out in his defence over the Nafissatou Diallo case, in which the New York hotel maid accused him of rape.

Arrested in May 2011, Mr Strauss-Kahn was later cleared of criminal charges due to doubts over the maid's account.

After Ms Iacub wrote an essay defending Mr Strauss-Kahn, he texted her: 'You who like writing, tell me what you want to do with me later.'

There followed a seven-month affair in which Miss Iacub said she fell totally in love with 'the king of the pigs', writing: 'Pigs have a relationship with the present that humans hardly have.

'They never cease relishing the incredible luck of being alive, eating, running, sullying, wounding, feeling.'

Mr Strauss-Kahn's lawyers today also asked for £88,000 from Le Nouvel Observateur, the magazine, which has published extracts from the new book.

If they succeed, it will be the first time a book has been banned in France since The Big Secret, the 1996 work by Francois Mitterrand's doctor which revealed the president had cancer while in office.

Kiss-and-tell: Marcela Iacub had a seven-month affair with DSK and portrays him as a sex-mad love cheat

Beauty and Beast blames Anne Sinclair, Mr Strauss-Kahn's estranged wife, for encouraging him to pursue his career as a Socialist politician instead of getting him to control his sexual urges.

'You would have transformed the Elysee into a giant swingers' club,' Ms Iacub tells Mr Strauss Kahn in the book.

'You would have used your assistants, henchmen, advisers and staff as touts, orgy organisers, experts in the art of satisfying your darkest urges.

'You claimed that you were ready to give your blood for your country when in fact you would have used this country to spill your inexhaustible sperm.'

Ms Iacub says Ms Sinclair, 64, dreamt of being first lady and thought she and her husband 'belonged to the caste of the masters of the world'.

The case continues.

Censorship: If DSK succeeds, Beauty and the Beast will be the first book banned in France since 1996
