A schoolboy had to be rescued by firemen after ignoring his teacher's orders and climbing 40ft up the front of a museum - only to break down in tears when he became frozen with fear.

The naughty 10-year-old stunned teachers when he decided to clamber up the plush stone front of the museum on the school trip with his class.

But when he reached the top of a 40ft stone column his 'Spiderboy' adventure came to an end when he burst into tears and was unable to bring himself down.

Fire crews were called out by frantic teachers and had to use a large ladder to reach the boy stuck at the National Museum Wales building in Cardiff.

The pupil had climbed the gaps in the dressed stone frontage before becoming stuck.

Onlooker Jayce Enfader, 34, said: 'I came out of the museum and saw everyone staring up at this 10-year-old boy - it was like something out of Spiderman. He was wedged in against the wall and a huge stone column.

'I'm sure he's a pain in the neck for his teachers but you had to feel sorry for the lad - he had his hands over his face and was crying his eyes out.'

The schoolboy got stuck yesterday on a class trip to the museum which houses dinosaur fossils, a national history gallery and an extensive collection of world renowned artworks.

A spokesman for South Wales Fire and Rescue said that they had been called to the museum at 1.20pm with reports that a boy was stuck in a 'precarious position'.

He said they used an extension ladder to help rescue the boy safely and had worked with South Wales Police throughout.

A National Museum Wales spokesperson said: 'We can confirm that a school pupil had attempted to climb up part of the building at the front of National Museum.

'We are very grateful to the emergency services for their work in bringing him down safely. We are pleased the situation has been resolved and no harm caused.'
