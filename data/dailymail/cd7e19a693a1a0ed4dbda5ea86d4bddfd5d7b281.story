A United Methodist minister in Pennsylvania plans to defy a church order to surrender his credentials for performing a same-sex wedding.

The Rev. Frank Schaefer said today that he cannot uphold the church's Book of Discipline because he finds it discriminatory.

The Methodist church accepts gay and lesbian members but rejects the practice of homosexuality as 'incompatible with Christian teaching'.

Schaefer says he doesn't know what will happen next. He's scheduled to meet with church officials Thursday about his future, following his conviction in a church trial last month.

Methodist Bishop Peggy Johnson acknowledges the denomination is in turmoil over the issue. She says the church uses contradictory language about sexual orientation.

Schaefer is serving a 30-day suspension from his church for leading his son's same-sex wedding in Massachusetts in 2007.

Before the punishment was announced in
November, Shaefer told the jury that he is unrepentant and refused to 
promise he wouldn't perform more gay unions.

Rather than beg for mercy, the pastor upped the stakes.

The church 'needs to stop judging people based on their sexual orientation,' he told jurors.

'We have to stop the hate speech. We have to stop treating them as second-class Christians.'

After the jury pronounced its sentence, Schaefer's supporters began overturning chairs in the courtroom - symbolizing the biblical story of Jesus overturning the tables of the money changers - and held an impromptu communion service.

Schaefer's trial rekindled debate within the nation's largest mainline Protestant denomination over church policies on homosexuality and same-sex marriage.

Schaefer donned a rainbow-colored stole on the witness stand and told jurors it symbolized his commitment to the cause.

'I will never be silent again,' he said, as some of his supporters wept in the gallery. 'This is what I have to do.'

Jon Boger, who filed the initial 
complaint against Schaefer, was outraged by the pastor's recalcitrance. 
The career Naval officer grew up in Zion United Methodist Church of 
Iona, the church that Schaefer has led for 11 years.

'Frank
Schaefer sat here and openly rebuked the United Methodist Church, its 
policies, standards and doctrines,' Bolger said when called as a 
rebuttal witness.

'He should no longer be in service as a minister of the United Methodist Church, not at Iona, not anywhere else.'

The
Methodists' prosecutor also called former members of Schaefer's church 
who said his conduct split the congregation, and experts who said the 
punishment should serve as a deterrent to other like-minded clergy.

Christina Watson said her family left Schaefer's church because they no longer wanted to be 'subjected to the preaching and teaching' of Schaefer.

'To me, it wasn't a good Christian example for ministers to say it's OK to break the rules of your church,' she testified.

The Rev. Paul Stallworth, who leads a United Methodist task force on sexuality and abortion, testified that church law requires jurors to 'openly rebuke' Schaefer so that fellow clergy will think twice before breaking it.

Schaefer had previously testified that he performed his son's 2007 wedding in Massachusetts out of love, not a desire to flout church teaching on homosexuality.

But his November testimony made clear he has had a change of heart.

'I have to minister to those who hurt and that's what I'm doing,' said Schaefer.

The prosecutor, the Rev. Christopher Fisher, invited Schaefer to 'repent of your actions' and pledge never again to perform a homosexual union.

'I cannot,' Schaefer replied.

His son, Tim Schaefer, told jurors he knew he was putting his father in a difficult position by asking him to officiate his wedding. But he concluded he would hurt his father's feelings if he didn't ask.

Schaefer said he hoped his father's trial would start a larger conversation in the denomination.
