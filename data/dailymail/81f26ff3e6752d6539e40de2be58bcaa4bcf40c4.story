Pain: Nailah Winkfield poses for a photo outside of Children's Hospital in Oakland on January 1, 2014. Nailah is the mother of Jahi McMath who has been declared brain dead by the hospital

The mother of the 13-year-old girl at the center of a battle to turn off her life-support machine broke down Wednesday as she told how she will be scarred forever by the look of fear in her daughter’s eyes as she slipped away.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline on a break from her bedside vigil, Nailah Winkfield cried as she said that her 'pretty, sweet daughter' was the 'innocent victim' of a routine operation that went tragically wrong.

Jahi McMath suffered complications after having her tonsils removed causing her heart to stop and massive brain damage that the hospital say is so severe that she is effectively dead.

Mrs Winkfield, who believes her daughter can recover and is fighting plans to turn off her ventilator, said watching her daughter suffering will haunt her forever.

'My daughter started to bleed and that will scar me forever because it happened in front of my face, in front of my mother’s face, in front of my husband’s face,' she said on a break in the grounds of Children’s Hospital, Oakland, California.

'She was very scared. She knew something was wrong. To see your daughter like that is just heartbreaking.

'But I still have hope. In fact I have 
more than hope. I am positive my daughter is going to wake up. I don’t 
have a doubt. I talk to her about it all the time.'

Grief: Marvin and Nailah Winkfield react as they speak to the Mail Online outside of Children's Hospital in Oakland  on January 1, 2014

Tragic: This is Jahi McMath's eight grade photograph (left) and another school photograph is seen (right) - the happy teen suffered brain damage after complications from routine surgery to remove her tonsils in early December

Hope: Marvin and Nailah Winkfield were granted an injunction a few days ago to keep Jahi alive until January 7th, 2014.

Mrs Winkworth, 34, a Home Depot worker, was comforted by her husband Marvin, 33, a truck driver, as she sat on the wall outside the hospital which she has not left since December 9th when the complications occurred.

'I never knew I would have to fight a hospital to treat my daughter,' she said.

'I find it unbelievable.  I have not been home since December 9th, I have been sleeping in the waiting room. I cannot leave Jahi.'

She said that the way the hospital has treated her daughter and the family has been 'disgusting'.

'The way the hospital has behaved towards me is outrageous. It is disrespectful. It is disgusting.

'They don’t even refer to her by name. They refer to her as the deceased, or the body, or the dead and my daughter is not dead.

'They are awful, they have no compassion.'

Mrs Winkfield, who has three other children, said all she wanted to do was get her daughter away from the hospital to a place that cared for her.

'The doctors here pretty much want my daughter gone', she said.

'I want the same thing but I want her out of here alive, they want her out of here dead.

'I blame the hospital for what happened. They should say ‘hey let’s do what’s right for this little girl, we messed her up,  we owe her, the least we can do is let her get out of here’.'

She said that feels a mixture of anger, sadness and guilt.

'I feel angry at the hospital,' she said.

'Sad for my daughter and guilty because I made her have the operation.

'She told me not to make her have the operation. She was scared. She said her worst fear was never waking up, that’s what she told me. That is why I feel guilty.

'I just wished I had picked a different hospital. When I first heard things had gone wrong,  I passed out from shock.'

She said she was puzzled why the hospital was blocking the family’s bid to move Jahi.

'I think they are trying to cover up something and I think they would rather she dies than I prove them wrong that she is alive,' she said.

One of the issues, is that the hospital is refusing to fit a feeding tube to the patient as they say they don’t operate on dead people.

The operation must be carried out before a care facility can take her in.

'I don’t believe what the hospital are saying,' said Mrs Winkfield.

'If she was an organ donor she would have everything to make her body healthy,' she said.

'In fact she would have much better treatment if she was an organ donor but since I want her to live she doesn’t have proper treatment.'

Putting her head in her hands she borke down and sobbed as she said: “She was so pretty. She didn’t deserve this.

Precautions: Officials saw to it that the door to the Children's Hospital of Oakland was barricaded Monday in preparation for Jahi's family's press conference

'I feel scared every day. I feel my daughter is on death row because they have only given us so much time.

'I feel like her life is like the sand in an egg timer and we are watching it pouring away. Every time we get a court order, a big hand comes out and turns it over.

'I just have to keep faith. I just want to get her away from here. They don’t want her here.

'That’s why they are not feeding her, that’s why they don’t refer to her by her name. That’s why they call her the deceased.

'She has not done anything to anybody. I had a good daughter. She don’t deserve what has happened to her.  She is an innocent victim.

'I spent Christmas here. I spent New Year’s here and I won’t leave. My New Year’s wish is that my daughter wakes up or the hospital softens their heart.'

Tragedy: Jahi McMath, 13, was declared legally 
brain-dead after undergoing a routine tonsil removal that dosctors 
suggested as a means of eliminating her sleep apnea

Her husband added: 'It has been an emotional rollercoaster that she is on. Up one minute, down one minute.

'We got so many good memories. As they hit her and me, at different times. You are up one minute but a good memory just brings you down.'

The couple were speaking as the hospital and family continued their war of words over the future of the teenager.

Sam Singer, the spokesman for the hospital, said that the family’s lawyer Chris Dolan was cruelly perpetuating the 'hoax' that Jahi was still alive.

Hospital spokesperson Sam Singer speaks to the media outside Children's Hospital in Oakland on  January 1, 2014. The court granted an injunction a few days ago to keep Jahi alive until January 7th, 2014

He said it was a terribly sad case but that three doctors and the courts had agreed that there was no hope for the girl.

But Mr Dolan, and the family, said this was not true and that the hospital was trying to deflect the blame of what had happened to Jahi.

He said that they were close to finding a doctor and transport to move the patient to a new medical facility.

Meanwhile the Californian Department of Public Health, which licenses medical facilities, confirmed they were investigating the hospital over the incident.

They will report their findings at a later date, a spokeswoman said.
