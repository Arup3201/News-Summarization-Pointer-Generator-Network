Cabinet minister Ken Clarke said British voters should not become isolationist

Ken Clarke yesterday said British personnel should be sent to Syria to destroy the regime’s chemical weapons as he branded the public guilty of ‘isolationism’ for failing to back military action.

The veteran Cabinet minister signalled that Britain is prepared to help police a deal to destroy Bashar al-Assad’s lethal stockpile after the dictator yesterday admitted he had weapons of mass destruction and was prepared to give them up.

Government sources said a United Nations report to be published next week is expected to reveal fresh evidence that Assad’s regime fired sarin nerve gas last month, killing nearly 1,500 civilians.

He ruled out sending in troops insisting he was ‘flatly against boots on the ground’ but said the UK must stand ready to implement the extraordinary Russian plan to put the chemical weapons beyond use.

With US Congress poised to vote on missile strikes against the Assad regime this week, the Syrian government dramatically accepted a Russian proposal to turn over control of its chemical weapons to the international community.

David Cameron has demanded a deadline be set for the plan to be enacted to prove it was a serious one.

Speaking to journalists in Westminster today, Mr Clarke said: ‘I think we have got to be cautious, we have got to be careful.

‘We must ensure that this is genuinely going to remove these chemical weapons and then all these things can be decided.

‘But I think the British will be supportive of anything which genuinely looks like bringing an end to the threat of gas attacks and chemical weapons that is lurking there in Syria at the moment.’

Asked if that could mean weapons against from the British military being sent in to Syria, Mr Clarke replied: ‘I can’t think of any reason in principle why if British expertise is required, British expertise should not be involved.

‘As far as I am aware nobody has yet asked that question.'

He went on: ‘I would always be flatly against boots on the ground in the Syrian civil war but actually experts in chemical warfare, if we were persuaded that we needed to make a contribution to their destruction, fine.

‘But at the moment we are at a very early stage. We have got to get the outcome we want without being perceived to be naïve about exactly the basis upon which it is going to proceed.’

Ken Clarke today backed George Osborne as a 'contender' to become the next Tory leader.

He said the Chancellor is 'bound to be a contender at any stage'.

But he insisted: 'I can think of nothing more harmful to the interest of my party or any of its members than to start speculating about that kind of thing.'

He also warned London Mayor Boris Johnson not to get carried away with the media frenzy around his own leadership ambitions.

'I did give the advice to Boris when we had Boris Day at last year’s party conference , when the whole thing erupted far beyond I think what Boris expected .

'He arrived to find the whole place in mass media turmoil. My advice to him, if he has interests in the leadership, I would cool it.'

Mr Clarke warned Britons against 
'isolationism' and said one of the big failures of the New Labour 
government was the legacy of the Iraq war in making voters scepticial of
the need to intervene overseas in the national interest.

Rebel forces dismissed the Russian proposal as ‘a cheap trick to buy time for the regime to kill more and more people’.

Any deal with Syria to hand over its chemical weapons in the middle of a chaotic civil war would be difficult for inspectors to enforce and destroying them would likely take years, U.S. officials and experts caution.

Syria's strongest backer, Russia, proposed on Monday that Damascus save itself from a U.S. military strike over its alleged use of chemical weapons by putting its stockpiles under international control.

The proposal was welcomed by Syria and seized upon by the secretary-general of the United Nations. U.S. President Barack Obama said the offer was a potential breakthrough but had to be handled with scepticism.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today said there had to be an end to the military conflict.

He told LBC 97.3: ‘You can’t sort of hermetically seal Syria; that’s just not realistic.

‘So at the end of the day, you have to really pressure these two sides to recognise that there is no resolution to this militarily.

‘And here is always a big difficulty with conflict, is if the sides in the conflict don’t want peace as much as the outside world, it’s always going to be a bit of a struggle.

‘They’ve got to at some point recognise that they’re on a hiding to nothing by carrying on this conflict.'
