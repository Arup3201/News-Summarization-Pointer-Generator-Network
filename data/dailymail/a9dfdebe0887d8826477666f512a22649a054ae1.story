Andy Murray is working on returning to the shape of his life ahead of the new tennis season and it's going well judging by his latest Instagram pictures.

The 2013 Wimbledon champion is currently training in Miami ahead of the Australian Open, starting next month.

And on Saturday he posted an image of him collapsed on the beach, together with the caption 'Brutal fitness session on the beach. My trainer Matt doesn't hold much sympathy though.. haha #Miami #MiamiTrainingBlock #nopainnogain.'

Murray is going through pre-season training in Miami ahead of the Australian Open next month

Murray has kept himself out of the media spotlight in recent weeks as he knuckles down with his pre-season training.

He split with long-standing assistant coach Dani Vallverdu and physical trainer Jez Green last month and will continue with Amelie Mauresmo, while he is expected to announce a new clothing deal with Under Armour.

But he is now putting in the hard yards as he aims for more Grand Slam glory. 

The Australian Open runs from January 19-February 1.
