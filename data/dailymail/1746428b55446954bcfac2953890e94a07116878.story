Fears are growing for a 19-year-old lingerie model who disappeared more than a month ago.

Blonde Kara Nichols was last seen on October 9 on her way to work in Denver, Colorado, U.S.

Police searching for the missing teen said it appears the model never made it to work that day, and added that it was 'really uncharacteristic' of Miss Nichols not to get in touch with her family and friends.

Vanished: There has been no trace of the 19-year-old lingerie model since she made a call from her mobile phone at 11.45pm on October 9

There has been no trace of the teenager, who lives in Colorado Springs, since she made a call from her mobile phone at 11.45pm on the day she vanished.

'What causes us concern is that it is really uncharacteristic of her not to be in contact with her friends and family,' said Sergeant Joe Roybal, from the El Paso County Sheriff's Office.

Officers' attempts to reach Miss Nichols on her mobile phone or to establish the phone's location have proved unsuccessful, Sgt Roybal told The Huffington Post.

Mystery: Police in Colorado say it is 'really uncharacteristic' for Kara Nichols not to be in contact with friends and family

Concerns: Kara's family have contacted the National Women's Coalition Against Violence and Exploitation to try and raise awareness of her disappearance

The teenager's stricken family have set the 'Help Us Find Kara Nichols' Facebook page and teamed up with the National Women's Coalition Against Violence and Exploitation to raise awareness of her mysterious disappearance.

Friend Rachel Buster told KKTV News she was 'very scared' for the 5ft 8in 19-year-old, who is understood to have taken up underwear modelling in February of this year.

Her Model Mayhem profile says that, while she is new to the profession, she is 'very passionate' about modelling.

'Currently I'm working on building my portfolio so I'm always looking for modelling opportunities in my area,' it reads.

'I've done mostly lingerie shoots so far but I'm extremely open-minded.'

Search: Police are hoping somebody will come forward with clues as to the 19-year-old's whereabouts

Sgt Roybal said officers had discovered nothing to indicate that a crime had been committed or any evidence of foul play.

'We really don't have any indication as to why she hasn't been in contact,' he said.

'The only thing that concerns us is that she has not been in contact with anybody.'

The officer said police want to raise awareness of the case in the hope that somebody might come forward with information on the whereabouts of the teenager.

'We're hoping for a best case scenario,' he added.

Miss Nichols is 5ft8ins tall and weighs 120lbs. She has blonde hair and green eyes, and tattoos on her wrist and ankle.
