The refusal of the US government to pay the $132 million ransom demanded by James Foley's ISIS captors has exposed the grubby payments that compliant European nations make for their kidnapped citizens around the world.

Because while the US and the UK categorically do not negotiate with terrorists and present a united front, their NATO allies frequently enter clandestine talks and have paid millions to get their people home.

This year alone ISIS and Al-Qaeda are believed to have received ransom payments for three Spanish journalists released in April, and four French journalists who were freed two weeks later.

Indeed, the ransom trade has fueled the seemingly inexorable rise of ISIS, pushing it to grow in strength.

Just today, Chuck Hagel, the US Defense Secretary called ISIS 'well funded', no doubt as a result of their activities in extorting money in ransom from European governments

'ISIS is as well funded and sophisticated a group we have seen...This is beyond anything we have ever seen'.

FRANCE   $58.1m

QATAR AND OMAN  $20.4m

SWITZERLAND   $12.4m

SPAIN   $11m

AUSTRIA   $3.2m

According to the New York Times it wants to emulate the business model of al-Qaeda who have raked in upwards of $125 million over the last five years in ransom -  - mostly from European nations.

According to a statement by the US Treasury in June, ransom payments are now the second largest source of income for terrorist groups, after state sponsorship.

But all anti-terrorism experts agree that the paying ransoms perpetuates the problem of hostages.

More so, it means that American's stance on non-negotiation is undermined and means Americans face never be released without the use of force.

The leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has even described kidnappings as 'an easy spoil' giving swift income to his terror network.

'Thanks to Allah, most of the battle costs, if not all, were paid from through the spoils,' the newspaper quoted him as saying.

'Kidnapping hostages is an easy spoil, which I may describe as a profitable trade and a precious treasure.'

The most prominent case - involving by far the most money - was that of four French nuclear firm employees who stunned the world when they were returned unharmed after three years in captivity.

Pierre Legrand, Thierry Dol, Daniel Larribe and Marc Feret were captured in September 2010 while working on a uranium mine in northern Niger.

Their touchdown at a military airport near Paris in October, where they were met by President Francois Hollande, prompted world headlines amid claims a heavy price had been paid.

The French government insisted it used diplomacy to free the four men, with Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian saying: ‘France has held the same position for the past three years - we don’t pay.'

But the French newspaper Le Monde, renowned for its secret service contacts, reported the country's intelligence agencies paid 20million Euros or $28 million for their release.

The New York Times investigation puts this figure far higher - at 30million Euros or $39 million which it is claimed was paid by a state-owned company.

The New York Times also claims France paid Al Qaeda 12.5million Euros or $16 million in 2011 to free three hostages from France, Togo and Madagascar.

The total - $58 million - means France's payments were almost than triple those of the next-highest payer, Qatar and Oman with $19.9 million.

Switzerland also paid $12,11 million, Spain paid $10.78 million and Austria paid $3.15 million, while the source of another $21.57 million in ransom money could not be determined.

Indeed, according to recently released prisoners, their ISIS captors were extremely aware of their prisoners monetary value, as judged by their nationality.

It was six weeks after a failed July 4 mission to rescue James Foley authorized by President Obama involving 'nearly every US military service' that his captors sent his family and the US government a $132 million ransom demand.

As well as money, the terror group had also requested the release of Aafia Siddiqui, an M.I.T. graduate and Pakistani neuroscientist with ties to Al Qaeda currently locked up in Texas.

Over the nearly two years he was hostage, James Foley's parents received numerous financial demands to secure his release.

His family were explicitly told by the government to not discuss the ransom demands with the press nor to name ISIS as his kidnappers.

According to Reuters journalist, David Rohde, Foley believed he would ultimately be freed by his own government.

'Foley believed that his government would help him,' says Rohde according to The Wrap.

'In a message that was not made public, Foley said that he believed so strongly that Washington would help that he refused to allow his fellow American captives to not believe in their government.'

Ransom:
 It has emerged that ISIS demanded a staggering $132m ransom for the 
return of Foley. Philip Balboni, the CEO and co-founder of GlobalPost, 
the Boston-based website that Foley was reporting for when he was 
captured told MailOnline it was considerably higher than for European 
captives 'purely because he was an American

His former boss, GlobalPost co-founder and CEO Philip Balboni told WCVB on Wednesday that he spent millions trying to secure his reporter's release.

'You know when you kidnap someone and hold them for almost two years, you don't do it unless you believe there is value in those hostages.'

'We received an email from the captors on Wednesday night of last week stating their intention to execute Jim,' Balboni said.

'The email was full of rage. We pleaded with the captors for mercy, but to no avail.'

Now, the failure to free Foley or negotiate his release has backed the president into a corner as he deals with the threat to kill the second hostage paraded in front of the camera on Tuesday, Steven John Sotloff.

Indeed, at the end of Tuesday's grisly video, Foley's executioner, who is widely believed to be British, delivers an ominous threat towards the White House.

'The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,' 

Sick
 propaganda: James was forced to say in the beheading video: 'Think 
about what you are doing. Think about the lives you destroy, including 
those of your own family,' before he was murdered

Inspiration:
 Diane and John Foley Snr., told reporters outside their home in New 
Hampshire on Wednesday how James was inspired to report in war zones 
because of his brothers in the military

The policy of non-negotiation, which the US shares with UK, now puts it increasingly at odds with many of it NATO partners.

In an opinion piece for Reuters, David Rohde, who works for the news agency argues that by launching a mission and not paying the ransom contributed to Foley's death.

'The payment of ransoms and abduction of foreigners must emerge from the shadows. It must be publicly debated,' wrote Mr. Rohde, who escaped from the Taliban himself by climbing out of a window.

'American and European policy makers should be forced to answer for their actions.'
