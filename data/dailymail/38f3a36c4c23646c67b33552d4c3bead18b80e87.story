Shocking: Lewis Eddleston was playing in a field when he left them for a moment - and never returned

Friends of a 13-year-old boy who drowned after leaving them playing in fields near his home have written him an anguished note saying: 'Wish we followed you'.

Schoolboy Lewis Eddleston was playing just a mile from his home in Doncaster, South Yorks., on Sunday when he told friends to look after his phone while he used the toilet at around 4pm - but never came back.

Yesterday, police said they had found the body of a boy in a ditch just over a mile from the field where Lewis was last seen, and they confirmed the cause of death as drowning today.

Today, bouquets of flowers, cards and pictures were laid in the field where popular Lewis was found - which can be seen from his house.

One tribute read: 'Going to miss you loads bro. Wish we followed you.

'Going to miss you and your typical but amazing ways. Love you millions. Lewis Eddleston RIP. Bro rest in peace. Love you.'

Other emotional messages said: 'To my prince Lewis. Thinking of you always. Lots of love. I love you. Leonie xxxx' and 'My beautiful Lewis Eddleston. Rest in peace gorgeous. I won’t forget you. Lots of love Katie'.

Another said: 'To Lewis RIP dude your (sic) never going to be forgotten. I love you my little soldier. Lots of love Kirstie.'

The brightly coloured flowers were laid against a gate on Hunger Hill Lane, where police found a body in a ditch.

Lewis's family criticised police today over their handling of the search. His brother Michael said the family was 'very angry' with the lack of initiative by officers.

He told ITV Calendar News: 'My mum has sat at home having to phone the police every few hours.

'But we didn't even get phone calls from them, no updates. We've just been sat there having to do it ourselves. We've been on our own, apart from the community.'

Moving: Friends and family left flowers and emotional messages near the field that Lewis vanished from

Police today officially confirmed that the body found close to the Boulevard in Edenthorpe was that of Lewis, who lived nearby.

A post-mortem examination revealed he
died by drowning soon after he was seen leaving playing fields on 
Sunday evening, police said.

His death is not being treated as suspicious.

A South Yorkshire Police spokesman said: 'Family liaison officers continue to support Lewis's family at this difficult time.

'South Yorkshire Police wish to 
reiterate its thanks to the local community for the support provided in 
the search for Lewis, which was complicated by a number of false 
sightings reported on social media sites.

'An investigation continues into the circumstances surrounding the tragic event.'

Graham Wakeling, the head teacher of 
Hungerhill School, which Lewis attended, said: 'The school community is 
devastated by the news of Lewis's sudden death which was a shock to us 
all.

'Our thoughts and condolences are 
with his family and close friends at this very difficult time. Lewis was
an extremely popular young man with a good sense of humour.

Discovery: Police officers found Lewis's body in a ditch in Doncaster, near to where he disappeared

'He was a lively character around the
school and always had a smile on his face. Lewis will be sadly missed 
by pupils and staff at Hungerhill.'

A number of teenagers and adults left flowers at the police cordon as news of the discovery spread yesterday.

Jack Neal, 14, said he was in the 
same school year as Lewis. 'He liked to have fun,' Jack said. 'He always
had a laugh. He was a good friend.'

Jack's mother Clair Neal said: 
'There's a lot of youngsters this age tonight feeling pretty devastated.
There's lots of upset people. I spoke to a few of the mums that've got 
children in the same year. He was such a well-liked boy.'

Lewis’ mother Diane was too upset to 
speak on today. A neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'Lewis 
was a lovely lad, everyone knew him. We are a close knit community and 
this will hit us hard.'

A cordon has been erected around the area where police discovered the body

Lewis’ neighbour Royce Lambert, 49, said: 'People are devastated,' said the married father of two.

'He was a great kid, your typical 13-year-old boy. I had to tell him off a few times for climbing on my garage but that’s just what lads his age do.'

The retired Royal Marine said on Wednesday: 'My thoughts are with the family.

'It’s been hard for them while he has been missing but this news is truly heartbreaking.

'Nobody knows what’s happened to him yet, whether it’s been an accident or something else.

Before the body was discovered, Lewis’s mother Diane said his disappearance was out of character as appealed for her son to return home.

She said: 'He has never done anything like this before - it is totally out of character.

'We had had a lovely family bonfire on Saturday night and there were no problems at home or at school.

'We just want to know he is safe, we have no idea where he is or what has happened and we are worried sick.

'I just hope he sees this and gets in touch to let us know he is OK.'

Police have erected a cordon around the scene where the body was found, an area locals said was used mainly by dog walkers and youngsters using it as a short-cut to school.

One resident said: 'Other than the lane that runs through it, it's mainly marshland and reeds with a sort of ditch running through the middle.'
