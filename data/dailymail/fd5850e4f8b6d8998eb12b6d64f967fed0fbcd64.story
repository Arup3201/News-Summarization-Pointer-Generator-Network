More than a dozen passengers and crew have reportedly been injured after an American Airlines flight was rocked by severe turbulence over the Pacific Ocean.

Passengers were settling into their 12-hour transpacific journey from Seoul to Dallas when the Boeing 777-200 hit turbulent skies east of Japan, sending glass 'flying' inside the aircraft cabin, according to a woman on board.

With as many as 15 passengers and crew reportedly in need of medical assistance the flight crew declared an emergency, turned the plane around and diverted to Narita International Airport near Tokyo.

Passenger Erin Cherry wrote on Twitter: 'Landed in Tokyo after massive, massive turbulence on #aa280. Broken glass etc flying inside cabin. Some were injured.'

NHK, Japan's public broadcaster, said at least 14 people were injured.

American Airlines issued a statement confirming the incident, but it did not reveal how many people were injured on board the plane, which was carrying 240 passengers and 15 crew. 

The airline said: ‘American’s primary concern at this time is for our passengers and crew on board the airplane and our team in Narita is providing assistance.’ 

The Boeing 777 – the world’s largest twin-engine passenger jet – was met by firefighters and paramedics when it touched down. 

It departed Seoul’s Incheon International Airport at 6:16pm local time and landed at the airport east of Tokyo shortly before 1am local time, about four hours after its departure.

The Weather Channel, a US television network, said the plane encountered turbulence while flying through a ‘rapidly intensifying winter storm’ that is expected to become a ‘weather bomb’.

The network said the storm is associated with a powerful ribbon of 150-200mph winds in the jet stream, approximately 38,000ft above sea level.

The storm has prompted blizzard warnings for northern and western Japan, and high wind warnings for coastal areas near Tokyo.

According to flight radar data, the plane was east of Japan when it turned south and then west as it diverted to one of the world’s five busiest airports.

It was scheduled to land at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport at 3pm local time on Wednesday.
