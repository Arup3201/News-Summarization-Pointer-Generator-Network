ISIS sympathisers took to Twitter today to share a photograph of a balaclava-clad, left-handed militant they claimed to be a new image of the terror group's executioner in chief, Jihadi John. 

Brandishing the same style of combat knife used by the British militant during the sickening filmed murders of three American nationals, two British aid workers and 22 Syrian soldiers, the alleged terrorist bears a striking resemblance to Jihadi John.

This is despite the fact his face is largely covered by a similar style of black balaclava worn by the famously left-handed killer in the five chilling ISIS murder videos in which  has appeared.

The image was widely shared by Islamic State sympathisers today after apparently being uploaded to picture messaging app SnapChat by a French militant, who captioned it with the words 'Do you recognise him?' and suggested he had spent 'a day with Jihadi John'.

But despite capturing the attention of the world's media, it can now be revealed that the image was first uploaded to Twitter on November 29 by a man claiming to be a Dutch fighter who has since come forward to say the masked militant in the photograph is in fact him.

Questions: The image was widely shared by ISIS sympathisers today after apparently being tweeted by a French jihadi who claimed to have spent the day with Jihadi John. However the same photograph was uploaded to Twitter last month by a man claiming to be a Dutch ISIS fighter

Real deal: The famously left-handed killer known as Jihadi John has now appeared in five ISIS murder videos

The image that apparently showed Jihadi John was shared on Twitter by a radical calling himself Abu Anas Mujahid, who appeared to suggest he had spent time with the ISIS executioner.

The photograph was captioned: 'A day with Jihadi John - may the eyes of cowards never sleep #IslamicState.'

Other ISIS sympathisers claimed the photograph first emerged on the SnapChat account of a French militant who captioned it with the words 'Do you recognise him?'.

But despite the buzz of excitement among warped fans of the cold-blooded killer, it subsequently emerged that the same picture was first shared online late last month by a man claiming to be a Dutch ISIS militant who suggested he had been simply pretending to be Jihadi John.

This afternoon he returned to Twitter and, using the account @FightingJMedia, began pointing out that the person in the photograph is in fact him.

Denial: Despite the buzz of excitement among warped fans of the cold-blooded killer, the same picture was first shared online by a Dutch militant last month (below). Today the Dutchman said it is him in the photo

Killer: The real Jihadi John was reportedly seriously wounded in an US-led air strike in November after meeting with ISIS chiefs, including the group's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Iraq 

Return: The real Jihadi John was reportedly seriously wounded in an US-led air strike in November, but just days later appeared in a sickening filmed beheading video of 22 Syrian soldiers (pictured)

Adding to the confusion, another set of ISIS sympathisers claimed the photograph shows an unknown British militant calling himself Abu Sumayyah who they said recently carried out a suicide bombing somewhere in Iraq.

This claim is likely to be a mistaken reference to Kabir Ahmed - a 32-year-old father of three from Derby who used the same nom de guerre and who became the 29th Briton to die fighting for ISIS when he carried out a suicide bomb attack in the strategic Iraqi town of Baiji last month.

The real Jihadi John was reportedly seriously wounded in an US-led air strike in November after meeting with ISIS chiefs, including the group's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Iraq.

The masked ‘executioner’ was said to have narrowly escaped death when the leadership summit  in a town close to the Syrian border was targeted by American and Iraqi warplanes.

Just days after the alleged strike, however, the militant appeared in a sickening filmed beheading video of 22 Syrian soldiers, which also showed the severed head of American Peter Kassig.
