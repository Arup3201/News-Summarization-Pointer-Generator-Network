Jeremy Clarkson has hit back at a Labour MP's criticism of Top Gear by saying: 'We don't make it for people who wear pink ties.'

The Top Gear presenter launched the bizarre attack after Labour's transport chief Michael Dugher said the car fanatic was 'basically an idiot'.

He also claimed Clarkson gives drivers a bad name, leading anyone with a car to be wrongly portrayed as a 'petrolhead', when in reality driving is the only way to get around outside London.

Controversial Top Gear star Jeremy Clarkson (pictured trying on a pink tie) has hit back at claims by Labour MP Michael Dugher that he is an 'idiot' who gives drivers a bad name

The presenter tweeted to his 4.4m followers: 'We don't make it for people who wear pink ties'

Mr Dugher, who had said Clarkson gave off the impression that all motorists were 'petrolheads', replied saying: 'Obviously I wear red ties a lot. But what's wrong with the occasional pink one?!'

Mr Dugher also insisted the BBC 2 show was just 'old blokes wearing jeans and sports jackets' are 'not remotely representative' of millions of people who drive.

But Clarkson decided to hit back at the comments, telling his 4.4m Twitter followers that he thought it was 'good' Mr Dugher did not like the show.

The controversial presenter added: 'Labour's transport spokesman say he doesn't like Top Gear. Good. We don't make it for people who wear pink ties.' 

Mr Dugher responded just minutes later, seemingly undeterred by the comment. 

He replied: 'Obviously I wear red ties a lot. But what's wrong with the occasional pink one?! What on earth might someone be implying?' 

Clarkson later tweeted, rather cryptically: 'I don't like Jupiter. It gives all the other planets a bad name. I mean I haven't been there but...'  

The online spat came after Mr Dugher took aim at Clarkson, a friend of David Cameron's and member of Chipping Norton set, in an interview with House magazine.

He said: 'Jeremy Clarkson – I have no time for him. It's not just his politics. I mean the guy is basically an idiot. 

'And the idea that he is somehow the motorists' representative? No he's not, he represents himself. He's not remotely representative of motorists.

'There's a caricature of people like 'petrolheads'. They're not 'motorists'. They're people who have a car. That's a lot of people – it's how most of us move around most of the time.

'We've got to stop that caricaturing of a petrolhead, or a Clarkson. Top Gear, a bunch of old blokes wearing jeans and sports jackets? They're not remotely representative.'

There are 30million drivers in the UK, but Mr Dugher warned that they are unfairly targeted by politicians and officials working in London where public transport is more popular.

The shadow transport secretary claimed politicians spend 'most of their time talking to the minority of people who don't' drive, because Parliament is based in the capital.

'The vast majority of people, their daily journey is by road. Most people have a car, and use their car a lot.'

He complained that the perception of drivers was skewed by the popularity of Top Gear, which Clarkson presents with James May and Richard Hammond. 

But Andy Wilman, Top Gear's executive producer, hit back. He said: 'He must be Mystic Meg if he knows what we do without watching the show.

'If he bothered to watch it, he would know that we take as much pleasure out of celebrating a £1,500 estate car battling its way across Africa as we do from a Bugatti Veyron running at top speed. I'll take his point on the jeans though.'

Mr Dugher tore into the hit BBC Two show hosted by Richard Hammond, Jeremyt Clarkson and James May, insisting 'old blokes wearing jeans and sports jackets' are 'not remotely representative' of millions of people who drive

Top Gear is one of the BBC's biggest global hits, attracting millions of viewers and generating millions of pounds with stunts and regular features like A Star In A Reasonably Priced Car, in which a celebrity drives around a race track against the clock.

Former Labour MP Stephen Ladyman once appeared on the show when a transport minister.

But Mr Dugher rejected the idea he would join Clarkson, May and Hammond: 'I don't watch the programme, it's not my kind of telly.'

Andy Wilman, Executive Producer, Top Gear, said: 'He must be Mystic Meg if he knows what we do without watching the show. If he bothered to watch it, he would know that we take as much pleasure out of celebrating a £1500 estate car battling its way across Africa as we do from a Bugatti Veyron running at top speed. I'll take his point on the jeans though'

Mr Dugher signalled that he wanted to end the idea that Labour wanted to wage war on the motorist.

'I want to shift the tone of the national debate. The vast majority of people, their daily journey is by road.

'Given that most people spend most of their time travelling by road, I've felt for a long, long time – and this is a criticism of all governments – that politicians spend most of their time talking to the minority of people who don't. And that just seems a very odd approach.

'We're sat in the middle of Westminster. So many of the politicians and the journalists and the civil servants, we all work in central London.

'Their personal experience of the transport network is not representative of the rest of the country. So it's a collective failure. Why wouldn't you talk to people about how they choose to travel most of the time?'

He stressed that there is a 'whole bunch of reasons' why people choose to drive, including the fact that in many areas bus and train services are expensive and unreliable. 'I'm not going to punish people in those circumstances,' he said.

The number of women stories has risen sharply in recent decades. Figures in 2012 showed the number of new drivers is rising twice as quickly among women as it is among men.

Mr Dugher said: 'There's been huge growth in women drivers over recent decades. That's been an empowering thing for women.

'And a good thing. But why do women particularly choose to use cars? Perhaps because they've got a greater burden of childcare responsibilities; it's 'mum's taxi', a lot of it. It's also about their access to employment.

'And it's also, in an evening in the winter, when it's dark, it's because they feel safer than on some aspects of public transport. I'm not going to persecute people for making those kinds of absolutely legitimate choices.'
