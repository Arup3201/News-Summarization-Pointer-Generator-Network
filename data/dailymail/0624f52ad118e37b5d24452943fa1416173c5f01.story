British contestants have been warned of violent threats from Islamic extremists during this year’s Miss World contest in Indonesia.

The British, US and Australian 
Embassies in Jakarta have warned the contestants that extremist groups 
may be planning to use violence to disrupt the pageant, which is running
until September 28.

The competition was moved from the capital on Java where the majority of residents are Muslim to Bali.

Protestors speak out against the 'pornographic' Miss World pageant due to be held in Bali

The competition was moved to Bali after organisers feared an attack could be made in Jakarta, Java

The British Embassy warned:‘local Islamist vigilante groups have 
threatened to hold large-scale demonstrations to disrupt the Miss World 
pageant.’

'Extremist groups may also be planning to attack the event'.

Britain
is represented by three contestants - Kirsty Heslewood from England, 
Gabrielle Shaw from Wales and Meagan Green from Northern Ireland.

With
a history of terror attacks on foreign visitors - including the 
horrific 2002 Bali bombings when 202 people were killed - the warnings 
are being taken seriously by the Miss World organisers.

Children were among the crowds during protests on the Island of Bali which was considered a lesser threat by the competition's officials due to it's predominantly Hindu population

Extra security has been brought in to
guard the venue in the Noosa Dua region of the holiday island following
weeks of protest which denounced the competition as 'pornography'. 

Despite
the demonstrations a beauty contest for Muslim women has been held 
peacefully in Bali, with 21-year-old Miss Obabiyi Aishah Ajibola from 
Nigeria, being declared the winner.

Contestants modeled Islamic fashions 
and answered questions to demonstrate their knowledge of the Koran and 
other religious values.

The finalists for World Muslimah were chosen from more than 500 women who took part in an online selection process.

Obabiyi Aishah Ajibola of Nigeria was crowned as the winner of the Muslimah World competition in Jakarta on September 18

Despite protest from Islamic extremists calling the Miss World pageant 'pornographic' a beauty competition for Muslim women only was held in Jakarta

Among the rounds, competitors were asked to relate how they came to wear the Muslim headscarf, the hijab.

When her name was called as the winner, Miss Ajibola fell to her knees and recited a verse from the Koran.

Her prize includes a trip to Mecca.
