The number of people renting homes has soared by a staggering 89 per cent in 10 years as householders struggle to get on the housing ladder, new data has revealed.

Figures show a dramatic rise in the number of tenants in England and Wales, from 1.9million households in 2001 to 3.6million in 2011.

The rise has lead to a surge in the number of 'rental hotspots' emerging across the country.

In 2001 there were just eight 'hotspot' 
areas in England and Wales that had between 20 and 40 per cent of homes 
rented out, but by 2011 this had climbed to 51 areas.

Rental surge: The flooding of colour across the 2011 map shows how widespread this new market has become, with large numbers of people renting in London, Kent, Nottingham and Leicester 

Changing times: The rental picture looked dramatically different in 2001 with large swatches of people in Wales, Devon and Cornwall and parts of the North renting properties ten years ago

Experts say the phenomenon - dubbed 'Generation Rent' - is down to the battle 
many face to raise enough money for a house deposit, and the older 
generation being forced to release capital from their own homes to pay 
for their care in later life.

Traditionally,
London has always been the area where large numbers of people choose to
rent, due to the spiraling cost of buying.

However the new data shows that in the past decade this has expanded to include large pockets of the South, East and North.  Now only a few small areas of the country have little or no properties lived in by tenants.

Hotspot: Many
of the renting hotspots tend to be university cities or major business hubs, 
but more unusual hotspots include Torbay, (pictured) Eastbourne and Hastings where landlords are cashing in

Others include Blackpool, Liverpool and Salford in the North West, Nottingham and Leicester in the Midlands and Oxford and Reading in the South East.

The South East is also popular with many seaside towns seeing rising numbers of rental properties.

Ten years ago, the picture was radically different and rental hotspots were centred on large parts of Devon and Cornwall, London and the west of Wales.

Housing
experts believe that although home-ownership will remain constant, more
people will have to rent for longer as it becomes increasingly 
difficult to raise a deposit.

Stephanie McMahon, Head of Research for Strutt & Parker said: 'The
private rental sector has changed dramatically over the past decade, 
and although this brings us more in line with our northern European 
peers we are still some way off the scale of the rental sector in 
countries like Germany and Switzerland. 

'In
our view it is likely that overall home ownership will remain between 
60 and 70 per cent over people’s lifetimes, but we will see much more 
openness to rental at different life stages and for longer time 
periods.'

She added: 'It is widely acknowledged that long-term
rental is increasingly common, driven by factors such as whether the 
younger generation are able to raise deposits to buy, or indeed the 
older generation releasing capital from their homes for care and 
pensions.

Capital bubble: There are a significant number of London boroughs where the rental increase has been dramatic with Barking and Dagenham seeing an increase of 230 per cent in 10 years

'The varied growth of this market across the UK clearly points 
to a need to understand local markets rather than just the big picture.'

Within London, a number of boroughs have seen an increase in the number of rented properties, such as Barking and Dagenham, which has seen an increase of 230 per cent in 10 years, and Tower Hamlets, which has seen a rise of more than 150 per cent. 

Traditionally established areas in prime central London such as Hammersmith and Fulham as well as Kensington and 
Chelsea have also seen increases of between 30 and 60 per cent.

Ms McMahon said: 'It is widely acknowledged that long-term renting is now immensely common for the younger generation and even more affluent older generations are exploring this different lifestyle option and seeing how much more they can get for their money in rental rather than committing to buying.'
