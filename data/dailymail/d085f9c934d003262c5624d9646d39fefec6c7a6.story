Transgender Sophie Husband, who once weighed 47 stones, today thanked taxpayers for funding the £28,000 gastric bypass that changed her life.

Losing 29 stones gave Sophie, 42 – who used to be a man called Bailey – the confidence become a woman.

And now the senior schoolteacher is looking forward to a £6,000 body lift to remove excess skin as well as a £10,000 sex change operation - also all paid for by the taxpayer.

But 6ft 1in Sophie claims her weight loss surgery – which cost more than double because she was so big her op needed extra medical staff and specialist equipment - is money well spent.

'I don't feel guilty,' she says of her NHS bill, which will eventually total almost £50,000, 'at 47 stones I was so big I was confined to bed. I had to rely on carers and benefits. Now I've saved the taxpayer money because losing weight meant I could go back to work.'

And Sophie, from Portsmouth, who sports a DD bust from taking female hormones, claims she is also entitled to gender reassignment surgery and a free body lift.

'Being born a woman in a man's body has been as traumatic as having cancer. And the saggy skin left from losing so much weight makes me sore so medically it needs to be removed.'

Meanwhile, she only ate so much because her gender issues – which began when she was aged 11 - were not recognised when she was at school.

'At primary school I had difficulty making friends,' says Sophie who grew up with parents Ken, 69, a retired chemist, mother Pearl, 68, a retired financial administrator and sister Alice, 32, 'at the time I didn't realise why but in hindsight I didn't identify with boys and all their talk about cars and football.

'I was always interested in make up and clothes with the girls. I cried when I couldn't go with the girls for talks about periods. It was then I knew I'd been born into the wrong body.'

But she was so ashamed of how she felt that she didn't confide in anyone. 'I knew my parents would be horrified,' she says, 'and then I'd never even heard of anyone wanting to change gender.'

Her secret led her to comfort eat. 'As a child I was slim but from the age of 13 I ate huge portions. As well as a cooked breakfast and school dinner, I would buy chips to eat on the way home from school. Then after a home cooked tea I'd sneak downstairs and make myself bacon butties.'

The weight soon piled on. 'Aged 13 I weighed 13 stones and from then on I put on at least a stone a year.'

Sophie says she is grateful to the NHS for her new life. 'I know I've been lucky to have had tens of thousands of pounds of treatment spent on me but I'm proof it is money well spent'

Aged 15 and 15st, Sophie's mother took her to see her GP. 'I was referred to a dietician who told me to cut back on my portion sizes. But no-one addressed the real problem of why I was eating – because I was so unhappy being in a man's body.'

By the age of 18, Sophie was so depressed she was on antidepressants.

Meanwhile, after leaving school, she had trained to become an electrician. But her weight soared so much she became too heavy to climb a ladder or squeeze into tiny spaces and had to give up work.

Sophie decided to become a teacher, going to university to do a teaching degree. However, her weight continued to soar.

'By the age of 24 I weighed around 26 stones. I'd start the day with a big fried breakfast, followed by chips, sausage rolls, fish and chips in curry sauce, eight bottles of lager, and then more take aways. I just ate all the time.'

During her twenties she married twice – but both the marriages only lasted a couple of years.

'The first marriage was when I was 22 and met Amanda as a pen pal. But aged 24 we'd split up. Second time around I married another woman but again divorced after just two years.

'Looking back I just married because I longed to be normal. I thought getting married would make me happy but instead it made me realise how unhappy I was.'

After her divorces, Sophie moved to be near with her parents who were living in the Isle of Man.

However, by the age of 30, she weighed 47 stones and was unable to work or care for herself.

'Although I had my own cottage, I was forced to claim benefits because I was too fat to work. I couldn't even get out of bed or wash myself properly. Instead, I laid in bed all day, occasionally venturing out on a disabled scooter.

'A home help came in to wash and clean twice a day. Meanwhile mum would bring in food. I'd beg for takeaways. If she refused to get them then I'd order them in instead. As well as meals of sandwiches, and packets of crisps, I adored pizza or Chinese food. I just ate all day.'

It was during this time that Sophie, who was still on antidepressants, went for a counselling session one day and as her usual doctor was away, saw another.

'It was speaking with him I realised that the reason why I was so fat and wasting my life was because I was so unhappy I was a man.'

Sophie was referred to the gender clinic at Charing Cross Hospital and after consultations, Sophie was diagnosed with gender dysmorphia.

However, before she could take hormones or have a sex change operation, she would have to lose weight.

'My doctor had recently said if I didn't stop eating I would only have a year to live. With no exercise I was a heart attack waiting to happen and I was heading for diabetes. As I had so much weight to lose it was decided the best option would be a gastric bypass.'

Sophie had to lose four stones first – which she did by drinking slimming shakes and just eating one meal a day.  'I was so desperate to start my sex change treatment that for the first time in my life I felt I really had a future to look forward to and wanted to lose weight. However it took me six months to lose that four stones and by the end my weight was starting to edge up again. So I knew I'd never be able to lose so much weight just by dieting.'

'I don't feel guilty,' Sophie says of her NHS bill, which will eventually total almost £50,000

Aged 37 she was booked in for the gastric bypass - which works by removing some of the digestive system so food isn't so easily absorbed - at The Spire hospital in Macclesfield.

She says: 'The doctor said due to my weight it was 50/50 whether or not I'd survive the operation. A week before I confessed to my parents I was doing it because I wanted to change sex.

'Both mum and dad were horrified, especially my mum. They had no idea I was having the gastric bypass so I could become a woman. Mum didn't speak with me for months because she was so shocked and upset. She kept saying perhaps I was just gay or going through a phase. She couldn't understand it.'

Fortunately the four hour operation went well. 'For the first six months I could only eat shakes and sugar free ice lollies but I lost nine stones.

'And within ten months I'd lost 12 stones and begun to eat mashed food.'

Sophie decided to move to London, where she would be close to Charing Cross hospital for her gender reassignment treatment. Win weeks she landed a teaching job and started hormones.

'I was thrilled with the results - a waist and hips plus a DD bust. I've since had laser treatment to remove facial stubble, grown my hair long and bought new feminine clothes.'

She now weighs 18 stones and is on the waiting list for a full gender reassignment operation, which involves making a vagina from the penis.

'Luckily my mum has now come round. For my birthday recently she even sent me a daughter birthday card. She realises now although I've changed sex I am still the same person.'

Because Sophie has so much flabby skin, she qualifies for medical reasons for a total body lift. 'Right now I get lots of infections in between the flaps of skin which are really painful. I can't wait to have it all removed.

'I hope to lose a little more weight, probably going down from a size 18 to 20 dress size to a size 16, and then after my skin removal op, I will be having my sex change.'

As she is a supply teacher she moves from school to school. She says: 'Luckily I've never had that awkward moment when I've left one term as sir and returned the next as Miss.

'And people rarely seem to guess I even used to be a man.'

She still hopes to find love – with a woman. 'There is someone I speak to regularly,' she says, 'we met online and she lives abroad. So it's early days yet in our relationship but I would adore to settle down with a woman.'

Meanwhile, she is grateful to the NHS for her new life. 'I know I've been lucky to have had tens of thousands of pounds of treatment spent on me but I'm proof it is money well spent.'
