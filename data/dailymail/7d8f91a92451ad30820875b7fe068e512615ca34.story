Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius struggled to fend off the latest round of barbs in a Capitol Hill hearing on Wednesday, following revelations that fewer than 365,000 Americans have enrolled for medical insurance through government-run marketplaces – including a federal website that will ultimate cost $677 million.

Two months into a six-month open enrollment period that the federal government expected to generate 7 million signups, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services aimed to attract about 1.2 million new insurance customers, according to a September memo released by the House Ways and Means Committee.

But as of Nov. 30, just over 137,200 Americans had chosen insurance policies through the perennially afflicted healthcare.gov. And nearly another 227,500 enrolled through the 14 state-run insurance exchanges, whose websites have experienced fewer problems.

That puts the government about 835,000 enrollments – or 70 per cent – behind its intermediate target.

The pace of enrollment accelerated in November, compared with an even more anemic October rollout that produced just 106,000 new sign-ups.

HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius made her final congressional appearance of 2013 on Wednesday, giving Republicans another chance to grill her on Obamacare's lackluster performance

White House deputy press secretary Josh Earnest has tried to shift reporters' focus away from the overall enrollment numbers, and toward the thorny question of how many young, healthy Americans the administration can attract to Obamacare

But the Obama administration isn't saying how many, or how few, of those enrollees have paid premiums. Americans who want their insurance coverage to kick in on January 1 must make their first month's payments by December 23. The final deadline for 2014 policies is March 31.

Sebelius declined to say Wednesday how many people have paid those premiums.

State-based health insurance marketplaces have far outperformed the federal government's effort, which has been fraught with technical disasters and delays

'Some may have paid. Some may not,' she told Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Joe Pitts. 'We're giving you the enrollment numbers.'

White House Deputy Press Secretary Joshua Earnest hinted to reporters on Wednesday that the Obama administration is no longer focusing on recruiting a specific number of Americans to enroll, focusing instead on balancing the ratio of young, healthy participants with those who are older and more prone to illness.

'What we need is the right mix of individuals in these exchanges,' Earnest said.

An additional 1.94 million people have registered for accounts on healthcare.gov and learned their eligibility to enroll, the administration announced Wednesday, but none of them has chosen an insurance plan and there's no indication that they will.

More than 800,000 have been declared 
eligible for state-administered Medicaid coverage as a result of 
shopping on healthcare.gov. Critics point to the number as evidence that
the Obamacare system will produce far more government dependents than 
private insurance buyers.

West Virginia,
for example, has seen 75,000 new Medicaid enrollments but just 1,200 
new private insurance customers – a ratio of 60-to-1 – according to 
state insurance commissioner Nancy Adkins.

Under
withering questioning from Rep. Pitts, Sebelius acknowledged that if 
HHS were stalled at 365,000 enrollments by the end of December, it would
be 3 million short of its goal.

'That is correct, sir,' she said.

But the federal government insists that enrollment rates have continued to rise during the first one-third of December.

'Evidence
of the technical improvements to healthcare.gov can be seen in the 
enrollment numbers,' Sebelius told the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee on Wednesday.

Tennessee Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn grilled Sebelius on the healthcare.gov website's cost, demanding to know how many taxpayer dollars have been committee to the project's IT costs, and how much of that has already been spent.

The Obama administration, the secretary replied, 
has 'obligated $677 million' so far, including funds allocated to fix the site's numerous flaws. And $319 million of 
that total has already gone out the door, she said.

Blackburn also railed against the administration's habit of using quiet holiday news cycles to announce a pair of new Obamacare delays.

In one, the
administration announced on July 3 that a so-called employer mandate would be pushed back by one year. In another, the day before Thanksgiving brought news of a one-year delay for the online small-business insurance exchange.

'What new delays will be coming on Christmas Eve and New Year's?' Blackburn snarked.

Michael Hash, the director of HHS's Office of Health Reform, told reporters during a conference call that 'we think we're on track and we will reach the total that we thought. We're only two and a half months into a six-month open-enrollment period.'

'As many more Americans learn about the options available to them at the marketplace,' Hash said, 'we have every reason to believe interest will continue to grow and enrollment will continue to rise.'

Alan Cohen, the chief strategy officer at Liazon, a firm that provides health exchanges to private employees, told USA Today that the government's numbers have been 'stunningly, dramatically below expectations.'

Republicans have continued to hammer away at the White House and HHS over healthcare.gov's performance, including concerns about its capacity for paying insurance companies once Americans purchase their new policies.

Not impressed: Expressions from House Energy and Commerce Committee members Bill Cassidy, Brett Guthrie and Morgan Griffith were typical of Wednesday's duel between Sebelius and her Republican detractors

In theory, the website's 'back end' financial processing system also allows consumers to sign up directly with health insurance companies, but government officials have testified in previous hearings that large portions of it have yet to be built.

The GOP has also focused attention on the 5.5 million American consumers who have received cancellation letters from their insurers since the Oct. 1 start of Obamacare's open enrollment period.

'Far too many Americans who were happy and satisfied with their healthcare coverage on January 1st of this year have had the worlds turned upside down,' Michigan Republican Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan said during the committee hearing, which he chaired.

Sebelius, however, insisted Wednesday that 'a lot of individuals who received cancellation notices are thrilled with the choices that are now available to them' through healthcare.gov.

The most recent national opinion survey, released Tuesday by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, shows that just 34 per cent of Americans now approve of the job President Barack Obama is doing on the health care issue.
