A Missouri man was shot dead by his wife after a loaded gun accidentally went off at a dinner party on Saturday night.

David Utz, 43, died from a single shot to the chest after his wife, named locally as Jessica, picked up a gun without realizing it was loaded.

The couple, who have a young daughter, were showing guests their guns as they entertained friends in their Imperial, Jefferson County home.

Mr Utz is believed to have loaded a gun and put it back down again while his wife was out of the room. When she returned, she picked the gun up and somehow managed to fire it.

She had no idea it was loaded, Captain Ron Arnhart, of the sheriff's office, told the St Louis Post-Dispatch, adding: 'It does appear to be a horrible accident.'

Police are investigating the shooting, and the prosecutor's office has not yet said if Mrs Utz will be charged.

In two other cases of accidental shootings in the area last year, involuntary manslaughter charges were brought against those claiming they had never meant to shoot their victims.

Makanzie Halinski, 20, who allegedly 
shot Cole Campbell, 20, in the head with a gun she thought was not 
loaded, and Keith Wildharber, 21, who accidentally shot his roommate 
after believing he had removed ammunition from a pistol, are both 
awaiting trial.
