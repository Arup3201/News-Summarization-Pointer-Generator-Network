A mom has been reunited with her three-year-old son four days after his father attacked her using pepper spray and a stun gun before taking him to Canada.

Brandy Turner's son Luke was taken by his father Monty Turner on Saturday after he broke into the family home in Longmont, Colorado. 

The kidnapping led to an Amber Alert this weekend that spanned several states.

The 51-year-old was arrested Sunday in Brandon, Manitoba, and jailed on suspicion of kidnapping, burglary and assault. A hearing regarding his status in the country was held Tuesday.

Emotions: At a news conference late Tuesday, Brandy Turner said she felt terror and disbelief after her son was taken, then anxiousness trying to figure out how to get her son home

Longmont police expect that Monty Turner will be back in Colorado to face charges in anywhere from five days to three weeks.

A spokeswoman for the Boulder County district attorney said Monty Turner could contest extradition, which would delay his facing charges in Colorado.

Monty Turner had been prohibited by court order from making contact with Luke or Brandy Turner.

Authorities
say Turner hid in his wife's garage in Longmont, Colorado, and attacked
her about 10am Saturday when she stepped outside to smoke a cigarette. 

He forced his way into the house after she fled inside and tried to call 911, according to court documents.

Brandy Turner told police she saw her husband in the backyard Saturday morning, when she stepped outside to smoke a cigarette. She said she went inside, locked the door and tried to call 911, but Monty Turner forced his way in

Brandy Turner said her son cried 
'Don't hurt my mommy!' as he watched his father shock her with a Taser 
and then blasted her in the face with pepper spray, according to the Longmont Times-Call.

Turner
told reports that she fought her husband, whom she is in the process of
divorcing, but that the weapons allowed him to overpower her.

Monty Turner took the couple's son as he ate breakfast at the kitchen table.

Soon after, Brandy Turner said she went 
into another room to attempt to call 911 again, and she saw Monty Turner
leaving on a bicycle with Luke.

A judge had issued a permanent 
protection order barring Monty Turner from being within 100 feet of his 
wife or his son after he kidnapped the boy for five months last July.

Police
later found him hiding out with the boy in a cabin 100 miles from 
Longmont and returned the young child to his mother in March. Because 
Monty had legal custody of Luke at the time, he was never arrested. 
However, a judge later stripped Monty of custody. 

Brandy Turner said her estranged 
husband demanded to see his son again when he confronted her on 
Saturday. He became violent when she wouldn't allow it.

Police searched for Monty Turner and little Luke after the kidnapping, but were unable to locate the car the father escaped in.

Cross-country: The case sprawled many hundreds of miles from Luke Turner's home in Longmont, Colorado

Located: The FBI and Canadian police arrested Turner at the Casablanca Motor Inn in Brandon, Manitoba, Canada, after tracking Turner through his credit card purchases

When
they contacted Turner's brother, the reluctantly told authorities that 
Turner had been living in Denver with his father, Ronald Turner, and 
that the two planned to flee to Springfield, Missouri - some 800 miles 
away from Longmont, according to the Times-Call.

The brother told authorities that Monty Turner planned the attack in order to get his son back.

On
Sunday morning, Missouri State Highway Patrol troopers pulled over 
Monty's father Ronald Turner, 72, driving his son's car near 
Springfield.

Monty and
little Luke were nowhere to be found, but authorities discovered toys 
in the car. Ronald Turner denied helping Monty, but was arrested for 
being complicit in the kidnapping.

Hours later, the FBI located Monty Turner at a roadside motel in Manitoba, Canada, after tracking his credit card purchases. 

Local authorities and the FBI arrested Monty Turner and recovered Luke.

Brandy
Turner could not go to Canada to pick up her child because she 
did not have a passport. 

At a news conference late Tuesday, Brandy Turner said she felt terror and disbelief after her son was taken, then anxiousness trying to figure out how to get her son home. With Luke sitting calmly on her lap Tuesday, Brandy Turner said she felt relief.
