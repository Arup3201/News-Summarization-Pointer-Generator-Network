A SECRET cache of letters exposing intimate details of the scandalous Victorian love triangle involving Scottish aristocrat Effie Gray are being put up for auction.

The letters by prominent art critic John Ruskin expose the torment behind the story of his doomed marriage to Perth-born Gray and her affair with his one-time friend, the Pre-Raphaelite artist John Everett Millais.

Gray and Ruskin were married for five years but the marriage was never consummated due to Ruskin's disgust at some aspect of his wife's body.

Intimate letters show the scandalous affair of aristocrat Effie Gray (centre) with the artist John Everett Millais (right) , who was her husband John Ruskin's (left) friend. But Effie complained Ruskin refused to ever have sex with her during their five-year marriage over disgust at her body 

As Effie wrote to her father: 'He alleged various reasons, hatred to children, religious motives, a desire to preserve my beauty, and, finally this last year he told me his true reason... that he had imagined women were quite different to what he saw I was, and that the reason he did not make me his wife was because he was disgusted with my person the first evening.'

While married to Ruskin, Effie modeled for Millais' painting The Order of Release, in which she was depicted as the loyal wife of a Scottish rebel who has secured his release from prison.

She then became close to Millais when he accompanied her and Ruskin on a trip to Scotland in order to paint Ruskin's portrait. 

During this time, spent in Brig O'Turk in the Trossachs, they fell in love, and after her marriage to Ruskin was annulled, she then married Millais.

The love triangle has long captured the public imagination and it was recently made into the Hollywood film Effie Gray, directed by Oscar-winning actress Emma Thompson and starring Dakota Fanning and Greg Wise.

Of the collection of 75 letters signed by Ruskin, 37 are previously unpublished. 

The collection comprises 75 letters signed by Ruskin, of which 37 are previously unpublished. They are expected to fetch up to £40,000 ($64,156) when they go under the hammer next month 

They provide an uncensored insight into the dark heart of Ruskin's blackest years, showing his remorse, anguish and anger. 

The letters are expected to fetch up to £40,000 ($64,156) when they go under the hammer.

Although written to a priest, many of Ruskin's letters digress from the subjects of the Church and the Lord's Prayer, instead imparting the distressed confessions of a man lamenting the folly of his younger self.

He wrote: 'I married like a fool, because a girl's face pleased me. She married me for my money, breaking her faith to a poor lover.'

Effie Gray's broken-hearted lover was just one whose life was ruined by contact with the ill-fated marriage.

In another letter from the collection, Ruskin makes reference to Rose La Touche, the student he subsequently fell in love with, and tells how his split from Effie corrupted his later relationship.

He writes: '...in the last ten years, and especially in the last year, my life has been set on a cast - and that of a righteous girl with it. - And both are destroyed.'

But the profound misery which is evident in these letters is matched by a hard vindictiveness, hinted at in a 'wretch' and 'who had been my friend, once.'

One letter betrays the ruthlessness of its writer as he informs Malleson: 'The first condition of my keeping friends with anybody is that when I ask them to do a thing, they should do it.

'If - without showing just reason - they twice give me trouble to ask twice, I have done with them.'

Matthew Haley, head of the Bonhams book department, said: 'These letters are a vivid reminder that there was passion and tumult underneath the outward formality of the Victorians. 

'Here we see the bitterness and regret that haunted Ruskin throughout his life.'

As well as providing the inspiration for the new Hollywood film Effie Gray, the Victorian love-triangle scandal was the focus of the 1912 silent film The Love of John Ruskin, the 1975 BBC series The Love School starring Peter Egan, and numerous stage plays.

The letters will be auctioned at Bonhams Fine Books, Atlases, Manuscripts and Photographs sale in London on November 12.
