Dutch TV analyst Pierre van Hooijdonk told a Mexican supporter to ‘shut the **** up’ in a row over the Arjen Robben cheating storm.

Van Hooijdonk, who was at Holland’s World Cup training base at Flamengo, was livid with claims Robben had deliberately conned the referee to win a penalty.

Robben admitted he tried to win a penalty during Holland’s 2-1 victory over Mexico to set up a quarter-final showdown with Costa Rica in Salvador.

Language! Dutchman Pierre van Hooijdonk told a Mexican supporter to 'shut the **** up' after the last-16 clash

Admission: Arjen Robben has confessed to diving during the first half of Holland's victory over Mexico

Turning point: Robben's left foot is clipped by the boot of Mexico defender Rafael Marquez

Theatrics: Robben fell under the challenge but his reaction was what convinced the referee

VIDEO 'Honest' Arjen has clear conscience

The Dutch flyer didn’t finish their 55-minute training session and Robin van Persie also left with heavy tape around his left leg. Both are expected to be fit for Saturday’s clash.

Van Hooijdonk, who played for Nottingham Forest and Celtic during a colourful career in Britain, said: ‘I told the Mexican to ‘shut the **** up over the dive because it annoyed me.

‘I said “did you watch the first half as well when he went in and he should have had in one movement two penalties and he didn't get it?". 

‘Everyone forgets that. It's a thing a cloud comes above him when he should be in the sun because he has been tremendous for us.

‘You know what, I sometimes hate this. I was on the plane sitting next to a Mexican and he showed us his friend blah blah blah... and I said “what is the problem?”

‘He said “he dived for the penalty” and i said “no, he didn't dive for the penalty. He said that he dived early on in the game. And that was it. He was being honest. He was chatting like he was with his friends.’

Van Hooijdonk, who played for the Dutch national team in the nineties, was fiercely protective when he spoke about the Bayern Munich winger.

The former Forest striker, who believes Holland have the qualities to win the World Cup, claims Robben is the team’s biggest threat.

Van Hooijdonk added: ‘He is not only our star player by a little bit, but by a long way.

‘Everyone realised that we rely on Robben, Robin van Persie and Wesley Sneijder and that's a weakness as well because if these players are not on form, we struggle. 

‘But Robben is destroying everyone at the moment. Everyone says when he was younger he was selfish. 

‘This player now captains Holland (when van Persie is off the pitch), then wins the penalty, walks with the ball and Dirk Kuyt tells him put it in.

‘Then Robben looks at Klaas Jan Huntelaar and he thinks: he has fresh legs - here you go do that.  ‘When I was at Benfica I saw someone beat two players in the box, went down grabbed the ball and went to the penalty spot. 

‘I had already scored five but he took the ball and said "I will take it because they made a foul on me." Yes, **** off you.’

Problem: Robin van Persie left the Holland training session in Flamengo early on Wednesday afternoon

Holland threw open the doors to their Flamengo training centre yesterday for a full practice session ahead of preparations for the quarter-final clash with Costa Rica.

Sneijder, who was outstanding during Holland’s run to the 2010 World Cup final against Spain, began the session training alone.

The Galatasaray midfielder has been struggling with a back injury, but Louis van Gaal is convinced he will be fit.

Robben finished the session early and van Persie walked to the team coach with tap around his left leg clearly visible.

Van Gaal needs all three players to be fit for the clash with Costa Rica on Saturday at the Arena Fonte Nova in Salvador.
