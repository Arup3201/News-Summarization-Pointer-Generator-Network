It has been declared the world's longest pub crawl and two friends have celebrated in the appropriate way - with a pint.

Peter Hill, 59, and John Drew, 61, said cheers as they stopped at their 18,000th pub after a 30-year tour and vowed to carry on boozing 'until our livers give out.'

The group - who call themselves the Black Country Ale Tairsters - started visiting different watering holes in 1984 after becoming bored of always visiting the same pub.

Along with friends, they have drunk in a different pub every week since then - beginning back when a pint cost just 64p.

Girls are banned from tagging along with them on their trips, which have taken in bars in every county in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

The gang always wear homemade uniforms on each night out made of waistcoats fashioned from old beer towels.

They also hold the record for being the first to travel to pubs around the entire coastline of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Last year they completed a seven-year quest to visit every pub in Wales after stopping off at all 3,905 of them.

They have also been to every boozer in 11 Midlands counties and have driven over 250,000 miles during their monster trip, during which they've downed at least 36,000 pints.

But there will be one notable absentee from the celebrations after Peter's dad Joe, who had been with the pint-supping pair throughout their adventure, died in April at the age of 83.

Founding member Peter said they came up with the idea after becoming bored with drinking in the same pub each week.

Machinist Peter, his retired dad Joe and scaffolder John then decided that the 800 Banks's pubs they visited weren't enough so embarked on the challenge to conquer every pub in Wales.

Speaking from the landmark 18,000th pub at The Saxon Penny in Lichfield, Staffs., Peter said: 'It's fabulous that we have made it to here.

'I think we'll stay at this pub for a while yet, but we may squeeze in number 18,001 later on this evening.

'If I had to have a beer of choice I would just ask for any real ale to be honest. It's hard to think of a hobby which is so much fun.

'We are just going to keep going until our livers give out, or at least something gives out.

The world's most epic pub crawl began with this map - and the dream of visiting bars in all counties in Britain

'Although it may be a big surprise to people, we're not massive drinkers. We just love pubs and everything about them.

'We have our own score cards which we fill in and we write the number of the pub on the card and ask the landlord to sign the book we have which has information in from every bar we go to.

'We also keep a record of the pubs we go to by taking a photo of the pub, inside and out, and make a note of anything special about the place.

'It turned from a bit of fun to a serious hobby. I'll be doing this for as long as I can - I intend to visit every pub I can.

'Although I'll soon be 60 and I wonder where all the years have gone.

'We would never live long enough to have a drink in every pub in England. It's taken us seven years to visit 3,905 pubs in Wales.

'Nowadays, I try to limit myself to 1,500 pints a year. If it's a cider and lager pub we'll just have a swift half.

In 2010, The Black Country Ale Tasters marked their 15,000th pub visit at the Watermill in Kidderminster

'In every pub, we ask for a £1 donation, with the money going to the children's ward at Sandwell Hospital.'

Around 20 tipplers were originally in the group but now only two remain including Peter, from West Bromwich, West Mids.

Every pub they visit is rated, photos are taken and information is noted down and Black Country Ale Tairsters (BATs) approval is a recognised accolade in the local pub trade.

They have also made trips to pubs right across Europe but they say these boozers don't count because they are not in the UK.

David Parsons, 67, owner of the Tame Bridge public house in Great Bridge, West Mids., which is one of the team's favourite locals, said: 'These men are incredible, they are such a presence in the pub here.

'They have changed this pub, we used to serve a lot of lager but since they started coming with the knowledge they have of real ales, we sell a lot of the stuff.

'What they don't know about beer, no one does.'
