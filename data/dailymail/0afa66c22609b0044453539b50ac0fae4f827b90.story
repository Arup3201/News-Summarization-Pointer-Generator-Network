Nigella Lawson asked for nothing but the contents of her kitchen after her bitter split from Charles Saatchi.

The TV chef, 53, who divorced the art dealer last year, got her fishmongers to remove her cooking appliances according to friend Nathaniel Goldberg.

In fact he says Nigella threw a party for those who 
helped her through her difficult year including lawyers, her agent, 
make-up artist - and, yes, the fishmonger.

Nigella told the Mail last year: 'One of the people I follow avidly on Twitter is my local fishmonger. I see what his catch is then I direct-message him with my order and waddle over and get it.'

Currently the only dealer in fish the mother-of-two appears to follow is Rex Goldsmith of the Chelsea Fishmonger.

Photographer Nathaniel, who shot Nigella's Vogue cover, told the magazine she
 found the riches that came with being part of a society couple with 
Saatchi, 70, difficult to deal with.

And so the mother-of two wanted no other material 
possessions than the contents of her beloved kitchen, report the Mirror.

'She adores the indulgences in life - good food, good face cream, good bed linen. But she's not spoilt,' said Nathaniel.

'The
 very fact she walked away from her marriage without asking for anything
 other than the contents of her kitchen is testament to that.'

Nathaniel also said Nigella is 
finally getting back to normal and starting to enjoying life again after
 the storm surrounding the divorce.

According
 to him the domestic goddess 'felt an incredible sense of comfort' after
 throwing an impromptu dinner party recently, and said she is 'able to 
take pleasure from things again'.

He said Nigella's life changed dramatically in the 13 years after meeting Saatchi at The Ivy in April 2000, and that she became anxious and isolated.

He said: 'They clearly adored each other but the atmosphere always depended on his mood. And his mood was variable.

'Hers was no longer the house you just dropped into and Charles was not one to sit around the kitchen table cracking jokes.'
