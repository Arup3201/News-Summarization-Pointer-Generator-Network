Details of the final terrifying hours of workers held hostage by terrorists at an Algerian gas plant have been revealed, as footage emerged of the site two weeks after the crisis unfolded in the Sahara desert.

At least 38 foreign workers - including six Britons - died at the facility, which is part operated by BP, after it was over-run by heavily-armed terrorists on Wednesday January 16.

The Algerian general manager of the site has told how between eight and 10 western hostages had been tied to metalwork at a gas construction complex on Thursday January 17, while the hostage-takers - some clad in suicide vests - set about building a bomb.

Damage: The damage was evident as the Algerian government opened the desert gas plant for the first time following the four-day siege which saw dozens of workers slaughtered by militants

Lofti Benadouda said: 'There was one big explosion and we saw the fire burning all night.'

According to a report in the Daily Telegraph
Mr Benadouda said the hostages had been chained to the metalwork at 
varying heights; some at ground level close to the car containing the 
bomb, others further up.

'The terrorists wanted a big explosion. They wanted to destroy the plant and make a big impression,' he said.

The manager, who was used by the 
militants to relay messages between them and Algerian forces surrounding
the site, said that when he 
attended the plant to try and identify the bodies of his colleagues, the
sights he witnessed suggested three terrorists had detonated suicide 
vests.

Mr Benadouda said a Norwegian and possibly a Briton were among the dead following the explosion.

BBC video footage shows the now heavily-guarded facility 
still bears the signs of the carnage wrought by terrorists during the four-day siege two weeks 
ago, from bullet-holes visible in the walls of the employees' living 
quarters, to the machinery blackened by fire and explosions.

Aftermath: The site was opened to western media for the first time since dozens of foreign workers were killed during a four day stand-off that ended in a bloody showdown between militants and Algerian forces

Explosion: The manager of the site has described how a group of western hostages were tied to metalwork at a central gas processing facility by militants wearing suicide vests

The militants, who called themselves
the Signatories in Blood Battalion, stormed the 37-acre site on January
16, attacking two buses carrying employees and killing two, before 
driving to the main facility where they took hostages.

The following day saw more bloodshed when Algerian forces attacked as the militants tried to move the hostages.

The
plant was surrounded by Algerian military on Friday January 18, who 
moved in the following day amid reports the terrorists were killing 
hostages.

The Algerian prime minister later announced that at least 38 civilians had been killed during the course of the siege.

Security: The manager wants to see a military presence maintained at the site in the Sahara when the plant resumes producing gas

Manager: Lofti Benadouda has called for a permanent military presence at In Amenas

Scottish father-of-two Kenneth Whiteside, a planning manager at In Amenas who died at the hands of the militant hostage-takers a fortnight ago, was buried in Fife yesterday.

His family has said he was 'lined up and shot dead' alongside three other hostages at the Algerian gas plant.

Among the other UK nationals killed were 46-year-old security expert Paul Morgan, systems supervisor Garry Barlow, 49, from Liverpool, and 26-year-old engineer and father of one Sebastian John.
