A New Jersey woman unable to afford gender reassignment surgery is planning a move to Britain so she can claim the operation for free on the taxpayer-funded NHS.

Giana Lopez, 25, has been taking female hormones for the past four years and has had an operation to have her testicles removed, but is unable to afford full reassignment surgery under the costly U.S. healthcare system.

She is now planning a move to the UK where she will qualify to receive the surgery under the NHS after working for 12 months, The Sun reported.

At age 18, she came out to friends and family as gay - but three years later, decided to transition, according to the paper.

The makeup artist, who runs her own YouTube channel, is currently applying for jobs in London. She could have the option of receiving a two-year working visa or being employed by a U.S. company which can transfer her to its British offices.

She said that, aside from Canada the British NHS healthcare system offered the best deal for receiving the treatment.

'If I live in the UK for a year I can get the free surgery,' she said. 'I know the good people of Britain won't mind funding my dream - I need it just as much as anyone else.'

The surgery, which would cost between £15,000 and £20,000 in the U.S., is provided  for any individual who is already entitled to free treatment on the NHS.

She added: 'The UK's free healthcare entitles me to this, so of course I'm going to take up the opportunity.'

MailOnline has requested comment from the NHS.

Meanwhile, the NHS' top doctor claims the service is 'not fit for the future' and unless it undergoes radical change may be forced to abandon free healthcare for all.

Medical director of NHS England Professor Sir Bruce Keogh said the NHS must become far less reliant on hospitals and needed a ‘complete transformation’ of the way it operates.

In order for the NHS to keep itself sustainable, he said, more services need to happen under the same roof – for example diagnostics tests and an expanded range of treatments at GP surgeries.

Sir Bruce told The Guardian: ‘If not, we will get to a place where the NHS becomes unaffordable and we will have to make some very difficult decisions which will get to the very heart of the principle of the NHS and its values.

‘This will open up a whole series of discussions about whether the NHS is fit for purpose, whether it’s affordable, and whether the compact with the citizen of free healthcare for all is sustainable in the longer term.’

He added: ‘Too many patients find the NHS fragmented (and) confusing. They find that they get pushed from pillar to post; they feel like a ball in a pinball machine at times.’
