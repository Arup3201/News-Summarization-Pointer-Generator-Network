Colombian drug trafficker Daniel Barrera aka 'El Loco' is escorted by policemen before being deported to the United States at the Antinarcotics Police Airport in Bogota on Tuesday

Colombian drug kingpin Daniel Barrera made his first appearance in a U.S. court on Wednesday and pleaded not guilty to conspiring to import cocaine into the United States.

Prosecutors have described the 44-year-old Barrera - nicknamed ‘El Loco’ or ‘the madman’ - as one of the largest cocaine distributors in history.

They have amassed a wealth of evidence against the cosmetically enhanced drug lord, who allegedly had several plastic surgeries and tried to burn off his fingerprints with acid to mask his identity.

Ruben Oliva, his lawyer, said Barrera would demand a trial by jury and denied his client had the surgeries.

Prosecutors
allege that Barrera laundered tens of millions of dollars of profits as
he processed about 30,000 kilograms of raw cocaine into cocaine powder 
each month since 1998.

He
conspired with others to distribute cocaine ‘knowing and intending’ 
that some would be imported into the United States, Assistant U.S. 
Attorney Jenna Dabbs said at the hearing in Manhattan federal court.

Barrera,
with a light beard and wearing jeans and a black-and-white golf shirt, 
spoke briefly in Spanish at the hearing, confirming his attorney and 
that he understood the proceedings.

U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein said Barrera would remain in detention. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.

The U.S. Treasury Department in March 2010 put Barrera on its list of most-wanted Colombian narcotics traffickers.

Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has called Barrera ‘the last of the great capos.’

He was arrested last September in Venezuela. He was then sent to Colombia, where the U.S. pursued his extradition.

Venezuelan officials say they confiscated houses, ranches, a yacht, apartments and 48 cars from Barrera, U.S. authorities said.

Barrera arrived in the United States on Tuesday after being extradited from Colombia.

He is accused of buying raw cocaine paste from the leftist rebel group FARC and processing it in laboratories in areas controlled by the now-demobilized paramilitary group the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, or AUC.

The AUC collected monthly taxes from Barrera, according to the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's indictment, and he is accused of giving money to fund terrorist groups, including the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC.

Evidence against Barrera includes photographs and other documents related to the seizures of cocaine shipments off the coasts of Venezuela and Florida, Dabbs told Hellerstein.

In 2000 Barrera provided 1.4 tons of cocaine to an unnamed co-conspirator in Guatemala via a ‘go-fast boat,’ according to the indictment.

Barrera is alleged to have laundered tens of millions of dollars of profits as he processed about 30,000 kilograms of raw cocaine into cocaine powder each month since 1998

He also provided cocaine to the same co-conspirator to be hidden in a container of scrap metal that was being transported to Mexico from Panama in 2004, the indictment said.

Barrera was arrested in Venezuela last September with the help of authorities there as well as British and U.S. intelligence agencies.

Colombian authorities had been closing in on his organization in the weeks before his arrest, detaining 36 suspected members and seizing five tons of cocaine.

Barrera's next appearance in Manhattan federal court is set for September 4. He also faces charges in federal court in Brooklyn and Miami.
