There's nothing worse than being frozen out by your hosts when you book to stay somewhere.  

But that's exactly what one enterprising Airbnb user is offering his guests after he built an igloo in his back garden and advertised it for rent. 

The man, called Pierre on the accommodation website, is offering the unusual lodgings behind his Cambridgeport, Massachusetts, home for just $10, or £7, a night - providing you bring your own sleeping bag.  

The igloo is built from snow left over from storm Juno, which swept across the northeastern US last week

Snug: The accommodation comes with a tarpaulin and yoga mat, but you'll need your own sleeping bag

And the trilingual host has already had some takers, with the igloo booked up on February 7 and 18. 

The advert claims the snowy haunt can accommodate two people and with nighttime temperatures in Cambridgeport dropping as low as -18C this week, they best snuggle up together for warmth.

The igloo is built from snow left over by storm Juno which swept the northeastern United States last week, dumping more than 24in of the white stuff on nearby Boston.

Pierre, who claims to have perfected his igloo-building skills on a recent trip to Siberia, writes on the listing: 'This is an igloo. Yes. It is very cool. Juno made it.

'Comfortably fits 1, or 2 if curled up. You can use the house bathroom and kitchen if you need. Tarp and yoga mattress provided. You'll need to bring your sleeping bag.

'Wunderbar.' 

Pierre has already had two bookings for his igloo, despite temperatures plunging to -18C in Cambridgeport
