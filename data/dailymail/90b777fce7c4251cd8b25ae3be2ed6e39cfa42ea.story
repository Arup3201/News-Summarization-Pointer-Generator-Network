David Beckham's wife, Victoria, has lead tributes to her husband after he announced his retirement from football and said they are looking forward to new adventures as a family.

In a statement, the 39-year-old said the couple are 'excited about the next chapter in our lives'.

She has been following David around the world as he played for club and country, ever since they met at charity football match in 1997.

Victoria said today: 'The children
and I are so proud of David, it's been an incredible journey for us all
as we have watched him play at clubs all over the world throughout the 
last 15 years.

'Myself and the children have cheered 
him from the stands, as he has held high trophies with his teams at 
Manchester United, Real Madrid, AC Milan, LA Galaxy and Paris St 
Germain.

'This was not an easy decision to 
make, and to me and the children he will always be an amazing sportsman 
and a devoted husband and father.

'He is, and will always remain, a true
ambassador for sport and is not just an inspiration to myself and our 
children but for millions of people worldwide.

'We are all excited about the next chapter in our lives and the adventures we will explore as a family.'

Celebrity superstars: Victoria and David, pictured together in 2007, have drawn attention in every country they have brought their family

The former Spice Girl was already 
famous in her own right, but as a couple, the pair dubbed 'Posh and 
Becks' were catapulted to international celebrity A-listers after they 
married in 1999.

The fashion icon has been 
constantly photographed supporting her husband from the stands as he 
played for club and country around the world.

The
attention drawn by Victoria and other wives and girlfriends of England 
footballers including Cheryl Cole and Coleen Rooney, led to the coining 
of the term WAGs at the World Cup in 2006.

And many viewed Victoria, as wife of the England captain, as 'Queen of the WAGs'.

She has had an undoubted influence over her husband's career, not least on the club's he has decided to play for.

When David left Manchester United to signed for Real Madrid in 2003, Victoria eventually followed a year later and they enrolled son Brooklyn in an international school.

But it proved to be one of the couple's most difficult periods.

During his time alone in Spain, Beckham was forced to deny claims that he had been involved in a four-month affair with his former PA Rebecca Loos.

Mrs Beckham later said of the 2004 scandal: ‘It was a really tough time. But the fact is we’ve come out of everything we’ve been through stronger and happier.'

New chapter: The Beckham family, pictured in Los Angeles, will be hoping to spend more time together now David has retired from football

Four years later, the family moved again when David signed for LA Galaxy based in the United States in a five-year deal.

There was speculation that the move would put an end to Beckham's England career, but in a bid to prove his continued commitment to international football he returned to Europe with two loan spells at AC Milan during the off-season.

In recent years the couple have been increasingly based back in London, with David training sporadically with Arsenal.

In January the 38-year-old announced he would be joining Paris St Germain in a five-month loan deal.

However, the Beckham brood remained in London as the children had started new schools.

After announcing his retirement, David will now be hoping to see more of Victoria and their four children Brooklyn, Romeo, Harper and Cruz.
