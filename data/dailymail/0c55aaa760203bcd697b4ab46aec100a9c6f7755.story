A letter in which a famous philosopher suggested Britain should welcome Adolf Hitler if he wanted to start World War Two could fetch £300 at auction.

Bertrand Russell, who won the Noble Prize in Literature, said the Government ought to treat any invading German as a guest and give them hospitality.

And he said the then Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin should dine with the leader of the German forces.

Russell, a pacifist and humanitarian, wrote that going to war with Germany would only see the victor inherit the bad traits of the losing side and make the world a poorer place

Russell, a pacifist and humanitarian, wrote that going to war with Germany would only see the victor inherit the bad traits of the losing side and make the world a poorer place.

The letter was written by Russell in May 1937, two years before the start of World War Two and the Nazi Blitzgreig of western Europe.

The two page letter is now coming up for sale at Dominic Winter Auctions in Cirencester Gloucester.

Russell, who was sent to prison during the First World War for publicly lecturing against the US entering the conflict, wrote the note to a critic called Godfrey Carter.

He wrote from his home in Petersfield, Hampshire: 'The general argument for pacifism is that more harm is done by fighting than by submitting to injustice.

'I do not like this as an absolute principle, for example the amount of force required by the police in dealing with a burglar is not great enough to destroy civilised society.

'But an unjustified attack by one great power on another is a different matter.

'I will argue that if the Germans succeeded in sending an invading army to England we should do best to treat them as visitors, give them quarters, and invite the Commander in Chief to dine with the Prime Minister. Such behaviour would completely baffle them.

Bertrand Arthur William Russell was born at Trelleck on 18th May, 1872, but by the age of three he was orphaned.

His father had wished him to be brought up as an agnostic; but to avoid this he was made a ward of Court, and brought up by his grandmother.

In 1890 the social critic went into residence at Trinity College, Cambridge, and after achieving a First Class with distinction in philosophy degree he was elected a fellow of his college in 1895.

In 1920 Russell visited Russia to study the conditions of Bolshevism and in the autumn he lectured philosophy at the Peking university in China.

The philosopher is best known for his work in mathematical logic and analytic philosophy. But he is recognized as one of the main founders of modern analytic philosophy.

But he is also known for his staunch anti-nuclear protests and his campaign against western involvement in the Vietnam War.

He was awarded the Order of Merit in 1949 and the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950.

'If, on the other hand, we fight them, we may win, or we may lose. If we lose, obviously no good as been done.

'If we win, we shall inevitably, during struggle, acquire their bad qualities, and the world, at the end, will be no better off than if we had lost.'

In the event, he went on to change his view that war was the lesser of two evils if it meant stopping Hitler from taking over Europe and being a threat to democracy.

Chris Albury, of Dominic Winter Auctioneers, said: 'Bertrand Russell was the most famous British philosopher of the 20th century and he wrote a history of western philosophy.

'He was totally unafraid to express his opinions however cranky they might have been.

'He had some strange ideas about society and family life and the Nazis as well.

'It is very striking to read it now and to think that such an intelligent person had such strange views.

'I don't suppose there were many intelligent people who were expressing such an opinion as his at the time.

'There was an inkling of war all through the 1930s and people like Winston Churchill had very firm views about Germany's intentions.

'However, once the war started Russell was approving of it because he thought life would be worse if the had won.'

The letter is expected to make £300 when it sells at auction on January 29.
