The editor of the London Evening Standard issued a grovelling apology last night after the newspaper published details of the Budget before George Osborne stood up to deliver it.

Sarah Sands said she was ‘devastated’ by the error, which resulted in a photograph of the newspaper’s front page story on the Budget being published on Twitter while MPs were still waiting for the Chancellor to begin.

She said a ‘very young and inexperienced’ journalist had been suspended while the newspaper carried out a full investigation.

‘We have immediately reviewed our procedures,’ she said.

‘We are devastated that an embargo was breached and offer our heartfelt apologies.’ 

A Treasury source acknowledged the episode had led to the early release of ‘market sensitive’ information on growth and borrowing forecasts.

City traders and financial speculators could potentially have used the early sight of the figures to profit and any misuse would be difficult to prove.

Commons Speaker John Bercow told MPs today that he had accepted the apologies of the Evening Standard for breaking an embargo on the Budget but would be asking the Chancellor to investigate why the briefing happened.

Mr Bercow said he would take no further action against the newspaper after editor Sarah Sands and political editor Joe Murphy apologised after the London paper's front page, featuring details of the Budget, was tweeted before George Osborne stood up in the Commons yesterday.

But the Speaker said the bigger problem was the 'prior briefing' to the newspaper.

Making a brief statement in the Commons, Mr Bercow said: 'The Evening Standard yesterday published the main points of the Budget before the House was informed of them by the Chancellor.

'I have received formal apologies from the editor and from the political editor of the Evening Standard. They have also apologised separately to the Chairman of Ways and Means (Lindsay Hoyle).

'I shall place those communications in the library. Their error was extremely regrettable but I am minded not to take that matter further.

'However, the error would not have occurred had the newspaper not been in possession of prior detailed information about the Budget.

'This pre-briefing of Budget proposals is a matter of concern to me and, I judge, to the House as well.

'I am therefore writing to the Chancellor of the Exchequer to ask him to set out what happened on this occasion and whether this is a practice of the Treasury.

'I will revert to the House as necessary.'

It also led to embarrassment for Mr 
Osborne, as Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls taunted him in the chamber by 
waving a copy of the Standard’s front page – which revealed dire public 
borrowing and growth forecasts – while he delivered his speech.

Labour leader Ed Miliband demanded an 
investigation and said Mr Osborne ‘almost need not have bothered coming’
to the Commons ‘because the whole Budget, including the 
market-sensitive fiscal forecasts, were in the Standard’.

Major Budget leaks are treated as a very serious issue at Westminster. In 1947 Labour chancellor Hugh Dalton resigned after inadvertently leaking details of his own Budget to a newspaper.

In 1936, Cabinet minister Jimmy Thomas was forced to resign after an inquiry found he had leaked Budget details to a fellow MP and a business associate for personal gain.

The Evening Standard, along with the major broadcasters, traditionally receives a privileged early briefing on the Budget to allow it to prepare its first edition, which goes to press while the Chancellor is on his feet.

The details are released under a strict embargo which means they cannot be published before they are announced by the Chancellor.

Sources at the paper stressed the incident was not technically a ‘leak’ but the breach of an embargo.

The release of a picture of the Standard’s front page included the fact that this year’s growth target had been halved.

The newspaper’s political editor, Joe Murphy, also issued an apology during the Chancellor’s speech.

The Treasury is now likely to face questions from MPs over the level of detail pre-briefed to the media under embargo.

Gordon Brown’s former spin doctor Damian McBride last night said Treasury officials appeared to have given the Standard far too much information and were not ‘entirely innocent’.

He said normal procedure had been to tell the Standard only the broad themes of the Budget before the Chancellor stood up in the Commons.

Mr Osborne last night asked for a review of the practice of pre-briefing the media under embargo.
