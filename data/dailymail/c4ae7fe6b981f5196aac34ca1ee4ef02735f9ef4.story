Charged: Karen Worley Drake, 51, pictured, was arrested Sunday night after she failed sobriety exercises and refused to adhere to a breath test

A Florida woman has been charged with driving under the influence after police caught her half naked and stinking of booze inside her car with an empty box of booze and her dog.

Karen Worley Drake, 51, was arrested on Sunday night after she failed sobriety exercises and refused to adhere to a breath test.

Drake's car was parked halfway onto SW 129th Terrace Road in Dunnellon in Marion County just after 10 p.m.

A sheriff's deputy noticed Drake, of Lady Lake, and her dog inside the four-door vehicle and walked over.

He then asked her to open her car door.

'I could smell a very strong odor of an alcoholic beverage,' the deputy said in a police report.

The deputy then noticed Drake was completely naked from the waist down.

He instructed her to dress herself after spotting some pants in the vehicle.

When he told her that she was under arrest, the woman became aggressive, the deputy wrote.

'I advised the defendant that she was under arrest for DUI and she became uncooperative and briefly struggled with me,' he wrote in the report.

Booked: The Lady Lake woman remains in the Marion County Jail, pictured, with a $1,000 bond, while the dog was placed into the custody of Marion County Animal Services
