U.S. officials are investigating the possibility that Russian hackers were responsible for attacking unclassified White House computer systems this week, forcing tech teams to take several systems offline.

The Obama administration has described the impact as an 'inconvenience,' as staffers temporarily lost access to some digital resources. But the thought of a stealth cyberattack by Russian President Vladimir Putin – or by his industrialist cronies – is sending shock waves through Washington.

Putin is, by all accounts, furious at the United States for a regime of punishing economic sanctions designed to pressure him to disengage his military from armed conflict in Ukraine. 

The New York Times reports that FireEye, a Silicon Valley cybersecurity firm, found that Russian hackers were behind a series of cyberattacks striking governments in Georgia, Poland, Hungary, and Mexico, along with NATO and several Eastern European nations – and their militaries.

Hackers attacking the White House? It makes sense, experts say, given the havoc they could cause if they ever seized control of government computers

The Russians also allegedly targeted the computers of journalists whose reporting focuses on issues that the Putin government considers top-of-mind.

'This is no smash-and-grab, financially motivated Russian cybercriminal,' FireEye threat intelligence manager Laura Galante told the Times. 'This is Russia using their network operations to achieve their key political goals.'

White House officials have confirmed that the attack on their computer infrastructure didn't accomplish anything approaching digital vandalism. No data was destroyed and the intruders were more akin to peeping Toms than to arsonists.

'The activity of concern is not being used to enable a destructive attack,' National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan told the Times.

The administration won't directly address the possibility that Russians are to blame.

'It would be unwise, I think for rather obvious reasons, for me to discuss from here what we have learned so far,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Wednesday during a briefing. 

'So what I can tell you as a general matter, though, is something that will not be particularly surprising to you. There are many people around the world who would love to gain greater insight into the activities of the United States government by collecting information from the White House network.'

Earnest also said the computer network at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is 'subject to daily cyberattacks, or at least efforts to infiltrate it.'

'We take these kinds of activities very seriously,' he added. 

Equally serious is the fact that a country described as a 'friendly ally' alerted the White House that its computers may be under attack. Surveillance detection in the U.S. government's computer systems apparently failed.

It's not clear if the Obama administration's unwelcome computer guests took anything, or if the foreign-government tipster was alerted by the presence of American material suddenly appearance on computer servers that typically host illicit data.

Hacker-in-chief, maybe: Russian President Vladimir Putin's government is suspected of being behind repeated efforts to infiltrate the Obama administration's computers

Another possibility is that hackers – like burglars casing a building, looking for security cameras, and casually trying to open doorknobs and windows – were trying to assess the White House's capacity to protect its computer systems.

The intruders may haev been trying 'to test what the security culture is, or to get valuable information about the security posture at the White House,' said Armond Caglar, a cybersecurity expert at the TSC Advantage consultancy.

This week's revelations aren't the first episode of organized, stealthy hackers from Russia targeting American interests.

In 2014 U.S. cybersecurity firms spotted a digital espionage campaign that appeared to target more than 1,000 computers at oil and gas companies in the West.

In addition to industrial secrets, experts believe the criminals were searching for a way to control the computers – and the physical systems they control – from thousands of miles away.

They covered their tracks by encrypting their communication and disguising their location, but the Times reports that small bits of Russian-language code was found in streams of data they left behind, along with other telltale signs like timestamps that established when the attacks were launched – in this case, during regular working hours in Moscow.
