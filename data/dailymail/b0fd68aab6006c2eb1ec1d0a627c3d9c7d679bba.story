Men who appeared in a video purporting to show 'Egypt's first gay wedding' were arrested and 'tested' for homosexuality.

Officials subsequently said that they'd 'tested negative for homosexuality'.

Precisely what the test involved hasn't been revealed, but it's thought to be an intrusive anal examination.

Men who appeared in a video purporting to show 'Egypt's first gay wedding' were arrested and tested for homosexual tendencies

 

Forensic authority spokesperson Hisham Abdel-Hamid told Ahram Online: 'According to inspection, the seven suspects have never had sex with other men.'

The video shows one man being given a ring, followed by shouts of delight from those watching.

According to one report, the video's title was misleading, because what actually happened was that the man was given a silver ring as a birthday present.

However, at the end the camera does linger briefly on a cake decorated with two men standing side by side.

The men were not arrested on suspicion of homosexuality, because being gay is not illegal in Egypt. However, 'debauchery' is against the law, and it was for this that the men were detained on Saturday.

Prosecutor General Hisham Barakat said the video 'violates public decency', but Human Rights Watch called for them to be released and said that anal examinations 'violate international standards against torture'.

Earlier this year an Egyptian court convicted four men of committing 'homosexual acts' and sentenced them to up to eight years in prison.

Police arrested the men for holding parties they say involved homosexual acts and where they found women's clothes and makeup.

Three of the four received eight years while one received three years with hard labour.

In 2011, a high profile trial of 52 men accused of being gay caught international attention and drew criticism from rights groups.

Twenty-three of them were sentenced to up to five years in prison while the rest were acquitted.
