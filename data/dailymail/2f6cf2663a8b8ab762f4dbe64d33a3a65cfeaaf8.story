At the height of the war in Iraq, the US military required a prison camp to detain suspected jihadis not deemed dangerous enough to warrant being sent to Guantanamo Bay. 

The military wanted to contain the ongoing insurgency and decided to intern suspected opponents to the rebuilding of Iraq.   

Camp Bucca, in southern Iraq was home to more than 22,000 prisoners at its peak in 2007. It was where nine of the leading members of what would become ISIS would meet.

Between 2003 and 2009 more than 100,000 suspected jihadis passed through the internment camp

Between 2003 and 2009 it is estimated that more than 100,000 men passed through the camp, many of whom left highly radicalised.  

During these years, the camp provided the leaders of the embryonic ISIS, the chance to form alliances with members of Saddam Hussein's ousted regime.

The camp was divided along sectarian grounds and militants enforced their own sharia law, indoctrinating many of those who would later join ISIS. 

Among those held in Camp Bucca was Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the current leader of ISIS. He was held in the camp 'for several years' before his release in 2009. 

Now, the US Department of Justice has sanctioned a $10 million bounty for information leading to the successful capture of al-Baghdadi.

According to the Department of Justice: 'Abu Du’a, also known as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is the senior leader of the terrorist organisation, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). 

'Reflecting its greater regional ambitions, al-Qaida in Iraq changed its name in 2013 to ISIL and stepped up its attacks across Syria and Iraq. 

'ISIL attacks are calculated, coordinated, and part of a strategic campaign. Abu Du’a is in charge of overseeing all operations and is currently based in Syria.

'Abu Du’a has taken personal credit for a series of terrorist attacks in Iraq since 2011 and claimed credit for the June 2013 operations against the Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad, the March 2013 suicide bombing assault on the Ministry of Justice, among other attacks against Iraqi Security Forces and Iraqi citizens going about their daily lives.

'Abu Du’a is a Specially Designated Global Terrorist under Executive Order 13224. He is also listed at the United Nations Security Council 1267/1989 al-Qaida Sanctions Committee.'

In June, al-Baghdadi said he wanted to create a 'caliph for the Muslims everywhere,' essentially claiming the entire world for ISIS. 

Al-Baghdadi's deputy Abu Muslim al-Turkmani was also held in Camp Bucca along with Abu Qasim, who is responsible for the terror organisation's growing band of foreign fighters. 

The US military used the camp to detain suspected fighters but not worth sending to Guantanamo Bay

Terrorism researchers believe that ISIS leaders used their time inside to make contacts with fellow fighters  

Terrorism researchers the Soufan Group, estimates that nine of ISIS's top leaders all spent time interned at Camp Bucca, where they were able to establish contacts and organise the future insurgency. 

In an editorial in the New York Times last month, Andrew Thompson and Jeremi Suri claimed the US made significant mistakes in the way it used Camp Bucca. 

He said: 'Before their detention, al-Baghdadi and others were violent radicals, intent on attacking America. Their time in prison deepened their extremism and gave them opportunities to broaden their following. 

'At Camp Bucca, for example, the most radical figures were held alongside less threatening individuals, some of whom were not guilty of any violent crime. Coalition prisons became recruitment centres and training grounds for the terrorists the United States is now fighting.'

Thompson and Suri added: 'At Camp Bucca, the extremists forced moderate detainees to listen to clerics who advocated jihad. The majority of prisoners were illiterate, so they were particularly susceptible. Prisoners frequently refused medical attention and vocational training for fear of breaking religious rules. The prisons became virtual terrorist universities: The hardened radicals were the professors, the other detainees were the students, and the prison authorities played the role of absent custodian.' 

When Camp Bucca closed in December 2009, US officials were unaware of the danger posed by the likes of al-Baghdadi and his fellow ISIS leaders, leading to many of today's problems.  

Inside Camp Bucca, prisoners where allowed to hold discussions on Islam with each other, which have now been blamed on allowing illiterate detainees to be radicalised. 

After it was closed, the camp was used as a secure hotel for foreign businessmen looking to invest in Iraq, where they were charged $200-a-night.  

After its closure in 2010, Camp Bucca was turned into a hotel for foreign businessmen at a rate of $200 a night
