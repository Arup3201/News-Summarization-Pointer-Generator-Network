Perhaps the fish you are eating was related to those swimming above your head at Ithaa restaurant, Maldives.

And it's a good idea not to go over the top on the wine if you're at the The Grotto Palazzese restaurant restaurant-on-the-rocks outside Bari, Italy.

This selection of eateries is a real collection of the weird and wonderful - yet each to itself has the undeniable wow factor.

Can I have a fishy, on a little dishy? Ithaa, which means mother-of-pearl in Dhivehi, is the very first undersea restaurant in the world

Floating oasis: The Rock, Zanzibar in Tanzania gives the look of the ideal postcard, and is certainly right out of the ordinary

Ithaa, which means 
mother-of-pearl in Dhivehi, the under-sea restaurant off the Maldives is arguably the most impressive - as swarms of fish skim the roof over your head, concentration on what delicacy to select may well wander.

The world's first undersea restaurant is five metres below sea level at the Conrad Maldives 
Rangali Island in Alif Dhaal Atoll in the Maldives.

The 
acrylic structure has a capacity of 14 people and a transparent roof 
with a 270° panoramic underwater view so you can stare at marine life 
all you want.

Italy's Grotto Palazzese, located on a promontory 24 metres above sea level, offers diners the chance to hear the waves crashing against the rock that actually houses the restaurant.

And the grand waterfall adjacent to the appropriately-named Labassin Waterfalls Restaurant in San Pablo City, the Philippines can help soothe the diner into a warm experience.

These restaurants will offer fine food, as well as an atmosphere and memories you will never forget - just don't forget your camera.

Impressive: The Sirocco, Bangkok will offer unrivalled views of the city

Cave culture: The Grotto Palazzese restaurant is embedded into the cliffs of Polignano, 30 kilometres from Bari in Italy

Misty in roots: Bali's central highlands are blessed with long-reaching views of paddies, trees and valleys, and La View in Ubud offers a split level dining experience with the majestic sights of the surrounding countryside

High dining: Stylish decor and city views combine with the Asiate in New York, the showpiece restaurant of the Mandarin Oriental, New York, a hotel thirty-five stories up in the Time Warner Centre. A window seat is obviously best, but diners report that on a sunny day, when the dining room is saturated with light, any table is a joy

That falling feeling: At the Labassin Waterfalls Restaurant in San Pablo City, the Philippines, lunch is served inches from the cascading water of an impressive set of falls

Eating barefoot: The Grotto restaurant, in Hotel Rayavadee in Krabi, Thailand, inside an ancient limestone cliff on the edge of Phranang Beach. The cave, with a floor of fine-powdered sand, opens on the beach. Shoes are optional, presumably

Underground haven: Ali Barbour's Cave, converted 30 years ago, is 30km south of Mombasa in Kenya, and compromises a series of interlinking chambers at depths of up to 10m below ground level. The natural holes in the roof crust are open to the sky, and candles complete the romantic vibe of this rather magical grotto

Seaside supper: A simple wooden deck looks out onto one of the most stunning ocean views in South Africa. The Two Oceans Restaurant occupies an enviable position above False Bay at the southwestern tip of Africa

Snow pretty: A beautiful mountain chalet in Chamonix, France, Le Panoramic has to be one of the best places to bask in the view of Mont-Blanc. Situated on the summit of Brévent and easily accessible even for pedestrians using a gondola and cable car, the restaurant is taking advance bookings right around now

Vertigo nights: In Hubei Province, 12 km north of the city of Yichang, China, you can experience fine-dining on the side of a cliff... which is fine if you're not afraid of heights. If you are, the 30-metre-long narrow concrete bridge hanging on the side of a vertical cliff overlooking the Yangtze River might just be your worse nightmare. Luckily, there's a metal railing you can grab on to while you crawl your way to the restaurant carved into the cliff-side

Red red skies: The Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is located in Tanzania on the edge of the world famous World Heritage Site of the Ngorongoro Crater. Surrounding the lodge, the Conservation Area stretches from the Rift Valley to the Serengeti

Inside out: Soho House in Hollywood will give you a very 'al fresco' feeling

Panoramic views: The Kuklos-Leipzig restaurant in Switzerland, completes one turn every hour and a half; so guests can admire both the Eiger north face and Mont Blanc from their seat
