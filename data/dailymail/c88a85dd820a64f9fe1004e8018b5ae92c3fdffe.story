Gregory Zavala, 23, of Tuttle, Oklahoma, is accused of raping and assaulting three teenage girls while holding them captive at his remote home for months at a time over a two year period 

Two of his victims were 16 and 17 at the time they were reportedly kidnapped. The third victim's age hasn't been disclosed, but officials say she was a minor at the time.

Court documents detail how Zavala allegedly enticed the three women at different times between 2011 and 2013 to the remote home that he shares with his parents.

The 16-year-old victim told police she was locked in his bedroom and held against her will between March 2011 and May 2011, reports NewsOK.com.

She told police she was allegedly forced to have sexual relations with Zavala 'on an almost daily basis.' 

Scared for her life and feeling isolated, she described his home as 'in the middle of nowhere,' according to an affidavit. 

She became pregnant and then was somehow able to escape. 

Another woman was 17 when she was held captive from January to August 2012.

During that time, she was punched, strangled, hit with a metal bar and cut with a box knife. 

She, too, was sexually assaulted and became pregnant as a result, but was eventually able to escape.

The third teenage victim began dating Zavala in October 2012. She was homeless at the time and had no family support, and he offered her a place to live. 

But shortly after she moved in, Zavala had her car towed, leaving her with no transportation.

In one particularly violent assault, Zavala allegedly bashed the woman in the head with a hammer multiple times in December 2012, causing a permanent skull deformity. 

When she tried to run from him, he struck her again in the head with the hammer and in the abdomen with a metal bar.

'Zavala told (her) no one would miss her when she was dead, because no one was looking for her,' the affidavit states.

The woman told investigators Zavala raped her nearly every day, court records show. 

Zavala allegedly used a belt on occasion to strangle her during the attacks, causing her to lose consciousness.

All three victims alleged that Zavala threatened to kill them and their families if they ever left his house. 

Zavala has a preliminary hearing date set for June 9 and his parents are also under investigation. 

He is being held in the Grady County jail on a $2 million bail. A judge has ordered that if he were to post bail he is not have contact with anyone under the age of 18.
