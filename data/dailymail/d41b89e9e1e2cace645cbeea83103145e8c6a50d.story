Exposed: Some doctors have been encouraged to refer most of their patients to private firms for treatments and scans

Hospital consultants and GPs are being bribed by private healthcare firms to send patients for expensive treatment, according to a report.

Doctors have been offered bonuses of up to £50,000 if they promise to refer most of their patients for scans and treatment at private clinics.

Officials have also uncovered evidence that doctors are encouraging patients to pay for procedures they do not need to pocket the cash.

Firms are also offering doctors 
incentives including free receptionists and consulting rooms – saving 
them thousands of pounds – in return for referring patients to their 
hospital.

A report by the 
Competition Commission watchdog has called for such schemes to be 
banned, warning that they are leading to patients paying millions in 
excess charges.

It says patients routinely pay twice as much as they 
should for private scans and tests because the industry is monopolised 
by a handful of firms that set prices too high.

These
include BMI, which has 65 private hospitals in the UK; Spire, which has
38; and HCA, which has six hospitals and four medical centres.

The report points out that this in turn raises patients’ premiums for private health insurance.

Good service: Doctors have been offered up to £50,000 bonuses and incentives such as free receptionists to encourage them to refer their patients to private clinics

Health insurers have no choice but to pay the high costs for private scans, operations and consultants for their customers and as a result raise their premiums.

The watchdog calculates patients have collectively been paying out up to £193million over the odds every year in health insurance premiums and direct payments for treatment.

Its chairman, Roger Witcomb, said: ‘The lack of competition in the healthcare market at a local level means that most private patients are paying more than they should either for private medical insurance or for self-funded treatment.

‘We’ve also seen the existence of a range of incentives which encourage medical professionals to choose facilities on grounds other than price and quality. We struggle to believe these can be in the interests of patients.’

Private: Spire, which runs 38 hospitals including this one in Bristol, is one of the firms reported to have been offering the incentives

While the watchdog opposes such incentives, they are not illegal. It did not state how many consultants were involved in such schemes nor how much they had been paid.

But the Mail is aware of one orthopaedic consultant who was offered £50,000 by BMI in exchange for referring three quarters of his patients for treatment at their private Bath Clinic hospital, which he refused.

The watchdog also uncovered a scheme in which GPs were being paid an unknown amount by BMI to refer patients to its Bath Clinic.

Previous reports suggest that 15 per cent of the 40,000 consultants in England have been offered incentives by private firms. Many consultants work both for the NHS and privately.

Stephen Collier, chief executive of BMI Healthcare, said he ‘rejected absolutely’ that the firm made profits at the expense of patients and insisted all money made was ploughed back into better care.

Rob Roger, chief executive of Spire Healthcare, said he ‘strongly disagreed’ with the report, adding: ‘We believe these findings are based on an unrealistic assessment of the markets in which we operate and the level of investment necessary to operate a high-quality hospital.’

HCA said it ‘welcomed transparency’ in consultant incentives but added that it was disappointed that the report had ignored the benefits of the firm’s healthcare.
