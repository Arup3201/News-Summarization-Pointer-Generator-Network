There's a commonly-held belief that old and new money don’t mix.

So when property developer Simon Gallop built a £2.5million mock-Georgian mansion next to aristocrat Paul Willan’s Victorian pile, the risk of things going awry were always high.

The pair clashed almost instantly over boundaries and then over a tree. But things reached a head when lawyer Mr Willan, the descendant of a 16th century Italian count, was caught on CCTV smashing his neighbour’s ornamental lights.

High-flier... and not  bad climber: Paul Willan, left, clambered over his neighbour Simon Gallop's garden wall and smashed five Georgian lamps with a scaffolding pole

Mr Gallop, 37, said he was stunned when he spotted five lamps, costing £2,000 each, had been vandalised.

As his house is covered by CCTV 
cameras he reviewed the film and was shocked to discover footage of Mr 
Willan peering over the wall ‘like a meerkat’.

Video showed Mr Willan, dressed in a pinstripe suit, clambering over the adjoining wall clutching a long scaffolding pole.

The senior law partner, who was 
awarded an Italian knighthood and has a family seat in Turin, then 
smashed the five Georgian lamps adorning Mr Gallop’s courtyard and 
driveway.

A furious Mr Gallop called police and Mr Willian, 56, a father-of-three, was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage.

After being questioned he admitted the offence, expressed regret, and was issued with a caution.

The incident was the culmination of a two-year feud between the pair who live in a leafy millionaire’s row in Bowdon, Cheshire.

They had earlier become locked in a 
bitter boundary dispute which escalated after Mr Gallop chopped back the
branches of a sycamore which he said were overhanging his new property.

Mr Gallop, the managing director of 
Belmont Homes, said he was worried branches could snap during the winter
and damage his roof and also feared that falling leaves could block his
drains.

But Mr Willan, a senior partner at 
Linder Myers solicitors in Manchester, complained the tree surgeon had 
trespassed on to his property to chop back some branches.

Police were called in over the lights row last month.

In a statement Mr Gallop said: ‘I 
checked the CCTV and could not believe it. Mr Willan popped up like a 
meerkat peering over the wall. Then fully-suited he dropped into my 
courtyard and started smashing up the lights.

'My first instinct was to go round and confront him, but I thought the best thing to do was call the police.’

Yesterday Mr Willan, who is the 
official solicitor to the Italian Consulate in Manchester, said the 
incident was part of an on-going row.

The pair are locked in a civil battle with both claiming compensation for damage caused to their properties.

Neighbours say Mr Willan, who lists 
his interests as shooting, real tennis and 20th century Japanese art, 
has been left so distressed by the dispute he has put his £2million 
house up for sale.

The lawyer, whose mother was Italian,
is a descendant of an Italian count, ennobled for heroics on the 
battlefield during the 16th century.

The family seat is near Turin but, because the country is a republic, the title has little modern significance.

A statement from his law firm said: 
‘Mr Willan has claims against Mr Gallop for trespass and criminal damage
on two separate occasions, the latter [being] the damage to certain 
trees which caused the present incident. Mr Willan regrets and 
apologises for the current incident and acknowledges responsibility.’

Linda Roberts of Heatons Solicitors, 
representing Mr Gallop, said: ‘We are awaiting quotes for the damage Mr 
Willan caused to my client’s property and will be seeking damages 
accordingly.’
