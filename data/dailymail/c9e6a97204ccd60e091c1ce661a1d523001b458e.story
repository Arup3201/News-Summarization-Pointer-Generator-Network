It is one of the most anticipated next-generation titles, and now Ubisoft want Watch Dogs to compete with the likes of the Grand Theft Auto series.

Speaking to Edge last week, the publisher's executive director for EMEA territories, Alain Coore, says they intend to bring something new to the open-world genre.

Stunning: Ubisoft have released these new screens on their Watch Dogs Facebook page. The game will be appearing on current and next-gen consoles although it will likely look its best on PC and PS4

'Yes, Grand Theft Auto is one of the biggest brands in the 
industry and everybody respects the brand and we'll have fun playing the
 next one too,' he said.

'But I think Watch Dogs' positioning is also on next-gen, bringing a lot of features - connectivity, interactivity, companion gaming and so on which is bringing some freshness to the genre.'

He added: 'The spirit will be that this kind of game is great fun and I think Watch Dogs can also bring a lot of the same fans.'

The game sees you play as Aiden Pearce who can hack into electronic devices tied to the city's central operating system. As witnessed in the E3 gameplay demo last year, this opens up numerous ways to complete objectives.

According to a report on DSOgaming, Watch Dogs is powered by a brand new engine called Disrupt, capable of running across current and next-gen platforms. It is the second engine Ubisoft have revealed of late, following the use of AnvilNext in Assassin's Creed 3.

Brutal: Watch Dogs is set for a Holiday 2013 release and has been confirmed as a PS4 launch title

Watch Dogs was last week confirmed as a launch title for Sony's PS4 during the 2013 holiday period. Other titles penned for launch release include Killzone: Shadow Fall and Drive Club.

Ubisoft CEO, Yves Guillemot, recently revealed that the team are focusing on the next-generation versions of the title, and are backwards adapting it for PS3 and Xbox 360.

'While the next-gen is further advanced, we will also optimise all that we have and feed that into the current-gen consoles,' Corre added.

'Our engineers say that it will be possible to have a great experience on both next-gen and current-gen. We are going to try and optimise as much as we can and try to respect the abilities of the current-gen so that the experience that players have on current-gen is great – that’s really important for us.

Built from scratch: The game, which focuses around hacking, is reportedly built on a custom engine aptly called Disrupt

'Watch Dogs is super-important on next-gen, of course, but it is also on current-gen because it will take a while before every gamer we have will play on next-gen. We must respect our current situation.'

There is still no news on a Wii U version, although this is expected to be announced later in the year.
