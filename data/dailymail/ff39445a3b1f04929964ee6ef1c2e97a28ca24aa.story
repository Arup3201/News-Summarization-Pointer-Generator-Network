A T-shirt company promoting race equality released a video on Tuesday with children from Ferguson, Missouri aimed at calling attention to the racism that still exists in America today.

FCKH8.com is a 'for-profit T-shirt company with an activist heart' that donates $5 out of every $13 dollars spent on T-shirts to charities working to fight racism.

The Blaze reports that the T-shirt company recruited six children from Ferguson, Missouri who lived on the same block where teenager Michael Brown, 18, was shot in the face by police officers.

Joining together: A T-shirt company recruited kids from Ferguson who lived on the same block as Mike Brown to join together to fight racism

Misconceptions: The video pointed out the misconceptions white people have today about the existence of racism

Things white people say: This girl mockingly pretends to be a white person who doesn't have to deal with racism

The video begins by saying that Ferguson is the place, 'where white police shot an unarmed black teen in the face.'

The shooting spawned a nationwide discussion about the prevalence of racism in the modern day despite having a black president in office and supposedly living in more accepting times.

In the background a kid can be heard yelling that the incident is, 'a national disgrace.'

The video goes on to point out things that white people allegedly say about racism and their belief that it  no longer exists.

'But is racism still a thing?,' a a kid asks pretending as though they were ignorant.

'All this focus on race makes me uncomfortable.'

'Try being black,' pipes an adorable little boy.

'It’s you people who are making this about race,' say one kid,

'I don’t see color,' mocked another.

'You people are just playing the race card,' said a kid pretending to be a jaded white person.

'Some of my best friends are black.'

Later in the video a white man appears in the video and talks about how fighting racism is about joining together.

'Racism is not over but I’m over racism,' says the T-shirt and the message the the children are trying to send to racist America.

Puts them in their place: 'Try being black' says a little boy in response to white people saying that talking about race makes them uncomfortable

'You people': The kids point out how white people deflect the race issue by saying only black people are bringing it up

Excuses, excuses: White people sometimes say they aren't racist because they 'don't see color'

Join forces: A white guy appears in the end of the video to express the need for white people to stand up and start fighting racism against blacks

No games: These kids aren't sidestepping the issue about what types of excuses white people make for racist behavior
