Ambulance chiefs in Wales are today coming under intense pressure to improve after recording the worst set of emergency response figures in history.

Just 42.6 per cent of the most serious emergency ambulance calls reached their casualty within the stipulated eight minutes in December.

That figure is down almost 10 per cent from November's figure of 51 per cent.

Performance figures on those Category A calls, which are deemed immediately life threatening, ranged from barely a quarter (28.3 per cent) in Torfaen to 61.5 per cent in Conwy.

Ambulance response times have fallen to their worst levels on record, with just 42.6 per cent of responses to the most serious emergency calls (category A calls) reached their casualty within the stipulated eight minutes - short of the 65 per cent target set by the Welsh Government

Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have blamed the ‘truly appalling’ performance on cuts to the health service budget by the Labour-led administration in Cardiff.

The Welsh Government dictates that 65 per cent of all emergency calls should be reached within eight minutes. 

Tracy Myhill, interim chief executive at the Welsh Ambulance Service, said: 'We completely appreciate that this presents an unacceptable level of service delivery across the whole health and social care system.

'An ageing population and more people with long-term illnesses means that more people than ever before are relying on our ambulance service.

'That's why we're rolling out a host of innovative new projects to help ease the pressure.' 

Ambulance crews in Wales were called to a total of 40,147 emergency calls in December - an increase of 11.2 per cent on November and 7.6 per cent up from December 2013.

Of these, 16,078 were triaged as Category A calls, meaning the patient was thought to be in a life-threatening condition.

That figure is a rise of 14.3 per cent of Category A calls in November, and 9.3 per cent rise on the same period in 2013.

One in 10 ambulances took 30 minutes or more to arrive in December, and one in five emergency ambulance responses took longer than 20 minutes to arrive.

Meanwhile figures from BBC Wales this morning showed police forces in Wales had to take patients to A&Es on 115 occasions in December.

The interim chief executive of the Welsh Ambulance Service, Tracy Myhill, said: 'We completely appreciate that this presents an unacceptable level of service delivery across the whole health and social care system'

If all of these cases should have been covered by ambulances as Category A calls, it would suggest that police are covering around 0.7 per cent of emergency medical cases. 

Ms Myhill said among the measures introduced to help the service cope is inviting A&E consulatants to join paramedics in rapid response cars to help assess patients and decide whether to take them to A&E.

And clinicans have been invited into ambulance control rooms, to ensure call handlers are sending the most appropriate resources to patients.

In addition the Welsh Government has set aside an additional £11 million funding to help the ambulance service cope with such high demand.

A Welsh Government spokesperson said: 'These figures demonstrate the immense pressure the Welsh ambulance service was under throughout December.

'The demand on the service was unprecedented. 

'They are nevertheless disappointing and there is no complacency about the need to improve performance.

'The ambulance service's own figures show it received a record high demand for an emergency response to patients in imminent danger of death - 10.8 per cent higher than the second highest number of Red 1 calls reported in December 2012.'

Leader of the Welsh Conservatives Andrew Davies, said: 'These figures are truly appalling and indicate the mess in which the health minister now finds himself.

'Clearly urgent action must now be taken to address the alarming decline in ambulance response times.

'These are the worst response times on record and it is vital that the health minister works with all interested parties to address the very serious issues facing the ambulance service in Wales.

'Despite the best efforts of dedicated Welsh NHS staff, ambulance response targets have not been met in Wales for several years but we appear to have reached a new low and Mr Drakeford faces serious questions.'

Ed Miliband was accused of trying to ‘airbrush out’ his party’s shameful record on the NHS in Wales after it removed all references to the health service in leaflets sent out there.

A Labour leaflet currently being sent to constituencies across England boasts about the party’s ‘plan for the NHS’ and includes several images of nurses, doctors and hospitals.

But the version being delivered to Welsh homes makes no mention of the health service or Labour’s record there.
