The Queen is now the oldest monarch in the world after the death of  King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia at the age of 90.

Her Majesty, who is 88, was born on April 21, 1926 and has reigned through more than five decades, celebrating her Diamond Jubilee in 2012. She took the throne at the age of 25.

But despite being the oldest monarch in the world - she is only the second longest-reigning.

King Rama IX of Thailand has served for 68 years whereas the Queen's reign is just under 63 years.

King Abdullah died in hospital last night aged 90 and was immediately replaced by his brother Prince Salman, 79.

His death will be upsetting for Her Majesty and her family, having built a close relationship with him.

Death: Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz died following a battle with pneumonia

He was taken to hospital on New Year’s Eve with suspected pneumonia, is believed to have left four wives and 22 children after nearly ten years on the throne of one of the world’s richest countries.

It is likely that Prince Charles – a personal friend of King Abdullah – will attend his funeral today.

Either the Queen will make the Royal Flight available to Charles or a private jet will be chartered.

King Abdullah was one of the 37 sons of King Abdul Aziz Al-Saud, who created the modern state of Saudi Arabia in 1932.

His brother Prince Salman, 79, is already king but there were concerns last night that, despite the swift succession, the news would send shockwaves across the Middle East.

Saudi Arabia is already facing uncertainty over the recent dip in global oil prices and the rise of terror group Islamic State in neighbouring Iraq.

The price of crude oil rose by two per cent on the world markets after the king’s death was announced.

The Prime Minister has paid tribute to his work for peace in the region.
