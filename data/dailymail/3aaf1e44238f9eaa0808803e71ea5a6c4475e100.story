Killed: Saad al-Hilli, a British-Iraqi engineer, was shot dead alongside his wife and mother-in-law in the French Alps

Two sisters orphaned during a gun attack in the Alps in which four died are to be taken out of foster care and returned to their family – under police protection.

Young Zainab and Zeena al-Hilli have spent the last 10 months under the protection of social services.

This was mainly because at least one adult member of their own family was under suspicion following the murder of their parents near Lake Annecy, in eastern France.

Saad al-Hilli, a 50-year-old satellite engineer from Surrey and his wife Ikbal, 47, died alongside the girls’ grandmother Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, as they sat in the family BMW estate car.

Sylvain Mollier, a 45-year-old French cyclist, was also shot dead in the attack on September 5 last year. 

The authorities on both sides of the Channel still fear that the girls are in danger because Zainab is thought to have seen the killer or killers carrying out the attack. 

A High Court ruling handed down last week now clears the way for the girls to live with their maternal aunt, uncle and cousin, who cannot be named for legal reasons. 

Mr Justice Baker ruled that the family had been assessed by social services and ‘have the capacity to care for the girls in these very difficult circumstances which will include a level of police protection’.

The judge added: 'It is plainly in their interests to be brought up 
within their natural family. Such a placement will sustain links with 
their family background and may help them over time to come to terms 
with their tragic loss.'

The ruling says: ‘Zainab and Zeena have made it clear that they want to live with their aunt and uncle and cousin with whom they have a warm and close relationship.’

It continues: ‘The police do not say that the level of risk is such that they should not be placed with the aunt and uncle’, although the ruling insists on the continuation of police protection. 

Zaid al-Hilli, the children’s 54-year-old paternal uncle, was arrested last month at his home in Surrey on suspicion of being involved in the murders.

He is on bail awaiting further enquiries into an alleged dispute with his brother Saad over their father’s will. Zaid denies any involvement in the crimes.

The French authorities have privately 
criticised social services in the UK for preventing the girls from being
interviewed adequately about the attack, in which Zainab was pistol 
whipped and was hit by a bullet in her shoulder.

Eric Maillaud, the Annecy prosecutor, is among those who think that a thorough interview could provide vital clues.

Last October, Mr Maillaud said Zainab and her father got out of the car after parking in an isolated layby, but Mr al-Hilli then quickly returned to the vehicle.

‘She talked of hearing screams, of seeing violent acts and of her fear,’ said Mr Maillaud.

The Annecy murders have baffled detectives, with Zaid al-Hilli being the only arrest in connection with the case.

Mr Maillaud believes an international contract killing may have taken place, with a police source saying: ‘This was the work of somebody who knew exactly what he was doing. Whoever carried out this crime had no qualms. This was not the work of an amateur.’

A total of 21 bullets were fired at the scene and each hit its intended target. The bodywork of the BMW was unmarked.

Surrey police wanted to keep the High Court ruling a secret but, in a victory for open justice, Sunday Times writer David James Smith challenged an order to exclude him from court.

Lawyers for the newspaper successfully argued that ‘the right to attend is an important aspect of the media’s watchdog role’.
