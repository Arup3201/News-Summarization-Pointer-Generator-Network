Eden Hazard has light-heartedly questioned Chelsea team-mate Diego Costa's age.

The Blues forward joined in July for £32million from Spanish champions Atletico Madrid, but Hazard has jokingly suggested that the 25-year-old is older than he looks.

Speaking to Sky Sports show Soccer AM, the Belgian international commented about Costa: He looks old, I think he’s old. He is 25 but I don’t know if it is true.'

Despite questioning his date of birth, the Spain international has already impressed Hazard during their short time together at the Blues so far.

Dream start: Costa scored on his Premier League debut at Burnley on Monday night

The forward started Chelsea's comeback at Burnley on Monday, scoring the equaliser in their 3-1 opening day Premier League win at Turf Moor.

Making his Chelsea debut alongside Costa was Cesc Fabregas - with the former Arsenal and Barcelona star excelling in midfield.

Fabregas laid on two assists for Jose Mourinho's side at Burnley and he and Costa have added quality to a talented squad, believes Hazard.

'They are very good I think Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas play very well and they are now in the team,' he added.

As well as the additions of the duo alongside Filipe Luis, Didier Drogba and the return of Thibaut Courtois; the 23-year-old was full of praise for Stamford Bridge boss Mourinho - citing his hunger to succeed as an admirable quality.

'He is a very good man. He has won everything in his life and he wants to win again it’s a pleasure that he is my manager,' Hazard added.

'He is funny, he’s funny. On the camera he is sometimes serious but on the pitch and in training he can make jokes and he is a good guy.'

When asked what's the best thing about his homeland, Hazard who was Belgium's talisman as they reached the quarter-finals, cheekily replied: 'French fries and beer, chocolate and me of course.'
