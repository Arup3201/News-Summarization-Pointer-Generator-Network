Buying a sports car, fretting over thinning hair and flirting embarrassingly with people 20 years your junior are usually dismissed as classic signs of a midlife crisis.

But it seems that this catch-all term will no longer work as an excuse for bad behaviour, as new research reveals the idea of suffering angst in your forties in a myth.

A growing number of studies suggest emotional turmoil is just as likely to happen when a person is in their twenties or sixties. 

Research by the University of Massachusetts Amherst suggests the idea of a midlife crisis is a  myth, despite being portrayed in films  like American Beauty by the main character, Lester Burnham, played by Kevin Spacey

Research by the University of Massachusetts Amherst, which looked at hundreds of people who graduated from college between 1965 and 2006, concluded that hitting 40 does not increase the chance of a life crisis.

Psychology professor Susan Krauss Whitbourne, who led the research, said: 'Given the ubiquitous nature of the midlife crisis notion, it might surprise you to learn that, as far as psychology is concerned, it's a myth.

'Scientific research shows that most of us go through our middle years without so much as a blip on our psychological radar screens.

'Even those in their forties, considered the prime age for the midlife crisis, showed no signs of suffering from the kind of existential angst we associate with this period of life.'

Bill Murray portrays ageing actor Bob Harris in the film, Lost in Translation, and gets involved with a much younger woman, which is a classic sign of a midlife crisis

The term mid-life crisis was first coined in 1965 where early analysis suggested that it could happen anywhere between the ages of 40 and 60

She interviewed 200 adults who graduated from college in the late 1950s, but found only one particular subgroup seemed to experience upheaval at that age.

These were the people she considered to be on the 'downward slope' route of development, who had made a series of poor decisions throughout their adult lives.

She said: 'Even these unhappy 50-somethings wouldn't have been considered candidates for the midlife crisis. Their unhappiness characterised them throughout their adult lives, not just in the decade of their forties.'

Other research conducted in Britain has identified the twenties as a troubled decade where many go through a 'quarter-life crisis'.

A study by the University of Essex last year found 86 per cent of people in their twenties felt anxious that they were not doing enough.

Damian Barr, author of the book Get it Together: A Guide to Surviving Your Quarterlife Crisis, said a growing number of 25-year-olds are experiencing pressures and demands previously felt by those in their forties.

He said: 'Being twentysomething now is scary – fighting millions of other graduates for your first job, struggling to raise a mortgage deposit and finding time to juggle all your relationships.

'We have the misfortune to be catapulted into a perilous property market. We're earning more and spending more than ever. We're getting into debt to finance our degrees, careers and accommodation.'

One in six people are also believed to suffer some sort of crisis in their sixties, according to research by the University of Greenwich.

Dr Oliver Robinson, who led the study, said: 'It is not a delayed midlife crisis. Nor is it just about retirement and people freaking out because their work routine has gone. 

'The research shows it is linked to loss.' 

The term mid-life crisis was first coined in 1965 where early analysis suggested that it could happen anywhere between the ages of 40 and 60,

But Professor Whitbourne believes the phrase should now be removed from our vocabularies.

She said: 'Nearly 40 years later, the midlife crisis is ready for its own midlife crisis. In fact, it's about time for it to bite the dust.

'To do that, we need simply to expunge the word from all of our vocabularies. The problem is that people like it too much.

'You can sweep a lot of bad behaviour under the midlife crisis carpet and never get blamed for any of it.

'Like Lester Burnham, the main character in American Beauty, played by Kevin Spacey, you can fall in love with the cheerleader next door, sell your beige minivan for a red (what else) sports car and in general act like a 16- (or maybe 12-) year-old boy.'
