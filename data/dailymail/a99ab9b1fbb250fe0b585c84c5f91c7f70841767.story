A driver has clocked up more than half a million miles in his second-hand Volvo - and it has never broken down.

Simon Marshall, 49, has driven the distance it would take to get to the Moon and back in his silver V70 D5 SE, which he bought six years ago.

But despite inheriting 170,000 miles - and clocking up a further 415,000 since - he has never had to call any breakdown services.

Astonishing: Simon Marshall, 49, has driven the same distance it would take to get to the Moon and back in his Volvo V70 D5 SE, which he bought for £5,000 in 2008 and has still never once broken down

Mr Marshall, from Sandhurst, Berkshire, said: 'I took a chance on the car, because it was a bargain and I never imagined I would get this many miles out of it.

'I have become very fond of it, and friends refer to it as my Viking Long Boat.'

'It has never left me stranded on the side of the motorway and I have every faith in it getting me from A to B safely.'

Mr Marshall racks up around 100,000 miles per year - more than 10 times that of the average motorist.

He bought the second hand car for £5,500 and has only spent £3,000 on minor repairs, servicing and tyres.

Beaten the odds: Mr Marshall, a driver by trade, scales 100,000 miles a year - 10 times the average motorist. Here, the meter shows he has driven 575,574 miles, and he plans to scale the same again in this car

Pride: The car has the same parts it came with six years ago aside from the gearbox, which is also second-hand

Astonishingly, the 10-year-old Volvo has 
most of its original parts including the engine, exhaust, turbo, 
alternator and all four brake callipers.

The most expensive item he has had to buy for the car is an £800 second-hand gearbox - which has carried him across 400,000 more miles.

Mr Marshall uses his Volvo for both business and pleasure, with his job as a private hire driver - but also drives his family around Europe in the car on Summer holidays.

He has taken his wife Diane, 44 and his 
five teenage children on many holidays in the car to France and Spain 
and also up and down the UK.

He said: 'One of the things I enjoy is having a good quality car, without paying a fortune for it.

Not giving up: Mr Marshall plans to make it to a million miles in his trusty Volvo, which is still going strong

Strong: With just two services in its time, Mr Marshall encourages all drivers to buy a bargain motor

'I’m not in the business to be buying a Porsche but it doesn’t matter because this car has never let me down and I don’t want anything else.

'If someone wanted a lift to the South of France right now I would have no hesitation in going with this car. It is the most reliable vehicle I have ever known and I have put my complete faith in it.

'Most people have a mental block when they see a car with 100,000 miles on the clock. But I just see it as a way of getting a bargain.'

'I still plan to keep driving the Volvo around as long as I can - it would be such a shame to part with it now.'
