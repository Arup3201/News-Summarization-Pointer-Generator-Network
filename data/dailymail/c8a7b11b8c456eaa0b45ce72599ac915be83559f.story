A Delta flight went off the runway at LaGuardia Airport in New York City on Thursday morning, stopping just short of Flushing Bay.

FDNY rushed to the scene as Delta Flight 1086, an MD-88 arriving from Atlanta, skidded off runway 13, was leaking fuel and had a broken wing after striking a fence during blizzard conditions.

The airport initially reported that the plane had caught fire, though there were no visible signs from the scene.

The plane was immediately evacuated, and all 127 passengers and five crew members were safely removed within 30 minutes of the plane's landing, walking out on the broken wing and going down a slide.

LaGuardia was shut down soon after the incident as the plane was leaking 300 gallons of fuel at a rate of a gallon a minute, with all incoming flights being diverted and outgoing flights being grounded.

The fuel leak was quickly contained.

CNN reports that only minor injuries had been sustained, with the FDNY saying while numerous individuals were being treated only three were transported to a hospital.

It has been reported that 24 people were injured in total.

The transcript from the tower shows that the flight was given the all clear to land on the runway and told that the breaking action had been reported as 'good.'

Once the plane hit the runway it did not respond to the tower, and as soon as the air traffic controllers realized what happened they immediately announced the airport was closed. 

'Customers deplaned via aircraft slides and have moved to the terminal on buses,' Delta said in a statement. 

'Our priority is ensuring our customers and crew members are safe. Delta will work with all authorities and stakeholders to look into what happened in this incident.'

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey reported that two planes that landed just before the Delta flight reported good breaking on the runway, and that the plane skid roughly 5,000 feet down the runway. 

'I think the pilot did everything he could to slow the aircraft down,' said Port Authority head Patrick J. Foye during a news conference.

I'm not even sure what went through my mind because you're not even sure what's happening,' said passenger Mark Clafter.

'And then it wasn't until the plane came to a stop that all of the sudden you think, 'Holy cow! We just skidded off the runway."'

He added that through it all,, 'no one was screaming, no one was freaking out, and when we came to a dead stop people were actually really calm.'

He said that when they stopped all power went out and the pilot had no way of speaking to the passengers, but even then no one panicked.

One of the passengers, Jamie Primak, who stars on the Bravo reality show Jersey Belle, wrote; 'We just crash landed at LGA. I'm terrified. Please...' 

She later wrote; 'We have all been evacuated. Everyone is safe. Thank you for your prayers. God is good.' 

New York Giants tight end Larry Donnell was also on the plane and shared a photo and video on Instagram as he evacuated on the runway, joking; 'Look at this sh*t! Knew I shoulda stayed my ass at home.' 

He later released a statement saying; 'I feel fine physically and hopefully all the other passengers did not have any significant injuries We were all shocked and alarmed when the plane started to skid, but most importantly, as far as I know, all of the passengers and flight crew were able to exit the plane safely.'

A woman named Vanessa also shared a photo as she left the plane, writing; '#survive #crashlanding #noinjuries.' 

Now some are questioning whether the airport should have even been open during these snowy and icy conditions.

Though the runway had reportedly been plowed shortly before the landing, there were three inches of snow measured near the airport for the day.

Slid off runway: The plane was evacuated in under 30 minutes

One passenger named Steve  stressed just how scary it was inside the plane, writing; 'The pics are deceptive. That is side of runway. We were going in water until hit the hill and spun. #crashland.'

The plane's nose was on the rocks that surround the bay. 

'We came in for landing, the plane hit the ground. As it started to apply the brakes, it started skidding. It didn’t spin around or anything,' passenger Sam Stern told the New York Post.

'It ended up hitting the embankment. The wing broke off.' 

'2 seconds more we would have been in the water!' wrote Jared Faellaci, who posted a photo of the view from his window.

MSNBC thought they had managed to score an interview with Donnell shortly after the crash, but it turned out to be an impostor who said live on air 'F**k her right in the p***y.'

The FAA has announced the airport will open again at 2pm with limited service.
