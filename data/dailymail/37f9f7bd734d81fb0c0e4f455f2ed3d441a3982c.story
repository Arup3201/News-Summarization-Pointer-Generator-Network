Blackpool have sent Jacob Murphy back to Norwich after a picture circulated on social media this week showing the on-loan winger mocking the Seasiders' plight.

The teenager apologised on Monday for a leaked image of Murphy and fellow Blackpool loanee Donervon Daniels which was accompanied by the caption 'We are going to lose... Again'.

The photograph was believed to have been taken before the club's most recent defeat against Sheffield Wednesday on Boxing Day.

Blackpool boss Lee Clark said the matter would be investigated internally and the struggling Sky Bet Championship club have now elected to send Murphy, who was due to remain with them until February, back to Carrow Road.

'Jacob is a talented player with a bright future ahead of him and his recent actions should not detract from that,' Clark said on Blackpool's official website.

'However, he realises that he made an error of judgement and understands why we have come to this decision.

'The players and the team need to be fully focused on our fight to stay in the Championship.'

The Seasiders are rooted to the foot of the division having only won twice all season and they remain nine points adrift of safety heading into 2015.

In his apology on Monday, Murphy, 19, had stressed he was keen to make amends on the pitch in Blackpool colours.

'It was totally unprofessional of me and a foolish thing to do,' Murphy said in an statement on the club's website.

'I'd like to offer my sincerest apologies to the manager, my team-mates, the fans and everybody at Blackpool Football Club for the hurt and embarrassment that a recent photo message I sent has caused.

'I have loved my time at Blackpool so far, and I've been really grateful for the support I've received.

Blackpool boss Lee Clark condemned Murphy's action via the club's official website on Monday

'I know I have let the manager and fans down badly but I aim to repay them by working even harder and helping the team climb up the league table.

'I'd also like to make clear that Donervon Daniels had no part in this and I apologise for implicating him.'

Murphy became Clark's first signing at Bloomfield Road when he moved to the club in November.

He made nine appearances in total and scored on his debut in a 2-2 draw at Fulham while also finding the net in a draw with Bolton later that month.
