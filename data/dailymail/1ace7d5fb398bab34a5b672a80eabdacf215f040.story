Fierce fighting continues to rage in eastern Ukraine today as government forces claimed they killed 300 pro-Russian separatists.

Kiev's 'anti-terrorist operation' said the rebel fighters were killed and about 500 wounded in the past 24 hours in and around the city of Slaviansk, a strategically located separatist stronghold.

Government forces used aircraft, helicopters and artillery in a fierce attack to try to root out the separatists who have controlled Slaviansk and surrounding areas since early April.

Meanwhile, U.S. President Barack Obama issued a new warning to Russia saying the West will 'refuse to allow the dark tactics of the 20th century to define the 21st.'

The rebels however denied the government's casualty figures.

'Reports of 300 dead are not true. Losses to the Ukrainian side were more than ours,' Aleksander Boroday, 'prime minister' of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, was quoted as saying by Interfax news agency.

Describing the fighting as 'heavy', the government forces spokesman, Vladyslav Seleznyov, said two servicemen had been killed and 45 wounded.

Fighting was continuing in Slaviansk region and mopping-up operations were underway in the nearby town of Krasny Liman, which he said government forces had taken control of on Tuesday.

President-elect Petro Poroshenko ordered the resumption of operations by government forces to quell the rebellion by pro-Russian militia in the Russian-speaking east soon after scoring a resounding victory in an election on May 25.

The Kiev government says the fighting is being stirred up by Moscow, which opposes its pro-Western course.

Kiev also accuses Russia of letting volunteer fighters cross into Ukraine to fight alongside the rebels. Moscow denies this and is urging Ukraine to end military operations and open dialogue with the separatists.

Since government forces resumed their push against the rebels, there have been clashes in and around the main industrial hub of Donetsk and near the border town of Luhansk, with loss of life on both sides.

But it is not clear what real progress the Ukrainian military - whose initial efforts in April to root out the rebels flopped with defections and loss of military equipment - are making against the rebels who occupy strategic points in densely populated cities.

Russian president Vladimir Putin, who was not invited to today's G-7 meeting in Brussels, has been invited to France for the 70th anniversary of the D-Day invasion this Friday.

His expected to meet then with three G-7 leaders: French President Francois Hollande, British Prime Minister David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

British officials said Russia's actions since Ukraine's May 25 presidential elections - muted condemnation and a pullback of troops from Ukraine's border - are better than some had feared, and they hope Putin will use those meetings to demonstrate a more positive, engaged attitude.

In March, the U.S. and its most important allies retaliated for Putin's military occupation and subsequent annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula by suspending Russia's membership in what had been the G-8 club of rich countries.

They also nixed Putin's plan to hold the meeting in Sochi, the city Russia lavished billions on to host the 2014 Winter Olympics, and shifted the venue to a building in the Belgian capital instead.

Slaviansk, a town of about 130,000 
and located at the centre of the three main regions of eastern Ukraine, 
was quickly taken under the control of the rebels in early April and 
government forces have had little success in weakening their grip on the
 city.

The offensive in 
Slaviansk followed a daylong firefight on Monday in Luhansk, a town 
further to the east on the Russian border, after an attack by 
separatists on a border guard camp.

Government
 forces acknowledged on Wednesday that the border guard camp had been 
evacuated and personnel had left with their weapons, though the 
separatists described this as a surrender.

Zhanna,
 a resident of a nearby apartment block, said she saw guns and 
ammunition being removed from the base. 'The (separatist) militia has 
taken over the building and lowered the Ukrainian flag,' she said.

Meanwhile, President Barack Obama held up 25 years of Polish democracy as a beacon for neighboring Ukraine in a public celebration, warning Russia that the free world is united against its 'dark tactics' to violate Ukraine's sovereignty.

'We stand together because we believe that people and nations have the right to determine their own destiny - that includes the people of Ukraine,' Obama said before a crowd of more than 6,000 that spilled into the streets before Royal Castle, a symbol of Polish independence.

'Our free nations will stand united so that further Russian provocations will only mean more isolation and costs for Russia,' Obama said. 'Because after investing so much blood and treasure to bring Europe together, we refuse to allow the dark tactics of the 20th century to define the 21st.'

Obama spoke just after announcing new U.S. assistance for Ukraine's armed forces, including body armor and night vision goggles - the first such delivery of tools that would directly help Ukrainian troops in their battle against pro-Russian separatists.

Speaking from behind protective glass, Obama declared that 'the days of empires and spheres of influence are over.'

'Bigger nations must not be allowed to bully the small, or impose their will at the barrel of a gun or with masked men taking over buildings,' Obama said.

'And the stroke of a pen can never legitimize the theft of a neighbor's land. So we will never accept Russia's occupation of Crimea or its violations of Ukraine's sovereignty.'

He also assured east European NATO allies which were once part of the Soviet Union or its Warsaw Pact military bloc that the United States would defend their territorial integrity.

'Poland will never stand alone. Estonia will never stand alone. Latvia will never stand alone. Lithuania will never stand alone. Romania will never stand alone,' Obama declared
