The relatives of a 15-year-old boy, who collapsed and died following a personal training session, have been left in shock following his tragic death on Thursday.

Braidon Mcleod, from Bowen in Queensland, apparently got into difficulty during his exercise routine and stopped breathing.

It is understood that Braidon had recently started exercising in an attempt to lose weight and improve his fitness.

Queensland Police told Daily Mail Australia that his death was being treated as non-suspicious. 

Police were called to a Tracey St address in Bowen at 5:30pm yesterday. 

Braidon's mother Susan is an employee of Kidz at the Beach, an early childhood education centre based on Tracey St, Bowen. 

However, it has not been confirmed whether Braidon was exercising near his mother's workplace at the time of his death.

Braidon was taken to Bowen Hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Just last week his mother Susan posted a note of encouragement  to her son on her Facebook page.

The impression he's left on my life will fuel my passion to keep fighting this fight,' the post, which is attributed to Josh, said. 

Braidon's mother Susan frequently posted photos and posts to her Facebook account, praising her teenage son. 

On August 6th, Susan said she was thankful for her son and was proud of the life she had built for him.

'I am thankful I am able to provide for my son and give him the opportunities I can,' she said. 

In October 2013, Susan posted a heartfelt message to her son above a meme which stated: 'Have you ever looked at your kids and had your heart filled with so much love and pride that it brought tears to your eyes??? I have an it's amazing,' the picture said.

Susan posted the following response over the picture:  'Lucky enough to have this exact feeling last night, saying goodnight to my boy, and thinking my love for him is the purest most unconditional in the world, and how lucky am I to have that! Love you,' she said.
