Standing tall: Neil Fingleton, who is 7ft, 7in, towers over Emma Cannon who plays Maid Marion in the Robin Hood production.

A festive pantomime production of Robin Hood is expected to truly hit the heights this Christmas, after casting Britain's tallest man in one of the leading roles.

Actor Neil Fingleton, who stands at 7ft 5in, will play Little John at the Bradford Alhambra Theatre production over the festive period.

Britain's tallest man and the world's tallest actor, who wears size 15 shoes and has a 54-inch inside leg, has had his costumes specially-designed to fit his giant frame.

Mr Fingleton, 30, from Durham, went into acting after a back injury halted his basketball career, and he has recently completed filming of movie with Keanu Reeves.

Extreme height runs in his family - Mr Fingleton's brother is 6ft 10in, his sister is 6ft 3in and his great grandfather was 6ft 8in.

Mr Fingleton has been featured in documentaries about his height, has appeared in several advertising campaigns for international brands

Speaking about his acting career on the Guinness World Records website, he said: 'I have never been self conscious about my height.

'I am more conscious of going bald so that should tell you. I never let my height play a negative part in my life.

'I always do what I want, some tall people may be restricted as they are constantly stared at or people ask the same questions over and over.

'This is the only bad thing about being tall â€“ the stupid remarks and questions. Other than that, being tall is great.

'I have been doing acting work since my basketball career finished. I spent 8 years in the USA attending High School and College. I graduated from the College of the Holy Cross in 2004 with a degree in History. I have played professionally in Greece, Italy, Spain. Now I am concentrating on acting and trying to move to LA soon to jump in with both feet so to speak.'

The theatre are employing an array of special effects in the Robin Hood production featuring Britain's tallest man.

Effects will include an animatronic smoke-breathing dragon with a five-metre wing-span, which will fly over the audience, and an on-stage rainfall and enchanted waterfall which will answer questions by spelling out words.
