Unemployed young people need to learn lessons from the hard-working immigrants who have taken their jobs, Boris Johnson said last night.

The Mayor of London said that the younger generation are missing out on jobs because they do not have the same ‘energy to go out and get them’ as the foreigners being employed in this country.

Speaking a day after youth unemployment broke records, Mr Johnson said that there are vacancies, but British young people do not have the right work ethic.

'Get to work': Boris Johnson said that there are around 30,000 mid-market and lower-skilled vacancies in London alone

He pointed to successful sandwich chain Pret a Manger, noting native Londoners are rarely seen behind the till.

‘London is a fantastic creator of jobs – but many of these jobs are going to people who don’t originate in this country,’ he said.

‘They are hard-working, good people, and we need to learn from them and understand what it is that they have got that makes them able to get those jobs that young Londoners don’t have.’

Figures released earlier this week showed that more than one in five of those between the age of 16 and 24 are unemployed, hitting a total of 1.04million.

But Mr Johnson, who is hoping to beat Ken Livingstone in the mayoral race in May, said that there are around 30,000 mid-market and lower-skilled vacancies in London alone.

He said: ‘There are large numbers of job vacancies. Why are young people not taking up those jobs? How can we help them? That is the key problem for our economy.

‘In this city there are jobs going. It’s vital that Londoners have the skills and the aptitude but also the energy and appetite for work as well.’

He went on to suggest that British young people do not have the same determination as many of the foreign workers in hotels, coffee shops and shops in this country.

‘Let’s talk about work ethic,’ he said in the interview with The Sun. ‘I don’t want to stigmatise young people because many of them do have the aptitude. But we need to face up to these issues.

Unemployment figures this week showed that the overall jobless total has reached a 17-year-high of 2.69million

‘In some cases it can come down to the fact that the jobs are there and people need to have the energy to go out and get them.’

Unemployment figures this week showed that the overall jobless total has reached a 17-year-high of 2.69million.

Mr Johnson also criticised unemployed graduate Cait Reilly who claimed earlier this month that she is suing the Government for making her taken an unpaid work placement at Poundland in Birmingham.

He said she 'sneered' at hardworking Britons by saying the work was 'forced labour', telling newspaper: 'She should not turn down the opportunity to do work of a kind that many, many people do and value'.

He recalled his first job as a trainee reporter at The Times saying he could not believe how hard everyone worked when he first started and insisted Miss Reilly would learn from her work placement.
