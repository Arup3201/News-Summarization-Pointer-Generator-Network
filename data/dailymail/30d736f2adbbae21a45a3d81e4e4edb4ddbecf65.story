It should be a time of festive joy and cheer but for many people Christmas can be a pretty lonely time of year... especially if you've just been dumped. 

Because according to research the holiday season is one of the peak times that couples break up. Second only to spring and just pipping Valentine's day to the post.

Femail spoke to relationship expert and break up coach Laura Yates to find out not only why you might find yourself eating a Turkey dinner for one this Christmas, but how to get over it if you do. 

The holiday season is one of the peak times for break ups, second only to spring and just pipping Valentine's day to the post

New Year, New Them

Laura says: 'Christmas and the New Year always signifies a time of change and new goals. It's the most likely time of year that people want to think about self-improvement and life changes. 

This can also apply to relationships resulting in them ending with their partner.If you're the person left behind, you need to really think about whether you were having those same niggles too but perhaps brushing them to one side. 

Was the relationship in a rut, were you just going with the motions? And if not, if the two weren’t on the same page about where you want it to go, you're probably not the best fit for each other. Use the New Year as an opportunity for you to grow and make changes too.'

They don't want to meet your family...

'Christmas is a prime "meet the family" time,' says Laura, 'It depends on how new the relationship is of course, but if you've been together a while and the time is appropriate to meet the family yet they suddenly end the relationship, this suggests that they didn't want it to get this serious this soon - or not at all and so slammed on the breaks. 

'Meeting the family can signify taking the relationship to the next stage. It's likely that they just didn't want that.'If you find yourself dumped for this reason, although it hurts now, just keep in mind it's for the best, as the two of you clearly had different visions about where the relationship was going.

'It's better that it ended sooner rather than later where you would have got even more invested in it. If your partner was concerned that it was moving too quick, they should have communicated this to you so that you could both discuss how or if to move forwards together. You're better off being single (even at Christmas!) than in a relationship that isn't right for you.'

...But they also don't want you to meet theirs

This family issue isn't one sided, claims Laura: 'The idea of introducing you to their family can also highlight to them just how serious the relationship is getting. It could force them to evaluate it and realise it isn't what they want. There might also be an element of them worrying about what their family think of you.'

'If you've been finished with and you think this could be the reason, try hard to not get into the "I'm not good enough" mindset. You are! Don't you want to be with someone who can't wait to introduce you to their family? You're a catch and you want to be with someone who treats you as such! 

'If the reason is that they are worried about what their family will think of you, wouldn't you rather be with someone who has their own mind and stands up for who and what they want? Again, perhaps lack of communication about the relationship was missing. It looks like the two of you had very different visions, so you're much better out of this now and can go into the new year with a fresh start.' 

They don't want to buy you a gift 

Laura explains that whilst this may seem like a ridiculous reason to break up with someone, it can reveal bigger issues about the relationship. She says: 'It can force your partner to realise how little effort they want to spend on finding you the perfect gift and lead them to think about how much they really value the relationship. 

'Or it can be as simple as the fact they’re selfish! If you are the one who has been dumped for this reason, you're much better off being single than with someone who doesn't value you enough. It's not about expensive gifts (or shouldn't be) but more the thought that goes into them, and if they can't put the effort in, they're not the right person for you. Use the money or time you were going to spend on them on yourself this Christmas instead!'

The curse of the Christmas party affair 

Although we might not like to admit it there is a chance that you might fail prey to a Christmas affair. 'The work Christmas party is prime one for cheeky kisses under the mistletoe…and sometimes more,' Laura explained. 'People can get carried away in the haze of the free champagne and go on to do something they may regret.'

'How to deal with this one if you find yourself being the victim of being cheated on? Well, Christmas or not, cheating is cheating! Although it hurts now, you've had a lucky escape as you don't want to be with someone who after a few glasses of free booze will be tempted to stray'

Laura says that even if you do go through a break up this Christmas it doesn't mean you have have to give up all hope. Here's her top five tips for getting through the festive season on your own:

1. Appreciate your family 

Laura says: 'Christmas is a time for family and friends so make an effort to reconnect with them and enjoy the time you spend with them. Really try and appreciate this time because it’s what Christmas is all about.'

2. Socialise! 

Laura says: 'Christmas is the one time of year where you can get dressed up to your heart's content and if you're single, you can go exactly where you want and when. Pamper yourself, treat yourself to an amazing outfit for the season, do things for yourself that make you feel great and get some social events to look forward to in the diary with friends.'

Laura says that socialising with your friends is a great way to pull yourself out of the post split blues 

3. Lend a helping hand

Laura says: 'Volunteer or do something for others. If you're feeling down about being single at Christmas, do something positive for someone else. Whether it's helping out at a local charity over Christmas or volunteering for a few hours at a shelter, it will be amazing how much of a renewed perspective you'll get.'

4. Set goals

Laura says: 'Christmas and New Year are the perfect time for thinking about changes you want to make in the year ahead. If you don't want to be single, what can you do to change that? Can you try online dating, go to singles events or plan to do things that will widen your social circle and greater your chances of meeting someone? Aim to do things that will make you feel more fulfilled in general. Try new things. You're far more likely to meet someone who you really connect with when you have positive things going on in your life than when you're dwelling on being single.

5.Embrace the term 'single'

Don't stress and see it as a positive! Right now, you can't change the fact that you're single but you can change the way you perceive it. You have complete freedom to do what you want, when you want so make the most of that! Now is the time that you have the ability to be completely selfish about doing what you want - for you, so embrace it! If this is your first Christmas being single and you're finding it hard, do something or go somewhere during the holiday season out of the ordinary to mark a new start and create fresh memories.
