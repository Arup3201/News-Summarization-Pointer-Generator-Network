Deal: Chancellor George Osborne said the Government was committed to tackling tax evasion, as it announced a deal with authorities on the Isle of Man that will see financial information on taxpayers passed to HMRC

Tax dodgers hiding money on the Isle of Man will be forced to admit that they are evading tax or face huge penalties.

The Government yesterday struck a deal with Manx authorities in an attempt to clamp down on tax evasion that could see millions of pounds in unpaid bills recouped.

Under the arrangement, financial information on taxpayers will automatically be sent to HM Revenue and Customs.

But the inclusion of a 'disclosure facility' means that individuals will have three years to pay outstanding bills before their details are passed to authorities who could impose penalties of 200 per cent.

It is understood that those who do come forward will still be met with fines, albeit much smaller ones, despite being immune from prosecution.

Unpaid tax from 2009 for those who come forward is expected to carry a 10 per cent penalty, while affairs dating back to 1999 will incur fines of 20 per cent.

The disclosure facility will open on April 6 and is expected to close on September 2016.

The Treasury said the deal with the 
Manx authorities closely followed an agreement struck with the United 
States to improve international tax compliance.

Discussions are also taking place with
the authorities in Jersey and Guernsey on improving the exchange of 
financial information.

Chancellor George Osborne reinforced a commitment to tackling tax evasion, saying that the agreement will 'greatly enhance HMRC's ability to clamp down on those who try to hide their money offshore'.

He added: 'I welcome the progress made
with the Isle of Man and look forward to working on this new standard 
in the automatic exchange of tax information.'

Incentive: The inclusion of a 'disclosure facility' means that individuals hiding money on the Isle of man will have three years come forward and pay outstanding bills

The move follows an agreement last month with Switzerland to recover previously unpaid UK tax on funds held in Swiss accounts which is forecast to bring in more than Â£5 billion over the next six years.

Mr Osborne said: 'The agreement builds on the groundbreaking work we have already carried out - the UK Government has signed agreements with the US and Switzerland so far and we are in discussions with Jersey and Guernsey as part of our common commitment to combat tax evasion.'

The Government has said that enhancing international tax transparency will be one of the key themes of Britain's presidency of the G8.
