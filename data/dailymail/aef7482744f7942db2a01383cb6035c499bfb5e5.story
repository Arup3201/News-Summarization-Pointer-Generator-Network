Michelle Smart, pictured, allegedly threatened her boyfriend with a gun after he rebuffed her sexual advances over Valentine's Weekend

A South Carolina woman was arrested over Valentine's Weekend after she threatened to shoot her boyfriend who fell asleep after spurning her sexual advances. 

Michelle Smart, 29, of Spartanburg, South Carolina, is alleged to have threatened Ryan Rucker with his own gun after he refused to have sex with her. 

Deputies from Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office arrested Smart following the incident on February 15. 

Smart told police that she had 'attempted to make some sexual advances toward Mr Rucker' but he 'pushed her off him'. 

She claimed that Mr Rucker had punched and kicked her several times and she was forced to flee the house and sat in a truck outside the $78,000 home. 

Smart told deputies that her boyfriend had threatened to shoot her, but she did not wish to make a statement. 

However, according to Deputy Castillo, he and several deputies knocked on the door of the house. 

In a statement, Deputy Castillo said: 'Mr Rucker came to the door and was not visibly upset. Mr Rucker explained that he was asleep when Ms Smart made sexual advances on him. He stated that he pushed her off and the tow started arguing. 

'Mr Rucker stated that the argument escalated and that he followed Ms Smart outside. He stated that Ms Smart got into the truck and that she would shoot him because she has the gun.' 

Mr Rucker told deputies that he went back into the house because he was in fear for his life, although he did not wish to make a formal complaint against his girlfriend.' 

According to Deputy Castillo: 'Ms Smart continually was changing her story throughout the investigation. 

She advised that Mr Rucker had gone walking away when in fact he was inside the house. She stated that she thought he had the gun, and tournd out that the gun in question was in her presence the entire time. 

'For these reasons, Ms Smart's account became less believable throughout the investigation.' 

Deputy Castillo said he arrested Smart for Criminal Domestic Violence of High and Aggravated nature. 

Deputy Castillo said he recovered Mr Rucker's Ruger hand gun and six bullets and placed them into evidence.  

Deputies arrested Smart outside this $78,000 house in Spartanburg, South Carolina on Sunday
