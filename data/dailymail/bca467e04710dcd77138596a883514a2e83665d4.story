Shamed: Max Clifford, pictured after being convicted of eight indecent assaults, allegedly carried around a book of celebrity sleaze

Max Clifford protected himself from scrutiny with a 'little brown book' crammed with damaging allegations against celebrities - at the same time he was indecently assaulting teenage girls, it has been claimed.

The shamed PR guru would allegedly use the book as 'insurance' and proof that he was untouchable, according to a former detective who passed information to the Operation Yewtree investigation into Clifford's offending.

Mark Williams-Thomas, a former police investigator and crime expert, presented a documentary on paeodphile Jimmy Savile, which led to him being contacted with claims about Clifford,Â  which included details of the book.

The book is said to contain details of celebrities who had affairs, and a claim from a teenage rent boy that a very high-profile pop star had paid him for sex.

The claims were said to relate to his own celebrity clients, and were harvested through the 1980s and 1990s.

Mr Williams-Thomas said: 'He kept it as insurance to protect himself. The more Max knew, the more he could protect himself.'

Clifford, 71, was jailed for eight years on Friday for eight years after being convicted of a string of sex offences.

A jury at Southwark Crown Court found him guilty of eight indecent assaults, which took place on four victims aged 15 to 19 between the years of 1978 and 1984.

The court heard how Max thought he was 'untouchable' because of his celebrity links, which allowed him to intimidate his victims into staying silent for more than 30 years. It was heard that after assaulting the women he would warn that nobody would believe them if they spoke out.

Sentencing, Judge Anthony Leonard QC said: 'I judge that the reason why they were not brought to light sooner is because of your own dominant character and your position in the world of entertainment.'

'Your victims thought you were untouchable, something I judge that you, too, believed and traded upon'.

Mr Williams-Thomas said that he leaned of the book - said to have given the influential agent the same power over celebrities he exerted on his victims - because an alleged victim had been drafted in by a panicked Clifford to track it down after he misplaced it.

Speaking to The Sun, Mr Williams-Thomas said: 'One woman who I interviewed explained the power and control that Max had over her and so many other people.

'She described an occasion when she was out with him and he lost his book containing secrets - a "little brown book" of scandalous evidence against stars.'

He said the woman was eventually able to track the book down in a London restaurant the same night it was lost - in the early 1980s - bringing 'palpable' relief to Clifford.

During Clifford's trial the jury heard how he would intimidate his young victims with his showbusiness connections, and pressure them into performing sex acts on him by telling them he could win them parts in films.

One victim, who spoke to the Daily Mail under the psueodnym Cathy Johnson, said that she met Clifford on holiday, and he invited her into his office with acting and modelling opportunities.

There he forced her to strip for him. He later charmed her parents into letting him drive her around London, where he would park in dark allies and force her into sex acts.

Another victim, Sharon Elliott, waived her anonymity to tell the Mail on Sunday how Clifford offered her the chance to become a Bond Girl. He then led her into a toilet cubicle in a London night club and forced her to perform a sex act on him.

In the wake of his trial, even more women are said to have opened up to police about further assaults by Clifford - which could result in him facing further charges.

Police sources have said that as many as ten new victims have come forward while the trial was in progress and after his conviction, and that Operation Yewtree investigators were 'inundated'.

One source told the Sunday Mirror: 'More women are coming forward all of the time. The total could easily pass double figures'.

The Metropolitan Police told MailOnline: 'New information has been received, which Operation Yewtree investigators are currently assessing'.
