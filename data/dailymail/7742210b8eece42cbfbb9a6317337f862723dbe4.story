Russia manager Fabio Capello will be forced to appear before parliament to explain the country's dismal showing at the World Cup in Brazil.

The head of the State Duma's Sports Committee, Igor Anansikh, says he will demand Capello explain to lawmakers how he intends to improve the Russian side and make them more competitive.

Under Capello, Russia failed to win a game in Brazil - drawing 1-1 with both Algeria and South Korea, as well as losing 1-0 to Belgium - and finished third, leading to a group stage exit.

Since 2008, Capello has earned £26m from his time as England and Russia manager, delivering just a solitary World Cup victory over two campaigns.

Capello signed a new £7million-a-year contract extension in January which ties him to the Russian Football Union (FUR) until 2018 - when the country will host the World Cup for the first time.

The FUR expect the team to be competitive by the time the country hosts football's biggest tournament in four years' time and parliament will seek assurances over how the Italian intends to turn their fortunes around.

But if the FUR were to terminate Capello's contract then they could be forced to pay the Italian £15m in compensation.

Amazingly, before his contract renegotiation Capello would only have been due £3m if he had been sacked, according to ITAR-Tass.

And when he was in charge of England, Capello was paid an estimated £6m-a-year.

Since January 2008 when he accepted the Three Lions job, Capello has been paid close to £26m and has delivered just a solitary win over two World Cup campaigns.

The vast sums Capello has been paid have led to the Russian ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovski brandishing him as a 'thief'.

Russian politician Oleg Pakholkov has also demanded that the Italian returns all - or at least half - of the £10m he has received from the Russian Federation for the delivery of a 'shameful' result.

Anansikh also that told R-Sport and Lenta.ru that he believed 'the current Russia team is one of the weakest in the last 15-20 years'.

Capello, however, defended his record as Russia manager and how his side performed at the World Cup upon their exit.

The 68-year-old said: 'With this team we got to the World Cup for the first time in 12 years.

'I think I did a good job so far and it is a pity that we could not go forward.'
