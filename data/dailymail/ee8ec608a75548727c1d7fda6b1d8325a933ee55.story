Lluvia Paloma Rodriguez, 29, was found guilty of biting off her sister Ivon's nose and sentenced to five years' probation

A woman found guilty of biting off her sister's nose will not serve a prison sentence, a court heard today.

Lluvia Paloma Rodriguez, 29, bit off the nose of her sister, Ivon Rodriguez, in July last year when Ivon intervened in an argument between Rodriguez and her husband.

Ivon's nose was completely severed from her face, and needed four operations to reattach and reconstruct it using cartilage and skin.

Rodriguez was found guilty of felony aggravated assault of a family member.

The maximum sentence for the crime is up to 20 years in jail.

But Rodriguez walked free from court with a sentence of five years' probation, 240 hours of community service and she must pay a $500 fine.

She must also pay $62,000 in restitution to her sister and write her letter of apology for biting off her nose.

The assault occurred when Ivon intervened in an argument between Rodriguez and her husband at their home in northwest Houston.

Rodriguez first bit into her sister's arm, before severing her nose, in an act she claims was self defense because she believed Ivon was going to kill her.

A case document stated: ‘The defendant assaulted (her sister) by biting her arm with her teeth.

Ivon Rodriguez showed signs of surgery to her nose as she appeared in court to testify against her sister

'The defendant then bit the (victim's) nose off, severing it and detaching her nose from her face, causing pain and serious bodily injury.’

During the prosecution statements Rodriguez was described as a 'mean angry drunk' by attorney Beth Exley, while attorney Adam Brodrick described the assault as a 'vicious animal-like attack'.

The victim underwent surgery at Ben Taub Hospital, where doctors successfully reattached her nose over a series of operations, and she is expected to need two further surgeries.

Ivon's facial scars were visible in court on Monday when she testified against her sister, who was detained at the Harris County Jail prior to the trial.
