Over 450 classic Chevys were up for auction this weekend in the middle of a Nebraska field.

Despite many vehicles being covered in dirt and worn-down, visitors flocked to Pierce, Nebraska, to see the collection.

An estimated 10,000 people travelled to see the cars, and more than 3,800 registered online to bid on an auction website by mid-day on Saturday, Associated Press reports.

The first vehicle sold — a sky-blue, 1958 Chevy Cameo pickup driven 1.3 miles — secured the largest bid at $140,000, Associated Press says. Another bidder spent $97,500 on a red and white 1963 Impala with 11.4 miles on its odometer. Its original price was $3,254.70.

Six of the most valuable models sold for a combined $545,000.

Every hotel within 100 miles was booked, and some homeowners in Pierce have even rented out spare rooms for car lovers, KCAU-TV says.

The vehicles were once owned by the late Ray Lambrecht, 96, who was the local Chevrolet dealer for 50 years.

Lambrecht stored any unsold new vehicles up until his retirement in 1996. Reuters reports that more than 430 vehicles were pulled out of a grove where they were stored. Another 50 cars in better condition were moved out of storage sheds.

Lambrecht opened his dealership in 1946, Fox News reports, as GM expanded its franchises nationwide. Facing health problems, Lambrecht finally decided to sell his collection.

'It's kind of like marrying off your daughter,' auctioneer Yvette VanDerBrink said. 'Some daughters you want to get rid of and some you don't. For car guys, the cars are their babies. So he was watching all of his girls go away.'

All the cars must go, and if they're not sold, they'll be destroyed, according to CBS.

Even if some of the cars are destroyed, they will nonetheless make history -- the History Channel broadcast the auction as 'History Made Now: Wheels of Fortune' on Saturday evening.
