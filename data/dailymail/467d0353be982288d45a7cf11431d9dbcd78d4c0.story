Marc Albrighton has been released by Aston Villa with Premier League newcomers Leicester City his likeliest destination.

The winger has been with Villa since he was nine but his contract expired this summer and, as Sportsmail revealed on May 9, the Championship winners are understood to be keen on bringing him to the King Power Stadium on a free transfer.

Albrighton, the former England Under-21 international, would receive an improved wage at Leicester with Villa failing to offer fresh terms despite his positive end to the Premier League campaign.

The 24-year-old was sent on loan to Wigan for a month last October, only making four appearances, but returned and was one of the brightest playerâ€™s under Paul Lambert during the survival run-in.

Leicester need to strengthen in the wide areas with experienced Lloyd Dyer, 31, looking elsewhere when his contract expires next month.

Albrighton matches the profile of players manager Nigel Pearson looks for given his youth, fitness, and level-headedness. He would compete for a starting berth with Anthony Knockaert and Riyad Mahrez.

Leicester are also poised to bid for Sheffield United's teenage striker Diego de Girolamo. The 18-year-old is an Italy Under 19 international but was born in Chesterfield.

Striker Nathan Delfouneso has also been deemed surplus to requirements by Vila boss Paul Lambert.

Lambert said: 'We wish Marc the best in his future career and acknowledge the contribution he has made to the club over the past several years having graduated from our academy.'

Delfouneso, another academy graduate who spent last season on loan at Coventry, departs after 50 appearances following his debut, aged 17, in the UEFA Cup tie against Icelandic side FH Hafnarfjorour in August 2008.

Lambert added: 'We also wish Nathan the best for his career and thank him for his efforts since he, too, graduated from our academy.'
