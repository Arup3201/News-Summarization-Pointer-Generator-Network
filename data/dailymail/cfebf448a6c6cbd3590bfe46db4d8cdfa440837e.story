A rat-infested and toxic Russian cruise ship cast adrift in the Atlantic Ocean has apparently vanished.

The MV Lyubov Orlova - named after a Soviet actress - broke free in January when it was being tugged to be scrapped.

It was being tracked by US intelligence officials but has not been seen since March and there are fears it has sunk.

Sunk without trace: The MV Lyubov Orlova has been missing since January and is now presumed to be at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean

The luxury liner was being towed to the Dominican Republic from Newfoundland, Canada, when it slipped away as the crew on board the towing ship battled howling winds and 10ft
 waves to try in vain to reconnect the towing line.

The so-called 'ghost ship' was located briefly in February as it floated aimlessly about 500 miles off the coast of Ireland.

Then, in March, the Canadian Coast 
Guard reported that one of the ship's emergency radio beacons, which 
activate after hitting the water or another object, flashed a location 
almost 800 miles off Newfoundland, according to the Vancouver Sun.

With no further sightings, some are speculating the ship has sunk.

There are fears the vessel could be leaking toxic fluids into the 
water, according to French environmental organization Robin du Bois.

'In case of a collision or sinking or 
any accident, the Lyubov Orlova will immediately release fuel,other 
toxic liquids, asbestos, mercury and other non-degradable floating 
waste,' the group declared in a statement, according to LiveScience.

There has been confusion about which country is responsible for the 37-year-old luxury liner.

Canada's transport authority has said
 the abandoned ship is no longer its concern as the vessel has left the 
country's waters, with officials insisting the owner of the Orlova is 
responsible for its movements.

Court records obtained by the Globe and Mail newspaper show the vessel is owned by Hussein Humayuni, the owner of Neptune International Shipping Inc.

Now home only to rats, the 1976-built ship once carried passengers on Antarctic cruises.

The
 ship was seized by authorities in Newfoundland in 2010 amid spiraling 
debts owed to charter firm Cruise North Expeditions after faults on 
board meant a scheduled cruise had to be cancelled.

She is understood to have been sold to Neptune International Shipping in February last year to be broken up.

A supply vessel called the Atlantic Hawk was able to reconnect to the Orlova a short time later, only to have the cable fail again.

The ghostly liner was not seen again until about a month later, when a was spotted 1,300 nautical miles from Ireland's west coast.
