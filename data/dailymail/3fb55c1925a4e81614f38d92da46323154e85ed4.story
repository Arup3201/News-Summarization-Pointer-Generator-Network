Police chasing a suspected thief saw him flip his car before ploughing into a bus shelter at 92mph.

The spectacular crash was caught on camera by traffic officers following the white Fiat Grande Punto when it failed to stop in Birmingham at 1.30am on Saturday.

The car reached a top speed of 92mph as it weaved through quiet side streets to try and avoid them.

Footage taken from the front of a police car leading the chase shows the Punto flying away in the distance and careering around a roundabout

But just three minutes later, the 
driver crashed and overturned on the pavement outside a parade of shops 
in the Bordesley Green area of the city.

Shocking
 footage taken from the front of a police car leading the chase shows 
the Punto flying away in the distance and careering around a roundabout.

Seconds
 later the car can be seen clipping a kerb and flipping onto its roof 
before colliding with a bus shelter and coming to a halt.

The male driver and a female passenger in the Punto escaped with minor injuries and were in police custody within a few hours.

Releasing
 a 27-second video of the high-speed pursuit, West Midlands Police 
confirmed the pair had been bailed on suspicion of stealing the car.

The moment a white Fiat Punto hit a bus shelter during a police chase in Birmingham

The car came to rest after ploughing into a bus shelter. Police clocked its speed at 92mph

Investigating officer, Sergeant Andy Edwards, said: 'The two people in the Punto - a 31-year-old man and a 29-year-old woman - were soon pulled out by the emergency services and taken to hospital with what were thankfully only minor injuries.

'Both were in police custody within a few hours after being arrested on suspicion of stealing the car and today they were released on police bail pending further enquiries.

'To date we’ve not been able to identify the owner of the Punto - so we would be keen to hear from anyone who may be able to help us with our investigation.

'The car was being driven extremely dangerously and if anyone had been standing on that pavement at the time there could’ve been much graver consequences.

'The driver clearly had no regard for public safety so it was crucial the traffic officers, who are highly trained to drive safely at speed, brought him to a stop as soon as possible.'
