It may have started as a hobby, but one superhero fanatic is set to become a millionaire when he auctions off his prized collection of Marvel comics.

Doug Schmell is selling all 682 of his comics hoard, which is thought to be the world's most complete collection and are predicted to fetch a staggering $3million.

It includes pristine first editions of The X-Men, Fantastic Four, Daredevil and The Avengers - which introduced Wolverine, Iron Man and Captain America to the world.

And the mint comics - once sold for just 12 cents each - are now set to net their owner an eye-watering sum of at least £1.9million ($3 million).

Steve Borock, Senior Consignment Director of New York-based Heritage Auctions, who are selling the huge haul, said: 'I have watched Doug piece together this fantastic collection over the 20-plus years I have known him.

'When I saw the collection in its entirety, it was a thing of beauty.

Up for auction: A rare first edition copy of the X-Men, which introduced Wolverine and co to the world, alongside an equally rare first edition copy of the Avengers,  featuring Captain America

Avengers: Series 1-100 Ratings: 89 are 9.8 and 11 are 9.6

Daredevil: Series 1-100Rating out of 10: 90 are 9.8 and 10 are 9.6

Fantastic Four Series: 1-102Ratings: 94 are between 9.8 and 9.6

Journey Into Mystery: Series 83-125 Ratings: 40 are 9.8 and 9.6

Strange Tales: Series 101-168 Ratings: 64 are between 9.8 and 9.6

Tales of Suspense Series 39-99 Ratings: All are 9.8 and 9.6

Tales To Astonish: Series: £36-101 Ratings: 64 are between 9.8 and 9.6

Thor: Series: 126-200 Ratings: 72 are 9.8 and 3 are 9.6

X-Men: Series 1-66 Ratings: 61 are 9.8 and 5 are 9.8

'We expect there to be a hive of interest in this when bidding starts in July.

'Because of that we haven't set a reserve price, but are expecting the lot to fetch over $3million.'

The collection was painstakingly compiled by Mr Schmell, from Florida, USA, by trawling comic stores, online sales and meeting fellow dealers.

And the news that it is up for sale - with each individual piece on offer - has sent comic fans scrambling to get their hands on one.

His acquisitions date back to Marvel's 'Silver Age' - from 1956 to 1970 - with almost every comic in the set rated as the highest graded copy left in existence, according to the CGC census, which registers quality.

Incredibly, despite years of use, 
most of the comics' pages are still white or off-white, meaning they 
have not faded or been damaged since first bought.

And Mr Schmell, 49, added: 'I just felt it was time to part with it. I'm going to
be 50 soon and I can't take them to the grave so I thought I should 
pass them on and let other people enjoy the great story lines.

'Although
I sold the majority of my Bronze Age titles when I moved to Florida in 
2004, I kept and continued to add to my Silver Age runs, looking for 
upgrades on any individual issue whenever possible.

'The formation of this collection has been painstaking and took an incredible amount of effort, time, expense and patience.

Rare copy: Also up for sale is an early copy of the Fantastic Four, featuring Invisible Woman and Tales of Suspense introducing Iron Man

Times change: The back cover of all the first edition Marvel comics featuring an advertisement stating how readers could earn $50 - a far cry from its current value of millions in Florida

'The stories I could tell you of meeting at diners and post offices in Northern New Jersey, at office buildings and street corners in New York City to obtain that missing issue or coveted upgrade would blow your mind.

'My favourite has to be the 9.8 X-Men first edition. I love that whole run of comics and to own one in such perfect condition is rare.

'I sincerely hope the collectors who buy some of my books can enjoy them even half as much as I have.'
