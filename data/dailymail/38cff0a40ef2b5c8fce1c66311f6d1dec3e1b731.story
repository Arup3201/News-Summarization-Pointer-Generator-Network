One of Ed Miliband’s closest allies attempted to defend him yesterday after fresh attacks – but blundered by echoing an infamous sound bite used by ousted Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith.

Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna accused Mr Miliband’s Labour critics of ‘hysteria’ as Lord Prescott led a chorus of disapproval about his performance this summer.

Responding to Lord Prescott’s criticisms, Mr Umunna said: ‘We are talking loud and of course we will be turning up the volume even louder.’

Mr Duncan Smith tried to answer his critics at the 2003 Tory conference by declaring: ‘The quiet man is here to stay and he is turning up the volume.’ He was ousted 20 days later.

In a further blow to Mr Miliband, two polls yesterday found that fewer than half of Labour supporters think he is doing a good job.

ComRes found that 46 per cent of Labour supporters and just 22 per cent of voters as a whole believe he is a good leader of the Opposition.

The YouGov survey found that 49 per cent of Labour supporters approve of his performance, but 43 think he is ‘doing badly’. By contrast, 92 per cent of Tories think David Cameron is doing well.

But it is criticism from within his own party that Mr Miliband will find most wounding.

His former guru Lord Glasman – whom Mr Miliband ennobled – said that he needs to ‘grow up’ and start acting like a future prime minister. The peer said Labour was missing ‘open goals’ to hurt the Government.

He said: ‘When Labour should be showing the way ahead, it gives the impression of not knowing which way to turn.

‘When the Labour battle bus should be revving up, it is parked in the lay-by of introspection. It is time for Ed to show he is a grown-up politician big enough to lead this country.’

Mr Miliband has been on the back foot for several weeks after he and his senior shadow cabinet colleagues took time off while David Cameron and his top team toured the TV studios promoting policies.

Lord Prescott wrote yesterday: ‘This summer, we massively failed to get our case over to the public and hold the Tories to account. We missed open goals.

‘If shadow cabinet members aren’t pulling their weight, then give them the hairdryer treatment and kick them out.

‘Time
is running out. We can still turn it around and win in the second half.
But we need the very best team, week in, week out.’

Mr Umunna said he backed Mr Miliband ‘1,000 per cent’ to be leader at the next election, and dismissed the sniping.

He
said: ‘There has been somewhat of a hysteria around over the August 
weeks.

'We have got a lot more work to do over the next 90-odd weeks that
there are before the next general election to put our case to the 
British people, but that is precisely what we have been doing over the 
summer.’

will be able to vote in general elections if Labour wins in 2015, 
boosting the chances of a coalition with the Liberal Democrats.

Shadow
justice secretary Sadiq Khan, a close ally of Ed Miliband, revealed 
yesterday that Labour will fight the next election on a pledge to 
introduce the reform.

The Lib Dems are longstanding supporters of the plan to lower the voting age from 18 to 16.
