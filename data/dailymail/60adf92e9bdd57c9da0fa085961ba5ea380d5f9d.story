It looks like the ultimate Bond villain hideout - a lair where evil-doers such as Ernst Blofeld or Scaramanga might draw up their plans for world domination.

Yet this somewhat foreboding sight is in fact a rare aerial photograph of Mount Kilimanjaro, the dormant volcano that is the highest point in Africa.

The picture was taken by photographer Kyle Mijlof from 60,000ft as he flew over the 5,895m peak, which straddles the border of Kenya and Tanzania.

Mr Mijlof took the image through the window of his airplane with a Canon 5D mark II digital camera.

He might not have spotted any Bond villains but nevertheless he was pleased with his photograph.

South African Mr Mijlof said: 'Apparently we were very lucky to view the mountain like this and were only able to do one fly by.

'I have not seen any images of the mountain like this, only pictures from the base and from those lucky enough to climb to the summit, but never of the acid lake like I captured in this shot.

'It was such an epic sight.

'I have driven around the mountain twice and never saw it as cloud covered it both times.

'My friends who live in the area of Maun and around Arusha said they have only ever seen the mountain in full maybe twice as cloud covers it for most of the year.'

London-based photographer and tour 
guide Paul Goldstein, who last month ascended Kilimanjaro wearing a 9ft 
cuddly tiger for charity, said: 'I've seen many pictures of the mountain
before but pulling one off with this panache is difficult.'

Each
year, up to 25,000 climbers attempt to reach the summit of Kilimanjaro,
which can be found just 200 miles south of the Equator.
