Amir Khan wants to fight Kell Brook within the next year, paving the way for a spectacular return to Wembley Stadium for British boxing.

As recently as Monday Khan was talking down the chances of a grudge match between himself and Britain’s other leading welterweight, who has spent years calling out Khan.

But now there appears to be a genuine chance of this fight happening, with Khan saying on Tuesday that a meeting is inevitable, either at the end of this year or in 2016.

After Kell Brook's victory over Jo Jo Dan on Saturday, he called out Amir Khan in a post-match interview

Brook demolished Dan in Sheffield, beating him in just four rounds to retain his IBF World Welterweight title

The bargaining tool of Brook’s IBF world title remains a draw for the Bolton fighter, but a major factor has been the public pressure, which has grown enormously since Brook demolished his mandatory challenger Jo Jo Dan on Saturday.

With that in mind, it remains to be seen how much of what Khan is saying is lip service. Certainly, Brook’s team are waiting for formal talks to start before they get excited about a fight they have long craved and which would surely match Carl Froch’s 2014 rematch with George Groves at Wembley.

Khan said: ‘I’d love to go in the ring and fight Kell Brook. It will happen within the next 12 months but I have already given my word to an opponent and I want to be a man of my word.

‘After watching his (Brook’s) last performance, I know I can do a deal, winner takes all. It shows it is not about the money, it is about the pride. It could be his last fight, I would give him that much of a beating.’

Khan's last fight came against Devon Alexander in December, whom he beat to take his record to 30-3

Khan has previously refused a fight with Brook, but now promises it will take place within 12 months

He added: ‘It’s all about timing: if I’ve got a different route and I want to face the likes of the (Floyd) Mayweathers and (Manny) Pacquiaos out there, then Kell Brook will have to wait.’

Khan also tweeted: 'They doing a very good job making the public believe i don't want the fight, trust me i do! Keep building the hype cause winner takes all!' 

Any plans promoter Eddie Hearn had of staging the fight on June 13 - he has a provisional booking with Wembley - are scuppered by Khan’s claim to have promised a fight to a different opponent. He is expected to announce his next fight this week.

Sportsmail understands Khan would have made £4.5million from a June date with Brook, but with the rivalry likely to rumble loudly into 2016 he could take up to £5m. Brook’s camp are in talks with Mexican legend Juan Manuel Marquez over a summer fight, while WBA regular champion Keith Thurman and Brandon Rios are also possibilities.
