'Illustrious horsewoman' Patricia 'Paddy' Muir (pictured riding a different horse) facing £150k bill for selling a mount 'not fit for purpose in 2007

A champion showjumper sold one of her riding pupils an elderly horse that was ‘ready for the knacker’s yard’, a court heard.

John Palmer claims the ‘defective’ horse had to be put down just months after he bought it from three-day eventer Patricia ‘Paddy’ Muir.

Miss Muir now faces a huge £150,000 bill for legal costs after senior judges upheld Mr Palmer’s second appeal, after he lost the original case.

Mr Palmer, a financial adviser, of Corbridge, County Durham, launched court action against ‘illustrious horsewoman’ Miss Muir, a previous winner of the Blenheim Palace horse trials, claiming she sold him a mount which was ‘unfit for purpose’, in 2007.

However, Miss Muir, who runs a riding stable at Stokesley, North Yorkshire, insisted she had never owned the horse – a 14-year-old hunter named Toby – and that she merely acted as an agent for Mr Palmer in the purchase, at his request. She denied any responsibility for Toby’s state of health or that he ‘lacked merchantable quality at the time of sale or was unfit for purpose’.

Mr Palmer lost the argument after two court hearings, but senior judges in London have now upheld his appeal, opening a new chapter in the enormously costly legal saga. Appeal Court judge, Sir Stanley Burnton, decried the legal costs of the case – estimated at £150,000.

‘This is in many ways a sad case. The claim is for less than £9,000,’ he observed. ‘We are now hearing a second appeal in this case - in which the costs by now must inevitably be many times the value of the claim.’

Mark Anderson QC, for Mr Palmer, said his client had asked Miss Muir to ‘keep an eye out’ for a suitable mount for him to use as a novice in eventing and initially agreed to pay £5,000 for Toby in the belief that he was an 11-year-old. He added that Mr Palmer, 55, later dropped the price to £2,750 after seeing the horse’s papers and learning he was 14.

After buying and riding the horse, Mr Palmer found it had an ‘abnormal hopping gait’, which caused him to occasionally lose balance while riding.

Mr Anderson said: ‘The horse went lame shortly after Mr Palmer bought it and was put out to grass thereafter.’ After a vet declared Toby unsuitable to ride, he was put down in June 2008 for medical reasons.

Mr Anderson told the court that a post-mortem examination of the animal revealed that one of its front feet was bigger than the other.

The barrister told the judges: ‘Mr Palmer bought a horse which turned out to be of unsatisfactory quality and unfit for its purpose.

‘He says he bought it from Miss Muir in the course of her business as a horse trainer and occasional dealer and that the sale was therefore subject to the statutory implied terms as to quality and fitness.’

Patrick Limb QC, for Miss Muir, told the court that the showjumper did not own the horse and that Mr Palmer should have known that.

‘Though an illustrious horsewoman, with considerable equine knowledge, Miss Muir was merely seeking to help him find a horse in response to requests that she source one for him,’ the barrister said.

At the original hearing, a judge found in favour of Miss Muir, who regularly competes at Badminton.

Mr Palmer appealed but this was dismissed by a county court judge.

Sir Stanley, sitting with Sir Terence Etherton and Lord Justice Kitchin, said the ‘vital points’ in deciding the case were ‘the nature of the agreement and whether the horse was in fact defective’.

Allowing Mr Palmer’s appeal and sending the case back to be re-heard, Sir Stanley concluded: ‘There was no sensible finding of fact as to the condition of Toby at the point of sale.

‘I see no alternative but for the case to be remitted to the County Court for re-hearing by a different judge.’

Outside court, Mr Palmer said: ‘I  would never have bought it if I had known what it was – it was ready for the knacker’s yard.’
