The remains of a 2,000-year-old Native American village unearthed by archaeologists may be one of the most 'significant' prehistoric discoveries ever made in America.

The Tequesta Indian site was first discovered back in 2005, when developers began excavation at what had been a parking lot.

Since then they have uncovered eight circles of holes in the limestone bedrock where supports for huts may once have stood.

Site of historical importance: Archaeologists have discovered eight large uniformly carved circle holes in limestone in downtown Miami, which are believed to be the foundation holes for Tequesta Indians dwellings dating as far back as 2,000 years

Archaeologist Robert Carr said: 'What’s unusual and unique about the site is that it’s this huge chunk of land where a major part of this ancient Tequesta village site is preserved.

'It’s one of the earliest urban town plans in eastern North America. You can actually see this extraordinary configuration of these buildings and structures.’

But the discovery of the village, situated where downtown Miami meets Biscayne Bay, has thrown a wrench into a multibillion-dollar development project by the Miami-based MDM Development Group.

The ancient site sits in the heart of Miami's latest real estate boom surrounded by luxury condo towers with names like Icon and Epic.

Across the street is a luxury JW Marriott Marquis hotel, where professional basketball players stay when in town to play the Miami Heat, as well as some of Miami's newest high-end restaurants, where celebrities are spotted nightly.

'Birthplace of Miami: The remains of the Royal Palm Hotel, one of the first hotels to ever be built in the area in 1897, has also been discovered on the site

MDM's plans for the site of the newly 
discovered Tequesta circles include a movie theater, restaurants and a 
34-story hotel covering an entire city block, including the 
archaeological site.

The tower is part of the four-phase Met Miami project, which includes the already completed JW Marriott, an office building anchored by Wells Fargo and a 447-unit condo tower overlooking Biscayne Bay.

But this discovery may put a stop to the plans as the city of Miami is under pressure to revisit permits issued to the developer in hopes changing the design to preserve the ancient village.

Over the past nine years archaeologists have uncovered thousands of artifacts - as well as human bones - that show the Tequestas conducted trade with other parts of North America and the Caribbean.

Preservationists claim there is growing support for the site to be saved and turned into an exhibit

The MDM Development Group plans to build movie theaters, restaurants, and a 34-story story on the site - but archaeological discoveries in the area may prevent it from going ahead

'Accounts by Spanish (explorers) 
describe huts, a heathen, savage people. The big surprise is we're 
finding a very sophisticated people living in one location for a fairly 
long period of time,' Carr said.

Archaeologists also found the foundation
 of the Royal Palm Hotel at the site, built in 1897 by industrialist 
Henry Flagler, who is widely credited with establishing Miami. Badly 
damaged in the hurricane of 1926, the Royal Palm was demolished in 1930.

The Tequesta tribe lived near Biscayne Bay, in the area now known as Miami, and they also occupied the Florida Keys.

It is believed the Tequesta tribe arrived in the Biscayne Bay area, now known as Miami, before the beginning of the Current Era.

The Tequesta situated their towns and camps at the mouths of rivers and streams, on inlets from the Atlantic Ocean to inland waters, and on barrier islands and keys. They are also believed to have occupied Florida Keys.

Like the other tribes in Florida, the Tequesta were hunters and gatherers. They relied mainly on fish, shellfish, nuts, and berries for food.

During the 1500s, Europeans began arriving in Florida.

A map produced by the Dutch cartographer Hessel Gerritsz in 1630 labeled the Florida peninsula as 'Tegesta' after the tribe.

European estimations of the population of the Tequesta varied between 800 and 10,000 but the tribe had disappeared by the time Britain took control of Florida from the Spanish in 1763.

Preservationists say there is strong and
 growing support for measures to save and create a major exhibit around 
at least some of this new archaeological site.

The
 city's Historic and Environmental Preservation Board is expected to 
discuss the proposed development at a meeting this week, and a vote 
could be held later this month.

'It’s extremely important. If they gave it a name, it’s the birthplace of Miami,' said city preservation board member Gerald Marston.

The developers have proposed carving out a slab of the limestone holding one or two of the larger circles on the site and displaying it once the building is complete.

The Historic and Environmental Preservation Board could recommend that the city take back the property. In a statement, the developer said that would be a mistake.

'The cost to us of a full or partial taking of this property is far greater than the public would ever be willing to spend,' MDM said. 'Imposing such a staggering burden on a single company is neither lawful nor acceptable,' it added.  

A similar circle of holes drilled into 
the rock, called the Miami Circle, was uncovered nearby in 1998 and is 
thought to have once been a ceremonial Tequesta meeting place for the 
native American tribe.

That discovery led to a developer being forced to
 sell the land back to the city. The site is now a city park.

Miami's Historic and Environmental Preservation Board could hold a vote on the future of the site later this month
