As the FBI arrived in Charlottesville on Tuesday to join the search for missing UVA student Hannah Graham, police in the Virginia town changed their focus to the Irish bar she was last seen near.

Working off a tip of a possible sighting, Charlottesville police Captain Gary Pleasants said that his officers are examining surveillance footage from McGrady's Pub near to the college campus recorded at around 12.45am on Saturday.

That is 35 minutes before Hannah's last text to friends telling them she had become lost trying to join them at a party on the college campus and comes as authorities admit the teen is at least the fourth young woman to go missing in the area in the past five years.

Pleasants confirmed the new report of a sighting outside the pub as her parents, who are from England, issued a statement regarding the second-year student's disappearance.

'Since learning of Hannah’s disappearance, we have been heartbroken and at the same time heartened by the outpouring of support and help we have received. We remain hopeful that Hannah will be found soon,' said her father John, mother Susan and brother James Graham in a joint statement.

'Those of us who know and love Hannah know that she would not disappear without contacting family or friends.

'She is highly responsible and organized. She embraces life with energy and enthusiasm and has enriched the lives of many.

'Her empathy is evident in her daily interactions with us and her friends. She loves the University of Virginia, and all summer she was looking forward to the start of the new school year.

'We express our sincere gratitude to law enforcement and everyone who is involved in the search for Hannah. We also thank the University for the full attention they are devoting to the situation.'

Also on Tuesday authorities asked local residents to check their property for any clues, including in bushes and under any tarps if they have any. 

On Monday night, Charlottesville Police released images of Hannah recorded on a surveillance camera inside her own apartment block.

They are from around 9pm and later on Friday Hannah attended a party with a male friend just a few blocks away.

'She had been drinking quite a bit,' said Charlottesville Police Captain Gary Pleasants to WRIC.

'She told him that she was leaving and going home. He asked if he could walk her home and she said no she was fine. He stayed and she left.'

Over the next 35 minutes she sent increasingly erratic texts to her friends.

'One text message said, 'I'm lost in the area of 14th and Wertland' which is the area she was in,' said Pleasants. 'It's in an area she's very familiar with.'

Just after 1.30 her phone was either switched off or ran out of batteries and she has not been heard from since.

'We are checking her cell phone record, computer, bank accounts, everything we can possibly do,' said Pleasants.

Virginia State Police and the Albemarle County Sheriff's Office were assisting as officials plan to resume the search. 

He said police have turned down many offers from the public to help with the search but are asking anyone with information to call the Charlottesville Police Department. 

Graham's parents are in Charlottesville, Pleasants said.

Search: Hannah was last heard from in the vicinity of McGrady's bar in Charlottesville, just north of the UVA campus

Appeal: Friends and family of the student have asked anyone with any information to call UVA police

Police said Graham's friends reported her missing Sunday after realizing nobody had seen or heard from her since early Saturday morning, when she sent a text message to a friend after leaving a party.

At least three other young women have disappeared in the area in the last five years. Nineteen-year-old Samantha Ann Clarke, who vanished after leaving her Orange County townhouse in September 2010, and 19-year-old DaShad Laquinn Smith, who disappeared in Charlottesville in November 2012, remain missing.

Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old Virginia Tech student, disappeared from the University of Virginia's John Paul Jones Arena while attending a rock concert in October 2009. Her remains were found three months later in a rural area. No arrests have been made.

The surveillance footage of Hannah shows her running inside her apartment block at 9.30pm on the night she went missing.

At the request of the family her address is not being made public. 

Footage shows what she was wearing on the night she disappeared. Police have said she was 'fairly well intoxicated', according to CBS6.

Her friend, Sophia Lamrissi-Garcia, who was partying with Hannah at one of her sorority events, told the station she had considered getting a cab home, but decided she would walk instead. 

'At that point in the night you think you’re doing the right thing walking alone but it’s not always the right decision to make', Sophia added.

Her neighbor, Sam Blum said that he is devastated and worried about her disappearance.

'I saw her on Thursday…she seemed really happy,' said Blum to WTVR. 'Downtown Charlottesville, I wouldn’t expect that.'

The search area for Hannah is being focused around 14th Street Northwest to Wertland Street, including the railroad tracks, near to the UVA campus.

That was where she sent her last text to friends explaining she was lost.

UVA President Teresa Sullivan released a statement Monday afternoon saying the university is both concerned and cooperating fully.

'The members of the University of Virginia community are united in our deep concern for a UVa student who is missing and has not been in touch with her family or friends since early Saturday morning,' said Sullivan according to the Roanoke Dispatch.

Students who didn't know Hannah said they were worried about what it means for campus security,

'I think it's real tragic when anything like this happens,' said Brannon Johnson, 4th year at the university to the Roanoke Dispatch.

'It definitely questions everything in terms of safety and how everyone is going to react and move around grounds for sure.'

'It kind of hit home that something like this can really happen,' said Madison Baril, 1st year at the university.

'Before it was kind of more like stories and warnings, but now it's a real person that's gone.

'If you are with a group of girls, make sure you leave with a group of girls,' said Baril. 'Find friends don't wander off with people you just met.'

Hannah, who is not a US citizen is 5'11" with blue eyes and light brown hair. She is said to live off campus

Hannah, who is not a US citizen is 5'11" with blue eyes and light brown hair. She lives off campus, is from Northern Virginia and resides in the US using a Green Card.

'As some of you may have heard, Hannah Graham is missing. She was last seen leaving Camden Plaza around 11:50 late Friday night and last heard from a little after 1am, Saturday,' one post shared on Facebook states. 

'On Sunday, her friends and family realized that none of them had seen or had contact with her since Friday night and a call was placed to the Emergency Communications Center by her friends, reporting her missing,' said Lt. Ronnie Roberts, of the Charlottesville Police Department to the Daily Progress.

'Police detectives responded immediately and have been working to find Hannah since learning of her disappearance. A search using a bloodhound was conducted Sunday evening, but that search did not turn up anything useful.'

Anyone with information is asked to call Charlottesville Police Department at 970-3280 or Crimestoppers at 977-4000.
