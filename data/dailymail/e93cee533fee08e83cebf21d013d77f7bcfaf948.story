Carlos Vela scored twice in his first international appearance since 2011 as Mexico exacted revenge for their controversial World Cup exit with a 3-2 victory against Holland.

And Vela was quick to get back on the scoresheet as Miguel Herrera's men held out for an exciting win.

The former Arsenal man put the visitors in front with a superb strike in the eighth minute and added a second goal in the 60th after Wesley Sneijder's sublime long-range equaliser.

Mexico upset Holland with a 3-2 victory at the Amsterdam ArenA in their international friendly

Holland: Krul, Van Rhijn, Vlaar (De Vrij 24), Veltman, Willems, Blind, Afellay (Wijnaldum 68), Sneijder (Fer 81), Huntelaar, Depay (Promes 60), Robben. Subs Not Used: Cillessen, van der Wiel, Bruma, Narsingh, De Jong, Vermeer.

Booked: De Vrij.

Goals: Sneijder 49, Blind 74.

Mexico: Ochoa, Aguilar, Reyes, Miguel Herrera (Corona 61), Alanis, Aldrete, Vazquez (Rodriguez 89), Hector Herrera (Dominguez 81), Guardado (Ponce 87), Vela (Giovani 76), Hernandez (Jimenez 76). Subs Not Used: Talavera, Jonathan, Gonzalez, Venegas, Corral.

Booked: Alanis, Ochoa, Aguilar.

Goals: Vela 8, 62, Hernandez 69. 

Javier Hernandez dribbled past goalkeeper Tim Krul to add a third with a simple finish after 69 minutes before Daley Blind's deflected long-range shot five minutes later reduced the deficit.

Defeat heaps more pressure on Dutch coach Guus Hiddink, who has come under increased scrutiny, after  defeat at the Amsterdam ArenA subjected them to a fourth loss in five matches since a third-placed finish at the World Cup. 

The last time a Dutch manager lost four of his first five games was also Hiddink during his first reign in 1995. 

Since taking over from Louis van Gaal, the former Chelsea boss has only three points from three Euro 2016 qualifying games. 

Holland turn their attention back to qualifying for Euro 2016 when they face Latvia in a Group A contest on Sunday. 

With one eye on that fixture Hiddink rested Robin Van Persie who reported a slight injury, but named an otherwise strong side, but Mexico emerged victorious - unlike the dramatic finish to their World Cup last 16 game in Fortaleza.

Last week Hiddink told a press conference he would quit if Holland fail to beat Latvia - just three months after succeeding Louis van Gaal as coach.

Holland are third in their Euro 2016 qualifying Group A, six points behind joint group leaders Iceland and the Czech Republic.
