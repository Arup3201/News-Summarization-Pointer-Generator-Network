Amanda Knox is 'very anxious' as Italy's supreme court today hears from prosecutors appealing her acquittal of the murder of British student Meredith Kercher, her lawyer said.

Prosecutors on behalf of the Kercher family say that the acquittals of Knox and her former boyfriend Raffale Sollecito in 2011 should be thrown out and a new trial ordered, calling those verdicts 'contradictory and illogical'.

Meredith, 21, from Coulsdon, Surrey, was
 found semi-naked with her throat cut and more than 40 wounds on her body in the bedroom of the house she 
shared with Knox and two other women in Perugia in 
November 2007.

She had arrived in Italy two months earlier to spend a year studying at the University for Foreigners as part of her degree at Leeds University. On the night of her death, she had watched a DVD with three fellow British students before returning to her rented accommodation.

'[Knox] is carefully paying attention to 
what will come out,' her lawyer Luciano Ghirga said as he arrived at 
Italy's Court of Cassation.

'This is a fundamental stage. The trial is very complex.'

Ghirga and Sollecito's lawyer Giulia Bongiorno said they were confident the 2011 verdict clearing their clients would be upheld by the court, which will rule only on procedural issues.

'There seems to be very little criticism of the technical aspects of the trial,' said Ghirga.

Bongiorno told reporters before the hearing: 'We have a verdict behind us that is so well-grounded, coherent and logical that we're very calm.'

Knox and Sollecito were convicted of Miss Kercher's murder in December 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively.

They were cleared in October 2011 after a fresh hearing uncovered a bungled police investigation. Defence lawyers and experts revealed how evidence had been contaminated or poorly handled by forensic teams and that the conviction should be considered unsafe.

The appeals court noted that the murder weapon was never found, said that DNA tests were faulty and added that Knox and Sollecito had no motive to kill Kercher.

Yesterday Meredith’s sister Stephanie
 said: ‘There are lots of questions without answers and that’s why we 
are looking for the truth.

Stephanie Kercher, Meredith's sister, said there were still 'unanswered questions' over her sister's death

‘We miss Meredith terribly and nothing will bring her back.

Diane Sawyer is still preparing for her interview with Amanda Knox for an ABC special, sources confirmed today.

The legendary journalist will interview the Seattle student next month to promote her new book.

The hour-long, pre-taped interview, will air on April 30 - the same day Knox's book, Waiting To Be Heard, is published.

‘We hope that the supreme court hearing will help to find some answers to what happened that night.

‘Meredith will never be forgotten but
 it’s also important not to forget what happened, a beautiful young 
girl, my little sister, taken away from us too early in a brutal manner,
 with many aspects to still clarify. 

The court could rule later today 
whether Knox, who now lives in Seattle, and Sollecito, who lives in 
Bisceglie, southern Italy, will be retried or if the case will be closed
 for good. A panel of judges will rule whether the Italian legal code was applied correctly and fairly in both trials.

If the case is closed, they could apply for compensation for unlawful imprisonment.

The hearing, held behind closed doors, will only consider paperwork and legal documents with no new witnesses giving evidence.

If the court does order a retrial 
Knox would not have to return to Italy as there is no requirement for 
defendants to be in court.

Knox and Sollecito have both 
maintained their innocence, though they said that smoking marijuana the 
night Miss Kercher was killed had clouded their recollections.

Their behaviour in the days following the death, including being pictured kissing, raised suspicion.

Prosecutors have alleged that Kercher was the victim of a drug-fuelled sexual assault.

A young drifter from Ivory Coast, Rudy Guede, was convicted of the slaying in separate proceedings and is serving a 16-year sentence. Ms Kercher's family have resisted theories that Guede acted alone.

The lawyer for the Kercher family, Francesco Maresca, was at the court today, as was Sollecito's father.

The court is also hearing Knox's appeal against a slander conviction for having accused Patrick Lumumba, a local pub owner, of carrying out the killing. He was held for two weeks based on her allegations.

Knox has written a book about her 
imprisonment and is due to give an interview to Diane Sawyer for American TV station ABC 
next month ahead of its release.

Publisher HarperCollins paid a $4million advance for the memoirs

Sollecito has also written a book and has already given an interview on Italian TV about the case.

He told interviewers that he and Knox were no longer a couple but they were still in touch.

He visited her in the United States at the end of last year and they speak on Skype regularly.

Sollecito resumed his studies in Verona and his father Francesco told reporters: 'He is calm and serene even if we are all in a state of apprehension.'

During the investigation and trial, prosecutors said Knox was highly sexual and had manipulated Sollecito but her lawyers dismissed the theory.
