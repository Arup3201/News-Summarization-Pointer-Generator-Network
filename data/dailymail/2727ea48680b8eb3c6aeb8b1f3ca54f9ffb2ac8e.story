For budding pop stars or rebellious teens, a tattoo is virtually a rite of passage.

Until now, the same could not be said of ageing BBC broadcasters.

But David Dimbleby has thrown convention to the wind at the ripe old age of 75… by having a scorpion inked onto his shoulder.

Last-minute regrets? David Dimbleby, 75, looks a little wary as he has his tattoo done

The veteran presenter said he decided to ‘man up’ and visit an east London tattoo parlour while filming his latest TV series Britain And The Sea for BBC1.

He was researching the history of Polynesian tribal tattoos, which were first brought to the UK by Captain Cook’s crew in the 18th Century, when a producer suggested he have one done himself.

Mr Dimbleby said he initially refused on the grounds he was too old, despite admitting it was a lifetime’s ambition. But he then decided to have a design to mark his star sign Scorpio.

He told Radio Times: ‘Instead they did something with black pencil that can be washed off. 

‘But when I saw it in a preview of the film I thought: “That’s a bit feeble.” I thought it was wimpish having it just drawn on and I needed to man up.’

Mr Dimbleby’s two-and-a-half inch tattoo cost £60 at the Vagabond tattoo agency in east London last month. 

He said: ‘It took about 30 minutes - an hour in all - and I thought of Winston Churchill having his done while mine was being done. It wasn’t painful at all, it just zings a bit.’

‘It’s modest. It can’t be seen unless I choose to show it to someone. I’m rather fond of it actually, this little scorpion sitting on my shoulder ready to attack my enemies.’

The co-owner of Vagabond, Rebecca Morris, told the Daily Mail Mr Dimbleby was ‘a pleasure to work on’.

She said: ‘He’s not someone who is representative of our client base, but we have had older people come to have tattoos. 

‘He was very light hearted and in high spirits. He dealt with the pain well - he flinched a few times but he was chatting all the way through.

‘It was nice to see him in a different light, he was friendly and approachable and much less serious than you would imagine.’

As well as presenting the BBC’s long-running Question Time series, Mr Dimbleby is known as the solemn anchor of nearly every televised state occasion.

He has presented every general election since 1979.

As a former member of The Bullingdon 
Club at Oxford University – whose elite alumni include David Cameron and
Boris Johnson – he is often seen as one of the BBC’s most Establishment
figures.

But the presenter revealed he is a secret connoisseur of body art, saying: ‘You are only old once. I have always wanted a tattoo.

'I thought I might as well have it done now. It’s a dream come true for me. It’s beautifully done, actually. It’s a work of art.’

Reaction: Mr Dimbleby said his second wife Belinda Giles, pictured, was 'mildly amused' by his tattoo

He added: ‘They have these 3D tattoos 
now that are done using photographs, which are just astonishing, but I 
wasn’t about to have one myself.

‘And then there’s Cheryl Cole’s bottom. I wasn’t tempted to have any private parts decorated, I have to tell you. I thought the shoulder was the most discreet place. I didn’t want it on my arm because it would show every time I rolled up my sleeve.’

Mr Dimbleby – who is the son of broadcasting legend Richard Dimbleby and the brother of BBC journalist Jonathan – lives in East Sussex with his second wife, Belinda Giles.

Asked what she made of his tattoo, he said: ‘I think she’s mildly amused. I believe she wanted a tattoo once, but has never got around to it. Maybe I’ll be able to persuade her.’

Mr Dimbleby is not the first famous septuagenarian to have a tattoo.

Last year, Lady Judy Steel, the wife of former Liberal Democrat leader David Steel, revealed she had a pink jaguar inked onto her shoulder, saying ‘you’re never too old to do mad things’.
