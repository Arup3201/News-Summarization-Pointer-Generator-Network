The final winner from among the three tickets that struck gold with all the matching numbers in this month’s $448 million Powerball jackpot has finally come forward.

The world already knew the third ticket had been sold in South Brunswick, New Jersey, but Mario Scarnici was not revealed to be the winning ticketholder from the August 7 drawing until Friday.

Scarnici’s name was buried deep in a New Jersey Lottery press release that listed winners of lesser amounts as well as the other winners from the historic August jackpot. Scarnici chose a lump sum cash option totalling $62 million after taxes.

Solved: There was no name on this cake displayed at the South Brunswick, New Jersey grocery store celebrating its sale of one of three tickets for the August 7 $448 million jackpot, but it has now been filled in

Scarnici, who lives in the Monmouth Junction area of South Brunswick, claimed the prize along with his two adult sons, according to New Jersey Lottery spokesman Judith Drucker.

According to CentralJersey.com and Drucker, details on the lucky winner are scant. This, paired with his apparent unwillingness to appear at a celebratory press event suggests Scarnici and his sons have no intention of publicizing their luck any further.

The same cannot be said for the other winners.

The first winner of the massive jackpot wasted no time in coming forward to claim his prize.

Name and a place: The Stop & Shop in South Brunswick, New Jersey sold one of three winning tickets for the third largest Powerball jackpot in history to Mario Scarnici

Still mysterious: Scarnici's name was slyly buried a page into a New Jersey Lottery press release Friday. Unlike the other winners, he has not held a press conference

A day after the numbers were picked, Paul White and his elated girlfriend and coworkers came forward at a Minneapolis press conference.

The beaming Ham Lake, Minnesota divorcee and dad held a novelty check made for the news cameras and envious public.

The next winning ticketholders to go public at least waited a few days to get their ducks in a row before their press conference.

But come forward they did.

Jubilant: Quite unlike Scarnici, one of the other winners, Paul White (here with partner Kim VanReese) of Minnesota all but ran to a press conference following his win

The Ocean’s 16, a group of 16 public employees from Toms River, New Jersey came forward the following week to claim their chunk of the winnings.

Like White had already done and Scarnici would soon choose to do, the Ocean’s 16 chose a lump sum.

Each will get about $3.8 million after taxes, Drucker said.

One among the 16, garage worker William Seeley, even achieved fleeting internet fame following the win.

Modest: William L. Seeley. an outspoken fan of Duck Dynasty and one of the Oceans 16 who won the other third of the jackpot holds their novelty check aloft

I quit: Sixteen New Jersey municipal workers won a third of the $448 million jackpot as a group, only the second time two jackpot winners came from the same state

Sporting a floppy straw hat covered in fishing lures, a T-shirt promoting the popular A&E reality show Duck Dynasty, camouflage pants, sun glasses and a long beard, Seeley gleefully proclaimed that he and his 15 co-workers were a ‘happy bunch’ at a New Jersey press conference.

'We're very happy, happy, happy,’ Seeley, said as he held a giant yellow check aloft and channelling the bearded Duck Dynasty patriarch Phil Robertson.

But for every Seeley and White, it seems, there is a Scarnici and we may never truly know the man behind the historic lottery win.

The August 7 drawing marked only the second time two Powerball jackpot tickets have ever been sold in the same state. In 1993, two winners came from Washington, DC.
