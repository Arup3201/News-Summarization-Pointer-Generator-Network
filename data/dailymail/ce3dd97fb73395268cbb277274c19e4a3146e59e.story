The Royal Navy’s most sophisticated warship has been ordered to the Falklands in a display of strength as tensions rise with Argentina.

Britain is sending the £1billion Type 45 destroyer Dauntless on a seven-month deployment to the South Atlantic while Buenos Aires ratchets up pressure over sovereignty of  the islands.

The vessel, which bristles with fearsome anti-aircraft weapons, will patrol the coastline during celebrations to mark the liberation of the islands 30 years ago.

Officials said sending out the Type 45 destroyer on her maiden voyage was not a response to increased tensions over the sovereignty of the islands and that it had been planned for a while

This will coincide with Prince 
William’s posting to the Falklands as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot – 
seen by Argentina as a provocative act.

And Foreign Office Minister 
Jeremy Browne has announced he will visit the Falklands in June for  the
 commemorations.

The Ministry of Defence confirmed that Dauntless would sail at the end of March, but insisted it was a ‘routine’ deployment.

After returning to work following a cancer scare, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernandez, wasted little time in attacking David Cameron's  'colonialism' statement, saying Britain didn't have 'reasons or arguments' 

In December, the Mercosur grouping of 
countries, which includes Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil and Paraguay, 
announced that it would ban ships sailing under the Falkland Islands 
flag from docking at their ports

The British people of Gibraltar should be barred from any talks over the future of the disputed colony, Spain has said. Mariano Rajoy, the country's new Prime
 Minister, risked a furious diplomatic row by insisting officials on the
 Rock should be excluded from sovereignty discussions.

David Cameron is facing fresh calls from Madrid to open negotiations on ownership of the territory. The UK premier angered Spanish MEPs 
last week by insisting that the future of Gibraltar would depend on the 
colony's 30,000 residents. Going against their wishes of the people - 
who have in the past voted to remain British - would amount to 
'recolonisation', he said.

But Mr Rajoy and Spain's new foreign 
minister José Manuel García-Margallo have vowed to raise demands for 
fresh talks with the EU. Mr Garcia-Margallo has already written
 to British Foreign Secretary William Hague stressing that there was no 
mention of self-determination for Gibraltans in the Treaty of Utrecht of
 1713.

Spain ceded Gibraltar to Britain in 
perpetuity under the treaty after the Napoleonic Wars. But Madrid has 
defiantly refused to recognise the agreement, which includes territorial
 waters three miles around the Rock, and has repeatedly tried to reclaim
 them.

Under the previous Labour Spanish 
government, the authorities in Gibraltar were included in three-way 
talks with Madrid and London. But the discussions stalled last year 
after clashes in waters near the Rock between the Royal Navy, Gibraltan 
police and Spain's Guardia Civil.

Earlier this month, Mr Garcia-Margallo made a sneaky jibe over the disputed sovereignty of Gibraltar in the European Parliament. As Tory Euro MP Charles Tannock rose 
to congratulate him on his appointment, the Spaniard quipped: 
'Gibraltar, Español.', which translates as 'Gibraltar, Spanish!'.

She is taking over from HMS Montrose,
 a Type 23 frigate which is far less powerful. However,  Naval 
commanders admitted sending the state-of-the-art warship to the region 
would deliver a strong signal that Britain had no intention of 
relinquishing the disputed territory.

A Navy source said: ‘Dauntless is an elite warship.

‘She is going to the Falklands on a 
routine deployment, but the fact that the Navy is sending her  and not 
one of the older warships is significant.’

Tensions between the two countries 
have heightened with the approaching 30th anniversary of the 1982 
Falklands conflict, which cost the lives of 255 British and 649 
Argentine servicemen.

Buenos Aires has recently renewed 
claims to the islands. It has imposed an economic blockade on Falklands 
fishing vessels, which have been repeatedly intimidated by Argentine 
warships.

The islands’ population of 3,000 want to remain British.

Tory MP Julian Brazier, a  member of 
the defence select committee, said: ‘This sends a very powerful and 
timely message to Argentina that Britain means business when it comes to
 defending the Falklands.’

A Royal Navy spokesman said: ‘The 
deployment of HMS Dauntless to the South Atlantic has  been long 
planned, is entirely routine and replaces another ship  on station.’

Admiral Lord Alan West, former First Sea
 Lord and Falklands veteran who led HMS Ardent when she was sunk by 
Argentina with the loss of 22 men, said: 'The Type 45s are becoming a 
key part of our modern force.

'The thing that is fascinating about them is they have got the most amazing anti-air warfare capability.

'Should
 there be any foolish nonsense from Argentina, Dauntless can sit just 
off the airfield and take down any aircraft coming in. It is a 
game-changing capability.'

Meanwhile
 former head of the Army, General Sir Mike Jackson said it would be 
‘just about impossible’ to retake the Falklands if Argentina invades.

General
 Sir Mike Jackson warned that defence cuts meant that the UK no longer 
has the capability to get the islands back if the Argentines secured the
 airfield.

The issue is especially sensitive as the 30th anniversary approaches of the liberation of the islands by Britain from an Argentine invasion
