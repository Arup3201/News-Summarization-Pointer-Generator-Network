A programming glitch in a popular football video game shrinks a 230 pound NFL linebacker to a less-then-intimidating 1 foot, 2 inches tall.

It's in the new Madden '15 in 'Solo Challenge' mode where Cleveland Browns linebacker Christian Kirksey is dwarfed during game play by all other players and even the ball.

Gamemaker EA Sports also happened to have the digital Kirksey play for Tennessee instead of the team that actually drafted him in 2014, leading many to come up with the same nickname: the Tiny Titan.

Team player: Christian Kirksey appears to play as well as any of his towering teammates in the game, despite the glitch

But don't let size fool you. Grabs from the game appear to show Kirksey playing just as well as his towering teammates--so what if the ball is as big as he is.

Fans of the wildly popular game have had a ball posting hilarious grabs of the Tiny Titan as he plays ball and even Kirksey himself has a sense of humor about it.

The St. Louis native tweeted about the glitch yesterday evening, writing:

'No matter how small you are, have big dreams, and live big! #1'2'

The error will likely be fixed with a patch soon, but in the meantime, players are having fun posting grabs and video of the tiny linebacker

Good sport: Even Kirksey himself sees the humor in the glitch

Actual size: The glitch occurs in Solo Mode of the newest edition of the wildly popular Madden football franchise. At right, St. Louis native Kirksey is seen at his actual 6-foot-2 height

Tiny Titan: Kirksey plays for the Cleveland Browns in real life, but the gamemakers chose for him to play for Tennessee, leading to jokes about the Tiny Titan
