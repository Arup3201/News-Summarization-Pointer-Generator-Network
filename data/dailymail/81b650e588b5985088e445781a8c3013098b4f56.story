A mother has told of her ‘nightmare’ after learning both her teenage identical twins had the same cancer.

Sally Hyde was devastated when her son, Harry Parnell, was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma just over a year ago.

Then last month, Harry’s twin, George, was also diagnosed with the disease.

Harry found a lump in his neck after being kicked while doing Taekwondo last August.

He went to hospital where he was eventually diagnosed with the cancer.

He has had gruelling chemotherapy treatment and his mother had to give up her job to look after him.

Mrs Hyde, a cleaner, said: ‘I went into complete shock when I found out his diagnosis.

‘He spent weeks in one room on machines at night for breathing and eventually after many scans he started chemotherapy.

‘Harry spent the next six months having treatment between Bristol and Exeter and that included radiotherapy all over Christmas.

Harry (left during chemotherapy) has now been told that his tumour is 'dormant' but he still has to have scans every three months. George (right) has just started treatment

‘He was extremely brave and even gave the lump in his neck a name, Keith.

‘What was so hard was not knowing the outcome. We had to joke about it or else we’d end up crying.’

She added: ‘While he was in hospital the doctors called him “the dude” as he was so chilled and relaxed about the treatment.

‘When he came out of hospital I wanted to put him in a bubble, but knew I couldn’t.’

The family were pleased to be told the tumour is now ‘dormant’ but Harry still has to undergo scans every three months.

‘I’m feeling fine now, but tired,’ said Harry.

However, just after Harry finished treatment, George also found a lump.

Mrs Hyde (pictured with Harry) said: 'He was extremely brave and even gave the lump in his neck a name, Keith. What was so hard was not knowing the outcome. We had to joke about it or else we'd end up crying'

Mrs Hyde said: ‘He came home and pulled his shirt down and I knew straight away it was the same.’

‘He was taken to hospital by his dad, Matthew. He’s had to have scans and a biopsy,’ said Mrs Hyde.

‘It’s still a massive shock, but I feel more prepared this time as I know what to expect.

‘I’ve cried but I have to carry on with life. I’m proud of my sons with how they cope.’

Hodgkin's lymphoma is cancer of the B lymphocytes - a type of white blood cell found in the lymphatic system.

Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes.

In lymphoma, these lymphocytes start to multiply abnormally and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes.

The most common symptom is a painless swelling in a gland, most commonly in the neck, armpit or groin.

The cancer is most common in 15 to 35-year-olds and the over 50s. More men than women are affected.

Nearly 1,500 people in the UK are diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma every year.

It is one of the most easily treatable forms of cancer - almost all young people with Hodgkin's lymphoma will be cured. For older people, the cure rate is about 80 per cent.
