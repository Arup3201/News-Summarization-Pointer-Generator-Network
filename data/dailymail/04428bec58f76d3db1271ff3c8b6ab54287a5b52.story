The huge wealth of Charles Saatchi and Nigella Lawson meant that paying £1million a year in credit card bills for their five personal assistants was considered too ‘trivial’ to worry about, a court heard yesterday.

Yet when an accountant investigated he found two of the assistants had spent £685,000 on themselves in only four years.

One of the pair spent more than £8,000 
on designer clothes in a single day, had flown to New York and back for 
almost £5,000, and stayed at the Ritz in Paris.

Nigella Lawson paid £1million a year in credit card bills 
for their five personal assistants, a court heard yesterday

But in a case laying bare the bitter break-up – and sensational cocaine addiction allegations – between £100million art collector Saatchi and his former wife, the jury were told it took years for the alleged massive fraud to emerge.

Personal family assistants Elisabetta Grillo, 41, known as Lisa, and her sister Francesca, 35, each deny a single charge of fraud at Isleworth Crown Court in West London.

The pair, who live together in central
London, are said to have spent wildly on restaurants, flights, and 
fashion, as well as taking out thousands in cash, on Coutts credit cards
given to them by the wealthy family.

Over four years up until June 2012 they allegedly spent a total of £685,000 on themselves.

But
Mr Saatchi, and the financial team running the former advertising 
guru’s modern art gallery and collection, and Miss Lawson – who has her 
own fortune of £20million – were so awash with cash it was only a chance
occurrence that uncovered the Italian sisters’ spending.

It
happened when the sisters ordered a taxi with a firm kept on account by
Mr Saatchi’s art company Conarco, and left it waiting for an age 
outside the family home.

Irritated by its beeping, 70-year-old Mr 
Saatchi made enquiries.

He was shocked to discover it had been waiting to take one of his personal assistants to a polo match in Berkshire.

Mr Saatchi’s finance director at 
Conarco, Rahul Gajjar, told the court that although he had noted 
Francesca Grillo’s credit card spending creeping up – with her monthly 
limit leaping from £25,000 to £100,000 – he had not yet thought to raise
the matter.

Only when the taxi issue arose did he 
investigate properly and tell Mr Saatchi that each month Francesca was 
spending on average £48,000 and Lisa £28,000.

Luxuy: Francesca spent £1,424 at Gansevoort 
Hotel in New York (left) in June last year, the court heard. She also 
used the credit card the same month to pay a £1,280 bill at the Ritz 
hotel in Paris on the day she bought a Chloe dress for £723, it is 
alleged

'Spending spree': Elisabetta spent thousands of 
pounds on designer clothes from Calvin Klein at Harrods (left) and 
Harvey Nichols (right), both in central London

Miss Lawson was typically spending 
£7,000, while three other assistants, Anzelle Wasserman, Alice Binks and
Zoe Wales, were on average spending £8,000, £6,000, and £3,000.

Those bills totalled £100,000 a month or £1.2million a year.

Mr Gajjar said of the massive credit 
card bills: ‘It was on the back burner. We were dealing with more 
serious corporate matters and Mr Saatchi and Miss Lawson normally didn’t
have time for what we thought was trivial matters.’

It was, the court was told by 
prosecutor Jane Carpenter, a tale of luxury goods and designer shops 
from a group of people living the type of ‘high life’ usually only seen 
‘portrayed in glossy magazines’.

Yet even as the scale of the sisters’ spending emerged, Mr Gajjar investigated in a surprisingly informal way.

Credit card spending: Charles Saatchi, 70, arrives at Isleworth Crown 
Court where he will give evidence against his two former PAs 
who are accused of spending £685,000

He told the court that he knew how 
close they were to the family – with Lisa having worked for Miss Lawson 
for 14 years, originally as a nanny, and Francesca for ten, at first as a
housemaid – and did not want to upset them.

So he met them in the kitchen of the 
large family home early last July to discuss their spending on the 
cards.

He said he ran through the bills for the Coutts cards they held 
in their own names, and detailed masses of expenditure which the women 
readily accepted had been for their personal benefit.

Mr Gajjar listed the sisters’ personal expenditure in June last year alone.

Francesca had spent more than £4,700 
on flights to New York, where she spent £1,850 at high-end fashion store
Miu Miu and more than £2,000 on hotels.

She also used the card to pay a £1,280
bill at the Ritz hotel in Paris on the same day that she bought a Chloe
dress for £723. On June 12 she spent £5,385 at Miu Miu London, and 
£2,650 at designer store Prada.

Departure: Charles Saatchi leaves the court yesterday after being 
discharged by the judge. He will now give evidence tomorrow

'Trivial': Mr Saatchi's accountant said he did not tell the millionaire about the credit card spending earlier because he considered it a 'trivial' matter

Lisa visited more high street shops 
and fewer high fashion boutiques than Francesca – with Zara and John 
Lewis among them – but still managed to rack up almost £5,000 personal 
expenditure in the month, including cash withdrawals on her card.

Among other luxury brands the women 
blew thousands at Dolce and Gabbana, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Vivienne 
Westwood and the Four Seasons hotel group.

But other personal assistants not 
charged with any offence also spent money – at Annabel’s nightclub, the 
Babington House country venue and on Christian Louboutin shoes.

Anthony Metzer, QC, defending Lisa, 
said of the Grillos: ‘They believed they were authorised to incur this 
personal expenditure.’

'Slavery': Finance director Rahul Gajjar told Isleworth Crown Court yesterday that Elisabetta Grillo, 41, complained that she was being treated worse than Filipino slaves during conversations with her about credit card spending

Mr Gajjar said that at first both 
women talked of wanting to move on – but their tone changed when he 
asked the pair to sign letters admitting defrauding Mr Saatchi and Miss 
Lawson, and promising to slowly pay it back while still working for 
them.

It was said that Francesca apparently 
turned against her employers through outrage that Miss Lawson had phoned
the elite London private members club Soho House and cancelled her 
membership.

And the Grillos were also said to be 
furious when one of the couple’s children said they had heard the 
sisters had bought a house with money they stole from the family. The 
Grillos deny buying any house with the cash.

Claims: TV cook Nigella Lawson is expected to give evidence to the court next Wednesday against her former employees

Thanks to supporters: As Saatchi was arriving at court today, Nigella tweeted a recipe on Twitter

Mr Metzer told the court that the 
Italian sisters worked long hours for ‘modest’ salaries – £25,000 for 
Lisa and £28,000 for her sister – and suggested it was common practice 
for assistants to be allowed to spend on themselves.

He has told the court he plans to 
claim Miss Lawson allowed them to spend like crazy in return for them 
keeping quiet about her prolific drug abuse.

The case continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
