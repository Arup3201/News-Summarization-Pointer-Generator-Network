Impostor: A Facebook picture of the Adelaide teenager shows him wearing a medical uniform including a stethoscope

A teenager has been audaciously impersonating a doctor at two hospitals in Australia in echoes of the Leonardo Di Caprio movie 'Catch Me If You Can.'

The 17-year-old was spotted on hospital wards at the Royal Adelaide Hospital in South Australia wearing a name badge and a stethoscope, and even reading patient notes.

There have also been numerous sightings of him on the grounds of Flinders Medical Centre in the city wearing scrubs, an identity lanyard and stethoscope.

He has also been seen in the city posing as a doctor and offering first aid to the general public but police are currently refusing to identify him because of his age.

Although it is not believed he has come into contact with any patients, police said they are anxious to speak to him.

The
state health department has now circulated a situation report to some 
hospital staff warning them about the 'bogus clinician,' who was 
expelled as a St Johns Ambulance volunteer earlier this year for 
inappropriate behaviour.

The memo said he had been spotted on wards at the Royal Adelaide on at least three occasions since October.

He was reported to be confident, versed 
in medical language and terminology and thus highly plausible unless 
pressed about his identity.

The memo notes that he
has 'not to date committed substantive offences, but should he make 
physical contact with a patient, posing as a clinician, this would 
constitute criminal assault'.

The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Authority first warned Flinders Medical Centre about his activity in late November and the information was subsequently circulated to nursing directors and security.

On
that same day a staff member reported seeing him walking away from the 
hospital, wearing scrubs, an FMC lanyard and a stethoscope.

The
following day two more reports of possible sightings were made, one 
passing the level two pain clinic and one at the main entrance passing 
admissions.

Security
staff have been ordered to apprehend the youth and escort him to the 
hospital's executive suite should he be sighted again.

Hospital security is liaising with AHPRA investigations and providing CCTV and statements where necessary.

Because the youth is under the age of 18, he has not been named for legal reasons.

Catch Me If You Can is a 2002 biographical crime film in which DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale, who, before his 19th birthday, successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars by posing as a pilot, a doctor, and a parish prosecutor.
