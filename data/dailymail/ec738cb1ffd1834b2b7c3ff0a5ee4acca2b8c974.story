A geese tsunami was the colourful description given by a Canadian cameraman after he filmed an extraordinary natural sight in Richmond, Canada.

Maikel Parets was filming thousands of birds who had landed on a baseball field to take a break just south of Vancouver in British Columbia during their annual migration.

The sea of geese was impressive enough, but then they took off - those at the back went first with the others following as if they had choreographed their departure to look like a giant wave.

Stirring: Some further geese join the group from overhead as the geese start to move before departure

Parets repeatedly says 'Oh my God' as the geese begin the next phase of their journey by speeding directly at him before spectacularly flying over his head, with every moment captured. 

While Parets marvelled at the sight, one woman at the end of his video is seen checking her hair for an unfortunate deposit from one of the birds.  

Mr Parets said: 'I was spared and not even one of their poop touched me but the lady at the end of the video was not that lucky.'

Varri Raffan, of the George C. Reifel Migratory Bird Sanctuary, told Global News he was not surprised to see the large gaggle of geese travelling together as they are known to 'stick together'.

Raffan said geese are very family oriented, particularly remaining in large groups for migration and feeding purposes.

He said the area where the geese landed could accommodate up to 70,000 geese.
