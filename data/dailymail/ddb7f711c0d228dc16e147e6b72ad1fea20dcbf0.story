A father has been charged with the murder of his newborn baby after allegedly using the infant as a weapon to attack his girlfriend.

Alexander Forba, 32, snatched the infant from her mother and gripped the three-day-old baby by the legs to beat his partner like a club, a court heard.

Prosecutors told Pretoria Prison Court in South Africa that Forba then threw the infant to the floor of their apartment and continued to attack the woman until witnesses intervened.

The Cameroon national is believed to have flown into a rage after questioning whether he was actually the father of the child, police said.

The woman and the baby - who had not yet been formally named - were taken to hospital.

The child was pronounced dead on arrival after the alleged attack on Sunday, prosecutor Sipho Letsoalo told the court. 

Forba, who faces charges of murder and assault, will be held in custody until he returns to court next week.
