UEFA are set to further infuriate Manchester City by announcing that Paris Saint-Germain will face only a £20million one-off fine for breaching Financial Fair Play regulations.

City are already upset with European football's governing body over proposals to fine them £49m, payable in three instalments, and impose sanctions that would cut their Champions League squad cut from 25 to 21.

It was thought that big-spending PSG would face a similar 'settlement' following an investigation into their finances - in particular a £167m sponsorship deal with Qatar Tourist Authority. 

However, Sportsmail can reveal that PSG, confirmed as French champions on Wednesday night, will face a significantly smaller fine.

The move will incense City's Abu Dhabi owners, who feel harshly treated after reducing their annual losses from £98m to £52m over the past two years.

City are 
believed to have until Friday to accept the settlement or appeal to a 
panel empowered to impose even harsher, non-negotiable sanctions, 
including possible Champions League exclusion.

It was unclear whether PSG would face similar Champions League squad 
cuts and imposition of a salary cap but coach Laurent Blanc admitted 
UEFA's action means his club 'won't be able to do everything it wants' 
in Europe next season.
