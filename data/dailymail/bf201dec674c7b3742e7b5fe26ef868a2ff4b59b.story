Everyone knows the name of Kermit's glamorous admirer. It's Miss Piggy.

But did you know her name was originally Miss Piggy Lee... and her character was actually based on 1940s' American jazz diva Peggy Lee?

When the porcine Muppet and her co-stars became more famous, the 'Lee' was dropped to avoid upsetting the 'Fever' singer.

This is one of 350 amazing revelations in a new book - The Godfather Was A Girl - by Eamon Evans, which claims to reveal the real-life inspirations for famous characters of book and screen.

Did you know Muppet legend Miss Piggy was originally called Miss Piggy Lee... and her character was actually based on 1940s American jazz diva Peggy Lee (right)?

Walter 'Wally' Saunders (right), the man who 
built Roald Dahl's writing shed, is said to have inspired the author's creation, 
the Big Friendly Giant - according to The Godfather Was A Girl author Eamon Evans

The title comes from the claim that Mario Puzo, author of The Godfather, used his mother as inspiration for the main character of the classic Mafia tale.

An Italian immigrant, she raised her 12 children by herself in a New York slum.

According to 34-year-old Evans, Puzo said his mother was a 'wonderful, handsome woman... but a fairly ruthless person', the Daily Telegraph reported today.

'Whenever the Godfather opened his mouth, in my mind I heard the voice of my mother,' he is said to have exclaimed.

And then there's the Big Friendly Giant - one of Roald Dahl's well-loved creations.

When the muse took hold, Dahl would retreat to his shed, which was built by a man called Walter 'Wally' Saunders, who had hands like a 'bunch of bananas', an 'enormous' nose and ears, 'spoke with a strange accent' and 'got his words wrong'.

A description of the BFG himself.

Evans claims that Wally, 'a huge, sweet-natured Norfolk builder with a long, pale, wrinkly face', was the inspiration for the character.

Evans claims Wizard Of Oz author, L Frank Baum, based the Wicked Witch of the West (played by Margaret Hamilton, left, in the 1939 film) on radical 19th century feminist Matilda Gage (right)

Did you know that Crocodile Dundee (played on screen by Paul Hogan, left) was said to be based on real-life buffalo hunter Rod Ansell?

Saunders died in 2004, aged 91. When 
Dahl set up home in Buckinghamshire in 1954, he carried out various 
building jobs on the author's estate.

His assertion was reinforced by Michael Brittin, 75, the nephew of Mr Saunders.

'He knew that Roald Dahl had written the book and based 
it on him and the characteristics of the two are very similar,' Mr Brittin told the newspaper.

'He was a well-built man and had pretty big hands. He had very broad shoulders and was very muscular and strong.'

He said his uncle could 
even bend pipework over his knee.

Mr Evans also has revelations about another British author.

Mr Toad from The Wind In The Willows, by Kenneth Grahame, is claimed to have been inspired by the author's son, Alistair

Mr Toad from Wind In The Willows, by Kenneth Grahame, is claimed to have been inspired by the author's son, Alistair.

Like his fictional counterpart, he is said to have been quite a reckless chap.

Apparently, Alistair liked kicking little girls and hurling himself in front of cars.

Mr Evans also claims that the Wizard Of Oz author, L Frank Baum, based the Wicked Witch of the West on a radical feminist of the time, Matilda Gage, who lived from 1826 to 1898.

And perhaps Baum was trying to make a point.. because she also happened to be his mother-in-law.

His book calls her a 'courageous pioneer of women's rights' 
but also a 'man-hating testicle eater'.

And how about Aussie Outback hero Crocodile Dundee...

Did you know he was based on real-life buffalo hunter Rod Ansell?

Eamon Evans's inspiration for writing the book in the first place? He had been looking for inspiration for a novel

Or that free-spirited 80s rebel Ferris Bueller was probably based on Edward McNally, a former senior counsel to George W Bush?

He grew up on the same Chicago street as Ferris creator John Hughes and went to the same high school.

And, like Ferris, it's said he didn't attend very often.

Evans also namechecks one of Britain's best-loved comedy series Fawlty Towers.

Basil Fawlty, the angry hotel owner created by John Cleese, was based 
on real-life guesthouse owner Donald Sinclair, who lived from 1909 to 
1981.

According to Evans, the Monty Python team observed the 'snobby, bonkers and bad-tempered' hotelier for themselves when they 
stayed at his Torquay establishment in 1970.

In a Mail Online article in 2005, Cleese described Mr Sinclair as 'the most wonderfully rude man I
have ever met'.

Mr Sinclair is said to have thrown Eric
Idle's suitcase out of the window 'in case it contained a bomb' and
complained about Terry Gilliam's table manners.

There was also Draper Daniels, a famous ad man in the 1950s - said to be the 
inspiration for Don Draper in the TV show Mad Men.

Like his fictional counterpart, he enjoyed a 'martini lunch', 
smoking and attracted 'women like flies to flypaper'.

And Evans's inspiration for writing the book in the first place?

He had been looking for inspiration for a novel.

The Godfather Was A Girl is published by Hardie Grant books and due out on 
Thursday.
