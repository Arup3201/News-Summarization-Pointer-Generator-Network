A major investigation has been launched after surgeons at an under-fire hospital removed the wrong part of a patient's lung.

The botched operation, which was conducted at Basildon Hospital in Essex, saw surgeons remove the bottom section of the female patient's lung despite needing to remove the top.

The serious error, known as 'wrong site surgery', has been blamed on a mistake in the patient's medical notes.

The female patient survived the procedure back in December last year 2012 but an investigation has been launched to get to the bottom of how the major blunder occurred.

A hospital source, who refused to be named, said: 'It appears the medical notes that came with the patient from Broomfield had been filled out incorrectly and showed the wrong area of lung to be operated on.

'Afterwards Broomfield said that was the wrong area. It appears the mistake was made at Broomfield, but the investigation will have to look at whether this should have been picked up at Basildon.'

Dr Steve Morgan, medical director at Basildon and Thurrock General Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'In December there was an incident of wrong site surgery. External reviews are taking place into that serious incident.

'No one has been suspended and the nature of the incident is rather complex.'

A spokesman for Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford, Essex, said: 'The Trust is aware of this incident and, in line with its internal safety and governance policies, a full investigation is being carried out.

'It will review its internal clinical procedures after this investigation.' 

In November, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) issued two warnings demanding immediate improvement at Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.

It followed an unannounced inspection prompted by a number of serious incidents involving the care of children at the trust.

The inspectors found out-of-date medication that should have been discarded after their previous visit.

Staff also told them that some children waited more than an hours to be seen, despite guidelines saying they should be seen within 15 minutes.

Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is one of five NHS trusts in England that experienced higher than expected death rates between 2010 and 2012.

Speaking about the figures, a spokeswoman for Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: 'The trust is working hard to improve its mortality ratio performance.

'While the figures relating to July 2010-June 2012 show the trust’s mortality rates as being higher than expected, the figures are still within expected limits for our demographic.'

She added that the trust reviews all hospital deaths 'to see if there are any deficiencies in care'.
