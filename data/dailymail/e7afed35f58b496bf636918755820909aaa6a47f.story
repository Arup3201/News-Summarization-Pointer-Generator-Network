A woman who moved into an upscale hotel in southeast Wisconsin nine years ago after her home went into foreclosure is being evicted after running up an unpaid bill of $29,000.

Jana Ganjian, 64, said she checked into the Racine Marriott in 2004 after a lupus-like disorder forced her out of her job and eventually her home.

Staff at the hotel, where rooms cost as 
much as $200 per night, have refused to explain how Ganjian was allowed 
to stay at the hotel for so long while accruing the massive debts. But they finally began eviction proceedings after she filed for bankruptcy in June and she must now leave by October 24.

Ganjian explained that after she lost her job, she had no choice but to move into the luxurious hotel as she has no family, no friends were able to take her in and she could not get a loan.

'If I could be working, this wouldn't have happened in the first place,' she toldÂ The Journal Times of Racine.

'I had no vision of staying for nine and a
half years,' she added to WISN. 'But with no 
family, no longer with a home, the hotel became home and the staff 
became family.'

She said that she was able to make some of the $89-per-day fees with her monthly disability benefits, which total at $783, but that she could not afford all of them.

She claimed that she had accrued so 
many reward points during her stay that she reached the platinum level, 
the highest category, and hoped that this would knock money of the total
bill.

But when she
tried to use points to pay for her stay, the hotel revoked her 
account - enforcing the small print, which says they reserve the right 
to reject any application of the points.

She filed for 
bankruptcy in August and the Marriott began its eviction proceedings.

Plan: Her lawyer, Joseph Seifert, said there is a possibility she could get subsidized housing

A Racine County judge granted the eviction on Friday after Ganjian and her attorney, Joseph Seifert, failed to show up in court.

As Ganjian has been at the hotelfor more 
than 30 days, she is not a 'transient' and landlord-tenant laws 
apply.

The hotel therefore had to go through eviction procedures and could not forcibly make her leave.

But hotel general manager Brian Wismar 
declined to discuss her case further, citing customer privacy, and calls
from MailOnline seeking comment were not returned.

Her attorney, Joseph Seifert, said there was a possibility she could get subsidized housing, which she qualifies for, but that the process could take weeks.
