The White House says President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama will attend a Tuesday memorial service in South Africa honoring Nelson Mandela.

The service will take place at a stadium in Johannesburg.

The Obamas will be accompanied on Air Force One by former President George W. Bush and wife Laura Bush. Former President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, along with former President Jimmy Carter, will also attend memorials for Mandela in South Africa.President George HW Bush is the only living U.S. president not scheduled to make the trip to South Africa -  most likely due to his health.

President Bush's spokesman Jim McGrath tweeted Friday: '41 and Mrs Bush cannot accept Pres Obama's kind invitation to attend Pres Mandela's funeral. They will be there in spirit.'

A state funeral for Mandela will take 
place December 15 in the anti-apartheid leader's hometown, capping off a
 10-day mourning period.

The
 U.S. presidents are just a few on a long list of international 
dignitaries who are expected to attend the memorial services.

Prime Minister David Cameron has announced that he will be attending the funeral and Prince Charles is expected to join him.

Several celebrities who had personal ties to the late great leader, such as Oprah Winfrey and U2 frontman Bono, are also expected to attend the service.

Desmond Tutu, a long-time friend of Mr Mandela and former archbishop of Cape Town, is the clear frontrunner for leading the service.

Former President Bill Clinton is also set to attend the state funeral and will be joined by Hilary Clinton

Mourners have gathered to dance and sing songs of freedom outside his home as the world celebrates the life of the adored statesman who brought peace and equality to his country and died last night aged 95.

He passed away at home in Johannesburg at 8.50pm Thursday and his body was moved to a military hospital in Pretoria Friday morning, where he is under armed guard.

South African president Jacob Zuma announced Friday afternoon that Mandela’s state funeral will be held in Qunu, the village where he grew up, and will cap 10 days of national mourning.

The first major event will be on December 10, where a memorial service will be held at the Johannesburg soccer stadium that hosted the 2010 World Cup final, and holds 94,000 people.

Between December 11 and December 13 his embalmed body will lie in state in a glass-fronted coffin at the Union Buildings in Pretoria , where he was inaugurated as president on May 10, 1994.

On day nine, plans have been made for a military aircraft to fly Mr Mandela to Mthatha, the main town in the South African province of Eastern Cape.

His casket will then be taken by the military on a gun carriage to Qunu, his home village.

Later ANC leaders, local chiefs and Mandela's family are expected to gather for a private night vigil.

On the final day, Mandela will finally be laid to rest in the grounds of his family home in Qunu, where thousands of people- including world leaders- will gather for the state funeral.

Preparations for funeral are expected to bring the country of 53 million to a virtual standstill.

The
 sheer number of dignitaries, including numerous heads of state, is sure
 to spell a logistical nightmare for the South African government, which
 will be tasked with providing air-tight security during the solemn 
event.

According to several
 sources involved in planning the state funeral, the 10-day occasion 
will combine both Western traditions and those of Mandela's native clan,
 the Thembu.

At some stage 
during days one to four, Thembu elders are expected to gather for a 
first ceremony called 'the closing of the eyes' either at his home or in
 the mortuary.

The public will have a chance to say goodbye to their beloved father figure during a memorial service at the Johannesburg soccer stadium (above) that hosted the 2010 World Cup

After the ceremony, it is believed his body will be embalmed at the mortuary, thought to be a military hospital in Pretoria.

No formal public events are expected to take place until day five, December 10, when mourners will have a chance to say goodbye to their beloved father figure during a service at the 94,000-capacity Johannesburg soccer stadium that hosted the 2010 World Cup.

It is not clear whether Mandela's casket will be taken there. 

On days six to eight, December 11 to 13, the anti-apartheid hero's body is earmarked to lie in state in a glass-topped coffin at the Union Buildings in Pretoria, where he was inaugurated as president on May 10, 1994.

On day nine, plans have been made for
 a military aircraft to fly Mr Mandela to Mthatha, the main town in the 
South African province of Eastern Cape.

His
 casket will then be taken by the military on a gun carriage to Qunu, 
his home village, where the former leader spent his childhood years.

To
 mark the formal passing of responsibility to his family, the South 
African flag that is expected to drape his coffin will be replaced by a 
traditional Xhosa blanket.

Later, ANC leaders, local chiefs and Mandela's family are expected to gather for a private night vigil.

On
 the final day, Mandela will finally be laid to rest in the grounds of 
his family home in Qunu, where thousands of people, including heads of 
state will gather for the state funeral.

Mr Mandela often spoke with great love of his first home where his family members, including his children who predeceased him, rest.

The family plot is located just a few 
yards from the home he shared with his mother as a child and the one 
which he built following his release from Victor Verster Prison.

He loved Qunu 'in the unconditional way a child loves his first home' and spent holidays and special occasions here.

The protocol for the funeral 
preparations was drawn up more than a year ago, around the time when Mr 
Mandela's health took a turn for the worse, and it may be altered in the
 coming days.

Mourners 
will be able to share their thoughts about Mandela’s passing in 
condolence books that will be made available in all foreign missions, 
the Nelson Mandela Foundation headquarters and other institutions, 
according to The Guardian, which has obtained a copy of the protocol. 

It
 has also been reported that the South African Government is in talks 
with the BBC team that filmed the Royal Wedding in 2011 to get help with
 the world wide broadcast of the funeral of a global icon.

Guests at the funeral will include Mr Obama, the first lady and their daughters. Bill and Hillary Clinton, who knew Mr Mandela well, are also expected to make an appearance.

The scale and significance of the planned funeral is already being compared to the 2005 service for Pope John Paul II, which was attended by 2million people, among them five kings and 70 presidents.

Days one to four (Today to December 9): According to sources involved in planning the state funeral, the 10-day occasion will combine both Western traditions and those of Mandela's native clan, the Thembu.
