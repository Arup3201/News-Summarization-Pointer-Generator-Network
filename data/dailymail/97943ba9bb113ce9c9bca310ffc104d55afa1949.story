Manchester United new boy Marcos Rojo will be in contention to makes his debut against Queens Park Rangers at Old Trafford on September 14 after being granted a work permit.

Rojo travelled to Lisbon on Thursday in order to finalise the paperwork surrounding his work permit.

His change of availability will come as a welcome boost to Louis van Gaal who has been short of defensive options during the first few games of the season.

Sportsmail revealed on August 30 that the actual issue surrounding his work permit was that embassy officials were looking into the details of an altercation Rojo allegedly had with a neighbour in Argentina.

The 24-year-old was never prosecuted over the incident, which took place in 2010, but was still theoretically being investigated after the case was reopened in May of this year.

Rojo does not have a criminal record but  Embassy officials had no choice but to check the exact details of the situation before processing the visa as the case remained on his file.

Van Gaal will be hoping Rojo can help bolster his side's defence after two draws and a defeat in Manchester United's first three Premier League games.

Rojo sealed a £16million move to Manchester United from Portuguese outfit Sporting Lisbon on August 20 but was unable to take part in a competitive game until he was awarded a work permit.

The left-sided centre back, who featured in Argentina's 4-2 win over Germany on Wednesday night, is expected to go straight into Manchester United's starting line-up to face QPR after the international break.
