Prince Harry was met with thousands of excited fans on the Sydney waterfront today as he started his first official tour of the country.

The Prince was his usual fun self, laughing and joking with the public as he moved among the surging crowd.

Scores of people shook hands and took photos of Harry - who is representing the Queen on his first official visit to the country.

Harry was also met with screams and shouts of 'give us a wave 
Harry' from many adoring female fans - indicating that  'Harrymania' has certainly arrived in in Sydney.

The Prince seemed to be much more popular than another high-profile Harry - Mr Styles from boy band One Direction, who is also in the country on tour.

Two Harry fans, Sinead Kirrane and Rebecca Thompson, had come to catch a glimpse of the Prince.

Miss Kirrane, 23, originally from Galloway, Ireland, said: 'He seems fun, I'm a big fan.

'We are excited to see him and maybe get a smile from him.' 

Asked which Harry she wanted to see more, Dubliner Miss Thompson, 24, said: '(Prince) Harry is a world icon. One Direction are big at the moment but they will come and go.'

Also among the crowd were naval 
trainee medics Ayesha Sweeney, 19, and Renee Simmons, 21, who live six 
hours' drive away at their base in Aubrey, New South Wales.

Ms Simmons described Harry as 'gorgeous', adding: 'I'm in love. He wears a uniform very well.'

Miss Sweeney added: 'It was good to get a royal visit today for the review, it adds that extra excitement to it.'

Meagan
Roberton, 50, who went to the street outside the base with her family, 
said: 'We didn't expect to see him today so it's an added bonus.

Fans: Crowds gather to catch a glimpse of the Prince, who is representing the Queen during his visit

All aboard: The Prince boards a small boat to cross the harbour for a reception at Kirribilli House, on the north side of the bay with the country's Prime Minister Tony Abbott

'He's gorgeous, we all love him in Australia. I remember when he was born.'

The fourth in line to the throne had earlier coasted past the Sydney Opera House on board the Australian navy's survey ship HMAS Leeuwin - one of dozens of warships from 17 nations on the sun-dappled harbor this weekend for the International Fleet Review.

The review, a parade of ships, commemorates the arrival of the original Royal Australian Navy fleet a century ago.

Following a 100-gun salute, Governor-General Quentin Bryce joined Harry on board the Leeuwin to officially review the ships.

The prince had changed from a crisp white army dress uniform to a gray suit and blue tie to meet the public.

From
The Rocks, he took a civilian boat across the harbor to Kirribilli 
House, Prime Minister Tony Abbott's official Sydney residence.

Harry posed for photographs with Abbott, his wife Margie, and two of their three daughters, Frances and Bridget, on the grounds of the historic mansion before again shaking hands with the public at a front gate.

The show saw more than 7 metric tons (7.7 tons) of fireworks used and was expected to draw 1.4 million spectators.

Harry is in Australia's largest city for just one day as part of a quick visit to the country.

The prince flies to the Western Australia capital, Perth, on Sunday morning for a brief visit before departing.

Australia's first navy fleet of seven cruisers and destroyers entered Sydney's harbor for the first time on Oct. 4, 1913.

About 40 warships, 16 tall ships and 8,000 sailors are participating in this weekend's celebrations.

The participating warships are from the U.S., China, Britain, Brunei, Micronesia, France, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, Spain, Thailand and Tonga.
