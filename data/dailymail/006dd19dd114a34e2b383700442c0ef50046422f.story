Exotic dancer: Bunga Bunga party girl Ruby the Heartstealer claims she was not a prostitute

In a tearful protest on the steps of an Italian court, Ruby the Heartstealer claimed she had never been a prostitute.

But, the exotic dancer at the centre of the Berlusconi 'bunga bunga' party scandal, doesn’t seem to have everyone convinced.

Her one-time comrades have rubbished her claims, labelling her a ‘whore’ who ‘did half of Milan in six months’.

Former Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi is on trial for sex with Ruby when she was just 17. While the age of consent is 14 in Italy, it is illegal to have sex with a prostitute who is under 18. Both deny sexual contact.

Ruby, real name Karima el Mahroug, broke her two year silence on Thursday to claim she had never had sex for money.

But two of her former associates watching on TV, immediately took to Twitter to castigate her for ‘ruining all our lives’.

In an extraordinarily venomous attack, TV showgirl Barbara Guerra labelled Ruby a ‘hypocrite’, who had had more lovers ‘than a porn star’.

Miss Guerra tweeted: ‘Fxxx off! She has had more men than there are Picasso paintings. She did half of Milan in six months.’

Another of the bunga bunga girls, Romanian escort Ioana Visan, said: ‘You can’t throw stones and then hide your hands behind your back. She ruined all our lives and that of the president [sic] just to get famous.’

Miss Guerra responded: ‘Why doesn’t she return home to whore herself out. Maybe she’s afraid of being lynched. What a shame. She brought it all on herself.’

In the course of her dramatic statement on Thursday, Ruby claimed that she had been abused by a stranger at church, an experience that prompted her emotional demonstration.

The former nightclub performer, who has since the scandal broke in 2011 had a baby daughter, Sofia, one, said she now wanted to clear her name, so her child ‘could be proud of her’.

But Miss Guerra ridiculed the remark tweeting: ‘She has become Catholic and went to church at Easter! At least have the respect not to go inside. Go back to Morocco you big whore.’

The two women seemed not to care who was party to their Twitter conversation, at one point retweeting a follower who asked: ‘Do you know that we are all reading all this? ‘

Both women gave evidence for the defence at the Ruby sex trial in 2011. Miss Visan revealed in court that she herself was paid almost  £2,000 a month by Berlusconi ‘towards her university studies’.

Each lived, at the time, in their own luxury apartment owned in Milan, courtesy of the billionaire media magnate.

The Ruby sex trial has continued for more than year, subject to interminable delays by Berlusconi’s defence lawyers.

The verdict was expected last month but proceedings are currently on hold pending a Supreme Court decision, after Berlusconi’s lawyers demanded the trial be moved to the town of Brescia.

His representatives argued that the Milan judges are politically prejudiced against the former premier.

The decision is expected as Berlusconi battles to secure a place for his centre right party in a new Italian government
