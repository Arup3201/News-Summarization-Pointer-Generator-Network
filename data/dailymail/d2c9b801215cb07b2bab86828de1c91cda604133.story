The wife of former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice has hit out at critics of her husband after he was given an indefinite ban from the NFL for punching her.

Footage of the incident, which happened in February, emerged this week leading to public outrage and the termination of Rice's Ravens contract.

But Janay Rice, who married the American football star a month after the violent attack in Atlantic City, expressed her pain at the media reaction, and sympathised with her husband.

Released: Baltimore Ravens tweeted on Monday that Ray Rice's contract has been terminated by the club

Rice wrote that she had been embarrassed and hurt by 'unwanted opinions from the public' as she and her husband were forced to 'relive a moment in our lives that we regret everyday'. 

'I woke up this morning feeling like I had a horrible nightmare, feeling like I'm mourning the death of my closest friend,' Rice posted on her Instagram account.

'But to have to accept the fact that it's reality is a nightmare in itself. No one knows the pain that the media & unwanted opinions from the public has caused my family.'

'To make us relive a moment in our lives that we regret everyday is a horrible thing. To take something away from the man I love that he has worked his ass off for all his life just to gain ratings is horrific. THIS IS OUR LIFE!'

Calm before the storm: The couple are seen arguing in the lift in Atlantic City

Shocking: Rice punches his then fiancee in the face with his left hand, knocking her out

Out cold: Palmer was dragged from the lift after it stopped and Rice was later arrested

'What don't you all get. If your intentions were to hurt us, embarrass us, make us feel alone, take all happiness away, you've succeeded on so many levels. Just know we will continue to grow & show the world what real love is!

Rice finished the message with the sign-off 'Ravensnation we love you!'

The video, which emerged on Monday, led to a media storm about the length of Rice's original ban.  

Baltimore Ravens tweeted on Monday that they have terminated the contract of Rice and shortly after NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced that a two-game ban in July had been upgraded to an indefinite suspension.
