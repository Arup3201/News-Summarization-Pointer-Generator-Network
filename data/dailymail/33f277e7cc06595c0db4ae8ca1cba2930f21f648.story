What you are about to read is not about the naivety of swapping shirts, the departure of a world class forward or injury problems.

Though Mario Balotelli, Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge are all themes impacting on Liverpool’s season, one issue dominates more than anything and simply must be addressed if the progress they had made is not going to be halted completely.

It is their porous defence. Whichever way Brendan Rodgers looks at it, he cannot fail to see that the numbers are casting his team in a bad light: one clean sheet in 18 games, none since August 31, 48 goals shipped in 34 matches in all competitions since New Year’s Day.

Real Madrid became the seventh team since the turn of the year to breach Liverpool’s rearguard three times in a match but, for all the wonderful attacking talent they have, the Champions League holders did not have to engage overdrive to do it.

When you have spent more than £60million on defenders and a goalkeeper since May 2013, without including wages, the results should be better, of that there can be no dispute. 

Here Sportsmail looks at the men in the firing line and their respective shortcomings.

SIMON MIGNOLET

The Belgian has increasingly looked like his confidence is in tatters. He may be a good shot-stopper but shouldn’t that be a prerequisite of any No 1 in the Premier League? 

Goalkeepers need to be big, domineering characters who command their area but every time a high ball is hoisted into Liverpool’s box, he looks vulnerable. Top keepers, according to Roy Keane, are worth '12 points a season'. Is Mignolet making that difference? In a word, no.

Simon Mignolet's confidence has been in tatters recently and he could not prevent this goal against QPR

Mignolet is a good shot-stopper but that should be a pre-requisite for a Premier League No 1 goalkeeper

GLEN JOHNSON

When he is in top form, Johnson is a fine player and makes a big difference to Liverpool’s team but he is not yet in top gear after an injury-enforced lay off. 

He gave Cristiano Ronaldo too much freedom last night and there must be a doubt on how long he will remain a fixture in the starting line-up. He is free to talk to clubs about signing a pre-contract deal in January and Javier Manquillo is pushing for a place.

MARTIN SKRTEL

He is the best defender at the club and was excellent last season but this year he has not reached similar heights. 

If you asked 100 people to pick Liverpool’s best back four, he would probably feature in 90 per cent of the selections but he is finding it difficult at the moment as the way the team are set up to play means the defence can be overexposed. Needs to exert his authority more at set pieces.

DEJAN LOVREN

If ever there was a conundrum, it surrounds Lovren. Ask his current team-mates and those he played with at Southampton and they will tell you he is an outstanding defender, one who will not let anything past. 

Rodgers labelled him the successor to Jamie Carragher and leader of Liverpool’s defence when he arrived for £20m in August but he has been culpable for a number of goals conceded and looks to be trying too hard. The jury is most certainly out.

ALBERTO MORENO

One outstanding performance apart at Tottenham, it has been a bumpy introduction for the young Spaniard to English football as he has tried to find his feet. 

Looks to have all the tools going forward – speed, skill and good use of the ball – but defenders, first and foremost, are there to prevent the opposition from scoring and he needs to recognise when he should stick and when it is right to twist.

AND THE REST

It is not just about that five.

MAMADOU SAKHO, for instance, is clearly not in favour and has not justified his £18m move from Paris Saint-Germain. Similarly, KOLO TOURE is nothing other than back-up.

JOSE ENRIQUE’S form has dipped and dipped ever since a bright first season. JAVIER MANQUILLO, to his credit, has been dependable, while it should be noted that JON FLANAGAN has been a big miss during his spell out injured. He is a proper defender.

Kolo Toure (left) and Mamadou Sakho have also failed to show they can be the permanent answer either

Jon Flanagan (right) has been injured this season and has proved to be a huge miss for Liverpool

BUT REMEMBER

While it is clear the individuals in Liverpool’s defence are perform poorly, the team as a whole are too open. Rodgers might want to play a fluent brand of football but even the most stylish sides have been built on rock-solid foundations, attacking as a team and defending as one. 

If Liverpool’s season is not going to lurch from one setback to another, Rodgers has to find the answers as a matter of urgency. Too much is at stake. 

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers must get his defence right before the season as a whole disintegrates
