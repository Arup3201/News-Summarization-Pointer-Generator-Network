Rio Ferdinand is fearing a Manchester United backlash when he takes on his former club on Sunday.

The 35-year-old defender and his QPR team will head to Old Trafford to take on Louis van Gaal's side, who are yet to win this season.

And Ferdinand thinks that big-name signings Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao will lift United and get their season rolling.

Ferdinand told the Sun: 'The timing could not have been worse for us. They (Di Maria and Falcao) are two world-class players. They will be raring to go and wanting to prove themselves to the United fans.

'I've played against Di Maria before and really liked him. He's a really good runner with the ball - quick and direct - and one of the hardest players to play against.

'United have not had the best of starts and I have to do a professional job. I'm sure there will be a few emotions on my part but I have to put those to one side.'
