Luis Suarez believes Steven Gerrard should remain at Liverpool for the rest of his career as the Anfield club is 'part of him'.

Gerrard, who made his Liverpool debut in 1998, has been linked with moves away from Merseyside throughout his career, but looks unlikely to leave during the latter stages of his career.

Suarez played alongside Gerrard for the best part of three years before making his big money move to Barcelona last summer and the Uruguayan hopes his former captain will stay where he is.

He said: 'It would be perfect for Steven and for the great Liverpool fans if he ended his career there - it isn't a relationship that should ever break up.

'I know Steven and he would never want to leave Liverpool. That club is part of him - and the only way he would ever leave Liverpool is if they didn't want him.'

The Barca new boy also revealed that Gerrard was one of the main reasons for putting off a move elsewhere in a decision which saw Suarez guide Liverpool to a second-placed finish in last season's Premier League.

Suarez added: 'He was the big reason that convinced me to stay at Liverpool for one more season - you hear the passion and love for the club in his voice.'
