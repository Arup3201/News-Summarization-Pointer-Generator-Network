Shane Long may have had to recover from fracturing his ribs lately but his vocal chords seem to be as good as ever.

The Irishman was filmed serenaded his Southampton team-mates with a brilliant rendition of Bob Marley's hit 'No woman, no cry'.

Long's team-mate Ryan Bertrand posted a video of the injured Saints striker on his Instagram account showcasing his impressive vocal range.

Long has been out of action since late January when he was forced off in the second half of Southampton's FA Cup fourth-round exit to Crystal Palace.

The Republic of Ireland forward collided with Palace defender Joel Ward during the 3-2 loss resulting in the injury.

The former Cork City player and his Southampton team-mates are currently in Switzerland for a mid-season team break.

Ronald Koeman's side have dropped off the pace in the race for the top four recently, and their Dutch boss has seen fit to organise a three-day football-free trip to the Swiss Alps.

Long tweeted from his hospital bed reassuring fans that he was on the road to recovery after the injury

With a weekend off after being knocked out of the FA Cup and having slipped to four points behind fourth-placed Manchester United, the Southampton players have an 11-day gap to chill out before next Saturday's league visit to leaders Chelsea.

The Dutch boss hopes his side can refocus and regain energy ahead of the final push in their last 10 league games of the season.

'It’s a big achievement what we have until now,' he said. 'There are still ten games and we know we will fight until the last second to keep the highest position in the table that is possible.'
