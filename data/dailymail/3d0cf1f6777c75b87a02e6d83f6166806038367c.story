Former United States child prodigy Freddy Adu will start a trial with AZ Alkmaar on Monday having been without a club since an unsuccessful spell with Brazilian side Bahia in 2013.

The 25-year-old attacker was a member of USA's 2008 Olympics team, but he has never fulfilled the potential that saw him burst on to the global scene when he signed for Major League Soccer side DC United at the age of 14 in 2004.

The Dutch club announced the trial on their website on Sunday, with a message saying they hoped the success of former AZ star and Adu's old USA Under-20 team-mate Jozy Altidore would inspire him to new heights.

Adu, the only player to score hat-tricks in the Under-17 World Championships and at an Under-20 World Cup, played with Altidore at youth level, and even set up both of his goals in a 2-1 win against Brazil at the Under-20 World Cup in 2007.

Despite his clear promise, Adu has never lived up to the hype that saw him labelled 'the next Pele', and though he has been capped 17 times for USA his club career has since him travel between continents in search of regular football.

In 2006 he moved to Real Salt Lake, before Portuguese giants Benfica signed him a year later. He dabbled in Ligue 1 after failing to hold down a first-team spot in Lisbon, joining Monaco on loan for the 2008/09 season.

The next season he was back in Portugal with Belenenses, before he moved to Greek side Aris in January 2010.

Thirteen months after that he joined Turkey's Caykur Rizespor, but that spell was short-lived and he returned to the US half a year later.

Adu finally appeared to be settled after spending two years at MLS side Philadelphia Union, only to suddenly join Bahia in April 2013.

He was released by Bahia in November and had trials with Blackpool in February and in June former US boss Bob Bradley offered him a chance at Norwegian side Stabaek.Â 

Adu failed to impress Bradley enough to secure a long-term deal, which has led to his latest trial, at Eredivisie's AZ Alkmaar.
