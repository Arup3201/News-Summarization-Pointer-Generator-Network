Millie Mackintosh may have made her name on catty reality show Made In Chelsea. But since leaving SW13 behind she has set her sights on world domination.

As well as working with Xbox Fitness, posing for numerous beauty brands and even reportedly landing a spot on Celebrity MasterChef, Millie has been quietly working on yet another project.

The 24-year-old Quality Street heir has just been unveiled as the new face of Claire's Accessories.

The wife of Professor Green looks fresh-faced in the new campaign imagery for the accessories giant.

Donning a white T-shirt, jeans and boho jewellery, Millie pulls off her new modelling gig with aplomb.

As well as acting as their accessories horse, the former make-up artist has picked her favourite products from the store to curate a 'Millie's make-up bag' edit, which will be landing in shops and online imminently.

It was also revealed today that she may well be taking part in the upcoming series of Celebrity Masterchef.

A source told the Daily Mirror:
 'Millie loves cooking and thinks the show is great, so it would be a 
perfect return to television for her. Sheâ€™d be a brilliant signing for 
the show.'

In addition to being a fitness 
fanatic, the confectionery heiress regularly posts snaps onto her 
Instagram page of the culinary creations she has whipped up for her 
rapper husband.

The make-up artist bowed out of Made 
In Chelsea last summer ahead of her September wedding to Hackney-based musician Professor Green - real name Stephen 
Manderson - declaring that the series 'wasn't making her happy' anymore.

He said at the time: 
'She's just had enough of it ... I'm happy with her to do anything that 
makes her happy, and it really wasn't making her happy.'

But
 Millie is said to have been inundated with television offers after her 
hiatus from the small screen, and is even said to have been approached 
about the possibility of launching a presenting career in the not too 
distant future.

A source added to the Daily Mirror: 
'Millie has been approached for a few different shows. Nothing has been 
signed yet, so there are a number of different possibilities on the 
table.

'There has been 
some talk of her getting her own show or even doing some presenting 
work, but it would have to be the right project.'

Just
 last month, Millie - who shot to fame on the first series of Made In 
Chelsea in May 2011 alongside the likes of Caggie Dunlop, Spencer 
Matthews and Ollie Locke - revealed she had a new television project 
underway.

She told MailOnline: 'I have a new TV project this year and I'm going to be expanding my product range.'

Last
 year's series of Celebrity Masterchef, fronted as ever by culinary 
experts John Torode and Gregg Wallace, featured the likes of boxer Joe 
Calzaghe, journalist Janet Street-Porter and former Sugababes singer 
Heidi Range.

Comedian Ade Edmondson was crowned champion after winning the BBC cookery competition.

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Millie Mackintosh for comment.
