Germany printed five million stamps commemorating their fourth World Cup title before the final on Sunday had even started.

The 60-cent stamps are due to go on sale this week after the first commemorative copies are offered to the players and staff.

If Germany had lost the final, the stamps, printed by Deutsche Post, would have had to be pulped.

The stamps were ordered by Germany's Finance Ministry, which holds 21 per cent of Deutsche Post's shares through the state-owned KfW bank.

'This year I dared to hope very early on that our team would take the title,' Finance Minister Wolfgang Scaeuble told AFP.

'It's wonderful that the team turned this dream into a reality. I hope that this stamp will remind many citizens of the immense joy the team has given us.'

Meanwhile, it was reported that a new German football shirt bearing the four stars for Germany's four World Cup wins sold out within hours of the team's triumph in Brazil.

Germany were crowned world champions on Sunday night and Adidas wasted no time in commemorating the achievement - by revealing a kit with four stars above the badge.

Adidas' website was already displaying a 'sold out' sign next to the new shirts on Monday morning.

Hundreds of thousands of Germans attended a victory celebration in Berlin on Tuesday as they welcomed home their World Cup winners at the Brandenburg Gate.

The players, in matching black T-shirts, lapped up the celebrations by playing up to the estimated 400,000 people packing the 'fan mile' in front of the Berlin landmark.

Fans began arriving overnight to secure good spots to welcome home coach Joachim Low's team and the trophy.

Mario Gotze, the scorer in the 1-0 win 
over Argentina in the final on Sunday, was greeted with deafening cheers
 by the sea of fans waving black, red and gold Germany flags.

Midfielder Toni Kroos led the crowd in a chant of 'Miro Klose' - a tribute to veteran striker Miroslav Klose, whose two goals took his World Cup tally to 16 and made him the tournament's all-time leading scorer.

When the players emerged on stage to take their accolades, the fans welcomed each of them with a chant of 'football god' - giving Bastian Schweinsteiger, Thomas Muller, Gotze and Klose the loudest cheers.

'We're just mega-proud of this achievement, after standing here in 2006 and 2008 as third and then as second - and now we've finally done it after this long journey, with this sensational team,' defender Per Mertesacker said.
