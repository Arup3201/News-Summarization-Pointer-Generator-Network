Authorities in New York City are trying to track down three violent robbers who held up an armored car in Queens on Friday.

In all, the thieves got away with more than $300,000 in cash.

According to city and federal authorities, the guard was leaving an HSBC bank near Woodside Avenue and Elmhurst about noon on Friday when one of the armed robbers stuck a handgun in his face.

The FBI released surveillance photos of the robbery that show the robber wearing all black and pointing a gun at the frightened guard's face.

Simultaneously, another of the thieves stood directly to the guard's side as the hooded thugs ordered the man to hand over the cash.

Another image released by authorities show the terrified guard holding up his hands as the thieves burst through the door of the bank.

Authorities say the men sprayed the guard with mace before grabbing the cash and fleeing on foot.

Witnesses told investigators that after the robbers fled on foot, they got into a dark-colored Ford Explorer. Witnesses describe the SUV as being dirty and missing a front license plate.

GardaWorld, the armored car company that owns the car that was robbed, is offering up to $50,000 as a reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for holding up the car.
