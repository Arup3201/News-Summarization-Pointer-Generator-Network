Manchester United midfielder Juan Mata is a Barcelona 2016 transfer target with the Catalan giants already planning for next year.

Luis Enrique’s side are currently serving a transfer ban handed out by FIFA for breaching rules on the acquisition of players aged under 18.

As a result Barcelona are not allowed to sign any players in 2015 but Mata, who is not a certain starter under Louis van Gaal at Manchester United, has been linked with a move to the Nou Camp by Spanish paper Mundo Deportivo.
