Fernando Alonso hailed a ‘great day’ as he returned to work at McLaren’s headquarters in Woking.

The Spaniard missed the opening race of the season in Australia after he suffered concussion following an unexplained 134mph crash while testing at the Circuit de Catalunya in Barcelona last month.

Alonso, who was hospitalised for three days following the incident, spent time in the McLaren simulator on Wednesday as he bids to prove he is ready to return for the next race in Malaysia a week on Sunday.

‘Great day today at MTC (McLaren Technology Centre),’ said Alonso on his Twitter account. ‘Lots of meetings and simulator work.’

Kevin Magnussen deputised for Alonso in Melbourne, but after he qualified last, the Dane then failed to start the race as his Honda engine blew-up en route to the grid.

Jenson Button managed to get his McLaren to the end of the grand prix, but finished last and two laps behind race winner Lewis Hamilton.

It marked a miserable start to the renewed  partnership between McLaren and Honda, and many observers in the Albert Park paddock joked that Alonso may not have been too unhappy to have been absent. 

Alonso, the double world champion, must be cleared by the FIA’s doctors before he can get in the car again. A date for those tests has yet to be set, though they could take place in the Sepang paddock next Thursday. 

Meanwhile, Williams driver Valtteri Bottas is working with a leading physiotherapist in Indonesia as he bids to recover from a back injury which saw him miss Sunday’s race in Melbourne.

A William spokesperson said: 'We are doing everything we can to help the process of getting him back to full fitness.'
