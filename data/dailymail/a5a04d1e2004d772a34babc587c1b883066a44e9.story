Britons lacking motivation for that overdue health kick might find themselves hitting the gym after - rather than before - their summer holiday.

More than half of dieters are spurred on to embark on a weight loss mission after witnessing less than flattering holiday snaps, a new study finds.

In fact, the holiday photo album has been named the number one motivation behind UK weight loss ahead of a relationship break-up and being unable to fit into clothes.

Comments from a partner were the second 
most common form of motivation, with unflattering photos from nights out
 coming in third.

Interestingly, those spurred on to diet after seeing their bikini snaps actually lost more weight than those motivated by any other reason.

More than 2,100 British people took part in the online survey, all of whom were aged 18 and over and on a diet at the time of the poll.

Initially, respondents were asked 'What first motivated you to lose weight?' and provided with a list of answers, with the opportunity to select as many answers as were relevant to their decision to embark on their diet.

The survey
 then asked respondents how much weight they had lost, on average, per 
month during their diet, finding that an average dieting Briton loses around 
3lbs per month.

1.       Unflattering holiday photos – 51 per cent

2.       Comments from partner – 46 per cent

3.       Unflattering photos from nights out – 43 per cent

4.       Being unable to fit into clothes – 41 per cent

5.       A relationship break up – 38 per cent

6.       Comments from general public – 32 per cent

7.       Comments from friends & family – 29 per cent

8.       Worried about embarrassing children / family – 24 per cent

9.       Recommendation by doctor – 17 per cent

10.   Realising you're unable to see certain body parts when naked – 15 per cent

A spokesperson for online pharmacy specialising in weight loss treatments, UKMedix.com, who commissioned the survey, said: 'I think most of us have seen pictures of ourselves at one point or another and cringed, perhaps at an outfit, a hairstyle or, possibly worst of all, a few extra pounds we'd gained without realising it.

'When you're on holiday, you're likely to be pictured in skimpier clothing and swimwear, so there's no escaping any extra weight. Although it's not nice to see initially and can come as a bit of a shock, eventually the dieter will be grateful for the inspiration.'
