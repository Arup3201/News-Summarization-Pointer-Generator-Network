Search through the thousands of pages written about Louis van Gaal over the years and you won't find much about the value of running and jumping. Manchester United's manager has always preferred to talk about rather sophisticated facets of the game.

As he reflects on perhaps the first significant result of his time at Old Trafford, though, Van Gaal and his sports science team will have noticed the remarkable numbers attached to Marouane Fellaini's stand-out performance against Chelsea on Sunday.

Fellaini is never going to be invisible. Not when he looks like he does. Nevertheless anyone who left Old Trafford on Sunday sensing that the big Belgian had been 'everywhere' will be interested to know that he pretty much was.

Marouane Fellaini put in one of his best performances for Manchester United against Chelsea

The Belgian midfielder was signed by former manager David Moyes for £27.5million last summer

According to the statistics, Fellaini covered 12.17km during the course of the game, almost a kilometre more than United's Daley Blind, the man next in the list.

More significantly, Fellaini also completed 70 sprints, a remarkable number for a holding midfield player and more than two United full backs encouraged by their coach to overlap.

Numbers can be over-used and over-analysed in football. Some may say that the only statistic that really matters from Sunday's engrossing clash was the 1-1 scoreline.

Nevertheless, Fellaini's efforts say everything for his return to physical fitness after a difficult first year at United and go some way to indicate just why Chelsea's primary playmaker had such a relatively minimal impact on this game.

Clearly designated to shadow Cesc Fabregas, Fellaini ensured that the Spain midfielder made only three passes in the first 20 minutes and eleven in the whole of the first half. Prior to the game, Fabregas was the most successful and regular passer of a football in the Barclays Premier League.

'He was fantastic,' said Robin van Persie of Fellaini.

'He did a great job on Fabregas for us.

'It was incredibly helpful when you are trying to stay in a game.' Fellaini endured an awful first season at United.

David Moyes' big summer signing of 2013, unfortunately for him he became rather synonymous with the former United manager's difficult time at Old Trafford. In the summer, Van Gaal suggested to the club's executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward that Fellaini be sold.

'He is not a United type of player,' Van Gaal told Woodward.

Had injury not intervened, Fellaini would probably be playing his football on loan at Napoli right now. He may never have been seen again in a United shirt.

With some belated and overdue fitness, however, has arrived something of the player we used to see at Everton.

Fellaini was always technically good enough but it was the energy and physicality of his football that stood out during his time on Merseyside, as well as his habit of scoring important goals.

Last season at Old Trafford the Belgian looked desperately short of confidence. It must be said, he rarely looked of the required standard.

Moyes perhaps didn't help by talking of the 'best chest trap I have ever seen' - faint praise, that - but with hindsight maybe it was the debilitating effect of a succession of injuries that prevented Fellaini from reaching the levels of fitness required to play his natural game.

After the draw at West Brom, Van Gaal conceded that he may have to adapt his own philosophy a little as he continues to learn about English football.

'We have to look also for physical talents and maybe that's our problem,' said Van Gaal in explaining his decision to leave out Ander Herrera.

'I'm a coach who is always thinking about creative players but in England you also need physical bodies in your team and Fellaini is one of these.' 

Fellaini is perhaps slightly more than that but the fact is he may not have played on Sunday had others been available yet the way that United conceded a goal to Chelsea from a set-piece showed just how valuable the 26-year-old may prove to be.

United are not a particularly tall side, especially when players like Michael Carrick and Darren Fletcher are not in it. If you look at the physical attributes of Chelsea and Manchester City, for example, that certainly becomes clear.

Louis van Gaal has conceded he may need to change his methods as manager of Manchester United 

Fellaini brings muscle and aerial threat at both ends of the field. Van Persie may have scored the equaliser  but it was Fellaini's header from a set-piece that served as the vital assist.

Former United captain Gary Neville said: 'For 25 years, Manchester United as an option, not as a rule, would lump the ball forward. There's no doubt.

'People say it's not the Manchester United way, but I don't get that.

'So Fellaini could come in handy. Carrick is 6ft 1in and there might be an option there.

'You've got to think about those things going into a game and I'm sure Louis van Gaal will this season.'
