The mother of a young man who was brutally bashed while holidaying on one of Thailand's most popular islands has revealed her heartache over the fact her son could now face time behind bars.

In June of this year Australian-born Jack Hansen-Bartel, 20, who has lived in Bangkok for the past 15 years, took a trip to Koh Samui to celebrate his high school graduation.

While partying at popular nightspot Green Mango, Jack was beaten so severely he sustained irreversible disfiguration to his jaw and mouth.

His family said it was a completely unprovoked attack which has put the 20-year-old's modelling career in jeopardy, and prevented him from returning home to Melbourne to begin his university degree.

Jack's two alleged attackers Raymond Tony Chang and Ryan Yunshang Wang - both 19-year-old international students from the Shanghai American school - had just completed their studies at the Shanghai American School.

They pair were arrested just days after the attack, and charged by the police with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. 

But the Hansen-Bartel family said there had been suspicious behaviour during the course of the case, and the accused pair were returned their passports and allowed to travel freely to and from Thailand as proceedings continue.

Jack's mother Annie Hansen said the legal system in Samui is making life extremely difficult for her family, despite having a great deal of help from officials in Bangkok, and her son is the victim not the perpetrator.

'Jack was lucky to live through the ordeal', Ms Hansen revealed to Daily Mail Australia.

'At the end of the day, Jack's now facing three charges, possibly a permanent criminal record, and maybe time in a Thai jail', she continued.

'We're living through this every day, Jack and I, either we're sitting here just crying our eyes out holding each other or we're working on the case.'

The Hansen-Bartel family have been struggling to get justice on Koh Samui, but have had a lot of assistance from army and government officials in Bangkok, seen here with Jack

Jack has already undergone a number of surgeries with many more to go, and even then will never fully recover physically

Jack is trapped recovering in Bangkok, having undergone some of a potential dozen surgeries he will need to reconstruct his mouth over the next couple of years. He has been told by doctors he will never make a full physical recovery.

Six weeks after he was viciously attacked, counter charges were filed against Jack. 

These charges accused the young man of instigating the altercation, but Jack's mother Annie Hansen believes there is something more sinister at play behind the scenes.

However, police have admitted there is no evidence to back up these counter-claims, and the Forensic Institute of Thailand have also been involved in the case and believe a blunt weapon was also involved in the attack.

In a victim impact statement he sent to Chang and Wang's future colleges in the United States, Jack outlined the severe and brutal nature of the alleged attack by the pair.

'I had no ability to defend myself as I was hit with a cowards punch, as I did not see the punches coming, I was completely oblivious to the situation. 

'To add further injury and to send some kind of message, one of them dealt the final blow when I was on the ground about to black out, causing me to lose total consciousness,' he wrote.

'When I regained some consciousness after this horrific attack, I found myself bleeding profusely from my right eye and mouth area missing teeth bone and gum tissue.'

Jack also wrote about the impact the assault would have on the rest of his life. 

'I intended to move back to Australia to embark on a new chapter of my life and reconnect with family ...

'Both attackers have been charged by the police with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. They have also been hit with a private criminal lawsuit.  

'My family and I spend every day trying to fight... when all I want to do is be given time to rest and hopefully heal. It is time someone takes a stance against violence.'

Ms Hansen revealed Purdue University launched a full disciplinary inquiry into the case, and requested the above impact statement. They have suspended Ryan Yunshang Wang for a year.

Cornell University where Raymond Tony Chang is set to attend responded to the documents saying as the incident occurred before he had commenced classes at the establishment, they would not suspend him. 

Ms Hansen revealed the struggle to get justice for her son, saying Jack would go to prison rather than admitting guilt to something he didn't do

On the account of Jack's brother Jesse Hansen-Bartel, the night his sibling was beaten Jack headed out to a club called Green Mango with a girl he had met earlier in the day.

Jesse, 24, and some of their friends were also at the establishment.

When Jack arrived at the club, he was approached by two men who claimed the girl was with them. 

Jesse told Daily Mail Australia CCTV footage from the evening shows his brother walking away without any trouble.

Later in the evening Jack was blindsided by two attackers and the bashing left him missing three teeth from his disfigured jaw, with blood spilling from his mouth and face.

Ms Hansen said there has been suspicious and questionable circumstances surrounding her son's case.

Jack's mother said she witnessed the public prosecutor in a meeting with the families of the two accused, which an army official told her was a 'highly irregular' occurrence.

'We're not playing that game, the charges against Jack don't exist', Ms Hansen said.

'Jack has said he will go to prison than plead guilty to something did not do.'

'(And now) it looks like he could be faced with a choice between his freedom or potentially a Thai prison', she said.

The case of murdered British travellers Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, on nearby Koh Tao last month is another where locals say suspicious activity has taken place.

Ms Hansen said her story is apparently just the 'tip of the iceberg' when it comes to the treatment of such cases.
