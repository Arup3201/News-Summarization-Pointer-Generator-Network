The peer said he couldn't get excited by the current leaders or the visions they have

The peer who bankrolled Labour through the Blair and Brown years has condemned Ed Miliband as an ‘average’ politician with an uninspiring political vision.

Lord Sainsbury of Turville, who has given more than £12 million to the Labour Party, says that he has no intention of donating to the party again.

The multimillionaire businessman and philanthropist said of the labour leader: ‘In terms of political skills, I think he’s average. Average in the sense that I think Nick Clegg and David Cameron are pretty average.

‘None of the three leaders was in the “top bracket”, and did not compare with Tony Blair or Margaret Thatcher,’ he told the Times.

But the peer, part of the Sainsbury’s supermarket dynasty, denied that he had stopped funding Labour because David Miliband - who he had backed in the Labour leadership race in 2010 - was defeated by his brother.

The comments come before the release of Lord Sainsbury’s new book, in which he makes the assertion that the economic policies of the Blair and Brown governments, in which he played a role, were flawed.

In his book, Progressive Capitalism, he writes: ‘I believed the policies we [Labour] had developed in opposition would increase the prosperity of the country and create a fairer society.

‘But in government, I gradually came to realise that our thinking largely reflected the dominant neoliberal political economy of the time, which was not a useful basis for developing policies to achieve our goals.’

He continues:  ‘In retrospect the Labour government should have used the opportunity of a strongly growing economy to reduce the deficit.’

The peer said he couldn’t get excited by the current leaders or the visions they have and that he could not suggest an alternative leader to Ed Miliband, because he ‘wouldn’t want to blight their careers by singling them out’.

He said he has become less political following beginning his work with the Institute for Government, the charity he set up to improve Civil Service effectiveness, and as Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, a role he assumed in 2011.

‘It’s much easier to do them if you’re not heavily involved in politics,’ he said.

However, he insisted his has not become ‘apolitical’ and is still a member of the Labour Party. He continues to talk to them on ‘issues on policy and progressive capitalism. But I put that in a very different category from major contributions to the party,’ he said.

And Lord Sainsbury denied that he withdrew funding from the Labour Party because Ed Miliband won the 2010 leadership contest.

Although he made his last direct donation to Labour in April 2010, the peer has continued to fund Progress, a Blairite think-tank, and Movement for Change, which trains Labour activists in the UK.

He has donated £1.3 million since May 2010, according to Electoral Commission records.

Last summer, the GMB union called on Ed Miliband to outlaw Progress. ‘They made these various speeches but no one paid any attention to it, as far as I know,’ Lord Sainsbury said. ‘I guess it’s to do with the idea that Progress is a Blairite organisation which the trade unions should oppose.’

Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said: 'This is further proof that a weak Ed Miliband is allowing Labour to be taken over and run by unions in their interest, rather than in the interests of the hardworking British people.

'It's no surprise that Ed Miliband's totally opposed to dealing with the deficit, fixing welfare or getting immigration under control when 81 per cent of his funding comes from union bosses.

'All Ed Miliband offers is the same old Labour solution that got us into this mess in the first place - more spending, more borrowing and more debt.'
