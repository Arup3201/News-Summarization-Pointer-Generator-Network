Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., the Chicago lawmaker who took medical leave from Congress in June and has receiving treatment for bipolar disorder, last night coasted to easy re-election.

However, his only campaigning has been by automated phone calls to voters.

His celebration location, too, is a bit unorthodox – rather than revel in an upscale hotel room, Jackson Jr. remains in the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.

Easy win: Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr.has won re-election to his Chicago-area congressional seat while on a months-long medical leave

Mum's the word: The Rev. Jesse Jackson, pictured last month, has been tight-lipped about his son's condition

Jackson, 47, has served in the House of Representatives since 1995, and beat out Republican Brian Woodworth and Independent Marcus Lewis.

Jackson Jr.’s win was generally expected, though the son of the Civil Rights activist hasn’t been seen in public in months while he’s being treated for bipolar disorder.

In his robo-call, which was sent out last month, Jackson Jr. said that the recent events in his life were ‘difficult to sort through.’

‘I am human,’ the representative said in the automated call. ‘I am doing my best. I am trying to sort through (all of my problems.)’

Competition: Republican Brian Woodworth lost the seat for the 2nd Congressional District

He has been compared to another absentee Chicago politician, John Stroger, who also won a primary without actively campaigning.

Jackson Jr., who is the son of civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, left Congress with a vague statement this summer.

'Recently, we have been made aware that he has grappled with certain physical and emotional ailments privately for a long period of time,' said Jackson's staff in the statement.

'At present, he is undergoing further evaluation and treatment at an in-patient medical facility.

'According to the preliminary diagnosis from his doctors, Congressman Jackson will need to receive extended in-patient treatment as well as continuing medical treatment thereafter.'

Senator Durbin compared Jackson's disappearance to the marked contrast with the Republican Senator for Illinois, Mark Kirk, who kept the public updated following his stroke in late January.

'I thought Senator Kirk’s video talking about his rehabilitation answered hundreds of questions that I was facing, and I think to the satisfaction of Illinois voters told them what his current situation is and what his hopes are about recovering,' said Durbin.

Others questioned A profile appearing last month in the Washington Post about the reclusive lawmaker revealed a more erratic side of Jackson Jr.

Political operative Frank Coconate speculated that Jackson Jr. ‘had a problem with reality,’ adding that the Chicagoan enjoyed hanging out at Turkish baths ‘prancing around in the nude.’

He also boasted that he was a reincarnated Chariot driver, sources told the Post.

Since Jackson disappeared from public life, speculation has increased as to the possible reasons.

The congressman has endured trying times over the past several years.

A
House Ethics Committee also is investigating allegations that Jackson 
was involved in discussions about raising money for former Illinois Gov.
Rod Blagojevich's campaign in exchange for Blagojevich appointing him 
to President Obama's vacated U.S. Senate seat.

Blagojevich is serving a 14-year prison sentence for corruption.
