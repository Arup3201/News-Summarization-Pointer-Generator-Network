VIDEO Holders Real drawn with Liverpool

Real Madrid

Liverpool's Head-to-head: P 3 W 3 L 0 D 0

Star man: Cristiano Ronaldo

Manager: Carlo Ancelotti

Stadium: Santiago Bernabeu

European pedigree: The biggest name in European football, bar none. 

10 times European Champions, current Champions League holders, and the most expensive squad ever assembled in world football. 

They don't come any bigger.

Did you know: Real Madrid are hoping to become the first team to defend the Champions League since the tournament took on its current format in 1992.

Basle

Liverpool's Head-to-head:  P 2 W 0 L 0 D 2

Star man: Marco Streller

Manager: Paolo Sousa

Stadium: St Jakob-Park

European pedigree: Last season Basel beat Chelsea at home and away, but still contrived to fall at the Group stage. 

Two years earlier they reached the last sixteen, knocking out Manchester United on the way, so they have an excellent track record against English sides, even if they cannot be considered a European giant on the scale of Liverpool or Real Madrid.

Did you know: Basle qualified for the Champions League last season by beating Group X opponents Ludogorets in the play-off

Ludogorets

Liverpool's Head-to-head: P 0 W 0 L 0 D 0

Star man: Cosmin Moti

Manager: Georgi Dermendzhiev

Stadium: Ludogorets Arena

European pedigree: Liverpool and Real Madrid have 15 European Cups between them. Ludogorets are making their debut in the competition. 

The opposite ends of the scale, but the Bulgarians have shown in qualifying they care little for reputation.

Did you know: Defender Cosmin Moti was forced to play in goal during the Champions League qualification play-off. He saved two penalties and scored his own to send his team through
