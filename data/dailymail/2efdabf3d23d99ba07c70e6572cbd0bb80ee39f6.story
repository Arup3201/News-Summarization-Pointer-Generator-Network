A Ugandan pop star faces arrest after her ex-boyfriend posted naked ‘revenge porn’ photographs of her on the internet.

Desire Luzinda has gone into hiding after the pictures went viral on social media websites and were published in newspapers in the East African country.

But the nation’s State Minister for Ethics and Integrity Simon Lokodo has said that the 26-year-old musician should be investigated or even arrested amid a tightening of restrictions over pornography.

The singer, who has a young daughter, told the BBC: ‘I was in love. I have never taken nude pictures. When my mother called me she asked, “Were you drugged, were you drunk? Because honestly, this isn’t you.” I didn’t have an answer.’

It has been claimed that the photographs were leaked after a row between Ms Luzinda and her former lover.

But Lokodo told the Monitor: ‘I have directed the police to arrest her, but first they should investigate her.

‘She should be locked up and isolated.’

According to The Week, a more conciliatory tone was struck by ethics ministry official Patricia Okiria who suggested the singer would simply be 'contacted to help in the investigations' over the leaked photographs and might not be charged.

Local media outlets are well known for exposing 'immoral' sexual behaviour among high profile public figures, the website says.

Ms Luzinda, who lives in Kampala, Uganda, has since thanked fans who have supported her while apologising for any offence caused by the publication of the pictures, the Independent reports.

‘I want to sincerely apologise to my mother, to my daughter, to my family, to my friends, my fans and any other people who have been offended by these images,’ the newspaper quotes her as writing.

‘Like I said, this was a breach of trust by someone I loved. I take full responsibility for having lost my mind to take such shameful pics. This person has not only abused that trust but now seeks to drag me down.

‘Those who have interacted closely with me know I am a decent person, a doting mother and an industrious woman. These images in no way should define who I am.’
