Per Mertesacker has told Arsenal's shellshocked players to raise their game after the disastrous defensive performance against Anderlecht.

Arsenal were leading their Group D clash 3-0 against the Belgian champions with half an hour left to play when they came back to draw 3-3 at the Emirates.

Mertesacker is refusing to take responsibility for yet another inept defensive display and insists the team must work together to prevent teams taking advantage of their fragile confidence.

The Arsenal defender, now preparing for Sunday's trip to the Liberty Stadium to play Swansea, said: 'We will bounce back quickly and we are really good at that and have shown that a couple of times.

'It was a good warning and everyone should raise their game and give 10 per cent more when it is really needed.

'Anyway we have to defend better as a team. Even when we drop they always look dangerous. We need to be more aware of that. Everyone in the team has to be involved to defend.

'We cannot afford that we have just five or six players defending and just the back four. That's what we lacked especially in the final third in the last 20 minutes.

'It will be a tough game at Swansea. It will be totally different we cannot compare any game to one another.'

Although Arsenal only need one more point to ensure progress to the Champions League second round, their defence was brutally exposed by Anderlecht's stirring comeback.

Despite the team's disastrous defending, Arsenal had kept clean sheets in their previous two games — against Sunderland and Burnley — before the spectacular Champions League collapse.

Mertesacker added: 'There is nothing to explain about that. I think everyone knows what happened actually. Everyone saw it, there is nothing to explain particularly. The team is very disappointed and it is a small setback for us. But we are good at bouncing back very quickly after small setbacks. This is a small one, it's a good warning I think.'
