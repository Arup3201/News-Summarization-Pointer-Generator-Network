It was a second set visit for the Queen in two days after she met Antiques Roadshow experts, 24 hours after touring the Game of Thrones set in Belfast.

While she refused to take a seat on the HBO drama's infamous Iron Throne, today the Queen was all smiles, eagerly picking up a minature bronze horse taken from the Royal Collection.

She even confessed to watching the show, with the Duke of Edinburgh quizzing producers and presenter Fiona Bruce about when the episode starring them would air.

The Queen turned from signing the visitors' book to add: 'If it is in 
August then even better because we might have a chance to see it.'

Among the pieces to find favour with the monarch was a small, bronze sculpture of a horse and jockey, believed to be of the 1863 Derby winner Macaroni.

The history of the work by French artist Pierre Jules Mene, and the race, stirred interest after the experts revealed the Epsom winner took home the spoils after 32 false starts.

'It seems very incompetent doesn’t it,' commented the Queen, a racehorse owner who has had runners in the Derby herself. 'But quite interesting.'

Just the thing! The Queen appeared more enamoured with the Antiques Roadshow than Game of Thrones

With its 
gentle experts and enthusiasm for all things historical, Antiques 
Roadshow is far more in keeping with the Queen's personal taste than Game 
of Thrones, although Buckingham Palace refused to confirm which of the 
shows Her Majesty watches.

The HBO 
drama, which emerged from a set of fantasy novels by George R. R Martin,
 is thought to be loosely based on the Wars of the Roses, which saw two 
opposing dynasties battle it out for the throne of England.

With York on one side and Lancaster on 
the other, England was convulsed by a series of battles, dastardly plots
 and pretenders lurking on the other side of the Channel until, with the
 death of Richard III, Lancaster finally triumphed.

Although the Queen is a descendant of the House of Lancaster - and is the current holder of both title and duchy - she appeared far more engaged when discussing antiques with the BBC One experts.

Along with Macaroni's bronze, the royal couple were also shown a George IV library table, which is one of a pair kept at Hillsborough, an 18th century Chinese soup tureen and five figurines from a Meissen monkey orchestra - both of which are held in the National Museum of Northern Ireland.

One of the more interesting pieces was a Wagga Wagga stick which was gifted to the Queen on her tour of Australia in 1954, although there was no explanation for how the Aboriginal fighting club ended up in Hillsborough.

Prince 
Philip was particularly interested in the club but couldn't resist a 
joke questioning the evidence linking the item to the royal collection.

'Where’s the evidence?' he quipped. 'The
 story between then and now is mysterious,' riposted Antiques Roadshow's bric-à-brac expert, Paul Atterbury.

'I think that’s like a lot of 
things that arrive here in the palace without any clear knowledge of how
 or why. All the things here (on the table) are in the house for one 
reason or another without the back story.'

Take your fancy? The Queen was particularly keen on a silver christening cup that has a strong connection to the Royal Family

Mr Atterbury and fellow experts John Axford, a ceramics and Far East specialist, and Hilary Kay introduced the items and spent 10 minutes with the royals.

Among the items shown by Ms Kay to the Queen was a christening cup that has a strong connection to the royal family.

'What was lovely about this is, this is a piece unlike the other objects as it has a direct family connection,' she said.

'She
 loved the silver and she was very interested in the stories behind the 
items - they were both interested in everything on the table.'

The 
cup was gifted to the daughter of the chief engineer on a transatlantic 
liner after she was born while Lord Granville, Governor of Northern 
Ireland, and his wife, were travelling on the ship to America.

On hearing the news Lady Granville, the Queen’s aunt, said she would send a gift for the new arrival, Rose.

The
 Queen was told how the young woman gifted the silver cup back to the 
royal family, along with two 
family photographs, to add to their collections.

Afterwards, the Queen was flown by helicopter from Hillsborough to Coleraine in County Londonderry, where they are guests of honour at an event marking the work of the British Legion.

The Queen ended her three day trip on a somber note as she lay a wreath as tribute to the Irish servicemen who died in the First World War.

Her Majesty and Prince Phillip were guests of honour at the commemorative event in Coleraine to mark the centenary of the outbreak of conflict and those who lost their lives in the four years that followed.

Servicemen from all over Ireland fought in the First World War, which ended three years before the island was partitioned.

Members of the Royal British Legion from both sides of the Irish border joined the Queen and Philip at the civic reception in the Town Hall.

Despite a heavy downpour, the Queen and Philip were met by hundreds of well-wishers, hoping to steal a glimpse of the royal couple.

The streets of Coleraine were 
bursting with crowds waving Union Jacks and local shopkeepers and office
 workers took a break to watch from the windows of their businesses.

The
 town created a nostalgic feel to the day with re-enactors dressed in 
period costume and, after the solemnity of the wreath laying and 
minute's silence, the Queen embarked on a walkabout to say greet some of
 her adoring fans.
