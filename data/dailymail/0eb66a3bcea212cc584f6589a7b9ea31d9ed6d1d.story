Former Arsenal striker Eduardo has announced his retirement from international football after blaming Croatia for depriving him of 'fair and honest treatment'.

The 31-year-old claims that the involvement of officials
 from outside the squad forced him to reassess his involvement following the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

The Brazilian-born forward failed to make an impact at the tournament as Croatia were knocked out at the group stages after finishing third behind Brazil and Mexico.

I'll get my Croat: Eduardo has announced his retirement from international football

Sharp shooter: Eduardo scored 29 goals in 64 games for the Croatian national team

'I inform the Croatian Football Federation that I don’t intend to play for the team in which I played 64 times since the first appearance in 2004,' Eduardo said in a statement.

'I was selected 64 times in the last 10 years, from my first match for Croatia against Ireland in 2004. I scored 29 goals, which makes me the most prolific active striker in the team.

'During the past few years for me there were several very hard moments … which are consequences of activities of people who are formally not part of the squad but have a big influence on its work and officials.

'I believe that I’m deprived of a fair and honest treatment' he added.

'With great pride and joy I played in the Croatian shirt and presented Croatian football around the world. It was important to justify the trust that the fans gave me for which I am especially grateful.

'I’m in the team among players, coaches and many other people (medical staff, technical staff, and others) who are very much, everyone in their own way, important and I made many friends.

'I also thank all the coaches who had faith in me. I will remember playing for Croatia only in a nice way.'

Horrific: The former Arsenal striker will be best remembered for breaking his leg against Birmingham in 2008

Croatia manager Niko Kovac commented: 'Thanks, Eduardo. I wish him all the luck in the world for the rest of his career.'

Arsenal signed the striker from Dynamo Zagreb for £7.5million in 2007. He scored seven goals in 41 appearances for the Gunners - but will be largely remembered for an horrific leg break following a challenge by Martin Taylor in a season defining game against Birmingham.

Many cite the incident as the reason for Arsenal failing to maintain their lead in the Premier League title race that season.
