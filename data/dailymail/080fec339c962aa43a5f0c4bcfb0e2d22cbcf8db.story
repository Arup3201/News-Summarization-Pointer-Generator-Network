From chicken fillets to surgery and plunge bras, there's no shortage of ways for women to boost their assets.

Now Abbey Clancy has appeared in a glamorous set of new photos for Ultimo in which she sports the latest addition to the nation's cleavage boosting arsenal, the overhauled OMG Plunge Bra.

The original has proved to be one of Britain's best-loved bras and was even worn by Julia Roberts to play busty blond Erin Brockovich.

Cleavage boosting: Abbey Clancy poses in the OMG plunge bra that is now 50 per cent lighter than before

The £27 bra is famous for launching the 
Ultimo brand and helping flat-chested women to add two full cup sizes to 
their cleavage without resorting to surgery.

Now the bra, which contains silicone gel that moulds around the breasts, has had a revamp and according to lingerie tycoon Michelle Mone, is now '50 per cent lighter'.

She continued: 'Owing
 to the use of advanced construction techniques, we’ve also improved its
 structure to give extra boost and projection, and added clever features
 such as the racer back clip, which gives the option to bring the straps
 together at the back.

'If women loved the original, this product is 
going to blow their minds – it’s without doubt the best, most 
comfortable and lightweight cleavage bra on the market.'

Explained: The new bra includes a racer back, fixed silicone inserts and a plunging neckline

Strictly Come Dancing winner Abbey has been the face of the brand since last December, and along with her appearance in the OMG Plunge Bra, has also starred in the company's bridal underwear campaign.

Offering her top lingerie buying tips after being offered the Ultimo job, Abbey said: 'My top lingerie tip would be to invest in two lingerie drawers - one for everyday, comfy lingerie and the other for more luxurious styles for those special occasions.'

She is the latest in a long line of glamorous women to have appeared in Ultimo campaigns, with predecessors including Luisa Lopilato, Mel B, Penny Lancaster and Rachel Hunter.
