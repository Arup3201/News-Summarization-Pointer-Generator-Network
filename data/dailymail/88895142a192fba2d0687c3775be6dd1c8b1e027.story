Meet the man who has made it his life mission to rub shoulders with the stars, setting out on a two-decade hunt to meet 5,000 celebrities. 

Jeremiah Oresky's hobby has become so costly that he has even had to take out a second job in order to continue towards his goal.

However, his hard work appears to be paying off and in the last year alone the 34-year-old has met more than 500 celebs including Bradley Cooper, Daniel Radcliffe, Martin Freeman and Emma Stone.

Over his 20 years of celebrity hunting, Jeremiah has met between 5,000 and 6,000 stars - so many in fact he can't put a specific number on them.

Jeremiah from Baltimore, Maryland, started his celebrity quest in 1994 when he met actor John De Lancie from Star Trek: The Next Generation - and became obsessed with spotting his next A lister.

'I started getting autographs at Star Trek conventions in 1994 and only started getting photos with them in 2005.'

Last year alone the 34-year-old met 500 celebrities. Pictured here with Gwen Steffani in May 2013

He now spends around £5,000 each year funding his habit. Pictured here with Piers Morgan in April 2013

Jeremiah says that at the end of the day the celebs he meets 'are just people with very cool jobs'. Pictured here with Seth Rogan in September 2013 

Now he spends up to £5,000 ($8,000) each year travelling across the US to add to his selfie collection - working two jobs to bankroll his Hollywood hobby.

Despite having met a plethora of famous faces Jeremiah claims that he still gets star struck when he meets them in person, but says he tries to keep his cool.  

'I'm usually excited when I see certain stars but I try to act as calm and normal as possible.

Jeremiah is so dedicated to his project that he has even taken on a second job to fund his hobby. Pictured here with Vanessa Hudgens in May 2014

Jeremiah is estimated to have met between 5,000-6,000 celebrities, so many in fact that he has lost count. Pictured here with Mark Ronson in November 2014 

Jeremiah does not remain impartial when it comes to celebs and admits to having favourites. Pictured here with Keanu Reeves in September 2014 

'At the end of the day they are just people with very cool jobs.' 

When it comes to picking favourites Jeremiah does not remain impartial with one particular man sticking in his memory.

'Two of the nicest celebrities include Robin Williams and Chris Pratt.  

'Robin Williams was one of the nicest guys you would ever have wanted to meet. He always made time for fans and his body of work speaks for itself.'

The celeb enthusiast says that Robin Williams and Chris Pratt were some of the friendlier celebs. Pictured here with Daniel Radcliffe in July 2014 

Jeremiah says he has received a frostier reception from Jennifer Lawrence and Sean Penn. Pictured here with David Schwimmer in May 2013 

Jeremiah says he has no plans of quitting his hobby with the ultimate goal being to meet Johnny Depp. Pictured here with Sarah Jessica Parker -date unknown

Jeremiah has met a variety of celebrities including actors, singers and television presenters. Pictured here with Jon Hamm in March 2013 

As well as having his favourites Jeremiah admits that he has met some colder characters over the course of his celeb conquest. 

'Some of the least friendly include Jennifer Lawrence, Sean Penn and Edward Norton.'

Along with the great amount of patience and research that is required in his hobby it also proves to be very costly. 

'The most expensive aspect of meeting celebrities aside from travel is attending autograph conventions where certain celebrities charge for photos and autographs.

As well as bumping into celebs on the street Jeremiah has been known to pay for autographs off 'rarer' stars. Pictured here with Emma Stone in May 2014

'I'm not against paying if it's for a rare name that I probably wouldn't have the opportunity to meet on the street and it's always nice to have a guarantee.

'Of course I always meet celebrities on the street because most celebrities don't do conventions and this is the only way to meet them.'

Although he has had to take on a second job in retail on top of his day job for the American government to pay for his hobby, Jeremiah says he has no intention of slowing down soon.

'I'll probably never stop completely but it is possible that I could tone it down a bit if I ever settle down and have a family.

'I still want to meet Johnny Depp so I won't quit before I do.'
