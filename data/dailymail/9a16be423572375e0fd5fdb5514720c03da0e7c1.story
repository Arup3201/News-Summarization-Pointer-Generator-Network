The moment a man gets down on one knee and pops the question is traditionally one of the most memorable - and private - experiences in the lives of any couple.

But this Australian bride and groom to be were astonished to discover that their intimate moment in Sydney had been shared with the world, after a stranger taking photos of the glorious sunrise over Bondi Beach accidentally captured the proposal on camera and then posted the pictures online.

Realising what had taken place between the two distant figures seen on a cliff overlooking the Pacific, the photographer posted the shots on Reddit along with the caption: 'Accidentally captured a sunrise wedding proposal this morning at Bondi Beach in Sydney.'

The touching snaps of the couple's 
magical moment - played out against the stunning backdrop of the sun 
rising over the world-famous beach - became a viral hit, and fans of the
images set about trying to identify the mystery man and his wife-to-be.

When Australian news site Ninemsn wrote a story about the search for the couple, a friend of the pair got in touch to identify them.

Ironically, the pair caught on camera turned out to be professional photographers Steven McConnell and fiancee Irene Kotov.

Proposal: Bondi Beach holds special significance for professional photographers Steven McConnell and fiancee Irene Kotov

Mr McConnell, 32, described discovering the photos of his proposal online as 'completely unreal'.'The funny thing about it is I really wanted this to be a private moment,' he told Ninemsn.

'Some people propose in front of lots of people but I really wanted to keep it intimate just between me and her, so it's kind of ironic how it turned out.'

Bondi Beach holds special significance for the couple, who have been dating for around 18 months. It is where they spent part of their first Valentine's Day together, and they have been regular visitors to the spot ever since.

Miss Kotov, 29, said it was a 'total surprise' when her boyfriend got down on one knee on her birthday.

'I had a feeling it was approaching but I didn't know it was going to happen at that moment,' she said.

The newly-engaged couple have said they are keen to meet the man who took the pictures so they can get copies of the photographs - already admired by thousands of people on the internet - for themselves.
