Drink-drive: Estate agent Tina Knowles crashed into a pipe in a petrol station forecourt while drunk

An estate agent faces jail after she crashed her BMW into a petrol pump on a garage forecourt while she was more than four times over the drink-driving limit.

Tina Knowles was apparently on her mobile phone when she careered into the petrol station and smashed into a large pipe used to release vapour from underground fuel tanks.

The garage in Driffield, Yorkshire had to be evacuated over fears the crash could endanger the public, a court heard.

In aftermath of the accident, Knowles, 43, remained in the car talking on the phone, slurring her words and ignoring the garage attendant.

David Ward, prosecuting, told Beverley Magistrates' Court that forecourt attendant Rebecca Roberts was looking out of her kiosk when she saw Knowles 'shoot across' in her silver BMW Z4.

He continued: 'It drove across the forecourt without stopping and collided with a substantial metal vapour release pump opposite the kiosk.

'The female driver appeared to be on a mobile phone at the time. Miss Roberts was initially ignored by the female driver.

'Miss Roberts could smell alcohol on her breath. She was very drunk. She could not talk properly and was slurring her words.

'Miss Roberts said to turn off the petrol pumps immediately for public safety.'

The court heard that Knowles was led into the garage's shop as staff took her keys off her and waited for police to arrive.

The estate agent 'became emotional' after the police were called, Mr Ward said, adding: 'She started sobbing. She said, "It's my car. I've f***ed up. I'm an alcoholic."'

A breath test revealed that she had 152 microgrammes of alcohol per 100ml of breath - the legal limit is 35.

Mr Ward said: 'Police were so concerned about the amount of alcohol she had drunk that they sent her to hospital to check for alcohol poisoning.

'They had never seen anyone drink that much before and get in a car and drive.'

Knowles, from Driffield, pleaded guilty to drink driving and breach of bail after she missed a scheduled court appearance this week because she was in a rehab clinic.

The court heard that last year she was spared a driving ban after she was convicted of failing to provide a specimen of breath.

Knowles has now been banned from driving ahead of a sentencing hearing next month, which could see her sent to prison.

Defending solicitor Rachel Davies said: 'There's clearly a lot of issues in her life. She freely accepts she's an alcoholic and needs help and support.'
