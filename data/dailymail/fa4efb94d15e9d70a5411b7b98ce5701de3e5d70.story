Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea insists he is happy at Old Trafford despite being tracked by Real Madrid.

The 23-year-old, who moved from Atletico Madrid to United in a £17.8million deal in 2011, has been tipped to replace Real and Spain keeper Iker Casillas for club and country.

Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti was quick to dispel talk of a move, claiming they are happy with the keepers they have, but there is a clamour among supporters and board members to bring in De Gea, who has two years left on his United contract.

United will have a big say in that though, as they inch towards agreeing a new long-term contract with De Gea. They have been encouraged further by the player's reassurance that he is content at the club.

Talking to German magazine Kicker, De Gea said: '[They are] Just rumours. I'm happy here.'

United, who are sixth in the Barclays Premier League, have yet to hit form under Louis van Gaal, and De Gea added: 'Starting problems are quite normal under a new coach with a completely new concept.

'That's a process and Van Gaal always says that we will improve, but it takes time. But without a doubt, United have to reach the Champions League again.'

De Gea also praised Sir Alex Ferguson for protecting him during his early career at United.

'It was a difficult time but Sir Alex always backed me. He saved me from criticism and was patient until I was ripe for United. Today I'm thankful for that [the criticism]. That made me stronger. Goalkeeper is a tricky position. Mistakes are human. It's about being up to that. If you make mistakes you will have to improve. Now I'm better.'
