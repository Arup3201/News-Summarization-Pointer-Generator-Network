He has a shambolic personal life and a chronic alcohol addiction which would kill a man with less seasoned liver.

Yet despite these foibles, the fictional detective is perfectly capable of cracking even the most fiendishly difficult of crimes.

Now a top police officer has called for authors to put aside the stereotypes exemplified by characters such as Ian Rankin’s Rebus in favour of clean-living coppers who are closer to real life.

Bad example: Self destructive Inspector Rebus, played here by Ken Stott, is not an accurate description of modern policing, according to Chief Constable Nick Gargan

Avon and Somerset Chief Constable Nick Gargan also said that the work done by one man in many stories would actually be carried out by a team of 40.

‘You see a Rebus or Morse at the scene, recovering forensic exhibits, interviewing the suspect, comforting the family, arguing with the chief constable about resources’, he told The Guardian.

‘What can be a team of 20, 30 or 40 people is concentrated in the person of this one senior investigator. There are some pretty damaged individuals in too many of these books.

‘I'd quite like to see some cheery, well-balanced, well-adjusted, equally successful investigators.’

Chief Con Gargan, who was speaking before a talk at Chipping Norton literary festival, said he accepted that an honest depiction of police procedure would generally put audiences to sleep.

But the Queen’s Police Medal winner added that officers had to operate within the law and a Rebus-style approach to policing was not acceptable.

Some television viewers might disagree with what he’s saying, but Mr Gargan knows the realities of the modern police force better than most crime writers.

Entering the force in 1988, he worked considerably on the investigation into the death of Princess Diana and was awarded the Queen's Police Medal in the New Year's Honours List of 2012.

Detective Inspector John Rebus, created by Scottish author Ian Rankin, on the other hand lets his personal and professional issues intertwine and often acts outside the law when making decisions, which would no doubt see him face disciplinary action if he was a real life cop.

In January a senior detective in Wiltshire Police was found guilty of gross misconduct after failing to read a killer his rights before he was led to two bodies - behaviour that shows striking similarities to Rankin's fictional character.

Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher should have repeatedly cautioned taxi driver Christopher Halliwell as he showed him where two victims, Sian O'Callaghan, 22, and Becky Godden-Edwards, 20, were buried.

The double confession was inadmissable in court because Wiltshire Police officer Mr Fulcher, 49, had broken Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) rules.

It was a scene that could have been pulled straight out of a crime novel, but with much more serious consequences for the real life detective.

'The rules and laws are there for a reason. It's not heroic to step outside the law. We shouldn't do that. We're the police', Gargan said.
