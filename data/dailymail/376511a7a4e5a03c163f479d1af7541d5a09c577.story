Model-turned-philanthropist Lauren Bush Lauren strikes a pose with cosmetics heiress Claire Courtin-Clarins in a new woodland-themed magazine shoot.

In the September issue of Town & Country, the beauties and business partners talk about how they are trying to stop world hunger and poverty with their charitable collaboration, Clarins + Feed.

Wearing whimsical fairy-like dresses and toting Mrs Bush Lauren's Feed bags, the women show off their natural beauty on the woodland set as they discuss the hunger-fighting initiative.

Mrs Bush, 29, who married David Lauren, the son of fashion designer Ralph Lauren, in 2011, launched Feed Projects in 2006.

Through the program, which sells 
bags, accessories and shirts, a portion of proceeds is donated to the 
United Nations World Food Program, which works to eliminate hunger 
worldwide.

An heir to 60-year-old French cosmetics company Clarins, 26-year-old Miss Courtin-Clarins works as an artist in New York, as well as an ambassador for her family's brand.

After
she was introduced to the granddaughter of George H W Bush by her father, Groupe Clarins chairman Christian Coutrin-Clarins, the duo decided to marry 
their respective fields with a collaborative project.

Starting September 18, Clarins 
customers who buy two products at Macy's or macys.com will receive a 
Feed tote containing six product samples.

Part of the purchase price will be donated through Feed, and will go toward ten school meals for children in need.

'What Claire and I really connect on 
is coming up with creative ways that make a difference,' Mrs Bush Lauren told the magazine.

'World hunger is 
massive, overwhelming. It's discouraging. I hope 
that what we've been able to do at Feed and together with Clarins is 
something that is uplifting.'

The duo show off their natural good 
looks on the lush set of the magazine shoot, which took place in the 
woods of Bedford, New York.

On the cover, Mrs Bush Lauren wears a white tulle Ralph Lauren Collection gown, her brunette hair in loose waves.

lacy Louis Vuitton number.

The Clarins + Feed partnership, which
has so far provided 1.5million school meals, will 
raise more money with a silent auction on October 16.

'World hunger is massive, overwhelming, discouraging. I hope we've been able to do something uplifting'

The event will see Miss Courtin-Clarins selling some of her artwork: wood and paper collage portraits of those who have inspired change, including famous philanthropists like Rosa Parks and Ghandi.

Indeed, the pair count variety as one of the keys to their success thusfar.

'One of the things I'm most proud of is that we've been able to keep reinventing the way we're working together,' said Mrs Bush Lauren. 'When things get stale or overdone, people lose interest.'
