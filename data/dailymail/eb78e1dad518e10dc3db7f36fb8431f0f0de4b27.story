An NHS hospital trust has banned reception staff from having a cup of tea at their desk because it makes them look like they might be slacking off from work

Bosses of Leicester’s three hospitals have brought in a ban on hot and cold drinks after complaints from patients who were already 'inflamed' about long waiting times.

But the move has been criticised as 'draconian' by patients at Leicester Royal Infirmary and Glenfield and Leicester General Hospitals - and even the trust admits it could prove counter-productive by encouraging workers to take more frequent breaks from their desks.

Hospital bosses in Leciester have banned reception staff, including those at Glenfield Hospital, from having drinks at their desk because it makes them look like 'they're not working hard enough'

Michelle Scowen, matron for clinical support and imaging, announced the change in an email to staff. 

She said it will no longer be permitted for staff to have drinks in the reception areas of the clinics. 

She added: 'Clearly this activity has given the wrong impression to staff and the public that clinic staff are not working as hard as they might be.

'Members of the public are frustrated by long waiting times during clinics and for appointments and are inflamed by seeing members of staff enjoying hot and cold drinks at the reception desks.'

However, staff will be allowed to have hot and cold drinks in kitchens across the departments, the Leicester Mercury reports. 

Bosses of Leicester’s three hospitals said they brought in the rules after complaints from patients who were already 'inflamed' about long waiting times

A clinic co-ordinator told the paper: 'We are often in work at 7.30-8am organising notes for the clinics which start at about 8.30am and we often don’t get time to take a break until about 1pm as clinics over-run.

'It is just wrong that we can’t have a drink in that time.'

Health campaigner Zuffar Haq added: 'This is a ridiculous and draconian measure.'

A spokesman for Leicester’s hospitals told MailOnline the decision had been taken after complaints from both other staff and patients.

He said: 'We made the decision to stop allowing staff to drink in patient areas following feedback from our patients and other staff.

'They told us that it gives a bad impression.

'Having said that, our clinic co-ordinators have expressed concern that the new rules will result in unmanned reception desks, which would also give a poor impression.

'So we will be working with our colleagues to see if we can identify an appropriate solution.'
