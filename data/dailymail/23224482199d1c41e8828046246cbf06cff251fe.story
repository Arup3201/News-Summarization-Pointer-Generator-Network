Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is in line for a £17 million windfall from the sale of his private company, which will make him the richest millionaire in Cabinet.

The Tory minister is close to striking a deal to sell Hotcourses, an education listing service set up by Mr Hunt before he became an MP.

Private equity firm Inflexion is believed to be the potential buyer, with a rumoured offer of £35 million.

Windfall: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is in line for a £17million payout when his firm Hotcourses is sold

Mr Hunt, MP for South West Surrey, is believed to own just under half the company, which means he would get around £17 million if the takeover is completed.

But the revelation sparked debate about whether millionaire ministers could relate to ordinary families struggling with soaring bills.

The Prime Minister’s spokesman refused to comment on the sale, but said: ‘One of the strengths the Prime Minister points to in the Cabinet is the range of experience reflected within it.’

Analysis of the government's senior figures reveals they are worth tens of millions of pounds between them. If Jeremy Hunt does net £17million from the Hotcourses deal, he would easily become the richest person at the Cabinet table.  The current value of the 10 wealthiest cabinet ministers is:

1. Philip Hammond £8.2m

2. William Hague £4.8m

3. Jeremy Hunt £4.8m

4. George Osborne £4.5m

5. David Cameron £3.8m

6. Francis Maude £3.2m

7. Dominic Grieve £2.9m

8. Nick Clegg £2m

9. Theresa May £1.8m

10. Owen Paterson £1.7m

Asked if he believed wealthy ministers 
should be ‘philanthropic’, he said: ‘The Prime Minister thinks one of 
the strengths of Britain is a long tradition of charitable patronage.’

Unlike others in the Cabinet – including Chancellor George Osborne and David Cameron - Mr Hunt’s wealth is self-made rather than inherited.

His father, Sir Nicholas, was an admiral in the Navy and Mr Hunt attended the private Charterhouse school before going on to get a first from Oxford.

After working as a management consultant, he moved to Japan to teach English.

While living in the Far East, he came up with the idea of the listings business.

He helped to set up the firm in 1996 with his childhood friend, Mike Elms, but stood down as director in 2009.

Hotcourses employs more than 200 people. In six months, its turnover was £6.5 million, with pre-ta profits of just under £2 million.

Mr Hunt has reaped dividends from the firm and his fortune was estimated at £4.8 million by the consultancy Wealth-X last year.

If Mr Hunt sells his stake, his wealth will balloon to more than £20 million – putting him ahead of the current richest Cabinet minister, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond who is worth around £8.2 million.

Private equity insiders have said that
Inflexion had outbid other firms to become the top contender to take 
over Hotcourses, according to Sky News.

The deal has yet to be finalised but if successful, it is expected to be completed in the weeks ahead.

An
aide to Mr Hunt refused to comment on the deal or on the size of his 
shareholding, but a person close to him insisted that he was not playing
any role in the sale negotiations.

Mr Hunt is no longer involved in the daily running of Hotcourses but Mr Elms is expected to continue running the company if Inflexion succeeds in acquiring it. Inflexion declined to comment on the talks.
