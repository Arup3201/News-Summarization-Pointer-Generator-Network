Families in a pretty fishing village are under siege from menacing seagulls that are bashing at their windows and scaring them into feeding them - in scenes reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds.

The scavengers crack their beaks against the windows of homes while families are inside eating, and have become a constant menace in the seaside community of Mevagissey, Cornwall.

The brazen birds have become so bold that they snatch snacks from people’s hands and tear open refuse sacks, leaving streets strewn with rubbish.

Cornwall Council trialled reinforced hessian bin bags in a bid to bring an end to the carnage but locals say the birds have carried on regardless.

Andy House, who runs Buckingham House Bed and Breakfast, said: 'We have a real problem with them in the village - they’re an absolute menace.

'We have a patio area in the B&B with sliding double doors where we normally feed our lovely dog Bertie.'

'But we’ve had to move the food because the birds have been tapping persistently on the window to try and get to the food.

They smack their beaks against the patio doors which makes an extremely loud noise.

'The power they generate is unbelievable - it’s much louder than a human knock. It sounds as if they’re going to break the glass.'

Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds  tells the tale of a small Northern California town under siege from birds of all kinds  which viciously attack people

Mr House, who has run the B&B for seventeen years, said the 'incredibly cocky' gulls have even flown inside to nab food and other items.

He added: 'One day they carried away a welly. They are incredibly strong.

'If you leave a normal bin bag out for five or ten minutes it will be ripped to shreds.

'If they see an opportunity for food they will go for it. You can no longer sit and eat fish and chips on the harbour as they’ll be at you.'
