It's a once in a lifetime opportunity that most would only dream about.

But for Australia's very own Tim Gibson, he has the golden ticket to turn his long-lasting wish into a reality.

The 29-year-old is no astronaut but not only is he heading outer space next year, he will also be the youngest Australian to travel beyond Earth.

Melbourne resident Tim Gibson will be the youngest Australian to travel to space early next year 

Mr Gibson was among 106 finalists sent to the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida to undergo in a rigorous week of tests by NASA in December for the worldwide competition run by the Lynx Space Academy.

For Mr Gibson, a  hotel manager in Melbourne, flying to space has been a life-long passion.

'I could fly a plane before I knew how to drive and that's when I was about 15-years-old,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'So I've always been fascinated by space and the sky.'

But while he's always dreamt of a career in piloting fighter jets for the Royal Australian Air Force, his eyesight failed him in pursuing his ultimate ambition.

'I got through to the point of enlistment but got declined after my eye test,' he said.

'I appealed that five times so that's how bad I wanted it.'

So when the next best thing came along - if not better - he seized the opportunity with both hands.

The 29-year-old, a former student from Griffith University in Queensland, says this is a dream come true

Mr Gibson thought all hope was lost, until he saw an ad on TV which spoke to him directly.

'Do you want to go to space?' it asked. Mr Gibson's answer? Yes, he did.

'I went out and bought nine cans of Lynx deodorant cans so I could enter the competition - I was pretty keen,' he said.

From one million entrants, Mr Gibson is the only Australian among the lucky 23 people selected to lift off for the space mission early next year.

Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon, was on hand to offer his congratulations to Mr Gibson in Florida.

'It's been an incredible experience so far - I never thought I'd ever meet someone like Buzz Aldrin let alone fly to space,' Mr Gibson said.

'I'm still pinching myself about it because I'm also the youngest Aussie to be flying to space.

'I can't wait to see those images of space with my very own eyes and yes, it's going to be the selfie to end all selfies.' 

The flight is scheduled to take off near Florida, powered by four liquid hydrogen rocket boosters.

'So we'll accelerate three times the speed of sound in under 60 seconds,' Mr Gibson said.

'I'll probably spend about 10 minutes in outer space, so the whole thing will be over in about an hour.' 

In the meantime, he's going to enjoy the ride with a whole new perspective.

'I hope to work in aerospace in the future,' Mr Gibson said.

'It's my passion and if I can't fly fighter jets, I'm still going to chase the dream.

'There's no better feeling of being up in the air. It just feels like I belong there.'
