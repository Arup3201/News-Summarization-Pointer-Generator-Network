Ten years ago, Manchester was in the middle of a decade of gang violence during which 112 people across the city died as a result of gun crime.

This September, the city that earned itself the nickname 'Gunchester' hopes to celebrate two years without a fatal shooting - a two-year lull since the shocking murders of two policewomen by gangster Dale Cregan.

Today police showed off some of the terrifying cache of guns seized or surrendered in the city in the last two years as they advertised a new gun amnesty in Manchester beginning tomorrow.

Looking more appropriate to a Middle Eastern battlefield than the streets of Britain, Greater Manchester Police's array includes a grenade launcher, an assault rifle, an AK-47, a light machine gun, sub-machine gun and am array of revolvers and automatic pistols.

All will be melted down, and GMP officers hope to collect even more firearms and ammunition with their new, two-week amnesty.

Between 1999 and 2009, 112 people were shot dead in Greater Manchester, but there hasn't been one fatal shooting there since Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes were shot by one-eyed Dale Cregan in September 2012.

And there hasn't been a fatal gang-related shotting since May 2009, when 16-year old schoolboy Giuseppe Gregory was shot dead by a 15-year old hitman whilst sitting the back of a car in a pub car park in Stretford.

Detective Chief Inspector Debbie Dooley, from the elite Xcalibre Task Force which was formed in 2005 to tackle the gangs said gun crime had fallen in the city year-on-year since the last amnesty in 2008.

She said: 'The last fatal gang shooting was Guiseppe Gregory, and the last fatal non-gang shootings were the tragic circumstances surrounding Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone in 2012.

'These deaths, although not recent, are still far too many. We therefore want as many weapons as possible and would encourage people to hand them in.'

Guiseppe's father, James Gregory, 42, now an anti-gun campaigner said: 'I hope this gun amnesty makes a massive difference.

'A lot of children get hold of guns because of their vulnerability - if they are growing up in a house where there is no money or too many other children it can have a grave consequence if there is no father figure.

'That child whose mother is working two or three jobs is not always there to keep an eye on him and if the mum isn't there to keep an eye on him then the streets will keep an eye on him.'

He added: 'It's easier for people to join a gang than to leave, and youngsters need an exit strategy to get out of that.

'To a person involved in weapons and guns it can only end two ways: jail or death.'

Most recent gun crime victims: Policewomen Fiona Bone, 42, and Nicola Hughes, 23, died in September 2012

Notorious murders during the height of Manchester's gun problems included the shooting of 15-year-old Jessie James, who was shot and killed on 9 September 2006 as he cycled home from a party with friends.

In one incident in 2004 panic broke out at Manchester Royal Infirmary as rival armed gangs spotted each other after a shooting and ran after each other through the hospital corridors.

But police cracked down on the gangs, and in 2001 Tommy Pitt, then 28-year-old leader of the Pitt Bull Crew, was given 30 years for murder, and in 2009 Colin Joyce, then 29, and 32-year old Lee Amos were given 35 years for two murders after being convicted of running the Gooch Close Gang.

Ian McLeod, then 42, and leader of the Dodington Gang was jailed for 21 years in 2007 for organised a botched hit which saw both his hitmen shot dead.

The amnesty begins at 7am tomorrow and will give people the chance to dispose of firearms or ammunition with no questions asked by handing it in at any GMP police station.Â  They will not face prosecution for illegal possession, and can remain anonymous.
