'It's all around a very tragic, very upsetting situation,' Joliet Police Lt. Stephen Breen told Chicago Tribune.

'The toddler had come out of the house 
unbeknownst to the driver and it appears he may have been trying to get 
in the passenger side of the SUV. He (the driver) didn't 
know he was there.'

Breen said the teen moved the car and heard a thump. When he stopped the car, he found his brother on the ground.

The shocked teenager carried Alex into the family's Providence Way home where their parents called 911.

Patch reported Alex was pronounced dead at Presence St. Joseph Medical Center.

An autopsy was expected to be completed on Monday, according to the coroner's office.

Breen said police are conducting a death investigation.
