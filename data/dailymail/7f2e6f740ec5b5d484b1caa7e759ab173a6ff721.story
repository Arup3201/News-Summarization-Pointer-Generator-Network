Pensioner Keith Quartermain, who has been locked in neighbourhood dispute for 20 years, has been told to sell his house or go to jail

A neighbour from hell was yesterday given the ultimatum: 'sell your house or go to jail' after a street dispute dating back almost 20 years.

Keith Quartermain, from Abingdon, Oxfordshire,  had been embroiled in the row with neighbours David Quick and Catherine Fillier for at least 18 years, after an initial argument over a path to the rear of their gardens.

The 67-year-old had been dragged into court several times over the past decade after repeatedly breaching a restraining order banning him from harassing the couple.

Today, he was told that the only 
option left for the court was to jail him, but that if he sold his house
he would, at least temporarily, avoid prison.

Judge
Gordon Risius was told Quartermain's home in Abingdon was on the 
market, and decided to defer his sentencing until December to give him 
time to sell the house.

'It
will be in everyone's best interests if you were to move elsewhere and 
were I to sentence you to prison today it would probably interfere with a
sale,' he said to Quartermain at Oxford Crown Court.

'So, with your agreement and in the 
interests of your neighbours, I am going to defer sentencing you for the
next five and a half months in the hope that by the time you return to 
court for sentence at the beginning of December you will have a new 
address and the opportunities for contact between you and your present 
neighbours will have been removed, or greatly reduced.'

Rachel
Drake, prosecuting, said that the long standing dispute was first 
brought to the attention of the courts in December 1994, when 
Quartermain was accused of making abusive phone calls to Mrs Fillier.

In 1997 he did the same to Mr Quick and in 2003 was first given the restraining order after he used a 'laughing machine' and hundreds of abusive signs to mock his neighbours.

Mr Quick and Mrs Fillier were subjected to a recording of the 'mechanical laughter' when at their homes and insulting signs were displayed in his garden.

'For the past 18 years there has been a difficulty in Austin Place arising out of some kind of dispute with regard to the land at the bottom of the garden and the footpath,' said Miss Drake.

'That's where the difficulties originated from and Mr Quartermain has a number of previous convictions arising out of his attitude towards his neighbours.'

The 67-year-old, pictured outside his house, has been before a judge at Oxford Crown Court numerous times for breaching a restraining order not to harass neighbours in Abingdon, Oxfordshire

Despite being told not to harass them further, Quartermain was back before a judge in 2006 and 2009 for breaching the order and given a 28 week suspended prison sentence, followed by a conditional discharge and an order to pay court costs.

However, just last month he was again 
found guilty of disobeying the court rules by insulting Mrs Fillier and 
Mr Quick on November 3 and 5 last year.

Brazen Quartermain had told the court 
he that had actually been talking about the TV show Ugly Betty when his 
crass words were overheard by a neighbour.

However, the jury disagreed and he was 
found guilty of two counts of breaching the order, although he was 
acquitted of deliberately making clapping noises to irritate his fellow 
residents.

'You feel strongly that you are the 
victim, rather than your neighbours but that does not excuse your 
criminal behaviour which the jury found had been repeated last 
November.'

Judge Risius

Tony McGeorge, mitigating, said that Quartermain had instructed an estate agent and wanted to sell his home.

'He has had two interested parties come and look at the house,' he said. 'He intends to move away from the area altogether, to the Christchurch area.'

Mr McGeorge said that his client was also undergoing counselling sessions at his local hospital, although the court was told that he did not have a personality disorder or a mental illness.

He added that Quartermain would 'welcome the opportunity' to have mediation sessions with Mrs Fillier and Mr Quick.

Judge Risius told Quartermain that even if he sold his house, the threat of a custodial sentence would still hang over him, although he said he would 'take into account any developments' when sentencing on December 7.

'You feel strongly that you are the victim, rather than your neighbours but that does not excuse your criminal behaviour which the jury found had been repeated last November,' said the judge.

'Since neither a suspended sentence nor a community requirement have had the effect on you they were intended to have, since your neighbours can not be expected to continue to tolerate you and you disregarded court orders the only appropriate sentence for you is one of immediate imprisonment.'

Speaking after the hearing, Mr Quick and Mrs Fillier expressed their doubts that Quartermain's behaviour would change - or that he would go through with the house sale.

'We'll see, it's a wait and see situation,' said Mr Quick.

In respect of the promised house sale Mrs Filler added: 'He says that every time we get to court.'
