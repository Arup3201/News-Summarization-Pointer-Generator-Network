CNN has hit back at two EMTs who sued the company after star-reporter Arwa Damon became 'seriously intoxicated' and bit them in Baghdad, Iraq in July. 

Instead of settling with Tracy Lamar and Charles Simons, the news network's lawyers hit back with a move to dismiss the case from New York Supreme Court claiming the two paramedics are money-grabbers out to ruin the reputation of CNN and a respected journalist.

The two men were allegedly injured when the 36-year-old  Beirut-based correspondent got belligerent. 

CNN is trying to dismiss a lawsuit filed by two paramedics who were apparently bitten by correspondent Arwa Damon in July, after she became 'seriously intoxicated' 

The medics were called to calm the correspondent after she became 'totally out of control,' reports the New York Daily News.

She allegedly tried to deter them by attempting a 'don't you know who I am?' tactic, telling them she was a 'major reporter for CNN,' but when this failed she became physically violent.

'She was biting them both pretty furiously. She has good teeth. Eventually they subdued her,' David Jaroslawicz, an attorney for Simons and Lamar, told the Daily News.

The suit claims she bit both Lamar and Simons on their left arms. Simons says his knees and elbows were also injured, and Lamar says she sustained bruising in the attack.

The suit claims that CNN was aware Damon had a history of drunken aggression, and was even known to be violent when sober, reports TMZ.

CNN says the paramedics are just trying to embarrass the journalist and get a million-dollar payout 

Lamar and Simons are suing CNN for $1 million each.

The network's lawyers recently filed the motion, pointing out that Lamar and Simons sued the wrong company and  in the wrong jurisdiction. 

They claim that Damon is actually an employee of subsidiary Cable News International, Inc., which is located in Atlanta, Georgia and Delaware - not New York. 

The paramedics were also criticized for their 'casual disregard' to the medical privacy of their patient, and in leaving out the fact that Damon was so injured after hitting her head that she lost consciousness and began bleeding.

'They also omit that Damon’s head injury was significant enough that U.S. Embassy personnel required her to be transported by helicopter to have a CT scan,' the dismissal reads. 

Arwa Damon is a Beirut-based correspondent who won an Emmy for Outstanding live Coverage of a Current News Story 

CNN's lawyers finally ask for the case to be dismissed since Lamar and Simons' 'plan is evident: omit material information from their Complaint, name the wrong parties in the wrong jurisdiction, try to embarrass a widely-honored journalist and claim that they are each entitled to a million-dollar payday because of an alleged bite they sustained while treating a reporter in a war zone who had a serious head injury.

'This is apparently done in the hopes that CNN America and CNN Productions settle for a large sum instead of litigating.'

Damon's biography on CNN states that she's an award-winning journalist whose recent focus has been on the situation in Syria.

She won an Emmy for Outstanding Live Coverage of a Current News Story for her reporting on the Arab Spring, as well as a Peabody Award.

Recently, she was given the Courage in Journalism Award by the International Women's Media Foundation.

She is from Boston but spent much of her childhood in Morocco and Turkey.
