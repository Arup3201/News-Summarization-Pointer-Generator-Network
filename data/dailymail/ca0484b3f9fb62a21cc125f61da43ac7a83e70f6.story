Dictator Robert Mugabe has laid into Britain describing it as 'small in mind' and a nation that had 'gone to the dogs'.

The Zimbabwe President said people with 'gay habits' in Britain should be ashamed adding that he felt 'pity' for the Queen, who he admires.

In a rare interview, the 90-year-old tyrant hit out at the Labour 'ruffians' of 1997 and branded then Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President George W Bush 'liars' over their dealings with his homeland.

Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe delivers a speech during celebrations to mark his 90th birthday in Marondera, east of  Harare, in February. He has lashed out at Britain saying it had 'gone to the dogs'

He said: 'That wisdom which the likes of Churchill had, where is it?

'You can’t see it in people now with gay habits – shame on them. I pity the one lady I admire, the Queen, that she is in these circumstances, I’m sure down deep she must be groaning (at) the loss of values in Britain.

'They’ve gone to the dogs.'

He went on to say that 'countries don't respect Britain any more' and that Prime Minister David Cameron 'doesn't talk much, but he acts in the same was as (George W) Bush'.

The extraordinary outburst also involved an attack on current US President Barack Obama who he claimed had abandoned the black population in the US.

Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe celebrated his 90th birthday earlier this year by telling Britain: 'We don't hate you, we only love our country better'

The interview, due to air tonight at 9.30pm on the BBC News Channel, came just weeks after the dictator marked his 90th birthday by telling Britain: 'We don't hate you, we only love our country better'.

As part of the £600,000 celebrations, he released 90 red balloons at a football stadium in the small farming town of Marondera in Zimbabwe.

His aides have denied reports that he is suffering from advanced prostate cancer. But speculation about Mugabe’s health has fuelled a succession struggle in the country that he has ruled since 1980.

In recent months the country has seen allegations of massive corruption in state enterprises at a time when many Zimbabweans are surviving on less than £1.20 a day.
