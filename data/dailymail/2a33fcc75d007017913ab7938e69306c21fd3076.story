Italian side Parma could be forced to cancel their game against Udinese this weekend, amid reports in Italy that they are about to go bankrupt. 

The club's players have not been paid all season, and have threatened legal action against their employer if they do not recieve some money. 

According to the Italian press, Parma have just £29,500 (€40,000) left in the bank, and may not be able to pay police and stewards for Sunday's game, leading to a cancellation.

Another alternative would be for the game to go ahead behind closed doors, to save on the costs of stewarding. 

The club have received a bankruptcy petition from the Italian government because of unpaid taxes, and have been docked a point this season for failing to pay their bills.

Club president Giampietro Manenti claimed on Monday that he had paid his players, but they had still not received any money by Thursday.

Parma are currently bottom of Serie A, and are taking advice from the league on whether they can complete their fixtures.
