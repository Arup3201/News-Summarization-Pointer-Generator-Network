Manchester City have accepted a reduced punishment for breaching Financial Fair Play regulations after agreeing a compromise with UEFA on Friday night.

As widely predicted, City have been fined a total of £48.8million (€60) by European football’s governing body.

However, £32.6m (€60) of that fine will be suspended providing the new Premier League champions meet a number of conditions.

On strike: City have an abundance of overseas stars like Argentina striker Sergio Aguero

Success: Manchester City have reaped rewards of making big-money signings

City have effectively been fined £16.2m 
of their Champions League revenue over the next two years, and will have
 their squad for the competition cut from 25 players to 21 next season.

They will only be allowed to spend a net figure of £48.8m (€60) in
 the transfer market this summer — meaning Manuel Pellegrini can 
generate extra finances by selling players — and the wage bill has been 
frozen so it remains at the same level as this season.

Whereas
 other clubs are allowed to make losses of £24.4m over two years under 
FFP rules, City’s restrictions are more specific and they can lose only 
£16m this season and £8m next season.

A
 statement from UEFA confirmed: ‘Manchester City agrees to pay a total 
amount of €60million which will be withheld from any revenues it earns 
from participating in UEFA competitions commencing in season  2013-14. 
Of this €60million an amount of €40million will be withheld 
conditionally and will be returned to Manchester City if the club 
fulfills the operational and financial measures agreed.’

City
 said they had considered challenging UEFA ‘through every avenue of 
recourse’, but decided to compromise safe in the knowledge that they 
‘will be operating without sanction or restriction at the commencement 
of the 2015-16 season’.

The 
club believe that the sanctions will only have a limited impact because 
they are on course to break even for the financial year ending May 31, 
so the issue of losses for over the next two years is not important.

City
 also insisted that the transfer and wage cap ‘will have no material 
impact on the club’s planned transfer activity’ with several players — 
including Joleon Lescott and Gareth Barry — set to leave and thus reduce
 the wage bill.

On their 
Champions League squad reduction, City pointed out that they registered 
only 23 players for this season’s competition and used 21.

They
 have also agreed to give UEFA greater clarity over their financing of 
overseas clubs Melbourne Heart and New York City FC for FFP purposes in 
future.

Restriction: Boss Manuel Pellegrini will only have a squad of 21 for Champions League next season

Meanwhile, Arsenal right back Bacary Sagna will hold formal talks with Manchester City next week.

Sagna,
 who is set to sign a four-year deal worth £100,000 a week at the 
Etihad, will head straight into talks with City before joining up with 
his France team-mates ahead of the World Cup.
