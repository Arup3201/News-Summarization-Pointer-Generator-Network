Syria has been ordered to announce an immediate ceasefire as fears mount that it will not honour an earlier promise to do so.

President Bashar al-Assad agreed to a six-point peace plan laid out by Kofi Annan this week - but as fighting rages on, hopes of peace are fading.

A spokesman for the UN-Arab League envoy today told the Assad regime: 'The deadline is now.'

His demands came as opposition activists reported yet more violence had erupted between soldiers and rebel forces in the country's northern Idlib province today.

For many the talk of a ceasefire has come too late, with fresh pictures showing the flashpoint city of Homs in ruins. More than 9,000 people have been killed in Syria's violence since last March, according to UN estimates.

Ravaged: Chunks of rubble hang precariously from the rooftops of Homs, which has stood in a state of desolation since residents endured a ruthless campaign of shelling

Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sought to work out a unified strategy on the crisis in talks with Saudi officials today.

Mrs Clinton's talks with Saudi King Abdullah and other officials come ahead of a 60-nation gathering of the Friends of the Syrian People in Istanbul over the weekend, aimed at finding ways to aid Syria's opposition.

The U.S. is hoping to help unify the splintered opposition's ranks while pushing for humanitarian aid and further isolation of Mr Assad's regime.

Saudi Arabia, along with fellow Gulf nation Qatar, has called for a more aggressive approach, including arming the rebels and carving out a safe haven inside Syria from which the opposition can operate.

Syria has accepted Mr Annan's 
six-point plan, which includes a call for a ceasefire, but the 
opposition suspects Mr Assad has no intention of stopping his crackdown 
and is only playing for time.

The
president said yesterday that he wants the plan to succeed, but 
insisted that the opposition must first commit to a ceasefire as well. 
Annan urged the Syrian government to halt its troops first.

'The government must stop first and 
then discuss a cessation of hostilities with the other side,' Annan 
spokesman Ahmad Fawzi said today.

'We are appealing to the stronger party to make a gesture of good faith. ... The deadline is now.'

'Clearly, we have not seen a cessation of hostilities and this is of great concern,' he said.

Mrs Clinton arrived in Riyadh and began talks with Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi Foreign Ministry said. The Saudi official news agency said she then met with King Abdullah in his palace in Riyadh, along with top Saudi intelligence and security officials.

'Clinton will hold extensive talks 
with Saudi counterparts on the situation in Syria and on American 
efforts to stop bloodbath in Syria,' a Saudi Foreign Ministry official 
in Riyadh said. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not 
authorised to discuss the talks.

The
talks came a day after an Arab League summit in Baghdad, where 
divisions among Arab nations over Syria were clear. In a sign that they 
see little hope in the League's diplomatic efforts, Saudi Arabia, Qatar 
and other Gulf countries sent only low-level officials to the summit.

In the end, the summit issued a joint resolution that held little new beyond expressing support for Mr Annan's efforts.

President
Barack Obama has publicly challenged Mr Assad to leave power, but has 
refused to entertain U.S. military options to achieve that end. 
Washington has said it opposes military intervention in Syria, fearing 
that it would fuel an outright civil war that could break along 
dangerous sectarian lines.

The opposition is born mainly from 
Syria's Sunni Muslim majority, while Mr Assad's regime is backed by his 
own minority Alawite community, a Shiite offshoot sect.

For
the U.S. and its allies, Syria is proving an especially murky conflict 
and one with no easy solutions. Mr Assad's regime is of Washington's 
clearest foes, a government that has long been closely allied with Iran 
and anti-Israel groups Hamas and Hezbollah.

Saudi Arabia and other Sunni-led Gulf countries are eager to see Mr Assad's fall in hopes of breaking Syria out of its alliance with their regional rival, Shiite-majority Iran.

But the Syrian opposition is chronically fragmented. The Syrian National Council, a nominal opposition umbrella group based abroad, has limited authority on the ground. Syrian army defectors have set up a military leadership based in neighbouring Turkey, but they too have only nominal command over the multiple armed rebel groups inside Syria.

The U.S. has warned that al-Qaida and other Islamic militants are also taking advantage of the turmoil, attacking Mr Assad's regime and trying to gain a foothold inside Syria.

And unlike Libya, whose leader Muammar Gaddafi inspired worldwide revulsion, Syria still has allies in Russia and Iran and a formidable army of its own.

On Thursday, Iran's supreme leader, 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, vowed to support Mr Assad during talks with the 
prime minister of Turkey, a country which was once close to Damascus but
now backs the opposition.

'Iran
will defend Syria because of [its] support of the resistance front 
against the Zionist regime and is strongly opposed to any interference 
by foreign forces in Syria's internal affairs,' Mr Khamenei said.

'The Islamic Republic of Iran is categorically opposed to any plan initiated by the U.S. regarding Syria.'

Asked what might constitute success 
for Sunday's Friends of the Syrian People meeting in Istanbul, U.S. 
State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said, 'We want to see as 
much unity as possible among those members of the opposition.'Â 

She said conversations also would focus on humanitarian aid and further isolating Assad's government.

That
is the same agenda as the first gathering of the Friends of the Syrian 
People, in February in Tunisia. There, the nations issued an ultimatum 
to Assad to end the hostilities, but it was roundly ignored.

Speaking
on Tuesday, Mrs Clinton cautiously welcomed the Syrian government's 
endorsement of Mr Annan's plan. But Mr Assad now has to make good on the
deal, she said, citing the Syrian leader's 'history of overpromising 
and under-delivering' when it comes to pledges of peace and reform.

Mrs
Clinton said the U.S. and its allies would spend the next few days 
helping Syria's primarily Sunni opposition refine its vision of an 
inclusive democracy, to assure minorities still supportive of the 
government that they'd have a place in a post-Assad future. She said 
Washington hoped for progress on that front this weekend.
