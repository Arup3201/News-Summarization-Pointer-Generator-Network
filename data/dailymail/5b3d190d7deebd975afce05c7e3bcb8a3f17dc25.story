A family who claim their five-year-old son developed facial paralysis after doctors dropped him seconds after birth are attempting to raise money for surgery that will allow him to smile.

Maddox Perales, from Marietta in Georgia, suffers from Moebius Syndrome - an extremely rare form of facial paralysis that is caused either by a genetic defect or direct trauma.

Now that Maddox is preparing to start school, his parents Charlie Perales and Danielle Templer are keen to ensure their otherwise hugely sociable son is able to make friends, so they are hoping to raise $100,000 to pay for him to have facial reanimation surgery.

Unable to smile: Maddox Perales, from Marietta in Georgia, suffers from Moebius Syndrome - an extremely rare form of facial paralysis that affects just one in a million babies

Mr Perales, a military veteran who has served twice in Iraq and once in Afghanistan, says his son was born perfectly healthy but was dropped by a doctor just minutes later.

This, he claims, is what led to Maddox developing Moebius Syndrome - a highly unusual form of facial paralysis that affects one in a million children and is caused either by genetics or injury.

'I've been through a lot in the military... It was a lot different feeling when you see your son falling, Mr Perales told USA Today.

'[The doctor] told us pretty much that he'd never be able to smile,' Ms Templer added.

'He would never be able to frown, and he wouldn't blink. I remember my therapist saying, 'Don't treat him like he's different.' So I treat him like there's nothing wrong,' she said.

Cause: Maddox's father says his son was born perfectly healthy but was dropped by a doctor just minutes later. This, he claims, is what led to Maddox developing Moebius Syndrome

For the most part the disorder does not impact of Maddox's life and he is a hugely bubbly character - happily chatting to his parents, rarely sitting still and always keen to re-watch the DVD of his favourite animated film, Frozen.

It is only when Maddox wants to express joy that it becomes obvious he is not like other young boys.

Instead of expressing emotion using his facial muscles, Maddox uses his hands to force his mouth into a smile - a heartbreaking move that is making his parents concerned for his immediate future.

Later this year Maddox will start school, where he will need to make friends by himself - something his mother and father are worried he will struggle to do with a face unable to convey friendliness.

As a result, Mr Perales and Ms Templer have set up a GoFundMe page in the hope of raising $100,000 for Maddox to have facial reanimation surgery.

The operation will repair damage to the boy's facial muscles and nerves and will eventually give him his smile back, Ms Templer says.

'Everyone deserves a smile and so I won't stop until my son has a smile on his face too,' she added.

'It's not the desire to make him smile,' Maddox's father said. 'Smiling is just something we do on the outside. It's the desire for him to be happy.'
