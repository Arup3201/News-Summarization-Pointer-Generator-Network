A Montana woman on trial for the death of her new husband showed little emotion when she located his body in Glacier National Park days after she told authorities he had driven off with friends and disappeared, friends of the woman testified.

Jordan Graham, 22, said after finding Cody Johnson's body that now a funeral could be held and 'the cops can be out of it,' friend Hannah Sherrill testified yesterday.

Graham, her mother, brother and friends drove to the park twice in the days after Johnson, 25, went missing on July 7.

Graham climbed down a steep slope to a ledge below the roadway and she called out that she spotted the body in a ravine below the cliff.

Running out of allies: The teenage brother of Jordan Graham, seen leaving court on Monday, broke down on the stand today as he told how he grew frustrated with her changing stories during her husband's disappearance

'And then after that she didn't really show any emotion,' friend Cecilia Lewellen said.

Prosecutors say Graham knew where the body was located all along.

They
claim she deliberately pushed Jordan from that spot during an argument 
about her doubts over their eight-day-old marriage when she could have 
walked away.

Graham has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder, second-degree murder and making false statements to authorities.

Her
defense attorneys said the two got into a heated argument that ended 
when Johnson grabbed Graham's arm, she pushed back to knock his hand off
and he fell from the narrow ledge.

She
lied about Jordan's disappearance at first because she was afraid 
nobody would believe that it was an accident, her attorneys said.

Found: Jordan led a search party to the spot in Glacier National Park where she knew Cody Johnson's body was

Graham's
brother, Michael Rutledge, testified earlier yesterday that he was 
angry with Graham because she had lied again and again.

'She could have told us the truth,' Rutledge testified, sobbing.

'She
told one lie, was asked to tell the truth, and she said it again. And 
she had to keep adding more lies to cover it up. And that's maybe why I 
was mad.'

The 
testimony came on the second day of trial for Graham, as prosecutors 
dissected her actions from the time her husband went missing on July 7 
until his body was found on July 11 in the national park.

Using videotaped statements by Graham and text messages from her friend and her brother, prosecutors showed how her story unravelled.

Rutledge testified that he was close to his sister and the 25-year-old Johnson.

He said he was with Graham on July 10, when they went with their mother and two friends to a spot called The Loop to look for Johnson's body, but it was too dark to see.

They returned the next day, and Rutledge told jurors he wondered why they had gone back to the same place.

'Why aren't we going to other spots? This park is huge,' Rutledge said he recalled thinking.

'But I didn't say anything because I didn't want anyone to be upset with me.'

Graham said she couldn't see anything from the road, but she had a feeling, Rutledge said. The others watched as Graham climbed over a retaining wall and made her way down a treacherous rocky slope.

Downward spiral: Her defense attorneys are now arguing that Graham, seen here dancing with her husband at their wedding just eight days before his death, was having post-wedding 'blues'

She walked along the ledge for a while then shouted that she spotted a body in a ravine, Rutledge said.

'When Jordan claimed she saw Cody, I was in disbelief, so I went down myself,' he said.

Rutledge saw the body and said he 'lost it.'

He
said he climbed back up to the road and sat at the edge of the rocks 
while his sister and a friend went to report the finding to park 
rangers, who prosecutors said were surprised that she had been able to 
find the body from that location.

After Graham pointed out the body, investigators questioned her further.

When shown a picture of her and Johnson at the gate of the park, she dropped her story about him going missing after leaving with friend.

Close: Jordan's brother Michael said that he had grown close with her sister's husband, Cody (pictured with Jordan), during the two years that the couple dated before their wedding

Graham told them that she and Johnson had argued in the park over their eight-day-old marriage and that he accidentally fell from a cliff when she tried to remove his hand from her arm.

There were no witnesses to what happened the night of July 7.

Andy
Nelson, Graham's federal public defender, has said Johnson's death was a
tragic accident that occurred after she had finally worked up the nerve
to talk to Johnson about her grave doubts about their marriage.

When he grabbed her during a heated argument, she pushed him to remove his hand, the lawyer said.

Graham did not want to report the accident because she was afraid, and in her naivete, invented an implausible story, the lawyer said.

Explain herself: Jordan, seen here at an October court appearance, will be faced with the task of explaining her bizarre behavior in the days after her husband's death when she lied to family, friends and the police

She told different slightly different 
versions to people about how Johnson had left that night with friends 
Graham did not know, her friend Kimberly Martinez and police said.

'I was trying to give Jordan the benefit of the doubt, but things weren't adding up for me,' Martinez said.

Kalispell police Sgt. Chad Zimmerman, who interviewed Graham the day after Johnson was reported missing, also said her story did not match up with what others had told him.

'I had no way of knowing how much she was saying was true and how much not true,' Zimmerman testified.

Graham returned to the Kalispell police station the next day, saying she had received an email from a person she didn't know named 'Tony' who told her that Johnson was dead and to call off the search.

Another detective interviewed her about the email and Johnson's disappearance, and Graham's details of that night appeared to contradict what she had told Zimmerman the day before.

The email turned out to be a fabrication, sent from an account created that day from a computer belonging to Graham's stepfather, authorities said.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
