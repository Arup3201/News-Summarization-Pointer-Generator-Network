Flight Centre's co-founder Geoff Harris has snapped up an  English style manor home in Albert Park for a cool $12 million - smashing the exclusive Melbourne suburb's property sale record by $2million.

Hollyford, a heritage-listed home on St Vincent Place, is the first sale to go under the hammer for more than $10 million in Albert Park.

The 1873 property was built 17 years after the development of the street with Hollyford's concept modelled on the 'English idea of houses clustered around its central landscape gardens,' according to Property Observer.

The 480 square metre block last sold for $2.2 million in 2002 to the Ryans family who purchased the property way back in 1899. They coined the property 'Hollyford', after a small village in County Tipperary, where the family was from.

Mr Harris' new property has restored front rooms of an Italiante Victorian double fronted house along with a full width linear pond which marks the transition to the modern from informal living spaces flowing onto the garden and lap pool.

The former vice-president of AFL club Hawthorn is estimated to be worth $975 million, according to the latest BRW rich list. The millionaire, quit duties at Flight Centre in 1998.
