An Australian-born Cossack is reportedly being monitored by ASIO after he flew to Ukraine to support pro-Russian separatists.

Simeon Boikov from Cabramatta in Sydney's west is the ataman, or leader, of The Zaibakal Cossack Society of Australia, and put a call out for others to join him in the fighting overseas, according to The Daily Telegraph.

The 24-year-old would not confirm to the publication whether he had been in the rebel-held city of Donetsk, but insisted it was irrelevant as he is 'not breaking the laws of Australia by going overseas to help people.'

Simeon Boikov is said to have taken up arms overseas fighting with pro-Russian separatists, the same rebels accused of downing MH17

The separatists he claims to have flown overseas to assist have been blamed for the downing of fatal Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 which was shot down over eastern Ukraine almost two weeks ago.

They have also been fighting in the areas surrounding the crash site making it impossible for any further investigation or retrieval of the victims' bodies to go ahead.

Ukraine intelligence are said to have intercepted a phone call just days after the tragedy and heard the firing attributed to 'those Cossacks who are based in Chernukhino.'

Boikov's closest friend said he believed Boikov had been in Donetsk with a two-star Russian general

Historically, the Cossacks are East Slavic people found mostly in Ukraine and southern Russia, who formed democratic and semi-military communities.

Father Alexander Paramonov, a Russian Orthodox Priest and Boikov's closest friend said he believed Boikov had been in Donetsk with a two-star Russian general.

Boikov claimed to have fired machine guns, and been at the controls of tanks, but Paramonov said this had only taken place during training exercises. What exactly his friend was training for he did not know.

Boikov is the head of The Zaibakal Cossack Society of Australia, which is said to have around 150 members

He lives in Sydney and reportedly frequents the Russian Sports and Social Club at Kemps Creek, in Sydney's west

ASIO have apparently been keeping an eye on Boikov, but the 24-year-old is aware of this and insisted he is not a threat.

The government have also been keeping tabs on any Australians going to fight in the Middle East, and have said anyone who goes overseas to fight could face a length jail term on their arrival back in Australia.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Boikov for comment.

The Cossack society which Boikov is the head of is said to have around 150 members, and its headquarters are at the Russian Sports and Social Club at Kemps Creek, in Sydney's west.

A staff member at the Russian Sport and Social Club told Daily Mail Australia: 'I do not know what he is doing.'

Fighting in the area surrounding the MH17 crash site has halted any international investigation

MH17 was shot down from the sky nearly two weeks ago killing all 298 people on board the plane

The Zaibakal Cossack Society of Australia is recognised by the Trans-Baikal Cossack Army in Siberia. It is connected to other groups nationwide, including three in Victoria and one in Tasmania.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop is currently in Kiev involved in ongoing negotiations with investigators to gain access to the crash site.

More than 100 extra Australian Federal Police Officers were deployed to the area earlier this week but are yet to have visited the site due to fighting in the area.
