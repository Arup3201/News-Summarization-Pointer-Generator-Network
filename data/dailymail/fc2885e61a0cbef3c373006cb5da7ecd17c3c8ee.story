Former elite referee Mark Halsey is expected to leave BT Sport at the end of the season following the failed experiment of having an ex-official in the gantry alongside the match commentator.

However, Halsey's demise also follows a serious falling-out with his former employers at the  Professional Game Match Officials after he criticised refereeing standards and called for the head of PGMO boss Mike Riley in a newspaper article.

After Halsey’s incendiary comments were published, BT Sport allegedly reacted to huge pressure from the Premier League by taking him off their live coverage. Promises from the network at the time that he would stay fully involved in other football programming have not materialised.

And it’s believed that Halsey, who has remained on the BT payroll, will be quietly paid off in June, the station not wanting to further antagonise the Premier League with the next TV rights tender possibly starting in November.

A BT spokesman said: ‘Mark Halsey is a regular contributor,’ although the controversial referee has not been seen on screen since last December.

The PL have repeatedly insisted they have not interfered in BT’s use of Halsey. Yet the 52-year-old sent an email to his lawyers at London’s Pump Court Chambers that read: ‘Richard Scudamore (PL chief executive) rang Marc Watson, the head man of BT, demanding they sack me. I received a phone call from Grant Best (BT football chief) telling me I had been stood down due to the article.’

The RFU’s initiative of having the England team bond with supporters will see the players walk through the packed Twickenham west car park on Saturday rather than take the team bus all the way into the stadium.

And fliers will be handed out at the railway station publicising the 2.30pm arrival of the team coach ahead of the Ireland game. Yet they still want to keep the long walk informal by not announcing the players’ names as they leave the bus, as Manchester City do at the Etihad Stadium.

There could be another twist to the provocative decision by MCC to ask England outcast Kevin Pietersen to play in their bicentenary showcase match against the Rest of the World at Lord’s on July 5.

The only previous occasion on which KP played for MCC was in the 2004 game against champion county Sussex, when the Lord’s team was captained by Andy Flower and included Alastair Cook - his two arch-critics. That memory might be enough for Pietersen to decline his invitation.

Newcastle manager Alan Pardew has been offered a BBC Radio 5 Live pundits’ gig at the World Cup despite the troubles with his struggling Premier League side. Another manager under siege, Manchester United’s David Moyes, has not committed to media overtures to work in Brazil knowing it would not impress fans who will expect him to be scouting full-time for players.

Laudrup agent riddle

No proper explanation was given by axed Swansea manager Michael Laudrup at his Heathrow press conference this week as to whether his close ties with Turkish agent Bayram Tutumlu played any part in his exit.

But certainly Swansea insiders believe Laudrup’s loyalty to long-time adviser Tutumlu - whom Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins refused to involve in transfer dealings - contributed significantly to the split.

Tutumlu said on Thursday: ‘People can say what they want but Michael doesn’t think it was anything to do with me and nor do I. We’re moving on, the past is the past.’

Cheltenham Festival’s cluttered sponsorships makes a scrap among bookmakers keen to maximise publicity for their races inevitable.

The first day has the biggest potential for a bust-up, with Cheltenham somehow allocating sponsorship rights to both Sky Bet and Stan James. And that’s before ambush marketing specialists Paddy Power seek to hijack attention.

There is much anticipation as to how Ravel Morrison, QPR’s new loan signing from West Ham, and Joey Barton will rub along in the Loftus Road dressing room.

However, while Barton is never short of an opinion whatever the subject, Morrison is said to be quiet and unassuming, though he did stand up for himself at Upton Park concerning his own management representation.
