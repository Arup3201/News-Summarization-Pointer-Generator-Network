Chelsea flop Fernando Torres is among eight Premier League players named in Spain’s provisional World Cup squad.

The 30-year-old has scored five Premier League goals this season and just 20 in total since his £50million move to Stamford Bridge in 2011.

But Torres could yet head to Brazil with the reigning world champions having been included in the 30-man group announced on Tuesday.

Golden boy? Torres is still well thought of in Spain despite his struggles in England

There is no place, however, for Spurs 
stiker Roberto Soldado after he returned just one goal during his maiden
 campaign in the English top-flight.

Boss Vicente Del Bosque also included Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and midfielder Juan Mata, Chelsea’s Cesar Azpilicueta, Arsenal’s Santi Cazorla and Manchester City trio David Silva, Jesus Navas and Alvaro Negredo.

Uncapped Dani Carvajal and Ander Iturraspe were the surprise call-ups. Carvajal has made rapid progress this season at Real Madrid having taken the regular right-back slot from Alvaro Arbeloa, who was one of the surprise omissions from the squad. Midfielder Iturraspe has been a crucial cog in the Athletic Bilbao team which has qualified for the Champions League.

Spain are in Group B along with the Netherlands, Chile and Australia.

Goalkeepers: Iker Casillas (Real Madrid), Pepe Reina (Napoli), David De Gea (Manchester United)

Defenders: Cesar Azpilicueta (Chelsea), Gerard Pique (Barcelona), Sergio Ramos (Real Madrid), Jordi Alba (Barcelona), Alberto Moreno (Sevilla), Javi Martinez (Bayern Munich), Raul Albiol (Napoli), Juanfran Torres (Atletico Madrid), Dani Carvajal (Real Madrid)

Midfielders: Sergio Busquets (Barcelona), Xabi Alonso (Real Madrid), Koke Resurreccion (Atletico Madrid), Ander Iturraspe (Athletic Bilbao), Xavi Hernandez (Barcelona), Thiago Alcantara (Bayern Munich), Pedro Rodriguez (Barcelona), Jesus Navas (Manchester City), David Silva (Manchester City), Cesc Fabregas (Barcelona), Juan Mata (Manchester United), Santi Cazorla (Arsenal), Andres Iniesta (Barcelona)

Forwards: Diego Costa (Atletico Madrid), David Villa (Atletico Madrid) Fernando Torres (Chelsea), Alvaro Negredo (Manchester City), Fernando Llorente (Juventus)
