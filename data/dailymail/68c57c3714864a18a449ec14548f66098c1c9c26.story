A new test for prostate cancer could spare thousands of men needless treatment which leaves them with debilitating side effects, researchers claim.

The test can accurately pinpoint the less harmful tumours which do not have to be immediately removed by surgery or radiotherapy.

Prostate is the most common form of cancer in men. There are 41,000 new cases in Britain a year, mostly among the over-65s.

Despite half of all prostate tumours being less harmful varieties, 90 per cent of patients have surgery because they are difficult to distinguish from deadly ones

Around half have a low-risk type of prostate cancer which is not fatal and is highly unlikely to spread to other parts of the body.

Yet due to a lack of effective tests, it is extremely difficult to distinguish between deadly tumours and less harmful ones.

As such, more than 90 per cent of prostate cancer sufferers undergo surgery or radiotherapy which can cause incontinence and leave them infertile.

But a team of British and American researchers believe a new test called Prolaris could spare thousands of men this treatment, enabling them to live normal lives.

It costs £1,700 a time but the academics say by using it the NHS would save money as expensive radiotherapy and surgery could be avoided.

The £1,700 test can determine whether a tumour is deadly or not and the makers say it will save money on expensive surgery and radiotherapy

A trial of the test involving 1,500 men, which will be presented at the National Cancer Research Institute conference in Liverpool, shows that it accurately distinguishes between fatal tumours and the less harmful.

Professor Jack Cuzick, a scientist at Cancer Research UK who is based at Queen Mary University of London, said: ‘Over-treatment of prostate cancer is a serious issue so it is essential that we have an accurate way of spotting those cancers that pose an immediate risk.

‘For patients with slow-growing tumours, it’s far safer and kinder to watch and wait. We’ve shown this test is accurate at telling apart these two different tumour types at different stages of treatment.’

The test works by analysing the genetic make-up of the tumour after a small piece has been removed. It then gives the patient a score from –3 and +3, with those at the top end suffering a more aggressive form.

Presently the test can only be analysed in a lab in the US state of Utah so doctors have been reluctant to use it as they have to send samples away.

But researchers are carrying out further trials on its effectiveness and hope it will be considered by NICE, the drugs rationing body, for NHS use.

Dr Harpal Kumar, of Cancer Research UK and chairman of the National Cancer Research Institute, said: ‘Understanding more about the nature of a patient’s tumour could spare thousands of men from unnecessary treatment and the resulting side effects.’

Last week, figures from Cancer Research UK showed the amount of men dying from prostate cancer has fallen by a fifth in 20 years due to better diagnosis and treatment.

However, campaigners say too many men are being failed because of the lack of effective tests.
