The 87th Academy Awards are less than a week away, and Wednesday in Los Angeles preparations began for the most important part of the night - the red carpet.

The actual carpet was laid out along Hollywood Boulevard while a dozen giant Oscar statues were brought out to line the carpet.

The awards will air this Sunday night on ABC.

Back in New York, fashion week continued on, with many designers no doubt hoping that one of the looks they sent down the runway would find its way to Sunday's ceremony. 

Neil Patrick Harris will host this year's show, which will feature A-list nominees including Julianne Moore, Reese Witherspoon, Keira Knightley and Meryl Streep, to name just a few.

Among the presenters will be last year's winners in the acting categories Jared Leto, Lupita Nyong'o, Matthew McConaughey and Cate Blanchett.

Birdman and The Grand Budapest Hotel lead all films with nine nominations, and both are nominated for Best Picture.

The other Best Picture nominees are Boyhood, The Imitation Game, The Theory of Everything, Whiplash, Selma and American Sniper.
