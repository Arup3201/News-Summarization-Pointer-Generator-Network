Christine Wyvell was handed an 18 month prison sentence suspended for two years after she provided her neighbour with a prescription drug, 100 times stronger than morphine, which may have contributed to his death

A pensioner who gave her neighbour a prescription drug 100 times stronger than morphine, which may have contributed to his death, has avoided jail.

Christine Wyvell, 69, said she had been trying to ease Gary Vickerson's back pain when she gave him the Fentinol patches, even though she had been warned they were strictly for her own use.

Wyvell gave a packet of 100mg patches and two unknown tablets to Mr Vickerson, 39, after they met in a pub on Canvey, Essex.

He collapsed and died alone in his caravan just hours later - on what would have been his 40th birthday.

Wyvell, of Thorney Bay Caravan Park, Canvey, was handed an 18-month prison sentence suspended for two years when she appeared at Basildon Crown Court yesterday.

Charlotte Davidson, prosecuting, told the court Wyvell had been celebrating her birthday at a pub on Canvey when she met Mr Vickerson, who lived on the same caravan park, and his friend Anita Lynch.

During the course of the evening Mr Vickerson told her that he was suffering severe back pain - a recurring problem caused by a serious cycling accident when he was 17.

The court heard Wyvell told him she had prescription pain killers that could help, which she had been given by her doctor.

Later Wyvell took Mr Vickerson and Miss Lynch back to her caravan and handed him two unknown tablets and a packet of Fentinol.

She told him that she was giving him painkillers so strong they would be categorised as class A drugs and that he should not take them with alcohol.

The court heard this was despite Wyvell knowing he was drunk.

The next day, Mr Vickerson did not answer telephone calls from friends, family or work colleagues.

Four days later he was found dead on the floor of his caravan by a colleague after he did not turn up for work.

Police initially did not treat Mr Vickerson’s death as suspicious and the court heard officers did not take a full inventory of what was in his caravan.

Because the death was not treated as suspicious a post-mortem was not carried out on Mr Vickerson’s body for eight days - which meant doctors struggled to carry out an accurate drug test.

Fentinol, however, was discovered in his system.

One doctor wrote a report to say that Fentinol contributed to his death while another said it could have.

In mitigation, Wyvell told the court that Mr Vickerson’s death played on her conscience every day.

She admitted one count of supplying class A drugs.

Sentencing Wyvell, his honour Judge David Owen-Jones, said the case was so unusual that normal sentencing guidelines did not apply.

He said: 'It is clear from the evidence that your doctor had prescribed you with Fentinol, a drug 100 times more potent than morphine.

The mother of a man who was found dead after taking class A painkillers, has paid tribute to him.

Gary Vickerson, was found dead on the floor of his caravan at the Thorney Bay Caravan park on Canvey in November 2012.

Yesterday his neighbour, Christine Wyvell, 69, was handed an 18-month suspended sentence for supplying him with class A drug and painkiller, Fentinol.

Gary worked as an overhead linesman for Babcock and had lived on Canvey for eight years after moving to Essex from his native Yorkshire.

His mother, Anne Vickerson, 71, who still lives near Doncaster, said: 'He was a very good conversationalist and was very popular.

'He was a keen cyclist, but had a serious cycling accident in his teens which had a big impact on his life.

'He had other hobbies and played the trumpet.

'Gary never went to university but was still extremely well read and particularly like JRR Tolkien, the author of the Hobbit.

'He was never married and did not have children - that’s one of the big regrets of his life I think.'

'You had been warned that the patches were only to be used by you and that they could cause harm to another person if given to them.

'Even if they displayed the same symptoms as you.'

Following the hearing, Mr Vickerson's sister Adele Bailey said: 'This has been a nightmare. There were mistakes made at the beginning which meant my brother’s death was not treated as suspicious.

'Then the coroner’s office was told he had been prescribed the Fentinol which was not correct.

'This case has had a horrendous impact on my family. Every day we have been thinking about this case and we have not been able to move on and grieve.

'All I have ever wanted is justice for my brother.'

Prosecutor Charlotte Davidson told the court a 'breakdown in communication' was responsible for mistakes made by paramedics and the coroner’s office.

She said a post mortem on Mr Vickerson’s body was not carried out for eight days, which meant drug tests on his body were less accurate.

It was not until May 2013 when Anita Lynch - the woman who had been drinking with Mr Vickerson and Wyvell on the night of his death - came forward to give a statement that police launched an investigation and Wyvell was arrested.

In September 2013, Wyvell appeared in court accused with supplying class A drugs, however last minute concerns raised by Mr Vickerson’s family meant that the case was adjourned so that prosecutors could assess whether there was enough evidence to charge her with manslaughter.

The case was sent to Chelmsford where it was set to be tried by a High Court Judge, but last week Mr Vickerson’s family were told there was not enough evidence to proceed with a manslaughter charge and yesterday Wyvell pleaded guilty to the charge of supplying class A drugs.
