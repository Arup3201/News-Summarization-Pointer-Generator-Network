With the media storm that's surrounded Vanessa Stiviano lately, you can't blame her for wanting to cut loose with a few Margaritas.

So with the row continuing over reviled Clippers owner Donald Sterling, V. Stiviano forgot all about her troubles and stepped out to celebrate Cinco de Mayo - in another now-trademark visor.

The 31-year-old - who taped the NBA millionaire berating
 her for hanging around with black players - was seen outside her $1.8million Los Angeles home in patriotic attire.

Vanessa Stiviano, whose mother is Mexican, wore her now-trademark visor and a sombrero to celebrate Cinco de Mayo, a festival of Mexico's independence

The 31-year-old was seen outside her Los Angeles home sipping on Margaritas to mark the annual celebration

V. Stiviano hit the headlines after a tape she recorded, which allegedly includes racist rants from 80-year-old Clippers owner Donald Sterling, was leaked to the press

Despite the controversy, V. Stiviano still took time to wave at photographers outside her home

The model dressed in denim overalls, a traditional sombrero and a Mexican bandana, which she hung around her neck, to mark Mexico's festival of independence.

Cinco de Mayo - 'fifth of May' - is a celebration of Mexico's independence and 
culture, marking the country's victory over the French army in the Battle of Puebla in 1862.

V. Stiviano, whose mother is Mexican, used the day as an excuse to wear yet another full-faced visor - an accessory she hasn't been seen without since the start of the Sterling storm.

The self-styled philanthropist, who wore a red hologram hat as she handed out Margarita cocktails to her friends, has been spotted wearing a selection of visors since the scandal broke, including while roller-blading, to a car wash and in a nail salon.

She even sported a second visor - this time a reflective black face shield - after changing into her evening party wear.

Donald Sterling is yet to be seen in public since the controversy, but V. Stiviano has made several appearances

The model, who was brought up in Texas but is half-Mexican, is more used to wearing visors than sombreros

She had trouble holding onto the traditional hat as she celebrated Cinco de Mayo with friends

V. Stiviano, who was brought up in San Antonia, Texas, made headlines worldwide after a tape, allegedly of the LA Clippers owner, was leaked to the media.

In the tape, recorded by V. Stiviano, Mr Sterling is apparently heard attacking her for publicly befriending black NBA players like Magic Johnson.

'It
 bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that youâ€™re associating 
with black people. Do you have to?' Sterling allegedly says.

The media storm surrounding the tapes didn't stop V Stiviano 
going out to have a good time

She donned a second outfit - complete with a second visor - as she carried on celebrating Cinco de Mayo into the evening

'Iâ€™m just saying, in your lousy f******* Instagrams, you donâ€™t have to have yourself with, walking with black people.

'Don't put 
him (Johnson) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have 
to call me.  And don't bring him to my games.'

Stiviano refers to herself only as V. Stiviano and says she was not Sterling's lover but his 'archivist'.

V Stiviano, who refers to herself as only that, says she was not Sterling's lover but his 'archivist'

The 80-year-old billionaire was allegedly taped telling V. Stiviano that she 'broadcast' associating with black people

Billionaire Sterling, 80, is battling prostate cancer and has already outlived the life expectancy given to him by doctors.

He
 is fighting the forced sale of his team after being banned from the NBA
 for life. He was also fined $2.5 million - the league maximum.

V.
 Stiviano, who described herself as Sterling's 'silly rabbit,' 
has pubilcly said she does not believe Mr Sterling is a racist.

V. Stiviano also donned a visor while roller blading and going to the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles
