Al-Shabaab has released a graphic video calling for 'Westgate-style' attacks on shopping centers including the Mall of America  - prompting officials to drastically tighten security at the iconic site.

In the video, apparently released by the Somalia-based terror group's media wing, a masked militant also encourages radicalized Muslims to assault malls in Canada and  Oxford Street in London.

Donning a camouflage jacket with a headscarf covering his face, the fighter threatens action and refers to the  group's 2013 siege on Kenya's Westgate Mall, in which more than 60 people died.

The Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, is specifically targeted. Chillingly, an image of the center is shown in the corner of the frame, while its GPS co-ordinates are displayed in a white font.

Speaking directly to the camera, the unnamed militant says: 'If just a handful of mujahideen fighters could bring Kenya to a complete stand-still for nearly a week, just imagine what the dedicated mujahideen could do in the West to American or Jewish shopping centers across the world.'

He adds: 'What if such an attack were to occur in the Mall of America in Minnesota? Or the West Edmonton Mall in Canada? Or in London's Oxford Street?'. 

Now, the Mall of America is taking 'extra security precautions' in light of the threat. Officials are reportedly working closely with the FBI and America's Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Some of the new security measures will be visible to shoppers, while others will not, a security official told CBS News, adding that employees 'will remain diligent as they would do in any similar situation.'

Speaking to Fox News, Jim Kallstrom, the former assistant director of the FBI’s New York office, said the bureau has a 'huge job' in front of them in the wake of the threatening online video.

Warning: On Sunday, US homeland security chief Jeh Johnson (pictured) urged shoppers to be on their guard while visiting the Mall of America, which is nation's largest shopping center, with 40million visitors a year

Crowded: 'I would say that if anyone is planning to go to the Mall of America today, they've got to be particularly careful,' Mr Johnson said  on CNN's 'State of the Union.' Above, the busy interior of the mall

'You look at the Mall of America, you look at all the malls, then you start to backtrack and say it would be nice if we knew what comes and goes into the country,' he said. 'We don’t have a clue.' 

On Sunday, US homeland security chief Jeh Johnson urged shoppers to be on their guard while visiting the Mall of America - the country's largest shopping center, with 40million visitors a year.

'I would say that if anyone is planning to go to the Mall of America today, they've got to be particularly careful,' Mr Johnson said during an appearance on CNN's 'State of the Union.' 

'This latest statement from al-Shebaab reflects the new phase we've evolved to in the global terrorist threat in that you have groups such as al-Shebaab, ISIL [ie. the Islamic State, or ISIS], publicly calling for independent actors in their home lands to carry out attacks.

'We're beyond the phase now where these groups would send foreign operatives into countries after being trained someplace.'

He added that he was 'very concerned' about the potential threat 'lone wolf terrorists' pose to shopping centers across the US. 'Any time they call for an attack against a specific place, we've got to take that seriously,' he said.

Another DHS official later clarified that Mr Johnson's did not mean shoppers should avoid  the Mall of America - only that they should be 'extra vigilant' and should be aware that security is increased.

Shortly after the Westgate Mall incident in September 2013, al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack and estimated 67 deaths. Around 200 people were also injured in the days-long assault.

In the newly-released video, al-Shabaab runs a documentary-style account of the deadly attack, complete with images of terrified men, women and children running for their lives through the mall.

The masked militant then appears on-screen and suggests similar attacks could be carried out on the Mall of America, the West Edmonton Mall in Canada, or London's popular Oxford Street.

The footage, apparently posted online by the Islamic group, also includes six minutes of graphic images of terrorist activity and discusses Kenyan forces' intervention in Somalia, it is reported.

Minnesota, where the Mall of America is based, is home to a sizeable Somali population. U.S. law officials have been concerned about the potential for radicalization among some of the community.

Last week, a Minnesota man was charged with conspiring to support ISIS - which has taken over swathes of Iraq and Syria - and lying to federal agents investigating recruitment by militant groups.

Prosecutors said dozens of people from the Minneapolis-St. Paul area - many, Somali-Americans - have traveled or attempted to travel overseas to support ISIS or al-Shabaab since 2007.

The Mall of America, which is privately run and attracts millions of people every month, contributes nearly $2 billion in annual economic activity to the state of Minnesota, according to its website. 

On Sunday, mall officials issued a statement about the threat made by al-Shabaab, saying they are monitoring events with the help of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.

'The Mall of America has implemented extra security precautions, some may be noticeable to guests, and others won't be,' the officials said. 

The West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, Canada, draws an estimated 30.8 million visitors a year. according to its website. Meanwhile, Oxford Street is one of London's busiest shopping areas.
