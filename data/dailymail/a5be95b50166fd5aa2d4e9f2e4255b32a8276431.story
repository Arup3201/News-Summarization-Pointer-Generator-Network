An exclusive private members' club set up by Eurythmics star Dave Stewart has been slated by food hygiene inspectors who found mouse droppings littered around the kitchen.

The seven-floor Hospital Club, in Covent Garden, was set up Stewart and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen ten years ago, and has hosted performances by the likes of The Who, Bastille and Johnny Marr.

But mouse droppings were found throughout the kitchens, including in a pastry area next to a microwave, leading inspectors to give the club the lowest possible hygiene rating - a zero.

The central London club was pulled up on 23 points related to poor food hygiene.

Inspectors found mouse excrement around ovens, behind wheeled containers, between equipment, by a wall and inside the vent section of an ice cream machine.

Inspectors said: 'The head chef immediately ordered his staff to clean and disinfect the affected areas. However, such areas must be routinely inspected every day and any signs of infestation reported to your pest contractor.

'Such areas will need to be cleaned and disinfected after any signs of pest activity.'

Other problems included the club using a vacuum packing machine, used for sealing food, for both raw and cooked meals - posing a risk of cross-contamination.

Spoons were being stored in contact with sauces in a fridge, there was no evidence of fruit being washed in a bar area, a hand basin did not have soap or drying facilities and the inside of ice machines in a kitchen were found to be dirty.

The inspector also found food was being kept on the floor of a walk-in freezer.

A ceiling and a vent were dirty and the club had not identified the risks of serving under-cooked burgers, the report, written in February, found.

Hygiene inspectors from Camden Council gave the club a zero-rating, with mouse excrement found around ovens, behind wheeled containers, between equipment and inside the vent section of an ice cream machine

The award-winning club, which made £16.8million profit last year, describes itself as a 'venue for some of London's most chic and exclusive events'

The award-winning club, which made £16.8million profit last year, describes itself as a 'venue for some of London's most chic and exclusive events'.

Members pay an annual subscription of £800 and enjoy 'exquisite food'.

Dave Stewart, best known for his work with Annie Lennox, is creative director of the club and Paul Allen, who founded Microsoft with Bill Gates and is one of the richest people on the planet, is the owner. 

Details of the zero-star rating - meaning urgent improvement was necessary - were released by Camden Council under the Freedom of Information Act.

A spokeswoman for the club said: 'The Hospital Club prides itself on the quality of its food offering and received food hygiene ratings of four in 2012 and five in 2013.

'We were disappointed to receive a reduced rating in 2014 and took immediate and significant remedial action to address all points as a matter of urgent priority.

'This was an isolated incident but nonetheless unacceptable according to our normally high quality we maintain throughout the club. 

'We are confident that our impending reassessment will again reflect the high standards we pride ourselves on and our members have come to expect.'
