Stepping down: Dr Anthony Marsh has said he will no longer head up two ambulance services at once

The controversial boss of two ambulance services has announced he is stepping down from one just 11 months into the job.

Dr Anthony Marsh was already chief executive of West Midlands Ambulance Service when he added the East of England region to his workload in January.

He has now said he will go as soon as a replacement can be found.

The decision came in the week that a harrowing internal report from the East of England ambulance service revealed paramedics were leaving bodies at ambulance stations to avoid finishing their shifts late.

It followed a series of outcries, firstly over his taxpayer-funded £232,000-a-year salary while effectively working part-time in both regions.

He was then found to be spending a five-figure sum each year on expenses for taxis and hotels.

In the meantime, he failed to drag response times in the East of England to expected national standards.

Tory MP Henry Bellingham yesterday accused both ambulance services of making a ‘mistake’ in allowing one person to run them.

‘What East of England Ambulance Service needs is a full-time, dedicated chief executive to move the service forward,’ he said.

‘It’s all about delivery and success and I don’t think he’s delivered. They were asking one person to do too much.’

Dr Marsh will no longer receive the £50,000 pay boost he was granted when he took over the dual role.

Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter described the remuneration package as ‘obscene’ when he was ‘only doing half a job for each ambulance service’.

It then emerged Dr Marsh was spending £350 a week on taxis, despite being handed a 2012 silver Range Rover Sport by the West Midlands service.

Officials explained he couldn’t drive himself as he needed to work during the three-hour journey to the East of England headquarters.

Instead, a Mercedes would pick him up at his home in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, and drive him to the site in Melbourn, Cambridgeshire.

He was also staying in hotels twice a week on average, costing more than £7,000 a year.

There was renewed outrage when the body of James Harrison, 32, who collapsed and died in a Cambridgeshire street, was left beside bins at an ambulance station because paramedics wanted to go home on time rather than take his body to a hospital morgue.

This week’s report revealed it remained there for two hours and spent so long unrefrigerated that police feared it would affect post-mortem examination tests.

Investigators also uncovered evidence crews were paying undertakers to do the job for them so that they wouldn’t overrun their shifts.

Other failures in the region include a 92-year-old Second World War bomber veteran who died from a bleed on the brain after waiting 90 minutes for an ambulance when he fell and hit his head.

The West Midlands service was fined £2.6 million in May for missing targets.

Meanwhile East of England – which has been paying 60 per cent of Dr Marsh’s salary - has continued to miss the targets for ambulance response times.

In November it managed to reach just 71.1 per cent of the most urgent Category A (Red 1) call-outs within eight minutes against the required 75 per cent.

A spokesman for East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust, which Dr Marsh had signed up to for a two-year period, said: ‘Long ambulance delays are significantly reduced, performance is improving, complaints are down and compliments are up, although we recognise there is still much work for us to do.’

The West Midlands service confirmed he would continue as its chief executive.
