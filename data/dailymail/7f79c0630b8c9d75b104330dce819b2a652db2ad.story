The Prime Minister may have been hoping for a Christmas miracle by parking himself in front a Christmas tree for his Canberra media conference on Monday in which he admitted that his government's performance had been 'a bit of a ragged one'.

In a one-hour long conference, he backed down on plans to cut allowances for Defence personnel as well as a proposal to increase student loan interest rates.

Mr Abbott also for the first time accepted that the decision made to cut the ABC budget by $250 million was 'at odds' with a pre-election commitment not to make any cuts the broadcaster.

In a stunning one-hour long media conference, Tony Abbott backed down on Defence allowances and accepted that the decision made to cut the ABC budget was 'at odds' with pre-election promises.

'Whatever faults this government has, no one can accuse us of lacking courage, no one can accuse us of cracking on with things,' he said.

'I'd be the first to admit that last week was a bit of ragged week for the government, I'd be the first to admit that,' he said.

'I do believe that by any reasonable measure this has been a year of very considerable achievement for the government.

'I know that appearances do count and I do concede that the appearance last week was a bit ragged - in the end nothing matters more than performance.'

On the ragged edge. 'I'd be the first to admit that last week was a bit of ragged week for the government, I'd be the first to admit that,' Tony Abbott said.

Mr Abbott did admit that the ABC budget cuts went against his election pledge.

'I respect the ABC's work even if I sometimes take issue with some of their judgements,' he said.

'I accept that what we're doing with the ABC is at odds immediately prior to the election but things have moved on, circumstances are different.'

He would not accept blame for the Victorian state election loss.

'People will speculate endlessly over whether federal factors had a role in a state election .. there were a whole range of factors at work here and I'm very satisfied we did what we could to play our part in the prosperity of Victoria,' Mr Abbott said.

As to whether the Budget is in more trouble now than at the start of 2014 he went on to say 'obviously when you've got all of our major commodity prices under pressure, there's less revenue coming into major businesses, obviously because of these cyclical factors there's pressure on the budget that wasn't there at the start of the year'.

As for his comments regarding the taking off of barnacles before Christmas, Mr Abbott said: 'It's very important that we crack on with budget repair .. plainly there are some things which are going to have a lot of difficulty in the Senate but if Plan A is in trouble obviously, you contemplate a potential Plan B.'

'Rather than having the best you've got to have something which is better but not as good as you would have wanted.'

He defended the imposing of higher income taxes, as a 'perfectly reasonable and fair thing to do' despite breaking another pre-election pledge. 

As for the Medicare co-payment, Tony Abbott said: 'I know that it well may have trouble in the cross-benches. We are committed until an alternative which makes sense.'

On the subject of the $7 Medicare Co-payment and its chances of getting through, the PM did not seem confident of its passage.

'There's been a ferocious campaign against it by the Labor Party,' Mr Abbott added.

'I know that it well may have trouble in the cross-benches. We are committed until an alternative which makes sense.' 

The federal leader earlier confirmed that he is abandoning plans to cut allowances for Defence personnel.

But Prime Minister Tony Abbott says the government isn't in a position to boost a below-inflation pay offer of 1.5 per cent a year for the next three years.

'All of us would like to see our defence forces paid more but what's possible with a $20 billion surplus is not always possible with a $40 billion deficit,' he said in Canberra on Monday.

'I think we just have to be realistic about defence force pay.'

The government has notified the independent Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal the changes to allowances are not supported by the government and asked that they be discontinued.

Restoring the allowances will mean discretionary leave, food and motor vehicle allowances will remain.

Mr Abbott says the decision will cost the Defence budget $17 billion.

'There won't be extra money put in so the CDF (chief of the defence force) will have to find the money,' he said.
