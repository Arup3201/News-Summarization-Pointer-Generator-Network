A naked man armed with a stick attempted to carjack three cars driving on a highway, before being chased down, tackled and secured with rope until police arrived.

Witnesses have told police the 26-year-old man ran out from a bush, smashing the windscreen of a moving ute and causing it flip on Brookton Highway in Karagullen, 40km southeast of Perth.

A man was found trapped in the capsized ute by another driver Phil Ferraro, who stopped to help the victim.

A naked man was tackled and hogtied, after he attempted to carjack three cars and allegedly assault a woman on a highway in Western Australia

Witnesses have told police the 26-year-old man ran out from a bush, smashing the windscreen of a moving ute, causing it flip on Brookton Highway in Karagullen, 40km southeast of Perth

Mr Ferraro said the attacker continued to harass other drivers, before allegedly carjacking and assaulting a woman who also had stopped to help.

'He tried to drag the girl out of her car and carjack her, ripping at her clothes and hair,' he told Nine News. 

The victim in the ute then called his brother and friend for help, while the armed man ran up and down the Brookton Highway stripping off his clothes.

He was eventually tackled to the ground, hogtied and held down until police arrived at the scene.

Mr Ferraro said the attacker was 'going crazy', as the men held him down in a ditch and used a rope to hogtie him.

The naked man was taken to Armadale Hospital and charged with 'endangering a life, health or safety of a person.

He will face court later this month.
