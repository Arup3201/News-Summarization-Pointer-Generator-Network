Public sector workers enjoy pensions that are worth 50 per cent more than the retirement payouts given to many private sector workers, a report said yesterday.

The authoritative finding challenges union claims that the pensions of state workers have been destroyed by the Government’s reforms.

The report, from the Pensions Policy Institute, a non-political research body, said there were ‘still significant differences between pensions in the public and private sectors’.

Better off: Despite numerous protests against public sector pension cuts, a new report has found that they still offer a better deal than most private sector pensions

Niki Cleal, a director of the 
institute, said: ‘Even after the Government’s proposed reforms, the 
average value of the pension benefit would remain more valuable than the
pensions which are most commonly available to employees in the private 
sector.’

The average public sector worker also 
earns a higher salary, works shorter hours and takes more sick days than
the average private sector employee.

Under the reforms, which are being 
introduced at the moment, state workers must work longer and contribute 
more to their pensions.

'Extremely generous' deal: Taxpayers Alliance chief executive Matthew Sinclair supports the proposed pension reforms

They have lost the link to their final
salary and their pensions will be based on career average salaries, but
their pensions remain gold-plated.

The institute said that typically, 
their pensions are worth 15 per cent of their salary. Before the 
reforms, they were worth 23 per cent.

By comparison, a typical private sector worker’s defined contribution pension is worth only 10 per cent of salary.

The institute said that if state 
workers were to be stripped of their pension rights they would need to 
get a 15 per cent average increase in their salary to make up for the 
loss.

Most private sector workers do not 
have a company pension scheme, with the number of members at its lowest 
level since records began in 1953. Only 2.9million of the 23.9million 
private sector workforce are in a company scheme.

For private sector workers who have a 
gold-plated final salary scheme, it is highly lucrative, typically worth
23 per cent of their salary, but the numbers have collapsed. Tom 
McPhail, head of pensions research at the financial advisers Hargreaves 
Lansdown, said state workers have suffered ‘some swingeing cuts’ to 
their benefits in recent years.

But he added: ‘They will still do very well relative to the typical private sector worker.’

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of 
the Taxpayers’ Alliance campaign group, said: ‘The vociferous opposition
to any reform of public sector pensions looks even more out of touch 
with reality given this independent assessment.

‘Even after necessary and moderate 
reform, public sector pensions will remain extremely generous, yet the 
unions still fight tooth and nail even the smallest of changes.

Well off: Nearly 9000 retired NHS workers are on pensions worth between £50,000 and £100,000 a year (posed by models)

‘It is absolutely right that those 
enjoying these premium deals should pay a fairer share of the cost of 
their retirement, especially as we are all living longer.’

The Government’s pensions tsar, Lord 
Hutton, the ex-Labour minister who was the architect of the reforms, 
said state workers’ pensions before the reforms were ‘not sustainable 
and fundamentally unfair’.

For example, 8,700 retired NHS staff in England and Wales enjoy a pension worth between £50,000 and £100,000 a year.

The institute’s report looked at the 
four big public sector schemes, which cover NHS workers, teachers, local
government staff and civil servants.
