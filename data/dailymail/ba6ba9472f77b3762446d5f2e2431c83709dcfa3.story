Lionel Messi achieved yet another milestone in his glittering career on Saturday night when he surpassed 400 career goals for club and country.

The Argentinian wizard scored twice in Barcelona's 6-0 thumping of Granada to take his overall goal tally to 401 - comprised of 359 for his club and 42 for his country.

'I never imagined I could achieve anything like this in my career,' the humble Messi wrote on his Facebook page afterwards. 'I'll continue working hard to reach more targets.'

Lionel Messi scored his 400th career goal in Barcelona's 6-0 win over Granada at the weekend and now has his sights set on breaking more records in both La Liga and the Champions League

Like so many in his glittering career, Messi's shot was simply unstoppable

1. Telmo Zarra (1940-1955) 251 goals in 278 games

2. Lionel Messi (2004-) 248 in 282

3. Hugo Sanchez (1981-1994) 234 in 347

4. Raul (1994-2010) 228 in 550

5. Alfredo di Stefano (1953-1966) 227 in 329

10. Cristiano Ronaldo (2009-) 187 in 170

Well, that's very convenient because the maestro is within striking distance of a whole host of other records. In fact, we could see them fall in the next couple of weeks.

Messi needs just four more to surpass Telmo Zarra, prolific Bilbao goal-getter of the Forties and Fifties, and become La Liga's all-time leading scorer.

Zarra scored 251 goals in 278 appearances between 1940 and 1955, while Messi has 248 in 282 - and counting.

Barcelona's next league match is at Rayo Vallecano on Saturday afternoon and the omens are pretty good - Messi has nine goals in six matches against them.

If he goes on a scoring spree, he will also move one closer to the league record for hat-tricks.

1. Raul (1995-2011) 71 goals

2. Cristiano Ronaldo (2002-) 69

3. Lionel Messi (2004-) 67

4. Ruud van Nistelrooy (1998-2009) 60

5. Andriy Shevchenko (1994-2011) 59

1. Alfredo di Stefano 22 hat-tricks

= Telmo Zarra 22

= Cristiano Ronaldo 22

4. Edmundo Suarez 19

5. Lionel Messi 18

Messi has scored three or more goals on 18 occasions in La Liga but he still trails Zarra, Alfredo di Stefano and Cristiano Ronaldo, all of whom have scored 22 trebles.

With rival Ronaldo showing no let up in his awesome scoring record, Messi will really have to up the pace to claim this particular accolade.

He is close to Zarra's record for scoring two or more in a La Liga game as well. Zarra did this on 76 occasions, Messi has done it on 72 so far.

With Barcelona travelling to take on Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday, Messi also has an opportunity to further close the gap on Real Madrid legend Raul as the European Cup's all-time top scorer.

Messi's Real Madrid rival Cristiano Ronaldo is competing for some of his records

Pele - 23

Gerd Muller - 26

Lionel Messi - 27

Ferenc Puskas, Cristiano Ronaldo - 28

Alfredo di Stefano - 29 

Messi has 67 in the competition, four shy of Raul. However, in between on 69 goals is Ronaldo and the next few years look like being a battle between the two to claim top spot.

Messi is also one goal shy of notching 200 goals at the Nou Camp but will have to wait until after the international break to try for this milestone.

Barcelona take on Eibar on October 21 and Messi will fancy his chances of getting on the scoresheet in that one.

It seems inevitable that we'll be celebrating yet more Messi milestones before the year is out.
