Fantasist: Stephen Webber, 41, was jailed for nine years after kidnapping model Laura Chapman, 26, by telling her he was an MI5 spy and she would be killed by a Russian hitman

A fantasist photographer who kidnapped a model by tricking her into believing he was an MI5 spy and she would be killed by a Russian hitman has been jailed for nine years.

Photographer Stephen Webber, 41, deceived Laura Chapman, 26, after she contacted him in a bid to further her modelling career.

He told her that she was going to be recruited by MI5 and a Russian hitman called 'Efjania' had been instructed to assassinate her.

Webber even claimed they had both been infected with a killer virus.

Miss Chapman was so terrified that she stayed with Webber for a week as they moved between various hotels along the south coast of England, sparking a huge police hunt.

As the lies became more unbelievable, she realised she was in a dangerous situation and wrote a 'goodbye' letter to her family.

They were eventually traced to Eastbourne, East Sussex, and her first words to officers were: 'Are you police? Am I safe?'.

Webber was convicted of kidnap, causing grievous bodily harm, making threats to kill and criminal damage at Hove Crown Court and jailed for nine years.

Richard Barton, prosecuting, described the case as 'kidnapping by fraud' and said Webber was 'intelligent and plausible'.

The court heard how Miss Chapman contacted Webber in July last year to discuss some modelling shots.

During the time she then modelled for him, over several months, he instilled a sense of paranoia in her.

Eventually, he told her she was going to be recruited by MI5 and made her watch the television programme Spooks about spies as the beginning of her 'training'.

Over the next six days, he took her to a string of hotels, telling her a series of increasingly elaborate lies.

Unable to escape and fearing for her life, Miss Chapman tried to keep Webber calm as she did not want him to hurt her.

Mr Barton said Webber twice stabbed Miss
Chapman, so she suffered scratches, tried to strangle her, pushed her 
and lied to her boyfriend and family.

Webber also frequently staged imaginary conversations on the phone with contacts at MI5.

'He talked about "shooting to kill",' said Mr Barton. 'He collapsed on the ground in shock on hearing that colleagues had been killed. She was terrified.

'He took her phone and bank card. He was in control.'

The pair were in Eastbourne discussing a plan to fake Miss Chapman's death and send the photographs to Efjania when they heard police sirens.

Mr Barton said Miss Chapman's first words were: 'Are you police? Am I safe? Why have you not found me until now? I have not slept for five days.'

After the sentencing, Detective Inspector Mick Jones said: 'Stephen Webber is clearly a dangerous individual whose deceit and manipulation led a vulnerable young woman into believing that he was a spy for MI5 and that they were both in life-threatening danger.

'This led to the victim being too frightened to leave him over a five-day period in which they travelled to Eastbourne, staying in local accommodation whilst their alleged pursuers hunted for them.

'The victim was so fearful of the situation presented by Webber that she was too afraid to attempt to escape.'
