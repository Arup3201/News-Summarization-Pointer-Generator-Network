An Occupy Wall Street protester who was convicted earlier this month of assaulting a police officer sobbed in court today because prison guards at Riker's Island brought her the wrong outfit to wear.

Cecily McMillan was sentenced to three months' jail in mid May after her May 5 conviction. The 26-year-old appeared in court on a separate charge Wednesday and broke down in front of Manhattan Criminal Court judge Ann Scherzer over her clothing.

'She wasn't happy with the clothing she was given,' her defense lawyer Martin Stolar said, according to the New York Post. 'And she wanted to be uncuffed.'

The activist faces charges for claiming she was a lawyer and telling two men accused of fare-beating not to cooperate with a police officer in December.

She was dressed in a white dress and beige blazer - almost identical outfit to one she sported when jurors handed down their guilty verdict on May 5. It's not clear if this is the reason she was unhappy with the outfit choice.

Prosecutors offered McMillan a no​-​jail plea deal of community service and anger management if she confessed to the misdemeanor charge. Stolar said he and his client would consider it and added that the student was struggling in prison.

'It's not a very good place to be,' he said. 'She's not happy just like every other inmate.'

McMillan became a cause celebre for 
activists after she was charged with assaulting a police officer was 
sentenced to 90 days in jail, with a judge saying a protest is no excuse
 for an attack.

McMillan apologized for injuring the officer but defiantly proclaimed her innocence as she was sentenced on one of the few felony convictions resulting from the New York protests. She could have been sent to prison for seven years.

'I have been exhausted of almost everything that makes me me, with one key exception: my dignity,' said the 25-year-old graduate student, jailed since the May 5 verdict in a case that she said showed 'the personal is inseparable from the political.'

Prosecutors said McMillan baldly hit an officer in the face, misrepresented what happened and used her trial as 'a grandstand for her political opinions,' as Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Shanda Strain put it.

McMillan was arrested as activists observed the Occupy's six-month mark on March 17, 2012. Police were clearing people from the movement's former home base at Zuccotti Park.

Prosecutors pointed to video showing 
McMillan elbowing an officer in the eye as he walked behind her, 
ushering her along. She said she reacted out of alarm after her breast 
was grabbed from behind, which the officer denied doing and isn't clear 
in the video. She said police then roughed her up while arresting her as
 she suffered what she believed was a seizure.

McMillan's case became a rallying point for Occupiers, and members of the once-jailed Russian punk group Pussy Riot have visited her behind bars.

Director Spike Jonze, Sonic Youth bassist Kim Gordon, some City Council members and even several of the jurors who convicted her wrote to the court asking for leniency. More than 171,000 people signed an online petition.

For all that, 'a civil society must not allow an assault to be committed under the guise of civil disobedience,' Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Ronald Zweibel said. 'Ms. McMillan must take responsibility for her conduct.'

McMillan's supporters overflowed the courtroom at her sentencing, singing 'We Shall Not Be Moved,' a folk song recorded by Pete Seeger and long a protest staple, as they filed out afterward.

More than 30 court officers lined the courtroom as well, an unusual show of crowd control that came after some spectators shouted 'Shame!' when she was convicted.

McMillan's lawyer, Martin Stolar, said she plans to appeal the verdict and ask for bail while the appeal plays out.
