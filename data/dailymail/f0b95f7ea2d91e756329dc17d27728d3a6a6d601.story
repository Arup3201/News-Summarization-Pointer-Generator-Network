Griff Rhys Jones, 60, says he will consider moving abroad if Labour introduces a mansion tax

Griff Rhys Jones has said he is thinking about moving abroad if Labour wins the election and introduce a mansion tax.

The TV star described the idea of a levy on properties worth more than £2million as ‘fatuous’.

Under Labour’s proposals, owners of homes worth between £2million and £3million would pay £3,000 a year extra in tax.

Owners of homes worth more than £3million could pay as much as £30,000 extra per year.

Rhys Jones, 60, who made his name in shows such as Alas Smith and Jones alongside comedian Mel Smith, told the Daily Telegraph: ‘It would mean I’d be paying the most colossal tax, which is obviously aimed at foreigners who have apparently come in and bought up all the property in London.’

He added: ‘That sounds about as fatuous an idea as that immigrants are stealing all the jobs. I’d probably go and live abroad because I could get some massive palace which I could restore there.’

The presenter lives in a ‘gigantic’ house in Fitzrovia, central London, which he described as being a ‘slum’ when he bought it 15 years ago.

He said it has appreciated so significantly in value that he may move overseas if Labour wins next May’s election.

He is not the first wealthy celebrity to raise concerns about the proposed tax. Last month former England footballer Sol Campbell, 40, called the tax a ‘cheap and easy way to extract money from individuals who have done well’.

It later emerged that the player had put his six-bedroom London home on the market for £25million.

Rhys Jones made his fortune from founding production company Talkback Productions with Mel Smith. It now makes hit shows including The Apprentice and Never Mind The Buzzcocks.

The Cardiff-born comedian has a track record of buying run-down properties and redeveloping them.

He added: ‘I mustn’t equate my own personal angst about the mansion tax with a national policy angst. No way. It’s quite likely that the population is very keen on seeing rich people squeal. So I’m not going to squeal to make them feel better.’

The mansion tax proposal has also been criticised by Legal and General chief Nigel Wilson, who said it would punish savers who worked hard to own their own home.

Around 90 per cent of affected homes are in the capital and Mr Wilson says the tax would be ‘anti-London’.

Last week he said Labour was ‘pandering to the politics of envy’.

He fears that Ed Miliband’s pledge to impose a tax on homes worth more than £2 million would exacerbate the housing shortage and make it hard for first-time buyers to get a foot on the property ladder.

The top end of the property market has already slowed due to the threat of a levy and the drop in sales could reduce the amount of houses being built, he added.
