Created especially for the festive season, it's meant to taste like no other cocktail around and smells exactly like Christmas in a cup. 

The Mincemeat Irish contains Irish cream liqueur, cognac, milk and traditional mincemeat - with the classic Xmas flavour of a clementine.

Created by Sainbury's and London Cocktail Club's JJ Goodman, the cocktail recipe is for mince-pie obsessed Brits - and was made after the supermarket revealed it has sold more that eight million mince pies since September.

The mincemeat cocktail has Irish Cream, Cognac,  fruit mincemeat, whole milk and one whole clementine

Sainsbury's Head of Product Development Susi Richards said: 'Our delicious mincemeat cocktail recipe was designed especially for our mince pie mad customers so they can enjoy the flavours of mincemeat in a really different way.

'It's a fantastic, fun way to entertain friends and a great way of ensuring you don't end up with a half empty jar of mincemeat in the cupboard at the end of Christmas.

The ingredients in the humble Christmas staple have been elevated to cocktail status with the new creation

The supermarket giant teamed up with London Cocktail Club to create the festive concoction

Ingredients:  50ml Irish Cream, 25ml  Cognac, two teaspoons of fruit mincemeat, 25ml whole milk one whole clementine

Method

1. Apart from the clementine, add all of the ingredients to a cocktail shaker filled with ice.

2. Shake vigorously for ten seconds to allow for some of the dilution and to properly chill the drink. 

3. Then strain the cocktail into a martini glass or a short glass filled with cubed ice.

4. Take a clementine and a potato peeler, zest a strip of peel 3cm wide and 6cm long. 

5. Twist the peel over the glass orange side down to spray the oils over the drink, which will give you an amazing smell as you sip.
