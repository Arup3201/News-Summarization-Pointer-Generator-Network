A beloved Aspen socialite who was murdered in her chalet last week was previously engaged to actor Michael Douglas, it has emerged.

Nancy Pfister, 57, was found dead in a cupboard in her home on February 26, 
just four days after she was forced to return from an extended trip to Australia
 following trouble with her tenants.

On Monday, William Francis Styler II, 65, and his wife Nancy, 62, who had rented Pfister's property while she was abroad, were arrested on suspicion of her murder and appeared in court on Tuesday.

The murder - the first in Pitkin County, Colorado in more than a decade - has rocked the small ski resort town, where residents said Pfister had been a popular, well-connected resident.

Murdered: Socialite Nancy Pfister, left, was found killed in her Aspen chalet last week. It has emerged that she was previously engaged to actor Michael Douglas, pictured right in Aspen in 1990

'She'd been one of the golden girls of Aspen, seriously into the party scene [in her youth],' a source told Page Six. 'She hung out with the Kennedys, Jack Nicholson, Cher, Michael Douglas.'

The source added that Pfister was even once briefly engaged to Douglas.

The revelations come as Pfister's daughter said she refuses to accept her mother could have been killed over a tenant dispute - and apparently further evidence that the couple had money troubles.

Ahead of her return from Aspen, Pfister had written on Facebook: 'I'd like to stay in Australia but the 
people that were supposedly taking care of my house are not doing what 
they said they would do and they're not paying rent and they haven't 
paid utilities.'

Her daughter Juliana asked: 'How could someone just be so angry that they got kicked out of a house? There’s got to be something more. It's hard to understand that', ABC News reported.

Locked up: Styler - who had been suffering various illnesses before his arrest -and his wife are being held without bond

Styler, a former physician, was taken by wheelchair to a bond hearing before a Pitkin County District Court judge on Tuesday. His wife, who displayed manicured nails, was also present.

Juliana Pfister sat behind the suspects during the hearing, where the judge ordered the couple to be held without bond for the time being, ABC reported.

As the couple apparently fell behind on rent payments last year, court documents show Styler was battling to collect a debt of $800,00 from a lawyer he accused of overcharging him.

In 2003, Styler had taken his previous company, Colorado Anesthesia Consultants, to court in a dispute over software Styler had co-created, but he lost the case.

He accused his lawyer John Powell for overcharging him for legal services for the case - and in 2010, Styler sued Powell for the debt, the Aspen Times reported.

But Powell - who was put on probation for overcharging Styler and another client - filed for bankruptcy, protecting him from having to pay the debt.

The report in the Aspen Times says that the scandal led Styler to express suicidal thoughts, including telling an attorney that he wanted to commit 'suicide by cop'.

As recently as November last year, William Styler had written to the court’s Attorney Regulation Counsel about his frustrations in collecting money from the lawyer - the same time he was renting the property from Pfister.

Their couple, who both face charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, will next appear in court on March 17.

At a news conference following the couple's arrests on Monday, Sheriff Joe DiSalvo declined to identify how Pfister was killed and would not say what evidence had led them to arrest the couple.

He added that the investigation is ongoing and that authorities have not yet ruled out the possibility of more arrests, the Aspen Times reported.

Missed: Pfister, pictured with her daughter, wrote on Facebook that she was returning early from Australia as she was having trouble with tenants who were not paying the rent or bills

Heartbroken: Pfister's daughter Juliana said that had to be something more to her mother's death

The autopsy report is not complete and all records in the
 case have been sealed.

Nancy Pfister's death is the first known homicide in Pitkin County since October 2001.

'This case has been hard from the 
beginning on all of us, because of the nature of it,' the sheriff said. 'First-degree murders don’t happen here too often. That’s good. When 
they do, we take it very seriously, and we storm it. We throw everything
 we've got at it.'

Her daughter Juliana added that her mother had been a beloved member of the community.

'I have no idea how someone could do something like that and especially to her and I think that, you know, my mom could never hurt anything or hurt anyone and that is one thing that everyone that knew her knew,' Pfister said. 'She cared about a lot of people and helped the wrong people this time.'

Sheriff DiSalvo: 'I loved Nancy - she was a good person.'

'Friendly': Styler is seen left (with a friend) at a party Pfister threw in Nover before she went abroad

Arrest: Styler, a physician, was still in his bathrobe when he was arrested at his Colorado motel room

Caught: The couple were arrested five days after their alleged victim's body was found

Scene: Pfister was found dead in her home, pictured, which she had rented to the Stylers while she traveled

The Aspen Times reported that Pfister was the daughter of Art and Betty Pfister, a prominent local couple who played a major role in the development of the ski resorts. Both preceded their daughter in death.

The Stylers, who are believed to have one adult son, were first questioned by investigators the day after Pfister's body was found and on Monday they were taken to the Pitkin County Jail.

Public records show that Mr Styler is a physician who graduated from the Oklahoma State University College Of Osteopathic Medicine in 1979, but his credentials expired in 2005.
