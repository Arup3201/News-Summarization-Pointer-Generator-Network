Foxes and hounds are supposed to be sworn enemies, divided by years of hunting history.

But nobody told these two creatures, who have been getting on like a house on fire since they started living under the same roof.

Like a real-life version of the animals in Disney cartoon The Fox and the Hound, they became best of friends after both being adopted by a family in Cornwall.

Best of friends: Fox cub Forrest and family pet Barney have become close pals after they were both adopted by Gary Zammit, a wildlife ranger at Feadon Farm near Redruth, Cornwall

Cartoon: Their story mirrors that of The Fox and the Hound, where fox Tod and hound Copper become friends

Fox cub Forrest was taken under the wing of Gary Zammit, a wildlife ranger at Feadon Farm near Redruth, Cornwall, after he was found lost in a puddle earlier this year.

A touch of rivalry might have been expected between the young fox and the family's pet dog, Barney, but the pair have become the best of friends.

Mr Zammit said: 'It really was love at first sight with them both. Barney is so 
gentle with him and they play for hours and hours. They are exhausting 
to watch.'

Both the animals were adopted by the family after being found seemingly abandoned, and, amazingly, both are missing their tails.

Mr Zammit added: 'I think they might be kindred spirits - even without tails to wag you can tell they are happiest when they are together.

'It’s
 excellent news as Forrest will never be able to go into the wild now. 
We plan to give him a home here at the farm with our other foxes.

'The more time he spends with Barney and with us at home the easier it will be for him to fit in.'

The fox cub's lack of tail led staff at Penmellyn Vets in St Columb Major, Cornwall, to give him his name, 'Forrest Stump'.

Commenting on hiow he was found, Mr Zammit added: 'He was 
in an awful state when they found him and it was touch and go for a long
 time.

'A fox this young can go downhill very quickly, so he needed round
 the clock care. It’s a bit like having a new born with night time feeds and constant attention.'

The pair are now popular with visitors to the neighbouring Gwel an Mor resort, which runs wildlife activities for tourists.

The story almost perfectly mirrors that of 1981 film The Fox and The Hound, in which a young fox is adopted by a family and befriends a neighbour's dog.

Ouch: Forrest - who like Barney was found missing his tail - nips at the much bigger dog as they play

Saved: Forrest was found sitting in a puddle by a tourist and taken to a local vets, where he was looked after
