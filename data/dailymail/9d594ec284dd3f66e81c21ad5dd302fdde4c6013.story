Jason Kidd was charged $50,000 by the NBA for spilling his
soda on the court at the Barclay’s Center in New York on Wednesday night, and
it wasn’t a fine for being clumsy.

The Brooklyn Nets coach was believed to have
spilled his drink intentionally to buy his team more time in a game against the
LA Lakers.

Video footage of the event shows Kidd mouthing words which appear
to be, ‘hit me.’ Following coach's orders, Nets player Tyshawn Taylor chest bumps his coach and the
soda spills out all over the court. 

Gothamist reports that Kidd insists his sweaty palms were to
blame for the spill that occurred in the last 8.3 seconds of the game . The
Nets were down 94 to 99 and there were no more time-outs.

The New York Post reports that Lakers Guard Jodie Meeks made
two free throws with only 8.2 seconds in the game and Kidd wanted to get his
team a time-out to increase his team's chances of winning.

As court attendants scrambled to clean the mess, assistant Nets coach John Welch drew out a final play for the team who wouldn't otherwise have had a break to discuss the next play.

‘The cup slipped out of my hand when I was getting Ty [out
of the game],’Kidd said.

The New York Post reported that Taylor defended his coach by
saying, ‘I didn’t even know he was holding nothing, though,’

‘Coach is drinking a soda on the sideline. … I was like,
‘What’s he doing?,’Taylor continued.

Kidd looked down at the soda drenched court and appears to
say, ‘aw jeez.’ The Nets lost the game anyway.

Gothamist reports that Jason Kidd denies any foul play and
said that when he was a player he was clumsy and ‘never good with the ball.’ He happened
to be one of the best point guards in NBA history which doesn’t back up his
claim.

According to The Post, This isn’t the first time Kidd has
used a trick on the sidelines in attempt to change a game in his favor.

When
he was a player for the Dallas Mavericks , he bumped into the Hawks coach Mike
Woodson while he was on the court. This created a technical foul and the Mavericks
eventually won the game.

No Kidd-ing: Video footage of Kidd saying 'hit me' led the NBA to believe the spill was foul play and they charged him a 50,000 fine
