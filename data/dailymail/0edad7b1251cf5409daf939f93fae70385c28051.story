Samsung warned earlier this month it was bracing itself for a drop in profit, but its latest earnings release reveals the dip may have been worse than expected.

The South Korean firm announced its net income between April and June dropped 20 per cent - to 6.3 trillion won (£3.6 billion), down from 7.8 trillion won (£4.3 billion) - compared to the same time last year.

There was also a 15 per cent drop in income compared to the first quarter of this year, sales fell 9 per cent, and operating profit sank 25 per cent.

The company particularly struggled to compete in cheap smartphones, and Samsung shares dived 4 per cent following the announcement in Seoul.

The South Korean firm announced its net income between April and June dropped 20 per cent - to 6.3 trillion won (£3.6 billion) down from 7.8 trillion won (£4.3 billion) - compared to the same time last year.

There was also a 15 per cent drop in income compared to the first quarter of this year, sales fell 9 per cent, and operating profit sank 25 per cent.

Samsung sold 95 million mobile handsets in the quarter and smartphones were close to 80 per cent of those sales.

By comparison, it sold 8 million tablet PCs.

Samsung is still the world's largest supplier of smartphones, but its global market share fell to 25 per cent from 32 per cent. 

Research firm IDC estimated Samsung shipped 74.3 million smartphones during the second quarter, down 4 per cent from a year earlier, despite the overall smartphone market expanding 23 per cent. 

That was the lowest since the second quarter of 2012.

This yearly drop was despite the launch of Samsung's new Gear range of smartwatches, and the Galaxy S5 in February.

Samsung released a statement at the start of July claiming the second quarter would be its worst in two years, and blamed it on fading smartphone sales.

Robert Yi, head of investor relations, told a conference call that Samsung had higher marketing expenses as competition increased in mid- to low-end smartphones, and because it tried to clear old inventory before the release of updated smartphone models in the fall.

Tablet computer sales also fell, he said, citing weak overall demand.

Samsung sold 95 million mobile handsets in the quarter, and smartphones made close to 80 per cent of those sales, Yi continued.

By comparison, the firm sold 8 million tablet PCs.

This global dip in tablet popularity was also recently seen in Apple’s earnings after the company posted a 9 per cent drop in iPad sales.

Chinese vendors, Huawei and Lenovo, were the companies that drove growth in global smartphone sales.

Samsung is still the world's largest supplier of smartphones but its global market share fell to 25 per cent from 32 per cent. 

Analysts said Samsung struggled in developing nations as consumers using handsets powered by Android were more willing to try devices from other brands.

Smartphones have become ubiquitous in developed markets and are becoming so in emerging markets, making it harder to find people who are buying a smartphone for the first time, said Melissa Chau, senior research manager at IDC, a market research firm.

‘Just staying on Android is not going to keep you in one brand.’

That would make it more important for Samsung to develop unique services for its Galaxy phone users or to push use of its own software that does not rely on Google's Android.

After a nine months at the top of the charts, the iPhone 5S has been knocked off the top spot by cheaper Apple model, the iPhone 5C.

That's according to the uSwitch.com Mobile Tracker, which is based on live searches, pre-orders and sales.

Samsung’s Galaxy S5 remained in third place during July. 

The older Galaxy S4 slipped a place to fifth, allowing the iPhone 4S to move up a position. 

Samsung has stumbled in its efforts to make even a small move away from Android.

Earlier this week, it delayed the release of the first smartphone powered by Tizen, its own mobile operating system, just two months after announcing a launch date. It did not give a future schedule.

For the third quarter, Samsung forecast it would sell more handsets as there is usually higher demand for consumer electronics during that period. But it would also face higher competition.

Apple is expected to release a new iPhone with a larger screen – a key feature in Galaxy phones that helped Samsung lure consumers from the iPhone in the first place.

‘Looking ahead, the second half of 2014 will remain a challenge,’ Samsung said in a statement.

In the previous years, Samsung released one high-end model during the third quarter. But this year, Samsung hinted that there will be one additional high-end model.

Kim Hyunjoon, senior vice president at Samsung's mobile business, told the conference call that several new handset models are in the pipeline for launch in the next few months.

They include a new flagship model in the large-screen category and another premium phone with new design and materials.

Kim did not elaborate what the new materials would be.
