After the Twitter skirmish that turned into a war of words, Mo Farah let his running speak for itself in Birmingham on Saturday as the double Olympic champion smashed the indoor world record over two miles at the Sainsbury's Grand Prix.

Having landed every major title, the 31-year-old finally claimed a global mark. 'It's difficult to train for a world record and then to train for a championship,' he said after setting a time of 8:03.40. 'It's always been hard, but at some point, I wanted to see what I could do.'

His well-wishers had included Andy Vernon, who earned Farah's fury for a joke gone wrong and aspersions cast over the strength of the field here. The off-track distractions lifted Farah on it and he ground out a solo pursuit when his challengers faded away, finishing more than 10 seconds clear of Kenya's Paul Koech.

'It inspired me,' he said. 'Whatever has happened has happened, we've got to move on. But at the same time I'm an athlete, that's what I do best. I just have to keep on running.'

A training stint in Kenya has set him up nicely for a summer where retaining his world 5,000 and 10,000 metres titles will be the priority.

Others in Birmingham were preparing for the European Indoor Championships in Prague on March 6.

Katarina Johnson-Thompson illustrated why she will be favourite for pentathlon gold by claiming her second UK record in a week by following up her high jump mark with a new long jump best of 6.93m.

World No 1 Jenny Meadows kept up her winning run in the 800m while Olympic champion Greg Rutherford set an indoor long jump PB of 8.17m.
