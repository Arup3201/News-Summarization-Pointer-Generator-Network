Romania's population has fallen by more than 12 per cent since 2002 as hundreds of thousands leave the poverty-stricken nation for richer countries such as Britain.

Figures from the latest Romanian census reveal that migration and a low birth rate have pushed the population down to 19million, a fall of almost 3million in ten years.

The country’s National Statistics Board said nearly 1million Romanians were working abroad.

However, other estimates suggest the number of expatriate workers could be 3million.

There is no official figure for the 
number of Romanians in the UK, but British bosses advertised 2,400 
vacancies last month alone on a Romanian website for nurses, engineers 
and other jobs.

Unemployment in Britain is at 8.4 per 
cent, but many firms seek staff from impoverished nations such as 
Romania – the second-poorest in the EU after Bulgaria – to work for low 
wages.

Although Romania joined the EU in 2007, its citizens still need permission from the UK Border Agency to work here.

Romania is being bailed out by the 
International Monetary Fund and has imposed austerity measures. Its 
falling population will further hit tax revenues.

The figures raised concerns about the size of the country's work force and tax income. It is also being hit by a low birth rate.

The data comes after a Romanian Big Issue seller in Britain was revealed to be claiming generous state handouts.

Firuta
 Vasile, a mother of four who sold the magazine in Bristol, was given 
the legal right to claim  housing benefit on top of the other aid she 
already receives.

An 
investigation revealed that large numbers of Romanians are working in 
the UK as Big Issue vendors whilst also claiming benefits.

Almost
 one in three Big Issue sellers – 700 out of a nationwide force of 2,250
 registered vendors according to the magazine – were found to have come 
from Romania. 

Immigration officers swoop on an illegal Roma camp in Ireland. There are as many as 2.5 million of the minority group in Romania, although the exact figure is unknown

The benefits loophole is just one example of the more prosperous life that Romanian immigrants are able to lead in Britain.

The exit of workers has raised 
particular concerns in a country where only about 5 million employees 
pay taxes and most of the rest are pensioners, children, subsistence 
farmers or people working illegally.

Romania's over-sized and inefficient state sector accounts for nearly a quarter of employees.  

'The
 foreign migration balance is the main reason for the decline in 
Romania's population, coupled with a negative natural growth,' said Ilie
 Dumitrescu, spokeman for the National Statistics Board.

Romania's government has pushed through tough austerity measures, cutting salaries and raising sales tax to bring its budget cap under control and maintain an International Monetary Fund bailout.     

The fall in population will make it harder to increase revenue collection.       

Hungarians make up 6.5 per cent of the population and 3.2 per cent, or 619,000, described themselves as Roma.    

Rights group say many Roma do not declare their background, some of them fearing discrimination, and the true number could be as high as 2.5 million. That would be the largest Roma community in Europe.      

The statistics office estimates about a million people were not included in the data because they did not complete the forms or are living abroad and were not declared by relatives.     

Dumitrescu said the agency would release more detailed data in late May and there could still be some significant changes to the figures.

In a photograph of Romanians outside the British Embassy a caption had originally said that 'many [Romanian] natives seek visas which will give them entry to the UK'. We are happy to make clear that as Romania is part of the EU, its nationals do not require a visa to enter, reside or be self-employed in UK, however, workers seeking to be employed need permission from UK Border Control.
