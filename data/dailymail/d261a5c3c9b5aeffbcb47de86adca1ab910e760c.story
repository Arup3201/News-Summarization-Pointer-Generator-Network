The parents of the missing 10-month-old Kansas City girl, Lisa Irwin, who went missing on Monday night have made a tearful plea to her abductor to drop her 'somewhere safe so she can come home'.

Jeremy Irwin and Deborah Bradley spoke during a brief news conference held at a makeshift police command centre half a mile from their home appealing to the public to call police with any information.

Speaking to the media for the first time
since her daughter Lisa was snatched from her crib by an intruder, 
Bradley clutching a purple Barney doll, presumably belonging to her 
daughter, tearfully begged for child’s return saying: 'We just want our 
baby back.'

Police have conducted a search of the abduction scene and do not have 
any doubts about the parents’ story, and police have said they are not 
suspects in the case.

Firemen used ropes to search a 100ft embankment, officers combed nearby 
railroad tracks and canines were sent into the woods, police said.

Lisa Irwin, who weighs just 26lbs and is 30 inches long, was last seen 
on Monday night after her parents put her to bed.  Lisa was wearing 
purple shorts and a purple shirt with white kittens on it when she was 
put to bed.

She is blonde with blue eyes and has two bottom teeth, a small bug bite 
under her left ear and a beauty mark on her right outer thigh.

A neighbour remembered a person walking down the road in the dark with a baby in a nappy, Captain Steve Young told ABC News.

Police have now cancelled an ‘Amber Alert’ for Lisa, which lets the 
public know about a missing minor at risk of serious injury or death.

The immediate alert is no longer needed, but the investigation continues
and the search will restart on Wednesday morning, reported ABC.

‘I've lived here for over 50 years and this is probably the first time 
I've seen any crime here,’ neighbour Charles Rusher told ABC News.

Hunt: Emergency services have conducted a massive search for the missing toddler

Abducted: Police say whoever took Lisa came in through her bedroom window

Searching: Kansas City police combed the area near Lisa's house Tuesday morning, hoping to find clues to where the missing infant is
