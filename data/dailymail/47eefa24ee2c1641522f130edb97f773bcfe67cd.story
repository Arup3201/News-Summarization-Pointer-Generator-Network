Questioned: Stephen McLaughlin, 34, was quizzed for at least four days over the death of an Afghan Sikh found crammed inside a container that had come from Belgium to Tilbury Docks

The trucker being questioned by police over the death of an Afghan stowaway was held as he drove home to his family.

Detectives stopped Stephen McLaughlin’s blue Volvo lorry on Tuesday near the bungalow in Northern Ireland he shares with partner Ann-Marie Harkin, 32, and their four young children, it was revealed last night.

Yesterday Mr McLaughlin, 34, was still being questioned on suspicion of manslaughter and people trafficking after a man suffocated to death in a container at Tilbury Docks in Essex on Saturday.

Meet Singh Kapoor, 40, was one of 35 Afghan Sikhs – including 13 children – found crammed inside the container, which had just arrived from Belgium.

Mr McLaughlin, from Limavady, near Londonderry was flown to Essex for questioning on Wednesday night.

A second man, aged 33 and from Londonderry, was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and people smuggling after he went to a police station in Essex on Wednesday afternoon. Last night both men remained in custody.

Detectives from the Police Service of Northern Ireland have searched Mr McLaughlin’s home.

Miss Harkin, 32, who gave birth to their youngest child, a boy, only six weeks ago, declined to comment on her partner’s arrest. Neighbours in Limavady described Mr McLaughlin as a ‘friendly family man’.

Essex Police have released more details of the conditions in the container in which Mr Kapoor suffocated in front of his family as the group of migrants aged one to 72 tried desperately to enter Britain.

With too little room to stand, the families had to perch on top of large containers of chemicals surrounded by what little luggage they could carry.

The stowaways were locked inside without light and proper ventilation for a harrowing 18 hours, struggling to breathe the air let in by one tiny hole in the container.

They had barely enough room to move and nowhere to relieve themselves. 

They were rescued at about 6.30am on Saturday when staff heard screaming and banging coming from the 40ft container, labelled Hudig & Kersten, which had arrived on a P&O freight ferry from Zeebrugge. 

Belgian police believe the immigrants were already inside when it was delivered to the Belgian port.

Father-of-two Mr Kapoor was declared dead at the scene. The others were treated at the scene and at local hospitals for severe dehydration and hypothermia.

After being freed, the survivors said that they feared they were 20 minutes from death and were drifting in and out of consciousness.

Crammed: Meet Singh Kapoor, 40, was one of 35 Afghan Sikhs, including 13 children, found inside the container

The group were from the tiny Sikh minority left in Afghanistan.

They are believed to have fled the country six months ago to escape further persecution.

Kamaljit Singh Matharu, who has been acting as a translator for the group, said: ‘The immigrants have been through a lot, they are traumatised. They are still very frightened and confused.’

One of the immigrants, a man in his 30s, told the Daily Mail that the survivors were struggling to piece together their harrowing journey.
