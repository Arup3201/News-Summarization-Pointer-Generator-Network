The fastest Ferrari ever was unveiled today – with a blistering price to match.

The new Ferrari F12 Berlinetta  has a top speed of 212miles per hour but it’s the rocket like acceleration which is drawing gasps ahead of its official launch at next week’s Geneva Motor Show when it goes on sale.

The scintillating two-seater roars from rest to 62mph in just  3.1 seconds – shaving 0.6 seconds off the car it replaces, the Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano. And the Italian supercar will hit 124mph  in just 8.5 seconds, compared to 11 seconds for its predecessor.

Start saving: The new Ferrari F12 Berlinetta costs £250,000

Top Gear: The new F12 has a top speed of 212miles per hour

Top speed of 212mph is also faster than the 599’s 205mph.Ferrari said boldly: ‘This is the fastest Ferrari ever built.’

But that sort of performance also commands a  powerful price – with the production cars costing £250,000.

The new car is powered by a vast 6.3 litre V12 naturally aspirated direct injection engine which develops 740 horsepower – more than seven Fiord Fiestas.

It is available with a super-slock 7-speed Grand Prix style automatic dual clutch  gearbox with a manual override via F1-style paddles on the steering wheel.

Wheel of fortune: The F12 steering wheel has Formula One paddles

Luxury: The interior design of the F12 is a result of the legendary Italian styling house Pininfarina

The new car is  finished in a new Ferrari red  ‘Rosso Berlinetta’ three-layer colour.

Only the Ferrari Enzo of 2002 which sold originally for £365,000 but can now command up to £1m  has a faster absolute speed – of 217.5mph, But it could not accelerate as fast as the new car. By comparison, the Enzo could manage 0 to 62mph in ‘only’ 3.65 seconds.

Ferrari said of the new F12 Berlinetta supercar: ‘This is, in fact, the most powerful and high-performance Ferrari road car ever launched thanks to the incredibly efficient engine.’‘Together with advanced vehicle architecture, aerodynamics, components and electronic controls, guarantee unsurpassed driving involvement whatever the road or track.’

The new car is also lighter than the one it replaces: ‘The overall result is a very compact car with a lower centre of gravity that is further back in the chassis, and a level of aerodynamic efficiency that sets new standards.’

The F12 is powered by a 6.3 engine which develops 740 horsepower – more than seven Fiord Fiestas

The bodyshell uses 12 different kinds of alloys and weighs 1.525 tonnes

The new supercar’s lightweight space-frame chassis and bodyshell uses 12 different kinds of alloys and uses new assembly and joining techniques which makes the car 20 per cent ‘stiffer.’

At 1.525 tonnes it is also 70 kg less than the previous V12 coupé.

Fuel consumption has been reduced by 30 per cent , with CO2 emissions down from 415g/km to  ‘just’ 350 g/km.

But Ferrari says these figures put the F12 Berlinetta ‘at the top of the high-performance league.’

These results have been obtained by extensive research and development which focused on efficiencies of the whole vehicle: engine, aerodynamics, tyres and weights.

Aerodynamics play a huge part in the car’s  improved performance.

Out with the old: The Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano which cost an estimated £170,00 has been eclipsed by the new F12 model

Drag resistance has been significantly reduced by use of what the Italian car firm calls an ‘Aero Bridge.’ This uses the bonnet to generate downforce by channelling air away from the upper part of the car to its flanks.

A second Active Brake Cooling, a system that opens  flaps to the brake cooling ducts only when the pads get hot.

The result is that the new ‘Prancing Horse’  12-cylinder also completes a lap of the famous  Fiorano race-test circuit in 1 minute and 23 seconds - faster than any other Ferrari road car.

Stopping distances have also been drastically reduced, says Ferrari.

The design of the F12 Berlinetta  is a result of the collaboration between the Ferrari Styling Centre and legendary Italian styling house Pininfarina.

Spot the difference: The tatty 1961 Ferrari 250 GTE was recently put up for sale and is expected to sell for £60,000

The Gran Turismo car was Ferrari's first four-seater. Moving the engine, gearbox and steering gear forward and the fuel tank back left sufficient room for two occasional rear seats

Ferrari said: It is a perfect balance of uncompromising aerodynamics with harmonious proportions.’

Inside, Ferrari says:  ’The cockpit is designed around the driver. ‘

But both driver and passenger is cossetted  in an all-new ‘Frau’ leather interior showcasing  both the car’s advanced technology and sophisticated, handcrafted detailing.

In the middle of the light and lean dashboard, there are new carbon fibre and aluminium air vents clearly inspired by the aeronautic field.

For couples heading off for a romantic weekend in Tuscany, additional luggage capacity behind the seats, which can also be easily reached via a large aperture offered by the tail-gate.
