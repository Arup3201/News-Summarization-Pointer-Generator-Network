A man is fighting for his life after being shot by police responding to a domestic abuse call.

Gerald Cole, 54, of San Angelo, was listed in critical condition yesterday following the incident in which he suffered at least one gunshot wound.

According to the San Angelo Standard Times, police say they believe that no department policies were violated and 'very seasoned officers' were involved in the incident.

'As of right now, I think everything was perfect,' San Angelo Police Chief Tim Vasquez said. 'The officers reacted the way they were supposed to.

'I know the suspect was hit at least once; he's in critical condition, and I know my guys are fine. They followed policy, and it looks like their training has kept them alive today.'

Vasquez said police responded to a call from a woman  who has not yet been named. She told them a man was threatening her with a firearm and he continued to call and text threats after leaving the area.

'Domestic violence continues to be our number one call for service in our community,' Vasquez said during a news briefing. 'We try to battle it as often as we can. Domestic violence has been a very tragic and too-often occurrence in our community, especially recently with the capital murders that have occurred.'

A couple of hours after the initial domestic violence call, San Angelo Police Department officers tried to make a traffic stop on a vehicle that was circling the area.

The vehicle, which looked similar to the one driven by the suspect,   did not stop, and police embarked on a short pursuit.

When the vehicle did draw to a halt, the driver stepped out carrying a firearm which was later identified by police as a semi-automatic handgun.

At this point Cole was shot by a police officer, although at present it is unclear how many rounds were fired or who fired them.

No officers were injured in the incident and neither was the women who made the initial call.

The vehicle was identified as a red Ford Dodge Ram, which last night appeared to have multiple bullet holes. A police SUV had two bullet holes in the windshield.

Vasquez said that video from officers' vehicles was expected to be downloaded and turned over to Texas Rangers to investigate the incident

He added that the initial call is being investigated as an aggravated assault, and that a second aggravated assault charge might be pending.

He said police have secured a firearm, but did not specify what it was. He said law enforcement officers were still processing the scene and would be in the area for several hours.
