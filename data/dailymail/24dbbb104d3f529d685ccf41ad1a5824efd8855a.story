The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge enjoyed an adrenaline-fuelled jet boat ride through the famous Shotover River Canyons near Queenstown today.

William and Kate were passengers on the white-knuckle Shotover Jet as it raced at 75 mph along the Shotover River on New Zealand's South Island.

The experience has been a major 
tourist attraction in the area, which is a mecca for thrillseekers, since the 1970s.

White-knuckle ride: William and Kate in the bright red boat as it races 75 mph along New Zealand's Shotover River

In safe hands: Shotover Jet operations manager Wayne Paton has worked for the company for 13 years

The two drivers chosen to take the Royal party out on the adventurous trip said they were ‘thrilled and proud’ and called 
the outing a ‘career highlight’.

Shotover Jet operations manager Wayne Paton, 43, and head boat driver Nick Simpson, 39, were handpicked for the role thanks to their extensive industry knowledge and the number of hours spent on the water with passengers.

Mr Paton, originally from Christchurch, and Nick from mid-Canterbury, have worked for Shotover Jet for 13 and ten years respectively. 

While both admitted to being 'a few butterflies' on the day, Wayne took the wheel of the boat containing the Duke and Duchess, while Nick followed close behind with other members of the Royal party.

Safety first: The Royal couple had to don lifejackets before embarking on the thrilling half-hour ride

Making a splash: William urged the captain of the jet boat to go even faster on the adrenaline-fuelled ride

The Royal couple had to don lifejackets and undertake a safety briefing before embarking on the thrilling half-hour ride.

They then sped along the famous 
Shotover River and through the stunning Shotover River Canyons over water as shallow as 10cm.

Mr Paton took them perilously close to boulders, shallows and upturned trees during the nerve-jangling journey.

The 15-seater bright red boat passed just inches from the sides of the ravine at breathtaking speed and span through 360 degree turns.

Mr Paton said: 'William kept on shouting at me 'go closer, Wayne, go closer'. Kate was amazed that the boats could go over such shallow water but the prince was very knowledgeable about how they worked.

'They screamed and shouted at some of the more hair-raising bits and seemed to have a great time.

'They had a blast, so that’s my job well done.'

The jet boats, which are powered by a revolutionary water jet system, were invented by New Zealander Sir William Hamilton and tour operators have been using them in the region for over 40 years.

Wayne said he talked to the Duke and 
Duchess and others on the boat about how jet boating was invented, the river’s gold history and pointed out landmarks such 
as Coronet Peak along the way.

'Yes there were some nerves but I feel safer driving the boat than I do driving my car home, because it’s what we do as a job.'

Stunning location: Shotover Jet is the only company permitted to operate within the famous Shotover River Canyons

Having a blast: The Shotover Jet is a popular tourist activity in Queenstown, which is known as the adventure capital of New Zealand

The Shotover Jet, the aquatic 
equivalent of rallying, takes passengers through a four-mile stretch of 
the Shotover river near Queenstown on South Island.

The
 company is the only one permitted to operate within the famous Shotover
 River Canyons, which consist primarily of steep rock walls that have 
been carved over thousands of years by billions of tonnes of fast 
flowing river water from the heart of the Southern Alps.

The tourist firm takes 130,000 tourists a year on trips along the fast flowing river.

'When we step in that boat we’re responsible for everyone on board, but we know what we’re doing out there,' said Wayne.

'I’ve
 done over 10,000 trips and I’m in charge of all driver training and 
assessments, so while these are obviously the most high-profile people 
we’ve ever had on board, at the end of the day they’re customers looking
 for an amazing adrenalin experience and we treated them just like 
that.'

Queenstown, which is on New Zealand's South Island, is also a major destination for snowboarders, skiers and was the place where the bungee jump was invented.

Taking a joy ride: Kate and Wills seemed to love the high energy ride in their bright red vests

Nick, who has driven nearly 13,000 
trips on the Shotover River, said the day had started as every other one
 did, with the drivers and mechanics going over each boat in painstaking
 detail.

'Maintenance is 
second-to-none in our world, and that’s why Shotover Jet is so proactive
 in our maintenance programmes and driver training.

'Yes, we operate in an amazing and fun environment, but its safety first and fun second, that can’t be emphasised enough.

'We’ve got 100 per cent trust in our boats and as far as being on the river, as drivers it’s our ‘happy place’.

'Out
 of all the VIPs we’ve taken down the river over the years, it would be 
hard to top taking these young members of the Royal family.'
