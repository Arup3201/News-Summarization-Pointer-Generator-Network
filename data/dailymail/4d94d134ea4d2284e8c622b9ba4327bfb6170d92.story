Hundreds of homeowners have been told their £400,000 properties could have been built on 'contaminated' land - and it's not safe for their children to play in the area.

Environment officers at Tunbridge Wells Borough Council have warned residents of three streets in  Paddock Wood, Kent, they may be at risk.

They say 'potentially dangerous' chemicals including asbestos and creosote could have seeped in to the ground. The substances could have 'an impact on human health', they added.

Residents of three streets, circled, in Paddock Wood, Kent have been told their homes could have been built on contaminated land. They have been warned not to let their children play with soil in their gardens also

The area used to be a timber yard which built sheds and greenhouses until the early 80s.

The area includes three streets of homes built more than 20 years ago, including The Ridings, Dimmock Close and Le Temple Road.

Experts will now take soil samples from homes to check whether the soil is 'toxic' - while residents have been told to ensure their children don't play with soil in gardens.

Locals have been told to make sure anyone coming into contact with soil should wash their hands and that pets should be 'prevented from digging' in soil. 

One local, who has lived in the area for 15 years, said she was 'furious' that hundreds of people have been exposed to the risk.

The 51-year-old, who asked not to be named, said last week: 'The first we knew about it was when we got a letter through the door saying the council needed to take soil samples.

'When I looked into it further I found out that the soil could be full of chemicals.

'I've brought up three children here and they used to make mud pies and help me do the gardening all the time.

'It beggars belief to think they could have been playing in mud which is filled with poisons.'

Another mother-of-three Toni Williamson, 37, told her local paper, the Kent and Sussex Courier: 'It terrified me when I got the letter.

'It's horrible to think that my kids can't play in the garden without being at risk.

'I feel like now I have to watch them like a hawk 24/7, which is stressful. And I don't understand how you can be expected to stop your pet from digging in the garden.'

A statement from Tunbridge Wells Borough Council said the site was used to make sheds and greenhouses and 'involved treating wood with substances like creosote and used tar like chemicals to preserve them'

It stated: 'These are substances that might still be in the ground.

'There are possible health effects from taking in large amounts of these substances.'

Experts are now being brought in to take soil samples around the area, including Le Temple Road, pictured, to see whether the soil is toxic

It added: 'This area was the site of a former works that we believe may have carried out timber treatment and we will be looking for a number of different chemicals, but mainly for hydrocarbons associated with timber treatment substances like tars and creosotes.

'We have also heard that the site might have been involved in making barns with asbestos material in them so will be looking for that too.'

Residents have also been told by the council that the investigation will mean it 'might make it difficult to sell a property' before the results are known.

It stated: 'While the investigation is being carried out it might make it difficult to sell a property and we know that the possibility of contaminated land on the site has already caused some problems for house sellers.'

Residents of Dimmock Close, pictured, have said today they are 'furious' hundreds of people have been exposed to risk

Head of environment for the council Gary Stevenson said: 'We understand how sensitive this matter is and it is important to us that we keep residents and home owners fully informed.

'We have been in contact with residents and homeowners personally and by letter, and have held two drop-in information sessions.

'We will continue to keep them informed and answer any further questions that they may have.'

Council workers are set to start taking soil samples in June this year and report back to locals in August.
