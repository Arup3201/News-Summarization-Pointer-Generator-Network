The lavish Sydney mansion which once belonged Lachlan Murdoch is back on the market, this time it may topple this year's sale record.

In the affluent harbourside eastern suburb of Sydney, the Point Piper property is expected to sell for more than $37 million according to its selling agent.

The waterfront three-storey home at 110 Wolseley Road has its own private jetty, pool and uninterrupted views of the iconic Harbour Bridge.

Murdoch and his model wife Sarah sold the property to Karyn Zamel, wife of mining engineer Gary Zamel, in 2005 for $20.6 million 

Bart Doff from Laing+Simmons Double Bay told the Sydney Morning Herald the home as 'one of the world's most prized private waterfront trophy holdings'.

He says the house next door to Murdoch's old mansion was previously owned by property developer Ron Medich and sold for about $37 million in June for its 783-square-metre block.

The three-bedroom house which sits on almost 1000 square metres of land has potential to become a four or five-bedroom home.

Other features include a glass-view elevator, a bar, a wine cellar and marble heated floors.

Lachlan and Sararh Murdoch initially paid $12 million for the home in 1999 when they married

Murdoch, 42, and his model wife Sarah sold the property to Karyn Zamel, wife of mining engineer Gary Zamel, in 2005 for $20.6 million. The Murdochs initially paid $12 million for the home in 1999 when they married.

In June, the couple sold their another one of their extravagant waterfront mansions in Bronte - also in Sydney's eastern suburbs - for about $10 million after being put on market for the third time in five years.

They currently own their $23 million Georgian estate in Bellevue Hill which is undergoing an $11.6 million revamp. 

Apart from the Medich house, two other Point Piper properties sold for about $30 million. They include another on Wolseley Road which sold in June for that figure and a Wentworth Street property which went for more than $30 million in August.

Sarah, a 42-year-old former fashion model, married the son of billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch in 1999.

They spent the first half of their married life living in New York before moving back to Sydney in 2005.

They have three children together, sons Kalan, nine, Aidan, seven, and daughter Aerin, three.
