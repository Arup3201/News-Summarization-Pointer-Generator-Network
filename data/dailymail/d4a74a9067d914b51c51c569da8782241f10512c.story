Britain's sizzling summer is set for one final flourish - just in time for the bank holiday weekend.

Forecasters are predicting more sunny weather and temperatures of up to 27degrees in the South East.

More than 6million people are expected to take advantage of blue skies and a long weekend by visiting the country's most popular hot spots.

Scorching: Thousands of sunseekers were on Bournemouth beach again today hoping for another heatwave

Blue skies ahead: Britain's hot spots are likely to be busy again as the warm weather continues

Packed: Brighton beach was full of tourists again today enjoying Britain's sizzling summer

Pack the sun cream: Crowds of families who are already enjoying the summer holidays flocked to Weymouth Beach in Dorset

No end in sight: Blue skies are likely to attract millions more tourists over the long weekend

Final fling: Hot summer temperatures have seen a boom in visits to the UK's tourist spots

The AA estimates 16million drivers will be out over the holiday period.

And airports are also likely to reach crush capacity, with millions more taking advantage of the long weekend to head abroad.

A summer of hot weather at home has given the UK economy a welcome boost and more warm temperature this weekend will help generate a further £1billion, according to VisitEngland.

Hundreds of enthusiastic music fans began pouring into the Reading Festival site today long before doors even opened for ‘early-bird’ campers.

The event, set to attract 90,000 fans a day, gets underway on Friday when American rock legends Green Day are set to headline the main stage.

Forecasters have predicted largely dry and sunny weather for the area, meaning music fans may escape the customary festival mudbath.

Around 4.5million people are planning to take a holiday in the UK involving an overnight stay, and a further 1.8million are going overseas.

But 7.5million remain undecided about whether to stay home or make a trip and will make a decision based on how the weather turns out.

Those staying at home will be able to take advantage of the lifting of some English roadworks on major routes, although restrictions will remain in place at some busy spots.

VisitEngland’s strategy and development director Louise Stewart said: 'July’s heatwave saw an increase in late bookings and a real boost for the tourism industry after a harsh winter and slow spring.'

Celebration: Up to 90,000 music fans will descend on Reading for the annual festival

Fun in the sun: Revellers have started arriving for Reading Festival which takes place this weekend

Scorcher: Bank holiday getaways could be worth up to £1billion for the UK economy

Undecided: Around 7.5million Britons are waiting to see how the weather turns out before choosing whether to stay at home or go away

For those staying at home the best of the weather is likely be in south east England, where temperatures could reach as high as 27C (81F) on Friday before dipping to around 22C (72F) for the rest of the long weekend. Other areas may get showers or longer periods of rain.

Motoring and traffic organisations forecast that Friday will be the busiest day on the roads, with the AA reckoning as many as 16 million drivers will be out over the holiday period.

Travel organisation Abta said Spain remains the number one destination for British holidaymakers, particularly the Balearic and Canary Islands. The Spanish city of Barcelona is also proving popular for a bank holiday city break.

Other top destinations include France, the Greek Islands and Turkey, while top city-break destinations include Amsterdam, Paris, Berlin, Dublin and New York.

Hotting up: Londoners relax in warm temperatures today which could reach up to 27 degrees for the August Bank Holiday

Summer days: The sunshine is expected to continue over the weekend - at least in the South East of England

Sizzling: Highs of 27 this weekend would be 11 degrees hotter than last August

Congestion likely: The AA estimates around 16million drivers will be out over the weekend

Getaway: Millions of Britons will take advantage of the long weekend by taking a trip abroad

Abta said domestic tour operators are seeing demand in south coast and south west resorts in England as well as the Channel Islands.

In south east England, around 425,000 passengers are expected to depart from Heathrow Airport, 255,000 from Gatwick, 125,000 from Stansted, 70,000 from Luton and 15,000 from Southend.

In addition, 160,000 are due to depart from Manchester, 69,000 from Birmingham, 35,000 from Newcastle, 47,000 from Bristol and 30,000 from Leeds Bradford. More than 160,000 will also be leaving from Scottish airports and 60,000 will travel with cross-Channel high-speed train company Eurostar.

Abta chief executive Mark Tanzer said: 'The bank holiday weekend is always one of the busiest of the year as we see holidaymakers jetting off to enjoy the end of their summer breaks. The return of the good weather here in the UK will also provide another boost for domestic tourism.'
