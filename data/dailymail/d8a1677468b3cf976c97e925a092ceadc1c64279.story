It is a longstanding stereotype that the Germans are happy to spend time naked in public, but it seems for the first time the Austrians are set to give them a run for their money.

In a new poll, nearly a third of Austrian holidaymakers admitted they sunbathe in the nude on their travels - the same number as their German neighbours.

When questioned about their holiday habits, 28 per cent of travellers from both nations said they were happy to bare all at the beach.

Buff guide to sunbathing: Germans are still the most likely to go naked while on holiday, research reveals

According to Expedia's annual 
Flip Flop report, which surveyed the behaviours and preferences of 
12,000 holidaymakers across 24 countries in five continents, Europeans were the most at home with nudity on holiday.

European women are more likely to go topless than women from other parts of the world, with nearly half of Austrians (49 per cent) likely to sunbathe topless. 

Spaniards and Germans followed closely behind, with 42 per cent and 39 per cent respectively saying they were happy to ditch their bikini top at the beach.

In comparison, puritanical Britons and Americans are much less comfortable with holidaying in the nude.

While just 12 per cent of Britons will strip off at the beach, a slightly more adventurous 13 per cent of Americans while sunbathe in the buff.

Worldwide, beach nudity is more common among men (18 per cent) than women (6 per cent).

And while the global average for nudity was just 12 per cent, Germans and Austrians bucked the trend, with 28 per cent of holidaymakers saying they're happy to sunbathe naked.

The most modest beachgoers were from Asia, with only 2 per cent of Japanese, 3 per cent of South Korean and 4 per cent of Thai beachgoers admitting to have sunbathed nude.

Still the tops: Beach holidays are still voted the most-favoured destination

But being modest didn't translate into being uncomfortable with the practice, however. Nearly
 three-quarters of Japanese beachgoers said they were 'very' or 
'somewhat' comfortable with beach nudity or female toplessness.

The Spanish weren't far behind, with 74 per cent saying they are happy with nudity on the beach. But just 29 per cent of Hong Kong residents accepted naked bathers on holiday, with just 28 per cent comfortable with the practice in India and 34 per cent in Malaysia.

And it's not all about nude sunbathing. Brazilians showed they are happy to strut their stuff in miniature swimsuits, with 95 per cent saying they are happy to wear a Speedo on the beach.

The Austrians weren't far behind, with 94 per cent happy to don a pair of 'budgie smugglers', followed by 91 per cent of Germans and Spanirads.

The least likely to 
approve of Speedos were Norwegians, with just 40 per cent considering it 
acceptable attire. As for Americans, 57 per cent were fine with Speedos.

Making a splash: The Brazilians are most likely to don a Speedo, while Spanish women are happy to go topless

The beach remains one of the most popular travel destinations in the world, with the report showing that more than half (56 per cent) of those surveyed said they had taken a beach vacation in the past year.

Meanwhile 73 per cent of those who had taken, or planned to take, a beach holiday said they had achieved 'personal bliss' as a result.

'The beach
 is the world's most popular travel destination by a considerable 
margin,' said John Morrey, vice president and general manager of 
Expedia.com, .

'So
 every year we ask travellers all over the world to tell us their likes 
and dislikes as they relate to beach behaviour.'

Other findings included that more than half of the world's beach goers would 'never' post a photo of themselves in swimwear, whether it be a Speedo or a one-piece.
