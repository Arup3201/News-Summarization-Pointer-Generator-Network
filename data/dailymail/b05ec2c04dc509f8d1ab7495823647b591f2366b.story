Finance Minister Mathias Cormann has announced that the government has signed a deal with the Palmer United Party on the repeal of the mining tax, with it expected to be passed today.

The bill is set to be pushed through the Senate this afternoon, with a series of amendments agreed to by PUP and Motoring Enthusiast Party Senator Ricky Muir  

Labor Senator Penny Wong labelled it 'another stealth attack' and went further calling it 'another dirty deal they (the Federal Government) have tried to ram through the chamber, as they break promise after promise after promise'.

The Palmer United Party has today agreed to pass the Mining Tax bill with amendments

'We support the amendments put forward by the government because we must remove the mining tax because this unfair tax must be removed as soon as possible,' said PUP Senate Leader Glenn Lazarus.

The school kids bonus, worth $410 for primary school children and double for those in high school, remains in place until the end of 2016.  

The three key measures will cost the government up to $6.5 billion.

'This is a win for Australians,' Senator Lazarus said.

He said that his party would not allow the bill to pass without retention of the school kids bonus, low income super contribution and low income support bonus.

'It's let the big miners off the hook,' said Greens Senate leader Christine Milne.
