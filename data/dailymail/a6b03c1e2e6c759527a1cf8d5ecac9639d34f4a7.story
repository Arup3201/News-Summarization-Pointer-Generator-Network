Suit: Chia Hong is suing Facebook, accusing her former boss Anil wilson (photographed) of discrimination and harassment based on sex and race

Does Facebook lean forward? Not so much, claims one former employee who is suing the social networking giant for gender and race discrimination. 

Despite employing Sheryl Sandberg, one of the nation's leading advocates for working mothers, Chia Hong claims she was belittled by her boss for taking time off to volunteer at her children's school, forced to served drinks to male co-workers and told she should have just stayed home to take care of her child. 

Hong filed a lawsuit with the San Mateo County Superior Court Monday against the social networking giant claiming that her former boss, Anil Wilson, harassed and 'belittled' her for being a woman and for being Taiwanese.

In the lawsuit, Hong claims that Wilson regularly 'ignored' and 'belittled' her opinions and input during group meetings where she was one of few women present. 

Wilson once allegedly asked Hong why she didn't 'just stay home and take care of her child instead of having a career' and scolded her for taking one day off each month to volunteer at her child's school -- a practice permitted by the company. 

A Facebook spokesperson denied the allegations and told Recode that the company has made progress in matters related to gender, diversity, and equality.

'In this case we have substantive disagreements on the facts,' the spokesperson said 'and we believe the record shows the employee was treated fairly.'  

Hong alleges that she was told she was not part of 'the team' because 'she looks different and talks differently than other team members.'

As of 2014, 69 percent of Facebook's employees world-wide are male and 31 percent are female, according to Tech Republic. 

Fair Treatment: A Facebook spokesperson denied the allegations and said that Hong was treated fairly 

A diversity report showed that more than half of the company's employees identify as white.

She claims she was ordered to 'organize parties and serve drinks to her male colleagues' -- actions neither part of her job description nor requested of males at the company.

The mother says she experienced much harassment  and, after she filed a complaint, the company fired her in October 2013 replacing her with an Indian male who, she claims, is 'less qualified' and 'less experienced,' Fox reports. 

The suit states that Hong, who began working for the company in 2010, received good performance reviews, pay raises, and even a promotion. But once she filed the harassment complaint, she received a negative performance evaluation and was fired. 

High-Profile: Hong is being represented by Lawless & Lawless, the San Francisco firm representing Ellen Pao (photographed) in the high-profile gender discrimination case against Silicon Valley's venture capital firm

Hong is suing the company for damages stemming from sex and race harassment and discrimination, retaliation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, discharge in violation of public policy, legal fees, and punitive damages. 

The suit states that the amount demanded exceeds $25,000. She is seeking a jury trial as well.

Hong is being represented by Lawless & Lawless, the San Francisco firm representing Ellen Pao in the high-profile gender discrimination case against Silicon Valley's venture capital firm. 

Some speculate that the Pao case will serve as precedent for other cases and may encourage women to come forward with similar claims, according to Recode. 

Wilson did not immediately respond to request for comment from Daily Mail Online.
