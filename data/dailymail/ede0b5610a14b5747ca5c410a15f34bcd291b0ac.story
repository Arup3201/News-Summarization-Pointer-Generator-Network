Preparation: Wayne Rooney seemed to benefit from the pre-season tour

New United boss Van
 Gaal led his team out of Manchester airport on Tuesday afternoon as the
 likes of Wayne Rooney and Phil Jones followed closely behind.

After an impressive pre-season, the Dutchman must now decide who has made the grade and earned a place in the Red Devils squad for the forthcoming season.

Van Gaal admits it will not be easy to sign the players he thinks are needed to improve Manchester United.

Despite only assuming his position just two days before leaving for the US, Van Gaal racked up victories over the Los Angeles Galaxy, Roma, Inter Milan, Real Madrid and Liverpool.

The Dutchman has admitted he wants to sign new defenders before the season starts, but he concedes landing his targets will prove hard.

'Manchester United shall buy players when we can improve our selection,' the United manager said.

'And that is a lot more difficult than you think.'
