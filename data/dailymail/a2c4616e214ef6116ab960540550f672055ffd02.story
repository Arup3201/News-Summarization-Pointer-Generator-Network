Education ministers and their staff 'lacked inquisitiveness' about fears of extremism in schools, a report warned today.

The Department for Education has been told it needs to 'always be vigilant and inquisitive' after an internal review said the issue was not taken as seriously as concerns about child protection.

Chris Wormald, the ministry's top official, was asked to carry out the review following the Trojan Horse allegations of a hardline Muslim takeover plot at a number of Birmingham schools.

Chris Wormald, the permanent secretary at the Department for Education, said the ministry needed to have robust systems in place to play its part in preventing and dealing with the threat

To date there have been four other reports into allegations of extremism in Birmingham schools.

None found evidence of a conspiracy violent extremism or radicalisation in schools in in the city, but they raised concerns about the role of governors in influencing policy and the promotion of an 'aggressive Islamic ethos'. 

Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has stressed the importance of all schools teaching 'British values' of tolerance and free speech.

Mr Wormald said he had found no instances of the Department for Education ignoring 'specific warnings' of extremism in schools but said it needed to have robust systems in place to play its part in preventing and dealing with the threat.

He said that issues on extremism have been treated as 'one-offs' and assumed by the DfE to be the responsibility of other authorities. 

The review looked at the 20-year period between 1994 and December 2013 and any warnings received by the DfE relating to alleged extremism in Birmingham schools.

It found that on a small number of occasions, the department received information about these issues, but concludes that these were largely dealt with 'in line with procedures in place at the time'.

There were no instances in which ministers, officials or advisers acted inappropriately, the review adds.

But it goes on to say that warnings were raised about issues such as difficult relationships between staff and governors in certain schools, the potential narrowing of a school curriculum and the fact that these issues 'have the potential to cause political, cultural and religious tensions in schools and their communities'.

These matters are similar to those raised in Peter Clarke's report into the Trojan Horse situation, the review says.

Mr Wormald concludes: 'Whilst I have not found instances of warnings having been ignored or of individuals having acted inappropriately, I have found that the Department has lacked inquisitiveness about this issue, and that procedures could have been tighter than they were. 

'Whilst this is an easy thing to say in hindsight, there is a marked contrast between, for example, how the Department responds to reports of child protection issues and how it has historically responded to reports of potential extremism.

'Overall I find that in future the Department needs to be more vigilant, more inquisitive and have more robust systems in place than it has had in the past if in future it is to play its part in preventing and countering the issues identified in the Clarke Report.'

In her response to the report, Mrs Morgan said she endorsed the findings and recommendations and that further measures are being taken. 

This includes introducing a formal system for staff to refer concerns about extremism to the Due Diligence and Counter Extremism Division and bringing in a formal case handling system within this division for logging and managing warnings.

Mr Wormald added: 'Issues on extremism in Birmingham schools that have been raised with the Department have in general been assumed to be the responsibility of other authorities, and when they have been brought to the Department's attention have been dealt with as one-off pieces of transactional business. 

'With hindsight, I believe the Department could have shown a greater level of inquisitiveness regarding these issues, and asked itself the question of whether the issues being brought to its attention were symptomatic of wider trends.'

The review was prompted by the Trojan Horse letter in Birmingham in December 2013 and subsequent investigations by former anti-terror chief Mr Clarke, Ofsted and Ian Kershaw's inquiry for Birmingham City Council, which noted that warning signs about potential extremism in the city's schools had been missed by local agencies over a long period of time.

The letter - now widely believed to be a hoax - referred to an alleged plot by hardline Muslims to seize control of a number of school governing boards in the city.

In June, Ofsted issued a damning verdict on the running of a number of Birmingham's schools and declared five failing, placing them into special measures.

Mr Clarke's report found no evidence of terrorism, radicalisation or violent extremism but did conclude that there was ''clear evidence'' that there were a number of people, associated with each other and in positions of authority within some Birmingham schools who ''espouse, endorse or fail to challenge extremist views''.

There were six instances where concerns were raised with the Department, the review found.

Separately, there was also a letter sent to Lord Hill in March 2013, then leader of the House of Lords by Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, which Lord Hunt said they discussed. The letter raised similar issues to those in the Clarke report. This letter was not formally part of Mr Wormald's review.
