A toddler has died after being shot in the chest with a BB gun by his father at their Atlanta Georgia apartment earlier today.

The 18-month-old boy was carried to an ambulance, bleeding, after his father, Jesse Sellers, allegedly fired the gun at him, not realizing it was loaded.

The 23-year-old, who has been charged with murder, had been trying to scare his young son, named Jesstin, according to a relative.

Questioned: Jesse Sellers, the boy's father, has been charged with murder

A neighbor told the Atlanta Journal Constitution the father was apologizing to police as his son was taken away by ambulance, telling them: 'I'm sorry, but I didn't mean to.'

Police have not said officially who shot the toddler, but homicide detectives said earlier in the day charges were likely against Mr Sellers.

'Charges to the father, for sure. We base 
the charges on the facts that we learn in the investigation,' homicide unit commander Captain Paul Guerrucci, who was careful not to describe the incident as a shooting, said.

He added that a BB rifle was removed the apartment after the incident, which happened at about 9.15am on Friday.

'The caller said her young child had 
been shot in the chest with what she believed was a BB gun,' Captain Guerrucci 
said. 'We found a child that had sustained some type of injury to the 
chest. Information that we are receiving would indicate thatÂ  [the child 
was shot with a BB gun].'

Three adults and three children were in the apartment at the time of the incident. Jesstin was the youngest of the couple's four children. The other siblings are aged 2, 3, and 5.

Neighbors told 11 Live the mother tried to give Jesstin CPR and went to the hospital with him in the ambulance.

Wille Dickerson, who said he was the child's uncle, described the family as close and said they spent time together every day.

The father had been said to be facing charges of second degree cruelty to children and felony murder, according to CBS Atlanta. He was charged with murder on Friday afternoon.

The Division of Family Child Services is assessing what to do with his other children.
