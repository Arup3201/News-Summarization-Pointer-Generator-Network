Manchester United legend Paul Scholes believes that the club should be targeting Bayern Munich midfielder Toni Kroos, with the former England international claiming that new signing Ander Herrera isn’t at the same level as the German ace.

Scholes, who remains a paid ambassador at Old Trafford, raved over Kroos’ qualities in his column for Paddy Power, arguing that Manchester United have missed out on a great player by passing up on the German midfielder.

‘I love watching Toni Kroos,’ Scholes enthused, 'I think he’s brilliant.

'I love the way he controls the ball and controls games. He can really play a pass and has superb vision.

'Kroos is capable of scoring goals too, from outside the box on either foot.

‘I just wish Man United had signed him. Yes, it is good to see United bringing in new players, but they haven’t signed anything like the quality of Kroos.’

Shaw thing: United confirmed the signing of left-back Shaw from Southampton last week

United last week made their first serious movements in the summer transfer window when they splashed £28.8million on Athletico Bilbao midfielder Ander Herrera before signing Luke Shaw from Southampton in a deal that will exceed £28m.

It is understood that Bayern star Kroos emerged as one of the club’s top targets while David Moyes was in charge at Old Trafford and United officials were confident of securing a summer move.

However, the situation has changed since Louis van Gaal took over and Kroos now looks set for a move to Real Madrid.

Other targets: Van Gaal is said to be pursuing Juventus' Chilean midfielder Arturo Vidal

Although the German only has one year remaining on his deal at Bayern, Van Gaal has decided that United should pursue other targets in the close season, with Juventus’ Arturo Vidal, AC Milan’s Nigel De Jong, Sporting Lisbon’s William Carvalho and Roma’s Kevin Strootman all under consideration.
