A Croatian bee-keeper died just 10 minutes after suffering a bee sting after it turned out he was allergic to the insects.

Rato Topic, 47, from the southern town of Zadar was treated by emergency medics who were at the scene within minutes, but they could not save his life.

His friend Zdravko Skorput, 43, said Mr Topic, who had over a dozen hives for more than a decade, had no idea he was allergic to the insects as he had never been stung before.

It is understood he died from anaphylactic shock.

Medics were able to remove a sting from his neck, but it failed to save his life.

The Croatian Times reported the bee stung Mr Topic under a mask, and right into an artery.

Mr Skorput said: 'This happens once in a million of cases.'
