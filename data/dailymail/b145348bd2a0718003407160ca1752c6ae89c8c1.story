Teenage pregnancy rates have fallen to their lowest levels since the 1960s.

Figures released yesterday showed that conceptions among under-18s dropped by 10 per cent in 2012.

But teenage abortion rates have risen sharply in the past decade, the Office for National Statistics revealed.

The under-18 conception rate fell in 2012 to 27.9 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 17

Reasons
 for the sudden decrease in pregnancies include more girls staying in 
further education and the growing ‘stigma’ of teenage motherhood, 
officials said.

The conception rate for women aged 40 and over has more than doubled since 1990, while the number of women in this age group conceiving has risen from 12,032 in 1990 to almost 29,000 in 2011 and 2012. 

For women aged 40 and over, the percentage of conceptions leading to abortion fell from 43 per cent in 1990 to 28 per cent in 2010, 2011 and 2012.

The ONS said: ‘Reasons for an increased number of women conceiving at ages 30 and above include increased participation in higher education, increased female participation in the labour force, the increasing importance of a career, the rising opportunity costs of childbearing, labour market uncertainty, housing factors and instability of partnerships.’

Independent 
experts also cited the fall in the popularity of drinking, drugs and 
smoking and pointed out that many youngsters spend time alone on the 
internet, instead of mixing with others on the streets.

The
 sudden fall in teenage pregnancies came two years after the Coalition 
stopped millions being poured into distributing condoms and employing 
sex advisers for teenagers, through Labour’s £250million Teenage 
Pregnancy Strategy (TPS). The rate has dropped by 25 per cent since 2009
 – the last full year of the TPS.

Professor
 David Paton, of Nottingham University, said: ‘These figures demonstrate
 that it is not the provision of contraception which is having an 
effect. During the years of big spending, there was very little change 
in teenage pregnancy rates.’

The
 ONS report said the figures could be due to ‘a shift in aspirations of 
young women towards education and the perception of stigma associated 
with being a teenage mother’. Early motherhood can be ‘associated with 
poor educational achievement, poor physical and mental health, social 
isolation, poverty and related factors’, it added.

There
 were 27,834 pregnancies among under-18s in England and Wales in 2012 – 
down by around 10 per cent from the 31,051 in 2011. It is the lowest 
under-18 pregnancy rate since 1969.

In 2012, there were an estimated 884,748 conceptions in women of all ages, compared with 909,109 in 2011, a decrease of 2.7 per cent

The
 TPS failed to make any serious dent in the figures in the nine years 
after it was launched by Tony Blair in 1999 – and in two of those years 
conception rates actually went up. As well as the provision of condoms 
and advisers to teach teenagers how to use them, the scheme gave advice 
on abortions – which have risen sharply over the past decade, according 
to the ONS.

Its report said
 almost half of under-18 pregnancies end in abortion – compared to two 
in five in 1992 – and six out of ten pregnant under-16s have a 
termination.

But older women
 are increasingly unlikely to abort a baby. The termination rate across 
all ages fell from 22.5 per cent in 2002 to 20.8 per cent in 2012.

After
 the Coalition abolished the TPS its ex-head, Alison Hadley, said in 
2011: ‘I could well predict that over the next year or so the rates will
 stall or start increasing.’ But yesterday’s figures show that instead 
teenage pregnancies fell at an unprecedented rate.
