Benjamin Benit's remains were found wrapped up in a sheet in a bush

A RAF war hero lay dead and forgotten in his council flat for nine years before his body was thrown under a bush, an inquest heard.

An unknown fraudster had been collecting Benjamin Benit's pension since he died and even after the body was dumped, Southwark Coroner's Court heard.

When Benjamin Benit's remains were 
eventually found wrapped up in a sheet in undergrowth he was still 
wearing an England replica shirt from the 2002 World Cup and his left 
hand was missing - it was later found in his old home.

Detectives later arrested a man who initially gave his name as Benjamin Benit, but later said he was called Sidney Jackson,  but he was released without charge.

Police are still in the dark as to who was claiming the dead man's pension and who callously chucked the war hero's body beneath a bush.

A dog walker made the grisly discovery of Mr Benit's decomposed body in Lovelinch Close, Peckham, south London on August 10, last year.Â 

The inquest heard the body had only recently been moved from Mr Benit's flat.

Sawdust from a nearby tree being cut was underneath the bag containing Mr Benit, showing he had been left there after August 5.

The left hand was discovered by council officers when Mr Benit's home in Ilderton Road, Peckham was cleared out by council officers on August 23.

Mr Benit was born in south London on 6 June 1925, and served in the RAF during World War II.

He lived for a time in Bradford, where he had family, before returning to south London in the 1980s.

Sad end: The body was found ditched beneath a shrub in Lovelinch Close, Peckham

Mr Benit was a regular customer in pubs around Old Kent Road and New Cross Road in south east London.

He had missed a routine GP appointment in April 2002 and would have been 76 at the time of his death.

'From
all the available evidence, it follows that Benjamin Benit came by his 
death in an unknown way in the year 2002,' said coroner Tony Badenoch.

'The police identified that the pension of Mr Benit had been accessed in the years since 2002.

'I note from the inquiries that pension cheques were cashed on August 15 and August 22.

'It is plain from all the material that it wasn't Benjamin Benit cashing his own pension but somebody else.'

Detectives arrested pensioner Sidney Jackson and questioned him about the discovery of the body.

Mr Badenoch said: 'He gave me some answers to some limited questions, and it was clear in his answers he told me he didn't know where Benjamin Benit had been living, and didn't know how he came to be in Lovelinch Close.'

Mr Badenoch added: 'The body was severely decomposed and wrapped in a sheet, but still dressed.'

'Cleaners found what they later learned was a human left hand.

'The presence of the hand at Heversham House indicates that he had been at that address prior to August 5, 2011.

'The police then inquired how Mr Benit may have arrived in Lovelinch Close in a deceased and seriously decomposed state.

'It was blatantly obvious he had been placed there.'

Mr Badenoch said he did not have enough information to conclude the specific cause of Mr Benit's death.

They recorded an open verdict.
