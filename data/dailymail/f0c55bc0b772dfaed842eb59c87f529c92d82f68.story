England’s experiment of having two coaches fell apart when tension arose between Andy Flower and Ashley Giles over the need to rest the best players from one-day matches. Now, things could be different.

There is a strong case for Paul Farbrace, an impressive assistant coach amid the rubble of this World Cup, to be given extra responsibility for limited-overs cricket if England are bold and pick a largely different one-day team when they move on from this disaster.

The primacy of Test cricket remains an important principle but there is no doubt it has contributed to the worst World Cup showing of them all.

If England are serious about closing a gap which has become a gaping chasm between them and the best one-day nations, they need to have completely different personnel to the Test team.

And Farbrace, who guided Sri Lanka to the Asia Cup and World Twenty20 titles last year, has been a calm and sensible presence here. He remains a firm believer that England coach Peter Moores will get it right - another reason the pair should be able to share coaching responsibilities.

‘It’s unfair that Peter is the one in the limelight,’ said Farbrace ahead of this morning’s dead rubber against Afghanistan.

‘At the last ICC tournament, I left having been head coach of the team that won it and you take the adulation then. But you also receive the stick when things go badly. We’re all responsible, not just Pete.’

Farbrace also addressed the controversial subject of statistics, adding: ‘When I was with Sri Lanka we had a lot more meetings and looked at stats a lot more than England do.’
