Cat lovers won't be able to resist this adorable orange feline called Ginger.

In this hilarious video, uploaded by Cesiley Trevino, each time the cat hears the sound of packing tape ripping, she immediately sticks out her tongue in response.

And it's no fluke - in just 50 seconds, the cat drops its tongue 20 times.
