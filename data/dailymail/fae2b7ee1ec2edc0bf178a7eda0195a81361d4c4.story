Alexander Belenky, a former amateur boxer and veteran commentator, said the mach was 'just good PR action,' echoing claims the fight had been fixed. 

Others suggested the match had been put together an opportunity for the 62-year-old to make money by defeating 29-year-old Seymour.

Sceptics have suggested Mickey Rourke's 'victory' was not genuine and that the actor's opponent surrendered the match

The actor, famed for his role in The Wrestler, beat his opponent in two rounds yesterday after a 20 year absence from the sport.  

Speaking of the match held in Moscow this week, Mr Belenky said: 'Mickey Rourke boxing - I'm too old for going to the circus.' 

'This 'performance' is just a good PR action,' he added, describing Seymour as 'a born loser' who has 'won only once in the last ten years'. 

His accusations were echoed by other industry insiders including Andrey Bazdrev, former press secretary to the Russian Professional Boxing Federation, who dismissed it as 'open clownery'.  

 'The promoters won't speak about it openly, because if they do they would not have sold the tickets,' he said. 

Others suggested the fight had been planned as an opportunity for the actor to make money. 

Seymour, who was 33 years younger than the 62-year-old actor, went down in the second round of the match

Seymour jabs with his left during the bout in Moscow, Russia, on Friday night. Critics suggested the 29-year-old was chosen as he would be easily defeated by Bourke 

'(His participation) was first of all a performance, The Wrestler movie in real life. 

'And don't forget about the financial background of his come-back,' said commentator Dmitry Klipin. 

'It is hard for me to say anything about the strength of 29-year-old Seymour but I think this opponent was especially chosen for Rourke, considering his age and physical abilities. 

'Meat-mincing is not good for a man on pension.' 

It was also claimed the actor had been drafted in to deliver a blow from Putin to America, with internet users questioning the pair's friendship online. 

On 25 November the actor was seen wearing a T-shirt with the Russian president's face on it. 

 'I have met Putin and I got the impression that we liked each other,' he said. 'It seems to me he is a good chap, this is why I bought this T-shirt. 

'I did not come here for money. I will see how this match will go, but I would like to have more matches and the only place where I would like to hold them is here, in Russia.'

MailOnline has contacted the star's agent and the Boxing Federation of Russia in regard to the allegations.

Rourke starred in The Wrestler, a film about about a washed-up wrestler, in 2008 and won a Golden Globe
