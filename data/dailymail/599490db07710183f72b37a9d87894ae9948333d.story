Life-changing: Faye Sarr, 27, says Jimmy Savile repeatedly molested her when she worked as a waitress in a Leeds restaurant at 14

A woman says she was repeatedly molested by Jimmy Savile in the fish and chip restaurant where she worked as a 14-year-old - a dreadful experience that inspired her to become a child protection officer.

Faye Sarr, 27, is a now a social worker in Yorkshire and said she was 'groomed' by Savile, then in his 70s, who laughed as he groped her.

As well as touching her all over her body, on one occasion the paedophile pushed her up against a wall and forced kisses on her.

Ms Sarr broke her silence as the Metropolitan Police revealed there are at least 300 victims who were attacked by the DJ.

Police also raided Savile’s secluded Scottish holiday home as they pursued more than 400 lines of inquiry.

Ms Sarr said her abuse lasted six months while she worked at Marlows Fish and Chip Restaurant in Roundhay, where Savile lived in Leeds.

She told how Savile dubbed her his 'private waitress' at the restaurant, one of his favourite haunts.

'He followed me into a back changing room where the waitresses took a break and pretended he had gone the wrong way,' she said.

'He said "Oops, but while I’m in here," and pushed me up against the wall and tried to kiss me and was laughing at me.

'It was really awful as he found it so funny. I managed to turn my cheek to him nstead of my lips and wriggled out of his grip and ran away. I was very upset.

Allegation: DJ Jimmy Savile at his house in Leeds - from where he would go for fish and chips at a local restaurant where Ms Sarr worked as a teenager

Difficult: Faye struggled for years to cope with what happened but is now a social worker in child protection as well as a married mother of one

'He even asked me to go back to his flat. Everyone could hear and he said it like he was pretending, but he meant it.

Hope: Faye says that she has explained what happened to encourage more people to come forward and speak to police like she has

'I recall he said "Do you want to come back to my place in Roundhay Park and be my private waitress?

'I never did, thankfully, but who knows what might have happened. Now I have heard about the rape allegations and other assaults, I know it could have been much worse.

'I feel angry now as I blamed myself. I did not realise I was being exploited. Everyone thought he was wonderful.'

Now married and mother to a five-year-old girl, Faye was brought up in Roundhay  and enjoyed her work in the restaurant when predator Savile wasn’t visiting.

She said: “It all happened during 1998-99 when I was still at school and worked part-time as a waitress. Jimmy Savile would come in at tea-time for a meal and we all used to laugh because we thought he was a bit odd.

'He would flirt with the waitresses but seemed to make a fuss of me and always did things like drop cutlery on the floor and ask me to pick it up.

'He would also leave me massive tips. It was great if you smiled and were nice to him. But one time he really groped my bottom, not just a brush it was awful.

'Later I told my mum and she was livid. She wanted to go to the police but I  wouldn’t. Eventually I just left my job.

'I always hated seeing his picture after what happened. But if speaking out helps other people to come forward, if they are being abused, then I am happy to talk about it.'
