New cars are continuing to fly off forecourts helping Britain drive away austerity as industry experts reported the highest January trade figures since 2007.

A total of 164,856 new vehicles were registered last month - a 6.7 per cent rise on the January 2014 figure.

Last month's booming car sales represented the 35th successive month of growth, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).

January's figures were boosted by an 18.1 per cent increase in fleet registrations. It was also the strongest January for sales since 2007. 

A total of more than 2.47million new cars were sold in 2014 - the highest annual figure for 10 years and the fourth-highest ever. 

The Ford Fiesta came top of the list of best-selling models in January followed by the Vauxhall Corsa, Ford Focus, Nissan Qashqai and Volkswagen Golf.

The top ten included the Audi A3 in sixth place followed by Mercedes-Benz C Class, Volkswagen Polo, Fiat 500 and Vauxhall Astra.

SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: 'These figures mark an encouraging start to the year after a very strong 2014, with a strikingly robust company car market as businesses take advantage of the attractive finance offers currently available.

'January saw increased uptake of both petrol and diesel cars, while demand for alternatively-fuelled vehicles continued its surge with registrations rising by 60.8 per cent. 

'Registrations of plug-in vehicles were particularly strong as consumers responded to a greater choice of makes and models delivering lower running costs.'

He went on: 'Last year's 9.3 per cent rise in the overall market was fuelled by stronger-than-expected economic confidence and, for 2015, we expect to see some levelling off throughout the year.

'Demand is back to pre-recession levels following record-breaking growth.'
