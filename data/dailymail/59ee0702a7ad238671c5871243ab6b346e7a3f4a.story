Ever since he asked followers to meme him on November 10, Bill Cosby has seen one woman after another accuse him of rape.

On Monday the 77-year-old comedian - who lit up the eighties with his hit sitcom The Cosby Show - made the cover of three weeklies, People, UsWeekly and The National Enquirer, where his character was called into question.

'You didn't say no to him,' a source told People, adding, 'He freely made jokes about women's bodies.'

So far at least 15 women have accused the actor of sexual assault but he has denied wrong doing, instead calling the claims 'innuendo.' A class action lawsuit may be brought against the TV fixture, said one accuser.

Cover boy: Bill Cosby, who has been accused of sexual assault by at least 15 women, landed on People magazine on Monday where a source said he 'freely made jokes about women's bodies'

The People insider also made it seem as if the married star had a massive ego. 'He marched the halls of NBC like he was Oz,' added the source. The Cosby Show aired from 1984 to 1992.

Another source that worked on his later show Cosby, which aired from 1996 to 2000, explained that Bill could intimidate people.

'He was very courteous, but he expected things to be done in a certain way,' said the source. 'He didn't suffer fools. A lot of people were afraid of him on-set.'

Another cover: In the new issue of UsWeekly, the 77-year-old star is attacked by former model Janice Dickinson who said she is speaking now because women need to be warned

Janice Dickinson, who claimed Bill assaulted her in 1982, told UsWeekly, 'Bill Cosby is a monster.' As far as talking about the past, the brunette E! fixture said, 'It's justice - it has to be done.'

The former supermodel, 59, explained why she was speaking out now. 'I'm doing it for all women who've had their innocence robbed. And I want women who know Cosby to be worried. It happened to me; it could still happen to them.'

The National Enquirer claimed that this collection of explosive claims could lead to a divorce from his wife of 50 years, Camille.

And then there is this: The National Enquirer suggested the allegations may lead to a split with his wife of 50 years Camille and there could be $350m at stake

The weekly estimated the divorce could put a dent in his $350m fortune if it were to happen.

'She survived the tragic murder of their beloved son [Ennis, 27, in 1997], and she bravely stood by Bill during the disclosure of an extramarital affair and a "love child" but there's only so much more she can take,' said the source.

'I know Camille is feeling humiliated by all this - and even worse, she's come under personal attack.'

An insider also told The Enquirer, 'Whether Camille will continue to stand by her man is in question.' 

One of his accusers, Carla Ferrigno, brought Camille into the mix.

'She's known all these years,' Carla alleged in a radio interview. 'This is disgusting that she would stay with this man.'

Jewel Allison is the latest woman to accuse the former Jell-O spokesman - who has never been charged with a crime - of rape.

She has claimed that the comedian spiked her glass of wine during a dinner at his Philadelphia home in the late eighties before forcing her to touch his genitals.

Jewel has said he may be the 'greatest serial rapist that ever got away with it.' 

One accuser said this weekend that she was planning to mount a class action lawsuit against Cosby with as many as nine other women.

Actress Louisa Moritz, who claimed Cosby assaulted her before an appearance on the Tonight Show, told TMZ that she had reached out to other alleged victims to join her legal case.

The 68-year-old star of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest said she was sitting in the green room before her spot on the show in 1971 when Cosby entered the room.

She claimed he implied 'that he was going to see to it that I will become a major star' before forcing her to perform oral sex.

Ms Moritz alleged that as Cosby left, after the abuse, he said: 'Now you don't want to upset me and the plans for your future, do you?'

Cosby's lawyer Martin Singer has said branded the stories 'completely illogical' and added that the claims are 'increasingly ridiculous' and 'passed the point of absurdity'.

In a statement released on Friday, he said: 'The new, never-before-heard claims from women who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated, fantastical stories about things they say occurred 30, 40, or even 50 years ago have escalated far past the point of absurdity.

'These brand new claims about alleged decades-old events are becoming increasingly ridiculous, and it is completely illogical that so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years.'

Andrea Constand - A Temple University employee, she claimed in 2006 that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier.

Barbara Bowman - Bowman told MailOnline that Cosby raped and drugged her back in 1985 when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. Bowman was one of the 13 Jane Does in the 2006 trial against Cosby.

Traitz, of Hallandale Beach, Florida, has been charged in the past with trafficking pills. Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, is trying to use Traitz's past to discredit her claims against his client.
