This security footage could be the last known recording of virgin killer Elliot Rodger, just hours before he went on his bloody gun rampage.

A figure wearing a T-shirt, shorts and a baseball cap walks up to the door of Giovanni's pizza restaurant in Isla Vista, lingers around outside, talking on the phone for a few seconds and then walks off.

Waitress Ally Kubie was working in the restaurant at the time and she is convinced she came face to face with the mass murderer on the morning of the massacre.

This security footage could be the last known recording of virgin killer Elliot Rodger, just hours before he went on his bloody gun rampage

A figure wearing a t-shirt, shorts and a baseball cap walks up to the door of Giovanni's pizza restaurant in Isla Vista, lingers around outside, talking on the phone for a few seconds and then walks off

She saw the man approach the restaurant and assumed he was going to walk in and order. When he stopped short, she asked him if he needed any help, but he apparently just stared at her intensely and gave her a 'creepy smile'.

Ally, 20, was so freaked out by the incident that she walked into the back of the restaurant and to her relief the man was gone by the time she came back.  

She put the encounter out of her mind until later that night when a friend sent her Rodger's sinister YouTube confession, in which he describes his, 'Day of Retribution.'

By that stage six people were dead and 13 injured. The moment Ally watched the footage, she immediately recognized Rodger as the man she had come face to face with that morning.

Speaking to MailOnline, Ally, originally
 from Atlanta Georgia, said: 'I am sure it was him. He had that same 
creepy smile and the same facial expressions that the killer pulled in 
the YouTube video.

Ally, originally from Atlanta Georgia, said she is sure the man was Rodger, pictured. 'He had that same creepy smile and the same facial expressions that the killer pulled in the YouTube video,' she said

Giovanni's pizza restaurant, pictured, is a popular hangout for students in Isla Vista

'The moment I saw the video I thought, "I know that guy," then when he started smiling, I thought, "that's the guy from Giovanni's".

'I was so freaked out by it. I couldn't sleep at all that night. I have been trying not to think about it too much, but every now and again I think, "I am really lucky. Something terrible could have happened to me."'

'I don't know why he was there, but he definitely didn't want to order pizza. I was alone in the restaurant, so I guess anything could have happened.'

The footage was shot at around 11.19 a.m. on Friday morning. It is not yet known when Rodger's started his killing spree, brutally stabbing roommates Weihan Wang, 20, of Fremont, and Cheng Yuan Hong, 20, of San Jose and their friend George Chen, 19, also of San Jose.

It could have been just hours before, or
 even soon after the video was taken. What is known is that at around 
9.27 p.m. Rodgers, 22, shot and killed Katherine Cooper, 22, and 
Veronika Weiss, 19 outside Alpha Phi sorority house. He then drove to IV
 Deli Mart where he shot his final victim Chris Martinez.

Ally said she saw the man, shown here in security footage, approach the restaurant and assumed he was going to walk in and order. When he stopped short, she asked him if he needed any help, but he apparently just stared at her intensely and gave her a 'creepy smile'

The moment Ally watched the footage, she immediately recognized Rodger's as the man she had come face to face with that morning

Ally had no idea any of this was going to unfold when she first spotted the man approaching the shop.

She said: 'I was in the back and I walked out to put something on the counter. My colleague was out on a delivery, so I was on my own.

'I saw this guy in a baseball cap walk up to the door on his phone. I assumed he was going to come in and order, so I walked behind the counter.

'But he just leant against the little wall by the patio and stared at me. He kept looking at me for a few seconds. It was really creepy. I was pretty weirded out by it, so I asked him if he wanted any help.

'That's when he gave me this really creepy smile. It scared me, so I walked in the back and by the time I came back out he had gone.'

Ally's reaction to the individual can be seen on camera footage, shot on a second device inside the shop.

She went on: 'I got on with my shift and
 later that night I was out with my friend when we heard a car crash 
down the street. We ran over to see what it was and saw the cops all 
round this guy.'

Ally stops and looks at the man, clearly finding his behavior odd

Although Ally didn't realize it at the time, she had just witnessed the aftermath of Rodger's rampage, which culminated in a gun battle with police.

After letting off rounds at officers, he crashed his black BMW and by the time he had been pulled out of the wreckage he was dead, having suffered a single gunshot wound to the head. It is believed he shot himself with one of the 400 bullets he had left in his car.

Ally went on: 'I was at home later that night and my friend sent me a link to the guy's YouTube video.

The moment I watched it I recognized him. It was really creepy.

'Then I found out he lived just a block away from me. I used to walk past his apartment every day. It's so horrible to think he killed those people in there.

'If I'm honest I'm trying not to think about it. After all, nothing happened and I'm OK, but sometimes I do think how lucky I am that he didn't come in and do something.'

The owner of the popular restaurant Matt Meczka has watched the video dozens of times and still can't be sure if Rodger is the man who walks up to the door. He said: 'It is impossible to tell.

'The next day there was a big soccer game on and we were absolutely packed at that time. He may have got the days confused and thought that was on Friday and that the restaurant was going to be busy. That is just speculation as no one really knows.'
