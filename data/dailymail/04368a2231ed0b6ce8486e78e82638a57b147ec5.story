What's the price of becoming the greatest quarterback in National Football League history?

About $63,500.

That's the amount New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady may pay the Internal Revenue Service after appearing in Super Bowl XLIX and being named as the game's Most Valuable Player.

Brady, who set multiple records while passing for more than 300 yards and four touchdowns in the 28-24 win for Patriots, was given a red 2015 Chevy Colorado pickup truck as part of his MVP award.

New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady may owe the IRS around $63,500 after appearing in Super Bowl XLIX and being named as the game's Most Valuable Player. He was given a truck as part of the award 

The bill (file photo right) that Brady (left) receives will be just a fraction of his $17million salary for 2014

Malcolm Butler (right) didn't win the Super Bowl MVP award, but he did get the truck that came with the honor

The three-time Super Bowl MVP gave the truck to teammate Malcolm Butler to show his appreciation for the play the defensive back made at the end of the game to help seal the win for New England.

That gift will not go unpunished as the truck is considered a taxable prize under the Internal Revenue Code, section 74., according to Forbes. 

Not only will Brady, 37, have to pay $13,500 in income tax for winning the truck, he will also have to pay a $8,000 gift tax on it. 

His combined federal tax hit for winning the truck and giving it to Butler will be $21,500.

Butler won't owe the IRS anything for the truck as the recipients of gifts are never taxed.

Brady could end up paying $21,500 in taxes for winning the 2015 Chevy Colorado and giving it to Butler

Brady and Butler celebrated their Super Bowl win with a rolling rally on the streets of Boston yesterday

Butler's interception in the final seconds of the Super Bowl helped secure the Patriots fourth world title 

The fun doesn't stop there for the four-time Super Bowl winner.

Brady's game check after winning the Super Bowl is somewhere in the range of $97,000.

He will be taxed at the top rate of 39.6 per cent on his check and will also have to pay Medicare tax. 

The former sixth-round draft pick will end up paying about $42,000 in federal taxes on the game. 

The $63,500 Brady may have to fork over seems a small price to pay for becoming the G.O.A.T. (greatest of all time) in the eyes of many football fans.

It also just a small fraction of the $19million salary he collected in 2014. He is due to make an almost $30million over the next three seasons in salary alone, according to Spotrac.
