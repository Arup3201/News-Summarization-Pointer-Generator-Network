Nearly 200 men taken as Prisoners of War during the Vietnam conflict are gathering this week at the Nixon Presidential Library to mark the 40th anniversary of their release.

The veterans, most of whom served as pilots, are reuniting at the presidential memorial in Yorbalinda, California to commemorate their return to the U.S. in 1973 after years of torture at the hands of the North Vietnamese. 

This Friday, the Nixon Library is recreating the star-studded event President Richard Nixon hosted at The White House on May 24, 1973 to celebrate their homecoming - the largest dinner party ever held at the Executive Mansion.

Homecoming: President Richard Nixon gives a thumbs up as he welcomes an audience of 450 former POWs and their guests to the White House on May 24, 1973 to celebrate their release

Celebration: President Nixon and his wife Pat joined Irving Berlin and other entertainers on stage in 1973 to sing 'God Bless America' in celebration of the release of the prisoners

Excitement: POWs cheer in March 1973 as they are flown from the Gia Lam Airport in Hanoi back to the U.S. following their release

Grateful nation: John McCain, now a Republican Senator from Arizona, spent 5 years in a Vietnamese prison. In Sept. 1973 he was greeted by President Richard Nixon, left, in Washington

Torture: John McCain, a Navy pilot, was held at the Maison Centrale prison in Hanoi that was dubbed 'The Hanoi Hilton.' He was severely injured in captivity and he is still unable to lift his arms above his head

Nearly 600 men in total were taken by the North Vietnamese as prisoners during the war. 

After years of fighting and agonizing 
negotiations, Nixon ordered the Christmas bombings in 1972.

That offensive paved the way for Nixon's Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to negotiate the January 1973 peace accords that called for a cease-fire and 
the release of prisoners, some of whom had been in captivity for nearly six years.

In celebration of their freedom, President Nixon splashed on a star-studded bash - the largest dinner party held on the grounds of The White House with 1,300 guests descending on the South Lawn.

A giant tent, that was longer and wider than The White House itself, was erected to accommodate the crowd, with 126 round tables set up for the guests.

Bob Hope, John Wayne and Sammy Davis 
Jr. were among the A-listers at the celebration, on hand to welcome the heroes home.

Irving Berlin was also in attendance 
and he performed 'God Bless America,' a tune that warmed the heart of 
the Americans who were so grateful to return home to their families.

The meal included All-American fare of sirloin steak, fingerling potatoes and strawberry mousse, items the prisoners dreamed of during their time in captivity.

Guests: Richard Nixon's eldest daughter Patricia Nixon Cox, second from right in 2009 with her husband Ed, her son Chris Cox, left, and his wife Andrea Catsimatidis, second from left, will attend the Friday gala

The Nixon Presidential Library opened an exhibit on May 18 to commemorate the 40 year anniversary of the POW release, 'An All-American Homecoming,' that features memorabilia from the monumental event.

Thursday night, a motorcade will escort the former POWs, coming to the library for the anniversary event, to the Nixon museum for a BBQ dinner and reunion kickoff.

On Friday, the Nixon Presidential Foundation is hosting a formal dinner, at the California library's replica of the White House East Room, to recreate the historic 1973 dinner party.

The POWs who attended the original dinner have been invited to attend. The program includes an address by Republican California Rep. Ed Royce, Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and comments from Texas billionaire and former presidential candidate Ross Perot. 

Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger will also provide video tributes to the guests.

Arizona
Republican Senator John McCain was among the 591 POWs released in 1973 but 
he will not be able to attend the dinner on Friday night.

Members of the Nixon family will be in attendance, including eldest daughter Tricia Nixon Cox and her son and daughter-in-law, Christopher Nixon Cox and Andrea Catsimatidis.

Richard Nixon's only surviving brother, Ed Nixon, will also be among the guests.

During the program, a choir made up of POWs will sing a special song they composed during their harrowing captivity.

At the 1973 dinner, 40 members participated singing the song and at the dinner on Friday, 18 original members of the chorus will be on hand to sing.

Though the event came as Nixon was embroiled in the Watergate scandal, the men who were suffering in captivity abroad still praise the 37th president for his efforts to secure their freedom.

'He was a hero to us,' retired U.S. Marine Capt. Orson Swindle, who spent six years and four months in Hanoi prison camps, told the Associated Press.

'He will always be revered by us as a group because he got us home, and we didn't know how we were going to get home.'

Retired U.S. Navy officer Mike McGrath, who was just 27 when his plane was shot down during a 1967 bombing mission in Vietnam, remembers the glamor of the White House celebration and the president's gracious hospitality.

'The president and his wife said goodnight at midnight, but he said, "You can dance all night long,"' the veteran told the AP about the affair at the Executive Mansion.

'What an evening, to dance until the band quits and have free run of the White House,' the man, who spent nearly 6 years in a POW camp, remembered.
