A 40-year-old single malt whisky is to go on sale at a budget supermarket chain.

Aldi is predicting queues of eager shoppers to snake out of the doors as 3,000 bottles of the bargain whisky, made at a Scottish distillery in 1971, go on sale across its 450 UK stores on 8 December.

Aldi said today it is the first supermarket to sell a whisky of this age and expects it to sell out within hours. The whisky will cost just £49.99 a bottle.

Bargain: Aldi is the first supermarket ever to sell a 40-year-old whisky. The hotly anticipated Glenbridge aged single malt will be on sale for just £49.99, despite being worth around £300

A spokesman for the supermarket said: 'Whisky of this quality and age would usually sell for around £300 plus.

'Aldi is giving customers the chance to get hold of a very high quality luxury product for a very low price.'

He added that he would not be surprised to see the whisky appearing for sale on eBay with customers taking advantage of the discount price.

Drink up: Aldi will also stock a 24 year-old Glen Marnoch single malt for £29.99 from 24 November

The limited edition Speyside Single Malt Whisky comes from an unnamed Scottish distillery.

The taste is described as 'intense and rich... with an aroma of dark chocolate and dried figs, the sweet taste gives off a marmalade zestiness, and the dry oak tannins fade into a lingering sweet and mellow finish'.

A second bottle, a Glen Marnoch 24-year-old single malt whisky, is also available in the store from November 24.

Good deal: Aldi says it is 'giving customers the chance to get hold of a very high quality luxury product for a very low price'
