Boston's mourners were handed a stunning development Thursday with news that a secret intelligence assessment, issued just five days before the Boston Marathon bombings, specifically warned that the finish line area was an 'area of increased vulnerability' for terrorist bombers.

The report, now eerie in its accuracy, raised alarms over fears that terrorists could execute 'small scale bombings' aimed at killing both marathon runners and spectators near the race's end point.

Two officials read portions of the 18-page report to a reporter in the Los Angeles Times' Boston bureau, according to the paper.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis told members of the House Homeland Security Committee that the FBI never shared information about Tamerlan Tsarnaev with his agency

Former U.S. Senator Joseph Lieberman (L) said local law enforcement is the 'first line of defense' against terror plots, and criticized the feds for holding back information

The 'Joint Special Event Assessment' was issued on April 10, and concluded that there was 'no credible, specific information indicating an imminent threat' to anyone running or attending the race.

That assessment, according to the LA Times, included a caution that 'The FBI has not identified any specific lone offender or extremist group who pose a threat to the Boston marathon.'

But the organization that prepared it, the Boston Regional Intelligence Center, is linked by its funding to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) - not to the Department of Justice, which is the FBI's parent organization.

Questions remain about how much credible intelligence DHS had on the principal bombing suspect, the late Tamerlan Tsarnaev, before he and his brother detonated two shrapnel-laden pressure-cooker bombs, killing three and injuring hundreds.

Boston Marathon runners were devastated after two bombs exploded near the finish line on April 15. A report cited by the Los Angeles Times indicates that Boston terror-trackers considered the marathon's finish line a high-risk target

Flowers and teddy bears dominated an impromptu memorial site in Boston's Copley Square, near the site of the April 15 bombings. Tamerlan Tsarnaev (R) and his brother Dzokhar are the accused bombings. Tamerlan was killed in a shootout with police just days after the bombings

Russia's government gave the United States specific intelligence about Tsarnaev and his terrorist sympathies in 2011. And a high-ranking Saudi official has told MailOnline that his government warned the U.S. about Tsarnaev in 2012 after denying him an entry visa in December 2011, although DHS and the Saudi embassy in Washington have issued denials about that report.

Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis told a congressional panel on Thursday morning that his department was never told about the Tsarnaev brothers.

'We would have liked to have known,' Davis testified in a House Homeland Security Committee hearing, but 'we were not aware of the two brothers. We were not aware of their activities.'

Boston police, he said, weren't aware they existed until three days after the bombings.

'We didn't look at the brothers until after the shootout' that claimed Tamerlan's life, he said.

Ten days after the Boston bombings, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly announced that the Tsarnaev brothers planned to bomb Times Square. Federal agencies did not share that information with New York City officials until long after the information could have made a difference

Anguish: First responders helped a screaming man into an ambulance - one of more than 200 who were injured in the bombings. Three others died, including an 8-year-old boy

'We would certainly have looked at the information' if federal law enforcement had provided it, Davis testified.

But the three officers he had assigned to Boston's Joint Terrorism Task Force said later that they were never in the loop.

'They tell me they received no word about that individual prior to the bombing,' Davis told the committee.

In the hearing, New York Republican Rep. Peter King slammed federal law enforcement for failing to share information with authorities in Boston and New York, where the FBI was aware the Tsarnaev brothers intended to detonate more bombs in Times Square.

'The failure to share information is absolutely indefensible,' said King.

Lieberman applauded the Boston police chief, but slammed the federal government for failing to share information with city and state authorities

Former Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman, a former chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, testified that DHS and the FBI should share a broader variety of information with state and local law enforcement agencies, calling them 'your first line of defense.'

Not sharing all the federal government's information with Boston police, he said, was 'a serious and aggravating omission.'

He called that lapse 'one of the most significant and painful takeaway lessons' from the federal government's response to the bombings.
