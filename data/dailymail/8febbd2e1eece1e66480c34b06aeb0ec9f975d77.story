This is the moment a robber narrowly escaped a flying stepladder when it was thrown at him during an armed raid on a phone shop.

The masked thief was one of two people who burst into a mobile phone shop in Burnley, Lancashire, where they threatened the owner, Mohammad Jabar on New Year's Day.

They could not open the till but managed to take an iPhone and a BlackBerry. One of the pair was chased out of the shop by Mr Jabar, 62, who then locked the door from the inside, trapping his assailant inside.

It
 was then that his nephew, Imran Mehmood, 27, threw the stepladder at 
the second thief who went on to smash the glass door to escape.

Mr Mehmood said: 'I threw a stepladder at him to try and stop him smashing the glass, but I missed.

'I couldn’t try to stop him another way because I thought he might use the knife against me.

'It was very frightening. It all happened very fast, within two minutes.

Entrance: The men made their way into the shop before revealing knives and stealing two phones

Mr Jabar, who has run the shop called Sana Com for five years, said: 'When they came in they were shouting and swearing.

'I was worried they were going to use the knives. We didn’t argue with them. It was very frightening.

'One of them tried to get into the till but didn’t manage it.

'There are lots of buttons on it and he didn’t know which one would open it.

'Then he grabbed an iPhone and a Blackberry from underneath the counter, and maybe another phone too.

'I recognised him and I told him "I know you", which made him angry. I’ve seen him around town.

Target: The robbers made an attempt on Sana Communications in Burnley, Lancashire, and stole two phones

'Then
 he went out the shop and I went after him and closed the door from the 
outside so the other one couldn’t get out before the police got here.

'But
 he started trying to break his way out, kicking the glass in the door, 
smashing it until he made a big hole and then got out.'

Mr Mehmood said: 'We never argue with people. Everybody knows and likes my uncle and we never have trouble.

'I would never have thought this would happen because we’ve got eight security cameras in the shop.'

Mr
 Jabar said: 'I’ve lived and worked in Burnley as a builder for 45 
years. People are friendly. We’ve never had anything like this happen 
before.

'But we are hearing about more of these types of robberies in the area. People being threatened with knives. It is worrying.'

A spokesman for Lancashire Constabulary said: 'There was a robbery on New 
Year’s Day between 5.50pm and 5.55pm at Sana Com in Colne Road.

'Two offenders with their faces covered entered the premises and produced a knife and threatened the shopkeeper.

'They attempted to enter the till, didn’t manage it, and stole some mobile phones before leaving through the front door.'
