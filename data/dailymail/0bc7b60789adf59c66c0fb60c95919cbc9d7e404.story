To borrow the words of Robin van Persie, this match was like a ‘poker game’ for Guus Hiddink.

The Holland coach had in effect held a gun to his own head, promising to resign after just 72 days at the helm if his team failed to beat Latvia in this European Championship qualifier.

But Hiddink knew he had a strong hand and in Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben, Wesley Sneijder and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, four genuine aces.

Man of the Match: Arjen Robben

The quartet ran amok at the Amsterdam ArenA as Holland put their recent troubles to one side with a comfortable win - but it did come at a price for Manchester United.

Daley Blind, the midfielder who has performed so consistently well for them this season, hobbled off injured after 20 minutes after colliding with Eduards Visnakovs and taking a blow to the knee.

He is now a doubt for Saturday’s trip to Arsenal as Louis van Gaal’s injury nightmare grows ever worse. It will be a threadbare United side that lines up at the Emirates, with Blind’s injury adding to a casualty list that already includes David de Gea, Marcos Rojo, Phil Jones, Jonny Evans and Michael Carrick.

His withdrawal didn’t affect Holland too badly, however. At least Van Persie’s early header gave Van Gaal something to smile about and they asserted a clear dominance over their visitors with goals from Robben - a 25-yard worldie - and Huntelaar before the break.

Jeffrey Bruma turned in a Van Persie flick-on 12 minutes from time to add some gloss to the scoreline, Robben powered in a fifth and Huntelaar drilled home No 6 in the final minute.

More pertinently, this second win in qualifying Group A lifts the pressure on Hiddink, who was on the brink after four defeats in his first five matches since succeeding Van Gaal after the World Cup.

The former Chelsea boss can breathe easy, at least until they play Turkey at the end of March. 

Hiddink shuffled his pack and brought the game-winning cards to the fore. Van Persie, who sat out Wednesday’s match with Mexico, tucked in behind Huntelaar with Robben and Afellay stationed either side of him. Blind started as a defensive shield, asked to curb his natural attacking instincts.

Neither the dismal recent form - nor the lousy Amsterdam weather - failed to dampen the spirit of the Oranje fans, who created a right din ahead of kick-off as techno tunes pumped out of the PA system and into the enclosed ArenA.

The players responded, attacking with a high tempo from the first whistle. On two minutes, Van Persie controlled the ball inside the box and nudged it wide to Afellay, who curled his shot against the upright. 

Moments later and they had the lead, settling the nerves of Hiddink and the entire stadium. Robben, as he would be allowed to all evening, found space down the left and placed his cross right on Van Persie’s head for the most straightforward of finishes.

In contrast to his patchy recent form for United, this was Van Persie’s 18th goal in 25 national team appearances and his 49th in orange colours overall.

Feeling more relaxed, Holland continued to pour forward at will. Robben again collected possession in the right-hand channel, cut inside two defenders, and fired into the side-netting.

On the quarter-hour, Van Persie touched on to Huntelaar - the forward pair combining well as Hiddink had hoped - and the ball wormed its way to Afellay, whose low drive was saved by former Crystal Palace keeper Aleksandrs Kolinko.

There was a moment of alarm when Janis Ikaunieks found the unmarked Valerijs Sabala inside the area, but the Latvian headed over when well-placed.

The injury to Blind killed Holland’s momentum and their chances dried up until the final 10 minutes of the half.

Sneijder, whose 74 successful passes in the opening period eclipsed the 56 of the entire Latvian team, found Van Persie pulling away at the back post but his header was easily saved.

It took a moment of wonder from Robben to awaken the game from its slumber. Collecting the ball wide right, he cut inside and curled the ball left-footed and into the top corner from 25 yards. Kolinko gawped at it as it flew past him, unable to influence the perfect trajectory achieved by the Bayern Munich man’s boot.

And three minutes from the break, Hiddink could truly rest easy when Huntelaar ghosted in front of his marker and stuck out a foot to turn Afellay’s low cross past Kolinko. It was a fitting reflection of Dutch dominance.

It took Holland a good 10 minutes to get back into their stride after half-time, with Van Persie again testing Kolinko with a header from Robben’s flighted free-kick.

And the winger curled his next set-piece against the post a couple of minutes later as Holland threatened a fourth, while a shot from an impossibly tight angle following another marauding run was somehow kept out by the goalkeeper.

It was, at times, the Robben show and after he’d seen another couple of efforts blocked, his 78th-minute corner was flicked on by Van Persie at the near post and turned in by former Chelsea man Bruma for 4-0.

And as if he hadn’t done enough to earn the man of the match accolade, Robben slammed home No 5 as well. Huntelaar rounded off the rout with a neat spin inside the box and a low finish under the keeper.
