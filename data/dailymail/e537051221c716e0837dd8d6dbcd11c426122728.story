An 11-year-old girl found wandering alone and disoriented in China was the victim of horrifying abuse at the hands of her father, it has emerged.

The young girl's mouth had been stitched up with fishing cord and her head submerged in boiling water, her skin had been pierced with sewing needles, and she had been hung upside down and beaten, according to reports.

The girl, named as Xiao Li, who is now recovering in hospital, has scars all over her body and chunks of hair are missing from her scalded scalp.

Torture: Details of the horrific abuse the girl suffered have emerged from Shichang in China

Local news reports in China said the girl was talking to herself and occasionally shouting abuse at passersby when a man approached her on May 8.

The man, named as Mr Fu, discovered the girl was missing hair and was covered in scars, a Sky News report said.

Villagers told Mr Fu the girl's name was Xiao Li, and that she had suffered abuse at the hands of her father, named only as Yang.

Mr Fu contacted police and Yang was arrested. Through a combination of ensuing medical examinations and police interviews with Yang officers have pieced together the nightmare ordeal the 11-year-old girl suffered.

Photographs of the little girl, who was made to kneel on a floor covered in shards of broken glass, reveal fresh wounds alongside scars left behind from old injuries.

Doctors fear she has been malnourished for much of her life, and suspect her hair will never grow back.

The girl's grandmother has said in an interview that her parents left home to find work shortly after Xiao Li was born.

She was looked after by her grandparents for five years before her father returned and the abuse began.

The grandmother claimed she was aware of the abuse but powerless to stop it, and said her son Yang abused her as well as her granddaughter.

Police in China were made aware of the incident when the little girl's head was plunged into boiling water.

Yang is said to have told officers he was trying to rid his daughter of head lice. He was ordered to take his daughter to hospital, but police did not pursue the matter further.

The 11-year-old is recovering in hospital in China, where the costs of her medical treatment have been waived.

Government officials in the area say they are seeking guardians to take care of Xiao Li as her grandparents are now to old to care for her, the Sky News report said.
