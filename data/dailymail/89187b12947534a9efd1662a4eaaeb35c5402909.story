David Luiz might insist Jose Mourinho isn't all that, but his club think differently after offering Paris Saint-Germain's stars a staggering £180,000 per man if they beat Chelsea.

The French champions travel to Stamford Bridge needing to score in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against the Blues.

Edinson Cavani equalised at the Parc de Princes after Branislav Ivanovic had given Chelsea a lead three weeks ago.

And, if they manage to progress on leaving the capital, PSG will pay out 250,000 euros to each of the squad.

The Qatari owners are using their mammoth wealth to offer incentives to a team that has reached the quarter-finals in both of the last two seasons.

With that in mind, Laurent Blanc's side will scoop 1m euros (£716,000) each should they win Europe's premier competition.

That though hinges on whether they are capable of negotiating a tricky away leg. West London was the scene in April last year when PSG blew a two-goal first leg lead and crashed out of the competition – Demba Ba scoring a late winner to put Chelsea through on away goals.

PSG's players have already pocketed 100,000 euros (£71,600) a man for getting out of their group, with that to rise to 450,000 euros for a semi-final berth and 700,000 if they compete in the Berlin final on June 6.
