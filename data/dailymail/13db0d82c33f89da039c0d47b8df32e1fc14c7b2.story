The Islamic State have released a new propaganda video glorifying a sniper carrying out a series of deadly assassinations in an attempt to respond to publicity surrounding Hollywood blockbuster American Sniper.

The footage is said to be a bid to rival the Oscar nominated film, which tells the story of Chris Kyle, the most lethal marksman in U.S. military history.

But despite his apparent fame and success, the ISIS sniper's identity is deliberately hidden and his alleged kill record remains private.

The ISIS sniper, whose identity is deliberately hidden, who features in a new propaganda video has the terror group respond to the Hollywood blockbuster American Sniper 

The only known detail about the shooter is that all of his kills are said to have taken place in eastern Syria 

The only known detail about the shooter is that his kills are all said to have been in the Deir Ezzor province in eastern Syrian.

Much of the three and a half minute video is based around supposed footage from a sniper's nest. 

It shows the alleged assassination of 12 opposition fighters in grainy footage caused by apparent over zooming by the cameraman.

Computer graphics have been added to some of the supposed distant kills, shown through a computer generated rifle scope.

The video opens by giving detailed information about the sniper’s Russian made Dragonov rifle, referring to its firing range and shooting capabilities.

Many of the assassinations are accompanied with an action replay, with several of the death being shown in reverse slow motion 

Some of the assassinations are met with a loud cry of ‘God is Great’ in Arabic, possibly said by the sniper’s spotter.

The spotter also refers to someone called Khalid, possibly revealing the identity of the mystery sniper.

Some of the footage is such poor quality that the editor has been forced to highlight the location of the unsuspecting victim, prior to their death. A red box has been used to indicate the grainy shadow of an unfortunate victim.

The supposed sharpshooter is also shown twice missing one of his targets.

In one scene, an opposition soldier is filmed running among some trees before a loud gunshot goes off.

He continues to run, zig zagging, as he advances and manages to avoid another of the sniper’s rounds.

Possibly perplexed by his failure to twice hit his intended target, the sniper is shown adjusting his scope all for dramatic effect.

Two more ‘kills’ are the also shown, starting with the solider whom the sniper twice failed to kill.

The sniper also appears to fail to shoot another soldier standing in the background in the final assassination scene.
