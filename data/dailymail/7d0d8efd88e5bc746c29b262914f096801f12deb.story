New laws may be needed to ‘civilise the internet’, protect private lives and prevent ‘mob rule’, Lord Justice Leveson has suggested.

The judge, speaking in public for the first time since his 2,000-page report into the Press was published, launched a broadside against the prospect of people facing ‘trial by Twitter’.

Critics have suggested that the Leveson report’s recommendations risk shackling a shrinking print media while doing nothing to address a ‘Wild West’ online culture in which innocent people’s reputations are trashed every day.

Speaker: During a £620-per-ticket lecture in Sydney last night Lord Justice Leveson said 'mob rule' online needed to be dealt with

Speech: Lord Leveson said that the internet had become a 'megaphone for gossip' that would need new laws to control it

Only one short chapter of the report 
tackles ‘alternative news sources’, including broadcasters and the 
internet. Only one-and-a-half pages are devoted to issues of 
‘enforcement’ raised by the web.

Lord Justice Leveson said there was a
perception ‘on the internet that actions do not have legal 
consequences’, unlike newspapers which must follow the rules.

One of the abuses he mentioned was 
the publication of topless photos of the Duchess of Cambridge in a 
French magazine, which were not printed in the British Press but could 
be easily viewed online.

'Unmissable': Lord Justice Leveson was among a host of experts to speak at the day-long symposium, billed as 'one of the key privacy events of the year'

Example: A hoax phone call to Kate's bedside (pictured leaving hospital) was an example of the need for new privacy laws, Lord Leveson said

Lord Justice Leveson was the keynote 
speaker at a conference on privacy and the internet in Australia, where 
he travelled soon after the publication of his report last week.

Pressure: Lord Leveson has been criticised for the lack of detail on his 2,000 page report on how to deal with the internet

He told
guests paying £620 each that he was monitoring developments in London 
‘with interest’ but refused to comment any further on his most 
contentious recommendation for a new watchdog to be underpinned by law.

However, he did finally address the 
problems posed by the internet, which he called a ‘global megaphone for 
gossip’, saying online allegations cause ‘permanent’ damage as they 
remain in cyberspace.

The judge suggested there was ‘an 
element of mob rule’ – seemingly referring to false allegations against 
Tory peer Lord McAlpine that emerged following a report on the BBC’s 
Newsnight programme.

‘The established media broadly 
conforms to the law and, when they do not, they are potentially liable 
under the law,’ he said.

‘In so far as the internet is concerned, there 
has been – and for many there remains – a perception that actions do not
have legal consequences.

'There is not only a danger of trial by 
Twitter, but also of an unending punishment, and no prospect of 
rehabilitation, by Google.’

His remarks, at the University of 
Technology in Sydney, came as newspaper editors announced they had 
agreed to put in place the broad principles of his report for a tough 
new regulator, with the power to issue fines of up to £1million, order 
the publication of prominent apologies and investigate alleged 
wrongdoing – but without involving statute.
