An online children's shop has sparked outrage by selling T-shirts that Twitter users describe as 'sexist'.

Children's clothing e-tailer The Children's Place is offering T-shirts for little girls with slogans such as 'Born to wear diamonds', but ones for young boys with statements such as 'Superhero' - and they haven't gone down well on the web.

Laura Beck wrote on Jezebel.com: 'There's nothing wrong with being All 
About Glitter - but when you start marketing garbage to little girls 
that's all DIAMONDS RULE, MATH DROOLS, you're officially a sh*** 
company.

Girls vs boys: These T-shirts sold on The Children's Place have sparked outrage on the net because of their 'sexist' slogans

'By contrast, their boys T-shirts are all
 about surfing and playing drums and being a superhero.

'They're by no 
means perfect, but they paint the picture of a pro-active kid putting 
himself out there and making things happen. If the company doesn't want 
to mix all the shirts together - boys and girls basically have the same 
bodies at those ages, why can't they choose for themselves?'

The T-shirts, which are priced at around £8 ($12) each, also feature a girl's top with a check-list that reads: 'My best subjects: Shopping, music, dancing' with a tick by each and then: 'Math (well, nobody's perfect) without a tick by it.

Offensive: The T-shirts have caused offence to web users, with one saying: 'When you start marketing garbage to little girls that's all DIAMONDS RULE, MATH DROOLS, you're officially a sh*** company'

The boys range, however, features T-shirts saying: 'I was born to ride' and 'winning runs in my family'.

One user wrote on Babycentre.com: 'Something that continually disturbs me about these articles involving sexist T-shirts for kids is that they all seem to be at lower end retailers - J.C. Penney's, the Children's Place, etc.

'I'm not saying they're okay anywhere or that they don't exist everywhere, but it's interesting to me that these are being directly sold to and affecting disproportionately girls on the lower socioeconomic end of the spectrum - the ones that are already statistically more likely to achieve lower education levels, get pregnant earlier, be victims of abuse, etc.'

Whilst Twitter users added comments such as 'Another place not to shop', 'Don't worry if you're not good at math #genderbias' and 'more sexist crap for your kids'.

The Canadian-based company, that also sell children's shoes, accessories and baby clothes, ship worldwide and have an outlet at Union Square.

The Children's Place has been contacted by MailOnline for a comment.

Different messages: One web user pointed out that the boy's T-shirts paint the picture of an active kid putting himself out there but is less than impressed with the girl's version

All together: One Jezebel writer says the T-shirts should all be advertised together so children can choose what they want to wear, yet the site clearly markets them separately

Not happy: Twitter users have given their opinion on the children's T-shirts
