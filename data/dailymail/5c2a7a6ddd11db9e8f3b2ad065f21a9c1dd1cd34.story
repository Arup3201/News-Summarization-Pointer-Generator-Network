Andrea Faustini may be a finalist in X-Factor but his own family have claimed he has no hope of winning the competition - because the British public are too nationalistic to vote for an Italian.

Speaking from the family home in the suburbs of Rome, the talented singer’s father, Adolfo Faustini, said he is already preparing for the worst because '[the English] won't vote for a foreigner'.

In this Saturday’s final Andrea faces stiff competition from homegrown talent Fleur and Ben, who have been garnering local support this week as their tour the UK on their Battle Buses.

Meanwhile Andrea’s friends and extended family back in Rome can’t watch the show or vote using the phone lines.

Mr Faustini, who works for the bank Unicredit, admitted to Mail Online he was preparing for the worst, as he opened up the family album to reveal a cherubic Andrea.

‘I don't think that he will win. He is fantastic. But at the end of the day the English will vote for someone English when it comes to the final. They won't vote for a foreigner. They are too nationalistic.'

But if his father's predictions are proved right and his singing career then fails to take off, Andrea already has a 'plan B' - moving into business in China.

Adolfo said: 'Here in Italy there is no work for young people. We have always known that our two children will have to go away and work abroad.That's why Andrea is studying Chinese.'

'If he doesn't have a musical career he will first study and then go and work in China, that was the plan. He understands something of business.'

And like every proud family, Adolfo and his sister, Andrea's aunt, can't resist adding one or two facts about the star that will no doubt make the singer cringe - he loved playing with Spice Girl dolls almost as much as eating.

The finalist - dubbed 'teddy bear' by former Spice Girl mentor Mel B - has faced criticism over his weight been forced to deny reports that he has been put on a diet by X-Factor producers. He was reportedly given a ‘biscuit ban’ and ordered to eat healthily.

Aunt Anna Faustini, who runs a restaurant on the coast near Rome, says: 'Andrea loves to eat. He is very quiet. His sister is a comedian by contrast. He is always happy and quiet. When he goes on the stage he sings but when he is not on the stage he is quite quiet. He doesn't talk that much round the table. He eats!'

Father Adolfo adds: 'He and Elena always played with her Spice Girls dolls. She was more keen on them than him obviously but they also had a video of the Spice Girls which they both loved and would watch it all the time and dance to it. In this way they learnt all the words to the songs.'

Bursting with pride at his son's achievements, Adolfo proudly shows off pictures of Andrea as baby - already showing his unique dress sense with a Yogi Bear jumper. 

The tot-sized Andrea is already showing signs of a fondness for his food, as demonstrated by his beautiful chubby cheeks.

His aunt Anna Faustini and uncle Luciano, who run a seafood restaurant La Murena on the coast near Rome, said he has always loved his food.

‘The whole family come to our restaurant all the time. And they come to our house for Christmas. But Andrea doesn’t talk as much as the rest of the family. He’s quite quiet really when he’s not singing. He just eats.’

His favourite dishes are risotto with cream and langoustines made by his uncle, followed by Fruits of the forest marmalade pie made by his aunt Anna. ‘He doesn’t eat the whole thing but he generally has enough for two people’, she said.

Anna, who is flying over for to watch the final on Saturday with other family members, shares her brother Adolfo’s worries.

She said: ‘He won’t win, it’s true. He was the favourite all the way along but now even the bookies are saying that he won’t get the votes.

‘If you’re British and given the choice to vote Andrea or for Ben or Fleur, who are both British, who are you going to choose? ‘

With the final just around the corner, the finalists have been pulling out all the stops to whip up the maximum amount of support.

But while his counterparts headed back to their hometowns, Andrea’s tour bus did not get to do a homecoming concert in Rome. 

He toured London instead, stopping off at San Carlo Cicchetti restaurant in St James to meet Italian TV chef Aldo Zilli and at Leicester Square, where producers had laid on an Italian themed event.

Learning Chinese: Andrea is studying Chinese and Korean in preparation for a future business career if his singing does not take off after X-Factor 

Dressed in a sharp black tuxedo, he performed at the Royal Albert Hall for the Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research’s Christmas With The Stars introduced by his mentor Mel B.

His family believe that decision to remain in London for his ‘homecoming’ was taken ‘because people in Italy cannot vote’ in the English competition, ‘and because it’s too far to come of course. It would take forever,’ Aunt Anna explains. 

If rejected by the British public it will be heartbreaking for Andrea because he turned down Italian X-Factor this year in favour of the British show - because he loves British music, his dad says. ‘If he chose 20 favourite songs 19 would be in English’.

His CD collection at home includes British star Adele as well as Americans such as Katy Perry and Mariah Carey. When he was growing up he and his sister Elena would watch the Spice Girls DVD over and over, doing the dance moves and learning the words to all the songs, he remembers. ‘They had the Spice Girls dolls too, as everyone now knows.’

Even if he does win. Andrea already has experienced the high of a music competition and found that it doesn’t always make all your dreams come true, his dad explains. ‘He has already been through it once on Ti Lascio una Canzone [The Italian talent TV show Andrea performed in aged 14. ‘He did very well in that but it didn’t change anything . Afterwards life went back to normal.’ 

But if Britain doesn’t prove the Faustinis wrong by voting for Andrea he may have to leave them far behind. His father says if he doesn’t make a music career for himself, he will have to move to China.

‘We will miss him. But we miss him even in London. ‘
