Arrested: Double murder suspect James Allen was held in south Leeds at 7.20am today after a nationwide search

A fugitive being hunted over two murders was arrested yesterday after he was spotted by an off-duty policeman and chased through the streets.

Detectives started a nationwide search for James Allen last Thursday in connection with the deaths of Colin Dunford, 81, and Julie Davison, 50.

Both were battered over the head while at home alone.

The 36-year-old suspect was recognised in the centre of Leeds at 7.20am by a policeman driving to work to start his shift.

He immediately called for back-up and continued to watch Allen from his car. A small team of officers arrived ‘within minutes’ and they moved in to make the arrest.

Detective Chief Superintendent Gordon Lang, of Cleveland Police, said there was a short chase on foot before Allen was held, handcuffed and taken for questioning.

Mr Lang expressed concern about the suspect’s movements over the past few days.

‘It’s very important to fill in the details of where he has been and who he has come across,’ the police chief said.

‘If you haven’t seen or heard from your neighbour lately or you notice anything unusual about their house, please pay them a visit to check up on them.’

Mr Dunford was found dead at 10.50pm last Monday at his home in Middlesbrough. Charity worker Mrs Davison was found dead on Wednesday at her flat 25 miles away in Whitby.

A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said Allen was arrested on Crown Point Road after an off-duty officer saw a man fitting his description.

Assistant Chief Constable Mark 
Milsom, of West Yorkshire Police, said: 'An off-duty officer travelling 
to work this morning saw a man fitting the description of James Allen on
Crown Point Road in Leeds.

'They called for colleagues in support who arrived quickly and an arrest was made.

'We would like to thank all members of the community who have been contacting us to assist in this matter.'

An urgent appeal to find Allen was 
issued by Cleveland Police and North Yorkshire Police following the 
murders of Mrs Davison, 50 and 
81-year-old Mr Dunford.

West Yorkshire Police joined the 
search after Allen was seen on CCTV footage walking along Harehills Lane
at 2.41pm on Friday.

At that point, police said it was 
possible Allen had already gone to a different location and urged anyone
who saw him to call 999.

Police said Allen was considered 
dangerous and members of the public were advised not to approach him, but to
contact police immediately.

Police also released CCTV images of Allen in Scarborough earlier this week.

The pictures showed Allen in a cash exchange in the seaside town on Tuesday and Wednesday and in a sports shop on Wednesday.

Temporary Detective Chief 
Superintendent Gordon Lang said the images showed Allen could be trying 
to change his appearance by growing his hair.

Mr Lang confirmed Allen stayed in a 
bed and breakfast, thought to be the Allerton Croft Hotel in 
Scarborough, on Wednesday night.

Sunday, April 29 - Allen, 36, is arrested in south Leeds at 7.20am and held on suspicion of murder.

The detective said Cleveland Police 
had received hundreds of calls in response to appeals and urged anyone 
with information or anyone sheltering Allen to contact them.

'This is not a time for loyalty. There 
can be no loyalty at a time like this. This is the time to help the 
police,' he said. 'Now is the time to be public-spirited.'

Det Chf Sup Lang issued a further direct appeal
to Allen to hand himself in: 'Give yourself up. Give yourself up now.

'You need to be in police custody, you know you need to be in police 
custody, you know what you've done.

'I think purely and simply by the 
tragic events that have unfolded, this is a man who cannot be at large, 
who needs to be arrested and that needs to happen as quickly as 
possible.'

Mr Lang warned residents to keep their homes secure and be careful when answering their doors.

Mr Dunford, who was last seen alive at
around 5pm last Sunday, was found dead with serious head injuries at 
his terraced house in Leven Street, Middlesbrough, on Monday after he 
failed to appear at Samuelsons Working Man's Club, where he was a daily 
visitor.

Detectives said there was no sign of forced entry at the house.

Ms Davison, who lived alone, was found
dead by her sister at her rented flat in Church Square on Wednesday. She had also suffered serious head injuries, police said.
