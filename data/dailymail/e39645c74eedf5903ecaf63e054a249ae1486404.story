A dementia patient who was treated like a 'common criminal' when police handcuffed him at a care home died two months later after 'never recovering from his ordeal', his relatives claimed today.

The family of Keith Hyrons, 77, was arrested by West Mercia Police officers at Howbury House care home in Malvern, Worcestershire, after 'lashing out' at other patients.

His wife Valerie, 74, claims the grandfather-of-two was left 'terrified and shaken' by the 'brutish tactics' used by the officers and stopped eating after the ordeal.

The retired BT worker - who has suffered with Alzheimers for five years - lost half his body weight in two months and weighed just six stone when he passed away a different nursing home on November 8.

Yesterday his devastated family said they were '100 per cent sure' the incident with police had ultimately led to his death.

Mrs Hyrons, a retired nurse who was married to Mr Hyrons for 55 years, said: 'After he was handcuffed his condition really deteriorated.

'He was really shaken and terrified by what happened - I’m 100 per cent sure this is what caused him to get lower and lower.

'It was awful to watch, our family felt helpless as we just watched him slip away. He just have up after that incident with police.

'Because he stopped eating, he went from 12 stone to just six stone, he lost all that weight in about a month.

Incident: Mr Hyrons had been at Howbury House care home in Malvern, Worcestershire, for just a few hours when staff called police because he was 'lashing out' at other patients

'My husband was a caring and kind man 
and extremely popular, there were over 300 people at his funeral earlier
this month and he will be sorely missed by everyone.'

The pensioner had checked in at Howbury House after his wife took a trip to Spain to get some much needed rest from caring for her husband.

But within just hours of his arrival, the couple’s son Leighton, 40, was called to say his father was upsetting some residents.

Mrs Hyrons believes this was because 
dementia sufferers have a tendency to 'lash out' and the home should 
have been able to deal with it as they are medically trained.

After
being handcuffed, Mr Hyrons was then sectioned for 28 days at the 
Princess of Wales Hospital in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire.

He was transferred to Park House Nursing Home in Bewedly, Worcs., where he died.

The family has now called for police to receive better training for dealing with people with dementia or mental health issues.

Mrs Hyrons, from Kidderminster, Worcs., added: 'People in those sort of places are supposed to be looking after dementia sufferers.

'They should know what action to take, the family knew how to control him, although instead of calling us straight away they called the police.

'Officers came round and Keith was still agitated, they brutally restrained him by handcuffing him causing cuts on his wrists - they were way too heavy-handed.

'It was awful, it is a horrible thing to hear about the person you love.

'It is hard for me to imagine the pain he went through on that day, you don’t handcuff a 77-year-old man, it just isn’t right, although the police said they were in their rights to do so.

'There was no need for them to do what they did, it was too much for him, he was clearly confused being in new surroundings and needed to be cared for properly.

'People should know about dementia, it is common nowadays and people should know how to deal with it, not handcuff pensioners.

'I dropped my husband at that place so I could get some rest and they could care for him for a week.

'I wasn’t going to go away for years and years, just a week’s holiday.

'More people need to know about dementia and care home workers and police should be getting better training to deal with sufferers.'

A spokesman for West Merica Police said: 'I can confirm we have received a complaint regarding the handling of Mr Hyrons and we are investigating.'

Calling for change: Mr Hyrons' family are now calling for more police training on dealing with people with dementia and other mental health issues
