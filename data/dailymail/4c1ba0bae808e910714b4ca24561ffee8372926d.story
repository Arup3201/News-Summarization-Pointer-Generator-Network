Kanye West has proposed to girlfriend of 18 months Kim Kardashian days after telling the audience at his concert in Seattle on Saturday that he planned to marry her 'one day.'

The 36-year-old rapper popped the question to the reality star on her 33rd birthday on Monday with a 15 carat diamond ring at the AT&T Park baseball park in San Francisco, and later surprised her with family and friends pouring out of the dugouts, reports E!.

West had arranged for the words 'PLEEESE MARRY MEEE!!!' to flash up on the giant scoreboard.

In a snap posted on Instagram, Kim can be seen holding her ring finger towards the camera as she flashes her gigantic dazzling engagement band while smiling broadly alongside her man.

On Tuesday morning, the delighted new mother posted a black and white picture of her new bling in front of the romantic scoreboard message, with the simple caption: 'Yes!!!'

Kanye was in Los Angeles earlier in the day at the Hollywood Film Awards, and it was therefore unclear whether he planned to spend Kim's birthday with her.

The rapper flew in from San Francisco on Monday to present director Steve McQueen with a special honor award at the ceremony, and it appears he flew straight back to the Bay Area city straight afterwards to see the mother of his child.

Kim is said to have boarded a private jet that afternoon with her family in Los Angeles.

The band struck up the romantic ballad Young And Beautiful from film The Great Gatsby by songstress Lana Del Rey, followed by his own hit with Keri Hilson and Ne-Yo, Knock You Down.

The proposal left Kim speechless, for once.

'She was shocked and couldn't speak after,' a source a the scene told People magazine. 'Everyone had mascara running down their faces from tears.'

After Kim said yes, Kanye slipped a 15 carat diamond ring onto her finger and fireworks exploded in the sky as the rest of her family ran out of the dugouts.

He'd asked permission from the family matriarch for her daughter's hand in marriage earlier in the day.

Tobias Kormind, co-founder of specialist diamond jeweller 77 Diamonds, estimates Kim's dazzling ring is a cushion cut diamond, worth 'well over £1 million [$1.6m]'.

He told MailOnline: 'Kim's ring from Kanye looks like a 15 carat diamond Cushion cut. As its name suggests, the Cushion cut is a rectangular or square shape, with rounded corners that resemble a pillow.

Family unit: Kim and Kanye are now three with baby Nori, who was born on June 15

'It's very similar looking to the 
Emerald cut which [ex-husband] Kris Humphries gave her. I would have 
presumed that Kanye would have been keen to get her a different shape of
 ring this time, which is possibly why he chose the Cushion cut.

'I would estimate that a diamond of this size and quality would be worth well over £1 million; Kim is a very lucky woman!'

The couple's upcoming nuptials with be Kim's third marriage, and Kanye's first. After being friends for seven years, 
the pair first went public with their romance in April 2012.

Kim and Kanye - collectively known as 'Kimye' - quickly became inseparable and in December they announced they were expecting a child together, baby North, who was born on June 15.

Their love only blossomed, however, after the star's second marriage and most infamous relationship collapsed.

Kim caused a public outcry after she 
filed for divorce from her second husband Kris Humphries after just 72 days.

The reality star and the NBA player had 
tied the knot on August 20, 2011 and the wedding itself aired as a 
televised special in early October, just a few days Kim filed for 
divorce citing irreconcilable differences.

The pair duked it out in court and in the media but finally divorced this year.

The star had previously married music 
producer Damon Thomas at 19, only to get divorced three years later.

However, the wedding drama has already begun for the couple, with Kim's family said to be debating who will walk the star down the aisle when the pair eventually tie the knot.

Kim's father, lawyer Robert Kardashian, passed away in 2003, and Kris Jenner is now said to be keen for her son Rob to do the honours in the wake of her split from husband of 22 years, Bruce Jenner.

Who will do the honours? Kim's father, lawyer Robert Kardashian, passed away in 2003, and Kris Jenner is now said to be keen for her son Rob to walk Kim down the aisle in the wake of her recent split from  Bruce Jenner

A source exclusively told MailOnline: 'The drama starts here.

Kris thinks it should be 
Rob now [she and Bruce] are separated and thinks it might be bad form to
 ask Bruce after the Kris Humphries wedding, but Kim and the girls are 
backing Bruce, they still see him as their father.

'Kris says Bruce may not even want the 
heat after the last circus. And the couple themselves may want to avoid an extravagant event. At this rate Kim and Kanye could elope.'
