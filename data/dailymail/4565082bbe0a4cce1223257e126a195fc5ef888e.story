An Illinois high school has started random testing of drugs and alcohol in its students in a bid to stop students from taking the substances.

The private St Viator High School in Arlington Heights, Chicago, will start testing its students this week by taking hair samples.

Samples from 10 to 20 students will be chosen through random student ID selection by a third-party company each week, according to CBS Chicago.

New protocol: Students at the private St Viator High School in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights are now subject to weekly random drug and alcohol testing

No more boozing: The tests will show whether the students have had a beer or other type of alcohol in the past 90 days

No hiding: The tests will show if a student has smoked marijuana, left, in the past 90 days by taking a sample of their hair, right

School administrators say the tests will reveal if a student has had alcohol or used drugs like ecstasy, cocaine or marijuana in the past 90 days.

However, the test can't detect small amounts of alcohol, like sips of communion wine, according to The Daily Herald.

The results take about five days to come back, and if a student is found to be positive, the school plans to either discipline them or provide counselling.

Parents were informed of the new policy over the summer, with mixed reactions to the school's move.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is not particularly enthused either, saying it should be parents who have the responsibility of watching their children’s habits when they are not at school.

‘We have a mechanism for controlling the behavior of young people outside school — they're called parents,’ ACLU Illinois spokesman Ed Yohnka told the Tribune in August. 

Opponents: St. Viator Principal Reverend Corey Brost, left, says the students welcomed the test because it gives them an excuse to turn down drugs and alcohol. American Civil Liberties Union spokesman Ed Yohnka, right, says he doesn't think there is a 'need for schools to be acting as uber-parents'

‘I don't think we need for schools to be acting as uber-parents.’

However, St Viator is free to conduct the tests since they're a private institution.

St. Viator Principal Reverend Corey Brost says students welcome the tests because it gives them an excuse to turn down drugs and alcohol if it is offered to them.

‘We want to give kids a good reason to say, "No, I can't drink, St. Viator tests for alcohol",’ Brost told the Herald.

The school has randomly tested students for drugs since 2007, but the random tests for alcohol are new this year.
