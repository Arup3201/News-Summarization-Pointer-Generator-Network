Cleared: Dr Danuson Dharmasena has been cleared of carrying out female genital mutilation

A doctor who became the first person in the UK to stand trial over female genital mutilation was sensationally cleared yesterday.

A jury took fewer than 25 minutes to acquit Dhanuson Dharmasena of carrying out the potentially lethal procedure on a new mother.

He was cleared along with a co-defendant, 41-year-old Hasan Mohamed, whose lawyer said the verdict showed the failed case had been a Crown Prosecution Service ‘show trial’. 

Family and friends who had supported them throughout the two-week trial cried ‘yes’ as the verdicts were read out.

Dr Dharmasena had been accused of illegally stitching a 24-year-old woman back up after she gave birth, redoing the mutilation she suffered as a six-year-old in Somalia.

The prosecution had been hailed as a landmark in the campaign to stamp out the illegal practice. But Dr Dharmasena said he had simply put in a stitch to stop the woman bleeding after a traumatic emergency labour at Whittington Hospital in north London in 2012.

He said in a statement yesterday: ‘I am extremely relieved with the court’s verdict and I am grateful to the jury for their careful consideration of the facts.

‘I have always maintained that FGM is an abhorrent practice that has no medical justification

‘I would like to thank my family, friends, legal team and all those who supported me through this difficult time and I look forward to putting this matter behind me.’   

Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena, pictured standing in a court sketch, was found not guilty by a jury after a trial at Southwark Crown Court in which he claimed to have been used as a 'scapegoat' by hospital bosses

Mr Mohamed's lawyer, Ali Hussain, said: ‘My client has suffered months of stress and the humiliation and lost precious time with his two young children.

‘My client strongly believes this case was nothing more than a show trial – an effort by the CPS to regain some confidence after failing to bring a prosecution despite FGM laws being in place since 1985.’

Last night, the CPS faced questions over why it had decided to bring a case against the highly regarded doctor and Mr Mohamed, who he had not even met before the incident on November 24, 2012.

The alleged victim, who was herself taken to a police station where she was fingerprinted and had DNA samples taken, never supported the case.

And even prosecutor Kate Bex pointed out that the case was a far cry from the stereotype of the ‘back street clinic’.

The alleged victim fled civil war in Somalia in the 1990s, settling in Britain where she got a job at a London hotel and married.

As a result of the FGM she was unable to have sex with her new husband and in 2011, she underwent defibulation – reversal of the procedure. This medical history was not considered when she went into labour at the Whittington, aged 27.

Miss Johnson told Southwark Crown Court in south London: ‘We do suggest that Dr Dharmasena has been hung out to dry and made a scapegoat for the Whittington Hospital and their failings. Yet he is the one paying the price for the hospital’s ineptitude.’

Mr Mohamed, who was acting as the woman’s interpreter, had instructed him to do it, the prosecution said. But he was cleared of inciting FGM. Dr Dharmasena insisted he was not a ‘puppet’ who would give into patient’s demands.

The victim, who had to give evidence about intimate medical procedures, was also against FGM. She told the court she did not want it as she wanted to continue having sex with her husband and they wanted more children.

She went on to have another child, suffering no problems following the procedure by Dr Dharmasena, who is from Sri Lanka.

Last night, Baroness Kennedy, a barrister and anti-FGM campaigner, questioned the CPS. ‘I was concerned about this prosecution because all the evidence pointed to a young doctor who was not adequately prepared for the circumstances which faced him,’ she said.

‘I have not felt adequate training is available to professionals – doctors, nurses, police, teachers and social workers.’

Katrina Erskine, consultant gynaecologist and head of obstetrics at Homerton Hospital, in east London, questioned the decision to charge at the time, describing it as a ‘political prosecution’.

She said last night: ‘Such good news about the verdict – now we can get back to trying to stop FGM happening and support all the doctors and midwives who have been terrified by this case.’

Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, defended the CPS’s decision to take the case to trial saying it did not ‘shy away from difficult cases’.

‘It was right that we put this case before the court and on three separate occasions, once before trial and twice during the trial, the judge dismissed applications by the defence to stop the case, thereby agreeing that the evidence should be considered by a jury,’ she said.

‘The CPS does not choose which cases it is asked to consider for prosecution and we must apply the same test to every case. This will, of course, not affect our resolve to bring those who do commit FGM to justice where we have the evidence to do so.’  

The practice of female genital mutilation dates back at least 2,000 years and was used in ancient Egypt as a sign of distinction amongst the aristocracy.

The FGM National Group, a UK-based charity, said primitive societies believed the procedure would ensure women’s virginity and lead to a reduction in female desire.

In some cultures, it is valued as a rite of passage from childhood to womanhood but others believe it is a means of preserving a girl’s virginity until marriage.

In most of these countries FGM is a pre-requisite for marriage, with marriage being vital to a woman’s social and economic survival.

FGM is rooted in culture and some believe it is carried out for religious reasons. Although not confined to a particular culture or religion, it is most common in Africa.

Female genital mutilation is illegal in the UK under laws introduced in 1985. This legislation was strengthened and updated in 2003 by a private member’s bill introduced by the Labour MP Ann Clwyd.

Under this law, which came into force in March 2004, it is a crime to carry out, aid or abet any form of FGM. The penalties were also increased significantly and allowed the courts to impose prison sentences of between five and 14 years on those who carry out the procedure or on parents who allow their children to be mutilated.

But the failed prosecution in the Dharmasena case that finished yesterday raises questions about future proceedings.

Seven other cases are under investigation and three are with the CPS for consideration. There are also 11 cases in which the CPS decided there should be no further action and one case in which the police decided not to press ahead.
