For a woman who claims she has just become a multimillionaire, Mirlande Wilson certainly did not show it when being interviewed about her alleged Mega Millions win.

The 37-year-old McDonald's employee from Maryland spoke to NBC about buying the winning lotto ticket and remained defiant that it was her own rather than one of the pooled tickets with 15 of her coworkers.

She said: 'I'm so scared, I'm so like this, I'm so shocked. I don't know whats going on.'

When asked where the winning ticket was, the mother-of-seven remained coy and simply said: 'I cannot tell you.'

Defiant: Mirlande Wilson spoke to the Today show about her winning Mega Millions ticket and still claims she bought it outside of the work pool

Baltimore: A crowd of people gathered outside Mirlande's home yesterday where she lives with her seven children as they tried to catch a glimpse of the alleged lotto winner

She claims she gave all of her coworkers the copies of the tickets for the pool and the winning ticket was not among them.

Instead she claims to have sent a friend to buy more tickets later that day and the winning one was among them.

'McDonald's don't have nothing to do 
with this,' she insisted. 'They don't have nothing to do with - they 
don't even know about it and they don't even have nothing to do with 
this. It's only us by ourself [sic].'

Lottery executives said they cannot confirm who the lucky three ticket holders are in Maryland, Kansas and Illinois until they come forward.

Ms Wilson has yet to produce a ticket, leaving Mega Millions officials skeptical.

Stephen Martino, Maryland lottery 
director, told ABC: 'We don't know any more than the public or media 
does and it's all speculation and we're not going to get involved in 
that.'

Another official added: 'It's probably not this person.'

Lucky winner? Mirlande Wilson, who says she bought the winning ticker with her own money rather than the pooled money with coworkers at McDonald's

Proof? Mirlande Wilson showed a reporter the copies of the pooled tickets she shared with her McDonald's employees and said the winning ticket was not among them - though would not say where it was

Winners in Maryland and Illinois have six months to claim the money - Kansas's newest multimillionaire has up to a year.

Both Maryland and Kansas will allow winners to remain anonymous but the lucky ticket-holder in Illinois will be identified.

Ms Wilson had enraged her co-workers
with claims of her scoop after she revealed to the New York Post that 
she was not planning on sharing the millions - despite the fact they had
pooled their money for tickets.

Workers at the fast food outlet bought a number of tickets together for the biggest lottery in world history but Ms Wilson claimed she separately bought one of the three winning tickets.

'We had a group plan, but I went and
played by myself. [The ‘winning’ ticket] wasn’t on the group plan,' 
Wilson told The New York Post.

'I was in the group, but this was 
separate. The winning ticket was a separate ticket,' the single mother-of-seven said as she and her fiancé left her home.

The
Haitian immigrant claimed she had hidden the 
winning ticket and would present it to lottery officials yesterday.

But later she started to backtrack saying she wasn't sure whether she had won or not.

'I don’t know if I won. Some of the numbers were familiar. I recognized some of them,' she said.

'I don’t know why people are saying differently. 'I’m going to go to the lottery office today. I bought some tickets separately.'

With winning tickets also sold in Illinois and Kansas, a single Maryland winner would get an after-tax lump sum of $105 million, or $5.59 million a year for 26 years.

Wilson’s co-workers - who make little more than $7.50 an hour - are furious at her claims she bought the winning ticket with her own money.

'She can’t do this to us!' said 
Suleiman Osman Husein, a shift manager and one of 15 members in the 
pool.

'We each paid $5. She took everybody’s money!'

The
group’s tickets - along with a list of those who contributed to the 
pool - were left in an office safe at the fast food outlet, said the 
man, who gave only his first name, Allen, as he stood next to Layla. She
declined to comment.

Then, late Friday, before the night’s
drawing, the owner of the McDonald’s, Birul Desai, gave Wilson $5 to 
buy more tickets for the pool on her way home from work, and she went 
back to the 7-Eleven and bought them, Allen said. Wilson took those tickets home with her, Allen said.

According to the Post, when she found out she had the winning ticket, she called co-workers and told them she - rather than they - had won.

'I won! I won!' she told a colleague.

McDonald's worker Davon Wilson said he was there when Wilson called.

Three - Winners who matched six numbers

1.5 billion - Dollars spent on Mega Millions tickets

429 million - Dollars spent on tickets on Friday alone

161 - Number of people who matched five numbers and won $250,000

897 - Number of people who matched four numbers and won $10,000

18 - Times the jackpot rolled without a winner, leading to Friday's record of $640 million

12 million - Amount in dollars of this Tuesday's jackpot

100 million - Americans who played Megamillions

182 - Days the Maryland winner has to come forward

365 - Days the Illinois and Kansas winners have to come forward

20,000 - Times more likely to die in a car crash than win the lotto

2,600 - Dollars worth of tickets one man bought in Arizona

'She said, "Turn on the news". She said she had won. I thought it was a joke or something. She doesn’t seem like a person who’d do this,' he said.

Allen told the Post he and Layla then went to Wilson's home to question her about the winning ticket.

Though she first refused to come out, they banged on her door for 20 minutes until she finally relented.

'These people are going to kill you. It’s not worth your life!' Allen said he told her.

'All right! All right! I’ll share, but I can’t find the ticket right now,' she said, according to Allen.

A clerk at the 
7-Eleven where Wilson bought the tickets said they believed it was a man
who had bought the winning ticket and doubted that Wilson's story was 
actually true after lottery officials reviewed the 
store’s CCTV footage.

Carole Everett said they had no information about the Maryland winner and whether it was a man or a woman who bought the winning ticket.

She said: 'Right now, everything is just speculation and gossip.

'Until someone comes through that door and hands over the winning ticket we will not know who the winner is.'

If Wilson won, and if it was with a 
pooled work ticket, the situation would be very similar to that of
New Jersey man Americo Lopes, who was sued by his former colleagues 
after he claimed he was the sole winner of a $38.5 million Mega Millions
lottery jackpot.

The five construction workers say 
they and Lopes were members of a weekly lottery pool, each person 
contributing $2 and Lopes would buy the tickets.

He
claimed he played the lottery both by himself and as a member of the 
pool and that the winning ticket in the November 2009 drawing was one he
bought for himself. Lopes chose the lump-sum payment option and received $24 million.

A jury found that he wrongly refused to share the lottery win with his friends and ordered that he pay them $4million each.

The three jackpot-winning tickets were purchased in Red Bud, Illinois, Baltimore County, Maryland, and Kansas, where state lottery officials have said only that the ticket was sold in the northeast part of the state.

In Illinois, the Chicago Tribune said a second jackpot winner, who also has yet to step forward, bought a quick-pick ticket at a gas station and convenience store in Red Bud, a community of about 3,700 in southwestern Illinois.  

There were also some big consolation prizes. Lottery officials said 161 ticket holders won $250,000 each by matching the first five numbers, and 897 people won $10,000 by matching four numbers plus the stand-alone Mega Ball.

The Maryland and Kansas winners are allowed to remain anonymous because of state laws, but in Illinois, the winner has to be publicized.

Though lottery officials say they encourage winners to come forward and enjoy their 15 minutes of fame.

A donut shop worker in California quit his job after winning $228,000 from Friday's draw.

It took Lazaro Ramos less than an hour to hand in his resignation after he discovered he was among 29 Californians to match five of the six winning numbers in Friday's drawing.

He plans to return to his home country Guatemala to open up his own restaurant.

The winning numbers in Friday night's drawing were 02-04-23-38-46, and the Mega Ball 23.

Previous lottery winners have found that winning an eye-popping jackpot wasn't exactly the dream come true they hoped it would be. In fact for some, it turned into a nightmare.
