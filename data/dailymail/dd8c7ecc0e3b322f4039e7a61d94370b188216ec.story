Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith will use a major speech today to outline his latest reforms of the welfare system

The unemployed will no longer be able simply to ‘sign on’ for benefits and welfare cheats are to face higher fines and losing their homes, ministers will say this week.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith used a major speech today to outline his latest reforms of the welfare system, announcing that from later this month jobseekers will have to prepare a CV and agree to weekly meetings with an adviser before being given benefits.

Mr Duncan Smith also suggested that the ‘open door immigration’ policy run by the last Government had meant foreign workers taking jobs and helping to trap British people in ‘dependency, hopelessness and despair’.

Later this week, employment minister Esther McVey will flesh out the Government’s efforts to restrict benefits for jobless foreigners.

Welfare minister Mike Penning will also set out plans to make welfare cheats sell their homes if necessary to pay higher fines to reimburse taxpayers for the money they have wrongly claimed.

Ministers aim to reduce the proportion of benefits lost to fraud and error from 2.2 per cent in 2010 to 1.7 per cent by next March.

Mr Duncan Smith points to the strength of the UK labour market - with record numbers of people in work, accompanied by dramatic falls in worklessness - as evidence that his reforms are having an impact.

Welfare reform has been a crucial part of Britain’s recovery, helping to create ‘a stable economy matched by a strong society where people are ready and capable of work’,’ he said.

Under Labour, he argues, ‘a combination of the welfare system trapping people in dependency and removing the drive to go to work... and the open door immigration policy meant British people were so easily replaced by foreign workers coming in’.

‘Taxpayers paid a financial cost for rising welfare payments, and society paid the cost as well – with too many of our own fellow citizens falling into dependency, hopelessness, and despair,’ Mr Duncan Smith added.

That situation is now being turned around, with UK nationals making up nearly 90 per cent of the rise in employment in the last year, he insisted.

‘Labour’s Great Recession slashed 7.2% off our economy and cost 750,000 people their jobs,’ he added.

‘Following the crash we heard gloomy forecasts of a million jobs disappearing from the private sector, mass unemployment, lost generations - yet they could not have proved more wrong.

‘Britain’s economic recovery is established and taking hold faster than forecast – and nowhere are the signs of this recovery clearer than in our labour market.’ 

The tightening of the welfare system, as well as the Government’s pro-business measures, have helped give businesses the freedom and confidence to create 1.7 million new jobs since the election.

Mr Duncan Smith, speaking to the Business for Britain campaign group, pointed to record employment – more than half a million higher than its pre-recession peak – and the falling numbers of people absent from the labour market, falling long-term unemployment, and falling number of workless households.

He warned that the job is far from done, however, detailing new measures to take effect this month.Jobseekers will be required to take steps to make themselves attractive to employers before they claim Jobseeker’s Allowance.

Changes include a requirement to prepare a CV, set up an email address and registering for the Government’s new jobs website before making a claim.

There will also have be regular meetings with job centre advisers – weekly rather than fortnightly – for those claimants judged to need more regular monitoring.
