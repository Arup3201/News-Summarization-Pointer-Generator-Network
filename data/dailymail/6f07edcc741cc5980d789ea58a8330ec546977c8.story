Five people were injured and two of them seriously when a ride malfunctioned Thursday night at the North Carolina State Fair in Raleigh.

Riders were getting off the Vortex around 9pm when it unexpectedly started up again injuring five people ranging in age from 14 to 39.

An EMS source told WNCN that all five were initially unconscious but that three regained consciousness. All of the victims were taken to WakeMed. Th same EMS source said that one of the injured is suffering from serious head injuries while the another is suffering injuries similar to a concussion.

Tragedy at the fairgrounds: Five people were injured - and two seriously - when a ride at the North Carolina State Fair unexpectedly started up again just as passengers were exiting

'The ride had stopped and they were fixing to offload when the ride started off again, but that is preliminary,' Wake County Sheriff Donnie Harrison said in a briefing Thursday night. 'It is going to take quite a while to talk to all these people.'

The sheriff's office is interviewing 35 to 40 people to figure out exactly what went wrong on the ride, and is soliciting any video of the accident.

'It could be operator error. We don't know,' Harrison said. 'We aren't going to speculate.'

Under investigation: All five people were taken to WakeMed to be treated for their injuries. The incident is still under investigation by the Wake County Sheriff's Office

Following North Carolina Department of Labor regulations, the ride is tested three times a day to insure safety. This is the first time the Vortex ride is at the State Fair.

The injuries today happen 11 years to the day that a man was killed from a similar ride at the North Carolina state fair.

Richard Gephart was near the ride when it malfunctioned and witnessed the accident.

'It sounded like a bunch of stuff hitting metal, and that was it,' he told WNCN. After that, Mr Gephart said it was silence, he didn't even hear screams but then emergency crews started responding.Â 

Another witness saw two people lying face down and the ride operator fall to his knees and start crying.

The incident is still under investigation. Brian Lind with the State Fair expressed his sympathy for the injured and their families.

'This has shaken all of us, 'Mr Long said. 'We definitely have these folks in our thoughts and prayers.'

Despite the accident, the State Fair will still be open tomorrow, officials said.
