Andrew Robertson’s rise to prominence has been as rapid as it has been remarkable.

On Tuesday, the 20-year-old is expected to start for Scotland against England at Celtic Park. The last time the Auld Enemies met, at Wembley in August 2013, the young left back had only 180 competitive minutes of professional football under his belt with Dundee United.

Released by Celtic at the age of 15 for the depressingly familiar crime of being too small, he was forced to rebuild his career in the Scottish fourth tier as a part-timer with Hampden Park-based Queen’s Park.

Celtic released Andrew Robertson when he was 15, but he looks like becoming a regular for Scotland

Fast forward five years and Robertson looks set to be the first-choice Scotland left back for years to come and one of the first names on the Hull City team-sheet.

The Scot’s fairytale journey even caught the eye of Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany.

The pair’s paths first crossed two years ago when Robertson worked evenings dishing out programmes for international games at Hampden and Kompany was on a spying trip for Belgium before they faced the Scots in qualification for the World Cup.

After Robertson was called up for the first time by Gordon Strachan, Kompany tweeted a good luck message to the young Scot: ‘Andy Robertson, stories like yours are inspiring! Wish you all the best!’

Robertson recalls: ‘I went to plenty of Scotland games as a kid and then from 16 I worked at Hampden. Part of my job was to give out programmes in the private lounges before the games. It wasn’t the worst job in the world as you got into all the matches for free.

‘I met Kompany and got my picture taken with him, although I didn’t really speak to him. He was massive and I looked pretty small beside him.

‘When I got released from Celtic I was 15, I hadn’t really grown, I wasn’t strong enough. I knew I had a lot to improve. I needed to move on to the next level when I left Queen’s Park and luckily Dundee United provided me with that chance.

‘I knew it was a big leap to go from handing out programmes but I was confident in my ability.’

Robertson’s form at Tannadice saw him outshine the likes of Ryan Gauld, who won a £3million move to Sporting Lisbon, in a season of entertaining football that ended in a 2-0 Scottish Cup final defeat by St Johnstone in May.

Former Dundee United man Robertson was hugely impressive in Scotland's recent clash against Ireland 

Dundee United are producing some major talent. Sunderland last season had a £600,000 bid accepted for defender John Souttar, but the 18-year-old decided to stay at Tannadice. Midfielders Stuart Armstrong, 22, and Ryan Dow, 23, are also tipped for big things. Their reputation is largely down to a coach, Ian Cathro, who ran his own soccer school.

Former Dundee United manager Craig Levein made the then-unknown coach the head of United’s youth academy at the age of 22. Cathro was fast-tracked into the SFA, put in charge of the regional performance school in Dundee and has gone on to become assistant coach at Valencia.

Stevie Campbell is the current United youth director and Under 20 coach and, with assistant Dave Bowman, United's youth set-up is now the envy of Scotland.

For Robertson, Scotland Under 21 recognition soon followed his thrilling appearances for United and his break came when Strachan asked a number of young players to help his senior squad prepare to face the USA last October.

Robertson impressed Strachan in training and with his attitude, and he has started both of Scotland’s home Euro 2016 qualifiers against Georgia and Ireland.

At club level, Robertson has made swapping the Scottish top flight for the Barclays Premier League look easy after a £2.85m move to Hull.

‘He’s totally and utterly shocked me with his ability to step in,’ said Hull boss Steve Bruce. ‘He’s 20 years old and playing at the highest level and he’s going to have a big future. He’s a fantastic talent, a humble lad and as quick as I’ve seen any full back.’

Robertson added to his reputation on Friday night when he gave Ireland duo Aiden McGeady and Seamus Coleman a torrid evening down the left in a vital 1-0 win.

Born in 1994, he harbours only hazy memories of the last time Scotland reached a major finals.

‘My auntie had a big party for the opening game of the 1998 World Cup against Brazil,’ he says. ‘I remember more about the actual party than the game.’

JAMIE REDKNAPP: I played Scotland three times in my career and the games were always fast, furious and aggressive, but I’ll never forget walking out at Hampden Park. We felt like gladiators heading into the arena — we were waiting for the lions to be unleashed because it felt like we were about to be eaten alive. That was the first half of a play-off to reach Euro 2000, so it was a massive game. 

JOHN WARK: You can’t call Scotland v England games friendlies. I had team-mates at Ipswich who I would play with and then against. You wanted to kick lumps out of each other, and that is what happened in those days. Mick Mills was our captain at Ipswich, but (with England) he was against us. You want to beat England and vice versa, that won’t change. But after the game we went on holiday together... and are still talking about it to this day.
