Panamanian officials have identified the skeletal remains of a California woman who disappeared in 2011 in Panama after arriving in the country with her boyfriend.

DNA testing confirmed that the remains found last week on the island province of Bocas del Toro came from Yvonne Lee Baldelli, who was last seen there in November 2011.

A man who was cutting bushes found a bag containing Baldelli's remains on August 20 and contacted police.

Identified: Human remains found in a bag on an island off of Panama have been identified as those of Yvonne Baldelli, a California woman who went missing in November 2011

The 42-year-old woman from Laguna Nigel, California, arrived in Panama with boyfriend Brian Brimager in September 2011. Her family reported her missing the following January.

Baldelli's family has said Baldelli, a clothing designer, was frequently out of touch so they did not immediately suspect anything was wrong.

Panama police say Brimager left Panama for Costa Rica and the United States about 10 days after last being seen with Baldelli.

A local on Isla Carenero discovered a 'green military style' backpack containing a human skull, some bones and women's clothing, according to law enforcement.

A photo released by Baldelli's sister was taken in Bocas del Toro, Panama. Panamanian and US authorities have worked together to first find the 42-year-old's body and then try to find her killer

Charged: Brimager was arrested by the FBI at his California home and charged in connection with the 2011 murder of his girlfriend Yvonne Baldelli, though he was not charged specifically with her murder

Her sister, Michelle Faust, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Brimager, an ex-Marine, is being held in California on obstruction of justice charges.

'The whole family has been very sad and desperate...we didn't know where Yvonne was,' Faust said. 'The good thing about today is that once the evidence (from the remains) is studied we will be able to bring her home.'

Panamanian investigators and FBI agents are working together on the case.

Last year, FBI agents and Panamanian forensic specialists found traces of blood on the walls and floor of the hostel El Sapo in the Bocas del Toro archipelago, which is the popular tourist spot where Baldelli was last seen.

Baldelli was last seen at a steakhouse in the town of Bocas del Toro with Brimager on November 26, 2011, according to the U.S. Attorney's office, which also said he physically abused her before she went missing.

He has not been charged with murder but faces ten counts of obstruction of justice and one count of false statement to a federal officer.

Brimager is accused of dumping a bloody mattress in the ocean to cover up his girlfriend's death after searching online for how to get the stains out.

He is said to have packed her belongings into garbage bags and left them outside the hostel for disposal.

The indictment claims that on November 29 Brimager began sending fake emails to a hotel manager, friends and family from Ms Baldelli's account.

It also states that on his way back to California he made a two-day layover in Costa Rica and used her ATM card to make it look like she was withdrawing money.

This was to back up the retired Marine's story that had Ms Baldelli had 'broken up with Brimager and was headed to Costa Rica with a man named Tony Gonzales.'

'Brimager impersonated Baldelli over email in an attempt to trick her friends and family into believing she was still alive, thereby obstructing, influencing and impeding investigation into her disappearance and suspected death,' the indictment says.

The indictment adds that when Brimager landed in San Diego on December 12, 2011, another woman, known as K.W., met him at the airport.

'He proposed to her two days later and they married shortly thereafter,' the document states.

Brimager faces a maximum sentence of 205 years in prison and a $2.5million fine if found guilty of every charge.
