A Southwest Airlines flight that was supposed to land at Branson Airport has instead landed at a smaller airport just outside of the southwest Missouri town.

Southwest Airlines said late Sunday in a statement that Flight 4013 was scheduled to go from Chicago's Midway International Airport to Branson Airport.

The flight instead landed nine miles north at Taney County Airport.

Wrong runway:  Flight 4013 from Chicago landed at Taney County Airport instead of Branson Airport. The Boeing 737-700 carried 124 passengers and a crew of five

Delay: After a five hour delay, passengers were bussed to the correct airport and re-boarded the plane to continue their journey

The pilot hit the brakes hard, according to passenger Scott Schieffer.

The Dallas attorney and CPA tweeted that the pilot informed passengers that they were at a smaller airport.

Passengers were kept on board for about 75 minutes before the doors opened.

'We have all deplaned from @SouthwestAir 4013, and the mood is somber now that we realized we were 40 feet from the edge of a cliff,' Schieffer tweeted.

Southwest spokesman Brad Hawkins said there were 124 passengers and five crew members on the flight. He also said the landing was 'uneventful.'

'Our ground crew from the Branson airport has arrived at the airport to take care of our customers and their baggage,' Hawkins said. 'The landing was uneventful, and all customers and crew are safe.'

He said he had no explanation for why the jet landed at the county-owned airport, which primarily serves charter, corporate and general aviation flights. It was originally developed by the College of the Ozarks.

Tony Molinaro, Federal Aviation Agency spokesman for its central region, says the FAA is investigating the incident.

Where they landed: The jet landed at Taney Airport. The runway is half the length of the one at Branson airport

The flight was scheduled to go from Chicago to Branson, and then on to Dallas.

After last nights landing, passengers were then bussed to the correct airport to continue their journey.Â 

The M. Graham Clark Airport started as a dirt runway in the late 1960s. The longest of the two asphalt runways there is 3,738 feet.. At the commercial Branson airport, the concrete runway is more than 7,000 feet in length.

In December, Southwest Airlines announced it will cease operations at the Branson Airport in June after serving the airport for about 15 months.
