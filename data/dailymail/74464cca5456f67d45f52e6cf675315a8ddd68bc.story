Triple J presenter and stand up comedian Matt Okine has revealed his girlfriend of nine years cheated on him with his best friend.

The 29-year-old breakfast radio host told Pedestrian TV the long-term couple broke up right before he took up his new role at Triple J earlier this year.

Okine said it was a tough transition because he grew up with his girlfriend and she was right there with him when he was doing open mic sessions in Brisbane every third week as he launched his career.

'I found out she was having an affair with my best friend,' Okine said. 

'At one stage we were all living together in the house, (it's) full on sort of TV s***.

'Fidelity is such a flimsy reality. So many people hide behind this idea of monogamy and it's all bulls***. I don't know a single couple that I'm friends with who haven't strayed. 

'Sometimes you just sit around and you feel so silly – am I the only f***ing idiot who is faithful?'

The 29-year-old turned up to the ARIA awards red carpet as child dancer Maddy Ziegler from Sia's film clip Chandelier, while co-host Alex Dyson dressed as Chet Faker

Okine, pictured here with Lorde and co-host Alex Dyson, said he and his girlfriend broke up right before he took up his new role at Triple J earlier this year

But he said there were two sides to every story and admitted he became distant as his career gained momentum.

'I had become increasingly distant in our relationship because I was travelling six months a year… I wasn't as present as I had been as an open micer,' Okine said.

It comes just days after Okine revealed to Pedestrian about  performing autofellatio on himself once when he was 15.

The story came out after the radio star decided he didn't want to be embarrassed by things he had done or experienced in the past.

'It happened when I was 15... I tried to do it and I succeeded. It was for just 10 seconds,' he said. 

Okine, who shot to fame this year from his Triple J co-hosting job with Alex Dyson, caused a stir on the red carpet at this year's ARIA awards after he showed up in a leotard dressed as child dancer Maddy Ziegler from Sia's film clip Chandelier.

Okine said it was a tough transition because he grew up with his girlfriend and she was right there with him when he was doing open mic sessions in Brisbane every third week
