Accidental death: Stuart James Bullas, 57, was crushed to death by his beloved classic car at his factory in Lye, near Birmingham

A company director and motor-racing enthusiast was crushed to death when his prized vintage sports car fell on him as he repaired it.

Stuart James Bullas, 57, of Edgbaston, Birmingham, had broken several motor racing  records in amateur competitions with his beloved yellow Austin Healey Sprite Mark 1, which weighed more than half a tonne.

Mr Bullas, who was divorced and had no children, was found dead on the shop floor of his family engineering firm BG Bullas Ltd in Lye, near Stourbridge, on April 10.

He had been doing some last-minute work on the car, which had appeared on Top Gear and was driven by The Stig, before a race.

Black Country coroner Robin Balmain 
heard the business owner had apparently used a crane to lift the vehicle
but had not secured it properly on the frame.

It fell out of a 
cradle, crushing him as he lay on the floor beneath it, while clutching a
ratchet drive.

His body was found by his driving partner Robin Johnson and some other friends. He was declared dead at the scene by 
paramedics.

Mr Johnson, of Kings Norton, who had known Mr Bullas 
since he was 15, recalled how he tried in vain to life the car off his friend.

Fighting back tears, he said: 'Stuart
must have used the crane to lift the car and it probably slipped off 
the loop and fell on him.'

Mr Bullas had usually been 'a 
stickler for making sure things were properly done', Mr Johnson said, as
he had lost two fingers in a metal press when younger.

They had co-owned the car and arranged to meet at the factory on the 
day Mr Bullas's body was found, so they could go to Loton Park, near 
Shrewsbury, for a race.

Another friend Dave Powell described Mr Bullas as being 'careful and fearless'.

Mr Bullas's older brother Graham, from Christchurch in Dorset, said: 'He was a lovely person - very generous and considerate and it was summed up at the funeral. There were hundreds of people there.'

He added: 'Anybody working on a motor vehicle in the future who reads this sad story must take care to avoid such tragic accidents themselves.'

Mr Balmain ruled Mr Bullas died of traumatic asphyxia due to being trapped under a motor vehicle and that it had been an accident.
