It is a notorious website which allows complete strangers from all over the world to chat to each other face-to-face.

And with 1.3million visitors per day, it is fair to say Chatroulette gets a complete cross-section of people from all walks of life logging on.

Remarkably, however, the popular site has led to love for one lucky couple.

Lovestruck: Alex and Siobhan Rodgers are believed to be the first couple ever to marry after meeting by chance on Chatroulette

Lovestruck Alex and Siobhan Rodgers are 
believed to be the first couple ever to marry after meeting by chance on the site.

Mrs Rodgers, 23, who is American, and her 28-year-old British husband clicked immediately while using the site for the very first time.

Love blossomed and the pair have now tied the knot and settled down to enjoy married life in London.

Chatroulette allows users to chat to total strangers via a webcam but has attracted criticism for attracting voyeurs.

In order to find a new person to talk to, users simply press the 'next' button, known as 'nexting'.

Mrs Rodgers said: 'I turned it on and literally the first person I saw was Alex.

Together: Love quickly blossomed between the pair and they have now tied the knot and settled down to enjoy married life in London

'I thought he was really hot and we got talking - we spoke for six hours!

'We started to panic that we might press the next, button and we would be lost forever, so we added each other on Facebook.'

Mrs Rodgers clicked onto Chatroulette for the first time in November 2009 after watching an episode of South Park where the website was heavily parodied.

Mr Rodgers was also using the site for the first time. He said: 'I had been on it for a few hours and came across Siobhan.

'I was blown away with her beauty, and we immediately clicked.

Happy: Alex and Siobhan Rodgers married in Michigan in August last year

'I just really fell for her. There was spark and it was a bit flirtatious and we seemed very keen and interested in each other.'

The pair stayed up that first night chatting until well into the next day and their romance blossomed.

They
regularly spoke on Facebook and Skype, and in April 2010 the Londoner 
flew to Michigan to meet his future wife and her family.

There were concerns that Mrs Rodgers  friends might think it strange an Englishman came to America to visit her, but he proved very popular.

Mr Rodgers said: 'Siobhan's mum trusted her instincts and her friends liked me when they met me.'

She said: 'He was as good in person as he was through a computer screen - he met my family and they all loved him.'

Their cyber-romance flourished and in September that year Mrs Rodgers quit her job and moved to London to be with her website designer partner.

He proposed in February and they married in Michigan in August last year.

She said: 'We now live in London and are truly in love and we owe it all to Chatroulette.

'We were one of the lucky ones, as I know most people on there are doing things that are not exactly a conversation starter!'

Chatroulette has made headlines for the uncontrolled nature of random webcam conversations - the website is notorious for the number of men performing sex-acts on themselves.

Mrs Rodgers said their love for Chatroulette is as strong as ever, and they often surf the web together from their home in Kings Cross.

She said: 'We have gone on as a couple a couple of times since we were married and had a chat to a few people.'

Chatroulette is in the top 500 most popular websites, and even celebrities have claimed to use the site, including Jessica Alba, Paris Hilton, Justin Bieber and Olly Murs.
