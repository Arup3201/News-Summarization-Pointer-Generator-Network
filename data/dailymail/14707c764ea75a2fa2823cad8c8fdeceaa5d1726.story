Suicide? Gregory McFadden, 61, bought a helicopter tour for two but showed up alone

The California man has jumped out of a helicopter and plummeted 500 feet to his death had a chronic health problem that prevented him from sleeping and he couldn't get the surgery to fix it, his brother has revealed.

Gregory McFadden, 61, landed in the water a few feet off upscale Newport Beach in Orange County, California, in broad daylight Tuesday afternoon.

He was pulled from the surf by lifeguards, who performed CPR on him on the crowded beach. However, he was unconscious and died after being taken to the hospital.

His brother Bradley McFadden told the San Gabriel Valley Tribune that his brother suffered for years from a medical condition for which he couldn't get treatment.

'He said he was choking so bad, he couldn’t sleep... It was very painful. He was losing sleep. And he couldn’t get an operation,' Mr McFadden said.

The condition was a problem with a valve that resulted in a form of acid reflux that caused food to continually come back up as it was digesting.

McFadden, who was on Social Security and disability, had been trying for years to get an operation to fix the valve, but the procure was continually delayed or canceled.

Mr McFadden believes his brother likely lost hope and decided to take his own life.

The pilot of the helicopter said McFadden, the only passenger aboard the aircraft, suddenly opened the door and jumped out.

The
 chopper was operated by Cardinal Air Services, which offers aerial 
tours of Orange County. It is owned by Chuck Street, a longtime pilot 
and on-air traffic reporter.

Mr Street said his son Corbin was flying the helicopter at the time and struggled with McFadden before he plunged to his death.

'It’s the last thing I ever thought would happen to my son,' Mr Street told the Los Angeles Times.

Mr Street revealed the McFadden, from West Covina, paid $310 to reserve an afternoon helicopter beach tour for two.

But, when he showed up at the airport Tuesday, he was by himself.

McFadden splashed down near Balboa Pier and a busboy at a restaurant at the end of the pier watched him fall from the white Robinson R44 craft, according to Ruby's Diner general manager David Saighani.

Suicide? Authorities are investigating what seems likely to be a suicide. The man was pulled from the chilly Pacific and given CPR. He died from his critical injuries after he was taken to the hospital

Police in Huntington Beach were apparently the first to be alerted of the fall, which was reported by the private helicopter company according to a police release.

'The only passenger on board opened the door and jumped out into the water,' FAA spokesman Ian Gregor told KTLA.

Huntington Beach authorities worked together with Newport Beach lifeguards and Orange County sheriffs to find the man and pull him ashore.

'Lifeguards brought the man to shore and initiated lifesaving efforts,' police spokesperson Jennifer Manzella said.

McFadden was taken to the hospital in critical condition.

'There’s probably more to it than what it seems to be,' said Sergeant Mike Robertson, of the Orange County Sheriff's Department.
