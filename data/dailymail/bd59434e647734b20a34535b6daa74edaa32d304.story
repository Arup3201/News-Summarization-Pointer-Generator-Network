Argentina legend Gabriel Batistuta begged a doctor to amputate his legs due to the excruciating pain he felt after retiring in 2005.

The former striker, who netted 56 times in 78 international caps and terrorised defences in Serie A for years, suffered terribly from the stress he had put on his body during a 17-year career.

Batistuta, who netted a penalty against England at the 1998 World Cup, was unable to walk and would wet the bed as he could not face dragging himself to the bathroom.

Career

Newell's Old Boys (1988–1989) - 24 games, 7 goalsRiver Plate (1989-90) - 21, 4Boca Juniors (1990-91) - 30, 13Fiorentina (1991-2000) - 269, 168Roma (2000-03) - 63, 30Inter Milan (2003, loan) - 12, 2Al Arabi (2003-05) - 21, 25

Argentina (1991-2002) - 78 caps, 56 goals

And the former Fiorentina and Roma striker felt in so much pain at the age of 36 that he longed to have his legs removed, just like South African athlete Oscar Pistorius. 

The now 45-year-old told TyC Sports: 'I left football and overnight I couldn’t walk.

'I wet the bed even though the bathroom was only three metres away. It was 4am and I knew if I stood my ankle would kill me.

'I went to see Doctor Avanzi (an Orthopaedics specialist) and told him to cut off my legs. He looked at me and told me I was crazy.

'I couldn’t 
bear it any longer. I can’t put in to words just how bad the pain was. I
 looked at Oscar Pistorius and said, "That’s my solution".'

Despite
 begging doctors to amputate his legs, medical professionals chose to 
fit screws into one of his legs instead due to the lack of cartilage and
 tendons.

Goals: Batistuta netted 300 clubs goals during his career, including 207 for Serie A club Fiorentina

This largely rectified the problem as it prevented bone rubbing on bone, and Batistuta is no longer suffering from the excruciating pain he felt upon retirement. 

Batistuta made 516 career appearances, scoring 300 goals, including 207 for Fiorentina during a nine-year spell in Florence.

The prolific forward also won the Argentina Primera Division in 1990, as well as Serie A with Roma in 2001.
