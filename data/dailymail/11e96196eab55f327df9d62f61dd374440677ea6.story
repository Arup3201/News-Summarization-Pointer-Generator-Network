Some people keep guinea pigs or hamsters as pets. But in Cuba, where a larger, more exotic rodent runs wild, Ana Pedraza and her husband prefer the hutia.

With a rope-like tail and long front teeth, the hutia grows more than half a metre in length, weighs the same as a dog and has the appearance of a giant rat.

Now Mrs Pedraza and her husband Rafael Lopez have made it their mission to save the maligned creatures - by domesticating them with kisses, car rides and nips of rum.

The couple say they only want to want to protect and take care of the animals, which are often killed for food on the Caribbean islands to which they are endemic.

They began collecting hutias about five years ago when they found one languishing on a roadside and named her Congui.

Not long after, they found her a mate and now have more than a half-dozen hutias in their home, about  25 miles east of the capital, Havana.

The couple claim Congui and her family like to drink sweetened coffee and munch on crackers and vegetables.

Congui's son Pancho also enjoys an occasional nip of rum - which is delivered to him on the tongue of Mr Lopez.

While some hutias can be aggressive, the couple claim they have found the huge rodents to be wonderful companions.

The hutia is a large rodent endemic to the Caribbean islands which can grow more than half a metre in length.

Although they look like giant rats, they are more closely related to the much cuter guinea pigs and hamsters.

Though they are generally herbivores, some variations of the hutia (many of which are now extinct) eat small insects and reptiles.

Remarkably, there is an overabundance of the rodents at the Guantanamo military base in Cuba due to a lack of predators.

However, across the rest of the country, a single hutia is revered for its ability to feed an entire family - usually once it is stewed with nuts and honey, and served with sauce.
