A woman forgave her rapist during his sentencing Tuesday.

Survivor Jane Piper forgave Gilbert Lozano Trejo for the 2003 attack inside a Los Angeles U.S. District Courthouse, CBS Los Angeles reported. 

'Before I go into detail about what your beating and raping me did to my life and did to me, I do want to thank you for taking responsibility for what you did,' Piper said in a video from the affiliate station. 'It means a lot to me that you have pleaded guilty.'

Piper has been named by multiple media outlets and has said she wanted to come forward.

Speaking out: Survivor Jane Piper forgave her rapist 

She continued in the video 'I acknowledge, Gilbert Trejo, that you did these horrible things to me. You intentionally made a conscious choice to do them. But I forgive you.'

Earlier in the day, Piper said in a statement 'On Aug. 21, 2003, I was brutally beaten and raped in Brentwood,' CBS Los Angeles reported. 'The rapist attempted to drive away holding me captive in my vehicle. But believing in my heart that he would kill me, I was able to jump out the window of the car as he sped off.'

Trejo will be behind bars for 20 years, and entered guilty pleas for both carjacking and rape charges three years ago, the affiliate station reported.

'I want this so badly,' Piper also said in the filmed encounter. 'This is such a horrible thing you did to my life and I want it to turn into something better, something strong, something good. So please do something good with your next 20 years, okay?' 

She said at one point, 'You forcibly raped me while continually punching me in the face over and over again. I'm acknowledging you did all these horrible things to me. But I forgive you for it. I've got to forgive you, okay?'

During Piper's questioning, Trejo said 'I know that it happened but I do not remember why or when,' CBS Los Angeles reported.

Outside the courtroom, she told the affiliate station 'Women are raped every single day, and yet we so very rarely hear from them. I do not want to be silent.' 

Peace: Piper, seen here  outside the courtroom, has said 'Women are raped every single day, and yet we so very rarely hear from them. I do not want to be silent'
