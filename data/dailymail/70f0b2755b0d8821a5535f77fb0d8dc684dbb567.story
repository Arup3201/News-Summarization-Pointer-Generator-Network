Juventus eased to a 3-1 win at relegation-threatened Cagliari on Thursday to ensure they ended the year at the top of the Serie A standings.

Early goals from Carlos Tevez and Arturo Vidal gave Juventus a comfortable lead in the opening 15 minutes, and Fernando Llorente sealed the victory shortly after halftime.

Luca Rossettini bagged a consolation goal for Cagliari.

Juventus moved four points ahead of second-place Roma, who host AC Milan on Saturday.

Cagliari, the only Serie A side without a home win this season, remained in the bottom three.

The match, which was part of the final round of fixtures before the winter break, was brought forward because Juventus plays Napoli in the rearranged Italian Supercup on Monday. 

After seeing their advantage cut to one point last weekend with a second successive draw, Juventus' determination to end the year on a high received the perfect start when Cagliari goalkeeper Alessio Cragno could only parry Giorgio Chiellini's effort and Tevez was on hand to tap the ball in, less than four minutes in.

More poor defending saw Juventus double their advantage as Cagliari failed to deal with a cross and the ball came out to Vidal, who curled a magnificent strike into the far corner from just outside the box.

Llorente extended Juve's lead six minutes after the break when he gathered Andrea Pirlo's lofted pass with his back to goal, swiveled, and fired under Cragno's body.

Cagliari hadn't scored for three matches but managed to in the 65th minute, as Rossettini headed home Andrea Cossu's free kick.
