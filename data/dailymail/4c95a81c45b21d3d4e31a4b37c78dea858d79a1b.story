The co-pilot was at the controls of the doomed AirAsia flight just before it plunged into the ocean, Indonesia's lead investigator revealed today.

The Airbus A320 vanished from radar screens in bad weather on December 28, less than halfway into a two-hour flight from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore, killing all 162 people on board.

Second-in-command Remi Plesel was flying Flight QZ8501 prior to it crashing into the sea, not Captain Iriyanto - an experienced former military jet pilot - head National Transport Safety Committee (NTSC) investigator Mardjono Siswosuwarno announced today.

Cpt Iriyanto, 53, is believed to have taken over control of the aircraft from First Officer Plesel when it started to ascend and then descend sharply, officials said.

Data from the black box flight data recorder has provided
the accident probe with a 'pretty clear picture' of what
happened in the last moments of the AirAsia flight, but
officials offered few details.

'The second-in-command, popularly known as the co-pilot, who
usually sits to the right of the cockpit. At the time, he was
flying the plane,' the investigator said, referring to First Officer Plesel.

'The captain, sitting to the left, was the pilot
monitoring.'

Throughout his career as an engineer for the energy company Total, the first officer had wanted to fly, so a few years ago he quit his job and learned how to.

He got a job with AirAsia, and at the time of the accident had earned 2,275 flying hours. 

His sister Renee, who last spoke to him on December 26, previously told France's RTL radio: 'Aviation was his passion and he was able to make it real.

'He told me that things were going well, that he'd had a good Christmas. He was happy. The rains were starting, the weather was bad, it was raining a lot. He was going to work the next day.'

The cause of AirAsia's first fatal crash, which occurred
about 40 minutes into the flight, is still unknown.

Investigators said the cockpit voice and flight data
recorders showed that the plane had been cruising at a stable
altitude before the crash.

The aircraft was in sound
condition when it took off and all crew members were properly
certified, they said.

'The plane was flying before the incident within the limits
of its weight and balance envelope,' investigator Siswosuwarno said. 'While the
flight crew had valid licences and medical certificates.'

Indonesian officials previously said the aircraft climbed abruptly
from its cruising height and then stalled, or lost lift, before
plunging out of control into the sea.

NTSC chief Tatang Kurniadi told the same Jakarta news
conference that Indonesia had submitted its preliminary report
on the crash to the International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO) on Wednesday, as required under global aviation rules.

The report, which has not been made public, was purely
factual and contained no analysis, he said, adding that the
full, final report would take at least  six to seven months to complete.

A total of 70 bodies have now been recovered after the plane crashed with 162 people on board

It was also announced that the search for dozens of victims
still unaccounted for could end within days if no more bodies
were found.

A multinational search and recovery operation has led to the discovery of 70
bodies in the Java Sea.

It was hoped  more would be found following the discovery of the plane's fuselage, but days of rough weather and poor
underwater visibility hampered navy divers' efforts.

Cpt Iriyanto was an experienced Air Force pilot who flew F-16 fighter jets before taking early retirement to become a commercial airline pilot. 

He had more than 20,000 flying hours, of which 6,100 were with AirAisa on the Airbus 320.
