New drone footage filmed by a campaign group is hoping to raise awareness of Lolita, the killer whale that has lived in captivity for 44 years.

The 7,000-pound whale was first captured off the coast of Washington in 1970 and has been living in a 35-foot-wide tank ever since.

The video was recorded by activist Paul James for Drones for Animal Defense, who wanted to highlight the whale's conditions at Miami Seaquarium.

The tank, which reportedly violates the US's Animal Welfare Act for a whale the size of Lolita, is said to be 13 feet smaller than the legal requirement, according to protest groups, with no protection from the sun and elements.

Campaign groups Whale and Dolphin Conservation and Orca Network have both highlighted the issue of Lolita's captivity.

The Orca Network keeps fellow campaigners informed on its website, explaining: 'In the summer of 2011 a legal team began planning actions to help Lolita return to her native waters. 

'Mostly from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and the Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF), the team arrived at a multi-pronged approach.

'First, they focused on the fact the Seaquarium whale tank violates multiple provisions of the Animal Welfare Act, administered by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) under the USDA (US Department of Agriculture).'

While the original court case did not succeed, campaigners are still working to have Lolita placed in a larger sea pen in the San Juan Islands. 

The Orca Network claims Lolita's tank is the smallest and oldest in America and reports that Miami Seaquarium does not have the immediate funds for a new alternative.

MailOnline Travel has contacted Miami Seaquarium for comment on the allegations.

In August, the Miami Seaquarium was fined $7,000 for allowing trainers to work with the orca without sufficient protection.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires that either trainers keep a safe distance from killer whales or that a physical barrier is in place.

The regulations were approved following the death of trainer Dawn Brancheau who was killed by orca Tilikum at the SeaWorld park in Orlando, Florida.
