Lost: Cait Reilly, 22, outside the High Court today, lost her case today claiming that working at Poundland for free amounted to 'slave labour'

A graduate who claimed that being made to stack shelves in Poundland on a back-to-work scheme was ‘slave labour’ yesterday lost her human rights case.

The High Court ruled that the scheme was lawful and rejected Cait Reilly’s claim that the Government had infringed her rights by forcing her to work for free at the discount store.

Miss Reilly, 23, had alleged that a scheme designed to encourage the long-term unemployed back to work had breached Article Four of the European Convention on Human Rights, which bans forced labour and slavery.

But Mr Justice Foskett said: ‘Characterising such a scheme as involving or being analogous to “slavery” or “forced labour” seems to me to be a long way from contemporary thinking.’

He added that the scheme was ‘a very long way removed from the kind of colonial exploitation of labour that led to the formulation of Article Four’.

Miss Reilly graduated from Birmingham University with a degree in geology in June 2010 and began to claim jobseeker’s allowance that August while volunteering at a local museum, The Pen Room, in the hope of getting a job.

But when she made a second claim for the unemployment benefit in July last year she was told she must undergo six weeks of training, effectively forcing her to abandon her voluntary work placement and her hopes of it leading to a career.

When she told her Jobcentre Plus adviser she did not want to participate she was told it was ‘mandatory’ and that she risked losing her £53.45-a-week jobseeker’s allowance if she refused.

Miss Reilly said she could not afford to lose her only source of income. She was sent for a week’s training and then to the Poundland store in King’s Heath, Birmingham.

She was required to sweep floors and stack shelves for five hours a day, five days a week for no pay as part of her ‘training’, it was claimed. Miss Reilly said: ‘I was actually doing something that was helping me work towards a job and was taken away from that to do something of no value to me.’

She believes the placement allowed Poundland to use her and five other claimants as ‘free labour’ in the run-up to Christmas.

At the High Court in London, the judge
dismissed her claim for breach of human rights but said the Department 
for Work and Pensions had broken jobseekers’ regulations.

She should not have been told it was 
mandatory to participate in the Work Academy Scheme, but once she agreed
to take part her benefits were at risk, he said.

Miss Reilly, who has since returned to her voluntary role at the museum, refused to comment on the judge’s ruling.

But Work and Pensions Secretary Iain 
Duncan Smith said: ‘Comparing our initiatives to slave labour is not 
only ridiculous but insulting to people facing real oppression.’

The programme was designed to help 
250,000 young people gain skills through training and unpaid work 
experience in the public, private and charity sectors. But it attracted 
criticism when it emerged that the jobless were effectively working for 
free – or for expenses.
