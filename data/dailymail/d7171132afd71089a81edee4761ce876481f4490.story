John Carver says Newcastle United need a clear-out this summer.

The head coach is in danger of missing out on a permanent appointment following a string of desperate displays by his team, who were accused by Match of the Day pundit Phil Neville of having their flip-flops on.

Carver hit back at that on Friday but fired his own warning to those who have performed so poorly. And with Sammy Ameobi, Ryan Taylor and Jonas Gutierrez out of contract in the summer, plenty of players will come under threat.

‘They know there has to be a clear-out,’ he said. ‘It’s pretty obvious, to the man in the street and to the professionals — it has to be done.

‘There are people out of contract, people who are not good enough — they know that.’

Carver’s words are his strongest since taking over from Alan Pardew in January. The Magpies held a dressing-room inquest in the wake of last Sunday’s 3-0 surrender at Everton and the boss admits everyone — himself included — is fighting for his future at the club.

‘We all are,’ he said. ‘That’s why I was a bit astonished when people (Neville) came out and talked about us being on the beach and wearing flip-flops. How can players do that when they know that everybody is playing for their futures?’

Carver’s situation has not been helped by the lack of player investment in the January window which has left him with just 13 senior players ahead of today’s visit of Arsenal.

Right-back Daryl Janmaat will deputise for suspended skipper Fabricio Coloccini at centre-back, despite admitting earlier in the week that he’d never played there.

Carver said: ‘I think he’s a great professional and he will deal with it. He understands the game, he is a full international. It’s another string to his bow and I think he’ll cope with it.

‘He’s been great around the place. He’s such a character. He’s larger than life and he’s quite funny, but he’s a good professional with it.

‘When we lost Mathieu Debuchy (to Arsenal) it was a blow but we replaced him with a better all-round player.

‘But I must admit I’ve never been in a position like this (with injuries and suspension) and I don’t think anybody I’ve ever worked with has, either.

‘I’m missing my best players and that’s how I look at it. With Papiss Cisse it’ s like Tottenham being without Harry Kane. With Siem de Jong, it’s like them being without Christian Eriksen.

‘It’s tough, but we’re not going to use that as an excuse and throw in the towel. Definitely not.’
