A man has been left stunned after an ambulance arrived at his house to take his wife to a hospital appointment – three months after she died.

Chris Davidson, from Swindon, Wiltshire, was preparing for the first Christmas without his wife, Valerie - who passed away in September – when the ambulance turned up on Christmas Eve.

The 61-year-old said paramedics told him they had come to collect his wife of more than 21 years to take her to hospital for dialysis treatment.

The widower was forced to explain to the driver, who had been sent by Arriva Transport Solutions – a firm which provides transport for NHS organisations - that his beloved partner had passed away.

He said that while the staff couldn't be more apologetic, he was disappointed by Arriva's response.

He said: 'I was in a state of shock that this could have happened, on that day of all days.

'It's bad enough to make a mistake like that on any day, let alone on Christmas Eve. I just couldn't believe it.

'I couldn't say a bad word against the two members of staff who arrived. They were dumbfounded and really apologetic.

'But I'm fuming with Arriva, because when I called them all I got was that it "wouldn't happen again", which made me madder.

Paramedics - sent Arriva Transport Solutions - had arrived to take Valerie Davidson to Swindon's Great Western Hospital for dialysis treatment but were told by her husband that she had died three months ago

'My wife was ill for quite some time and had to receive dialysis. I used to take her to the hospital myself but then she gradually got so ill that they had to take her in an ambulance.

'She gradually got worse and in September had to go into intensive care. She was far too young.'

Mrs Davidson died from Kidney failure aged 57, following a ten-year battle with breast cancer, diabetes and chronic myeloid leukaemia.

As a result of her medical conditions, in the weeks leading up to her death she had been receiving dialysis at Swindon's Great Western Hospital three times a week.

Mr Davidson said he is angry that the blunder was allowed to happen, especially on Christmas Eve

Arriva had provided her with transport to and from the hospital after she became too unwell for her husband to be able to take her himself.

After she was taken into intensive care, where she later died, the ambulances were cancelled.

However, a mistake meant she was added back onto the rota over the Christmas period.

Staff from the hospital transport services arrived at the widower's home at 6.30am on December 24.

Ed Potter, head of South West Arriva Transport Solutions, has now apologised for the mistake and said he will work to ensure it does not happen again.

He said: 'I am sorry for the distress and upset caused by the arrival of an ambulance to Mr Davidson's home.

'As a dialysis patient, Mrs Davidson was taken in and out of hospital regularly until September this year when she sadly died.

'After Mrs Davidson was admitted to hospital in September, we were notified by the hospital and suspended the bookings.

'While planning and scheduling the journeys to take place over the Christmas period, one of our journey planners reinstated the booking in error and that is why an ambulance was sent.

'The booking records have now been permanently closed to ensure this does not happen again. 

'We have contacted Mr Davidson to apologise for the error.'
