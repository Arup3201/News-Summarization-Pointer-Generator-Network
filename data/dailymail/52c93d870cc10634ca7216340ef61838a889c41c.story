England boss Roy Hodgson has urged his squad not to replicate Wayne Rooney's ill-advised break in Las Vegas before this summer's World Cup.

The Manchester United striker visited Sin City before Euro 2012 and the trip was thought by many to be the reason why he failed to hit top form for England during the tournament.

Hodgson admitted he does not want to dictate where his players go before the showpiece event in Brazil but has advised them against long-haul breaks.

'If I’m not careful, I will be 
treating all the players like children and telling them what they can 
and can’t do in their spare time,' Hodgson said on Sky Sports' 
Footballers' Football show.

'But I certainly wouldn’t encourage them to go that far away, no.

'My
 advice will be if you are going to go away with your family, keep it 
much closer to home and avoid the very, very long journeys.

'But
 whether or not I go as far as to say 'if you’ve booked a holiday to Las
 Vegas, then you can forget a place in my 23", I’m not sure I’ll go that
 far.'

Hodgson also revealed
 during the programme his job of selecting 23 players for the World Cup 
is far easier now than it would have been for Glenn Hoddle in 1998, with
 less Englishmen playing at the top level nowadays.

The
 66-year-old chooses a 30-man preliminary team for the tournament in 
Brazil in May, and must cut the squad down to 23 in June before 
England's first match against Italy in Manaus on June 14.

And
 despite insisting his selection process will change significantly over 
the next three months, the England boss claims his job is simpler than 
Hoddle's was before the World Cup in France in 1998.

'We
 talk at great length about how there aren't too many English players 
today. I've got to be honest, we're not talking about as many as we were
 in the past.

Numbers game: Hodgson will be have to whittle down his preliminary 30-man squad for the World Cup to 23

Glare of the media spotlight: Glenn Hoddle was England boss for the World Cup in France and Hodgson believes his job of selecting a squad for the tournament is far easier than it was in 1998

'Glenn's job in 1998 was harder because there was 
such a big pool to choose from. It's less difficult now because we don't
 have that enormous choice anymore.

'Our 23 if picked today would
 no doubt vary by two or three names come May because situations change.
 We don't have that many players.

'We
 do nothing else but go through names of players. My whole life, in 
tandem with Gary (Neville) and Ray (Lewington), after every weekend we 
discuss the players we've seen. Their form, how that might change, it's a
 continual process.

'There's going to be a time, of course, 
closer to the day where we have to sit down. At the moment you don't 
make decisions because you don't know what might change.'
