A British jihadist who appeared in a chilling ISIS recruitment urging young Western Muslims to give up their 'fat jobs' and fight in the Middle East has been killed, it has been claimed.

Social media accounts understood to belong to ISIS members currently fighting in the Middle East appeared to suggest that Abdul Raqib Amin - who fought under the noms de guerre Abu Bara al-Hindi and Abul Baraa - has been killed fighting Iraqi government forces in the town of Ramadi.

Former Aberdeen schoolboy Amin, now 26, was filmed alongside fellow British extremists Reyaad Khan and Nasser Muthana, both 20, urging other Muslims to fight for ISIS in the Middle East.

The Foreign Office tonight said it was impossible to verify claims that emerged on social media saying Amin was dead, but said they were aware of the reports and 'stand ready to talk to any family who may be affected.'

British jihadist: Abdul Raqib Amin - who appeared in a ISIS recruitment urging young Western Muslims to fight in the Middle East - has been been killed near the Iraqi city of Ramadi, it has been claimed

News that a British jihadist may have been by Iraqi SWAT forces while fighting for ISIS was first reported by MailOnline yesterday.

Details of Amin's alleged death were tweeted by an account understood to belong to 19-year-old British militant Abu Dujana Al Britani - a social media savvy Islamist who travelled to Syria from Portsmouth and now claims to be based in the city Homs.

Over a 
series of four messages, Dujana described how two months ago he meet two British fighters among a group of new ISIS recruits in Aleppo, which he refers to by the ancient name Halab.

He
 goes on to say that earlier this week he met with a Tunisian member of this international
 group of trainees in the city of Raqqa, where he was 
told that one of the two Britons had been killed.

Death: Abu Dujana says that the Briton was killed fighting Iraqi government troops

Claims: Abu Dujana goes on to describe the dead militant as 'very humble and pious' and says he had come to the Middle East against the advice of 'Jihadi peers' in the UK

Dujana 
goes on to name the fighter as 'Abul Baraa', describe him as 'very 
humble and pious' and says he had arrived in the Middle 
East against the advice of 'Jihadi peers' in the UK.

Abul
 Baraa is a known pseudonym of Amin and is very similar to the name Abu Bara 
al-Hindi - the moniker Amin was identified by in the ISIS recruitment 
video.

It is impossible to independently verify the alleged death of Amin, who was born in Bangladesh but settled in Scotland as a child and went to primary and secondary school in Aberdeen.

A spokesperson for the Foreign Office 
said: 'We are aware of reports of the death of a British national in 
Iraq. We stand ready to talk to any family who may be affected.

'The
 UK is deeply concerned by the growth of terrorism in Iraq and Syria, 
which threatens the people in the entire region and the UK. The UK 
advises against all travel to Syria and much of Iraq and anyone 
travelling to these areas is exposing themselves to serious risk.'

Wearing wrap-around sunglasses with a white scarf around his head and a machine gun tucked under his left arm, Amin was seen describing jihad as 'the cure for depression' in last month's ISIS recruitment video

Amin's parents are believed to have run a restaurant in Aberdeen for a number of years, before returning to Bangladesh.

Amin later moved to Leicester, where he worked various part-time jobs - including as a pizza delivery boy and in a salon.

After Amin was identified as one of the three British jihadists who appeared in the ISIS recruitment video, his friends spoke of their shock that at seeing the keen footballer and ‘hyper, energetic lad’ boast of waging holy war in the Middle East.

Wearing wrap-around sunglasses and a white scarf around his head, Amin was seen describing jihad as ‘the cure for depression’ in the video.

Speaking in front of ISIS’s black flag, he says: ‘Are you willing to sacrifice the fat job you’ve got, the big car you’ve got, the family you have? Are you willing to sacrifice this, for the sake of Allah?

‘Definitely, if you sacrifice something for Allah, Allah will give you 700 times more than this.’

After the ISIS video emerged, one person who knew 
Amin in Aberdeen said he enjoyed drinking alcohol and going to 
nightclubs as a young man, and would deal with any trouble ‘with his 
fists’.

‘He was a bit 
arrogant – a bit aggro, maybe something to prove. He ended up in a lot 
of fights,’ the man, who did not want to be identified, told the BBC.

‘To learn he’s accepted religion in such an extreme way is a bit 
shocking. Shocking because he’s a youth from Aberdeen who’s ended up 
somewhere like that.’

Amin
 attended St Machar Academy in the city and friends describe him as a 
well-integrated member of society who was a keen footballer player.

It 
is understood he lived in the north of Aberdeen, near the city’s Mosque 
and Islamic Centre. Imam Sheikh Ibrahim Alwawi said last night: ‘We are 
shocked like everyone else.’

Defence force: Iraq has sent an additional 4,000 mainly Shi'ite troops (pictured) to the embattled town of Ramadi to help bolster government forces locked in a running battle with Sunni militants

Raqqa,
 where Dujana claims to have heard news of Amin's alleged 
death, is considered the capital of the Islamic State - the name ISIS 
has given to its recently established Sunni caliphate.

The embattled city of Ramadi, on the other hand, may be in overwhelmingly Sunni territory, but remains held by the Shii'te-led Iraqi government.

The 
Shi'ite-dominated force ensuring the town remains in the hands of the 
government is made up almost entirely of reservists who answered calls 
by Iraq's leading Shia cleric Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani to take up arms 
against the brutal Sunni insurgency.

The
 government's reliance on Shi'ite troops to fight Sunni militants is 
fueling fears Iraq could descend into the kind of sectarian bloodletting
 that engulfed the country in 2006 and 2007.

Ramadi is capital of the Sunni-majority province of Anbar, much of which has fallen to ISIS forces.

Insurgents
 took control of Ramadi and the neighbouring town of Falluja earlier 
this year. The government has reestablished control of Ramadi but 
Falluja remains in militant hands.
