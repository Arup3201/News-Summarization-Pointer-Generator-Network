The Brooklyn cop killer is believed to have carried the gun he used to shoot dead two officers in a Styrofoam food container as he calmly walked through the city streets, according to investigators.

Ismaaiyl Brinsley left the box at the scene after he murdered NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu - but no food was found inside, according to a new report on Wednesday by The Daily Beast. 

NYPD investigators are trying to piece together Brinsley's movements on December 20 in the hours before he walked up to the officers shortly before 3pm and shot them at point-blank range  in their patrol car in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood.

Surveillance footage from December 20 revealed cop killer Ismaaiyl Brinsley casually strolling through Brooklyn carrying a fast-food container. Investigators now believe that the handgun was inside 

Ismaaiyl Brinsley shot two New York police officers as they sat in their car in Brooklyn before taking his own life in a subway station 

Brinsley then ran into a nearby subway station and took his own life with the same gun.  

One senior investigator told The Daily Beast that colleagues of the two slain officers felt it was their duty to piece together that terrible day. 

'This is the highest honor a detective can have, investigating the murder of a fellow police officer,' the investigator reportedly said. 

Surveillance footage uncovered by the NYPD revealed Brinsley chatting on a cellphone while casually sauntering around carrying a white plastic bag which appears to be covering a container. 

He appeared to be attempting to hold the container upright and steady on the footage from the Atlantic Terminal Mall. 

At one point Brinsley used his back to open a glass door rather than upset the container. 

Police now believe that Brinsley's semi-automatic handgun was inside the entire time as he made his two-mile journey through Brooklyn.

The footage showed the killer backing through a glass door at the mall as if afraid to upset the container. Investigators now believe that Brinsley was carrying a handgun in the box 

On the morning of December 20, Brinsley shot his ex-girlfriend and posted an online death threat against police, according to investigators in Maryland.

They used cellphone-tracking technology to follow his journey, via bus, to New York City in real time.

He was tracked using the GPS transmitter on a cellphone he had stolen from his ex-girlfriend.

Along the way, he posted threatening messages on social media including a vow to 'put wings on pigs'. 

The transmissions, or 'pings,' showed he was traveling northbound on a bus on Interstate 95 that arrived in Manhattan at 10.49am. 

He then took the subway to Brooklyn, where he used the stolen phone to make posts to Instagram.

One showed his bloodied green shoe. The other showed his pistol. 'I'm Putting Wings On Pigs Today They Take 1 Of Ours...... Let's Take 2 of Theirs #ShootThePolice,' he wrote.

At 12:07pm, Brinsley ditched the phone near the Barclays Center arena and disappeared.

Baltimore County police said they became aware of the Instagram postings at about 1.30pm. 

They first tried calling a precinct in Coney Island but were told to call the precinct in the Flatbush neighborhood and had a conversation with police there around 2.10pm.

Police say the flier with Brinsley's photo was then faxed, at the NYPD's request, to a Brooklyn command at 2:46pm. It warned that he was in Brooklyn, armed with a semi-automatic handgun and was saying online that 'he will shoot a police officer today.'

Two minutes later, Brinsley opened fire. 

Moments later, he committed suicide - likely around the same time the Teletype was sent to NYPD headquarters in Manhattan.

Police on both ends say they took immediate and proper measures to try to alert officers about an armed and dangerous fugitive bent on violence against law enforcement. 

But the seemingly antiquated way they did it has raised questions about the potential for communication lapses to hamper urgent manhunts.

Though refusing to fault how the warning was handled, Commissioner Bratton has called it 'an irony' the ambush occurred a time when the NYPD has launched a $160 million program to equip each member of the 35,000-officer force with a department-issued computer tablet or smartphone to improve information-sharing.

Message: A wanted flier for Brinsley came too late, and was sent a mere two minutes before Brinsley walked up to a patrol car and shot the two NYPD officers without warning 

Currently, police departments in New York, Los Angeles, Denver and elsewhere mostly rely on dispatchers to make radio transmissions giving descriptions of suspects or fliers - copied and faxed - with mug shots passed out at roll calls. 

Smaller forces have gone to blasting notifications to department-issued smartphones, but most larger ones say to do the same would be too expensive. 

In the case of Brinsley, it's impossible to know whether an earlier warning would have made a difference.

Even if that information had been received earlier, all an officer sitting in a radio car would have received, Bratton said, 'was an alert on the description of a black male, mid-20s, that basically is making threats against police officers'. 

NYPD officers  stand for a moment of silence to mark the murders of two of their fellow officers. One investigator of the shootings reportedly said: 'This is the highest honor a detective can have, investigating the murder of a fellow police officer'
