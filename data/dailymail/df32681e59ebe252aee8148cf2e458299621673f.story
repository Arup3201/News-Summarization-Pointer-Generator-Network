A 23-year-old university student was allegedly strangled to death by her 32-year-old boyfriend on Thanksgiving Day after the pair got into a 'heated' argument.

Shannon Jones, from Potomac, Maryland, was choked by Benjamin Cayea until 'her face was blue and she had no pulse' at an apartment near Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, police said.

Cayea then reportedly climbed into his girlfriend's car and drove to his friend Jacob Ives's home in a neighboring town, where he parked the vehicle and called Mr Ives in a 'hysterical' state.

A few seconds later, a concerned Mr Ives came out of his house to find Cayea rocking back-and-forth in the driver's seat while 'breathing fast and heavy', it is alleged.

When Mr Ives asked his friend what was wrong, he reportedly replied: 'She [Shannon] would not stop coming at me, she would not stop yelling. I did it, I choked her.'

Mr Ives then convicted Cayea to enter his apartment - where the suspect allegedly collapsed on the kitchen floor and curled up into a ball - before calling 911, according to ABC7. 

Police arrived at the Cayuga Heights apartment on Thursday night and found Miss Jones lying dead on the floor of an upstairs bedroom. The Churchill High School graduate was dressed in a bathrobe.

Following the discovery, Cayea was arrested and arraigned on second-degree murder charges in the Village of Cayuga Heights Court. His court-appointed attorney entered a plea of not guilty.

During a police interview, the suspect reportedly admitted killing his half-Turkish girlfriend following a 'heated' argument, the cause of which remains unknown.

On Monday, Mr Ives told the news station that the couple had been together for around two years and had a turbulent history. 'They have been together on and off since that time,' he said.

But he said he was stunned by Cayea's alleged violence, saying: 'I have know Ben for about 17 years. Because of his religion, I thought him incapable of violence. He is a Buddhist.'

Miss Jones, a senior in Cornell's College of Engineering who was due to graduate next year, has been described by friends and relatives as an intelligent, lively and kind student.

'For Shannon it was knowledge and it was the pursuit of academics and the pursuit to try to better herself,' her younger brother, John Jones, said. 

'She always put in the extra effort and she always made sure that she put in the time to do what she needed to do.'

She was also keen dancer and a member of Teszia Belly Dance Troupe. Last week, the troupe took to Facebook to express its grief at the death of a 'beautiful and talented' member.

It posted: 'Shannon, you will be missed so dearly by your Teszia family, as well as by everyone who was lucky enough to see you grace the stage.

'We know you will be with us whenever we dance. Rest in peace, beautiful Shannon. All the love in the world to you and your family.'

Cayea is being held without bail in Tompkins County Jail. He is due to appear in court on Tuesday.
