Wicked Campers is in hot water again four months after the company promised to remove offensive slogans and art work from its vehicles.

Tourists in Far North Queensland have been shocked to see one of the controversial vans parked at popular visitors spots featuring cartoon penises styled according to different racial stereotypes.

The van also features the slogan: 'My c**k just died. Can I bury it in your backyard...'

Dot Miller saw the van when she was visiting Millaa Millaa Falls, south of Cairns, with her daughter on Saturday and said she thought it was 'awful', the Cairns Post reported.

'I'd be upset if my grandson had hired it,' Ms Miller told the Post.

'I would think it's quite offensive to most people. I can't work out why anyone would do it.'

The van features images of male genitalia dressed up next to the names of countries, including 'Africa' which is styled with a bone through its hair, 'Israel' which is wearing an Orthodox Jewish hat and hairstyle and 'Cuba' which is fashioned to look like a cigar.

The 'Australia' cartoon is a picture of Tony Abbott.

On the other side of the van is a 'Jamaica' cartoon penis with dreadlocks, 'Japan' wearing a sumo wrestler belt, 'Egypt' wrapped up like a mummy,' 'Mexico' with a sombrero and mustache and England wearing a top hat, bow tie and carrying an umbrella.

The van is currently rented out and on its way to Sydney. 

A spokeswoman for the Advertising Standards Bureau said the organisation was aware of the van - which also advertises the Wicked Campers website - but was unable to act unless it received an official complaint.

This comes after Sydney mum Paula Orbea launched an online petition for the company to remove offensive slogans which reached over 127,000 signatures in only four days in July.

Following the petition Ms Orbea said the company promised it would review and remove sexist and misogynistic marketing from all of its vans within the next six months.

Apart from offering a personal apology, Wicked Campers also said in the statement that it has removed the original phrase that led Ms Orbea to create the petition when her 11-year-old daughter repeated it to her word-for-word - 'In every princess, there's a little slut who wants to try it just once'.

The apology, which is published in full on Ms Orbea's blog under a post she titled 'My daughter thanks you too', reads:

'Anybody who is familiar with our brand would probably know that we are strong proponents of free speech and pushing the limits of humour – we are a "cash for chaos" kind of company.

In July the company promised it would remove sexist and misogynistic marketing from vans within six months

'As is often quoted "A sense of humour is a sense of proportion". And in this instance, we admit that we have taken things out of proportion and out of the realms of what is considered to be "socially acceptable".'

It continues with: 'Wicked Campers Owner, John Webb wishes to acknowledge the prevailing community opinion by REMOVING the slogan in question and making a commitment over the coming six months to changing slogans of an insensitive nature.

'In the spirit of being "actionist", Wicked Campers also invites anybody who feels strongly offended by a slogan to either paint or tape over it.'

Ms Orbea said she was overjoyed at the result, calling it a 'people power win'.

'It was an overwhelming show of community support,' Ms Orbea said in July.

This is the phrase Ms Orbea heard her 11-year-old daughter say word for word before starting the petition

'The kind of sexism and misogyny on those Wicked Campers vans isn't trivial – it's degrading to women, harmful for our children to consume, and condones a rape culture that sees one-in-three Australian women sexually assaulted in their lifetimes.

'I'm pleased my daughter said something, and that we stood up against it. It's important that we call out sexism wherever it exists.'

In a blog post, Ms Orbea gave thanks to everyone that had supported her petition as well as outlining the reasons for her protest.

'My motives never were, nor do they continue to be, about bringing down Wicked Campers – it was to remove certain morally offensive slogans,' she wrote.

'In fact, if this petition causes the company to reevaluate their business model to better fit the ethical standards of society – well, wouldn't that be the best victory of all?' 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Wicked Campers for comment. 

The company said it was a strong proponent of free speech and pushing the limits of humour
