This bewildered catfish was well and truly caught out when a giant osprey swooped in and snapped it out of the water.

The startled fish almost looks as if it is crying out in terror as the bird of prey takes off with its dinner between its talons.

Clutching the hapless catfish tightly as it soared over the Gulf of Mexico, the majestic bird was seen flying back to its nest to tuck into its hard-earned meal.

Caught: This giant osprey swooped in ad caught this bewildered catfish near Sanibel Island, off the western coast of Florida

Startled: The catfish appears to cry for help as it is carried hundreds of feet above the water in the Gulf of Mexico in August

Catch of the day: The osprey, which can fly at speeds of up to 80mph, made a quick getaway back to its nest to devour its dinner

The jaw-dropping pictures of predator and prey were taken by schoolboy Oli Armstrong who was visiting Sanibel Island, off the west coast of Florida, on holiday in August.

The 15-year-old from Nailsea, North Somerset, said he was lucky to capture the shots but is now considering a career in photography.

He said: 'I just caught it out of the corner of my eye and grabbed the camera.

'I didn't have much time to think, I just pointed and shot, thankfully it was in 'sport mode' and kept going.

'It was a lucky accident really, but it really made my day and the holiday. I may consider following a career in photography.'

Sanibel Island is renowned for its wildlife and is home to a wide variety of birds as well as alligators, turtles, wild cats and shellfish. More than half of the island is made up of animal refuges. 

Predator and prey: Ospreys, which have wingspans of up to 5ft 9ins, often disappear under water for a brief moment as they dive in to catch large fish

Dinner: The stunning photos of the osprey catching its food were taken by 15-year-old schoolboy Oli Armstrong, from Nailsea, North Somerset

Majestic: Ospreys have a unique style of hunting which sees them hover about 60ft above the surface of the water as they wait for the perfect moment to swoop

Bird of prey: The osprey clutched the hapless catfish tightly as it soared over the Gulf of Mexico earlier this year

Ospreys have a unique style of hunting which sees them hover about 60ft above the surface of the water as they wait for the perfect moment to swoop.

As they dive, the plummeting birds switch at the last second to a feet-first position, for an impact that makes a bigger splash and often disappear below the surface for a brief moment. 

Backwards-facing scales on their talons act as barbs to hold their catch tight and they have closable nostrils to keep water out as they dive. 

The fish-eating birds have a wing span of more than 5ft 9in, allowing them to reach speeds of up to 80mph.
