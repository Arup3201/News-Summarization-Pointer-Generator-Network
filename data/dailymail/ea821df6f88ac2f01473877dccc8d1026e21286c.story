An angry owl who viciously swooped down on four unsuspecting joggers in an Oregon park has inspired a host of bright yellow signs to warn passers-by of his impending attack.

The quirky warning signs initially debuted as a gag on  The Rachel Maddow show on MSNBC after she got word of the attacks and had the signs mocked up.

Maddow jokingly suggested that the city of Salem should post the vivid sign using the iconic pedestrian stick figure running from an owl which has its claws extended.

But the signs were no laughing matter to Salem City council after they received them from MSNBC   as they have decided to adopt them.

Beware: The city of Salem signs show  the iconic pedestrian stick figure running from an owl which has its claws extended

The City of Salem is now posting the unusual signs near a park and popular jogging hill, warning people that the angry owl could stage a silent attack and swoop  at any moment.  

At least four people have already been scratched by the aggressive owl over the past couple of months near Bush's Pasture Park and Soap Box Derby hill, according to KGW.com

One jogger said the bird swiped his longtime running cap off his head and nicked his scalp. 

Another jogger, a surgeon, said the owl hit him twice in Bush's Pasture Park in Salem, and it was so hard that he thought he was having a stroke or an aneurysm.

But after the surgeon saw Maddow's sign on TV he decided to create T-shirts of it and is now selling them online.

Mark Becktel, parks and transportation services manager, said the city secured rights to reproduce the sign and is posting 20 of them.

'It's just making people aware that there's an owl there that for whatever reason swoops down and goes after people's hats,' he said.

Tweet: Officials from the City of Salem tweeted 'It started off as a gag on the Rachel Maddow show but the city plans to install these signs'

Yet, the attacks have become so well known that the owl even has its own hashtag on Twitter #angryowl.

One user called Blocked by Chick tweeted: 'We don't care how angry the owls get. We refuse to run like that. #Oregon #angryowl'

The local paper, the Statesman Journal has also joined in on the fun with an online naming contest with 'Owlcapone' getting 238 votes and Owlpachino landing a respectable 177 votes.

Wildlife experts suggest that the barred owl is not a local and comes from outside of the area.

It's also thought that the owl, with a reported four foot wing span, has been staging the attacks to protect a nest.

Keith Keever a representative from the Parks Operations Division said some members of the national Audubon society think that there could be more than one bird behind the sneak attack.

He said: 'One person thought that there was a bird at one of the owl life refuges that maybe someone released, but to be released in the middle of Salem is not likely.

'It is suspected that it's a matting pair establishing in a new area.' 

Official said the 'angry owl' warning signs will include special vandal-proof fasteners to keep people from stealing the signs.

All of the signs will also have a sticker on the back that thanks the Maddow Show and gives credit to its producers.

Barred Owls are known to become aggressive during mating season or when they are defending a nest.
