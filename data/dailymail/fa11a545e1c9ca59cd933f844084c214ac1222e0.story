A McDonald's customer was 'disgusted' when she discovered what appeared to be covered in beard trimmings in her McMuffin.

April Gilmour, 24 from Kilmarnock, had already eaten half of the breakfast snack when she noticed the thick short dark hairs.

The furious mother-of-two said she felt 'sick to her stomach' after making the gruesome discovery and posted a picture of the hairy sausage and egg McMuffin on Facebook on Wednesday which has now been shared more than 600 times.

Mrs Gilmour believes the hair came from a staff member at her local McDonald's on Armour Street in Kilmarnock, Scotland, after she claimed the manager ran a 'clean shaven' policy.

She wrote on Facebook: 'This was my sausage and egg McMuffin from McDonald's in Kilmarnock this morning.

'I had eaten half of it and opened it up to put more sauce in and noticed it was full of hair shavings. Disgusting! 

'The manager told me they operate a clean shave policy - well clearly some wee radge has shaved all over their uniform and it's fell into my breakfast.'

The beautician added: 'It's obviously an accident but I feel sick to my stomach thinking about it.'

An area manager for McDonald's in Kilmarnock confirmed April had been in touch with the Armour Street branch of the restaurant about her McMuffin. 

Mrs Gilmour and her husband Ross, 25, said the experience had put them off McDonalds food for life.

'It's cheap junk anyway, but this is even more reason not to buy it,' said Mr Gilmour.

'It's definitely put us off for life. April felt disgusted.

'She had just got it and had gone to sit and eat it in her car when she found the hairs. She told the manager who was apologetic but said he could clearly see the hair in it.

'April decided to post the picture of it thinking we could warn people.'

The picture of the McMuffin sparked a host of comments on Facebook, with one of her friends, called Sammi Rankin, writing: 'Do you normally have beard for breakfast ? You've ate someone's facial hair.'

Katie Glass wrote: 'Beware of the hairy burger and eggs - you could be next.'

Fi Balloch wrote: 'Man shavings.' 

While Kerri Campbell added: 'Boak. That would put anyone off.' 

A spokesman for McDonald's said: 'Ms Gilmour has been sent a letter of apology which should be with her tomorrow.

'We are sorry for her experience when visiting our restaurant. Food safety is our highest priority and both our restaurants and our suppliers place great emphasis on food hygiene and following rigorous standards in order to avoid imperfections in our products.

 'We have launched an investigation following the reporting of this incident.'

In January, fast food chain KFC apologised to an Ayrshire customer who found a deep fried feather in her barbecued chicken meal.

It had apparently gone unnoticed as staff rolled the meat in its coating, put it through the fryer, left it to drain, and then put it in a box for serving.
