A church in Canada is searching for a new vicar – but he must be able to speak Welsh.

The 300-strong congregation at the Dewi Sant (St David) United Church in Toronto is made up of Welsh expats but their minister has returned home.

A spokesman said: ‘We want to continue and grow the Welsh culture in Toronto. We are an active and lively Welsh church and our mission is to help preserve and celebrate Welsh culture in Canada.’

Keeping it Welsh: The Dewi Sant (St David) United Church in Toronto

The church, set up in 1907 by two Christians from North Wales, holds services in Welsh and even teaches the language to new worshippers.

Latest census figures for Toronto show there are about 50,000 people living in the city who identify themselves as Welsh.

Parishioner Hefina Phillips said: ‘We wear our identity with pride.’

Preservation: The church wants to grow the Welsh culture in Toronto

Described as one of the only remaining Welsh language church in Toronto, Ontario, it is thought to be one of the few in North America still holding services in the traditional celtic dialect.

It has turned to newspapers in Wales to advertise the vacancy after attempts to promote the role on their own website proved fruitless after 10 months.

The ideal candidate must be able to conduct the church's Welsh-language service on the first Sunday evening of the month.
