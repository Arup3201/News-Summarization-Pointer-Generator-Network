Davis ran for mayor in 2007 and for District 10 supervisor in 2010. He has been arrested twice for public nudity.

He was detained last year at a demonstration in San Francisco protesting an ordinance banning public nudity.

In that incident, the SF Gate quoted Davis as he was taken into a police van: 'Freedom of expression is dead in this country.'
