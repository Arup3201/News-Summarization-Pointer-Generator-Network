A police horse punched by a football thug has been back in action this weekend keeping the peace at a rally by the far-Right English Defence League.

Bud, who belongs to the West Yorkshire force, was hit by a Newcastle United fan following the team’s defeat to arch-rivals Sunderland last month.

But Bud returned to duty on the streets of Newcastle yesterday as part of a major operation to keep the peace between EDL supporters and their opponents.

His presence was specially requested by Northumbria Police, which had been planning its operation for months.

Bud suffered no lasting harm from the punch, for which a  45-year-old man was arrested, and was inundated with gifts sent to his stables by wellwishers.

Despite heightened tensions after the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby, the march passed off without major incident.
