The North-South divide in property prices has widened in the six years since the financial crisis began.

While homes in London have increased in value by almost 50 per cent, those in swathes of England and Wales are still worth less than they were before the recession.

But the chance of those prices recovering is receding, with further evidence that the market across the country is beginning to slow.

Property prices in London have soared since the recession while the north has seen stagnation 

Property values in the West Midlands, East Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside, North West and Wales have still not reached pre-crisis levels, LSL Property Services claims.

But prices in London have soared by 47.3 per cent over the same period, with the average home jumping from £392,629 at the previous peak in February 2008, to £578,377 in September.

If Greater London and the South East are excluded, average house prices across England and Wales grew at just 4.5 per cent. If they are included, they grew at 10.6 per cent. 

The figures highlight the stark North/South divide among UK homeowners, and come amid further evidence that the property market across the country is beginning to slow.

David Newnes, director of Reeds Rains and Your Move estate agents – part of LSL Property Services – said: ‘For six years regions of the UK, average property prices achieved on completion are yet to match their pre-crisis score – and a North/South divide in the field remains evident in the race back from the debris of the financial crash.’

The south west in September became just the fourth region in the UK to ‘scramble out from under the shadow of the financial crisis’, says the report - after London, the South East and East Anglia.

The sobering evidence of the mixed fortunes of homeowners in different parts of the country comes amid fresh evidence that the recovery in the housing market has started to fizzle out.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney has described 'excessive household debt' as a major economic risk

The Council of Mortgage Lenders yesterday revealed that lending dropped 8pc to £18.1billion in August, compared with £19.1billion in July – although lending is up 9pc over the year.

Separate figures released by the Bank of England earlier this week showed that lenders reported the biggest fall in credit they were able to supply since the last three months of 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed.

It attributed this to stricter lending rules introduced in April, as well as concerns about the outlook for house prices.

But it said mortgage lending is likely to pick up again in the remainder of the year. Experts have said fears of an imminent hike in interest rates have also poured cold water on the property market as people have become more nervous about buying a house or remortgaging.

According to the Bank, mortgage lending in August fell to a three-month low, and major mortgage lender Nationwide has reported that house prices fell in September, the first month-on-month drop in 17 months.

Paul Smee, director general of the CML, commented: ‘The lending climate had a glass half full, glass half empty feel about it in August. Overall, these figures give no support to any fears of a developing bubble in housing.’

Bank of England governor Mark Carney has decribed excessive household debt as the ‘greatest risk to the domestic economy’ and has introduced measures to restrict big home loans.

It might be harder to secure a mortgage than ever before, but that doesn't necessarily mean you should just take whatever you are offered. Locking down the right one is essential to making sure buying a home is as affordable as possible.
