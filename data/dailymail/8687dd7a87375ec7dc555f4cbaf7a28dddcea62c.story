Controversial Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is stepping down after six years in office.

The Republican, who was a staunch critic of President Obama and his administration, delivered one last parting shot at him before she left, branding him a 'failed president.'

Brewer told Fox News: 'He's been a very big disappointment to me. I think he has done things that certainly we would never have expected any president to do by executive order and because he says so.'

The Arizona governor has spent the last few years locked in legal battles with the Obama administration mainly over provisions in her state's strict immigration bill, SB1070.

But the federal courts have rejected many provisions in the bill as unconstitutional. 

This week, a federal court went against Brewer's efforts to deny driver's licenses to young undocumented immigrants known as 'dreamers,' according to Fox News.

During her time in office, Brewer worked tirelessly to shore up the Arizona-Mexico border, but called it one of her biggest disappointments that she hadn't been able to do more.

She said she wanted to make it a crime for immigrants to be in Arizona without the proper documentation, but that proposal was struck down too.

However, she has rejected criticism that she is 'racist' for her policies.

'Those of us born and raised in the southwest are not racists,' she insisted. 

'Those people are our neighbors. We go to church with us. Their children go to school. They marry into our families. This has nothing to do with racism. The bottom line is the rule of law and what it is doing to our country.' 

Under an Obama administration program, the immigrants are now allowed to remain in the country.

Arizona was one of the last states in the country where officials refused to issue driver's licenses to young immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. 

But she criticized Obama for implementing his immigration policies, via executive action, to suspend deportations and give work permits to potentially millions of illegal immigrants. 

This was just one of several sticking points for Brewer who attempted to keep her state's strict   immigration policies in place.

Brewer, who was famously caught on camera wagging her finger in the president's face on an airport tarmac, said she had no regrets over the interaction, which some saw as 'disrespectful.'
