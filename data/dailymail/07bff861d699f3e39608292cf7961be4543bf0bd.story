A womenswear brand which offers a wider variety of larger sizes targeted at the 'average' woman has reported an impressive boost in sales  after it rebranded in order to drop the plus size label from its official name.

Hey Gorgeous, a New York-based online retailer which sells a range of larger labels for women, was formerly known Madison Plus Select before undergoing an official name change in May last year, after its founder, Aimee Cheshire, noticed how successful plus size model Robyn Lawley's swimwear range had become - because the size 8 to 18 designs were targeted at 'average' women rather than plus size customers specifically.

'We did find that a lot of women, especially [those who are] sizes 14 [or] 16, do not identify themselves as plus-sized, so they are just living life as they are and they can fit into some clothes, or can't,' she told Fashionista.

Thinking outside the box: Aimee Cheshire (pictured), founder of online retailer Hey Gorgeous, chose to rebrand her company, dropping the 'plus' from its former name in order to target women of all shapes and sizes

'We also found that customers do not necessarily want the term 'plus' in the name of the brand because then it will be calling them out to what they are and not everyone has embraced their size.'

Mrs Cheshire added that many women don't want to feel as though they are browsing specifically for plus size labels and find it easier to share clothing recommendations with one another when they don't have to categorize them so specifically by size.

Her insight into the minds of her customers is certainly paying off. 

Since rebranding, the company has seen a big boost in the number of women flocking to its site, with Mrs Cheshire explaining that many of those women who would normally avoid 'plus size' retailers and brands, feeling more comfortable about browsing through the site.

Interestingly, the site has also seen big increase in the number of customers who appear to be recommending the retailer to their friends and neighbors, proving Mrs Cheshire's theory that people feel more comfortable sharing clothing options when they aren't labeled so obviously.

'I've seen orders [from people living] on the same street which is neat, because this woman must have told that woman,' she added.

And Mrs Cheshire is not the only one embracing the idea of abandoning the 'plus size' label altogether. 

In recent months there has been a huge increase in the number of brands opting to extend their regular size ranges in order to include a wider variety of options, rather than branching out and creating a separate line targeted specifically at larger customers.

When Fashion Police co-host Kelly Osbourne announced the launch of her 13-piece fashion line for online retailer HSN, she insisted that it be available in sizes 0 to 24 in order to ensure it was marketable to all women, no matter what their shape.

'Because I have been everything from a size 0 to pretty much almost a 16, depending on the brand, it made me realize all the tricks I had learned to cover up certain areas or to detract from certain areas, and what I like in clothing,' she told WWD.com.

'It’s really unfair that America has this disillusion that the most common size is size 14, and that’s only because that’s as big as most fashion designers go.'

Similarly, Target recently announced that it would be including a range of larger sizes in its upcoming collaboration with American fashion house Lilly Pulitzer, saying in a statement: 'It’s really important for us that we can provide stylish apparel for everybody, and we felt like this collection was the right time to do it.

'This project is so democratic. When we do these collaborations, there’s a certain group of people that always really respond to them.

'But this, anybody can wear this. There’s just such a range that anyone can find something that they love.'
