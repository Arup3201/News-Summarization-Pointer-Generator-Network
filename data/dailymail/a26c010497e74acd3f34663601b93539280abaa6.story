Paris Hilton's younger brother Barron was reportedly in hospital on Sunday after a brawl broke out at the hotel heiress' rented beach house in Malibu, California.

The fight involved former Baywatch star Jeremy Jackson, 33, who claimed he was attacked and struck in the head with a bottle about 2am by Paris, her friend Brandon Davis and others.

Reality star Jasmine Waltz reportedly hit Jackson in the head with a bottle after he and a few friends entered the beach house uninvited and things turned sour, according to a report in TMZ based on information from Hilton's camp.

Beach house brawl: Jeremy Jackson, shown in Los Angeles in September, claimed he was viciously attacked on Sunday morning by Paris Hilton and others at her rented out beach house in Malibu, California during a brawl that left Barron Hilton, shown in February in New York City, reportedly hospitalised

The brawl was first reported by TMZ which published a photo of Jeremy showing his left eye swollen and bloody.

A representative for 33-year-old Paris told TMZ that five or six people were at the beach house when Jackson and a few of his friends walked in uninvited.

Davis asked the unwelcome guests to leave but Jackson allegedly became surly and said, 'Don't you know who I am? I was on Baywatch and Celebrity Rehab.'

Jackson allegedly grabbed a man and started choking him and several people rushed to subdue him, including recent UK Celebrity Big Brother contestant Jasmine who reportedly struck Jackson over the head with a vodka bottle.

Barron Hilton remained in the hospital on Sunday after bleeding and receiving stitches, according to TMZ.

JacksonÂ  called the people who attacked him 'degenerate fame whores,' including Paris and Brandon.

'There were literally going Rodney King on my a**,' Jackson told TMZ.

Law enforcement sources said they received a call from two people with each claiming they were attacked by the other, according to TMZ.

No one wanted to press charges when police arrived at the beach house Paris has been renting for $65,000 a month, so no arrest was made.

Jackson is best known for portraying Hobie Buchannon on the popular television show Baywatch.

MailOnline contacted Paris Hilton for comment and is awaiting a response.

Hilton is a longtime friend of Davis, who is the grandson of the late oil baron Marvin Davis.

Davis was caught on video in 2006 making fun of Hilton frenemy Lindsay Lohan who he infamously called 'firecrotch' in a lengthy rant against the actress as Hilton cackled along.

Paris Hilton's brother Barron, 24, was struck in the face in December during a violent attack at a party held as part of the Miami Art Basel event.

Barron was assaulted allegedly at the direction of Lohan, who accused him of talking about her to her boyfriend at the party.

His sister Paris angrily stepped up to support her beaten brother and declared the perpetrator would be made to 'pay'.

New York City writer Ray Lemoine admitted striking Hilton but blamed the incident on Barron for refusing to leave the party and instigating the physical contact.

No charges have been filed in connection with the December assault.
