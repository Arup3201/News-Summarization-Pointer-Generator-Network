Ashley Cole seems to have fully immersed himself into his new side, posing in the middle of his Roma team-mates after their 2-1 win at Parma on Wednesday night.

The Englishman, who had been on the periphery of a team photo in the summer, was put in the mix of the team photo taken on the visitors' plane.

Cole was an unused substitute in the game, which kept up Roma’s 100 per cent record for the season so far.

A spectacular late Miralem Pjanic free kick gave Roma the win after Adem Ljajic had put the visitors in front and Paolo De Ceglie had levelled for Parma.

Roma were on the point of dropping their first points of the season until Pjanic scored with a dipping free kick with two minutes to go.

Roma were without eight injured players, including key midfielder Daniele De Rossi and newly signed forward Juan Iturbe.

When he first arrived at the club, this photo was posted with Cole awkwardly standing beside his team-mates

The first photo lead to a string of  jokes online, and even Cole's Roma team-mate Francesco Totti got involved

But it was captain Francesco Totti, who turns 38 this week, who set up Ljajic's goal by leaving the Serbian forward with only the goalkeeper to beat.

Antonio Cassano threatened for Parma in the 54th and then De Sceglie rose above Roma's defense to redirect in a corner.

The match appeared headed for a draw until Pjanic showed off his free-kick expertise by curling a shot over Parma's wall that went in off the underside of the crossbar.
