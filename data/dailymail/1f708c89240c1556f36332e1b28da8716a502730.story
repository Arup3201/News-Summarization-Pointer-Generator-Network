A nursery worker dropped four dress sizes after bending over to clean up a spill and splitting her trousers.

Gillian Davie, 39, dropped from a size 18 to a trim size 10 after the 'awkward incident' happened while she was at work one day.

The embarrassment prompted her to shed over four stone, from 13st 7lbs to 9st 8lbs.

Gillian Davie, 39, lost four stone and dropped four dress sizes after being embarrassed when she bent over at work and her trousers ripped

Gillian says: 'I can laugh about it now, but one day at work I spilled some water in the kitchen and when I bent down to mop it up, I heard this huge rip and there was a large split in my trousers.

'It was so embarrassing and, what was even worse, was that one of my colleagues was also in the kitchen and saw the whole thing.

'She must have felt sorry for me because she kindly lent me her jumper so I could tie it around my waist to cover it up. That was the moment I knew I has to do something about my weight.'

The road to losing weight has been a difficult one for Gillian, and it has taken almost four years to shift the pounds

Gillian, from Langlees near Falkirk, in Stirlingshire, who once weighed in at more than 13-and-a-half stone, started weight-loss program All About Weight in August 2009, and recorded a 5lb weight loss at her first weigh in.

She now weighs nine stone eight lbs. She said: 'It was always so hard to find nice things to wear and I used to hide myself in baggy clothes and tracksuits.'

Gillian Davies is a nursery worker from Langlees near Falkirk in Scotland, and she says she was shamed into losing four stone after ripping her trousers at work and having to borrow a jumper from a colleague to hide the tear

'Because the majority of my clothes had elasticated waistbands, I didn't see the weight piling on. It really dented my confidence and it took me a long time to realise I was unhappy.

OLD GILLIAN

Breakfast: Nothing

Snack: Blueberry muffin and chocolate

Lunch: Chips

Snack: Whatever children in nursery were eating

Dinner: Ready meal

NEW GILLIAN

Breakfast: Wholesome, healthy meal

Lunch: Soup

Dinner: Chicken

'I just got to the point where I had to do something about it. A lot of my friends are very slim, which put additional pressure on me, but after such a successful first week, I knew that the new me was in my sights.

Gillian explained that simply slipping into bad habits led to her being overweight since her late twenties.

She said: 'I used to skip breakfast because I had to leave home at either 5.30 or 6.00am to travel to work in Glasgow.

'When I arrived I'd get a blueberry muffin and hot chocolate almost every day, and it quickly became a habit, just like having snacks with the kids at nursery in the afternoon.

'Most lunchtimes I would pay the local chip shop a visit and have a ready meal in the evening, simply for convenience.'

Gillian'’s diet now consists of a healthy breakfast, soup for lunch and chicken for dinner most nights.

'I’m much more aware of the nutritional value of food and my portions are a lot smaller.

'I
feel so much healthier and happier in myself and have a lot more energy
to go out and do the things I like, such as meet up with friends or go 
for long walks.

Her 84-year-old grandma, Peggy, was also impressed with Gillian’s weight loss - and her granddaughter now receives nice compliments when she goes to visit.

Gillian added: 'Peggy doesn’t mince her 
words, and having previously commented on how big I was, she says how 
much healthier I look these days.

'It’s gone totally in the opposite direction - now she doesn’t think I am eating enough!

'I reassure her that I have a much healthier diet than I did before and am never hungry.

Gillian said: 'People have told me that I look amazing - I don't think any woman will ever tire of hearing that'

'People have told me that I look amazing - I don’t think any woman will ever tire of hearing that.

Gillian
explained how she had recently went for her first every spray tan - 
something she would never have done when she was big.

She added: 'I just feel so confident and happier in myself and have even been inspired to buy a bicycle. I can’t wait to get out there once the weather improves and enjoy life as the new me.'

Gillian Davie, holding the trousers she can no longer fit into after losing all the weight, says: 'All my clothes used to have elastic waistbands'
