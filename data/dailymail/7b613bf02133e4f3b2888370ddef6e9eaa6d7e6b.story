Leonardo Ulloa proved he still has a soft-spot for former club Brighton after sitting with the away fans at White Hart Lane for the Seagulls' Capital One Cup clash with Tottenham.

The Argentine, who left Brighton to join newly-promoted Leicester City last summer, posed for pictures with supporters as he watched his old club in action on Wednesday evening.

Leonardo Ulloa isn't the first footballer to cheer a club from the stands. Sportsmail takes a look at a few others who have supported their club with fans...

Ashley Young - Newcastle vs Manchester United - October 2012

Jordan Henderson - Manchester City vs Sunderland - March 2014

Kyle Walker - Sheffield United vs Yeovil Town - May 2013

Steffen Freund - Manchester United vs Tottenham 2005

Steven Gerrard - Aston Villa vs Liverpool 2010

Tony Hibbert - Oldham vs Everton 2013 

But the £8million striker was left disappointed as second-half goals from Erik Lamela and Harry Kane sent the Premier League side into the quarter-finals of the competition.

The 28-year-old enjoyed a prolific 18 months with the south coast side before leaving for the Foxes, scoring 26 goals in 58 appearances after joining from Spanish side Almeria in January, 2013.

He has since made an instant impact at the King Power stadium, netting five times in nine Premier League appearances including a brace in Leicester's 5-3 win against Manchester United.

Ulloa isn't the first top-flight star to watch a match alongside the fans. Ashley Young joined Manchester United supporters at St James' Park back in October 2012, while Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson sat with the Sunderland faithful at Wembley for their Capital One Cup final loss to Manchester City in March this year.
