The company's oldest employee Roger Crathorne has spent his life working for Land Rover, starting as an engineer apprentice 50 years ago in 1963.

The 66-year-old said: 'I grew up on the same street as the Land Rover factory in Solihull, West Midlands, and I knew when I was a teenager I wanted to work for them.

'I got an apprenticeship as an engineer when I was just 16 and had to wait until I was 21 until I was fully qualified - this is now my 50th year.'

Around 150 heritage cars from all over the UK were showcased at the Packington Estate, just six miles from its Solihull homeland to mark the anniversary.

The estate was the testing ground for the original 1947-48 Land Rover prototypes through to the Range Rover development vehicles of the late 60s.

The birthday celebrations also saw a 'HUE' birthday cake flown in by special delivery in a Lynx helicopter by a member of the 'Black Cats' Royal Navy display team.

Mr Crathorne, pictured with the oldest Land Rover, known as Huey, has worked on every car.

He added: 'I've worked on the Defender, Freelander, Discovery, Range Rover, Range Rover Sport and Range Rover Evoque.

'I started as an engineer and would work closely with the designers. I then presented the cars at motor shows, taught people how to drive them and now I work in communications.

'Teaching people how to drive the cars off road was brilliant and was my favourite role at the company. It was known as the Land Rover Experience and there was an off-road track just around the corner in Solihull.'

Mr Crathorne currently drives two Land Rovers, but has owned 20 during his time at the company.

He continued: 'At the moment I am driving a Freelander II and I also have a 1951 Series 1 Land Rover, that I cherish.

John Edwards, Land Rover's Global Brand Director, was delighted to celebrate this milestone.

He said: 'Land Rover is celebrating 65 years of proud heritage. It is in fact a dual celebration, as March saw Land Rover deliver the strongest ever monthly and quarterly sales performance in its history.

'Since 1948, every component in our vehicles has been designed and engineered with intent and Land Rover continues to this day, to build the world's most capable all-purpose vehicles.

'Investing in innovation has always been the lifeblood of Land Rover and we will continue to develop innovative new technology and sustainable motoring solutions for the future.'
