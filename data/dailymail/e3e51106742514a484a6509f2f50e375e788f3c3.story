A sky-high pile of clean laundry might seem an ominous task.

But master this trick and it could be taken care of in seconds - literally. An incredible tutorial, posted on YouTube, shows how to fold a t-shirt or short-sleeved shirt in less than two seconds.

Dave Hax, a self-styled 'How To' expert, demonstrates his masterful technique in a step-by-step guide which has already been viewed more than 2.5million times on the video-sharing website.

Lightning speed: The online tutorial demonstrates how to fold a t-shirt or short-sleeved shirt in less than two seconds 

Quick-fire: With ninja-like speed the shirt its flipped around and arranged neatly on the table

Tee minus two seconds: The technique requires pinching two points of the shirt before flipping it over

To begin, lie the shirt out on a table and then draw an imaginary line half-way down the shirt and another half-way between the outside edge and the centre section.

Pinch the point where the lines cross with your left hand, and the top of the shirt with your right hand.

Cross your right hand from the top to the bottom then quickly unfold your arms.

You can then use the table to fold the shirt back on itself.

'With a bit of practice, it can be done very quickly,' claims Dave Hax.

Mr Hax has posted a number of other 'How To' and craft videos on his account including how to make a Coca-Cola truck from old cans and how to make a vase from a light bulb.
