A footballer's wife has defended her decision to post an image of her flat stomach four days after she gave birth.

Caroline Berg Eriksen - who is married to Norwegian Premier League player Lars-Kristian 
Eriksen - was criticised for putting pressure on other new mothers to lose weight with the photograph.

Bloggers have said that to get the washboard waist in such a short space of time was physically impossible, but the 26-year-old has said she did not intend on upsetting anyone with the selfie.

Selfie: WAG Caroline Berg Eriksen posted this image of her flat stomach on Instagram, four days after she gave birth

New mother: Caroline Berg Eriksen, pictured with her baby daughter this week, has provoked outrage among the blogging community with the post

The photograph, which was posted on Instagram, shows her standing in front of a mirror in black and pink lace underwear.

Underneath, there a caption that reads 'I feel so empty and still not, 4 days after birth'.

Mrs
 Berg Eriksen, who runs the most visited blog in Scandinavia under the 
name Fotballfrue, or 'The Footballer's Wife', prompted one 
blogger to criticise the move as 'wildly provocative.' 

Writer Suzanne Aabel said she couldn't be sure if Mrs Berg Eriksen even 'belonged to the same species'.  She said: 'In my eyes, 
this picture is wildly provocative.'

Commenting
 on the post, one writer Heidi said: 'Is it really necessary to post a 
halfnaked picture of themselves?! It's just to show off, thinking's not
 much on how that image can affect readers.'

Commenting on the photo on Instagram, one user laurajanewilkes said, 'Can she look like this 4 days after???'

Pregnancy: The blogger, who is married to footballer Lars-Kristian Eriksen, is well known in Norway as a health and fitness writer

The amount of traffic to her website has doubled since the scandal to two million visitors as the semi-nude image spread online.

Mrs Berg Eriksen, who lives in a rural Norwegian town with her husband who plays for Odd Grenland and daughter, told Good Morning America: ‘I
 think that all women should be proud of themselves, regardless of how 
they look after labour.

‘During the pregnancy people kept telling me that my body would never would be the same.

‘I wanted to tell everybody that that is not entirely true. Right after birth, like three minutes after, I felt like myself again.’

Mrs Berg Eriksen has previously replied to her 
critics on Facebook, saying: 'I let out the picture because I'm proud of
 myself and my body for something as tough as a pregnancy / birth, and I
 think all mothers, regardless of the body shall be.'

The blogger was also backed by Gro Nylander, head of the women's clinic at the Norwegian National Hospital.

According to the Local, she said: 'I don't think we should bully The Footballer's Wife.

'Life is unfair, some people have flat stomachs while others have pouts.'

The doctor added that new mothers must understand that every body responds differently to pregnancy and that is was not productive to compare to other women.

'The most imporant thing is to be kind to your body. It's a positive thing to have a few extra kilos on your body after birth,' she said.

Mrs Berg Eriksen studied journalism at the Norwegian School of Creative Studies before becoming a fitness and health blogger, writing about her six-day-a-week workout programme and following the  LCHF (low carb-high fat) diet.
