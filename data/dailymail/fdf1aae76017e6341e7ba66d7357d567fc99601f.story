Most toddlers are very good at belly aching for sweets and dragging their feet on a supermarket trip.

Michael McBride, however, is more of a help than a hindrance to his mother – making sure she gets the right change at the checkout.

The three-year-old spends his time calculating the cost of groceries as he marches around the aisles adding up the weekly food basket.

Michael McBride is just three years old and can already count to 10 in four languages, including Russian and Japanese and do his 14 times table. He has an IQ of 145 - just a few points off the level required for Mensa 

Michael's mother Emma Greenwood (right) said they started to realise his intellectual skills when he began learning words and numbers from her iPad when he was just 18 months old, now he calculates her bills 

Not that his talents stop there. While most children of his age can only count to five, he has taught himself how to count to ten in four languages – English, Spanish, Russian and Japanese – and learnt his 14 times table.

In fact he has an IQ of 145 and is already close to qualifying for Mensa.

Tests found he had a reading and spelling age of eight and one expert was amazed at how he could converse like an adult. 

Michael has never had any formal tutoring and instead started to teach himself numbers and words on his mother’s iPad.

He quickly learnt how to read eight-letter words and now corrects mother Emma, 39, if she misreads his bedtime story book. 

Yet his family say he also loves riding his bike and splashing in puddles like any other young boy.

Mother-of-two Emma, a postal worker from Yate, Bristol, said: ‘We don’t push him because we are content to let him be himself – but he just teaches himself.

Michael can read to himself and experts said his scores for logical thinking 'hit the ceiling' when tested 

‘He is quite fascinated by numbers, and also loves big words.

‘His English is very good, but he is like a sponge and his retention is brilliant.’

Emma and husband Anthony, 33, a chef, first noticed Michael’s talent when he was 18 months old and started to learn from educational games on the iPad. 

But soon he was asking questions his family couldn’t answer.

Michael’s grandmother Jenny Greenwood took him to a specialist in Birmingham and tests found he had a reading and spelling age of eight – and an IQ of 145. 

The UK average is 104. She said: ‘In the last few weeks he has been obsessed with the planets, learning all the names and where they are.’ 

Michael’s parents have not submitted him for Mensa membership because they feel he is too young, although the youngest-ever member was just two years and four months-old. 

Membership of the society is reserved for those with an IQ in the top 2 per cent of the population, around 148.

IQ can change over time but most will not change by more than a few points. 

The score will usually stay the same as it is a measure of ability rather than knowledge. 

Dr Peter Congdon, who performed intelligence tests on Michael, said he was ‘in the very superior range’ and should jump a year at school so he is not held back.

He said: ‘He is outstanding, there is no doubt about it.’

The three-year-old can spell eight word letters on his own, spelling words he has never seen come across 

As well as doing his times tables and learning several languages, Michael likes doing 'normal' things for his age like splashing in puddles. The youngster (pictured) has taught himself by using his mother's iPad

Mensa was founded in England in 1946 by Roland Berrill, a barrister, and Dr Lance Ware, a scientist and lawyer.

The society welcomes people from all backgrounds who have an IQ is in the top two per cent of the population.

Albert Einstein apparently had an IQ of 160, while former US presidents Abraham Lincoln, Benjamin Franklin and Bill Clinton also racked up very high IQs - mustering 128, 160 and 137 respectively.

Napoleon Bonaparte scored 145 and Sigmund Freud had a score of 156.

There are currently more than 1,000 members of Mensa aged under 18.

Children under the age of 10-and-a-half can join Mensa by submitting prior evidence of their IQ score being in the top two per cent.

Adults and children over the age of 10-and-a-half, take the Mensa Supervised IQ Test.

The youngest person to ever join British Mensa was Elise Tan Roberts in 2009 aged 2 years and four months.
