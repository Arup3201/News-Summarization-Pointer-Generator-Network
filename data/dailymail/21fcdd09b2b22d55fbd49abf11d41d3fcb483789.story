Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from the Football League.

1) Gareth Barry has his own way of answering the group of Aston Villa fans who have booed him since he left in 2009.

Everton’s 3-0 success at Goodison on Saturday took his record against the club where he made 441 appearances in nearly 12 years to seven wins from nine Premier League matches – with a goal difference of 19-4.

The 33-year-old rubbed it in with yet another man-of-the-match display, covering more miles than any player on the pitch and finding a team mate with 81 of his 86 passes.

2) It’s not a coincidence that Joe Hart has saved three of the last five penalties he’s faced – the Manchester City goalkeeper does his homework.

Roberto Soldado had put four of his last five successful penalties to the goalkeeper’s bottom right hand corner – exactly where England No 1 Hart dived to keep out the Tottenham striker’s effort on Saturday.

3) Harry Redknapp has always prided himself on passing football but his current QPR side are even struggling on that score.

For all the problems they caused Liverpool their accuracy rate of just 68.8 per cent was the lowest of any Premier League team all weekend.

Maybe that’s why they are struggling so badly to score – five of their six Premier League goals this season have now come from set-pieces.

4) Mohamed Diame has four goals in five games for Hull now – as many as he scored in 41 appearances for West Ham in the whole of last season.

But it’s not just putting the ball in the net where he looks a different player. Against Arsenal he was a huge influence in midfield, winning nine tackles and involved in 22 duels for the ball – more than any other Premier League player all weekend.

5) Slightly built Tottenham youngster Tom Carroll, tiny in Premier League terms at just 5ft 9in, could have picked an easier place than Stoke to make his Premier League debut for Swansea after joining them on loan for the season.

But the 22-year-old rose well to the challenge, giving the ball away only five times during his 65 minutes. The 5.4 miles he ran was a fraction further than striker Wilfried Bony managed in 90.

Boss Garry Monk likens him to former Swans midfielder Joe Allen, and the way he stood up to 6ft 4in opponent Steven Nzonzi shows promise for the future.

6) Steven Taylor is refusing to give up on staying at Newcastle – even though the club tried to sell him in the summer and his contract runs out in seven months time.

The 29-year-old defender, picked for the first time since a 0-0 draw at Aston Villa in August, played a huge role in keeping Leicester to only three attempts at goal.

In four appearances including Capital One Cup ties this season, passionate Geordie Taylor has finished on the winning side three times.

7) New Huddersfield manager Chris Powell’s biggest problem in the next week could be persuading Wigan to extend the month’s loan of Grant Holt, which is due to run out.

Powell had taken one point from three games before Holt turned up, now the 4-2 win over Blackpool means he’s got 10 from the four matches in which the 33-year-old has played.

Meanwhile, Wigan boss Uwe Rosler, who hadn’t picked Holt for a Championship game all season, has not won a single match of four with his team scoring only two goals.

8) Felix Magath’s team selection during his time at Fulham was constantly bizarre – the German never named an unchanged side in his 20 games in charge and fans started playing ‘Felix bingo’ trying to guess the next line-up.

That’s all changed since Kit Symons has taken over – bringing Sean Kavanagh into his defence in place of the injured Fernando Amorebieta was only the fourth change he’s made in six games as caretaker.

Small wonder that Symons, the popular choice to stay in charge at Craven Cottage, has overseen four wins in that time.

9) John Gregory signed 11 new players for Crawley in the summer and has got another four on loan – but the wholesale changes are taking time to have an effect.

A 5-3 thrashing at Notts County meant the former Aston Villa and QPR boss, who hadn’t managed in England for six years before he took over the League One club, has seen his side ship nine goals in two games.

Gregory called it ‘embarrassing’ and admitted his players got bullied. Crawley are 15th in the table – exactly where they were when he took over last December.

10) Phil Brown must have looked with envy at how Ronald Koeman followed up collecting a manager of the month award.

While Southampton boss Koeman celebrated the honour by watching his side spank Sunderland 8-0, Brown has seen his Southend side crash since he won the League Two prize for four wins out of five in September.

Since then the Shrimpers have struggled – the 1-1 draw at Exeter was their first point in three games and there’s a tough trip to Newport to come on Tuesday night.
