Peering into the mirror, I carefully apply a thick layer of a fetching coral pink lipstick. But I can’t help but feel I look slightly like a small child who’s got hold of her mother’s make-up bag.

That’s because I’m not wearing it on my lips, but have smeared it around my eyes. I’m trying the latest internet beauty tip, which suggests that, when it comes to dark circles around the eyes, lipstick could be the secret weapon we’ve all been looking for.

Last week, websites and forums were buzzing with the news after a beauty blogger revealed her unconventional approach in a video posted on YouTube.

BEFORE: Claire Coleman (pictured) has spent years searching for the perfect concealer to hide her dark circles 

She advocated using an orangey-red lipstick, applied with a brush, all around the eye area, before applying your regular concealer, insisting that it gave a better result than concealer alone.

In the video, Deepica Mutyala starts her make-up routine by taking an eye-shadow brush, dabbing it on the lipstick and then tapping the colour around her eye wherever she has dark circles or blemishes.

She blends it with the brush until she has two raccoon-style orange circles around her eyes and then continues with the rest of her make-up, using a sponge to apply concealer over the top of the lipstick.

The result is impressive and, as celebrity make-up artist Oonagh Connor explains, while it might sound — and look — peculiar, it makes perfect sense.

‘Dark circles around the eyes tend to be blue or purple in tone,’ Oonagh says. ‘When you look at a colour wheel [a visual representation of all the colours of the rainbow, arranged according to how they relate to each other], those shades sit directly opposite the corally oranges, which means that the lipstick should help neutralise the darkness.’

She adds: ‘It’s similar to the way in which people with very red tones in their skin are advised to use a green colour-correcting cream to cancel out the redness, because green and red are opposite each other on the colour wheel.’

DURING: Claire (pictured) bravely opted to try out the new beauty craze sweeping the internet which involves using lipstick to cover up under eye dark circles 

Like many people, I seem to be permanently cursed with dark circles around my eyes, irrespective of how much sleep I’ve had.

Dark circles happen for a number of reasons. Because the skin around the eye area is thinner than elsewhere, the blood vessels beneath the surface are more apparent, giving a darker appearance — and while sleep, a healthy diet and avoiding cigarettes and alcohol can help alleviate the problem, some people, like me, are genetically predisposed to looking like pandas.

So, if you can’t get rid of them, you have to cover them up. Over the years, I’ve tried almost every concealer going.

Everyone swears by the reflective powers of YSL’s Touche Eclat (£25), but the texture is light and I felt I needed heavier coverage — and while its light-reflecting properties work well in real life, if you’re photographed with a flash, because of the way it bounces back light you can look like you have white stripes under your eyes.

Then there was Estee Lauder’s Double Wear Maximum Cover (£29.50), which definitely did cover, but felt a bit cakey, with a tendency to sit in creases. Currently, I’m using Benefit’s Boi-ing (£17.50) which isn’t bad, but has a tendency to dull my skin. Which was why, when I heard about this new approach, I was intrigued enough to give it a go. Although the video suggests using a deep orange-red lipstick, Oonagh recommends I try something a little less dramatic.

‘Deepika’s got a darker skin tone than you, so I think that the shade she’s used will be too dark. I’d recommend something that still has those orange tones, but is more coral than fiery orange.’

I decide to try Estee Lauder’s Hydra Lustre Lipstick in Portofino Coral. It’s sheer — anything sparkly wouldn’t work — but has a good amount of pigment. Because I’m putting on more make-up than usual, Oonagh advises that I use an eye cream first to keep the area well hydrated to avoid the end result looking caked on.

Rather than messing around with a brush — who has the time? — I decide to simply scrawl it directly on to my face, under the eyes and into the eye socket, where I also have dark marks, before smudging it slightly with my ring finger.

Although I feel a bit stupid, the feel of the lipstick on my skin isn’t that strange. Because it’s a sheer lipstick, it goes on easily, doesn’t drag the skin when I smudge it, and doesn’t feel like it’s too heavy.

AFTER: Claire (pictured) was impressed by the results but did not like the fact that she felt like she was caked in make-up 

I’m still not convinced it is going to work, but I let it sit for a minute as many cosmetics need a bit of time to ‘set’, and then, as per instructions, begin to apply my regular concealer over the top.

‘Use your finger or a sponge to press the concealer on top of the lipstick,’ says Oonagh. ‘If you use a sponge with a pointed tip, you can get right into the corner of the eye and up to the lash line. But press, don’t rub, or you’ll mix it all together and end up with a pink mess.’

Gradually, I build up the coverage of my concealer over the top of the lipstick and, to my surprise, it looks like it’s working. When I’ve finished, the dark circles are gone — as has the coral lipstick.

But whereas my concealer often looks chalky, the combination of the pinky-orange tones, and the glossy formulation of the lipstick underneath, means that the end result is warmer, more radiant and more natural.

On the downside, I do feel like I’m caked in make-up and I can’t help feeling that using a better concealer — or even blending a touch of lipstick into my concealer before applying it — might be a better, and more lightweight, solution. This is especially the case as the day goes on, and the heavy make-up begins to settle into the fine lines under my eyes, leaving creases.

It’s not something that I’d do every day, but for an early morning meeting when I’m feeling bleary eyed, it’s a useful trick to have up my sleeve.

For now, though, my search for the ultimate concealer continues.
