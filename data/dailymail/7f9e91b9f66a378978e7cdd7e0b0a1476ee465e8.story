Cyril Neame's (pictured) distraught family have moved the 83-year-old from his care home after he was bitten by a rat while he slept

A  war veteran with dementia has been moved from his care home after being bitten by a rat while he slept.

Cyril Neame's family accused staff at Haydon Mayer care home of failing to promptly tell them about the attack which left him with bite marks, bruising and recurring nightmares.

The 83-year-old was taken to hospital and given a tetanus jab after being bitten on his right hand but staff at the council-run home didn't tell his wife for another two days.

When the dementia sufferer was returned to hospital five weeks later for a bad case of cellulitis - a skin infection - the local authority decided to investigate.

They cleared the care home of any wrongdoing but Mr Neame was too scared to return and has now been removed by his family.

His wife Mavis, 79, said: 'It was such a shock because it's such an unusual thing to happen. It was very upsetting.

'It didn't seem real and it's only afterwards you realise how bad it is.

'He was very worried about going back to the care home because he was worried that if he complained he wouldn't get good treatment.

'It's one of those things, it's so rare and unfortunate.'

Daughter-in-law Natasha Ann Neame said staff told them the rat must have entered through an open window because it was raining outside the home in Herne Bay, Kent. 

The pensioner was left with puncture marks and bruising on his arms after being bitten by the rodent and had to be given a tetanus jab by care home staff

Mr Neame was attacked last October at the council-run facility in Herne Bay, Kent but his family say they were not told about the incident until he was taken to hospital with cellulitis and doctors discovered the bite mark

She also questioned the decision not to inform them immediately of the attack last October.

Natasha, 26, said Mr. Neame, who fought with the Gloucester Regiment in the Korean War, was tormented by nightmares of the incident.

She added: 'He said it was a big rat and that it had climbed up onto his bed and it was on his abdomen.

'He didn't realise what it was and when he brushed it off it bit him on the hand and he called for help.

'At first he was joking about the whole thing but then he started having nightmares about the incident.

'He said he feared the rats were going to get him when he was in hospital.

'They should have called us immediately rather then wait so they could talk to us face to face as he was really distressed.

'His care in general was just not good enough and the doctors couldn't believe his cellulitis had been allowed to get that bad.

'We are angry about it but he is safe now and that is what matters.'

Kent County Council launched an investigation after the retired postman's admission to hospital but have now cleared staff of any blame.

A spokesman said: 'Our investigation found that the staff had acted professionally and appropriately to safeguard residents.

'Mr Neame was later admitted to hospital with a condition unrelated to the rat bite and then decided he no longer wanted to remain at Haydon Mayer.

'Mr Neame's case manager supported him to move to another nursing home after leaving hospital and we understand he has settled in well.'

The most recent CQC inspection of the care home found no problems with the quality of care provided.

Mr Neame has now been moved to the High Meadows home in Canterbury.
