Google has been forced to urgently change its predictive search function after The Mail on Sunday revealed that the internet giant was directing users to a sickening video of a man beheading a woman and articles about a vile clip of a man sexually abusing a child.

Unsuspecting users simply typing ‘Facebook video of’ were just one click away from the horrendous material. Google’s auto-search function works by predicting what users are going to type in, based on the most popular internet searches.

Because of this, last week users who made similar searches – many of whom could be schoolchildren – were given a selection of options, including a 57-second video appearing to show a young Mexican woman, her hands tied behind her back and on her knees, being beheaded by a masked man in broad daylight.

Shocking: The horrific links that came up on a simple Google search

The clip – first circulated on Facebook before the social media company removed it last month – now appears on a website called bestgore.com, which is adorned with sexually explicit adverts.

Another suggested search directed users to a series of articles about a sick video of a man abusing a child which was viewed on Facebook tens of thousands of times in March before being removed.

Scary: It's incredible, and worrying, how close surfers can get to the likes of this, a video of a woman being beheaded

When we alerted Google on Friday afternoon, it took drastic action and altered its auto-search function so that the terms no longer appeared, although users can still search for them if they type them in.

Google said it had a ‘zero-tolerance’ policy against explicit content on its auto-search function and took action within 12 hours.

Last night the Government said it would seek an urgent explanation from Google this week over the matter.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller said: ‘This kind of online content is horrific, and the fact it can be accessed easily is completely unacceptable.

‘For too long, it been too easy for big companies to turn a blind eye to their responsibilities. They enable access to this harmful material, and after last week’s Government summit, they know they must take action.

'We will continue to put unrelenting pressure on internet companies until they act to tackle this issue properly.’

Dr John Bird, operations manager at the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said: ‘It’s absolutely shocking and very dangerous.

‘Google has a responsibility of care and to be actively helping people search for this kind of stuff is both disgusting and irresponsible. It’s an insult to people like me who have been abused in their childhood years and had pictures taken of them.

Anyone, even a child, could be innocently typing those words in on a Google search and be confronted with all of that.’

A man jailed after downloading hundreds 
of indecent images of children has had his lifetime ban on using the 
internet overturned – after claiming the punishment was unfair.

Gordon 
Amos, 34, was handed the ban last year and imprisoned for 18 months 
after he was caught with 440 indecent images of children.

But judges at 
London’s Court of Appeal lifted the ban after the married father of one 
said he could not turn his life around without being allowed on the 
internet.

Mumsnet founder Justine Roberts added: ‘This illustrates how easy it is to stumble across perfectly legal pornographic content that is not age-appropriate – Google even signposts it.

Unfortunately, as things stand, technology doesn’t seem capable of offering a silver bullet, so it’s very important for parents to keep the lines of communication open with their children and to offer an alternative view of sexual relationships to the standard pornographic fare.’

Google has come under fire recently after refusing to install automatic filters that would force users to ‘opt in’ to online pornography.

However, this month it donated £1 million to the Internet Watch Foundation, a charity that polices images of child abuse and can get them removed.

And last week Google, along with BT, TalkTalk and Facebook, pledged an additional £1 million over four years to the foundation.

A Google spokesman said: ‘Search queries that you see as part of autocomplete are a reflection of what people are searching for on Google, which often include widely read news headlines like this story that was reported in the Daily Mail and elsewhere.’
