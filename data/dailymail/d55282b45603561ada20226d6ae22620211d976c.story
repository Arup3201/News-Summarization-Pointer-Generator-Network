In his choice of vice- captains, Paul McGinley has avoided the charge levelled at Tom Watson that the American management team has a hint of ‘Dad’s Army’ about it.

If there is any concern about the European captain’s five wise men it is due to the sheer number of them. There will certainly be any number of opinions for him to draw on, with a broad range of experience, including two men who have won matches themselves in his role.

McGinley has explained that he liked the way having five vice- captains worked at Celtic Manor and the extra demands that come with being in charge of the home side require additional support

Tom Watson and Team USA's vice captains are Andy North, Raymond Floyd and Steve Stricker

They will be used in a variety of ways: as his eyes and ears out on the course, a source of wise counsel, as morale-boosters and motivators, and taking charge of certain groups of players — in the build-up and during the three days of the event itself. McGinley believes these are people in whom he can place absolute trust.

Miguel Angel Jimenez

Beneath his carefree and cigar-chomping exterior the Spaniard is reckoned to have an astute analytical golfing brain. He already has leadership experience, having captained Europe in the much lower profile EurAsia Cup. Completely tuned in with the players, he is likely to be casting his eye over Thomas Bjorn and Victor Dubuisson, among others.

Des Smyth

The 61-year-old Irishman has the lowest profile of the quintet. He still plays on the Veterans’ Tour and, like many of his compatriots, was a renowned expert at mastering wet and windy conditions. When McGinley came on to the circuit as a player Smyth served almost as a father figure and mentor to him. He will be a reassuring sounding board for the captain.

Sam Torrance

Few men are more synonymous with the Ryder Cup than the gravel-voiced Scot, who made eight appearances as a player and was then a winning captain in 2002. Closely linked with McGinley, partly through his late father Bob who coached the Irishman, there is no aspect of the competition he has not experienced one way or the other. This competition’s ultimate wise old bird.

Padraig Harrington

McGinley goes back so far with the major winner that they were actually at school together and served a joint apprenticeship playing alongside each other in amateur competitions. Like Jimenez, the one-time aspiring accountant has an analytical mind and is plugged into the tour. He has a kinship with McDowell and McIlroy.

Jose Maria Olazabal

The man who presided over the Miracle of Medinah is sufficiently ego-free to slot in comfortably as a deputy. Emotional and an excellent speaker in the team room, he will be one to inject some real feeling in there if needed. Medinah gives him natural authority, although McGinley will hope that he did not use up all his Ryder Cup luck last time out.
