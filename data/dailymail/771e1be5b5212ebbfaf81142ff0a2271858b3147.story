Trainer Jonjo O’Neill led the tributes to Dessie Hughes, who has died aged of 71.

O’Neill rode Sea Pigeon when runner-up to the Hughes-ridden Monksfield in the 1979 Champion Hurdle.

O’Neill said: ‘He was a lovely straightforward and helpful man and we had some great tussles. The only bad bit about him was that he was a hard man to beat in a finish.’

Hughes, whose son Richard last week won his third champion jockeys’ title, was one of the few men in racing who could claim to have an equal success as a jockey as well as a trainer.

His eight Cheltenham Festival winners as a jockey also included the 1977 Gold Cup on Davy Lad, part of a fruitful partnership with trainer Mick O’Toole.

After he switched to training, Hughes managed six Festival winners, most notably Hardy Eustace, successful in the 2003 Neptune Investement Novices’ Hurdle before landing the 2004 and 2005 Champion Hurdle.

As well as being a top trainer Hughes will be remembered for his talents as a jockey, winning eight races

Conor O’Dwyer, who rode Hardy Eustace, said: ‘I've ridden for many good people during my career, but Dessie really stood out as a proper gentleman.

‘No one ever had a bad word to say about Dessie, and Dessie never had a bad word to say about anyone.’
