Ashley Cole believes people are desperate for him to fail in his quest for a World Cup spot.

The Chelsea star's England place is under severe threat from first-choice starter Leighton Baines and Southampton wonderkid Luke Shaw.

Cole has enjoyed a return to the Chelsea line-up in crunch games against Atletico Madrid and Liverpool after spending much of the season displaced at left back by the right-footed Cesar Azpilicueta.

And with a fight on his hands for his place for club and country, Cole, 33, says he not only has to contend with Baines and Shaw but the weight of public opinion.

'There was probably a lot of pressure on me to fight for my England spot,' Cole told beIn SPORTS.

'Maybe not just my starting spot even - just to get on the plane. I think everyone wanted me to fail, to be honest.

'I think real football fans understand what I bring to a team and what I give to a team and if I do make it on the plane hopefully people can see that.

'But ultimately most people wanted me to fail in Madrid last week, for sure.

'Maybe people have seen me play for 13 years for my country and have probably had enough of it.

'You
 look at the players and you have Baines who is playing brilliantly and 
young Luke Shaw who has done amazing this season so I don’t blame them, 
they’ve got reasons to, but like I said in my Nike ad - I’m not done 
yet.'
