Out of a job: Paris Brown, Britain's first youth police and crime commissioner, was forced to stand down from her £15,000-a-year-role over her online activity

A £26,000 youth 'ambassador' is to be appointed by Cheshire Police - just weeks after Britain's first youth crime tsar was sacked over a series of allegedly racist, violent and homophobic messages.

The job pays £10,000 more than the salary given to Paris Brown, 17, who lost her job in Kent after her Twitter posts were made public.  

Cheshire's decision to create a similar post for a candidate aged between 18 and 21 has raised questions about their use of public money.

But John Dwyer, Cheshire's police and crime commissioner, still wants to hire a young person to 'act as a conduit between young people and the police'.

The successful candidate would ideally have  A-Levels, but this is not essential, and the job pays between £23,799 and £25,449.

New teachers get around £21,588 and the average salary in the UK is £26,500.

Paris Brown, 17, was appointed to the
£15,000-a-year role to help Kent Police 'stay in touch with young 
people' by providing their views on policing, but she was forced to step down.

The teenager 
was questioned over the posts by officers from Kent Police's Special 
Branch, but the force said last week it would take 'no further action' after
concluding the case 'does not pass the evidential threshold for 
prosecution'.

In tweets posted on her personal 
account before she was appointed youth crime commissioner, Miss Brown 
called homosexuals 'fags', immigrants 'illegals' and travellers 
'pikeys', and said she had 'a thing for older men'.

In another tweet she wrote: 'I really wanna make a batch of hash brownies.'

Miss Brown also posted: 'Everyone on Made In Chelsea looks like a f****** fag', in reference to the Channel 4 reality show.

Post: Paris Brown's job was seen as a way of connecting Kent Police with young people but her Twitter account was not looked at before her appointment

Remorse: The 17-year-old, who denies being racist or homophobic, has apologised for any offence caused by the messages posted online

The Twitter account, which has since been deleted, was not checked as part of the recruitment process.

Miss
Brown, from Sheerness in Kent has since apologised for causing offence 
with the messages she posted between the ages of 14 and 16.

Insistent: Cheshire's John Dwyer wants to appoint someone to act as a conduit between young people and the police, despite the Paris Brown scandal

She
denied being anti-gay or racist, and said she is against taking drugs, 
insisting that the reference on Twitter to making 'hash brownies' was 
from a Scooby Doo film.

The teenager's Twitter account was not checked as part of the recruitment process.

Announcing plans to create a similar role in Cheshire, John Dwyer insisted that it was an important post.

He said: 'My role as commissioner is to be the bridge between the public and the police, and it's important that our young people are not left out of that partnership.

'I want to appoint a Youth Ambassador, someone who has experience of working with young people to ensure they have a voice.

'The role will not only provide young people with a point of contact but they will also deliver key messages such as internet safety and the dangers of drugs and alcohol.'

The fixed-term post, whose salary was advertised as £23,800-£25,500, would run until May 2016.

Potential applicants have until May 3 to submit their details.

But critics say the decision 'does not bode well'.

Dave Cargill, a member of the county's Police and Crime Panel told the Times: 'It’s a strange thing that you can pay up to £25,000 for a very young person and yet they expect members of the crime panel to scrutinise [the PCC] without any allowance, the jury’s out at the moment.'

Police in Kent have received 26 applications to replace Miss Brown as Youth Commissioner.

The 17-year-old was appointed by Police and Crime Commissioner Ann Barnes last month.

Mrs Barnes said: ''I think Paris would have been a really good ambassador for us.

'She was interviewed by very experienced people and they all liked her, she was a very mature young lady.

'But she has learned from this and we can't keep on poking the singer. You have got to forgive.

'What she said was absolutely awful but she has repented for that.

'So I'm looking for somebody special. We have the 26 already and I am sure there is somebody out there for this job.'
