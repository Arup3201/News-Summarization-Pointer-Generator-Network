Soil microbes that thrive in the deserts, rainforests, prairies and forests of the world can also be found living beneath New York City's Central Park, researchers have discovered.

Scientists were stunned to find thousands of different microbes in samples they analysed - the majority being new to science.

Only 8.5 percent to 16.2 percent of the organisms discovered in the park soils, depending on their type, had been previously entered into existing databases that describe microbial life 

Scientists find one of the most diverse ecosystems on earth - in the soil of New York's Central Park. They analyzed 596 soil samples collected from across Central Park’s 843 acres

The types of plants and animals that are able to live in a particular biome, like the desert, are largely determined by the climate. 

But microbes appear to be more concerned about the environment in the soil, such as the acidity and the carbon availability, than how hot or dry the climate is. 

This allows diverse microbial communities to thrive wherever the soil conditions are equally diverse - such as in Central Park. 

'We found thousands of different organisms, and it was shocking how few had ever been described,' said Noah Fierer of CU-Boulder, who led the study.

'Not only do they not have a name, but we don't know anything about them. 

'We don't know what sort of conditions they like to live under or what role they may play in soil habitat and soil fertility.' 

The research team analyzed 596 soil samples collected from across Central Park’s 843 acres and discovered a stunning diversity of below-ground life, most of which had never been documented before. 

The team was surprised to find that the breadth of biodiversity beneath Central Park is similar to the biodiversity found across the world, from the frozen Artic tundra to hot deserts and nearly everything in between.

Only 8.5 percent to 16.2 percent of the organisms discovered in the park soils, depending on their type, had been previously entered into existing databases that describe microbial life, according to the study results published today in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

'If you want to find unique diversity and if you want to find a wide range of different below-ground organisms, you don't have to travel around the world,' said Fierer, who is also a fellow at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences. 

'You can walk across Central Park.'

The only area that did not have soil microbial communities that overlapped with the samples taken from Central Park was Antarctica, where Wall has done extensive research.

'No one would ever expect to find an overlap in the types of trees we see in Central Park and the type of trees we see in a tropical forest,' Fierer said. 

'But that doesn't seem to be true for the microbes living in the soil. We found all these community types just within Central Park. 

'Below-ground biodiversity doesn't follow the same rules as the plants and animals living above ground.'

'The soil microbes in Central Park benefit us, benefit soil health, and are linked tightly to the beauty of the trees and other plants we see,' said Professor Diana Wall.

The team was surprised to find that the breadth of biodiversity beneath Central Park is similar to the biodiversity found across the world, from the frozen Artic tundra to hot deserts and nearly everything in between.

'The nation's food, cities, clean air and water and economy are all dependent on healthy, fertile soils and that motivates us to understand this fascinating hidden life beneath our feet.'

The scientists also compared the below-ground biodiversity in Central Park to 52 soil samples taken from locations spanning the globe, from Alaska to Antarctica.
