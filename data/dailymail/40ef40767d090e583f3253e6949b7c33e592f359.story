Two young women charged with seriously assaulting an elderly, vision-impaired man on a Gold Coast bus will be sentenced in September. 

Layni Cameron, 17, and Larna Watmough, 21, have been charged with serious assault and public nuisance after footage emerged of them allegedly attacking Paul Buttigieg, 77, in February.

The footage appears to show the girls hitting and kicking the man, spitting at him and breaking his glasses.

Layni Cameron and Larna Watmough were captured on camera allegedly assaulting an elderly man on a bus

A solicitor told the court today that the two women intend to plead guilty to the charges of serious assault and public nuisance

At one point the video appears to show the man standing up and attempting to fight back but he is quickly pushed back to his seat.

It is believed the women had attended a racing event during the day before catching the bus home from the Tweed Heads Bowls Club.

A 13-year-old female passenger filmed the incident and the video was taken to the police, as well as posted to the Internet, where it went viral.

It is alleged that the incident was fuelled by racism, with the girl’s making racial comments about Mr Buttigieg, who is Aboriginal.

The footage also shows the girls verbally abusing a woman with a pram.

The women intend to plead guilty to the charges, solicitor Ashleigh Nicholls told the court today, and they will face sentencing in September.

Cameron also faces charges over the robbery of a convenience store in Surfers Paradise a few weeks before the alleged bus attack, the court heard today.
