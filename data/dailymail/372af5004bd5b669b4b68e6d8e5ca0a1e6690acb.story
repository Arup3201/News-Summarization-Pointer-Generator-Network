A fugitive bodybuilder charged with assaulting a teenage girl he met on Instagram while on the run from police over a separate offence has been cleared of rape. 

Lloyd Seddon was accused of attacking the 16-year-old after meeting her on the photosharing website in February, five months after vanishing while on parole for robbery.

The 23-year-old from Salford, Manchester, was found not guilty of raping the girl at his home at Manchester Crown Court today.  

Lloyd Seddon was cleared of raping a 16-year-old girl after being hunted by police for more than six months 

Police had been unable to find the man after he failed to show up for a court hearing in November following early release from a five-year prison sentence for armed robbery. 

In April Greater Manchester Police released photographs of the criminal after a teenage girl reported she had been raped by him. 

He was arrested at a flat in Shrewsbury in May and charged with the sexual assault. 

During his trial the court heard how Seddon exchanged messages with the teenage girl on Instagram before meeting up for their 'first date'. 

They met for cocktails on February 19 and took a taxi back to an address in Irwell where she alleged he pulled her hair and 'bit and slapped' her. 

She said she was saved after phoning a friend during the attack, a claim which was dismissed by Seddon's defence lawyers. 

The 23-year-old from Salford, Manchester, said the girl may have become scared of him when he showed a 'different side' after she changed her mind about having sex with him

Police issued an appeal for the man's whereabouts after the girl reported being raped in April. They urged members of the public to look out for Seddon who has a distinctive tattoo on his right forearm 

Today, barrister Michael Johnson told how the girl had in fact become 'embarrassed' by the encounter so falsely accused him of assaulting her. 

In response she retracted her accusation of rape, telling the court: 'No I didn't say I was raped, I explained to police what happened and said what is it classed as and they said that comes down as rape. 

'I never said I was raped.' 

Giving evidence Seddon said the sex had been consensual but when the girl changed her mind he stopped immediately but became verbally abusive.

'She probably just seen another side of me and she got scared.

'She’s a young girl. I shouldn't have taken her back to mine, I should never have taken her out in the first place,' he said. 

In just half-an-hour he was unanimously cleared of the charge by a jury.

Speaking after his conviction, the 23-year-old's family said: 'This unanimous decision is a triumph for British justice. It’s been terrible for the family. 

'We all knew he was not guilty.'

Earlier relatives complained at the way Seddon had been portrayed by police in their appeal to trace him. 

Speaking in April, his mother Cresta Dickinson pleaded for him to come forward to clear his name. 

'He has been called every name under the sun and it isn’t right. He is just a gym user and would go maybe a couple of times a week.

'He likes to look after himself but he is definitely not a cage fighter.'

A Greater Manchester Police appeal warned members of the public not to approach him. 

'Lloyd Seddon has a history of violence and is not to be approached. 

'However, Seddon is a fitness fanatic who takes part in cage-fighting and mixed martial arts and officers believe he will be unable to resist the temptation to visit the gym.'
