Boris Johnson last night urged David Cameron to bring forward plans for a referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU.

The London Mayor, one of the leading contenders to succeed the PM as Tory leader, said that a speedy decision would be positive for Britain and Europe.

Speaking on a tour of the US, Mr Johnson said: ‘Let’s get it done.’ The Prime Minister has announced plans to give voters their first say on Britain’s place in Europe since 1975 if the Conservatives remain in power.

Boris Johnson, pictured, advised David Cameron to fast-forward his planned EU referendum 

He has pledged to renegotiate looser ties with Brussels and then hold an in/out referendum by the end of 2017.

The commitment has become a key election battleground, since Labour has set its face against a referendum.

Downing Street has dismissed the idea that it has secretly been planning to bring the vote forward to next year if Mr Cameron remains in office.

However, during a G20 finance ministers summit in Turkey, Chancellor George Osborne hinted that the date might be brought forward. He said the Prime Minister would be ‘delighted’ if he could complete renegotiation of the UK’s EU membership earlier.

Mr Johnson said: ‘I very much welcome the idea of bringing forward the renegotiation and the referendum.

‘Let’s get it done. We should stress that this is something that can be very positive, not just for Britain but for the whole of Europe and indeed for investors in Europe because a reformed Europe will deliver growth and prosperity. Get it done, get the change, get it done, put it to the people.’

David Cameron warned business leaders yesterday that his planned EU referendum was required otherwise the UK would 'drift towards the exit' and the poll would be based on his renegotiation of the agreement

Mr Cameron yesterday warned that public scepticism about the EU meant that Britain would ‘drift towards the exit of the EU’ unless a referendum was held.

Addressing the annual conference of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) in London, the Prime Minister insisted that firms were backing his plan to hold a referendum after renegotiating the terms of Britain’s membership.

‘They are saying it is quite right to have a strategy that gives Britain the best chance of staying in a reformed European Union that works in our interest and that is what my approach is,’ he said.

‘Let’s get stuck in there, let’s hold a negotiation, let’s deal with those things that are holding Britain back, and then let’s have this put to the British public in an in/out referendum.’

A Downing Street source said: ‘We have always said we want a referendum by the end of 2017, and there is no secret plan to hold it next year. But both the Prime Minister and the Chancellor have said if they can do it sooner, that would be great. We want to get reform agreed, and there are serious negotiations and discussions to be had. There are 28 countries in the EU and we are not going to pretend that can happen overnight.’

However Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would never ‘flirt with exit’. He said reform of the EU was needed, but claimed a referendum would be ‘hugely destabilising to British business.’

He added: ‘I fear that Britain walking out of the EU is the biggest risk to our economy in the next decade.’
