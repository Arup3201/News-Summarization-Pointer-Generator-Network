A 14-year-old American citizen has been jailed for three years after telling authorities he beheaded four people whose bodies were hung from a bridge.

Edgar Jimenez Lugo, known as 'El Ponchis' (The Cloaked One), was given the maximum sentence allowed for a minor in Morelos, Mexico.

The U.S. teenager worked for the Beltran Leyva brothers' cartel and killed four people whose bodies were hung in Cuernavaca, authorities said.

A judge gave Lugo the maximum sentence for a minor for organised crime, homicide, kidnapping, and drug and weapons possession.

He was born in San Diego, California, and was arrested in December as he tried to board a plane in Cuernavaca to Tijuana with his sisters.

One of his sisters, aged 16, was also allegedly involved in the crime gang.

She apparently disposed of her brother's victims by dumping the bodies on streets and freeways, officials said.

A video shot by CNN in December showed the boy being interrogated by Mexican military authorities after his capture.

In the video, an interrogator asks: 
'How many have you killed,' as Jimenez responds, 'four'. The soldier 
then asks: 'How did you execute them?â€™

The
boy calmly adds: 'I slit their throats. I participated in four 
executions, but I did it drugged and under threat that if I didn't they 
would kill me.'

Jimenez and his siblings were living in a poor neighbourhood of Jiutepec, a working-class suburb of Cuernavaca, known as a weekend getaway for Mexico City residents.

The area has an industrial area with Nissan, Unilever and other factories and has rustic single-level concrete homes and some farms.

Many youths are used by drug cartels in their bloody battles against the government and each other, but the story of El Ponchis is shocking.

After he was captured, he said he was kidnapped aged 11 and forced to work for the Cartel of the South Pacific, a branch of the splintered Beltran Leyva gang, and that he had participated in at least four decapitations.

Mexican newspaper La Razon reported last month that El Ponchis was paid $3,000 for each murder he committed.
