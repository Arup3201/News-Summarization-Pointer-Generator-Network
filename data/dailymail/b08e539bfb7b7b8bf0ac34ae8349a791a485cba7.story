You might think that a chirpy pop song or up tempo tune is just the thing to cheer someone up.

But listening to sad but beautiful songs by the likes of Johnny Cash or Leonard Cohen really can help you beat the blues, scientists said.

They found that depressed or sad people prefer to listen to beautiful music that triggers important memories.

Heaven knows I'm miserable now: Psychologists have found that depressed or sad people prefer to listen to beautiful music buy artists like Radiohead (lead singer Thom Yorke is pictured) that triggers important memories rather than upbeat happy pop songs

Psychologists from the University of Kent
 investigated the moods of people listening to ‘self-identified sad 
music’ and asked them their reasons for picking the tracks.

While there were a number of reasons a depressed person might select a particular piece of music, the researchers found that sometimes they didn’t necessarily want to pick happy tracks to cheer themselves up.

The study, published in the Psychology of Music, found choosing music identified as ‘beautiful’ was the only way to stop people feeling glum.

Previous studies showed that people choose to listen to sad music when they feel down.

Two hundred and twenty people were asked to think of a sad event and psychologists looked at the music they listened to afterwards.

They found that people prefer to listen 
to beautiful music that triggers important memories and that convey a 
particular message.

Dr Annemieke van den Tol, a lecturer at the university said: ‘It was self-identified sad music, so it was music they chose themselves.

Many of the people surveyed selected the beautiful tracks mainly because they had a memory about it

‘Two common examples were Hurt by 
Johnny Cash and Hallelujah by Jeff Buckley - the Leonard Cohen cover. 
Some people also chose Muse and Radiohead.

‘There
 were some people who selected the music mainly because they had a 
memory about it. It was often a memory of a person or of an event.’

Dr van den Tol explained that they were usually memories related to loved ones or sadness

‘The sadness was often caused by love sickness or death. There were a lot of younger guys who had mentioned their dog dying too,’ she said.

The researchers found that people’s music choice is linked to the individual’s own expectations for listening to music and its effects on them.

Dr van den Tol  said: ‘The results showed that if an individual has intended to achieve mood enhancement through listening to sad music, this was in fact often achieved by first thinking about their situation or being distracted, rather than directly through listening to the music chosen.

‘Indeed, where respondents indicated they had chosen music with the intention of triggering memories, this had a negative impact on creating a better mood.’

She added: ‘The only selection strategy that was found to directly predict mood enhancement was where the music was perceived by the listener to have high aesthetic value.’

Scientists discovered last year that people going through a break-up are more likely to feel uplifted by listening to tear-jerking songs.

Previous studies found that those who were feeling down countered that with uplifting experiences - upbeat songs or comedies. However the most recent research discovered that people are likely to gravitate towards experiences that echo their mood.

According to Science Daily, music becomes a replacement that temporary fills the gap of a broken personal connection.

Researchers from KAIST Business School in South Korea, the University of California in Berkeley and the FGV School of Administration said: 'Emotional experiences of aesthetic products are important to our happiness and well-being.

'Music, movies, paintings, or novels that are compatible with our current mood and feelings, akin to an empathic friend, are more appreciated when we experience broken or failing relationships.'
