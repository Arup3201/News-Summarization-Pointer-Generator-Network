Nearly 100 female British soldiers have been sent home from Afghanistan after finding out they were pregnant.

Between January 2006 and December last year, 99 servicewomen on operations have been flown back to the UK under strict military rules that ban mothers-to-be from serving in a war zone.

According to figures released by the Ministry Of Defence, 16 women were removed from Afghanistan in 2013 due to pregnancy, while 18 were sent home in 2011.

The women were flown back on flights 
usually reserved for injured troops, meaning the true figure could be 
higher if other female soldiers came home via routine flights, according to The Sun.

Troops are repeatedly 
reminded by senior officers to check they are not pregnant before they fly to the front
 line, however, servicewomen are
 not forced to take a urine test before deploying because top brass 
consider it would be an ‘invasion of privacy’.

In September 2012 it was revealed that Lance
 Bombardier Lynette Pearce, then 28, gave birth to a son at the field 
hospital in Camp Bastion, four days after the base was attacked by the 
Taliban.

The Fijian-born junior
 non-commissioned officer in the Royal Artillery had a healthy boy five 
weeks prematurely, not knowing she was pregnant.

She shocked military chiefs when she became the first UK soldier to have a baby on the battlefield, naming the child Immanuel Izadore Pearce.

Speaking after the birth, Lance Bombardier Pearce's mother Sugar said her daughter met the baby’s father in the UK after joining the Army.

Women now make up ten per cent of Armed Forces personnel. They account for 14 per cent of the RAF, nine per cent of the Navy and eight per cent of the Army.

There are currently 8,340 women serving in the British Army, 3010 in the Royal Navy and 4,950 in the Royal Air Force.

In 1949, women were officially 
recognised as a permanent part of British Armed forces, but it was not 
until the 1991 Gulf War that women were first deployed in combat roles.

Women first became eligible to pilot 
Royal Air Force combat aircraft in 1989 and the following year, they were 
permitted to serve on Royal Navy warships.

Although they can serve on the front line, women are not permitted to perform roles where the 'primary duty is to close with and kill the enemy', meaning they can not join the Infantry, Household Cavalry, Royal Armoured Corps, Royal Marines Commandos, RAF Regiment, Special Air Service and Special Boat Service.

During deployment women serve as combat medics or engagement officers.

After the birth she and Immanuel, who weighed a healthy 5lb 8oz, were flown to the UK and treated at the John Radcliffe Hospital 
in Oxford.

And in February 2011 it was revealed how how Private Kayla Donnelly, then 21, served on the front line in 
Afghanistan’s Helmand Province while seven months pregnant. She had 
conceived before going to the war zone.

Pte Donnelly, from 
Penrith, Cumbria, who serves with 12 Logistic Support Regiment, put the 
changes to her body and weight gain down to high-calorie army rations 
and the stress of war. She only realised she was expecting two weeks 
after she returned home and gave birth to son Josh.

The figures were revealed following a request under the Freedom of Information Act.

'Pregnant women are not allowed to be deployed on operations,' an MOD spokesman told MailOnline.

'The small numbers of personnel who discover that they are pregnant on operations  are returned at the first convenient opportunity.

'The MOD does not encourage or condone sexual relationships in theatre; our personnel are expected to behave in accordance with the Armed Forces values and standards at all times.'

The women all discovered they were 
pregnant while in Afghanistan, although it is not known if any of the 
babies were conceived there.

Servicemen and women are warned that the Ministry of Defence does not approve of sexual relations between
 troops and that any inappropriate behaviour would breach standards 
guidelines.

Those caught having sex usually face a rebuke from 
their commanding officer or more serious disciplinary action, depending 
on the rank and position of those involved.

Servicemen and women get three weeks off before they deploy to 
Afghanistan and two weeks rest and recuperation during their tour of 
duty.

Deployments to 
Afghanistan usually last between six and seven months, although with 
combat operations set to end later this year some tours have been 
extended to nine months.

At
 least 102 servicewomen were sent home from Iraq after finding out they 
were pregnant, before British forces withdrew from the country in 2009.

Soldiers heading for Afghanistan 
undergo stringent medical checks to make sure they can cope with the 
rigours of combat – but not pregnancy tests.

Servicemen and women take part in pre-deployment training for about six months before they fly to the war zone.

It includes arduous physical tests, 
such as an eight-mile march carrying a 40lb backpack, press-ups, sit-ups
and a 1.5-mile run against the clock.

Then there are a number of routine 
medical examinations depending on their roles, including hearing, 
eyesight and dental checks, and tests of body mass index.

They also have blood pressure, heart 
rate and lung capacity monitored and recorded. ‘We need to know people 
are fit enough to leg it to a helicopter, for instance, if there is an 
attack,’ said a Ministry of Defence spokesman.

Personnel are also given any vaccinations they need to ward off tropical diseases and a course of anti-malaria tablets.

Female soldiers are asked whether they
are – or suspect they are – pregnant. This is routine so medical staff 
can ensure the inoculation does not damage an unborn baby.

If they answer ‘yes’, then they will 
not be allowed to deploy. But if the response is ‘no’, it serves to 
remind sexually active servicewomen that it might be wise to take a 
pregnancy test.

Pre-deployment guidelines and advice 
issued to every soldier make clear that women troops should not deploy 
if they are pregnant but at no time are women given a pregnancy test by 
the MoD.
