Kansas prosecutors have filed state-level murder charges Tuesday against the white supremacist accused in shootings that left three people dead at two Jewish community sites in suburban Kansas City.

Frazier Glenn Cross has been charged with one count of capital murder for the deaths of 14-year-old boy and his grandfather outside the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City. Cross also faces one count of first-degree, premeditated murder for the death of a woman who was gunned down while visiting her mother at a nearby retirement complex.

The capital murder charge carries the death penalty as possible punishment and Cross is being held on $10million bond.

Precautions: Frazier Glenn Cross chose to wear a quilted sleeveless vest rather than clothes during his Tuesday court appearance

Charged: Cross, 73, now faces three counts of murder and is expected to have hate crimes brought against him following the triple homicide on Sunday at two Jewish facilities near Kansas City

The 73-year-old Vietnam War veteran is scheduled to appear in court at 1.30pm Tuesday in Johnson County District Court.

Cross was arrested Sunday after shooting and killing three people at two different Jewish centers in Kansas City, Kansas.

Cross is from southwest Missouri who founded the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in his native North Carolina and later the White Patriot Party.

None of Sunday's victims were Jewish: 
Dr. William Lewis Corporon, 69, and his grandson Reat Griffin Underwood,
 14, were at the community center for a singing contest audition, while 
53-year-old Terri LaManno was visiting her mother at the retirement 
complex.

The Southern 
Poverty Law Center also monitors, to varying degrees, the activities of 
hundreds of known white supremacists and anti-Semites at any given time.

Federal authorities were 
well-aware of the racist war vet, as were the SPLC and the ADL, who 
sometimes was known as Frazier Glenn Miller. 

Familiar: Cross, seen during his arrest on Sunday and in the subsequent mugshot, was put in witness protection in 1987 in exchange for testimony on fellow KKK members

After a 1986 contempt-of-court conviction in North Carolina for operating a paramilitary camp, Cross went in hiding while free on bond and fled to Missouri.

There, federal agents found him and several other men in a rural mobile home stocked with hand grenades, automatic weapons and thousands of bullets.

Cross entered federal witness protection programs in 1987, according to The Wall Street Journal, and agreed to cooperate with authorities. It is not clear when the protection ended.

Indicted on weapons charges and accused of plotting robberies and the assassination of SPLC founder Morris Dees, Cross served three years in federal prison but avoided a longer sentence in exchange for testifying against more than a dozen other KKK leaders.

'We were aware he was affiliated with certain hate groups,' FBI special agent Michael Kaste said at a Monday press conference.

Federal prosecutors say there's enough evidence to warrant putting the case before a grand jury as a hate crime.

Moving the case from state to federal prosecutors would likely mean tougher punishments if Cross is convicted.

'The motivation behind these attacks was a hate crime... He was trying to hurt someone based on race or ethnicity,’ FBI agent Kaste said at a Monday press conference.

Before the shootings, Cross had been contemptuous of some of his like-minded allies' reliance on social media over violent confrontation.

'He felt it was easy to be a 'keyboard commando,' but that the only way activists will ever succeed is by going out on the streets,' said Devin Burghart, the vice president of the Institute for Research & Education on Human Rights.

History of violence: Authorities were aware of Frazier Glenn Cross (who also went by the name Glann Miller) since the early 1980s when he founded the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, seen here in 1984

Racist: In recent years, watchdog groups were aware of Cross, seen here in an undated photo, and viewed him as a possible threat but because he had stopped posting as often, they became less concerned

Burghart said his group made a presentation on white supremacists to the Jewish Community Center in August, a discussion that included a description of Cross as an example of dangerous anti-Semitic figures in the region.

It wasn't clear what, if any, steps were taken by the center to act on the information.

The timing of the attack is worth 
noting, as a group monitoring anti-Semitic attacks in the U.S. 
cautiously reported a sharp decline in such incidents less than two 
weeks before this weekend’s attack.

In
 a report April 1, the Anti-Defamation League noted a 19 per cent drop 
in anti-Semitic incidents last year compared to 2012, part of what the 
group called a 'decade-long downward slide' and one of its lowest 
tallies since it started keeping such records in 1979.
