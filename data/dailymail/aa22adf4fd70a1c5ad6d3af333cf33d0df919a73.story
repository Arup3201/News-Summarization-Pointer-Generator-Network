Following accusations of double standards, Sharon Osbourne has 'categorically' denied that either she or husband Ozzy have ordered take-out food from the Beverly Hills Hotel since she called on people to boycott the establishment.

Osbourne has been one of the most vocal public supporters of the on-going protest against the hotel after its owner, the Sultan of Brunei, introduced strict new Islamic criminal laws in the Southeast Asian state.

On Monday, the New York Post reported that staff at the iconic hotel had confirmed that the Osbourne household had secretly been ordering takeout from them, while Sharon was publicly calling on people to shun the resort.

All talk? Sharon Osbourne, one of the most vocal public supporters of the on-going boycott against the Beverly Hills Hotel, has been accused of double standards

'It is categorically false that Ozzy Osbourne and I have order take-out food from the Beverly Hills Hotel since we started our boycott,' wrote Sharon on Facebook.

'First off, I have been out of the country for the past two weeks, so there's not even the slightest possibility I could have placed a 'recent' order as stated by hotel staff.'

'For the record. I am continuing my boycott of The Dorchester Collection Hotels in opposition to the Sultan Of Brunei's implementation of Sharia Law. I would never back down from my beliefs, especially for a plate of food.'

Until recently, the hotel was one of the most popular with Hollywood actors and celebrities, but they’ve been shunning it in recent weeks as part of protests at the introduction of strict new Islamic criminal laws in Brunei.

The hotel, part of the Dorchester Collection, is owned by the Sultan, who six weeks ago passed the laws which call for the stoning to death of homosexuals and adulterers.

Osbourne joined a host of celebrities including Ellen DeGeneres, Jay Leno and Virgin boss Richard Branson, who’ve called for a boycott of the Sultan’s hotels as a protest at the archaic laws.

On an episode of The Talk last month, Osbourne said she wouldn’t be visiting the hotels until he sold up.

‘I will not frequent an establishment that is owned by a person who says they are going to stone gays. It is insane behavior!,' she said, before revealing that she had gay friends who worked in several of the Sultan’s hotels.

On Twitter and Facebook, Osbourne has also made very public statements calling for people to join her in the boycott.

However the New York Post is reporting that several sources have confirmed that the Osbourne household have made several orders in recent weeks all while the boycott has been going on.

‘Nobody can be seen going into the hotel, so Sharon and her staff have been ordering takeout food from the Beverly Hills Hotel’s Fountain Coffee Room, then sending an assistant to pick it up,' a source told the newspaper.

'Sharon’s home is around the corner. The hotel staff are shocked at the hypocrisy.'

A representative for Sharon Osbourne has denied the allegations, but admitted that staff at her home could have ordered from the supposedly shunned establishment.

‘Sharon is continuing her boycott of the
 Dorchester Collection hotels in opposition to the Sultan of Brunei’s 
implementation of Sharia law,' said the rep in a statement.

'Rumors that she had her assistant pick up food for her at the Beverly Hills Hotel are fabricated and a blatant attempt to discredit Sharon. Sharon stands by her values and beliefs and would never back down, especially just for a chopped salad.

‘Christopher Cowdray (CEO of the Dorchester Collection) came to meet with her at CBS Studios and begged her to stop the boycott and to continue to be a patron of their hotels, but she flatly refused.

'Sharon says this shows that the boycott is working and that they’re desperate. They’re just singling Sharon out because she has a daily talk-show platform.

'Just for the record, her assistant (Julie) has not set foot in the Beverly Hills Hotel in the six weeks since she started her boycott.’

Cowdray admitted last month that the hotel has missed out on over $1.5million in lost income due to cancelled events, but he insisted the company could ‘weather the storm’.
