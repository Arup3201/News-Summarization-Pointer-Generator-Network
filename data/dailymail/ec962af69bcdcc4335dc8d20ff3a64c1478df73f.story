Ryan Giggs has insisted he is having no regrets over calling time on his illustrious playing career as he settles into his new role as assistant manager at Manchester United.

After 24 years playing the game Giggs decided it was time to hang up his boots in May, and despite missing elements of being a player he is relishing his role as Louis van Gaal's right-hand man.

He told MUTV: 'It was a great opportunity for me and I am loving it. It has been different. The manager works in different ways than I have maybe seen before.

Dream team: Giggs is really enjoying working alongside Van Gaal at Manchester United

Experienced: Giggs will be working closely with the likes of Wayne Rooney this season

Legend: Giggs had a fabulous 24-year spell as a player with United

'Obviously a coaches' work is done before training, after training and during training as well so it is different from being a player when you are just focused on training and that is when you do your stuff.

'It has been good. I have been analysing games, presenting to the [players] and it has been a good learning experience. 

'A lot of the courses teach you to take yourself out of your comfort zone because that will improve you. Some of the things I have been doing have been out of my comfort zone but I have really enjoyed it.'

The 40-year-old has also revealed that the interim manager role he had at the club towards the end of last season has significantly aided his development as a coach.

Experience: Giggs was in charge of United's last four league games last season

Brilliant: Giggs has been lucky enough to play under one of the best managers ever at United

'It would have been stranger and more difficult if I didn't have the games that I did at the end of last season. 

'I had a little taste of it last season, which as I keep saying was unbelievable for me and was something that will be great for me in the long run. In the short time that I have been a coach, that has helped me.'

The former Welsh international admits he misses the day-to-day training schedule that comes with being a footballer, but is more than satisfied doing what he is doing at the moment. 

He added: 'I have been dying for one of the lads to drop out of training to be fair so that I could join in. I joined in the other day, so I have done one session so far. But I am quite happy standing on the sides, observing and watching everybody work.'
