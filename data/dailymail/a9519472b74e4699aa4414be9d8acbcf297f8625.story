These adorable cubs can't bear to look away as their mother plunges into a lake to catch their lunch.

The cubs stood on their hind legs and watched in wonder as their dad used his claws to scoop up salmon from the Kuril Lake in Russia.

The lake in the Kamchatka peninsula is known for having large red salmon.

Catch and kill: The baby bears are transfixed by their mother's hands-on approach to finding their lunch at Kuril Lake in Russia

Stand in line for meal time: The cubs queue in an orderly fashion for a serving of salmon, while their mother does all the hard work

Staring contest: The cubs can't take their eyes off their mother, and only one of them appears to notice photographer Sergey Ivanov

 Photographer Sergey Ivanov, 53, approached the bears by boat and captured the cubs anxious wait to see what their mother could catch. 

The 53-year-old said the lake 'attracts a lot of bears'.

He said: 'Bears are very popular in this area and in the mouth of the river there can be around 20 bears gathering at a time.

'They spend the whole day fishing and I just watch so the bears get used to my presence and do not really pay any attention to me - I try to not impede them in any way.

'It was very interesting for me to observe the life of this big family and especially to witness their relationships. 

What's that: The bears stand on their hind legs as their mother sends water flying, right, as she swings her paws into the lake

Can't wait any longer: One of the cubs appears to be chewing on a piece of wood on the lake's edge as it waits for something more appetising

Game over: The cubs lose interest in the fishing expedition and walk off together in the tightest of formations

'The reactions of the cubs were incredible - the bears displayed so much emotion.' 

The photographer first visited the lake in the mid-90s and has been returning ever since in a bid to snap the bears in action.

Mr Sergey said: 'I saw bears there for the first time in 1995 and even 20 years on they are still my favourite object for photoshooting.'
