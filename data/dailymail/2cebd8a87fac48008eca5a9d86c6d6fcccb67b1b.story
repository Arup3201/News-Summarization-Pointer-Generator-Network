Human fireball: James Bailey suffered severe burns when he was engulfed in flames at the bar on a cruise in Amsterdam

WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT

A stag-do reveller who turned into a human fireball when he fell asleep on an Amsterdam booze cruise has threatened to sue the ferry company for his injuries.

James Bailey, 28, suffered third degree burns, severe scarring to parts of his body and on-going psychological trauma when he dozed off in the ship’s bar, only to wake in agony as he was engulfed in flames.

The man from East Kilbride, Lanarkshire is now seeking legal advice after ferry bosses refused to accept any responsibility for the incident on the weekend stag-do for a friend in Amsterdam.

Shocked bar staff doused the flames 
but not before Mr Bailey suffered first, second and third degree burns.

He still has no idea how the fire started in April.

He
said: ‘After a few drinks I feel asleep at a table on the eighth floor 
bar. Most of my friends were either asleep or back in their rooms.

‘I suddenly awoke in extreme agony and quickly realised my clothes were on fire.

‘The bartender assisted in removing my shirt and putting out the flames.

‘I burned my hand which instantly blistered to the size of a grape.

‘I didn’t see anyone around me at the time, however, there were a group of 20-30 people in the bar when the incident occurred.’

Despite
his ordeal, cruise staff refused his requests for an air ambulance 
because he claims his injuries were not deemed serious enough.

Mr Bailey said: ‘Due to the severity of my burns and extreme pain I was in, I was assisted to the first aid room by a friend.

‘During this time the pain was unbearable and I was completely distraught.

‘I felt very alone, scared and vulnerable. No further assistance was offered to me so I left the medics room and went back to my cabin.

‘Once the ferry docked my friends helped me to my hotel room where I remained for the day before I headed home.

‘I have no idea what happened that night. As it stands there is no one to blame, so I can only blame myself right now until other evidence is found.’

Since returning from the trip, Mr Bailey has endured constant physical and mental challenges as he tries to come to terms with the traumatic experience.

He said: ‘I have constant pain, I am suffering from insomnia and night terrors, and I am unable to carry out basic daily tasks.

‘I have also been referred for psychological help so I can get on with my life. 

‘I feel so helpless because I can’t get closure. I want answers.’

A spokesman for cruise company DFDS Seaways said they were unable to comment.
