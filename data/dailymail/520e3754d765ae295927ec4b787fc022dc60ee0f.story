Kesha Rogers is an unconventional African-American Texan: She wants President Obama removed from office and she's happy to draw a Hitler moustache on poster-size photos of him – and she's eager to expose London bankers as the string-pullers behind everything that's wrong with the world.

She's also running for the U.S. Senate as a Democrat, and leading the pack. The state-wide party isn't amused.

Rogers ran for Congress in 2010 and 2012 and won the Democratic primary both times, despite being trounced in both general elections by Republican Rep. Pete Olson.

In 2012 her campaign produced an anti-Obama music video, set to the tune of the Mary Poppins hit 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' – titled 'Super-Ego-Genocidal-Narcissist-Psychosis!'

It's little wonder the Texas Democratic establishment wants some distance.

That's not Michelle: African-American Kesha Rogers (L) is waging a knife-in-the-teeth campaign for the U.S. Senate and is leading all Democrats, even though her own party wants nothing to do with her

Do they think they're voting for Ke$ha? The latest Texas Tribune poll shows Rogers outpacing the well-funded David Alameel and every other Democrat

The state-wide party has 'attempted to hide our campaign from their websites,' her campaign manager Ian Overton told Mailonline. And the influential African American Political Alliance 'have purposefully said she's running in a different race than for U.S. Senate.'

'The Texas [Democratic Party] executive committee has passed resolutions condemning her candidacy and denying all support or acknowledgments,' Overton said.

'They are more committed to sinking with the ship than returning to the Constitution.'

Her coffers are almost empty, with barely $2,500 on hand and less than $27,000 in total donations. Yet she leads the rest of the Democratic field, according to a new Texas Tribune poll.

The practical oddness of Rogers' platform, which also includes 'interplanetary defense' and Mars colonization – so the U.S. can shoot down asteroids approaching the earth – comes from her allegiance to Lyndon LaRouche, a 91-year-old conspiracy theorist who spent five years in federal prison for fraud in the early 2000s.

LaRouche, she has said, is 'the world’s leading economic forecaster.' He also claims to have invented the Strategic Defense Initiative, President Ronald Reagan's proposed 'Star Wars' missile shield program. 

Conspiracy theorist Lyndon LaRouche has attracted a global following of mostly young idealogues with his anti-establishment messages

Rogers doesn't run from the Lyndon LaRouche name, even though critics call him a cultist and a lunatic

The perennial presidential candidate's broader set of goals includes the restoration of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which prohibited commercial banks from doubling as investment speculators. He also wants to end the NSA's wiretapping programs and re-tune the world's orchestras a hair lower than normal.

Rogers advocates for more NASA funding so it can engage in 'planetary defense' by stationing missiles on the moon to intercept asteroids as they hurtle toward the earth

Overton upped the ante from the concert hall by insisting that the Obama administration is 'supporting the swastika wearing Nazi Svoboda Party' in Ukraine.

'This is putting us directly into a thermonuclear war confrontation with Russia,' he said in an email.

Rogers has turned heads with her Hitler-moustachioed Obama posters, as much as for her other 'far out stuff,' columnist David Freddoso told MailOnline. 

'What can I say?' Freddoso shrugged. 'LaRouche is a nut and he has a big following. Often, when tea partiers are blamed for "Hitler=Obama" signs, it's actually the LaRouchies.'

It was Freddoso who brought Rogers a wave of perhaps unwanted attention on Monday with an entry in his Conservative Intelligence Briefing blog.

The Dallas Morning News, he noted, wrote that she 'has compared the Affordable Care Act to 1930s-era Nazi eugenics policies.'

Regarding the Mary Poppins cover tune, he insisted he was 'not making this up.'
