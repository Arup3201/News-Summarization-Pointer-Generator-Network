Neil Warnock insists he did not question the referee Craig Pawson’s integrity following Crystal Palace’s home defeat by Chelsea on Saturday, but has been charged by the Football Association.

The Crystal Palace boss insists the post-match comments made were focussing on Pawson’s experience rather than his quality, but a statement alleged that Warnock’s comments implied that the official ‘was motivated by bias’.

The 65-year-old claimed Pawson wanted to ‘even up’ the teams by sending off Damien Delaney shortly after dismissing Chelsea defender Cesar Azpilicueta. Warnock also claimed Pawson had been ‘influenced’ by a swarm of Chelsea players during the match.

Warnock said on Thursday before the charge that he was expecting a letter, but did not feel he deserved punishment: ‘You are bound to get asked questions. They have one particular person looking at what we say and do, that’s their job.

‘As long as you don’t question their integrity, and I don’t think I did that, I questioned his experience really or the influence of certain things in the game. But not his integrity. We will have to wait and see. I would imagine from what I have been told I will have a letter.’

Despite Warnock’s comments at the weekend, he claimed he has been impressed by the standard of refereeing this season, though admitted he was surprised Pawson, 35, was put in charge of his side’s fixture against Chelsea.

He said: ‘I have been absolutely delighted (by the standard of refereeing this season). The referees we have had this season have done really well, it’s surprised me. One or two of the younger ones who have been criticised in the past have done well. Even on Saturday, I think Craig Pawson will be a very good referee in the future.

‘What surprised me a little bit is that a south London derby like that, when we get a young, quite inexperienced Premier League referee, even though he’s a good one. People like Mark Clattenburg have not got a game. It bewilders me if I am honest.’

Warnock, meanwhile, has joined the clamour of onlookers criticising the practice of shirt swapping at half-time.

Mario Balotelli has been ridiculed for swapping shirts with Real Madrid’s Pepe during Liverpool’s 3-0 defeat against Real Madrid on Wednesday.

Warnock said: ‘I am not a massive fan (of shirt swapping). I don’t think I’d fine anyone for it. There is a time and place for it - probably the tunnel at the end of the game. I don’t see any reason for doing it.’

Palace travel to West Brom on Saturday and Warnock does not expect Scott Dann (knee) or James McArthur (hip) to be fit in time.

Ahead of the fixture Warnock said this is the most even Premier League he has seen. He said: 'Every game is going to be difficult. I look at Manchester United. Everyone said what easy fixtures they had at the start and they didn’t pull any trees up. I think Manchester City and Chelsea are special but it is more even than it has ever been.'
