Two men who allegedly viciously assaulted another man after he refused to buy 'weed' off them have been tracked down by police because one man had his named tattooed on his back.

The men, aged 21 and 22, were drug and alcohol affected when they bashed the 27-year-old victim in a convenience store in Darwin at about 10.30pm Sunday, police said.

At one point the men, from interstate, had the man in a choke hold.

Two men, aged 21 and 22, allegedly bashed a 27-year-old man in a convenience store on Mitchell St in Darwin at about 10.30pm Sunday

'After the assault they took their shirts off, placed them around their heads and ran around the block,' Duty Superintendent Louise Jorgensen.

'Lucky for the investigating officers one of the offenders had his name boldly tattooed across his back.'

Police located the men at a nearby bar and they were arrested.

'One complied and was put in the rear of the police van,' Supt Jorgensen said.

'The other resisted violently â€“ so much so that the offender in the van got out to help police control his mate.

After the assault the men took their shirts off, placed them around their heads and ran around the block, and police were able to track them down because one man had his name tattooed on his back

'Ridiculously both of them then carried on at the Watch House.

'They will be interviewed later this morning once they have reached an appropriate level of sobriety.'

The victim was taken to Royal Darwin Hospital with serious facial injuries, and is 'obviously distressed about the senseless nature of the attack'.

The men will be charged by police today, Northern Territory Police told Daily Mail Australia.
