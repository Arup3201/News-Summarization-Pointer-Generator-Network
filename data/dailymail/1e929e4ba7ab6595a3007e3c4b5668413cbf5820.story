DJ Hall has had a harrowing three years. 

The 25-year-old has endured a bone marrow transplant, chemotherapy, various drug trials and even more chemotherapy in his fight against leukaemia.

But last year, doctors gave him the devastating news that there was nothing more they could do.

DJ Hall, who has been battling leukaemia for three years, married his girlfriend of two years, Stephanie Lloyd, on Queensland's Sunshine Coast on Tuesday

Doctors told the 25-year-old last year he had 12 months to live and to start ticking items off his bucket list

They estimated Mr Hall had just 12 months to live and told him it would be a good idea to start ticking items off his bucket list.

So he did exactly that. 

Mr Hall and his girlfriend of two years, Stephanie Lloyd, became husband and wife on Queensland's Sunshine Coast on Tuesday.

'I wanted to marry Steph more than anything and to get the opportunity to do it was unbelievable,' Mr Hall told Daily Mail Australia.

'If I didn't have her I wouldn't be trying. She's what I'm fighting for. I don't want to die a young man.' 

The couple got engaged during a whirlwind trip to Tasmania in February, but they never really made future plans to tie the knot 

Mr Hall's only chance of survival is through a $600,000 treatment in the US. The couple have desperately trying to raise the funds and put off any plans to get married due to the cost

Luckily, a Sunshine Coast company called My Wedding Wish jumped on board and arranged for Mr Hall and Ms Lloyd to be married

The couple got engaged during a whirlwind trip to Tasmania in February, but they never really made future plans to tie the knot.

'The wedding wasn't an essential part of what we had to do on our priority list. We couldn't afford to spend money on a wedding when we're trying to save money for treatment,' Mr Hall said. 

Doctors say the 25-year-old's only chance of seeing his next birthday is a $600,000 treatment  in the US, something the couple have been desperately saving and fundraising for.

Luckily, a Sunshine Coast company called My Wedding Wish jumped on board and arranged for Mr Hall and Ms Lloyd to be married.

They tied the knot at Annabelle Wedding Chapel in Ilkley and had a fairtyale reception at Sunshine Castle

Mr Hall said he was so grateful for the opportunity to marry 'the love of my life' 

'To get that opportunity, it means more than anything I could describe. It was something on my bucket list, I knew I wanted to do it from early on,' he said. 

They tied the knot at Annabelle Wedding Chapel in Ilkley and had a fairtyale reception at Sunshine Castle at Bli Bli.

In a race against time, Mr Hall is now just $70,000 shy of having the money for treatment after his mother sold her property, Mr Hall sold his ute and family and friends held various fundraisers. 

'Once we reach that, they can start booking in the treatment. I'm hoping that's reached in three weeks,' Mr Hall said. 

DJ and Stephanie met through mutual friends six months after his bone marrow transplant in 2011

The pair travelled to Europe earlier this year so Mr Hall would have the chance to tick items off his bucket list

The unique treatment, only available in Philadelphia, will genetically modify Mr Hall's immune cells from his blood. 

His cells will then be grown in the laboratory before being infused back into him to potentially target the cancer cells. 

'This is the only option left for me,' Mr Halls said. 

'It's pretty heartbreaking. I couldn't believe it when they said this was it and it's all we've got. It was pretty devastating.'

Mr Hall was diagnosed with leukaemia when he was just 22. 

He had experienced tight muscles and a shortness of breath, which he initially put down to side effects of the flu.

Within 24 hours, doctors had diagnosed him and he started down the harrowing road of treatment. 

'Physically, I coped fairly well with chemotherapy, it was more an an emotional thing though,' he said.

'When you first get diagnosed, you're very naïve. I was very confident and I didn't understand how long the road would be.'

Mr Hall was diagnosed with leukaemia when he was just 22 and has been undergoing chemotherapy, stem cell transplants and alternate treatments ever since

He underwent several rounds of chemotherapy and went into remission twice.  

'Your mind kind of takes a turn and it can be a fairly lonely journey if you don't have support of family and friends,' he said.

Mr Hall met Ms Lloyd through mutual friends six months after his bone marrow transplant in 2011.

The couple travelled to Europe earlier this year to tick another item off his bucket list.  

'I couldn't ask for anything more from Steph. She's always been there. No matter whether I'm at home or in the hospital, she's always there. She's been looking after me and the emotional support has been great too.'

The newlyweds hope to spend 12 months in the US for treatment if they can raise the funds

The newlyweds are positive about their potential trip to the US.

They hope to spend 12 months there for treatment and if it's successful, they plan to move back home to Brisbane.

'DJ has coped extremely well throughout this whole ordeal. He has been very strong and been very positive with his outlook,' Ms Lloyd said. 

'It's inspiring to see someone who is in a pretty bad situation who will never give up.

'I'm terrified of losing him.'
