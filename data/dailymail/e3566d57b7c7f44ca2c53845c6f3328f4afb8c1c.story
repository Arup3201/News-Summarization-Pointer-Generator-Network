Stockholm was alight with flags, balloons and confetti today, as millions celebrated the National Day of Sweden.

And the country’s Royal family were no exception: Princess Madeline, her husband Christopher O’Neill and their three-month-old daughter Princess Leonore all joined in the festivities from the Royal Palace.

Princess Madeleine, 31, waved and beamed for photographs, holding the baby princess with Christopher’s arm affectionately placed over her shoulder.

In keeping with the National Day, the Royals dressed in traditional Swedish clothing.

She wore a brightly coloured folk outfit; a blue dress over a white collared shirt, with a mustard-coloured apron. The outfit is embroidered with flowers and worn with white tights and low heels.

Adorably, she had dressed her Princess Leonore in a matching outfit – though of course the navy court heels were substituted for white socks.

Mr O'Neill wore a dark suit and blue tie.

Swedes 
celebrate their National Day on 6 June in honour of two historical 
events: on 6 June 1523, Gustav Vasa was elected king and, on the same 
date in 1809, the country adopted a new constitution. It became a public holiday in 2004.

Madeleine is the youngest child of Queen Silvia and King Carl Gustaf.

Every
 year the King and Queen take part in a ceremony at Skansen, Stockholm’s
 open-air museum, where the yellow and blue Swedish flag is run up the 
mast, and children in traditional peasant costume present the royal 
couple with bouquets of summer flowers.

National Day also now recognises new Swedish citizens, welcoming them with special ceremonies held around the country.

Not
 normally known for being the most patriotic nation, National Day has 
been embraced over recent years, with some groups even pushing for the 
country to have a national dish, according to the country’s official website.

Also out and about on the sunny day was Madeline’s sister, Crown Princess Victoria.

Princess Victoria, 36, is the the eldest of the King and Queen’s three children, and also Sweden's deputy head of state.

Wearing
 an elegant blue dress with matching blue suede court shoes and an 
elaborate gold necklace, her hair was pulled back into a tight bun.

She was giving talks during the National Day Citizenship ceremony at the Ulriksdal Palace in Stockholm.

Victoria
 became the first female Swedish heir to the throne in 2010 when she 
married Daniel Westling in an extravagant three-day celebration at 
Stockholm’s Cathedral.

Madeline’s daughter Leonore is now the fifth in line to the throne, but only if she takes Swedish citizenship and is brought up as a member of the Church of Sweden.

Princess Madeleine lives with British banker Mr O’Neill in New York, where she works for the World Childhood Foundation, a non-profit group founded by her mother.

Earlier this week the couple released official pictures of their newborn via the official website of the Swedish Royal Family.

The proud parents were seen cradling the baby princess, who dozes peacefully in a white dress.
