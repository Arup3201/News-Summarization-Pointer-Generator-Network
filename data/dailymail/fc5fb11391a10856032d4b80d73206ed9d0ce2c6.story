She's won a Grammy, has been handpicked by Pharrell to join him on tour and is set to feature in an upcoming episode of the eighth series of Doctor Who - is 2014 the year of Foxes?

And the singer, who won a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording, is celebrating yet another coup - landing a major campaign with adidas.

With her musical success and cool urban style, adidas was keen to snap her up to launch its latest running footwear, the Energy BOOST.

The sportswear giant wanted the campaign to unite her unique style and passion for fitness - and as the new imagery proves, she's the perfect postergirl for the sporty brand.

Speaking about her latest feat, the singer, real name Louisa Allen, said: 'I've always loved adidas and I started wearing their stuff last year all the time and it got to the stage where I thought: "it's ridiculous that I'm not doing a campaign with them". I love their jackets they're just so easy to wear.'

The 25-year-old from Southampton is definitely on trend. Sportsluxe, which was seen on pretty much every AW14 catwalk, shows no sign of abating and luckily for Foxes, she's always championed the style.

'I love the whole sexy sportswear vibe,' she said. 'I always loved what Sporty Spice wore and the way she dressed. I am particularly keen on the boost range, it feels like running on clouds, which is great for on tour when I'm trying to keep fit.'

While she showcases an impressively honed physique in the new campaign imagery, Foxes says she struggles to maintain an active lifestyle.

'It is quite hard to keep my fitness up because I am so busy,' she said. 'The best time for me to work on my fitness is when I am on tour because that way I am able to explore different cities by running around them.

'I'm quite lucky that I have a friend who is quite into fitness so she is always putting the whip on me. She is also amazing at juice making, which is great because it is really important to be super healthy on tour.

'I'm not ridiculously into the whole clean and lean eating. I had a shot of ginger this morning and that was just weird.'

Foxes says she isn't that keen on hitting the gym and prefers running around London Fields with her friends.

Speaking about her promising career, she said: 'This year has been a whirlwind, it's so crazy. I couldn't believe it when I won the Grammy. I still can't believe it, I mean there's a golden megaphone in my room for God's sake. It has been so hectic it hasn't stopped.'

While she can't believe her luck, an industry heavyweight is championing her talent.

'Pharrell heard my cover of Happy in the Radio One Live Lounge and invited me to perform on his European tour, which I'm really excited about. I've always followed his career and I really like the message he's putting out at the moment.'

And her luck doesn't stop there. 'I wrote a song for Doctor Who,' she revealed. 'I've always been a fan and so has my Grandma. We were stood outside a Doctor Who conference and we got talking and they called me up and asked me if I wanted to be on the show and I said I'd love to.

'I've never done any acting before but I've always been interested in it. I'm quite glad that they chose to go down the song route as that's more my line of work.'
