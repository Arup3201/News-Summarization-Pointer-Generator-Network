Aesian Anunique Clay, 20, from St Louis City, Missouri allegedly told her one-year-old daughter to 'say your last goodbye to your daddy'

A woman allegedly told her one-year-old daughter to 'say your last goodbye to your daddy because he is going to die today' after a dispute with the child's father.

Aesian Anunique Clay, 20, from St Louis City, Missouri was at the girl's birthday party at Chuck E Cheese when she was heard on the phone telling her new boyfriend to 'bring his guns' following an argument, according to a witness.

After her boyfriend arrived with two accomplices, a scuffle ensued and the baby's grandfather, in his mid 40s, was shot several times in his lower body and taken to hospital in serious condition, said police.

He is expected to make a full recovery.

Clay was charged with attempted first degree assault for her alleged involvement and is being held on a $50,000 cash-only bond.

Several people, along with the suspect, are being sought in relation to the shooting.

The incident occurred on Wednesday evening after Clay became angry with the girl's father because he did not take their daughter on a scheduled visitation day, according to the St. Louis Post Dispatch. 

Court documents revealed that as the argument continued, Clay told him that she was going to call her boyfriend and that he 'better be strapped' before her boyfriend's arrival.

Clay's boyfriend went to the Chuck E Cheese with a man and a woman before a shooting took place in the restaurant. The grandfather was the only person injured.

She told police that she had called her boyfriend but would not identify him. Police arrived at the scene at 8.24pm. There were around 40 people  in the restaurant at the time.

A restaurant worker said several men were fighting and the gunmen pointed a gun at her manager before standing on a booth and opening fire on the victim. The workers and customers took cover in a locked storage area, according to the St Louis Post Dispatch. 

Once authorities issued a search warrant for Clay's phone, police found pictures of her and her boyfriend holding a handgun with an extended capacity magazine, but police are unsure if it is the same gun used in the incident.

She was heard on the phone telling her new boyfriend to bring his guns to her daughter's birthday party at Chuck E Cheese following an argument with the child's father, said witnesses
