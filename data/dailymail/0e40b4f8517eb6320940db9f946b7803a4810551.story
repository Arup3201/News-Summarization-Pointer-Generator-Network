Teenage stock clerk Pedro Hernandez was just a name in a file for decades, one of many people police encountered while searching for a 6-year-old boy named Etan Patz. 

Thirty-five years later, Hernandez is going on trial in a case that shaped the nation's approach to missing children.

Opening statements are set for Friday in Hernandez's murder and kidnapping trial. He emerged as a suspect in 2012, based on a tip and a videotaped confession that prosecutors say was foreshadowed by remarks he made to friends and relatives in the 1980s.

His defense will hinge on convincing jurors that the confession is false, along with suggesting that the real killer may be a convicted Pennsylvania child molester who was a prime suspect for years.

'It will be, I think, an extremely interesting case,' state Supreme Court Justice Maxwell Wiley told prospective jurors earlier this month, adding that those chosen would be in for 'an experience they'll never forget.'

In sifting through evidence that reaches back to 1979, jurors will delve into a missing child case that helped inject a new protectiveness into American parenting. 

Last seen walking alone to his school bus stop, Etan became one of the first missing children featured on milk cartons. His parents helped advocate for legislation that created a nationwide law-enforcement framework to address such cases, and the anniversary of his disappearance became National Missing Children's Day.

The trial is expected to last up to three months and feature witnesses including Etan's mother, psychologists, an inmate informant who knows Hernandez, and possibly other informants testifying against the earlier suspect.

Selection of the jury to weigh the fate of the former deli worker concluded on Thursday before Judge Maxwell Wiley in state Supreme Court in Manhattan.

More than half of them were dismissed after completing a detailed 22-page questionnaire that asked about their knowledge of the case, which has gotten national attention for more than three decades.

Some potential jurors were asked if the lack of a body would make it difficult for them to convict someone of a crime.

Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi told them the case would not feature 'high tech forensic evidence,' but would take them back 35 years 'to a time when the Brady Bunch was still on TV.'

The seven-man, five-woman jury was culled from a pool of about 700 people. Some openly wondered about bringing a case to trial after so many years.

'A lot of time has elapsed, and a lot of things have probably changed. ... It's 35-year-old memories,' one man said during questioning earlier this week. He was not selected.

Prosecutors have spotlighted Hernandez's videotaped, hours-long confessions, in which he says he offered Etan a soda to entice him into the basement of the Manhattan convenience store where Hernandez worked. 

Then, Hernandez said, he choked the boy and dumped him, still alive, in a box with some curbside trash. Etan's body has never been found.

'Something just took over me, and I was just choking him,' said Hernandez, 54, of Maple Shade, New Jersey. 'He just kind of stood there, and I just felt bad, what I did.' 

Defense lawyers say Hernandez' confession is fiction, dreamed up by a mentally ill man with a low IQ and a history of hallucinations — and fueled by over six hours of police questioning before Hernandez was read his rights.

After confessing, Hernandez told a defense psychologist his memory of the killing 'feels like a dream' and he wasn't sure it had really happened.

'You've heard the term "false confession?"' defense lawyer Harvey Fishbein asked during jury questioning this week.

False confessions happen — sometimes in cases as notorious as the killing of child beauty pageant star JonBenet Ramsey — but they are hard to quantify. 

This building at the corner of Prince Street and Broadway housed a convenience store where Pedro Hernandez, accused of killing Patz, told police 33 years after they boy's disappearance that he choked the 6-year-old and put the still-living boy into a plastic bag, boxed up the bag and left it on a street

They factor in about 15 to 25 per cent of known cases that ended in exonerations, said Allison Redlich, a University of Albany criminal justice professor.

A defense psychologist wrote that Hernandez's psychological problems and intellectual limitations make him more likely than other people to confess falsely. Prosecutors dispute that conclusion and call the confession credible.

Hernandez's lawyers also plan to point to longtime suspect Jose Ramos, a Pennsylvania prisoner who dated a woman who sometimes cared for Etan.

For years, Julie and Stan Patz were sure that it was Ramos who abducted and killed their son. 

Authorities said Ramos made incriminating statements when questioned about Etan in the 1980s, though he never confessed to killing the boy. Ramos has denied it, but a civil court found him liable for Etan's death in 2004 after Ramos stopped cooperating with questioning. 

Hernandez was 18 when Patz disappeared. He later moved to southern New Jersey, where he was living with his wife and daughter at the time of his arrest.

A look at the murder case stemming from the 1979 disappearance of Etan Patz, which helped catalyze a national missing-children's campaign.

THE CASE

Six-year-old Etan Patz was walking to his Manhattan school bus stop alone for the first time when he vanished May 25, 1979; the anniversary is now National Missing Children's Day. His body has never been found, but his family had him legally declared dead in 2001.

The investigation stretched across decades and continents before police announced that Pedro Hernandez had confessed in May 2012. He worked at a convenience store in Etan's neighborhood but was never a suspect until police got a tip shortly before his arrest.

Hernandez, 54, of Maple Shade, New Jersey, has pleaded not guilty.

THE PROSECUTION

Prosecutors' case appears to center on Hernandez's confessions to them and police, plus statements authorities say he made to a friend, his ex-wife and a church prayer group in the 1980s about having harmed a child in New York. The prosecution team, led by veteran Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon, hasn't alluded to any physical evidence against Hernandez, and his defense has said there is none.

It recently emerged that an inmate informant will testify against Hernandez, but the person's identity and details of the prospective testimony haven't been released.

In his video-recorded confessions, Hernandez tranquilly recounts offering soda to entice Etan into the convenience store basement and choking him. He says he put the still-living boy into a plastic bag, boxed up the bag and left it on a street.

Prosecutors call the confessions credible, and Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Maxwell Wiley ruled they could be used at trial. The decision followed a weekslong hearing on whether Hernandez was properly advised of his rights to stay silent and mentally capable of understanding them. 

THE DEFENSE

Hernandez's defense maintains his confessions are the false imaginings of a man who has an IQ in the lowest 2 percent of the population and has problems discerning reality from fiction. He has taken anti-psychotic medication for years and has been diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder, which includes the characteristics of social isolation and odd beliefs. The defense — led by Harvey Fishbein, who has handled other murder cases involving psychiatric issues — and the prosecution differ on the extent and implications of Hernandez's mental problems.

The defense may ask the jury to consider that police questioned Hernandez for more than six hours before reading him his rights and turning on recorders.

The defense also wants jurors to hear about longtime suspect Jose Ramos, a convicted Pennsylvania child molester. A civil court declared Ramos responsible for Etan's death after he rebuffed questioning, but he was never criminally charged and has denied involvement. Ramos has refused to testify at Hernandez's trial, saying he'd invoke his rights against self-incrimination, but some evidence about the investigation into Ramos will be allowed.
