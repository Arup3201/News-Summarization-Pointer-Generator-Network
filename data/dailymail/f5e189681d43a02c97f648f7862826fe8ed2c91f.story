Karen Nettleton, mother-in-law of Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf, told the trade union royal commission he got her a job with a company linked to underworld figure George Alex

The grandmother of a young boy photographed with the head of a decapitated soldier in Syria broke down after giving evidence at the trade union royal commission.

Karen Nettleton, mother-in-law of Khaled Sharrouf, worked as an accounts payable clerk for a company linked to underworld figure George Alex.

On Monday she was questioned about payments coming from Elite Access Scaffolding.

The royal commission is investigating whether the NSW Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) was paid kickbacks by Mr Alex's companies.

She told the commission her son-in-law Sharrouf, who is originally from Sydney but fighting with ISIS militants in Syria, had arranged an interview for her at Mr Alex's company.

In early August a gruesome photo of a young boy, believed to be Sharrouf's son, holding a severed head was posted on a Twitter account.

Ms Nettleton's daughter Tara is married to Sharrouf, and the couple have five children who are all thought to be in the Middle East.

When the graphic image emerged Peter Nettleton - the boy's grandfather - told News Corp  he was 'devastated' by the photograph, and added he felt sorry for Tara, the child's mother.

However friends of Sharrouf such as Wissam Haddad jumped to his defence, saying this is what every 'sensible Muslim' wants for their family and children.

The elderly former neighbour of the Sharrouf family recently revealed to Daily Mail Australia what it was like to live next door to them.

In August this shocking image of a child, believed to be Sharrouf's son, holding the severed head of a man emerged on social media

Sharrouf fled to Syria with his five children and is believed to be fighting alongside IS militants 

Last month Joyce told of the quiet life that Tara Nettleton lived, but how Sharrouf would come and go at all hours of the day and night.

She said she was not always worried about living next door to the couple until police helicopters descended on their small road in 2005.

Joyce also added Sharrouf used to come home at 3am after being out with his friends and bang on the door saying ‘Tara let me in’

At the commission Karen Nettleton was also asked about $2500 disguised as 'union payment', and confirmed Sharrouf was an associate of Mr Alex, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

After a short grilling in the witness box, Ms Nettleton left the commission.

The commission also saw prison inmate Jim Kendrovski refuse to answer questions over fears for the safety of his family, after he was assaulted at Parklea jail last week after being summonsed.

Details of the how Sharrouf, ex-Comanchero bikie Bill Fatrouni and CFMEU NSW were all seen at Mr Alex's home.

The hearing continues.

Ms Nettleton's is thought to have helped her daughter and son-in-law flee to the Middle East
