Two thieves were jailed today for stealing from an unconscious teenager moments after he fell from a second floor window.

Leanne Ryan, 30, and Thomas Knight, 45, took a wallet and an iPhone when they rifled through Daniel Courchee's pockets while he lay on the pavement suffering from multiple fractures to his head, face, pelvis, leg and wrist.

They were each jailed for two years by a judge sitting at Liverpool Crown Court, who said they had committed a 'cruel, callous, despicable crime'.

The court heard that Mr Courchee, 19, fell from a window ledge of Knight's flat in Liverpool city centre on July 6 this year.

CCTV footage played at the hearing showed the teenager's fall. Knight and Ryan, who had been a guest at the flat, could then be seen coming out to the scene and crouching over him.

Ryan took the items and handed them to Knight, which meant emergency services were unable to identify Mr Courchee when they arrived to treat him.

The teenager was taken to hospital, where he underwent emergency surgery for life-threatening injuries.

The court heard that it was unclear why he had fallen, but injuries to his neck were consistent with knife wounds.

Knight, who had 90 previous connections, was arrested along with Ryan and three others on suspicion of attempted murder.

All five were later charged with conspiracy to rob, but Knight and Ryan pleaded guilty to a less serious offence of theft.

Charges were dropped against the other three defendants.

Judge Thomas Teague QC said that Mr Courchee, from Warrington, had had 'his young life wrecked by these events'.

The teenager had been due to start a degree course at the University of Liverpool this autumn.

The judge told the thieves: 'Shortly 
after 4am Mr Courchee fell from the window of the flat to the pavement 
outside sustaining dreadful injuries.

Remarks: Judge James Teague QC said it was a 'cruel, callous and despicable crime'

'As
I speak he has no recollection of what caused him to fall and the other
occupants of the flat have chosen not to reveal what happened.

'I
sentence you on the basis that you played no part in causing him to 
fall from that window......What you did was bad enough because you went 
outside to the street where he lay gravely injured and after making only
the most perfunctory attempts to summon help you went through his 
clothing and stole his wallet and phone.

'It was a cruel, callous and despicable crime in which you both played an equal part.

'One result was the removal of the only means of identification carried by your victim which meant the police and medical authorities were unable to notify his family.

'His relatives suffered hours of agony and distress and were unable to make contact and having no idea what had happened.'

The judge added that, but for the thieves' actions, Mr Courchee's family could have been at his bedside.

'His family may have had the comfort of knowing where he was and that he was in capable hands,' the judge said. 'You caused untold anguish to his family by removing any means of identifying him and that makes it a particularly serious offence.' 

Neville Biddle, prosecuting, told the
court that Mr Courchee went out on July 5 with two friends and they 
spent the evening socialising at various bars in the city centre.

He became separated from his friends and when one rang him at 2.24am he said he was with a woman near Lime Street.

When contacted again 15 minutes later, he said he was at 'some girl’s house'.

CCTV
footage later revealed he had gone into the block of flats with a woman
called Carla Shaw at 2.25am. He fell out of the window at 4.06am.

Knight and Ryan appeared within 
minutes and, after crouching over his body, Ryan was seen to pass the 
victim’s wallet and iPhone to Knight.

After
checking through the wallet, Knight went back into the flat with the 
items. He disposed of the wallet in a bin area shortly afterwards.

'You caused untold anguish to his family by removing any means of identifying him and that makes it a particularly serious offence.'

- Judge Thomas Teague QC

Mr Biddle said that a passer-by who saw Knight standing near Mr Courchee had described the thief as seeming 'not bothered'.

Knight later suggested to police that Mr Courchee had jumped from the window of his own accord.

While Mr Courchee's family were reporting him missing, police were urging the defendants to tell them who the injured man was.

Officers found the teenager's wallet in the bin area and the iPhone hidden in the flat.

Rowena
Goode, defending Ryan, told the court that a situation had developed 
between the victim and one of the men present - not Knight - and the 
teenager had ended up on the window ledge.

'Knight has described to police how 
Leanne Ryan had attempted to get hold of Daniel Courchee and bring him 
back into the flat and was unfortunately not successful and shortly 
after he fell from the window,' Ms Goode said.

Raymond
Herman, for Knight, said that his client had been a heroin user but had
kept out of trouble since his last prison sentence in 2009.

He
told the hearing that Knight went outside after Mr Courchee fell to see
what had happened and had gone over the road to a cafe to ask for the 
emergency services to be called.

'What
happened thereafter was truly appalling,' the barrister continued, 'but
he did not initiate the decision to take the wallet and phone.'

Justice: Ryan, 30, and Knight, 45, were each given two-year jail sentences by a judge sitting at Liverpool Crown Court (pictured)

In a statement after the sentencing hearing, Mr Courchee's parents Roger and Carol said: 'Daniel was a normal fun loving 19-year-old when this incident occurred and is a very much-loved member of a close family.

'He was looking forward to going to Liverpool University to study biological sciences prior to this incident.

'At the time Daniel was robbed he was in a critical condition on the ground and the people that carried out the theft would have known this.

'At a time when everybody deserves all the help and support possible these individuals were driven by their own greed.

'They would have realised Daniel was seriously injured and needed urgent medical attention. Their act of theft was callous.'

The parents said that Mr Courchee had suffered 'life-changing injuries' and now required help to do things that many take for granted.

'His treatment is ongoing and the full extent of his injuries will not be known for sometime,' they said. 'We acknowledge the sentencing today but no sentence will be long enough for these people.'

They thanked family, friends, medical staff and police for their support.
