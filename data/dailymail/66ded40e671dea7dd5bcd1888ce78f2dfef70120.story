Police have been called in by the new owner of Leeds United, Massimo Cellino, after secret spy cameras were discovered at Elland Road. 

In a sensational twist to the convoluted takeover saga at Leeds, West Yorkshire Police have launched a theft investigation, which sources say relates to club funds used to install the cameras.

Sportsmail understands that when controversial new owner Cellino arrived in Leeds on Wednesday to start taking charge of the club, a security sweep found the cameras in the boardroom and the toilets.

Cellino called in the police, who 
spent Wednesday evening and much of Thursday trying to ascertain how the
 cameras got there, what money was used to pay for them and why anyone 
would want them installed.

‘He’s
 clearly not thrilled that these cameras were there and the police are 
taking those concerns seriously,’ a source told Sportsmail.

Italian
 Cellino, 57, officially became a board member of Leeds on Tuesday after
 his £35million deal to buy 75 per cent of the club from Bahrain bankers
 GFH was effectively given the green light last Saturday.

The Football League gave him the all-clear after deeming that a tax-evasion offence in Italy was not due to dishonesty.

It is not known who paid for the cameras to be fitted or where the money came from.

A spokesman for GFH said: ‘We have no comment.’

West Yorkshire Police would provide no detailed information about their investigation.

Head
 of crime for Leeds, Dep Supt Pat Twiggs, said: ‘We can confirm that 
police are investigating an allegation of theft relating to Leeds United
 Football Club following a report made by the club on April 9.

‘Enquiries are at an early stage and we are not in a position to give any further information.’Cellino
 has made clear he intends to run Leeds, who host Blackpool today, and 
that GFH - who retain 25 per cent of the club - and their personnel will
 be marginalised.

In 
another twist last night, former GFH employee David Haigh, who had been 
contracted to become CEO in the Cellino regime, quit as managing 
director.

Haigh said: ‘Owing
 to various statements made by and on behalf of the new majority owners 
of Leeds United, I am left with no alternative than to resign.

‘This
 is a matter of particular regret to me since I was the person who 
introduced Eleonora Sport (Cellino’s company) to the club’s owners. I 
also gave them my full and constant support in the Football League’s 
lengthy approval process.’
