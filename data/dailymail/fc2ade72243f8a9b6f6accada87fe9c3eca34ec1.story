For lots of 40something women sophisticated presenter Annabel Croft is a style inspiration. 

She seems to have discovered the holy grail of dressing for women of a certain age: oozing class while still enjoying fashion, choosing just the right pieces for her age and shape.

And now she reveals that her winning wardrobe isn't down to a pricey celebrity stylist, or even an innate sense of knowing what looks good, it is in fact her own 'live-in wardrobe expert' her daughter Amber.

As a presenter on French TV channel Eurosport watched by up to 20million people Annabel is expected to look chic at all times.

Not easy for a woman who admits losing interest and confidence in fashion over two decades ago.

It is only in the last five years that Annabel got her fashion mojo back after daughter Amber took her dated wardrobe in hand.

'I was starting to do more TV presenting so my appearance was important but I didn’t have a professional stylist.' Annabel told The Sunday Times Stye magazine.

'Looking back, I can see that my look had got locked in the 1990s, before I’d had children. I’d had the same shoes in my wardrobe for seven or eight years and wasn’t updating them.  So thank God Amber spoke up, or I’d still be wearing my Dynasty suits now.‘

Amber, the eldest of Annabel’s three children has been keeping an eye on her mother’s wardrobe since being horrified by a pair of those 1990s court shoes aged 12.

By the age of 13 the pretty brunette, 
who is the picture image of her tennis champ mother, was persuading her 
to ditch the out of date styles and splash out on new looks.

In the past Annabel has admitted she isn’t much of a fashion fiend saying: ‘I’m not very indulgent. I'd prefer to spend on my home than be extravagant on clothes’

But a little gentle persuasion from her fashionista daughter has helped Annabel learn how to put new looks together featuring pieces from modern, quality brands like Issa, Acne, J brand, Elizabeth and James and L K Bennett.

Today Amber is responsible for most of Annabel’s working wardrobe choices, even styling up two weeks’ worth of outfits with pictures and notes for the presenter’s foreign work trips.

And it’s working.

Annabel says: ‘Last year when I was presenting the US Open Tennis on Sky, one of the producers asked me: “Who do you use as a stylist? We keep getting emails about what you’re wearing – people love your wardrobe.” It was pretty funny replying: “Well, you’ll never believe this but it’s my 17-year-old daughter.”

Reclaiming her wardrobe with the help of her eldest daughter has done wonders for Annabel’s confidence and she also claims it has helped her career.

Amber says: ‘My mum used to be out of touch with fashion,  but I’ve made her more up to date. Once you’re over 40 you don’t want to be pushing boundaries too much but you want to feel nice. I call her my little dolly because I’m always dressing her up.'
