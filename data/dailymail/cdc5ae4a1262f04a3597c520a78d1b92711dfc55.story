A record high number of workers in part-time jobs has helped create the biggest fall in unemployment for 40 years.

It means the jobless total is below two million for the first time since the recession struck in 2008 – with just 6 per cent of Britons now out of work.

It follows a drop of 538,000 in the unemployment figure in the past year, the biggest since records began in 1972, the Office for National Statistics said. 

The number of people with jobs reached a record high of 30.7million and the ONS said the number of part-time workers also broke records at 6.8million. There are now 4.5million self-employed people, 279,000 more than a year ago.

The increase in part-time workers was largely driven by women with young families, or those in their 50s and 60s returning after a career break.

While the number of men working part-time rose by just 6,000 over the past year, there were an additional 138,000 women with part-time jobs – almost 380 a day.

The fall in unemployment could place the Bank of England under more pressure to raise the base rate from its historic low of 0.5 per cent.

Charles Levy, senior economist at Lancaster University’s Work Foundation writes:

'Unemployment is falling fast, but this is masking signs of a weaker labour market. 

'Our economy is creating jobs, but at a fraction of the rate seen earlier this year. 

'The 154,000 person decrease in unemployment is a remarkable drop.

'However, rather than being accompanied by a surge towards employment, we see individuals withdrawing from the labour market. 

'Despite our growing population, 91,000 fewer working age people were either in work or looking for work in the three months to August, compared to three months before. 

'A shrinking labour market remains a cause for concern despite the economic recovery.'

Mark Carney, the Bank’s governor, had indicated interest rates could rise when the unemployment rate fell below 7 per cent. 

But when the figure dropped below this threshold faster than expected, the Bank did not raise rates, saying it had to take into account low wage rises, GDP, investment and productivity. 

Economists have predicted that with inflation well below the Bank’s target of 2 per cent, rates may not rise until the summer. 

Speaking at Prime Minister’s Questions in the Commons yesterday, David Cameron seized on the unemployment fall as ‘great news’ but admitted there was ‘more work to be done’ as wages lag behind the cost of living.

Average pay grew by 0.9 per cent in the three months to August compared with 2013, failing to keep pace with inflation at 1.2 per cent.

George Osborne last night urged the Low Pay Commission to recommend another inflation-busting rise in the minimum wage next year. Earlier this month it was increased to £6.50.

The Chancellor said: ‘We want to make sure that Britain’s lowest paid continue to benefit from the growing economy, which is why the Government has today stated its ambition to increase the real value of the national minimum wage without an adverse impact on employment.’ 

The number of people out of work and the unemployment rate for each UK region: 

North East, 119,000, unemployment rate 9.3%

North West, 233,000, 6.7%

Yorkshire and the Humber, 189,000, 7%

East Midlands, 128,000, 5.5%

West Midlands, 207,000, 7.5%

East of England, 152,000, 4.9%

London, 301,000, 6.6%

South East, 215,000, 4.7%

South West, 127,000, 4.6%

Wales, 94,000, 6.5%

Scotland, 151,000,  5.5%

Northern Ireland, 53,000, 6.1%

Tory MPs were keen to point out Labour had warned the Government’s austerity programme would cost a million jobs.

In 2011, shadow chancellor Ed Balls said it was ‘complete fantasy’ to think the private sector could generate enough jobs to cope with public sector staff cuts. 

But figures show there are 1.4million more people in employment than there were three years ago.

Tory MP Robert Halfon told the Commons yesterday: ‘We are the true workers’ party now, the modern trade union movement for hard-working people.’

Danny Alexander, Lib Dem Treasury chief secretary, hailed the figures as evidence of a ‘jobs-rich economic recovery’. 

But Labour work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves said they mask a fall in real earnings.

Union Unite’s Len McCluskey said: ‘This is a part-time recovery built on the back of low wages and an explosion of self-employment …leaving millions … without rights, security or guaranteed income.’

Record levels of women in work have seen the number of stay-at-home mothers go into freefall, official figures show.

The employment rate for women is 68 per cent, the highest since records began in 1971, compared with 78 per cent of men. But as the figure for women in work tops 14million, the number of stay-at-home mothers has hit an all-time low of two million. Twenty years ago there were almost three million.

In the past 12 months there was a fall of 30,000 women caring for their children full-time. But stay-at-home fathers rose by 10,000 to 234,000, more than double the number two decades ago. Campaigners said many parents felt forced to return to work due to financial pressures and Government policy, which they said favoured mothers in employment.

From next September, couples who both work will receive up to £2,000 per child to help with childcare bills, to encourage women back to work.

The scheme will allow working couples earning up to £300,000 to receive a 20 per cent rebate per child on their annual childcare costs. The tax break is in contrast to child benefit cuts in recent years, which hit one-earner families’ incomes by more than £50,000.

Lynne Burnham, of Mothers At Home Matter, said meagre wage rises and pressure from politicians to return to work or be considered ‘lazy’ had driven a fall in stay-at-home mothers.

She added: ‘According to David Cameron, it seems you are worthless unless you go out to work, but stay-at-home mothers work as hard as anyone else …[and] receive little support.’

From April, married couples can transfer £1,000 of income tax allowance to their spouse. This will benefit part-time workers and stay-at-home parents – although it will be worth only £200.

Siobhan Freegard, of parenting site Netmums, said returning to work was ‘often not what mums want but is the only way they can make ends meet’.

ALEX BRUMMER: Good news, but part-time work and low pay means there’s no tax bonanza

Welfare reforms, championed by Iain Duncan Smith (above), have made living off the State less attractive

Britain's phenomenal pace of job creation, which has reduced the unemployment rate to 6 per cent of the workforce, is one of the great achievements of the Tory-led Government.

But it has come at a price – average earnings and living standards have been savaged, undermining the tax base of the economy.

That people in Britain have been willing to get on their bikes and get jobs, many of them self-employed and part-time, is a huge tribute to the nation’s work ethic and the positive impact of welfare reforms, championed by Iain Duncan Smith, that have made living off the State less attractive.

The UK’s strong job creation is reaching down to the young unemployed, contrasting starkly with the eurozone where the jobless rate is 11.2 per cent and above 50 per cent among young people in Greece and Spain.

The reasons why average earnings in Britain have not increased, as the market for labour has tightened, are complex.

The main explanation is that new employees have been taken on to the payroll at lesser wages than a previous generation doing the same or equivalent work. 

In contrast to public sector workers protesting wage freezes and caps, employees in the wealth-creating sectors have been willing to accept below-inflation pay increases in recognition that the nation has been through the deepest downturn for a century and they need to contribute to restoring prosperity.

The jobless total has fallen to two million since the Government came to office and the participation rate, the broadest measure of the appetite for work, is now higher than in any other advanced economy in the world, including the fast growing United States.

Yet despite this, income tax receipts have failed to rise by the 6.5 per cent forecast by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility and have only risen 0.8 per cent. 

This makes if far more difficult for the Chancellor George Osborne to achieve his revised goal of balancing the budget by 2017-18.

Many of the jobs created have been in expanding but lowly paid parts of the service economy including retail, hotels and food services, where pay can be up to 20 per cent below other sectors.

Moreover, the jobless rate has fallen fastest in poorer regions such as the North East where average pay is less.

In addition, the Coalition’s introduction of the £10,000 personal allowance has taken many workers out of tax and the Chancellor is promising to raise this threshold to £12,500.

The downward pressure on wages will not last forever. Bank of England interest-rate setter Martin Weale argues that as the labour market tightens, with falling unemployment, employers will have to pay more for entry-level workers, pushing up average earnings.

Private sector forecasters note that salaries for advertised jobs are already outpacing inflation increasing at a 1.9 per cent annual rate. 

This suggests employers will have to improve the lot of existing staff if they do not want them to move elsewhere for higher pay.

Hard work and patience should finally be rewarded better.
