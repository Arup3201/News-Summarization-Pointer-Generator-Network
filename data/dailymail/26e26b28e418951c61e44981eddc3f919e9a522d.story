These astonishing pictures provide an incredible glimpse at the lives of majestic elephant seals in the Antarctic Peninsula.

Wildlife photographer Justin Hofman captured the astonishing images at Gold Harbour on South Georgia, braving the powerful and ferocious creatures' wrath to get the close-up shots.

One of the photographs captures a massive elephant seal seemingly laughing at his fortune in the surf after managing to get a harem of 30 females - all to himself.

The battle-scarred giant even seems to smirk as he cosies up to one of his mates while still in sight of his now love-lorn rivals.

Mr Hofman said: 'They're always making some funny noise. So to have a laughing elephant seal makes sense - they really do make ridiculous noises.'

Justin, from California, spent hours photographing the large male guarding his 30-strong harem of females from rivals - including two smaller males working as a team to take him on.

He said one would distract the bull in a vicious fight while the other would sneak in and mate with a female on the periphery of the harem, which can be 100-strong.

However, with some elephant seals reaching 15ft in length and weighing 10,000lb, fights are no laughing matter and 'always end in bloodshed'.

Mr Hofman, from California, said: 'When they rear up to bash each other, they lift about two-thirds of their body straight up making them stand almost 3m high.

'They slam down onto each other with massive force and their weight, combined with very sturdy teeth, imparts damage nearly every time.

'It's not uncommon to walk around a beach and see scores of males with blood running down their face and chest.'

The wildlife photographer was able to capture these close-ups because many of the males were too tired from fighting to charge him.

Roar: The males' clashes often end in serious injury. The photographer saysÂ  blood-spattered seals are a common sight

'They slam down onto each other with massive force and their weight, combined with very sturdy teeth, imparts damage nearly every time', said Mr Hofman, who observed numerous vicious duels

'When they're not fighting, you can pretty much stand within arm's length of them, just sitting there watching them breathe, looking at their scars and being awed by their size,' he said. 'But when they get up and start to bellow, you know it's time to step back.'

There are two types of elephant seal, southern elephant seals and the smaller northern version. It is named after the males' snout which resembles the trunk of an elephant.

The big beasts can grow to be 16ft 
long and weigh over 6,000lbs, the smaller females are normally about 
10ft long and weigh in at around 2,000lbs.

They
 can hold their breath longer than any other cetacean animal, staying 
under water without air for up to two hours. Elephant seals spend most 
of their lives at sea and only return to land to mate.

They
 were almost hunted to extinction in the 19th and 20th centuries but 
since then the population is estimated to have recovered to about 
700,000 members.

The photographer was able to get close once the males stopped clashing, as seen here. The seal is roaring in pain as it is bitten
