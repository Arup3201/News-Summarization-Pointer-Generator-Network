It was opulently decorated in the style of an ornate Arabian palace, featuring more than 270 precious rubies, diamonds, sapphires and emeralds.

And, while this 1959 Mercedes Benz Golden Angel Wing - formerly owned by Muhammad Ali - is somewhat showing its age, the 23 karat gold-covered vehicle is still expected to get $1.5 million when it goes under the hammer in February.

The original condition of the four-door sedan was overhauled in the early 1980s, complete with Arabic engravings and an interior lined with mink fur, as a gift to be given a member of a prominent Royal family.

Fit for a prince: The Mercedes, known as the 'Golden Angel Wing', was originally owned by a Royal family before being gifted to Muhammad Ali, and is now up for auction

Muhammad Ali was in possession of the car for about two years in the 1980s and was usually driven in it by a chauffeur

The radio is made of gold and the buttons are fitted with rubies. Emeralds can also been seen here on the dash

The hundreds of jewels were fitted and the bumper, headlamp assembly, grill, buttons, knobs and switches are all made of hand-laid gold.

Though the particular history has been kept private, the Royal - a huge admirer of Ali - arranged for the over-the-top auto to be given to the three-time world heavyweight boxing champion.

Ali owned the embellished car for about two years and was usually driven around it by a chauffeur, according to the sale listing.

It is currently sitting in Manteca Ford, a dealership in Manteca, California, where it will be on display for two weeks before going up for auction.

'It is meant to glorify god,' Manteca Ford owner, Phil Waterford, told Fox40 of the car.

'It has all of the earth tones - from the sand to the oceans to the trees and even all the complexions of the human race.

Even the interior doors have fur trimmings

A recent appraisal of the car was $1.5 million and the sellers, Manteca Ford, have already received offers of $500,000

'Muhammad Ali's wishes are that it will help mankind.'

In trying to keep that wish, the current owners, who have not been identified, reportedly plan to donate the money the car accrues at auction towards fight against world hunger.

Offers of $500,000 and over have already started rolling in, Mr Waterford said.

'The appraisal on this vehicle is $1.5 million,' he said.

From every jewel and minute detail, the owners have kept a thorough log to make sure nothing is missing

Definitely not your average petrol cap

Even one of the pedals has been laid in gold

A showpiece as much as a vehicle, the 6-cylinder car has clocked 19,862 miles and was most recently driven from Las Vegas to Manteca.

It is a manual four speed with a column shift.

'I think it will end up in a museum,' Mr Waterford added.
