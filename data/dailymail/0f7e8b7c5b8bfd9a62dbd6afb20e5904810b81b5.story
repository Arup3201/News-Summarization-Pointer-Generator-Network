The 30-year-old mother, who says she's the heaviest she's ever been, happily slipped into a tiny triangle bikini while on holiday in Majorca recently.

And now Chantelle Houghton reveals all in an unairbrushed photo shoot for New magazine.

'Dolly's more important than my body,' says the ex-Big Brother star in the accompanying interview.

Chantelle, who is still friends with her ex Preston, says she is really comfortable with her body

The star says her priority is her young daughter, Dolly, 17 months, and says she feeds her 'healthy, fresh meals'.

But she doesn't devote the same for herself, as she 'can't be bothered' to cook after preparing Dolly's dinner.

'But if I do I have something easy like toast,' she admits. 'By lunchtime I'm usually starving and if we're out I'll grab something on the go, like a McDonald's or pizza when I'm being really bad. And because I'm tired, I want a Coke because it's full of sugar. And then I'll have takeaway at night. I love Nando's as well.'

The size 14-16 star, who is currently single, said 
she used to exercise but her priorities shifted after splitting with 
Dolly's father, cage fighter Alex Reid.

Chantelle was happy to wear a tiny bikini on a recent holiday in Majorca

'I
dabbled in exercise, but I didn't have much of an actual regime. Then I
split with Alex, so I had other things to worry about... I was thinking
about doing Bikram Yoga but I decided against it because I'd have to 
wash my hair every time I do it. I think I'm going to stick to running 
and toning exercises.'

The full interview and photo shoot with Chantelle is out now in this week's New! magazine

Carefree Chantelle also says: 'Who cares if I eat a bag of chips, an Inidian and a Nando's in a day?'

She recently wrote on Twitter: ‘The people that are making digs about my body will understand one day when or if they have a baby. #Proudofmymummybody'.

She also wrote in her own New! column:
'It was claimed last week that I've employed the services of the same 
personal trainer as Katie Price.

'I
haven't employed any personal trainer full stop - as I've said in my 
column, I'm not exercising right now, hence the way I look at the 
moment!'

Chantelle rose to 
fame after starring in Celebrity Big Brother, where she pretended to be a
fictional celebrity, a singer from the band Kandy Floss.

She
met her former husband, Ordinary Boys singer Samuel Preston, in the 
house with the pair marrying in 2006 and divorcing just over a year 
later.

She went on to get engaged to Dolly’s father Alex in 2011, but the pair split in September last year.The full interview and photo shoot with Chantelle is out now in this week's New! magazine.
