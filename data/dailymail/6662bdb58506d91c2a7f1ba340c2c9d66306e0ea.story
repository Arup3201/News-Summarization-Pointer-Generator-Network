Car parks and bribes influence the classification of wines in the Bordeaux region of southwest France according to a new book published today which promises to reveal the secrets of the country's wine production. 

Wines from the region are classified to guide quality and price - the four best are known as premier grands crus classés A, the next 18 as premiers grands crus classés B and the next 64 as grands crus classés. 

But French journalist, Isabelle Saporta, claims wine critics are regularly bribed by wealthy vineyard owners.

She also says other factors including the size of visitor car parks, comfort of conference rooms and architecture of the storehouse contribute to the criteria. 

The book, published by Albin Michel, describes a 'cruel, medieval micro-society' which controls the country's wine production.

According to Vinobusiness the classification of wines is controlled by the wealthiest and that taste only accounts for 30 per cent of the marks.

However, Franck Binard, a director of the council Saint-Emilion wines, slammed the book describing it as 'excessive and hollow'. 

He told The Times: 'We consider that it is not just a matter of taste. There is a wide range of factors.'
