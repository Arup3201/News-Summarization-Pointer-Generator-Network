Roberto Mancini will coach Inter Milan for the first time since 2008 in Sunday's derby with AC Milan.

The 49-year-old, who won three successive Serie A titles with the club during his four years in charge, replaced Walter Mazzarri during the international break with the Nerazzurri having won just four of their 11 league games this season.

'I never thought of returning but I believe in this project,' Mancini said to the Italian media. 'I don't have a magical wand and only through hard work will we be able to return to win.

The Italian is back and raring to go following his return to the club where he won three successive titles

'I have been away for six years coaching abroad, in the Premier League and in Turkey, so I will need a bit of time.

'Inter is a top club and I'm happy to return even though when you go back to a place where you have done a good job, you have everything to lose.'

The former Manchester City manager, who signed a contract until June 2017, added: 'To start with AC Milan is not going to be easy.

'We have a quality team, that has room for improvement but we need to do so quickly.'
