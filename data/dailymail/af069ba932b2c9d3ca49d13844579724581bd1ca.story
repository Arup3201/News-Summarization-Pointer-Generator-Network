The funeral of 19-year-old cancer fundraiser Stephen Sutton will take place next week following a vigil in his memory at Lichfield Cathedral, his family have announced.

In a statement released by the Diocese of Lichfield, Stephen's mother, Jane Sutton, said the vigil on Thursday May 29 and Friday May 30 would give well-wishers and local people a chance to pay their final respects.

Mr Sutton, from Burntwood, Staffordshire, died on May 14 after fighting a three-year battle against multiple tumours, while raising more than £3 million for the Teenage Cancer Trust.

More than 170,000 people have donated almost £4 million through the Stephen Sutton Just Giving page

The total raised for the charity by the teenager's JustGiving page has since risen to almost £4 million.

Friends and supporters of Stephen Sutton will be able to pay their respects at Lichfield Cathedral on Thursday between 7pm and midnight and 7am to 3pm on Friday

In her statement, the 'inspirational' fundraiser's mother said: 'The love and support people are showing for Stephen is a great comfort at this very difficult time.

'We know that thousands of people have been inspired by Stephen's story.

'We want to give all of his friends and supporters, and especially local people who supported him from the start, the opportunity to come and say goodbye.

'We will also be holding a public event to celebrate Stephen's life later in the year which we hope lots of people will be able to come along to.

'People have already been incredibly generous, but if anyone would like to make a donation to Teenage Cancer Trust, they can do so on Stephen's JustGiving page.'

During the vigil, Mr Sutton's body will lie in a place of honour inside the cathedral.

The cathedral will be open for people to pay their respects from 7pm until midnight on Thursday May 29 and from 7am until 3pm on Friday May 30.

Mr Sutton's body will then be taken directly to a private funeral being held elsewhere for family and close friends.

The Very Reverend Adrian Dorber, Dean of Lichfield, said: 'Stephen's vigil will allow a period for people to come in and pay their respects.

'There will be music and reflection, a chance to light a candle and write in the book of condolence.'
