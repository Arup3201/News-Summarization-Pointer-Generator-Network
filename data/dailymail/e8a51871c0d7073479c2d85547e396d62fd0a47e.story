Top Gear has admitted it broke strict BBC rules on product placement by featuring items made by a company headed by a former cocaine smuggler.

The logos of Corbeau Seats and Luke Harnesses are repeatedly shown in cars being driven by celebrities in the hit car show hosted by Jeremy Clarkson - despite a ban such items being given 'undue prominence'.

Corbeau Seats, which along with Luke Harnesses is owned by CM Consolidated, has highlighted its involvement with Top Gear on its Facebook and Twitter pages, the Mirror reported. Mention of the show was absent from their pages this morning.  

Branded: while actor Benedict Cumberbatch drives, the logos of Corbeau seats and Luke harnesses are clearly visible, which breaches BBC rules on product placement

Vic Lee, 59, Managing Director of Corbeau Seats and Luke Harnesses, was sentenced to 12 years in jail in 1993 for smuggling more than 41 kilos of cocaine worth £6 million into Britain stashed in a trailer belonging to his racing team. 

In 2005 Lee was caught smuggling another £1.7 million of the drug, which was found in the boot of his BMW M3 in a High Wycombe car park.

He was found guilty and sentenced to another 12 years, but was freed in 2010 less than half-way into his term. 

Yesterday the BBC declined to comment on Top Gear's links to Lee. 

And again: the Luke and Corbeau logos are clearly visible when actor Hugh Jackman takes the wheel. BBC rules on branded products say a wide range must be used so that no brand receives 'undue prominence'

But Andy Wilman, the show's executive producer, admitted they had broken guidelines on making reference to trade names, brand names and slogans, which must always be 'clearly editorially justified'.

In addition the BBC is not permitted to accept 'free or reduced cost products' in return for credits.

Corbeau’s products feature in the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car section of the show, in which celebrities drive a Vauxhall around a racetrack. The products also feature in other segments.

Mr Wilman told the Mirror: 'I put my hands up. It’s my mistake.

He told the paper that Vauxhall had installed the branded seats and the harnesses.

Mr Wilman said that when he asked Vauxhall about them, Vauxhall said they had received the seats and the harnesses for free.

But he added that it was his job to check product placement rules, not Vauxhall's.  

'I will be putting it right. I am bang to rights. I am going to pay Corbeau and take the logos away,' he told the Mirror.  

'We have never given them prominence over the years because we have different manufacturers for Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car. 

'This slipped under the radar.'

Speaking last year, Lee said he had paid for his crime and wanted to put it behind him.

He told Birmingham's Sunday Mercury: 'This is something I can never get away from but it is something for which I have been punished and which I would like to put behind me once and for all.

'But people just won’t let me do that.

'I have been lucky enough to be given the opportunity to get back into the industry that I love.

'People should view me as a glittering example of prison working properly, not jump on me every time I do something new.'

His first company, Vic Lee Motorsport, was liquidated after police became suspicious of the number of times his team tested at Holland's Zandvoort circuit.

Lee and others were convicted in 1993 of importing drugs hidden in their race transporters.
