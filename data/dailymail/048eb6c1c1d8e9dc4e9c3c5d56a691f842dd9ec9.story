A young woman who battled two years of obesity has launched a fund raising appeal in a bid to get rid of the excess skin from her body after a public hospital refused to carry out the surgery.

Elora Harre, 21, from Canterbury in New Zealand, went from a size 24 to 14 and documented her inspiring transformation, during which she lost 55 kilograms, to her 20,000 Facebook followers on The Shrinking Violet.

When she went for a skin inspection at Christchurch Hospital on Friday after a six-month wait, a plastic surgeon told her she was a ‘perfect candidate’ but they didn't have the ‘resources’.

In a heart-warming letter penned to the Head of Christchurch Hospital and Health Minister, Ms Harre revealed the physical pain and psychological effect she has endured from having excessive skin.

Elora Harre said during her weight-loss  - 'no surgery, supplements, shakes or quick-fixes' were involved

The 21-year-old weight-loss blogger has been documenting her journey to more than 20,000 of her Facebook followers at The Shrinking Violet

The weight-loss blogger, who turned her life around by exercising regularly and eating a healthy diet, said she has been carrying ‘loose skin’ on her stomach, inner thighs, calves, lower back, arms, breasts and armpits.

‘Why is it that despite the fact we are quickly becoming an obese nation, for someone who has done what I was asked and lost the weight that could've cost our public health system A LOT more, that there is no resource for me?,’ she wrote in the letter.

‘I was told this operation would change my life. I know it would. I wouldn't have to live with the excess skin that is not only physically crippling with ongoing skin conditions, but also has a huge psychological effect on my life.

‘It is so uncomfortable to have to tuck your extra skin into your clothing each day, and have an ongoing staph infection as well as an irritated navel - yet this is not serious enough to warrant the funding.

‘There needs to be something for people like me. The people who have lost the weight that is so hard to lose, that you have asked to lose the weight, who are left with grim consequences.

‘I should not be turned away from the public health care system because I am otherwise healthy. We should instead celebrate the rest of my good health as a direct result of my life change, and be able to remedy the one part that is letting my health down.'

She claims that the hospital has denied the resources because of a lack of consideration but hopes her letter could change their minds about the decision and to review the case.

On her official The Shrinking Violet blog, she revealed how she turned herself to comfort food after her father passed away from terminal cancer when she was 10.

Ms Harre said she found herself eating fast-food such as Burger King, McDonald's, KFC and Pizza Hut at least 'once every single day'.

'People used to laugh when you mention being addicted to fast food, like it was ludicrous and that you could only ever be addicted to drugs or alcohol,' she wrote on her blog.

'But the endorphins you receive from eating something so laced with processed sugar that your body thinks tastes amazing becomes incredibly addictive.'

She told her followers that she doesn't share her weight as she believes it stops people comparing to her

When she was at the age of 19, she decided to turn her life around after having fears she would suffer diabetes in the future or an early death if she didn't stop her bad habits.

'I had developed a deep fear of death. I never felt like I could confide in anyone about my fear because for so long my friends had made fun of my fear and teased me about it,' she wrote.

'It was then that my panic of having a poor health and an early death that pushed me in the direction I had needed to go for so long – my only solution; weight-loss.'

She started seeking a nutritionist, going to the gym and doing cross-fit programs, as well as changing her eating habits and has now adopted the paleo lifestyle.

'I have been paleo since March 2013 and have never felt more physically or mentally better and I no longer suffer chronic headaches,' she writes on her blog.

'I have gone from incredibly unhappy, to incredibly happy and I truly do owe paleo my life, and gone from wanting to be ‘skinny’ to wanting to be healthy and strong.'

Ms Harre claims she never shares her weight online because she believes it 'stops people comparing their journey' to herself.

'We are all different and lose weight differently,' she said on her Facebook.

Along with her regular updates, Ms Harre shares her healthy-eating recipes and offers weight-loss seminars, 10-week challenges, eBooks, a support group and a 'range of other things for those wanting to embark on their own journey'.

After getting the thumbs down from the hospital, her Facebook page has been flooded with emotional support as well as donations towards her Give A Little fund raising page.

The appeal, which was set up by her sister Lydia on Saturday morning, has received more than $3000 from 129 generous donors but the girls are hoping to reach $25,000 - the estimated cost of her surgery.

'Elora unsuccessfully sought help through the public system to put an end to her on-going issues. After this revelation a lot of her supporters being the awesome people they are, suggested fund raising,' her sister Lydia wrote on the page.

'With so many people keen to give back to this amazing young woman, I thought to myself, heck yeah! Lets get this kicked off.

'I have set the target at $25,000 which is an approximate estimate at what the surgery could cost. But there is no real target for this - any donation at all is immensely appreciated!'

Ms Harre has arranged an appointment with a private plastic surgeon for April.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Elora Harre for comment.
