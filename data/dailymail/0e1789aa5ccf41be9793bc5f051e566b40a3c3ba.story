Five red squirrels have been airlifted to Tresco in the Scilly Isles to establish the holiday island’s first colony.

Prince Charles, whose Duchy of Cornwall includes Tresco, is supporting the plan to give the endangered animals a safe haven.

The scheme was suggested by former BBC presenter Robin Page, who said the small island – just two miles long by a mile wide – was an ideal location for a new population of reds.

‘With no grey squirrel population there, the reds won’t be in any danger,’ said Mr Page.

‘And if the new arrivals are a success and a colony becomes established, we can take squirrels from there to form colonies on the mainland when the conditions are right. We’re hoping that if this experiment on Tresco goes well, it will encourage other islands and remote places to follow suit.’

As patron of the Red Squirrel Survival Trust, Prince Charles has warned that Britain’s native red squirrel population could soon be wiped out by aggressive, disease-ridden greys.

He said last year: ‘The battle for the red squirrel is iconic.

‘The grey has to be one of the most disastrous introductions  of foreign species there has  ever been. I believe the red should become a national mascot.’

There are up to three million grey squirrels in the UK but only 120,000 reds, which experts fear could become extinct within 20 years. The reds have been ravaged by the squirrel-pox virus carried by 60 per cent of greys, which were imported from America in the 1870s.

Tresco’s new reds – including a solitary female – will spend the winter in a cage to acclimatise to their new surroundings.
