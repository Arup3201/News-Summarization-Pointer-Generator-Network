David Cameron today paid a personal tribute to his great great uncle who was killed in the First World War.

The Prime Minister laid a cross at the Menin Gate in Ypres, Belgium under the inscription to Captain John Geddes, who was the first of five members of the Cameron family to die during battle.

Mr Cameron also spoke of the 'fear and horror' faced by distant relatives who now are remembered through fast-fading sepia photographs as the centenary of the outbreak of the Great War approaches.

Mr Cameron visited Ypres, the Belgian town where Capt Geddes was one of 58,000 British soldiers who died in combat.

Ahead of the visit, he told the 
Telegraph: ‘Like many across Britain, I feel a strong connection with 
all the members of my family who gave their lives in the war.

‘I look at those fast fading sepia photographs and see them posing stiffly and proudly in their uniforms.

‘I
 imagine how they felt going off to war, and the fear and horror of what
 they went through, and I reﬂect on their bravery and selﬂess 
determination. 

‘This means a great deal to me and I want my children to feel the same way.'

During

 his visit to Flanders, where thousands of British and Commonwealth 
servicemen are buried, the Prime Minister announced a £5million fund will
 be used to help conserve, protect and repair First World War memorials 
and graves.

The money has been raised from fines on 
City banks accused of rate-fixing and will be spread over the four years
 of the centenary of the conflict.

There
 will also be funding for new educational materials including 
downloadable guides to help explain the importance of sites and to 
honour the sacrifice of those buried or commemorated there.

Mr
 Cameron said: ‘Next year’s centenary of the start of the First World 
War will be a time for the whole nation to reflect on the events that 
saw so many young people of that generation make the ultimate sacrifice.

‘Nearly all of us in Britain have 
some family connection with that conflict, and it is the many millions 
of small, personal stories that resonate as loudly for us as the big, 
world-changing battles and campaigns.

‘As
 part of that, it is absolutely right that we help communities up and 
down the country to ensure that their local war memorials are a fitting 
tribute to the fallen and increase people’s understanding of what 
happened.

‘We simply 
should not tolerate damaged war graves in our country. Our memorials and
 cemeteries must be places of respect and education. This funding will 
help make it happen, and I am proud to be able to announce it today.’

Candlelit vigils will be held across 
the country to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the First World 
War.

The
 centrepiece of events held exactly 100 years since war was declared 
will be a service held at Westminster Abbey, with a final candle 
extinguished at 11pm – the moment Britain’s ultimatum to Germany passed.

Children
 from every state secondary school will travel to the First World War 
battlefields while streets could be renamed after soldiers awarded the 
Victoria Cross for bravery under an ambitious £50million package of 
commemorations.

At Westminster Abbey a ‘candle-lit 
vigil of prayer and solemn reflection’ will finish with the last candle 
being extinguished at 11pm. 

It will echo the famous remark 
attributed to then Foreign Secretary, Viscount Edward Grey, who said: 
'The lamps are going out all over Europe; we shall not see them lit 
again in our time.'

On 4 August 2014 it will be 100 years since Britain entered the First World War, one of the bloodiest conflicts in history.

Hundreds of thousands were killed in terrible trench warfare.

The war - known at the time as the Great War - lasted for more than four years and its ending, on 11 November 1918, is celebrated every year on Remembrance Sunday.

The Prime Minister today visited the Island of Ireland Peace Park and the Tyne Cot Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery with Irish prime minister Enda Kenny, as well as the Menin Gate Memorial to the Missing where they were joined by the Belgian leader Elio Di Rupo.

The Department for Culture, Media and
 Sport is talking to key partners and stakeholders - including the 
Commonwealth War Graves Commission, War Memorials Trust, English 
Heritage, the Wolfson Foundation and others - about how to ensure 
communities can access the new money, which will be available from next 
year as grants to local communities who apply and whose application 
qualifies.

Frances 
Moreton, director of War Memorials Trust, said: ‘War Memorials Trust is 
delighted to hear about this additional funding and looks forward to 
working closely with DCMS, English Heritage and others to ensure that 
war memorials across the UK are repaired and conserved through the 
centenary.’

Alan 
Pateman-Jones, director-general of the Commonwealth War Graves 
Commission, said: ‘Whilst the Commission is suitably funded to meet its 
duty of care for the graves, memorials and records of Commonwealth 
casualties of both World Wars, it is important to ensure that current 
and future generations understand both the reasons for and the 
circumstances of, the sacrifices made.

‘Such generous financial support will
 enable the Commission to better engage and explain its worldwide task 
and, through this, ensure ongoing commemoration.’

Horror: David Cameron said he wanted to reflect on the bravery and selfless determination of those who fought and died in the First World War

Simon Thurley, chief 
executive of English Heritage, said: ‘We are proud to be playing its 
full part in remembering the First World War.

‘As
 well as protecting other sites relating to 1914-18, mounting 
exhibitions, and sharing our research, we will be working with 
volunteers from War Memorials Trust and listing 500 war memorials each 
year.

‘These memorials represent the greatest wave of commemoration ever seen in this country: listing will ensure that they receive proper attention.

'They stand at the hearts of communities across the land and we want to help ensure that these highly poignant reminders are kept in a condition befitting their importance.’
