A 10-year-old Ohio boy who took the podium to eulogize his beloved grandfather last week managed to move attendees to tears of joy and is now impressing the world as footage of his mature and sweet ode goes viral.

A trepidatious clergyman introduces Orin Jenkins at the funeral of his grandfather Dennis Jenkins, an Army veteran who family describe as a courageous man who lost his battle with cancer.

The priest's worry must have been brief. Orin disarmed the weeping room from the start with a speech that is at times funny and sometimes sad but incredibly raw and heartfelt throughout.

'I'm sorry, I'm a little bit too small,' says Orin, immediately breaking the ice.

He can barely see over the podium to look out on the room full of mourners, whose spirits he is nonetheless deftly able to lift.

Orin relays a story of learning that his grandfather was in the military and how, when his grandfather returned from service, he was no longer allowed to sleep in his grandmother's bed when he came to visit her.

'I got pretty upset,' Orin deadpans as the room erupts in some much-needed laughter.

But, he says, 'I loved my Pepe very much. He was always laughing, joking around, smiling.

'If it weren't for my Pepe, my father Avi wouldn't be here. So that's double the love.'

Orin's speech then takes a more somber, but no less heartfelt, turn.

'I was crying a minute ago because we've done a lot of things together,' he says.

'I believe it was a really bad way to die. And I wish he would have died of old age.

'But still, he lives on because me and my sister still go to school together and learn and that's what my grandfather believed in.Â 

'I most of all learned from Pepe, more than anyone...even than my teachers,' he laughs, before wrapping up.

'We're all going to miss him. But it's not like he's still gone. He still lives on, we still do what he believes is right.'

'I most of all learned from Pepe, more than anyone...even than my teachers,' Orin laughs. 'We're all going to miss him. But it's not like he's still gone. He still lives on, we still do what he believes is right.'

Orin cedes the podium back to the priest as the audience erupts in applause and the camera pans to the American flag-draped casket of Dennis Jenkins.

'Wow,' the priest says when the clapping dies down.

'It's hard to follow that.'

According to his obituary, Dennis retired from the US Government after 32 years with the Army Corps of Engineers.

He was a Vietnam Era veteran who served in the US Air Force, enjoyed playing golf and was a big Ohio State Football fan.

He is survived by devoted wife of 24 years, three children and seven grandchildren.

'Dennis had a great sense of humor, was kind hearted, and an absolutely wonderful husband and best father a person could have,' the obituary reads.
