An 11-year-old boy who wrote a letter to Tony Abbott calling his stance on gay marriage 'pathetic' has revealed he was disappointed by the 'poor response' he received from the Australian Prime Minister.

Orlando Burcham, from Cessnock north of Sydney, wrote to Tony Abbott last month expressing his passion for gay marriage after his mother Cordelia Troy married her girlfriend last year.

He also pointed out that Mr Abbott's own sister, Christine Forster, was in a same-sex relationship and asked why the Prime Minister was stopping gay men and women from getting married in 'this beautiful country'.

Orlando Burcham's letter to Tony Abbott has since gone viral after it was posted on the Australian Marriage Equality Facebook last week. The 11-year-old, pictured here reading the comments on his letter, said he felt 'good' about the positive social media response

Mr Abbott responded to Orlando's letter last Friday but the 11-year-old was less than impressed.

'When I got it back I was very disappointed because there wasn't any reasons,' Orlando told MailOnline on Thursday.

'It was just a poor response.'

Copies of Mr Abbott and Orlando's letters have now gone viral after they were posted on the Australian Marriage Equality Facebook last week.

In his passionate letter, Orlando detailed that his mum – a member of the Liberal Party and a local Cessnock councillor – had to travel to New York last year to marry her partner Marissa Burrier.

'My mother is gay and even worse your own sister is gay! And thousands more are as well,' his letter read.

'You have actually met my mum (Councillor Cordelia Troy) who is a member of the Liberal Party and she was deputy mayor at the time. It is so pathetic that you aren't letting the gay people of Australia and other countries get married here.

'You were elected to represent our country, not yourself. Just because you think it's wrong, does not give you the right to make it illegal. Doesn't our opinions matter to you? Just because you're the Prime Minister, which by the way does not give you all the power.'

Orlando's mum said she had nothing to do with the letter but she had encouraged him to be heard.

'His twin sister was actually writing about how nice the bus driver was and I was going to take it to the local bus company,' Ms Troy told MailOnline.

'I was telling them it was important to be heard so he decided he would write to Tony Abbott and I said "go for it".

'He came in and asked me how to spell "beautiful" and then he came back and asked how to say "pathetic". I thought where is this going?'

Ms Troy said she was rapt with Orlando's letter and the response it has garnered.

'I was pretty emotionally touched. To have one of your kids express something so well and the way he has expressed it is beautiful,' she said.

'It makes me feel really proud as a mum.'

Despite being disappointed with Tony Abbott's letter, which he opened up at his school on Friday, Orlando said he felt 'good' about the social media response to the letters.

In his response, Mr Abbott said he respected Orlando's views.

'The Government supports the current definition of marriage contained in the Marriage Act 1961. Any change to this policy would be a matter for the Coalition Party Room,' his letter read.

'My personal opinion is to support the existing definition of marriage.

'Though we disagree on this issue, I respect the views you have put forward.

Ongoing dialogue between government and citizens keeps our democracy strong.'
