A New Zealand man was left baffled on Monday when police demanded he put his ice-block down through a megaphone.

The man was pulled over on Mt Eden Street in Auckland when three police cars came rushing around the corner.

The police officer, who was using a megaphone, can be heard saying: 'Put the ice-block in the car and put your hands on your head'

Stopping just behind the man’s sedan, a police officers’ voice can be heard booming through a megaphone: 'Put the ice-block in the car and put your hands on your head'.

Calmly following the instructions, the unknown man can be seen throwing the object through his car window before placing his hands on his head.

He then began walking backwards towards the police as instructed.

After being handcuffed, officers searched his car but found nothing.

3News reported that the man was released soon afterward and was only pulled over because he was mistaken for someone else.

Police had been tipped-off by a member of the public about someone carrying a gun, and the description matched the man’s appearance.

A spokesperson for the police later confirmed that a taser had been drawn but not used.
