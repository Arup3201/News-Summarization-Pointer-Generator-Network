A veteran Philadelphia homicide detective has been suspended amid accusations of lying about the circumstances surrounding three murders, as well as the disappearance of a fourth person.

Ron Dove, 41, and on the force for 16 years, has a lot of questions to answer after investigators uncovered human remains and other evidence linking the detective to a string of suspicious coincidences.

The murders and missing person have all been linked to Mr Dove’s 33-year-old girlfriend Erica Sanchez, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.

The search for evidence has taken officials from Mr Dove’s iPad to a trash-filled ravine on the city’s north side.

Investigators have been digging through the area after uncovering information about missing man Reynaldo Torres, the paper said. Mr Torres has not been seen or heard from in well over a year.

Mr Dove is also suspected of lying about Ms Sanchez’s involvement in the murder of Melanie Colon, a cousin of Mr Torres, the paper reported.

Ms Colon, 22, was found face-down behind an apartment building after being shot six times, the paper noted.

Cops digging through the ravine found what is believed to be a human jaw bone, the Inquirer reported.

The find came one week after the Philadelphia Police Department suspended Mr Dove with the intent to dismiss, officials previously announced.

He had been a homicide detective for eight years and was making about $160,000 a year, the paper noted.

The heat first turned up on Mr Dove, according to the Inquirer, after he was suspected of helping Ms Sanchez high-tail it out of the city after being fingered as a suspect in the stabbing death of ex-boyfriend Cesar Vera.

He is accused of hiding her car and paying for a hotel hide-out in Rochester, NY, for the murder suspect while he told internal affairs he had no idea where she was.

The detective is also suspected to have concealed evidence in the 2010 shooting death of Leslie Delzingaro at a bar owned by Ms Sanchez’s father, sources told the paper. Mr Dove was the lead detective on that case.

Even more damning is the evidence against Mr Dove found on the iPad of a man arrested last month with over $300,000 worth of heroin – pictures of the smiling detective in the bar with his arm around the suspected drug dealer

Ms Sanchez is currently in custody and has been charged in connection with Mr Vera’s murder.
