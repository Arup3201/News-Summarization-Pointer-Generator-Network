Vincent Kompany insists that Manchester City are still in the title hunt for the Premier League title after their convincing 3-0 win over 10-man West Brom at the Etihad.

There was controversy in the first minute as Gareth McAuley was mistakenly sent off by referee Neil Swarbrick for a foul committed by Craig Dawson, before Wilfried Bony opened his City account with a powerful finish.

Fernando and David Silva completed the scoring in the one-way tie that saw City close the gap between themselves and Chelsea to three points, and Kompany thinks his side can keep up the pressure on the leaders, who have two games in hand.

'There was nothing to win today for us, we just had to do a good job and we didn't fail. We will take confidence out of this game,' he told BT Sport. 'We just focus on ourselves now.'

'There's eight games left so we've got 24 points to aim for. I think we've won nine or 10 on the spin already this season, of course we can do it but that gives us no guarantees that we will win the title.'

Bony added: 'It was an important goal. Today it was very important to win. We did well today to get the win.'
