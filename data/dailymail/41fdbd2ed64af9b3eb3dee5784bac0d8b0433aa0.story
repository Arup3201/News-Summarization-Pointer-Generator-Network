After cutting the price of a pint, George Osborne would have hoped to be cheered by Britain’s drinkers.

But the Chancellor found himself accused of patronising hardworking people with a Tory party advert claiming ‘they’ enjoy bingo and beer.

Today he tried to repair his man-of-the-people reputation with a visit to a pub, where he was pictured slightly awkwardly sipping a pint - but committed the sin of taking a gulp before the ale had settled.

Cheers! Mr Osborne held his pint aloft, with it still setlling, during his visit to Marston's Brewery in Wolverhampton

Mr Osborne used last week’s Budget to halve duty on bingo to 10 per cent and take a penny off a pint of beer.

In an apparent bid to wood blue collar voters, the Conservative party produced an advert to promote the policy which stated: ‘Bingo! Cutting the bingo tax and beer duty to help hardworking people do more of the things they enjoy.’

But the use of the word ‘they’ was widely criticised, with the Lib Dems call it ‘silly’ and Labour saying it was ‘condescending’.

Mr Osborne rushed to insist that he plays bingo as a ‘happy participant’, and let it be known that he sometimes calls the numbers.

At the weekend it emerged the advert was drawn up and signed off by Mr Osborne and his team in the Treasury.

But in an attempt to win back the support of beer drinkers he was pictured supping a pint today.

Mr Osborne was pictured with a sipping the top out of a pint of Sunbeam ale during a visit to Marston's Brewery in Wolverhampton.

Sunbeam is described as a ‘gloriously zesty blonde beer with a 4.2% ABV brewed to be easy drinking and refreshing with a clean long finish’.

Writing on Twitter, Mr Osborne said: ‘Great to visit Marston's brewery in Wolverhampton with @pauluppalmp. They're creating 3,000 new jobs. From today - another penny off a pint.’

The day started off more soberly, with a cup of tea with the Very Rev'd Dr John Davies, Dean of Derby, after a visit to Derby Cathedral.

Starting a tour of the East Midlands, Mr Osborne tweeted: ‘First stop beautiful @DerbyCathedral-who should benefit from the £20m cathedrals' repairs fund announced at budget.’
