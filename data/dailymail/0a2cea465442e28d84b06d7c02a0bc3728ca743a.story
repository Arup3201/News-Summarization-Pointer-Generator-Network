Plea: Gerry McCann (pictured today) warns the Leveson Inquiry will have been 'almost useless' unless it is agreed in its totality

Gerry McCann has said the £4million taxpayer-funded Leveson Inquiry will have been 'almost useless' unless David Cameron cements its recommendations in law.

The father of missing child Madeleine said the trauma he and other victims re-lived during 16 months of hearings should not be wasted.

The Prime Minister must change his mind on statutory regulation of the Press, he added.

Mr McCann and his wife Kate, as well as 
the parents of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler - Bob and Sally Dowler -
were treated as 'commodities' and left with no rights to privacy, 
dignity or basic respect, Lord Leveson said yesterday.

But having read his report the families do not believe the judge 'has gone far enough' to protect them from rogue journalists.

'I think the only reason we went to Leveson was to affect change and if 
Leveson's report isn't implemented in full then I would say that giving 
evidence for all of the victims has been almost useless,' Mr McCann said.

'For almost all the victims, the reason they were there was to stop 
other, ordinary people who were caught up in the most unfortunate 
circumstances suffering unnecessarily beyond what's happened to them.

'And I feel if Leveson is implemented we will be some way on that route.

'The jury will still be out of course, to it working in practice, but we will certainly be a few steps further forward.'

Scotland Yard’s review of her disappearance has so far cost £2million in its first year after 30 murder squad detectives were called in May 2011.

They have been sent to Portugal and Spain to gather evidence, including a file of leads from private investigators.

The cost includes the salaries of the detectives, translation and interpretation fees, travel expenses and office staff.

Appearance: The McCann's spoke to the Leveson Inquiry almost exactly a year ago but said that their evidence will be wasted without change

Rejection: David Cameron, pictured today at a school in his constituency, does not want to rubber-stamp Leveson's report in full

Giving evidence to the inquiry last year,
Kate McCann said she felt like 'climbing into a hole and not coming 
out' after the News of the World printed her intensely personal diary, 
started after her daughter disappeared.

'Our politicians have now got the ability to do the right thing, and the right thing is to implement in full,' Mr McCann said.

'And I think the MPs have an opportunity to redeem themselves a little bit with the public by accepting this, putting party political issues aside, and doing the right thing for everyone involved.'

Mr McCann said he would have liked to see the Leveson report go even further - making the new system compulsory, providing a time-scale, holding individual journalists and photographers accountable, and making the regulator fully independent.

'I don't think it (Lord Leveson's report) goes far enough,' he said.

'The Prime Minister and our other elected politicians have an opportunity now to do the right thing. And if they do the right thing, for the public, then it will help restore a little confidence,' he said.

'I clearly respect his opinion but I personally disagree with the viewpoint and Lord (Justice) Leveson, as a senior law judge of our country, has made clear that what he is proposing is not a state-run press. It is a fine distinction but without the statutory underpinning this system will not work.'

Speaking about the stories printed after his daughter went missing in Portugal in 2007, he said: 'The worst thing when Madeleine was abducted was the fact that it was portrayed she was dead and we were responsible for covering it up. I don't think that anybody can go through anything worse.

'There were many ludicrous aspects, that we had managed top hide a body for 28 days before we had a hire car.

'Newspapers knew what they were writing was not correct but the pound signs made them print it.

'I would say that having your child abducted is enough to destroy most families but we managed to get through but there were times where we though we might not survive.'
