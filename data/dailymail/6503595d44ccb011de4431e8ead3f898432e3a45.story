Former Vice President Dick Cheney has revealed that he had a signed resignation letter ready for much of his time in President George W. Bush’s administration in case he became incapacitated by a heart attack.

Cheney has had five heart attacks- including one during the month of Bush’s first election- and felt that he had to prepare in case something happened while in office.

During an interview on The Today Show, he said that one of his motivations in drawing up the unusual letter was because he looked back at the medical problems of Woodrow Wilson who had a stroke that incapacitated him but kept him in office due to the constraints of the Constitution.

Cheney said that because there are no such altered provisions in the Constitution regarding the Vice President, he felt he needed to take his own action.

In spite of this awareness, Cheney got defensive when questioned about whether or not his three prior heart attacks should have ruled him out from being elected Vice President in the first place.

‘I didn't seek the job, the president came to me, the party nominated me, the doctors that consulted on it reached a conclusion, the people elected me,’ he said during an interview with Sanjay Gupta on 60 Minutes on Sunday night.

‘At what basis do you want to override that decision making process? Do you want to have an offshoot where we come check with Sanjay Gupta and say “Gee, is he up to the task?” That's not the way it works.’

Opening up: Cheney is promoting a book he co-wrote alongside his cardiologist

Gupta went on to question a campaign doctor’s report who gave Cheney the all-clear, writing that at the time he had ‘normal cardiac function’ in spite of having had three heart attacks and having smoked three packs of cigarettes a day for more than two decades.

‘I'm not responsible for that. I don't know what took place between the doctors,’ he said.  

‘There's no question I think based upon the fact that I did it for eight years that they were right.’

The 72-year-old Republican is promoting a book he co-wrote alongside his cardiologist about the ways in which medical advancements have dramatically improved conditions for patients with heart disease like himself.

Way too big: Because his heart was too big (left), it made it harder for the organ to effectively pump blood throughout the body, and that problem was fixed with the new transplant organ

Unusual: This picture shows Cheney's old heart immediately after it was removed, and it was noticeably bigger than it should be

They also revealed that they debated 
putting in a defibrilltor to help regulate the then-Vice President’s 
blood flow, but they were concerned that a terrorist may be able to 
remotely gain control of the heart and kill him.

The scheme seems outrageous, but it resonates now as it was used as a plotline in the hit television series Homeland where a terrorist used that exact trick to kill the Vice President.

‘I was aware of the dangers that existed,’ Cheney said when asked about the parallels between his life and the fictitious show.

‘I know from the experience we had 
and the necessity for adjusting my own device that it was an accurate 
portrayal of what was possible.’

Art imitating life: Cheney's fears of a terror attack on a prospective defibrillator were played out in this episode of Homeland where the Vice President is killed by a terrorist remotely operating his heart mechanism

During his 60 Minutes appearance, Cheney and his doctor Jonathan Reiner showed pictures of Cheney’s old heart that was replaced with a transplant in March of last year and the size of the old heart showed just how damaged it was.

According to the doctor, a healthy heart is typically the size of two hands clamped together; the heart that was removed from Cheney’s chest was half-a-foot wide.

‘It's one of those situations where bigger is not necessarily better,’ Cheney joked.
