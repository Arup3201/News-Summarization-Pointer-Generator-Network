Retail giant Selfridges saw its website crash today as online bargain hunters took to the web in their millions in a bid to avoid Boxing Day sale queues.

Web customers are expected to spend an estimated £1billion over three days starting on Christmas Eve fuelled by the number of shoppers using new gadgets such as tablet computers to browse their favourite stores online.

Shops slashed as much as 70 per cent off many items and are already announcing record-breaking web sales.

Retail giant John Lewis has had a record-breaking year, seeing its busiest ever hour of online trading at the start of its sale on Christmas Eve.

Today is said to be the biggest day of the year for online shopping, eclipsing sales on 'Cyber Monday' earlier this month.

Online shopping boom: Customers are expected to splash out a staggering £472million online avoiding the Boxing Day sale queues as retailers slash product prices

Quids in: Web giant Amazon is already predicting a bumper festive period of sales

New gifts: The online shopping boom has been fuelled by the number of people browsing their favourite shops using gadgets such as tablet computers that they were given as gifts on Christmas Day

Shoppers took to the internet in a bid to avoid queues like this one in London today

Visitors to Selfridges website were faced with an error message earlier when trying to access the site after it appeared to have crashed.

The site is back up and running again.

Items selling for 90 per cent less than their normal price on some websites yesterday sold out within half an hour.

A further £472million is predicted by analysts to be spent today.

Major discounts were offered by all the big name stores including Marks & Spencer and John Lewis with a total of £1.04billion expected to be spent online throughout the festive season.

Robert Dyas is offering 70 per cent off items until February 7 with Littlewoods offering similar online discounts.

Instead of tucking into turkey and mince pies yesterday, some 1.4million Britons spent their time surfing the web looking for a bargain, spending around £300million in the process.

Just under 85million people shopped online on Christmas Eve.

Credit rating analysts Experian said Yuletide online shopping had rocketed this year.

The number of UK internet users shopping online on Christmas Eve and Christmas day was up an astonishing 86 per cent and 71 per cent respectively year on year.

James Murray, digital insight manager at Experian, said: 'Boxing Day has traditionally been the single biggest shopping day of the year online.

'This year we predicted that Boxing Day would see UK internet shoppers make 126 million visits to retail websites and in doing so set new records for online shopping.

'Things could go either one of two ways.

'Either the boom in post-Christmas shopping could mean our cautious predictions of 31 per cent growth for Boxing Day are smashed out of the park, or the early buying on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day could mean Boxing Day is slightly subdued.'

Web giant Amazon Already said that yesterday was its busiest Christmas Day to date as thousands of customers logged on to buy downloads for new Kindle and MP3 players.

The website said that sales were already up more than 250 per cent on 2007. Site bosses say that all manner of items are flying off the online shelves today.

Its 'lightning sales' – where clearance and low-stock items went online for  just two hours – proved so successful that some goods sold out within half  an hour.

A PlayStation 3 games console bundle, 
reduced from £499.99 to £329.99, sold out within minutes. Canon EOS 600D
digital SLR cameras reduced by 33 per cent from £949 to £634 were also 
quickly snapped up.

Watches
and jewellery were among the most heavily discounted items and included
an Invicta quartz watch with stainless steel strap reduced by 90 per 
cent, from £521 to £52.56.

John Lewis - which started its online sale on Christmas Eve - has already seen orders up 40 per cent up on twelve months ago.

The first hour of the retail giant's sale, between 5pm and 6pm on Christmas Eve, saw a 70 per cent rise on last year's opening - the best ever hour of online sales in the firm's history.

The
store says that all product areas - fashion, home and technology - have
seen record weeks, and more customers than ever logged on on Christmas 
Day, up 24 per cent on last year with a 40 per cent increase in sale.

Traffic dipped between 1pm and 4pm but peaked as Christmas lunch settled in between 9pm and 10pm.

Andy
Street, Managing Director of John Lewis, said: 'To be announcing 
another record-breaking pre-Christmas week along with such a fantastic 
start to our online Clearance is marvellous news, and is very 
encouraging ahead of our shops opening their doors tomorrow morning.

'Many
of our customers clearly chose to shop right up until the last minute 
this year and it's pleasing that we were able to provide them with the 
gifts they were looking for.

'I
hope that we are equally able to meet their sale shopping needs as the 
focus shifts from present buying to bargain hunting. We have some 
excellent products on offer, many with up to 50 per cent off.'

The company said that the number of shoppers logging on on Christmas Day was up a quarter on last year and that laptops, Egyptian cotton sheets, TVs and tablets were the most popular items with customers.

John Lewis had a record breaking week in the run up to Christmas Day with online sales up more than a quarter to £157.8million - the first time the store had made more than £150million in online sales in a single week.

M&S discounted stock online by up to 70 per cent, two days before its in-store sales.

Chris Webster, of technology analysts Capgemini, said: 'Online tills will be ringing all the way from Christmas Eve to Boxing Day, including a massive £300million spent on Christmas morning itself.

'Christmas Day will see a surge in online sales as new tablets  and smartphones are put through their paces and vouchers are cashed in for virtual goods such as movies and music.'Sales frenzy

According to price comparison website MoneySupermarket.com five million, or 10 per cent of shoppers, will buy their sale items online.
