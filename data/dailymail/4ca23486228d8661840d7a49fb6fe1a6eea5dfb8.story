Sweden's most evil couple - a cannibal and a Satan-worshipping vampire - have applied to get married behind the bars of their secure psychiatric hospital.

Isakin Jonsson, 33, has asked human vampire Michelle Gustafsson, 23, to join him in unholy matrimony in a move that has shocked the country.

He killed mother-of-five Helle Christensen - his girlfriend at the time - by cutting her head off, eating parts of her body and then boasting about it on the Internet.

She stabbed a single father to death and then drank his blood - posing in a picture online, before her arrest, with blood dripping from her lips, holding a power saw and a knife.

A caption underneath read: 'I want to cut the throats of people on the subway.'

Jonsson asked on November 13, via internet messaging service MSN, if the fellow killer wanted to be his girlfriend. They decided to get engaged on December 9.

The couple are fellow inmates at the 
high-security Karsuddens psychiatric facility near Katrineholm, where 
they are expected to remain for the rest of their lives.

Both opted for indefinite psychiatric treatment to save them from automatic life sentences. But experts believe they are both so sick they will die in captivity.

And as the usually liberal Sweden is horrified by their crimes, no politician in the future would risk an imploding career by ordering their release.

Yet the diabolical duo live in hope. 
Gustafsson posted on the Internet this week: 'We want to live together 
at some point, have dogs and pursue our hobbies: piercing and tattoos.'

Her cannibal fiancee added: 'I love Michelle. Have never met anyone like her. I want to live a non-criminal life.'

The
 secure mental facility where they are incarcerated is the equivalent of
 Broadmoor in the UK. Some criminals have been within its walls for 
three decades.

Justice authorities have not said whether their request to be wed will be granted.
