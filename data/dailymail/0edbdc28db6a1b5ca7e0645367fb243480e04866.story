While at first glance these celebrity portraits may look like pen and ink sketches, they are in fact painted using a rather unusual medium... fake tan!

Fine art graduate Nathan Wyburn, 23, from Cardiff, Wales, creates each piece in between two and five hours using tubes of spray tan.

His first portrait was of X Factor contestant and now television presenter Rylan Clark which he presented to him at a performance last year.

He has now created fake tan fans pictures of tangoed stars Katie Price, Jodie Marsh and Joey Essex.

Nathan said: 'I love experimenting with new materials and I always try to link the portrait subject to the material I'm using.

'So when Rylan kept making reference to his fake tan on the X Factor it gave me the idea. He loved his portrait. He said he's had loads of free stuff but this was the most personal.

'I'm a trained artsit and using tan isn't that different. It's just a matter of getting used to the material you're using.

'Katie Price took me longer and I used more tan. There's so much attitude in her I wanted to reflect that in the portrait.'

Nathan specialises in creating portraits using non-traditional mediums. As well as fake tan he has used toothpaste, chocolate, candles and even soil, and is looking to start using mashed potato.

The portraits take anywhere from two to five hours to create

His unusual and unique creations saw him through to the semi-finals of Britain's Got Talent in 2011, when he created Michael McIntyre's face in Marmite on toast.

He also made headlines with his portrait of Rupert Murdock made up of 5,000 images of alleged phone hacking victims.

He said: "The Rupert Murdoch portrait was one of my favourites. It was about 15 feet high and took about a month to make.

'That was one of the first ones I did and since then I've experimented with more and more things.

'The plan is to do some more fake tan pieces but I'll let these ones have their moment in the spotlight first.

'I'm also planning on doing some famous Irish faces in mashed potato.'

The fake tan portraits are currently on display at Barnabas Art House in Newport, South Wales.
