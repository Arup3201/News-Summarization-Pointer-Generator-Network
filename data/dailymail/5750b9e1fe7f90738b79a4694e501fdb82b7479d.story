He said he asked her to get down but saw her lost her balance and plunge to her death.

'Literally [my] heart sank. I looked over, she just landed on the ground. 

'I immediately called 911, rushed down to the floor and just talked to the operator ... scariest thing I've ever seen,' Rampen said. 

'She was breathing. It was kind of not consistent, which was really concerning to me.'
