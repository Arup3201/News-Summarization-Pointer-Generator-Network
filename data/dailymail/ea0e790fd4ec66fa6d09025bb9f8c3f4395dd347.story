Queens Park Rangers are watching Blackburn strike pair Jordan Rhodes and Rudy Gestede as they weigh up a January bid.

Manager Harry Redknapp is keen to bring in a goalscorer to bolster his side's fight for Premier League survival and ideally wants players who can bed in quickly.

He has reservations that Rhodes can not play as a lone striker but his goalscoring record means he has to be considered. The 24-year-old has 59 goals in 106 games for Blackburn with 73 in 108 for previous club Huddersfield.

He has scored seven this season and was on the bench for Saturday's game at Brentford, where Redknapp was joined in the stands by assistant Kevin Bond. 

Blackburn boss Gary Bowyer started with Gestede up front at Brentford and the 26-year-old continued his rich vein of form with his 12th goal of the season in just 20 games.

Gestede impressed Redknapp last season also and has now scored 23 goals in 38 games since joining from Cardiff City.

Rhodes has also been watched by Real Sociedad while Hull City failed with a £10million offer for the Scotland striker in the summer.

Blackburn may well have been wiser to take that offer in light of their transfer embargo imposed by the Football League on Monday. They will now be under restrictions to what, if any player, they can bring in. 

There is also interest mounting in Rovers' 23-year-old winger Ben Marshall, with several Premier League and Championship clubs represented at recent games.

QPR have considered moves for the likes of Peter Crouch, Gary Hooper, Robbie Keane and Jermain Defoe but Keane will be staying in the MLS and Defoe is expensive. Stoke want to keep Crouch and Hooper is still struggling for form. A suitable offer for either Gestede or Rhodes could be timely.

Premier League clubs have been alerted to the fact Fulham are willing to listen to offers for striker Ross McCormack just six months after signing him from Leeds United for £11million.

The 28-year-old is content in London but the struggling Championship side are considering means to strengthen their squad elsewhere and a sizeable offer for McCormack would be considered.

Although Kit Symons has steadied the ship, Fulham are still 10 points off the play-off places following their poor start under Felix Magath and their prospects of promotion look slim. They are evaluating the squad and are prepared to make changes in January.

Aston Villa are also among clubs keen on midfielder Bryan Ruiz. There is interest in the 29-year-old Costa Rica star from Holland and Spain also but Paul Lambert hopes to persuade him to make a quick return to the Premier League with Villa.

Gremio want Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva. The 27-year-old is in and out of Brendan Rodgers' side at the moment and the Brazilian club sense he could be open to a return home.

Lucas, however, has made it clear he would prefer to stay at Anfield if he has a fair chance of contributing. Napoli have been linked consistently also but Rafa Benitez is struggling to get the financial support he wants to push the Italian club forward.

Liverpool want to sell to raise money for January re-inforcements and Italian striker Fabio Borini is at the top of that list. 

The club hope to raise around £10m to £12m for the 24-year-old but may yet find a replacement on loan rather than commit even more transfer funds with Daniel Sturridge due back from injury and Divock Origi arriving in the summer.

Manchester United are looking at Belgian brothers Indy and Seppe Boonen.

Indy, 15, is a left back who left Genk last year and has already had trials at United. He is training with United's youth sides at the moment while his younger brother 13-year-old Seppe is a promising goalkeeper. They are hoping to sign a professional contract with United when they turn 16.

United have held off competition from neighbours Manchester City to sign Portuguese winger Venancio da Silva Monteiro. The 15-year-old left Benfica in April to train with United in the hope of winning a deal but his performances had attracted interest from City who were also keen to sign him.

West Ham are reviving interest in Sporting Lisbon striker Islam Slimani.

The 26-year-old Algeria forward impressed at the World Cup and is keen on a move to the Premier League. One concern though is Slimani's involvement in the Africa Cup of Nations.

West Ham will listen to offers for Mauro Zarate. The 27-year-old forward has been used sparingly this season and wants more game time.

West Ham will need cover for Diafra Sakho, who is also due at the Africa Cup of Nations in January but Zarate wants a regular role. 

He wants to play for his adopted country Chile when they host the 2015 Copa America but will struggle to stake a claim having played just eight games this season.

Southampton are among clubs to have shown an interest so far but Zarate also has clubs from Spain, Brazil and Italy who are keen to take him either permanently or on loan.

Orlando City are closing on a deal for Stoke City winger Brek Shea.

Former Everton and Manchester City midfielder Adrian Heath is in charge of the MLS side and hopes to wrap up the transfer in the coming days.

The 24-year-old Shea has struggled to win a first team role at the Britannia Stadium since the club fought to secure him a work permit in January 2013. The £2.5m signing has only made one start, in the League Cup, and has struggled to make a positive impression in loan spells at Barnsley and Birmingham City.

Shea trained with Orlando in the summer but insisted he still wanted to prove himself in Europe.

Swansea City are keen to make Tom Carroll's loan from Tottenham into a permanent deal. 

The 22-year-old has impressed manager Garry Monk and is happy to make the switch from White Hart Lane, where competition among midfielders is fierce. 

Tottenham want to bring in three or four players themselves in January but are struggling to offload some of their surplus squad members. Swansea also have a liking for Kyle Naughton. Monk is in talks over bringing in a new full-back and a defensive midfielder with Exeter's Matt Grimes a confirmed target.

A striker is also on Monk's wishlist with Manchester City, Liverpool and Tottenham among those continuing to admire £20m-rated Wilfried Bony.
