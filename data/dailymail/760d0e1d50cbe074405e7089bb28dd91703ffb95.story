Leicester City have announced the signing of veteran goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer from Chelsea on a free transfer.

The 42-year-old has joined on a one-and-a-half year deal and is likely to go straight into the team with regular number one with Kasper Schmeichel absent with a foot injury.

Schwarzer was third choice at the Blues behind Thibaut Courtois and Petr Cech and had not played for the west London club this season.

In Schmeichel's absence Ben Hamer has filled the void - with the Foxes conceding seven goals in five games since.

Schwarzer's experience will prove vital to the East Midlands outfit who sit four points adrift from safety at the bottom of the table.

The former Australian international's departure from Chelsea also indicates that Petr Cech is likely to remain at Stamford Bridge until the end of the season at least. 

Cech has been linked with a January move away from west London after losing his place to Courtois in goal; but that possibility looks remote as Jose Mourinho's side continue to fight on four fronts for silverware.

 Schwarzer explained his reason for choosing to sign for the Foxes telling the club's official website: 'Automatically, when I got here, I got a great buzz and feel about the club.

'The opportunity to work with Nigel Pearson, who I played with back at Middlesbrough, and to be more involved and play more football.

'At Chelsea I didn't play a lot and the last six months has been the toughest part when I haven't been involved at all at times.

'The opportunity of playing some games is very enticing for me.' 

The Australian international is part of an elite goalkeepers' group, alongside Petr Cech and David James, to have kept 150 Premier League clean sheets.

The experienced stopper has also made over 500 Barclays Premier League appearances for Middlesbrough, Fulham and the Blues over an 18-year period.
