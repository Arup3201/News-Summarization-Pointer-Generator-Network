A South Carolina boy's 'superpowered' red-and-yellow prosthesis lets him use his right hand for new activities.

Ty'rez Johnson's right hand, which has no fingers  due to Amniotic Band Syndrome, was fitted with the device, WSCS reported.

His grandmother Gail Gorman told the television station 'Kids at school, you know, people would stare at him and always look at him and say, "What happened to your hand?" and he would just say, "You know, that's just the way God made me."'

She continued, 'He's always been very, um, nonchalant, called it his little hand.'

However, she also said 'But there are certain things that he can't do, um, that he wanted to do, that his brothers and sisters were doing.'

Johnson's occupational therapy assistant Courtney Pressley brought up the idea of a prosthesis, WCSC reported.

Gorman told the media outlet 'Courtney asked me if we had considered a prosthetic hand for him. And I said, "Well, not really, because he does so well with his little hand that we really hadn't thought about that nor could we afford it."'

Johnson received his 3D-printer created 'Iron Man Hand' after he was deemed a candidate for Dr. Albert Chi's study at Johns Hopkins which Pressley discovered, WCSC reported.

The doctor is also associated with Enabling the Future, the affiliate station reported.

Enabling the Future describes itself on its website as 'A network of passionate volunteers using 3D printing to give the World a "Helping Hand."

Footage filmed by WSCS shows Johnson uses his 'Iron Man Hand' to grasp a baseball bat, wave his right hand, and even ride on a swingset.

The hand was produced for a mere $50, the affiliate station reported.  

Johnson's prosthesis is not the only superhero-themed device out there: Enabling the Future volunteer Aaron Brown even created a prosthesis for a child that meant to look like the hand of X-Men character Wolverine - with claws included.
