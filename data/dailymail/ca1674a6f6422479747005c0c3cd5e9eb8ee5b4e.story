They were unveiled to much fanfare as a cool new addition to London's streets.

But the state-of-the-art Routemaster buses have left passengers fuming after a faulty air conditioning caused temperatures on board to soar.

Heat levels on some of the buses were found to have exceeded the maximum allowed for transporting farm animals across Europe.

Upper-deck heat levels were recorded at more than 30C, according to an Evening Standard investigation.

The problem on the new double-deckers, christened 'Boris Buses' after the London mayor who introduced them at a cost of £354,500 each, is caused by air-conditioning faults and the absence of opening windows.

Transport for London today admitted the buses had 'teething problems' and encouraged concerned passengers to complain.

The problem led to the buses being branded 'cauldrons on wheels' after windows were omitted by their designer Thomas Heatherwick — best known for his Olympic cauldron.

He feared that they would 'ruin the efficiency' of the on-board cooling units.

Temperatures recorded at 1pm yesterday on the upper deck of a No 24 bus reached 30.4C, more than 7C hotter than outside.

Humidity hit 77 per cent — almost double that on the Tube and 15 points higher than Asian countries such as Malaysia.

Last month route 24, between Pimlico and Hampstead Heath, became the first run entirely with the new buses.

TfL is to roll out 600 of the buses, built by Wrightbus in Northern Ireland, by 2016 at a cost of £212 million.

Route 11, which runs between Liverpool Street station and Fulham Broadway, will convert on September 21.

The buses, described by the Mayor as 'a brilliant feat of British engineering', were first trialled on route 38 — where several continue to operate alongside conventional double-deckers — 18 months ago.

Mike Weston, operations director for London Buses, told the London Evening Standard: 'We are aware of some technical issues with the ventilation and air chill system on some of the New Bus for London vehicles on Route 24. Our suppliers are working to fix the issue as soon as possible. 

'Sauna on wheels': The new Routemaster bus has been slammed for leaving passengers sweltering in the heat

Problem: Designer Thomas Heatherwick feared windows would ruin the efficiency of the air conditioning units on the new Routemasters

As you would expect with the introduction of a large fleet of new buses, there will be teething problems and we are working hard to minimise the impact of these on our customers.'

Passengers went on Twitter to express their fury. One described the conditions as 'hotter than magma'.

Another dubbed the buses 'moving saunas'. Others called on TfL to hand out water to passengers.

The problem was revealed as TfL published its 'beat the heat' plan for summer — and as forecasters warned that London was set to experience the hottest day of the year on Sunday, with a 27C peak.

Nursery nurse Lucyanna Hiscock, 25, from Pimlico, said: 'Everyone I know hates the buses.

'They look nice but there are no windows and the air conditioning doesn't work.

'And at night they close the back doors so you're completely shut in. It was so hot the other day I thought I was going to faint.'

TfL said: 'We ask any passenger who feels our service falls below what they expect — for example the bus air cooling system not working — to contact us. Concerns will be fully investigated.'
