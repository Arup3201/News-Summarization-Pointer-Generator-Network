The complimentary superlatives were being heaped on Kevin Mitchell after he reduced a seasoned Mexican to pulp to set up the third world lightweight title challenge of his career.

Brilliant, devastating, lightning, punch-perfect, clinical…world-class even.

The 30-year-old Londoner himself kept using a different buzz-word: 'Security.'

For the first time in a major fight, Mitchell revealed after his eighth-round stoppage of Daniel Estrada at the 02 Arena, he felt comfortable in his skin.

It was the rejection of a drinker's lifestyle and the dedication to boxing which made that possible.

'Security,' he said. 'That's what giving up the booze, eating right and training proper have given me.'

He had used the same word in the build up to the stunning victory which establishes him as the mandatory challenger to Venezuela's WBC champion Jorge Linares: 'I'm fighting for the security of my sons.'

Those boys sat proudly next to him in his dressing room as he said it about his retrieval of his career from two previous world tiitle shots squandered in the bar: 'Because I prepared properly I felt secure throughout the fight.

'I felt strong, confident in what I could do. Sure of winning. Without doubts. I knew I had what it takes to go the distance if necessary.

Mitchell says the rejection of his previous lifestyle and having 'security' has helped turn his career around 

It was a blistering display by Mitchell, who boxed superbly throughout and was too much for his opponent 

'Before big fights in the past I would be so tense and nervous for days that I would catch myself with my hands shaking even when I was just chatting with my mates. Not now.'

A new trainer, Tony Simms, and a steadying girlfriend, Jodie, have kept him on the straight and narrow: 'They won't let me go off track again. Not that I want to. What I need most now is to become a world champion.'

Mitchell may have to be a little patient. The WBC may grant Linares a voluntary first defence of his newly-won title in April.

But Mitchell's chance should come in the summer. And if he keeps his head as straight as his punches were accurate on Saturday night then his redemption from near-self destruction will have come just in time to bring another world title to Britain.

Yesterday's victory against Mexican Estrada takes Mitchell's record to an impressive 39-2
