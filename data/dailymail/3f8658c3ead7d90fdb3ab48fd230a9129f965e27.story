You've long been able to get a drive-thru burger. Now a church is offering drive-thru sustenance for the soul. 

Holy Spirit Church in Fremont, California, lets drivers park in the car park before being blessed by its pastor through their window.

The first drive-thru service on November 17 proved so popular it will now run every weekday evening between 5pm and 6pm.

Pastor of the Holy Spirit, Rev. Matthew Vellankal, came up with idea for the service after hearing about a pastor in Florida running a similar event. 

A quote from Pope Francis also inspired him to bring the service to Fremont. 

'Pope Francis says we should go where the people are,' Vellankal said.

The church had been promoting drive-thru prayer through its newsletter and by word of mouth. 

And then parishioner Lalu Paul stood at the busy intersection of Fremont Boulevard and Central Avenue during the Monday evening rush hour waving a sign that read 'Drive-Thru Prayer.'

Around 35 motorists arrived during the service’s first hour - with one individual even arriving on bike.

Each visitor spends a few minutes praying with the pastor.

Rev. Vellankal added: 'We live in a fast-paced society and if people don’t have an hour to pray, they might have a few minutes.

'So we want to offer a little comfort and solace to people who are extremely busy.'

The Catholic Church, founded in 1886, is one of the area’s oldest churches. 

With 5,000 parishioners, it’s also one of the larges.
