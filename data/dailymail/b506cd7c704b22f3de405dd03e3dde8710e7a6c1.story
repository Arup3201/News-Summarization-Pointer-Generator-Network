Chelsea striker Diego Costa has returned to the Spain squad for the forthcoming matches against Ukraine and Holland.

The Brazil-born forward was omitted from Vicente del Bosque's squad for the November games against Belarus and Germany because of a niggling hamstring problem, but is now back in the fold.

His Chelsea team-mate Cesc Fabregas has also returned to the squad, along with Manchester City playmaker David Silva and Barcelona star Andres Iniesta.

Costa has been in superb form for the Blues this season, scoring 18 goals in 33 appearances so far 

Goalkeepers: Casillas, De Gea, 

Defenders: Asenjo; Juanfran, Carvajal, Pique, Bartra, Ramos, Albiol, Alba, Bernat

Midfielders: Suarez, Busquets, San Jose, Silva, Pedro, Fabregas, Cazorla, Iniesta, Koke, Isco 

Forwards: Vitolo, Costa, Morata.

Del Bosque has also brought in Sevilla winger Vitolo and Villarreal goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo for possible senior debuts in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Ukraine in Seville on March 27 or in the friendly away to Holland on March 31.

Del Bosque told the Spanish national team's official Twitter account @sefutbol: 'We have brought Vitolo into our path. We can use him on the left-hand side. Sergio Asenjo is playing well for Villarreal and that has been rewarded.'

Valencia forward Paco Alcacer has missed out on this occasion, with Del Bosque judging that he was not 100 per cent fit as he makes his recovery from a knee injury.
