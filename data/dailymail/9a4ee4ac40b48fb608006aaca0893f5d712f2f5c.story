A social media post helped put a wanted sex offender behind bars when it made its way to the predator's landlord.

Wisconsin woman Jess Quilling said she knew something was off about the man her family had rented a room to, but she didn't realize just how right her instincts were until she started investigating him online.

Though his mail had been coming in under a variety of different names, they confirmed his real identity was Shawn Anderson when they spotted his name on a wanted poster for child molestation and incest.

'His lies just kept piling and he couldn't keep track of (them),' Quilling told Fox 59.  

Upon discovering his real history, she says she was appalled. 

'(I was in) shock. Disgusted. Rage is a good word,' she said.

She and her husband immediately turned him over to the authorities.

Police said they had been hunting for Anderson since December.  

'I’ve seen some of the worst pictures in the world, thinking there was no way anyone (could) identify this person. Then when it gets put on social media, within minutes … we have five tips with the same name,' said Steve Dubois of Crime Stoppers of Central Indiana.

Without Quilling's instincts he might very well still be on the loose.  

Quilling said she's grateful Anderson only stayed a short time but worried what could have happened in the days when such information was not readily available. 

Though they may have asked him to leave, its unlikely they would have discovered the full extent of his crimes.  

'Even 20 years ago, there’s no way we would’ve ever found him. … He was planning on going down south, either to Florida or Kentucky … and it was with a friend that had children,' she said.
