Syria's first lady Asma al-Assad has denied claims that she has left the war-torn country in a show of support for her husband.

State television aired footage of Mrs Al-Assad insisting that she has been in Syria all along with President Bashar al-Assad and their children.

The clip showed the first lady planting trees with children and comforting the bereaved.

She was wearing a grey t-shirt with a Syrian flag printed on the front.

When asked about rumours that she was no longer in Syria, Mrs al-Assad said: 'I am here, my husband and my children are here in Syria. It's obvious that I'd be here with them.

'How can I teach my children to love Syria if they don't live here?

According to the Daily Telegraph, she added: 'I was here yesterday, I'm here today and I will be here tomorrow.'

The footage comes a little more than a month after Mrs al-Assad, who was born in Britain, was criticised for a shameless PR stunt which saw a number of pictures of her helping some of the country's refugees.

She was photographed ladling out soup to starving youngsters and comforting some of the countries bereaved families.

Posed? The pictures provoked much criticism with Mrs al-Assad being described as a Marie Antoinette type figure after the pictures were posted on the Syrianpresidency Instagram page

Mrs al-Assad has been accused of becoming more of a Marie Antoinette figure, completely out of touch with what is happening around her.

She has reportedly continued shopping for designer clothes and health products despite more than 100,000 people having been killed since the start of violence in the country in the spring of 2011.

'I love ur designer clothes and shoes... paid for by the blood of your people! Seriously, u make Marie Antoinette look like an angel compared to you!,' wrote one Instagram user in response to a photograph.

'I was here yesterday, I'm here today and I will be here tomorrow.'

Others commented on the 'hypocrisy' of Mrs al-Assad being pictured caring for young people when tens of thousands of children have died in the two-year Syrian war.

But despite her appearances in publicity shots on social media sites, Mrs al-Assad has rarely been seen in public since the conflict in Syria begun.

Although this week's broadcast was intended as a show of strength and unity with her husband, it is unclear when the footage was actually recorded.

The first lady grew up and was educated in London, studying at King's College and working as a banker at JP Morgan.

Though a Muslim, Asma Assad went to a Church of England school, where she was known as Emma.

She met her future husband while working for the bank - he was training in London at the time to become an eye surgeon.

The pair married in 2000.

Mrs al-Assad was rumoured to have been pregnant earlier in the year.

State television footage also showed her husband attending prayers in a mosque in Damascus to mark Eid al-Adha.

The broadcast was aired as an Imam in a rebel-stronghold of the Syrian capital Damascus issued a fatwa allowing people to eat cats and dogs in a bid to stave off starvation.

Cleric Salah al-Khatib reportedly lifted Islamic restrictions after medical and food supplies to the area were choked off by President al-Assad's forces.

According to the Daily Telegraph, he said the move was a 'reflection of the reality we are suffering' and not religiously permitted.
