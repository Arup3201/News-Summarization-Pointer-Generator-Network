Danny Welbeck admits he is frustrated by his failure to hold down a first-team place up front for Manchester United.

The England forward wants a central role for club and country to prove he can score goals regularly at the highest level.

Welbeck has scored eight times in 21 appearances for England but spent most of the season struggling for form at United under David Moyes.

‘It does get frustrating,’ said the 23-year-old. ‘You want to be playing in a certain position and you’re not getting the opportunity to do that.

‘Maybe I’m kind of let off the leash a bit more for England.

‘For United I’m more likely to be left wing of a four-man midfield with only two centre-mids so it’s a bit more difficult for me to make runs to score when I’ve got to think about my defensive duties as well.

‘I wouldn’t say I play better for England but my goals-per-game ratio is definitely better.

Ring the changes? It is unknown how Louis van Gaal will use Welbeck next season

‘I’m much freer up front on the left for England — with three in midfield there’s a bit more defensive cover rather than me being that defensive cover.’

Welbeck also said he was shocked by Moyes’s criticism of his attitude when results turned against the manager.

‘I was pretty surprised to be honest,’ he said. ‘He (Moyes) did come out with that statement but before then I was doing extra training and maybe he just didn’t see it.’
