The mother of an Australian teenager who caused one of the biggest upsets in Wimbledon history when he knocked out world No.1 Rafael Nadal from the competition says her son can do it again.

In the early hours of Wednesday morning, Canberra's Nick Kyrgios won the hearts of Australians everywhere when he became the first teenager to defeat a world No.1 since Nadal did it against Roger Federer at Roland Garros in 2005.

On Thursday morning, the world No.144 will try to pull of another win against Canadian eighth seed Milos Raonic for a place in the semi-finals.

Norlaila Kyrgios says her son can beat Milos Raonic for a place in the Wimbledon semi-finals

Kyrgios' mother, Norlaila, told A Current Affair she had complete confidence her son would advance to the next round after he defeated the Spanish top seed in just under three hours, saying she thinks he will go 'all out'.

Ms Kyrgios - who watched the teenager's triumph from her Canberra home - said despite being believing in him since the 19-year-old first picked up the racket, she had her doubts about whether or not he could pull off the upset.

'I guess I said something about Nadal being too strong for him and he heard me and he got a bit angry about that, so I think that drove him a bit more just to prove me wrong,' she said.

Kyrgios defeated Nadal 7-6 (7-5) 5-7 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 and told reporters after the match he had read what his mother had said.

'Last night, I was reading a comment that she thought Rafa was too good for me,' Kyrgios said.

'It actually made me a bit angry.'

Though his family is tight-knit, his mother and brother, Christos, have remained at home in Canberra while his father, George, and sister Halimah made the trip with Kyrgios to Wimbledon.

Ms Kyrgios said she was happy, proud and exhausted.

'It may seem like he just burst onto the scene but it's a long road and a lot of hard work,' she said.
