Former Barcelona defender Eric Abidal has backed Lionel Messi to remain at the club for the rest of his career and rejected speculation the Argentina international could soon leave.

Rumours surrounding Messi's future at the Catalan side have intensified in recent weeks but with Barcelona set to undergo a transfer ban for the next two windows, Abidal believes Messi will remain and make sure the team remains one of Europe's superpowers.

'I know Leo well,' Abidal said. 'He is a well educated guy, he's not here to screw the club and others. He has character, he respects people.

Transfer gossip has linked Messi with a move away from Barcelona with Chelsea reportedly eyeing a move

But Eric Abidal (right), who used to play with Messi at Barcelona, has no doubt that he will stay with the club

'As he put it, he's at Barca, but doesn't know what tomorrow brings. That's sport. But yes, I believe he will finish his career at Barcelona and I hope he stays.

'Barca's his home and he has already shown what he can do on the field.'

Despite talk of a crisis at Barcelona, Messi assisted two and scored one as Luis Enrique's side surged to a 3-1 victory over defending champions Atletico Madrid at the Nou Camp on Sunday.
