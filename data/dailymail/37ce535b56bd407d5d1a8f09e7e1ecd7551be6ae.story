Real Housewives of New Jersey star Teresa Giudice and her husband, Giuseppe 'Joe' Giudice have been released on a combined $1million bail after making initial court appearances Tuesday on federal fraud charges.

The couple were ordered to surrender their passports and to confine their travels to New Jersey and New York. Joe Giudice could be deported to Italy if convicted because he is not a U.S. citizen.

Teresa, 41, and her 43-year-old husband had toned down their usual flamboyant look to wear differing shades of slate suit, the reality TV queen even had her famous hair slicked back into a sensible ponytail as she walked into Martin Luther King Jr. courthouse in Newark, New Jersey.

As they walked out of court and a reported peppered the couple with questions about Joe's possible deportation, his mother Filomena stepped in and responded: 'None of your f****** business.'

Joe then slapped away a camera as he walked - even though his lawyer scolded him, 'Don't do that.'

The couple were charged in a 39-count 
indictment Monday with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, bank 
fraud, making false statements on loan applications and bankruptcy 
fraud.

They are accused of exaggerating
their income while applying for loans before their TV show debuted in 
2009, then hiding their fortunes in a bankruptcy filing after their 
first season aired.

Authorities
allege the couple submitted fraudulent mortgage and other loan 
applications from 2001 to 2008, a year before their show debuted on 
Bravo. Prosecutors said the couple submitted fake W-2s, tax returns and 
bank account information to lenders.

Prosecutors
allege the Giudices received about $4.6 million in mortgages, 
withdrawals from home equity lines of credit and construction loans.

Joe
Giudice, an entrepreneur, also failed to file tax returns for the years
2004 through 2008, when he is alleged to have earned nearly $1 million,
prosecutors said. During that time his income allegedly fluctuated 
wildly; the indictment states he made $323,481 in 2005 and $26,194 in 
2006.

Teresa Giudice's 
attorney, Henry Klingeman, said she would plead not guilty. Joe 
Giudice's attorney did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

In a statement, Teresa said she supports her husband and wants to resolve the charges as soon as possible.

'I
am committed to my family and intend to maintain our lives in the best 
way possible, which includes continuing my career,' she said.

In
their 2009 bankruptcy filing, the couple said they were $11 million in 
debt. They stated their monthly take-home pay was $16,583, but $10,000 
was from 'monthly assistance from family members' and Bravo income.

It
also said they owed $2.2 million in mortgages, $13,000 to Neiman Marcus
and Nordstrom and nearly $12,000 to a fertility clinic.

The
most serious charges the couple face, bank fraud and loan application 
fraud, carry a maximum potential penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1 
million fine.

If convicted, they could face a maximum sentence of more 50 years in prison.

Facing jail: The Giudices found fame on The Real Housewives Of New Jersey

Teresa's attorney says she will plead not guilty and that 'we look forward to vindicating her.'

Giudice,
who appeared on Bravo's Watch What Happens Live on Sunday to discuss 
her truce with brother Joe Gorga and sister-in-law Melissa, also issued 
her own statement on Monday saying 'today is a most difficult day for 
our family.'

She explained:
'I support Joe and, as a wonderful husband and father, I know he wants 
only the best for our lovely daughters and me I am committed to my 
family and intend to maintain our lives in the best way possible, which 
includes continuing my career.

'As a result, I am hopeful that we will resolve this matter with the Government as quickly as possible.'

The show is in its fifth season on Bravo. A network spokesman had no comment.
