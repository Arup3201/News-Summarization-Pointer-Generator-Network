Plea deal: Andrew Demers, 74, was indicted  on the severe count of Class A gross sexual assault and Class B unlawful sexual contact

A former police chief  has reached a plea deal with prosecutors on charges of gross sexual assault against a 4-year-old relative.

Andrew Demers, 74, of New Gloucester was the former chief of Maine State Police and had been scheduled to appear in the Cumberland County Courthouse on Tuesday for a hearing.

But Walter McKee his attorney said the hearing was postponed until next month because an agreement had been reached.

A spokeswoman for Cumberland County District Attorney Stephanie Anderson also confirmed  the deal but said a judge still has to approve the terms of the plea agreement. 

Demers' was arrested in March and initially charged with Class B unlawful sexual contact with a person younger than 12.   

In April, the Cumberland County grand jury indicted Demers' on the more severe count of Class A gross sexual assault and Class B unlawful sexual contact, which allegedly  occurred this year. He pleaded not guilty to the charges.  

The alleged abuse had been taking place at Demers' house in New Gloucester for several months, according to the Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce. No other victims have been named. 

Police: Demers' was chief of Maine State Police from 1987 to 1993 and enjoyed a 26-year career until he retired

Demers enjoyed a  26 year career with the state police and served as chief for six years before retiring in 1993.

The married grandfather, reportedly tried to kill himself days before the initial investigation was launched into whether he engaged in unlawful sexual conduct with a child. 

But he later confessed from his intensive care bed  at the Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston, according to the sheriff's office.  

In 2003, Demers became the most decorated officer in state police history and was named a 'Legendary Trooper,' according to a report in the Sun Journal. 

Yet he came under fire in the 1970s when it was alleged that he turned a blind eye to allegations of abuse against several boys by the founder of the Cole Farms Restaurant in Gray, who was a friend.

Restaurateur Warren Cole was charged with sexually molesting a boy from 1986 1987. He was jailed in 1992. 

Demers' could face up to 30 years in prison if he is convicted of gross sexual assault.
