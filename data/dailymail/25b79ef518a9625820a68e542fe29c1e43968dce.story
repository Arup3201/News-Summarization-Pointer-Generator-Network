It's a long way from the sunny beach-loving holiday destination that Balinese tour operators like to project to the thousands of Australians who descend on the island every year.

A 16-minute video was uploaded to YouTube on Wednesday showing various breeds of dogs held to the ground and given a lethal injection by Balinese officers.

The footage shows how dogs 'illegally smuggled' into the country are given a lethal injection before being thrown onto a pile.

This is part of a 'legally endorsed program' by the Governor of Bali and the Bali Agricultural Quarantine to tackle the risk of a rabies plague from the increasing number of stray and smuggled dogs. And in one shot, a female official can be seen smiling and taking photos of an animal just before it is put to its death.

The footage, which shows how innocent pedigree dogs are first held in cages and forced to watch in fear as they await their horrific fate, has been condemned by animal activism group PETA, describing the scene as 'slaughter'.

The YouTube user who uploaded the video says the dogs are killed with an intracardiac injection, also known as a heart stick. This procedure involves sticking a needle into the animals' hearts.

'In Bali frightened smuggled dogs for the black market are held in cages and forced to watch others killed by lethal injection,' he wrote in the video description.

Bali, one of Australia's top holiday destinations, has more than 900,000 Australian visitors each year.

The Bali Times reported that in April about 31 expensive breeds, including a Siberian husky, a Pomeranian and a Lacy, were euthanised. They are worth hundreds of millions of rupiah, equivalent to thousands of Australian dollars. They were smuggled on a bus traveling from Java to Bali.

It was also reported that dogs were captured by authorities when no one claimed ownership after 24 hours.

A petition on Change.org is urging Bali Governor Made Mangku Pastika to eliminate the inhumane culling program

'The sadistic scene involving innocent dogs whose only crime is being homeless and suspected to have "rabies".

'There is no compassion from the killers.

'Thrown into a pile the killers can be heard talking and laughing with no regard to the pain and suffering going on around them. Loving dogs treated as garbage instead of faithful companions who only wanted to be loved.'

The Jakarta Post reported that mass vaccinations have also been held, targeting more than 300,000 dogs each time.

Bali Governor Made Mangku Pastika was quoted saying that any stray dogs should be killed immediately as part of the 2009 rabies prevention bylaw. This was created to prevent people from being bitten by stray rabid dogs.

'If any stray dogs are found, feel free to eliminate them,' Mr Pastika said last month. 'It has been stipulated in the bylaw that dog owners have to confine their pets at home.'

A PETA Australia spokeswoman says they've previously worked with the Bali Animal Welfare Association (BAWA) and the Indonesian government to end the mass culling of dogs.

'PETA strongly condemns the slaughter seen in this video. Dogs are clearly terrified and stressed, no attempt is made to administer lethal injection via IV methods (the only humane form of euthanasia) and there is no reason why these dogs cannot be vaccinated rather than slaughtered.'

'Since 2010, a successful vaccination program and the number of humans becoming infected with rabies has fallen dramatically,' the spokeswoman said.

'It is unclear why the Balinese Governor has decided to revert to a policy of killing all stray dogs in the face of an extremely successful anti-rabies vaccination program and against all specialist advice.

A petition on Change.org is urging Mr Pastika to shut down his elimination programs and suggests more humane ways of controlling increasing numbers.
