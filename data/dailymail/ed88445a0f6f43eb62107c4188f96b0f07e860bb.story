Friends have revealed that Huma Abedin was aware of her
husband's most recent indiscretions months before he decided to run for New
York City mayor.

When 23-year-old Sydney Leathers released sexual messages on
Tuesday that showed Anthony Weiner continued his inappropriate online
relationships well beyond his 2011 resignation from congress, all eyes were
turned to Abedin to see if she knew.

She stood by her man- though looking nervous and
uncomfortable while doing so- and declared that she was aware of his behavior
and they decided a mayoral run was right for the family.

Her friends have now spoken out saying that she was
devastated when she originally learned about his relapse but she has had months
to come to terms with the news.

Show of support: Huma Abedin revealed on Tuesday that she was aware of his indiscretions 'before and after' his resignation and they decided to launch his mayoral campaign

'When she found out, she was furious. She was furious, and
she thought long and hard about leaving, and ultimately decided what was best
for her and her son and her family was to continue to try to work through it,'
unidentified friends told The Wall Street Journal.

Telling her side: Abedin wrote an essay about her love of her husband and family in next month's Harper's Bazaar

They added that it was her decision to 
attend and speak at the press conference on Tuesday, and she did not 
make that choice under any pressure from her husband or his campaign.

She has taken a number of tactical steps during the campaign, as she made a conscious choice to speak to People Magazine alongside Weiner and their son Jordan in June 2012.

She also has been on the campaign trail with him, appearing in his official launch video and attending events at his side.

An essay she wrote about their difficult journey over the past two years is scheduled to appear in next month's issue of Harper's Bazaar, timed so that the publication coincides with the Democratic primary on September 10.

Abedin herself marked the biggest difference between Weiner's two
devastating press conferences- the first when he resigned in 2011 following the
accidental release of a photo of his clothed genitals on his Twitter account,
and then the press conference on Tuesday.

In 2011, a then-pregnant Abedin was lauded for choosing not
to stand next to her disgraced, weepy husband though he said that they decided
to work on their marriage.

But now, following her press conference debut, immediate
comparisons were drawn between she and Silda Spitzer, who served as the
inspiration for CBS's hit show The Good Wife following her decision to stand
next to the former Governor when he admitted to using prostitutes.

Where they started: Huma and Anthony got married in July 2010, less than a year before he resigned

Big signal: She was lauded for not standing next to Weiner when he resigned in 2011, but now her decision to change tact on Tuesday has drawn criticisms

'She's not the "good wife". If she had found out
yesterday she wouldn't have been standing there,' her friends told the Wall
Street Journal.

'She knew it was going to be a long and tough time, and she
knew he hadn't hit rock bottom.'

In her statement on Tuesday, Abedin was clear to mention that they have gone through 'a whole lot of therapy' to get to the point where they are now, and other friends believe she sees his relapse as part of the healing process.

'She’s not fine and she’s not in good spirits. No one‘s fine when they go through this. But the emotional part of this was last fall,' and unidentified confidante told The New York Daily News.

'I assume (she stayed) because he was trying to beat this, and knew that’s part of the process.'

Standing united: Anthony Weiner had his wife Huma Abedin at his side when he addressed the new revelations of another sexually inappropriate relationship that took place a year after he resigned

Aside from her appearance at Tuesday's press conference, Abedin has reverted to her low-profile ways, holing up in the couple's Manhattan apartment on Wednesday with a brief escape when she went into an awaiting car. 

No official 
statements or plans have been released but insiders expect she will keep
 a lower profile moving forward in the campaign.

Her
 decision to stay with Weiner after the first revelations in 2011 was 
largely accepted by the public, under the assumption that he stopped 
communicating other woman and focusing on their marriage.

On the sidelines: Huma Abedin has been working for Hillary Clinton (pictured here in 2012 when she was serving as Secretary of State) since 1996 and is considered one of her top aides

'I tell my friends 
things that Anthony does and they're always like, 'Really? He does 
that?! My husband doesn't do that.' I mean, I have not washed a single 
piece of clothing ever. Anthony does all our laundry. I have not been to
 our dry cleaner. He does that. He makes my tea when I get up in the 
morning. He's just a loving, caring, thoughtful spouse and partner,' she
 told People in late June 2012.

Now
 his messages with Sydney Leather prove that he struck up a new virtual 
romance less than two weeks later, which led to graphic chats, phone sex
 conversations and an exchange of naked pictures of his genitals.

'I
 have no way of knowing whether Huma, for whom I have great respect, is 
responding out of new motherhood, the Stockholm syndrome or a mystery,' 
women's rights activist Gloria Steinem told The New York Times.

A
 number of commentators have linked her behavior- or her 'Post Scandal 
Playbook'- come straight from the pages of her mentor and longtime boss 
Hillary Clinton. Abedin is the former Secretary of States' top aide and 
has worked with her since 1996 when she was First Lady.

Though
 the Clintons have said from the beginning of the mayoral race that they
 will not be endorsing any candidate- citing their close ties to many 
from when Mrs Clinton was the Senator of New York- Abedin has used her 
connections to help bring in big money donors for her husband.

'Her
 loyalty is to Hillary Clinton and her role model is Hillary Clinton. 
Doormats. Doormats with the promise of a payoff later down the road,' 
conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh said.

The criticism is not only coming from the right, though the Democrats are tending to focus on Weiner rather than Abedin.

Minority leader Nancy Pelosi, who was one of the most vocal voices calling for Weiner's resignation in 2011, today told NBC's Luke Russert that his recent conduct is 'reprehensible, disrespectful of women'.

Congressman Charles Rangel, who has been the Democratic representative for Harlem for over 40 years, echoed those sentiments on MSNBC Wednesday morning.

'Nobody that I know understands at all what Anthony Weiner was thinking about. And right now, I think you would agree that we all are concerned about his wife. She's a brave lady,' Congressman Rangel told MSNBC on Wednesday.

'I have seen a lot of things like this in politics where males have to lean on their wives for support, but I don't ever recall seeing a wife looking and feeling so sad and embarrassed, because Huma is a very private person, a very delicate, sophisticated person. And all the years that I've known her, putting her into this political situation, as bright and as intelligent as she is, is very awkward.'
