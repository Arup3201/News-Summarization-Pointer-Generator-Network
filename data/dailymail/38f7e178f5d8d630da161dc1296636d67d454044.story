Bob Lodwidge has suffered from severe toothache since dental treatment to remove a tooth

A routine trip to the dentist has ruined a father's life after it left him with a condition which makes it too painful to talk or eat.

Bob Lodwidge has suffered excruciating toothache for more than a year and is now five-stone lighter as he cannot bear to eat.

The furniture store owner claims his life has been ruined after a routine tooth removal left him in unrelenting agony despite taking 25 painkillers daily.

Following surgery the father-of-two, 
52, of Winchester, Hampshire, was diagnosed with left-sided trigeminal 
neuralgia.

This condition causes shooting pains through his face constantly, 
leaving it too painful to talk or eat.

His condition has also made it impossible to work and run his new furniture shop.

Mr Lodwidge said: 'Before this I was a
happy, outgoing, larger than life character but now I'm depressed in 
constant pain so can't talk and I have lost all my confidence.

'I feel I am half the man I used to be and it is heart-breaking to see the affect it is having on my family.'

As a result of his toothache Mr Lodgwidge sleeps 15 hours a day and his diet is limited to porridge and yoghurts.

His condition - considered to be one 
of the most painful known to man - has also affected his marriage to 
wife of 32 years wife Rose-Marie.

Rose-Marie, 50, said: 'He's not the man I married; he has no quality of life at all.

'We don't get to spend any time together, and I know our children and granddaughter Sian are desperate to spend time with him too. It's horrible to see him like this.'

Trigeminal Neuralgia is an extremely severe facial pain that has unpredictable sudden shock-like attacks. 

The pain can be triggered by light touches, and is described as stabbing, shooting, excruciating or burning.

It usually lasts for a few seconds but there can be many bursts of pain in quick succession.

One theory is that it is caused by the trigeminal nerve wrongly sending out inappropriate pain signals.

Trigeminal neuralgia is a long-term condition that often gets worse over time.

It is normally treated with surgery or painkillers.

After numerous trips to his GP and 
Southampton General Hospital Mr Lodwidge has been given various 
medications to try and ease the pain but as of yet nothing has worked.

His daily dose of drugs includes oral morphine.

The father, who now has a phobia of dentists added: 'Doctors have suggested alternative painkillers and a balloon compression.

'This involves inflating a balloon over the trigeminal nerve to relieve pressure but I think surgery is the only viable option.

'It is just running my life. I really do hope that this nightmare will be over soon so my family and I can get back to our happy life.'

A spokesman from Southampton General Hospital added: 'Mr Lodwidge has a rare and painful complaint.

'He is now under the care of our neurosurgery team as we look to help find a safe, appropriate and effective solution for him.'
