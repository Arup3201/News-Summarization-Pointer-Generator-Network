The BBC has lavished  more than £10million on consultants in the past year.

Its total consultancy bill doubled in just 12 months as executives spent thousands of pounds on personal ‘advisers’ from firms such as Deloitte, Accenture and KPMG.

But despite awarding hundreds of contracts - at huge expense to licence fee payers - the corporation refused to provide any details of what they were hired to do.

'Not an easy ride': Director-general Tony Hall promised to tighten spending on consultants just last month - but the cost to the BBC has increased

Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act show the BBC paid a total of £10.4million to external consultants in the financial year up to March.

The bill in 2011/12 was £5million.

The five biggest recipients were Accenture, Deloitte, KPMG, PriceWaterhouseCoopers and McKinsey.

Only last month director-general Tony Hall promised to reduce spending on consultants. He told the Commons culture, media and sport committee: ‘I want to reduce the amount of money that we pay on consultants, I really do. I am not an easy ride when it comes to consultants.’

But the BBC is already on course to rack up another huge bill this financial year, spending £4.7million in the six months between April, when Lord Hall took up his role, and September.

Last night Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, threatened to drag Lord Hall to the House to explain the enormous bill in person.

She said: ‘This is public money. You’ve got to account for it properly. They better have a jolly good explanation for why they need so much consultancy in an organisation that is slimming down on management anyway.

‘They have to say what the consultants were hired to do. They can’t carry on with this secrecy.’

In the past two years, 22 divisions of the corporation – including the BBC Trust, the human resources department and the finance team – have employed the help of management consultants.

The corporation refused to release details of what projects any of the consultancy firms were hired for, or how much each was paid.

Deloitte alone earned £5.7million in BBC fees between January and August this year, it emerged yesterday.

It is thought much of the recent increase in consultancy fees has been driven by senior executives hiring external advisers to help them do their jobs rather than rely on the BBC’s own staff.

It is believed the BBC’s £300,000-a-year director of operations,  Dominic Coles, employs a Deloitte consultant as his ‘chief adviser’.

In September, the BBC’s £295,000-a-year strategy chief James Purnell was criticised for recruiting former Labour spin chief Godric Smith to provide PR advice.

The BBC already had 140 staff in its PR department with a salary bill of around £5million.

Tory MP Conor Burns, who sits on the culture, media and sport select committee, said the consultancies’ bill was a ‘staggering waste of money’.

He added: ‘It is an extraordinary, unnecessary bill. We have a new director-general appointed with a clear mandate to draw a line under the past and get a grip.

‘He has recruited a team of hand-picked managers who he says are the best people to sort out the BBC’s problems, and they are paid hundreds of thousands of pounds a year.

‘Why, if this phalanx of managers are so good, can’t they do their jobs without the help of external consultants?’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC in common with other large organisations does employ consultants when we need specialist advice and guidance on projects that are outside of the normal course of our business and where it would not be cost-efficient to maintain these specialist skills in-house.
