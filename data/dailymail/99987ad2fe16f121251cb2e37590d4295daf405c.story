Amanda Spencer threatened to kill a ten-year-old alleged victim of child prostitution if she didn't do as she was told, a court has heard

A baby faced female 'pimp' threatened to kill a ten-year-old alleged victim of child prostitution if she didn’t do as she was told, a court has heard.

The girl, now 18, said she was just 10 or 11 when she met Amanda Spencer on the streets of Sheffield, South Yorkshire.

Spencer, 22, is accused of luring nine young girls into prostitution after first plying them with drink and drugs.

In a DVD played to Sheffield Crown Court, the girl said Spencer would invite her, along with other girls to homes around Sheffield, and get them intoxicated.

Then, she said, Spencer would invite men to the properties, who would take advantage of the children.

The court heard that on most occasions, the victims would get little or none of the money paid to Spencer for the sexual favours.

The victim said: 'She would get us drunk, give us weed and then she would literally walk out of the room.

'The men would try it on, I would say no, but they would do what they wanted anyway. I don’t know how old [the men] thought I was but you could tell I was a baby.'

She added: 'Amanda told me she would kill me if I told people what was happening.

'Intimidated and scared - that’s the way I felt.'

Spencer is on trial alongside five men - Lee Unwin, 27, John McLachlan, 66, Kareem Ahmed, 30, Bashdar Hamadamin, 27, and a 68-year-old man who cannot be named for legal reasons.

They are all accused of child sex offences.

Sheffield Crown Court heard Spencer was 16 or 17-years-old when she first met the girl at the city’s Castle Market - and the girl was only 10 or 11.

The woman would call the girls - some of whom were as young as 12 - her sisters or cousins, it is alleged

Spencer denies 28 offences relating to the prostitution of eight children and is jointly charged of trafficking a ninth victim within the UK

'You could tell I was a kid,' said the witness.

She said Spencer was 'dead nice' when they first met - but soon changed from friendly to controlling.

'She
 started shouting at me, telling me what to do, what to wear and things 
like that. She would put my make-up on to make me look older.

'I used to have to tell people I was 16.'

The girl said one day Spencer took her on the 120 bus to see a man Spencer called 'uncle'.

The prosecution allege 'uncle' is the 68-year-old man who cannot be identified.

The teenager said that, while at his home, the man grabbed hold of her and touched her indecently.

She said Spencer meanwhile was sitting on the sofa making 'funny eyes' at her.

'I was just about to find out what she was like,' said the witness.

Asked what she meant, she said: 'That she wasn’t the nice girl I thought she was, and I felt scared of her.'

She added: 'I thought she would stand up for me and say to him, "don’t touch her" - but she didn’t.'

Spencer, of Canklow, Rotherham, denies 38 offences.

Unwin,
 of Nether Green, Sheffield, denies paying for the sexual services of a 
child, while McLachlan, of Firth Park, Sheffield, denies two counts of 
paying for the sexual services of a child.

Ahmed, of Manor, Sheffield, denies trafficking for sexual exploitation, and Hamadamin, of Burngreave, Sheffield, denies rape.

The 68-year-old man denies three counts of sexual assault.

The trial continues.
