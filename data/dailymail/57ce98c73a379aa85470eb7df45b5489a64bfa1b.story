A young Connecticut mom with a previous conviction for prostitution has been arrested for allegedly leaving her newborn baby in a car in the freezing cold wearing only a onesie, while she shopped in a sex store with a male friend.

Police say that Lindsay Hoffmann, 26, and her acquaintance, Marquette Riggsbee, 54, walked into an adult emporium in Southington called VIP on Wednesday morning.

However they were stopped at the door and told that children were not permitted.

Hoffmann then allegedly put her two-week-old son in the car. The temperature outside was 29 degrees.

Busted: Lindsay Hoffmann, 26, and her acquaintance, Marquette Riggsbee, 54 - who both have previous prostituion-related arrests - allegedly left her two-week-old son in the car to shop in a Connecticut adult store

Police received a call to the store at 11am after a worker noticed the little boy inside the 1997 Nissan Sentra.

They believe he had been in the vehicle for over 20 minutes.

The baby’s core temperature was 'found to be adequate but it did have cold extremities', police said, according to The Smoking Gun.

'He was not dressed for winter,' VIP District Manager Tina Marchese told WFSB.

'He was just in a normal onesie - no hat, hands exposed.

'It really affected us because we are all mothers so it was a really sad thing for the baby.' 

The child was taken to hospital for an evaluation but was deemed to be fine.

He has been taken into custody by the Department of Children and Families.

Hoffmann and Riggsbee were each charged with risk of injury to a minor and leaving a child unsupervised.

They were remanded in jail in lieu of $25,000 bail.  

Scene: Hoffman allegedly left her baby son in this carpark - with the outside temperature sitting at 29 degrees - while she shopped at the store, VIP in Southington, Connecticut 

Hoffmann, of Waterbury, is scheduled to appear in court Thursday.

She has 2013 convictions for prostitution and failure to appear in court, according to The New York Daily News.

She was found guilty in December of driving with a suspended driver’s license, online court records show.

Riggsbee faces pending charges for trafficking in persons, coercion, promoting prostitution and unlawful restraint.

He was convicted of resisting arrest in 2013.
