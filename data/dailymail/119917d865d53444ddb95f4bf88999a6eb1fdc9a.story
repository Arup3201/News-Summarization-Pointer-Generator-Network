Two weeks ago, the name Zeddie Little meant nothing to the average American but thanks to the power of the Internet, today he appeared to the nation on morning TV as 'Ridiculously Photogenic Guy'.

The 25-year-old, who goes by his middle name Watkins, was dressed in an open-necked pastel blue shirt with rolled up dark denim jeans and a pair of electric blue sneakers on Good Morning America. He appeared a little bashful about his new-found fame.

Mr Little, originally from Charleston, South Carolina but living in New York, said: 'I find the humor in all of it, it's funny. I feel honored to be part of a joke that's in good spirits because the Internet can be a little vicious.

He added: 'Jokes can get bent the wrong way but 
these are for the most part positive. I guess it's the most flattering 
way to get spread across the Internet.'

Sitting beside Mr Little on the sofa was
the man responsible for his global fame - photographer Will King who 
said he was a self-taught and had only been taking pictures for around a
year and a half.

The two did not know each other prior to the picture which was taken while Mr Little was competing in the 10km Cooper Bridge run in his hometown of Charleston at the end of last month.

Mr Little said: 'It was a fluke to be 
honest. We figured it out...I was running and waving at a friend who was on
the sidelines. I turned around and I caught a camera lens... and that's
history.'

What's up, good looking? Zeddie Little, 25, has become an Internet sensation after an amateur photographer randomly took his photo during a 10K run in Charleston, South Carolina

Mr King added: 'There was tons of 
people but he was looking straight at the camera, smiling, the sun was 
hitting his hair, just flowing in the wind. He's just an all around 
photogenic guy.

Little was accompanied to the GMA set by his girlfriend of five years, 
who remained off camera, breaking the hearts of millions of fans and 
disappointing those who have offered him marriage proposals.

the sidelines. I turned around and I caught a camera lens... and that's
history.

Mr Little also revealed to host Robin 
Roberts that he had signed up yesterday to run this 
year's New York City Marathon for the John Ritter Foundation for Aortic 
Health.

Fans had 
excitedly awaited Mr Little's TV debut, with one tweeting: 'Ridiculously
photogenic guy tomorrow on GMA? Is this real life?'

A Facebook fan page set up in his honor
on Friday now had 58,000 likes. His picture had already been viewed 
more than 1.25 million times on Flickr since being posted on March 31.

His father told MailOnline last week that his son was overwhelmed by all the attention.

He also revealed his son has spent years trying to break into the PR business - only to become famous overnight.

Overnight sensation: Zeddie Little already has 2,327 likes on his Facebook fan page on Friday within an hour of being set up... that has now risen to 58,000

Speaking from his home in Isle of Palms, South Carolina, his father 
Zeddie Little, who goes by the name Jack, said: 'What’s happened is 
crazy. I think it’s phenomenal and it’s been fun to watch because my son
is such a hard-working and unassuming guy.

Not only is the 25-year-old fit, he can cook, has a
college degree and appears to have a bright future ahead of him.

His father said: 'This is totally unexpected and has just happened - he was in the right place at the right time with the right smile.

'He has never done any modelling or anything like that. Right now he’s 
trying to break into the PR business in New York, so this will probably 
help. He’s done a few part-time jobs but has just got something permanent.

Is there anything he can't do? Even with a horse in the background, left, and wearing crocs, right, Zeddie Little still looks ridiculously photogenic as his popularity shows no signs of abating

'He’s a bit overwhelmed by all the attention, he doesn’t know what to do
and when he called me to tell me about it he said: "I can’t believe 
it!"'

According to the Charleston City Paper, Zeddie Little met his girlfriend
in 2007 whilst working at a pizza restaurant in his home town of 
Charleston, South Carolina. The pair moved to New York last spring and 
he worked several restaurant jobs while doing internships.

Last Wednesday, the very day he landed his first permanent job with a 
music PR company in the city, he became famous on the Internet.

Jack Little, 58, who runs an organization providing emergency food and 
clothing to the needy, said: 'My son is in a relationship and he is very
committed to his girlfriend. I’m not sure what she makes of all this 
attention he has been receiving.

'I'm excited for him. Yeah, I mean he's always been very quiet and very 
conscientious and never wanted any attention, and I think he's very much
deserving of it.'

Spoof: The photograph has become an Internet meme with others adding cheeky 
captions to the picture

Run for it: Mr Little, returned to his home state of South Carolina to compete in the 10k Cooper Bridge Run, when he was snapped by a photographer

Power of the Internet: Zeddie Little has become an overnight celebrity after he was randomly photographed looking cheerful and at ease while running a 10k

Amateur photographer Will King took a picture of him with his beaming 
smile and flowing hair, and tagged it on his Flickr account as 
'Ridiculously Photogenic Guy'.

Mr King told local paper the Post and Courier: 'One of my friends 
commented on the picture and said something along the lines of 'I dub 
this guy Mr Ridiculously Photogenic'.

'I thought it was a pretty cool comment, so I posted it on (Internet 
news website) Reddit. For some reason it just took off from there.'

The photograph has become an Internet meme with others adding cheeky 
captions to the picture such as: 'Goes For Run: Inadvertently Teaches 
World How To Spell 'Ridiculously'; and 'Goes for a jog... whole town 
follows him'.

Running joke: Zeddie Little's picture has caused much hilarity as multiple spoofs have sprung up online

On the Facebook fan page one girl had written: ‘lol [sic] he is extremely good looking for a random dude'.

According to the Charleston City Paper Zeddie Little went to West Ashley
High School in the city then attended the College of Charleston.

He graduated in 2009 with a BA in arts in communications but during his 
studies he worked at the EVO Pizzeria in North Charleston.

Ricky Hacker, who owns the restaurant, said that Zeddie Little was the 
first person he gave a job to when he opened in March 2007.

He told the Charleston City Paper: 'He was ambitious. He was a really smart guy. He understood food well and was very interested in it and read a lot on his own.

'He was very interested in other restaurant scenes outside of 
Charleston, and he was really in tune with what was going on in New 
York.'

Mr Hacker added recent events were 'pretty unexpected, obviously'.

He said: 'You know, from Charleston, you live in New York, and you get discovered in Charleston.

'The man was just trying to exercise'.
