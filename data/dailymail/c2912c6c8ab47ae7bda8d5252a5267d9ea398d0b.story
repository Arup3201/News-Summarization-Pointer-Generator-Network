Zlatan Ibrahimovic will be forced to nurse his recent heel injury for the rest of the Ligue 1 season, claims Paris Saint-Germain club doctor Eric Rolland

The Swedish striker has been sidelined for the majority of the 2014-15 campaign with the complaint and has made just 11 appearances for the French club so far.

Ibrahimovic looks set to miss PSG's forthcoming match against Nantes on Saturday in order to be fit enough to face Barcelona in the Champions League next week.

PSG club doctor Eric Rolland believes Zlatan Ibrahimovic will be struggling with a heel injury all season

Club doctor Rolland told RMC Sport: 'He still has pain in his heel. It's pain that can change in intensity.'

'Recently it hasn't got worse but it will be present until the end of the season. Zlatan will not play every game.

'He just wanted to look after himself ahead of the trip to Barcelona.'
