Gary Harkins and Jim McAlister brought an internet viral to life on Saturday, when they celebrated a Dundee goal against Motherwell with their version of a Randy Orton 'RKO'.

Harkins had just scored Dundee's second goal at Fir Pirk, to help end a run of four straight defeats, when he and McAlister brought the move to life.

As Harkins stood with his arms aloft, McAlister pretended to grab him by the head and throw him to the floor in the iconic wrestling slam.

The internet sensation, which has recently been applied to various videos of people falling over, features Orton throwing someone to the ground 'out of nowhere'. 

And the wrestler himself seemed to approve, tweeting 'nice celebration, work on your form' to Dundee's official twitter account. 

Dundee went on to win 3-1, lifting them to seventh in the Scottish Premiership after ten games.
