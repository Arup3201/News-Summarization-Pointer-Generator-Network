Al Arabi manager Dan Petrescu has claimed Barcelona star Xavi has agreed to join his side.

The former Chelsea defender insists the Spain international has already signed a pre-contract agreement with the Qatari club.

According to reports in Romania, the 34-year-old could earn just over £6million a season should the move go through.

Claims: Former Chelsea man Petrescu, pictured during his time with Dinamo Moscow, is managing in Qatar

Speaking to Digisport, the former Romanian international said: 'Xavi signed a pre-contract with Al Arabi. There were probably other offers from other teams.'

The midfielder has spent his entire career with the Catalan giants but it seems his time at the Nou Camp is coming to an end with Al Arabi seemingly in the driving seat to sign him.
