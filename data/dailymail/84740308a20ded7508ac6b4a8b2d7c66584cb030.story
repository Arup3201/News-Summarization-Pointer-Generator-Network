After a lightning-fast summer assault by ISIS that saw most of Iraq fall into their hands, the country's military is now fighting back and has won a string of symbolic victories.

But while Iraq's leaders insist it is their army on the offensive, in reality the victories are being won by a powerful Iranian general - the 'fearless' Ghasem Soleimani.

Refusing to wear a bullet-proof vest on the front lines, and with his motto 'death is the beginning of life, not the end', he has inspired Iraqi troops to victory where the government has failed.

'Fearless': While the Iraqi military has claimed a series of victories against ISIS in recent weeks, sources have attributed them to the Iranian general Ghasem Soleimani (pictured) who is said to be leading attacks

Inspiring: Soleimani (second right) was also said to have lead troops to victory in Amirli and Samarra with his motto 'death is the beginning of life, not the end' 

As ISIS militants retreated from the town of Jurf al-Sakher last week, relinquishing their hold for the first time since August, Soleimani was credited with the victory, according to military sources.

Militia commanders said that dozens of advisers from Hezbollah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard were on the front lines in Jurf al-Sakher. 

They said the men provided weapons training to some 7,000 Iraqi troops and militia fighters and coordinated with military commanders ahead of the operation.

One commander, who agreed to be identified only by his nickname, Abu Zeinab, said Soleimani began planning the Jurf al-Sakher operation three months ago.   

In Amirli in August and in Samarra in June, top officials say Soleimani was on hand, pacing along with the Iraqi troops, and using his tactical abilities to drive the Islamic State militants back into the desert. 

A top Kurdish official even suggested that Soleimani and his crack Quds Revolutionary Guard force were on hand to help them defend their capital city Irbil from waves of ISIS fighters this summer.

Iraqi military officials declined to discuss Soleimani's presence in Jurf al-Sakher, or in previous victories where he is known to have played a commanding role. 

There have also been reports that, fighting alongside Soleimani, troops from the Lebanese branch of Hezbollah have also been involved.

Powerful Shiite militias have also sided with Soleimani and Hezbollah and have helped to drive Islamic State away from the so-called Baghdad belt - a ring of villages surrounding the Iraqi capital.

Shiite forces: Fighting alongside Soleimani are said to be troops from Iran-back Hezbollah, and powerful Shiite militias, causing concern among the Sunni locals 

This will come as good news to the Iraqi Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, and the West, as they seek to rebuild Iraq's shattered army and build up their own national guard forces to strike against ISIS.

However, the presence of strong Shiite forces - including Soleimani and Hezbollah - in the mostly Sunni villages around Baghdad is causing concern.

There are fears of atrocities against the natives if the situation is not properly controlled, sparking a new wave of violence across the country.

The Shiite militias have long been implicated in brutality against Sunnis, and their advance could also undermine efforts to knit the troubled country together.

Their members were widely implicated in atrocities across the bloody years of 2006 and 2007, and have been accused of violence against Sunni captives in more recent times.

While Iran-backed Hezbollah are openly fighting with Bashar al-Assad in Syria, the organisation will oonly admit to having 'advisers' in Iraq, breeding suspicion as to their intentions.

In July, officials in Lebanon said a Hezbollah commander was killed while on a 'jihadi mission' in Iraq. 

Ibrahim Mohammed al-Haj was buried in Lebanon and his funeral attended by top Hezbollah officials. It was the first known Hezbollah death in Iraq since the lightning IS advance in June.

A Lebanese official close to the group said Hezbollah is known to have 'a limited number of advisers' in Iraq who are not directly involved in fighting, and that al-Haj was one of them.

Bloodshed: Shiite troops have long been implicated in violence against Sunni villagers, and have been accused of abducting and killing civilians in recent months as the Iraqi government watched on 

Iraqi officials have also said that a handful of advisers from Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, are offering front-line guidance to Iraqi Shiite militias fighting Sunni extremists north of Baghdad. But it is not known if any Hezbollah men are actually fighting.

These forces have benefited from Western airstrikes aimed at weakening ISIS forces on the ground.

With Iraq's military still licking its wounds from a summer of heavy defeats, many fear this has created a power vacuum for the Shiite forces to move into.

Amnesty International said last month that militias have abducted and killed scores of Sunni civilians with the tacit support of the Iraqi government in retaliation for Islamic State attacks.

Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has pledged to reign in the militias and establish a national guard to mobilize Sunnis against the extremists. 

But it could take months to assemble such a force, and in the meantime Soleimani's militias are the best placed to aid Iraq's beleaguered military in regaining the initiative against the Islamic State group.

Iran and Iraq both have a majority Shiite population - though Sunnis are more widely spread in Iraq - and have a troubled history.

Under the leadership of Saddam Hussein Iraq went to war with Iran in wake of the Iranian revolution in 1979. The bloody conflict lasted eight years, included the use of chemical weapons, and ended in a stalemate.
