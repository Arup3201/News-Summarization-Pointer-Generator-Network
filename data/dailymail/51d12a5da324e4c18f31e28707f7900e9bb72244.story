A porn addict who murdered his mother-in-law in a horrific sex attack that shocked an Old Bailey judge is facing life in jail.

Mohammud Yusuf, 32, inflicted 'the most agonising death imaginable' on Amoe Stevens, 64, while his two young sons sat in the next room listening to their grandmother's cries.

Yusuf - who had an obsession with violent pornography - carried out the sex attack on Mrs Stevens before leaving her to bleed to death at her home in Neasden, north west London.

It was only when a carer found Mrs Stevens slumped in her chair that she was rushed to hospital, where she later died.

Yusuf, also from Neasden, denied murdering Mrs Stevens but was was unanimously convicted of the charge after a trial at the Old Bailey.

When the verdict was announced, Margaret Stevens, Yusuf's wife, wept so hard that she had to be comforted by the Old Bailey matron.

The case also visibly shocked the judge, Nicholas Browne QC, who told the jury: ‘This lady suffered the most agonising death imaginable.

‘I have never come across such a factual background of a case like this.'

During the trial, the court heard police were called by the carer found Mrs Stevens at around 8pm in October last year.

Examination of Yusuf’s phone later revealed searches for pornographic videos showing violent rape, gang rape and incest.

Prosecutor David Jeremy QC told the jury that there was a link between this interest and the injuries suffered by Mrs Stevens.

Yusuf pleaded not guilty to murder, but was found guilty after a trial at the Old Bailey, London. He now faces life imprisonment when he is sentenced on Friday

He said: ‘Why this defendant or anyone would have inflicted injuries like these on their defenceless mother-in-law is not a question to which the prosecution can provide you with a complete or satisfactory answer.

‘But clues may be found in the contents of his phone and computers.

‘When you put alongside each other what must be a clearly deviant interest this defendant had in pain and degradation of women and what happened to Mrs Stevens, there is a relationship between them.

‘The effect of that is that it makes it more likely that it was this defendant who would have carried out that assault.’

Both Yusuf’s sons gave evidence to the jury. The court heard both are suffering emotional problems as a result of the case and one has resorted to self-harm.

Mrs Stevens said in a victim impact statement that the case had devastated the family.

Summarising the statement, Mr Jeremy said: ‘She describes her mother as a soft-spoken, hard-workingm loving person who was the peacemaker in any disputes.

‘She describes herself as being overwhelmed having lost her mother and her children having lost their father.

‘They are struck most of all by the complete lack of remorse that the defendant has show towards her mother, herself, her family and his two sons by defending himself.

‘He has made the experience even more agonising by refusing to face up to what he did.’

Yusuf will be sentenced on Friday. The judge warned he could face life imprisonment for the crime.
