David Cameron and Nick Clegg are to leave the country on holiday at the same time this summer – despite having six weeks to ensure one of them stays in charge of the country.

MPs begin their long summer break next Thursday and are not due back in Westminster until the beginning of September.

But Mr Clegg today revealed he had been unable to co-ordinate his family holiday so it did not clash with the Camerons’, and other ministers will be left to ‘hold the fort’.

The Prime Minister and his deputy faced criticism last year after they both jetted off at the same time.

Questions were raised about the point of Mr Clegg was if he did not deputise in the Prime Minister’s absence.

However, Deputy PM has admitted the Cleggs and Camerons have again failed to ensure that one of them remains in Westminster during the six-week recess.

It will not be the first foreign holiday this year for either man - Mr Clegg enjoyed a ski break in the exclusive Davos resort in Switzerland in April while Mr Cameron went to Ibiza with his wife Samantha in June.

Speaking on his weekly radio phone-in, Mr Clegg said: ‘The Prime Minister and I, we try where we can. We’re pragmatic about these things to make sure that as much as possible, we don’t go away at the same time but there’s not always a perfect match.’

He revealed there would be a ‘short period of time where both the Prime Minister and I are away’ this summer. ‘We’re sort of trying to hand over the baton to each other,’ he added.

With the two most senior members of 
the coalition out of the country, Foreign Secretary William Hague and 
Theresa May will be left to ‘hold the fort’.

Mr
Clegg said: We’ve got other senior members of the government: William 
Hague, Foreign Secretary, the Home Secretary and others who in those 
periods of time where either the Prime Minister or I are away; both of 
us for either official reasons or during the recess, they can also hold 
the fort. ‘

After being criticised by a caller to his LBC 97.3 show, Mr Clegg insisted: ‘That’s in a sense the approach which we’ve taken, which I hope most people will accept is a sensible and pragmatic way of dealing with this.’

The caller, Diane, said: ‘As Deputy Prime Minister, that’s exactly what you should do. You should deputise in the absence of the Prime Minister.

‘There is a minimum of six weeks children’s summer holidays and if your children go to certain privileged schools, they will have eight to nine weeks.

‘Surely it could be arranged for either the Prime Minister or you as Deputy Prime Minister to remain in the country.

'When I was working, I certainly could not take the same holidays as my counterpart under any circumstances.’

Every year Mr Clegg and his family go to the same village in Spain where his wife Miriaim’s family is from. They will be accompanied by their three children Antonio, Alberto and Miguel.
