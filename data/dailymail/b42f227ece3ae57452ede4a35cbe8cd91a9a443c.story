When they first played one another seven years ago Rory McIlroy was left fuming at Billy Horschel’s behaviour. On Sunday afternoon they will fight it out for the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup….and the tidy sum of $11.44 million.

The pair are tied at the top after McIlroy shot 67 – his 25th score under par out of his last 27 rounds - and Horschel a 69. For the former, there’s the chance to add yet more lustre to a season that has already seen him claim two majors plus two other prestigious events. For the latter, he has the opportunity to win for the second week in a row. If either wins the event with its $1.44 million first prize, they will also take home the $10 million FedEx bonus.

As the curtain comes down on the PGA Tour season on Sunday, it might not be just about this pair. Justin Rose, Rickie Fowler, Jason Day or the ever-consistent Jim Furyk might have might have something to say about that. Furyk starts two off the pace, with the other trio a further shot adrift.

But if either McIlroy or Horschel remain in the top two one of them will win the FedEx bonus, regardless of the efforts of the others, because of their higher ranking going into the event, following the first three FedEx play-off tournaments.

Back in 2007 it was all about pride at the Walker Cup, where McIlroy felt Horschel went too far in playing the role of the ugly American. ‘Loud and obnoxious’ was his verdict.

Happily the pair have now settled their differences. ‘We were very young at the Walker Cup,’ said 27 year old Horschel. ‘At 20 you’re going to do things you’re going to regret.’

They’ve not done too much to regret in the interim, of course. The pair began this event as the two hottest players in the world – and have gone out and shown it. 

Out in the last group as well on Saturday, they fought a tense battle, with Horschel’s brilliant putting stroke keeping him in the race. He has now gone more than 150 holes since his last three putt – and hasn’t missed one inside 6ft for two events. As for McIlroy, he shrugged aside a slow start to the back nine with a wonderful eagle three at the 15th, where he rolled in a 30ft putt.

McIlroy versus Horschel would be a brilliant dress rehearsal for the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles but for the fact the latter isn’t part of the American team. Neither is Chris Kirk, the other young American who currently leads the FedEx race but who has left himself a mountain to climb today after slipping four off the pace.

American Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson underlined his exasperation with a text to Horschel on Friday:’Why didn’t you play like this earlier?’ But leaving Kirk behind is all his own fault. He took on McIlroy over the final 36 holes in Boston a fortnight ago and beat him – just 24 hours before the wild cards were announced. The timing looked perfect – except Watson went for Webb Simpson.

As he has been doing all week, Simpson continued to trawl the bottom of the field, coming in with a 72 to be placed 27th in the 29 man field. Playing alongside him, fellow wild card pick Hunter Mahan beat him by one to be tied 25th. As one frustrated American wittily put it: ’They worked on their worse ball strategy for Gleneagles.’

Rose has fought back wonderfully following a first round 72 with back-to-back rounds of 66. Even if he won the event it would be unlikely he would win the $10 million as well, but with $3 million going to the man who finishes second in the FedEx and anyone in the top five claiming a seven-figure sum, he has set himself up for a massive payday on Sunday.
