Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has denied any interest in signing AC Milan and Italy striker Mario Balotelli.

Wenger has been linked to the forward repeatedly this summer as The Gunners look to bolster their attacking options.

But the Arsenal boss said the story was 'not true' and that Arsenal were not seeking to purchase the 23-year-old.

Wenger, appearing on beIN Sport's World Cup show, was asked by Ruud Gullit if he was buying the former Manchester City striker, but responded: 'No. No, that’s pure invention.

'We cannot believe absolutely everything that is on internet or is in newspapers.

'Sometimes it’s created by agents or by press who needs news. But in that case, it’s not true.'

Milan are thought to be keen to offload Balotelli as they seek to reduce their wage bill after a disappointing season, while Arsenal are interested in adding strikers to a squad that has just Olivier Giroud and Yaya Sanogo in that position.

Wenger also sold the club's buy-back clause on Carlos Vela to Real Sociedad for £12m, further limiting Arsenal's striking options. 

Costa Rica's Joel Campbell, who has been on loan at Olympiakos, is expected to return to the club this season after an excellent World Cup.

Last summer The  Gunners made bids for Luis Suarez and Gonzalo Higuain but failed to sign either player.
