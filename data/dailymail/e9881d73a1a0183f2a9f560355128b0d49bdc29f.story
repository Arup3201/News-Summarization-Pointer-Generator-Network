Michelle and Jim Bob Duggar, parents to 19 children already, have visited a fertility doctor in a bid to see whether they are 'ready' for another baby. 

'We would love more children if God saw fit to give us more, I just want to make sure that I am ready to catch a baby if that would happen', explains Mrs Duggar, 47, star of 19 Kids and Counting, in a clip on Today.com from tonight's episode of the TLC show.

'My goal is to find out where I am in my life, hormonally speaking,' she says of visiting Dr Paul Wendel, an OB-GYN specializing in high-risk pregnancies.

The couple from Tontitown, Arkansas, who 
will mark their 30th wedding anniversary this July, had their first 
child, Josh, in 1988 and their last, Josie, in 2009.

'If I am in that season of life where if we're not able to have any more, then I'm fine, I'm happy with that', Mrs Duggar insists, as Dr Wendel informs her that her chances of conceiving 'naturally' aged 47 are less than five per cent, and that her risk of a baby with down syndrome is 'one in four or five.'

Mrs Duggar points out that she has been dodging these odds for over a decade already.

The long-married couple are parents to nine daughters and ten boys ranging from three to 26 years old and three grandchildren - Michael, Marcus and Mackynzie - from their eldest son, Joshua, 26, who married Anna in September 2008.

Their youngest child, Josie, four, was born severely prematurely at 25 weeks and four days.

It's not the first time Mrs Duggar - who recently revealed she spends an average of $3,000 a month on groceries to feed her brood - has talked about wanting to be a mother again.

Last fall she told, told Celebrity Baby Scoop that she and Mr Duggar were actively trying for another child after she tragically miscarried a girl, whom they named Jubilee Shalom, in December 2011.

'I would be so grateful if the Lord blessed us with another one,' she said, adding that she always rejoices when she experiences morning sickness because she knows 'things are going along okay'.

She says that although being a parent 
'is a lot of responsibility', there is 'so much joy' having a 'little 
one [become] a part of your family and a part of life.

TV hit: The Duggars first entered the spotlight on the TLC network show 17 and Counting - a series which followed the life of Michelle and Jim Bob and their then 17 (now 19) children

'In all my pregnancies... I knew it was a good sign and a good reason to be sick.' 

While many worry about the health effects of multiple pregnancies, the full-time mother says she feels 'great'.

'We would love more children if God saw fit to give us more'

'I think that exercising and eating right definitely makes a difference. My health is good and I am grateful for that.

'I think it could be different; every person struggles with different things, but I am... able to enjoy running and chasing my little ones around at this point in my life.'

Along with her health, Mrs Duggar says that her marriage is also stronger than ever - which she puts down to good communication and the power of forgiveness.

With such a big brood, she also notes the importance of finding time for each other.

'Oftentimes, Jim Bob plans a date for us once a week, usually on Saturday. Our dates are a really special time for us.'

The Duggars first entered the spotlight in 2008 on TLC's show 17 and Counting - a series which followed the life of Michelle and Jim Bob and their then 17  - now 19 - children.

The family is conservative Christian and has strong beliefs about issues such as contraception, home-schooling, and spending very little time on the internet or watching TV.

They are considered representative of the Quiverfull movement which 'teaches that children are God’s blessing and that husbands and wives should happily welcome every child they are given.'

Addressing their critics, Mr Duggar once said: 'People think we are overpopulating the world [but] we are following our convictions.'
