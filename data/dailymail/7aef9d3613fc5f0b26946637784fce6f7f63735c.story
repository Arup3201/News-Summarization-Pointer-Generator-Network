The last of the living Medal of Honor recipients that stormed Omaha Beach on D-Day in the battle immortalized in 'Saving Private Ryan' has died.

Staff Sergeant Walter Ehlers, 92, of Buena Park, CA., earned the nation’s highest honor and multiple other medals for his heroic actions during the taking of the small sliver of French beach from German soldiers.

He also received three purple hearts and a silver star, according to NBC News.

Ehlers was awarded the Medal of Honor ‘for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty’ on June 9 and 10, 1944, according to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society.

He ‘repeatedly led his men against heavily defended enemy strong points exposing himself to deadly hostile fire whenever the situation required heroic and courageous leadership.’

Ehlers heroically defended his unit from ‘withering machine gun fire’ and mortars, personally killing at least seven Nazi soldiers, taking out multiple enemy positions and even carrying a wounded soldier back across enemy lines to safety despite being shot in the back himself.

He then went back through the hail of bullets to retrieve a US Army-issued automatic rifle which he had to previously leave behind to carry the rifleman to safety.

Ehlers refused to leave his unit after being treated for his bullet wound upon returning and continued to lead his squad deeper into France.

When asked if the ‘Saving Private Ryan’ depiction of US soldiers storming Omaha Beach was as bad as he saw, Ehlers said being there ‘was worse,’ according to the Orange County Breeze.

‘The Germans didn't leave much of me untouched,’ Ehlers said an interview with WWII Magazine in 2012, according to NBC.

His post-war life saw him become a stern advocate for veteran’s benefits and work as a security guard at Disneyland, in Anaheim, from the day it opened, NBC noted.

He also has a local community center named after him and had a postage stamp issued in his honor.

One of the ‘Greatest Generation,’ Ehlers is survived by his wife Dorothy, three children, 11 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
