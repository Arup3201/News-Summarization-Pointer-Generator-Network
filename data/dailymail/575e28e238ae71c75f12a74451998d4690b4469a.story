A homosexual, devout Mormon who is married to a woman and has three children has outed himself via a blog post.

Josh Weed from Auburn, Washington, wrote a detailed post last Thursday on The Weed, his blog, which explored his life as a closeted gay man.

Although Lolly Weed, his wife, knew of his secret for some years prior to their marriage, the post revealed his sexuality to many of the couple's friends and family for the first time.

The post, which aims to answer questions that he and his wife preempt those close to them will have, goes into detail about Mr Weed's love for his wife and their sexual relationship.

'Lolly and I have an extremely healthy and robust sex life,' he wrote last week, as the couple were celebrating their ten year anniversary.

Mr Weed, a family and marriage specialist, has never had sex with a man but claimed he is certainly homosexual and not bisexual.

He wrote: 'Some might assume that because I'm married to a woman, I must be bisexual. Sexual orientation is defined by attraction, not by experience. In my case, I am attracted sexually to men. Period. I've never been turned on by a Victoria's Secret commercial in my entire life.'

The blog post, which is in part written by Lolly, explores everything from when Mr Weed discovered he was gay - he was '11 or 12' - to why he wants to 'grow old' with his wife.

He added that despite his love and attraction to his wife, he is gay and will never become a bisexual.

'I have many, many years of experience which confirm this to be true, but it’s really as simple as what a girl asked me in junior high,' he wrote. '"If everyone in this room took off their clothes, would you be turned on by the girls or the guys?” My answer, which I didn't say out loud, was unquestionably the guys.'

Mr Weed told his wife that he was gay when the couple went on their first date; Mr Weed was just 16.

'We have an extremely healthy and robust sex life... [but] I've never been turned on by a Victoria's Secret commercial in my entire life'

He assured his readers early in the post that his words were 'written from the standpoint of a devout, believing Mormon'.

He admitted that he was forced to reveal his secret after he began sharing personal information with his work clients.

'My clinical work as a therapist is taking me in the direction of helping clients who struggle to reconcile their sexual orientation with their religious beliefs,' he wrote. 'I have decided to be open with these clients about my own homosexuality, and in doing so have opened the door to people finding out about this in ways I can’t control.'

Mrs Weed revealed that the pair met as 'small children' living on the same street in Utah.

She wrote in one of the blog's most moving paragraphs: 'I knew that I loved Josh... I wanted to marry Josh Weed because I loved the man that he was. I loved everything that made him him. I didn’t want anyone else. I knew that we had the kind of relationship that could work through hard trials and circumstances. I did not choose to marry someone who is gay. I have never regretted it.'
