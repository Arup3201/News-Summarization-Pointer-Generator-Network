A mother who drove six children, including two of her own, to a residence just outside New Orleans so they could fight another group of juveniles, resulting in one child being shot, has been arrested.

Police say 35-year-old Lakenya Hall, of Kenner, drove the children to a fight just after 5pm Wednesday after a previous fight at a bus stop. 

It was at that second location that a 14-year-old was shot in the upper thigh. 

He was treated at an area hospital and later released.

Hall was booked on six counts of contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile and disturbing the peace. 

She remains in custody.

A 15-year-old was also booked for aggravated battery and illegal possession of a handgun among other charges.

Hall's two sons, ages 15 and 11, were arrested on charges of disturbing the peace by fighting.

Authorities are still not certain what the fight was about, and more arrests are expected as police have been told there is a video of the fight.
