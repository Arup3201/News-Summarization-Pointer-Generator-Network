One look at Rory McIlroy told you that a life of splendour and a world of riches is still no protection from the turmoil caused by affairs of the heart.

Here was Rory with all the  privileges stripped away, just another 25-year-old struggling like so many with true love and all that it means.

During his short press conference at Wentworth on Wednesday, he answered one question with the distant look of a man with his mind placed firmly somewhere else. There was one awful moment  during another when he looked like he might lose it completely.

In the balance: Rory McIlroy's split from fiancee Caroline Wozniacki has threatened his chances in the PGA Championship

Happy couple: McIlroy proposed to tennis player Wozniacki in December

Going steady: The pair had been an item for over two years

Down: The pair (pictured last week) only sent out invitations to their wedding at the weekend

This was McIlroy as we have not seen 
him, wrought and strung-out. A man who did not appear in any fit mental 
state to make a decent fist of playing in the European Tour’s flagship 
event, the BMW PGA Championship which, lest we forget, begins on Thursday.

Who
 knows the reason for the break-up, which comes only a few days after 
the wedding invitations were sent out. Less than a month ago, Caroline 
Wozniacki was talking of starting a family and McIlroy was tweeting a 
photo of their scenic location for dinner only last Friday.

Let us hope there really is nothing more to it than the official explanation of cold feet.

But the news certainly caught everyone cold on the practice ground. ‘I’m surprised, I think we all must be,’ said Luke Donald.

Typical
 McIlroy, to front up and answer questions when things have gone wrong. 
What he must surely be asking himself, though, is why things are always 
going off track.Here was one more twist to the  legend: ‘It always seems
 to happen to Rory.’

One of these days he will have a season where all the talk is about golf but it doesn’t look as if it will be any time soon.

Nice to see you: McIlroy is offered words of wisdom from television legend Sir Bruce Forsyth

In awe: Man United fan McIlroy played alongside Phil Neville, Teddy Sheringham and Peter Schmeichel

Hero status: McIlroy was distracted by Sheringham, who won the Treble with United in 1999

Gobsmacked: Schmeichel won five Premier League titles during a successful stay at Old Trafford

Gift: Neville presented McIlroy with a United shirt which appeared to brighten his mood

The main man: Sheringham, Schmeichel and Neville watch on McIlroy takes a shot

This
 time last year the break-up in question was with his manager, Conor 
Ridge. The year before that he made the startling confession that he had
 taken his eye off the ball.

‘I’ve
 spent enough time with lawyers this year to last me a lifetime,’ he 
said wistfully last November. Now, as we head into the meat of the 
season with this prestigious event followed by three majors in as many 
months before the Ryder Cup in September, here we go again.

Fifteen
 months ago, Ernie Els got to play with Rory when his mind was whirling 
so much he walked off the course at the Honda Classic after nine holes. On Thursday afternoon, the great South African will get another close-up of a 
distracted McIlroy as they have been drawn together in the first round.

How
 on earth can you play with such a huge obstacle between you and 
thinking clearly? The only thing McIlroy’s got going for him today is 
that he has had plenty of practice, although perhaps nothing quite so 
distracting as this.

‘I’m 
not going to lie, I think it is going to be very difficult,’ said 
McIlroy. ‘When I get inside the ropes I’m just going to try to 
concentrate on the shot at hand but that’s easier said than done.’

Fatherly advice: McIlroy speaks to his Dad, Gerry McIlroy ahead of the PGA Championship at Wentworth

Sergio
 Garcia was so cut up after he was dumped by Greg Norman’s daughter 
Morgan-Leigh that eventually he took some time away from the game.

‘I’ll
 definitely be putting an arm around Rory’s shoulder and asking if he 
wants to talk about it,’ said the Spaniard. ‘I’ve been through it from 
both sides. I split up with Martina Hingis but Morgan was the one who 
left me. It should be easier if it’s mutual but when it is a really 
painful break-up the temptation to throw yourself into golf more than 
ever doesn’t always work out. Every case is different but for me I had 
to stop playing for a while.’

Right
 now, McIlroy is determined to plough on. In eight strokeplay 
tournaments this year, he has finished outside the top 10 only once but 
now that consistent spell of form has to be set against yet another 
off-course complication.

A friend in need: Sergio Garcia will offer McIlroy someone to talk to if he needs

Donald
 said: ‘Obviously I wish both of them the best but I’m guessing this is 
going to be very  distracting for Rory. We know how hard this game is 
when you have a clear mind, and I can’t imagine what’s going through his
 head now.’

McIlroy 
stepped back into the public spotlight on Wednesday with three former 
Manchester United footballers for company, in the shape of Peter 
Schmeichel, Teddy Sheringham and Phil Neville. A lifelong United fan, 
he must have been thinking a week ago that this was a pro-am round he 
could really savour, rather than a chore.

Now
 there was a rueful grin as he shook hands with each in turn. His dad 
Gerry was there beside the first tee as well, offering moral support.

This
 time last year the build-up to this tournament was overshadowed by an 
ill-advised remark from  Garcia about Tiger Woods, made at an awards 
dinner designed to celebrate the winning of the Ryder Cup. Now it is 
affairs of the heart that have taken the place of matters of race.

It
 is such a shame. Just like last year, a heck of a golf tournament is 
bursting to break out on Thursday. This is the 60th anniversary of the PGA and
 the biggest one yet, with record crowds expected to descend on this 
beautiful corner of England to greet virtually everyone who is anyone in
 the European game.

Let us hope it emerges. But, right now, McIlroy’s bombshell is the only topic in town.

All change then: McIlroy posted this tweet just last week which didn't indicate any problems
