Camilla Long, who alleges that Travis groped her during an interview, was demanded to move by the former DJ because she was making him feel 'uncomfortable

Travis demanded one of his alleged victims move seats in the courtroom, saying she was making him ‘uncomfortable’.

In a bizarre episode moments before he was sentenced, he confronted journalist Camilla Long, who has told how he allegedly groped her during an interview.

He spotted she was sitting in the courtroom’s public gallery, just behind the glass-panelled dock where he was awaiting sentence, and rounded on her, banging on the glass between them.

He shouted through the toughened security glass, saying: ‘You’re making me uncomfortable. Get where you should be – in the Press gallery.’

Miss Long, a Sunday Times columnist, gestured to the packed Press benches and said the seats were all full. Travis turned to the Press and shouted: ‘Anyone want to give her a seat?’

The uncomfortable exchange was interrupted when the judge re-entered the courtroom at Southwark Crown Court to pass his sentence on Travis. 

In a 2012 article, published five months before Travis was first arrested, Miss Long said the former DJ had repeatedly groped and fondled her during an interview about his forthcoming meeting with Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

She wrote: ‘I spent 90 minutes with the former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis and I don’t think there is a part of my body that he didn’t grope.

‘He fondled my foot, inched his hands up my thighs, tried to make me sit on his lap and kissed me.

‘He copped a feel of my hips when I foolishly asked for a tour of his studio, stroked my chin and my back and gave me a full body hug as I left.’

Miss Long was asked to give evidence at the trial but said she had declined as she wanted to write about the episode immediately and could not have done so if she had been a witness.

Dave Lee Travis said he is not a 'sexual predator' after he was handed a suspended sentence for one count of sexual assault

Travis was not charged with any offence in connection with her account.

Speaking after the sentencing, Miss Long said she had found the courtroom confrontation with Travis ‘incredibly intimidating’.

She added: ‘I’m a little bit disappointed, I would have liked a slightly harsher sentence.’

The single guilty verdict against Travis leaves taxpayers with a bill of up to £1million.

The former BBC star was forced to sell his home to help pay his own £350,000 legal costs.

But that sum is dwarfed by the costs run up by police, prosecutors and the courts.

Even before his first trial started in January, huge amounts had been run up during the police inquiry. 

Travis then spent 39 days in court spread across two trials, potentially costing around £400,000.

On top of this is the salary of the judge, court staff and legal clerks, remuneration for jurors and overheads at the courthouse.

The Crown Prosecution Service was unable to provide a detailed breakdown of its costs, but the bill for hiring Miranda Moore, QC, in the first trial was £59,061.23.
