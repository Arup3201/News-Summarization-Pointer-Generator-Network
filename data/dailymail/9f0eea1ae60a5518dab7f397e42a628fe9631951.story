The HTC One smartphone may have beaten Apple and Samsung to win the T3 magazine gadget of the year award, but its maker is struggling to turn a profit.

The Taiwanese technology group has reported its first ever loss of $100m (£62m) in the three months to September.

The news comes as the world’s biggest memory chipmaker, Samsung, is predicted to post a record profit for the same period.

HTC's troubles have pushed its shares down some 55 per cent for the year to date and sparked calls for the company to consider a radical overhaul

HTC was one of the market leaders in Android smartphones, but has lost ground to rivals such as Samsung and Apple in recent years.

Its woes that have been exacerbated by supply chain constraints and internal turmoil.

‘Fundamentally there are a lot of things that need to be fixed,’ said Laura Chen at BNP Paribas, adding that HTC needed to work on marketing, supply chain management and streaming its product line.

HTC's troubles have pushed its shares down some 55 per cent for the year to date and sparked calls for the company to consider a radical overhaul.

Its share of the global smartphone market has plummeted from a peak of 10.3 per cent in the third quarter of 2011 to 2.6 per cent in the most recent quarter, according to research firm Gartner.

Dennis Chan, an analyst at Yuanta Securities in Taipei, said HTC has been hurt by its insistence on using more expensive components, particularly chips, for low-end markets like China, cutting profit-margins down to razor-thin levels.

The company works with California-based chip vendor Qualcomm Inc for most of its models.

The HTC One Android smartphone is set apart from competitors' handsets by its dual frontal stereo speakers powered by built-in amplifiers and 'BlinkFeed' that streams live content onto one screen.

A Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIPR) survey last month found that a fifth of Android users are ditching their devices in favour of Apple's iPhone.

The report revealed that 20 per cent of new Apple iPhone customers had previously owned an Android device, while only seven per cent of Samsung buyers have previously owned an iPhone.
