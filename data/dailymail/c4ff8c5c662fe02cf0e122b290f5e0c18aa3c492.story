The CIA gave the Intelligence Star to a 14-year-old for her behavior during a home invasion while living with her station chief father overseas in the Congo in 1966.

The story of the girl, who was since been identified as Maureen Devlin, is now-publicly viewable in CIA documents, Business Insider reported, which earlier revealed Devlin's actions.

The documents, published as 'The Youngest Intelligence Star,' detail how Devlin heard 'three masked burglars' snatching items in her room, and how she faked being asleep.

'The girl heard the burglars discussing the possibility of harming her,' the documents say. 'She understood their local language, Lingala, but she did not understand the word rape, only that it was a physical threat. They turned on the lights, and one used a butcher knife to cut her nightgown. She managed to roll over and cover herself with the sheet, still feigning sleep. Her greatest fear at the time was that perhaps the men had already killed her mother and father.

'When one robber pricked her head with the knife, she could no longer pretend she was asleep. She started to speak, but the robber made a sign and said in French that she would kill her if she did. He grabbed her arm and tried to pull her from the bed. She wrenched free, jumped out of the other side of the bed, and declared in Lingala that he should keep his hands off her. Pulling on her dressing gown, she faced the armed robbers and warned them not to harm anyone in the house.'

The documents say that 'As they walked through the house, she boldly warned them in Lingala that the American Embassy had "secret and magic" ways of identifying people who harmed Americans. She told them that Americans always kill such people.'

Devlin eventually took the men into her parents' bedroom under duress, while the robbers pointed weapons both in front of and in back of her.

Devlin's parents woke up, and the family had to stand in a corner during the robbery, the documents say - 'All the while, the mother harangued the robbers in French.'

The Devlins were later told to go inside a bathroom during the home invasion, according to the documents.

'The daughter entered first, followed by the mother and father,' they recount. 'They slammed the door behind them, threw their bodies against the door and locked it before the robbers could enter. The daughter grabbed two large water bottles to use as weapons and gave one to her father. The family called through the window for help. After a few minutes, their cook's voice could be heard. The robbers had fled. The family unlocked the bathroom door, and the father and daughter armed themselves with handguns and rushed out to hunt for the robbers.'

The men were later apprehended and executed, the documents say.

They also reveal that Devlin now works inside the CIA's Directorate of Operations.
