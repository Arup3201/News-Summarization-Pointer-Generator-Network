Charles Baker was arrested on Tuesday in Memphis, Tennessee on rape charges

An accused rapist, who allegedly sexually assaulted a woman at gunpoint, has finally been arrested after a backlogged rape kit was tested.

Charles Baker, 44, was charged with aggravated rape on Tuesday in Memphis, Tennessee - 15 years to the day that the attack took place.

Baker was believed to have abducted a woman at gunpoint in 2000 in downtown Memphis and raped her.

The victim consented to a rape kit 15 years ago but the evidence wasn't sent to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation until July 2012.

A positive DNA match was discovered in January 2015. 

According to Fox, the alleged rapist was the latest in a string of suspects caught from a backlog of 12,000 untested rape kits.

Testing on the kits began in 2013 but the Memphis Police Department has struggled to get funding to process all of them.   

The rape kit which allegedly holds Baker's DNA was sent to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations a year before the backlog began to be cleared. It is unclear why police wanted to test that kit in 2012. 

Calls to the Memphis Police Department went unanswered today. 

Baker is due in court on Wednesday morning.
