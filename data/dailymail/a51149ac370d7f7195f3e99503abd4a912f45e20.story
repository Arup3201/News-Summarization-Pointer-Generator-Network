Thomas Hare (pictured) was found dead in a river in Cambodia

A young British actor described as being a ‘crazy, magical, man’ has been found dead in a river in Cambodia.

Thomas Hare, 25, who went by the stage name of Tommy Vine, was reported missing on Thursday.

He had last been seen swimming in the Mekong River in Kampot Province, in the south of the country, and his body was found by a fisherman yesterday.

Mr Hare was originally from Bristol but lived in London, where he had studied at the Arts Educational theatre school.

He had appeared  on Casualty, Sky’s A Touch Of Cloth and Channel 4’s Top Boy as well as several stage productions.

Colleagues and friends paid tribute to him online.

Writer Jonathan Harvey, who created the BBC sitcom Gimme Gimme Gimme,  said: ‘Such sad, devastating news... Lovely human being.’
