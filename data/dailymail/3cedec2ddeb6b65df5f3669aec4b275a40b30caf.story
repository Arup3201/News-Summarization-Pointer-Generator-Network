A corset believed to have been owned by serial killer Rose West and a disturbing sketch of the devil with an axe through his head by Ottis Toole have gone on display as part of a bizarre exhibition.

Murderabilia - which is housed at Littledean Jail in Cinderford, Gloucestershire - also features letters written by Moors murderer Ian Brady and Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be hanged in Britain.

Also on show at the exhibition are paintings created by murderers over the years, including a chilling red handprint by US serial killer John Wayne Gacy, who was known as ‘the killer clown’.

'It fills my heart with joy': A letter believed to be from Rose West to a friend, 'Paul', from her prison cell

Andy Jones - the 51-year-old owner and curator at the prison, which is now a museum - said: ‘I'm more interested as a collector in the psychology of these people, that's what fascinates me.

‘It's not a morbid fascination - it's more that their letters give an insight into the twisted minds of these people. You can read evil within the contents of the letters, their drawings, their artwork.’

Toole, who was born in Florida and claimed his satanic grandmother called him 'Devil's Child', said he had murdered more than 100 people along with crime partner Henry Lee Lucas. He died in 1996.

West was jailed in 1995 for the ‘depraved’ murders of ten young women mostly at the house in Gloucester she shared with her husband Fred, who committed suicide before he came to trial.

The collection at the prison - built in 
1791 - includes a pink, heart-shaped hand-sewn cushion she reportedly 
made in jail, which Mr Jones said was passed to him by the 'Black Widow'
Linda Calvey.

Calvey got the nickname because each of her previous lovers has ended up dead or in prison.

Gacy was known as ‘the killer clown’ because of his role as an entertainer at children's parties. He was executed in 1994 for raping and murdering more than 30 boys and young men.

Mr Jones said some of the content he has received over the years is too disturbing to put on public view, but some of the art looks more like the work of a retired pensioner than a cold-blooded killer.

Rare item: A hand-signed business card by the 19th century executioner William Marwood, the man who pioneered the 'long-drop' method of execution

Shocking: Original 'human fat' soap used in the Nazi Holocaust death camps, alongside a coin, passed to Andy Jones by a curator at Auschwitz, on display as part of the exhibition

Scary: A view down the corridor at former prison and house of correction Littledean Jail, home of the exhibition

British murderer Michael Sams, for example, submitted two traditional paintings of steam trains. Sams was jailed for life in 1993 for murdering Julie Dart and kidnapping estate agent Stephanie Slater.

The Murderabilia display forms part of the Crime Through Time collection at Littledean Jail, a former house of correction, police station and courthouse turned visitor attraction.

The collection also includes a number of historical artefacts, including the original hangman's noose used in 1885 in the failed attempt to kill John ‘Babbacombe’ Lee.

He was known as ‘The Man They Couldn't Hang’ after surviving three attempts to execute him for murder. His sentence was later reduced to life imprisonment, but he was released in 1907.
