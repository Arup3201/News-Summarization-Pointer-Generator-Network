Muriel 'Mickie' Siebert, the first woman member of the New York Stock Exchange, died on Saturday of complications related to cancer, age 80. 

The founder and president of the brokerage firm that bears her name, Muriel Siebert & Co. Inc. was described as 'a fabulous woman, a trailblazer and a pioneer,' by Siebert Financial director Jane Macon.

Ms Siebert moved to New York from Cleveland in 1954, when she was 22, and started her career as a research trainee at Bache & Co. earning $65 a week.

She went on to become an industry specialist in airlines and aerospace, and later became a partner at brokerages including Brimberg & Co.

Ms Siebert, who had the brash attitude associated with Wall Street, bought a seat on the New York Stock Exchange in December 1967 after months of struggling with the male-dominated business world that initially resisted her efforts to join.

The advocate for women's rights left 
three jobs because men doing the same work were being paid made more than her, and quickly 
discovered the only way to get a response from her resume was to use her
initials rather her first name.

She established her investment firm the same year that she bought her seat and transformed it into a discount brokerage house in 1975.

However, she was angered that it was another decade before another woman made it to the stock exchange.

'For 10 years it was 1,365 men and me,' Ms Siebert, who never married or had children, told the New York Times.

Dedicated: Muriel Siebert, in Manhattan in 2001, was New York's first woman superintendent of banking

Success: Muriel Siebert closes trading on her 30th anniversary at the stock exchange in 1998

After being appointed New York state's first woman superintendent of banking in 1977, she put her company in blind trust, to be run by the employees, for five years. 

As interest rates climbed steeply and bank failures became common, Ms Siebert created protective measures to prevent banks from failing in New York.

She reorganized troubled banks, forced mergers, and convinced the federal government to advance millions of dollars to make the new mergers viable. She persuaded stronger institutions to help weaker ones.

'Money represents power to men, but to me it represents freedom,' she told the New York Times in 2002.  'Once I joined the exchange, I always felt I had to prove I bought the seat not for publicity but for the business.'

In 1982, Ms Siebert resigned to run for the Republican nomination for a U.S. Senate seat, coming second to state lawmaker, Florence Sullivan.

After her campaign, the woman who raised awareness about workplace discrimination, and lobbied to have a woman's restroom established in the stock exchange, returned to her company.

She said her approach to any obstacles was always to 'put my head down and charge'.

Determined: Siebert served on several organizations to promote women in business

Trailblazer: Known as Mickie to her friends, Siebert, seen here in 1995, started out as a trainee

To celebrate 30 years as a member of the exchange, Ms Siebert was invited to ring the closing bell in the stock exchange on January 5, 1998.

The following year, while president of the New York Women's Agenda - a coalition of more than 100 women's organizations - Ms Siebert developed a personal finance program to improve the financial literacy of young people.

It became part of the New York City high schools economics curriculum for seniors, and Ms Siebert, who never married or had children, worked to expand the program nationally.

Siebert served on several organizations including the Council on Foreign Relations, the International Women's Forum, Deloitte & Touche's Council for the Advancement and Retention of Women, and the New York Women's Forum, for which she was a founder and president.

'She always pushed the doors open and kept them open for other people to follow,' Ms Macon told Associated Press.

No fear: Muriel Siebert, with her chihuahua Monster Girl, braved a man's world and helped change it

'Mickie was a pioneer and recognized as a leader throughout the financial services industry and beyond,' Siebert Financial chief operating officer Joseph Ramos said in a prepared statement.

'Those of us who worked with her will miss her spirit, leadership and great commitment to her clients and the securities markets.'

In recent years Ms Siebert, who died at a cancer center in New York, was known for being accompanied by her long-haired chihuahua, Monster Girl.
