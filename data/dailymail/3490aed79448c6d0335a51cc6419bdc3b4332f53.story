Springwatch star Chris Packham has revealed he stole a kestrel chick from its nest when he was a boy, sparking a fascination with wildlife that shaped his career.

Packham, 52, said his actions - which have echoes of the 1969 film Kes - ‘defined the rest of my life’.

In an emotional interview on today’s Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, the presenter recalls the precise moment he took the bird when he was 14 and how he was left speechless for days after it died.

He said: ‘I found a nest. On June 26, 1975, at about 2.15pm, I climbed to it and I removed one of the youngsters illegally.’

He added: ‘I think that what happened as a result of me taking that bird out of the nest was incredibly important and defined the rest of my life. I loved that bird and that was the first time that I learned to love something.’

Packham, now vice-president of the RSPB, said he resorted to taking the bird only after he was refused a licence which would have allowed him to own one legally.

His love for his charge recalls the plot line of Ken Loach’s film Kes which tells the story of Billy Casper, 15, and his love for the kestrel he steals from a nest on a farm. Billy, played by David Bradley, raises the bird in secret and the animal becomes a symbol of the boy’s desperation to escape the humdrum existence of his life in  a South Yorkshire mining town.

The 1969 film, based on the book A Kestrel For A Knave by Barry Hines, is ranked  seventh in the British Film Institute’s list of the 100 Best British films ever made, and is in its top ten list of the 50 films every child should see by the time they turn 14.

Packham said: ‘The relationship between a man and bird is very different than between man and dog. It’s an animal you coax into a tameness. You never extract the wildness from the bird. You have to give everything to it.’

Packham’s obsession with the bird consumed his every waking moment – which is exactly what happens to Billy in the film.

He said: ‘I got up before school and at six o’clock in the morning I would go down and prepare its food.

‘I would go out and would fly it before school. I would run to school late and I would run back at lunchtime to make sure it was OK.’

‘Of course the whole thing had to be kept secret. No one at school knew.’

He recalls the moment of pride when he confided his secret to one of the few people he could trust.

He said: ‘The only person I told was John Buckley, who was my biology teacher and an incredibly important early mentor in my life.

‘One morning he came to see it fly. I was so pleased to be able to stand there with my bird and fly it. And it went and sat in a tree. It didn’t perform. It sat in a tree and just looked at us.’

The police did visit Packham’s family home in Southampton and told him that he should not have the bird but they appear not to have taken any further action.

A tearful Packham recalled: ‘The bird became ill at the end of the summer and I sought the best veterinary care that I could. But the condition that it had was invariably fatal.

‘On December 6, a Saturday evening, it died in my arms. It affected me profoundly. I couldn’t speak for days.’

Packham, who shot to fame in the 1980s on the children’s programme The Really Wild Show, was last week tipped as a possible successor to Sir David Attenborough as the face of BBC wildlife.

He said last night that he expected to get ‘some flak’ because of his confession, but added: ‘But if it wasn’t for that bird I wouldn’t be talking to you now. We are talking about something which happened in the 1970s when attitudes were different.

‘I think I can honestly say I have put a lot more into conservation than I have taken out of it.’
