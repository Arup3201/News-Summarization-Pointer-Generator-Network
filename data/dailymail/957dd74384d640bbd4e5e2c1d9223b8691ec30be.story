He's about to become a grandfather for the second time but Prince Charles has admitted that he does have a preference where the sex of the new baby is concerned.

Speaking at an event in south-east London yesterday, he told well-wishers that he and the Duchess of Cornwall would love to have a granddaughter.

Congratulated by entrepreneur Corey Johnson on becoming a grandfather, the heir to the throne replied: 'I am already. But it's wonderful to be a
 grandfather again. I'm looking forward to it - but I hope it will be a 
girl this time.'

All smiles: A delighted Prince Charles said he and Camilla were 'thrilled' at news of a second royal baby

Charles isn't the only royal to state a preference for a girl, with Prince Harry also revealing that he'd like a niece - if only for the chaos she would bring to his brother's life.

At an Invictus Games event on Tuesday, the prince joked that he would love to see William 'cope with that' should the new baby prove to be a girl.

Whether it's a boy or girl, Charles was happy to describe the news as 'splendid' as he was quizzed by well-wishers during an event in Bermondsey which saw him meet young entrepreneurs supported by the Prince's Trust.

He was questioned by the family of entrepreneur Demi Owoseje, who had opened up her leather upholstery studio for a royal visit.

Enjoying the day: Charles couldn't resist talking about his new grandchild despite warnings from the Palace

Although
 Charles appeared to enjoy being shown around the studio, when Ms 
Owoseje's sister Toyin, 26, and mother Elizabeth, 50, were introduced, 
there was only one subject on their mind - Kate's pregnancy.

Toyin
 congratulated Charles first, with the royal skittishly replying: 'What 
did I do?', before adding: 'It hasn't arrived yet - (but) splendid, 
we're very excited.'

'I
 asked him how he felt about becoming a grandfather for a second time 
and he asked me if I had any grandchildren,' said Mrs Owoseje following her encounter with Prince Charles.

'Not
 yet, my daughter's too busy with her business.He said the baby was part
 of life's experiences and he seemed quite happy about it.'

The
 Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were forced to announce the news several 
weeks early, after Kate began suffering from the same severe morning 
sickness that blighted her first pregnancy.

Betting began on the sex of the new child within minutes of the announcement, with a girl the favourite according to bookmakers Coral.

Popular names for a new princess include Elizabeth, Alexandra, Victoria and Charlotte. Less popular choices include Eleanor and Florence.

Fascinating stuff: During the visit, Prince Charles heard from budding entrepreneurs supported by his charity

Good stuff: The prince was meeting young entrepreneurs supported by The Prince's Trust today

Pro: Prince Charles has plenty of experience and spent time with Camilla's grandchildren over the summer

She might be in the early stages of her second pregnancy but it seems the Duchess of Cambridge has no intention of stopping there.

According to friends, she wants three children by the age of 35, which is why this second baby comes so soon after the birth of 13-month-old Prince George.

Although the Duke of Cambridge has often said he would be happy with a family of two, the Duchess is one of a trio of children and, aged 33 when baby number two arrives, will have plenty of time to complete her family on schedule.

The claims, which were made in the Telegraph newspaper, come just a day after the second royal pregnancy was announced by Kensington Palace.

Once again suffering from debilitating morning sickness, the pregnancy news has thrown her attendance at this week's Invictus Games and next week's visit to Malta into doubt.

Kensington Palace say a decision is yet to be taken.
