Hollywood legend Lauren Bacall’s Manhattan apartment is going on the market for $26 million, it was confirmed today.

The actress died at age 89 in August and left behind a magnificent, sprawling home in the famous Dakota building.

Rebecca Edwardson of Warburg Realty has the exclusive listing and the apartment will go up for sale later this month, the firm confirmed to MailOnline today.

The Real Deal, which first reported the sale, said the building’s strict co-op board has insisted on keeping details about Miss Bacall’s home under wraps - including its size, location and floor - as sources said the apartment’s Central Park-facing frontage spans approximately 100 feet.

A source described the apartment as 'grand', saying 'almost all of the important rooms face the park'. It also boasts seven fireplaces and 'tons of original details'.

The husky-voiced actress bought the home for just $48,000 in 1961. She shared it with second husband Jason Robards until they split in the late 1960s, and raised her three children there.

The Dakota counted John Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono as residents and it was outside that building on December 8, 1980, that Mark David Chapman shot dead the Beatles legend.

Stars including Boris Karloff, Judy Holliday and Roberta Flack, were also Miss Bacall's neighbors.

In a 2011 Vanity Fair article, the apartment was described as 'cavernous,' with a wood-trimmed parlor and huge windows that 'overlook Central Park, 30 feet above the tree line'. 

Last month, it was reported that Miss Bacall's art, jewelry and furniture will be auctioned at Bonhams auction house in New York.

Hundreds of items from her three homes will be sold by the executors of her estate in a sale expected to bring in $3 million.

Two Henry Moore sculptures from her extensive art collection will go under the hammer in November, followed by six more in March; as well as artworks from the likes of Pablo Picasso, Joan Miro and Alexander Calder. 

Miss Bacall was a big fan of Mr Moore's work in particular, and his sculptures - as well as the rest of the many artworks - once decorated her homes in Los Angeles, Amagansett, Long Island and in New York City.

She also had a large collection of African Art, an interest that developed while former husband Humphrey Bogart was filming The African Queen.

As for the rest of her fortune, almost all of her  estate will be split among her three children, it was revealed shortly after her death from a stroke two months ago.

The first item in Ms Bacall's will - filed in a rush order at Manhattan Surrogate’s Court in August, according to Page Six - left $10,000 to her son, Sam Robards, to take care of her beloved spaniel, Sophie.

Her wealth - built up from a lifetime of lucrative films and her marriage to screen legend Bogart - will be shared evenly among New York-based Mr Robards and his half-siblings Stephen Humphrey Bogart and Leslie Bogart.

A sum of $15,000 was left to Isla Hernandez, who worked as the former model's maid for the last 14 years.

'It’s wonderful - I never thought she would do something for me,' Ms Hernandez, a Honduran immigrant, told The New York Post.

Another staffer, Maria Santos, was left $20,000.

While her art is soon to be auctioned, Miss Bacall was sure to stress that her family keep some of her items private.

Famous: The Dakota is one of the most celebrated co-op buildings in New York City and has housed stars including John Lennon and Yoko Ono

'I request that my children respect my wish to keep private certain personal letters, writings, diaries and other papers or memorabilia,' she wrote in the will.

Miss Bacall first married Humphrey Bogart in 1945 at the age of 20. 

Mr Bogart, who was 25 years his wife's senior, died of throat cancer in 1957.

The couple had two children, Stephen, 65, a news producer and documentary film maker, and Leslie, 58, a yoga instructor.

Miss Bacall married her second husband, actor Jason Robards Jr., in 1961.

Together they had a son, Sam, 53, who is also an actor. Miss Bacall and Mr Robards divorced in 1969.
