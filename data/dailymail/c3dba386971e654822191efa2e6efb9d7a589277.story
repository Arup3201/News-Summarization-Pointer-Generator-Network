A Russian photographer who was accused of murdering his glamour model wife before dumping her body in a woodland has been freed.

Dmitry Loshagin was the only suspect after the naked body of 28-year-old Yulia Loshagina was found in the Ural mountains in Russia, her neck broken and face burnt beyond recognition.

Her wounds were so severe that her body could only be identified by DNA. 

Arrested: Dmitry Loshagin was the only suspect after the naked body of his wife Yulia Loshagina, 28, was found in the Ural mountains in Russia 

Mr Loshagin was arrested in Yekaterinburg, Russia's fourth largest city, in September last year and held in custody while police investigated the death and the case was brought to trial

Mr Loshagin was arrested in Yekaterinburg, Russia's fourth largest city, in September last year and held in custody while police investigated the death and the case was brought to trial.

But yesterday, Mr Loshagin, 39, was dramatically freed by judge Eduard Izmaylov, who decided that there was not enough evidence to convict the man of murder.

He has always maintained his innocence and denied any part in his wife's brutal murder.

Speaking outside court today, Mr Loshagin claimed that he was framed for murder, adding that he wants to get back to 'normal life', according to The Siberian Times. 

He said: 'I endured my wife's death, horrific accusations, betrayal and humiliation. I have spent 15 and a half months in prison. I simply want to get back to my normal life. I loved my wife.'

The couple were seen quarreling at a rooftop party at the £1million loft penthouse they shared in August last year.  

Brutal: Miss Loshagin's neck was broken and face was burnt beyond recognition when police found her body in the woods

Prosecutors alleged that Mr Loshagin killed his wife in a drunken rage after finding out that she was unfaithful. 

They claimed that he dumped her body some 30 miles away in the woodlands near Pervouralsk the following day. 

His mobile phone was found to have been used in the area close to where her body was later found by police. 

An hour before she was killed, she was violently raped, according to medical evidence heard at his trial. Her face and hands was so badly disfigured that her body could only be identified by DNA. 

Loshagin, who frequently photographed his wife for Russian glamour magazines, was the only murder suspect, and claimed that he was framed for the murder.

He insisted that he had told investigators his suspicions over who murdered his wife and hid her body.  

He claimed that at the party he overheard his wife take a call from a mystery man who he assumed to be her lover. 

He said the pair had agreed to meet at Moscovsky Trakt, near the forest where he body was later found.

Loshagin said that he decided to speak to his wife later rather than speak to her at the party, but that she left without talking to him. 

He alleged he searched her suitcase and found some white powder which, he claims, he emptied into the toilet, leaving no traces.

Prosecutors alleged that Mr Loshagin killed his wife in a drunken rage after finding out that she was unfaithful

One of the allegations leaked was an extraordinary claim that Mr Loshagin had killed his lover because she had infected him with AIDS. It was later discovered that both were uninfected when she died

Another was that she died during a bizarre sex session with Loshagin, but again there was no evidence presented in court to support this allegation

According to his version, his wife was carrying cocaine for a gang but 'something went wrong, and Yulia was killed'. 

He claimed that the reason his phone signal was located in the area was because he went looking for her. 

Mrs Loshagina's mother and brother Mikhail claimed that Mr Loshagin was 'constantly changing his story' after she disappeared. They were frantically looking for her, but claimed he declined to help.

When her corpse was found, he said he could not attend the identification because he was at a 'presentation' of his photographs.

The case attracted lurid attention in Russia with allegations leaked by investigators to newspapers, among them an extraordinary claim that he had killed her because she had infected him with AIDS.

Now Loshagin's mother-in-law, Svetlana Ryabova, intends to formally challenge the verdict, alleging a taped confession made by Loshagin was not used as evidence in the trial

It was later discovered that both were uninfected when she died. 

Another was that she died during a bizarre sex session with Loshagin, but again there was no evidence presented in court other than the discovery of two sex toys in the flat the couple shared. 

Yet another claim was that Mrs Loshagina was killed by a professional assassin hired by an alleged lover, an unnamed 'elderly' local.

Investigators previously discounted claims she had a secret boyfriend but will now be forced to examine if she was sexually involved with another man. 

Prosecutors had demanded 13 years in jail for Loshagin. In around 98 per cent of cases in Russia, the courts follow the demands of state prosecutors.

Now Loshagin's mother-in-law, Svetlana Ryabova, intends to formally challenge the verdict, alleging a taped confession made by Loshagin was not used as evidence in the trial.

'I will appeal,' she said. Prosecutors are also expected to press for a retrial, said reliable sources.

Spokesman for the Investigative Committee Alexander Shulga said: 'The investigation still insists on Dmitri Loshagin's guilt.'
