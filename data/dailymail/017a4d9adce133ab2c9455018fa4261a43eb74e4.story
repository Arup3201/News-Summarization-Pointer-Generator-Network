Row: Executive Chairman of Google Eric Schmidt says his company doesn't need to pay much tax in Britain

Google was yesterday accused of leaving British taxpayers out of pocket after avoiding more than £200million of tax.

The internet giant, which has a history of minimising its contribution to the nation’s coffers, faces a fresh backlash over its financial affairs.

Company accounts show that last year Google raked in £2.6billion in revenues from its UK operations, which are officially based in Ireland. But the group admitted it paid only £6million to the Exchequer during 2011.

The sum is £218million short of what it should have coughed up, tax experts said.

The shortfall deprives Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs of much-needed money to fund public services, leaving ordinary taxpayers to make up the difference.

The company has long been accused of doing cosy deals with the taxman to minimise its bill.

Google’s UK arm claimed it made only £395million turnover in 2011.

But figures released by its parent company in California, Google Inc, show that the UK division had revenues of $4billion (£2.6billion) during the year.

Tax accountant Richard Murphy said the company achieved this by registering its UK arm as a services business, which allows it artificially to deflate its real sales figures.

It does this by channelling its UK operations – and revenues earned here – as a 'service' to Ireland, where corporation tax is lower.

Mr Murphy said the company structures its affairs so that minimal tax is payable.

'The company generated 11 per cent of its sales in the UK,' said  Mr Murphy.

British profits based on the global pre-tax figure would therefore be £845million, he added.

'The
 anticipated tax rate on this would be 26.5 per cent, which would give 
rise to taxes due of £224million. And instead it paid £6million, which 
is £218million gone astray needing to be accounted for.’ He said the 
group is 'ignoring its own maxim of “do no evil” and is inconsistent 
with its own social goals'.

It is not the first time the company’s tax contribution has come under scrutiny.

In 2010 it paid £5million in tax, despite making sales in the UK of £2.1billion.

Google’s
 executive chairman Eric Schmidt has previously derided loopholes in the
 system, saying the company was obliged to pay the legal minimum. 'We 
could pay more [UK] tax but we would have to do so voluntarily,' he said
 last year.

Figures released last night by Google showed that, in 2011, the company’s UK arm made a loss of £20.7million before tax.

Google
 said it was hit by an additional £51.4million of costs after issuing 
shares to UK staff as part of their pay packages, which pushed it into 
the red.

It said annual 
accounts, which would give full details, would be available on financial
 database Companies House yesterday. None was, and Companies House 
denied having received figures  from Google.

A Google spokesman said: 'We comply with all the tax rules in  the UK.'

Matthew
 Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 'The 
Government must make Britain’s tax system more competitive so that 
companies, like Google, don’t have an incentive to base themselves 
abroad.

'The latest dismal 
predictions for economic growth make it even more urgent for the 
Government to introduce a simpler, fairer and more competitive tax 
system that will encourage people to work and invest in Britain, 
otherwise it is ordinary families who will pay the price for economic 
failure.'

Google was founded
 in 1998  by Larry Page, 39, and Sergey Brin, 38, who had met at 
Stanford  University in California three years earlier.

The company has more than 70 offices in more than 40 countries, and Mr Page and Mr Brin are each said to be worth £12billion.
