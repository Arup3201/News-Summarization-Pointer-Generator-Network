We are more accustomed to seeing her stomping down the runway in her sexy Victoria's Secret lingerie, but Lily Aldridge showcases a more demure side in her latest photoshoot.

The 27-year-old Angel looks stunning as she poses for an exclusive shoot in this week's edition of Net-a-porter's digital magazine, The Edit.

The mother-of-one's latest fashion shoot sees her smouldering in toughened-up, vintage-inspired pieces by the likes of Givenchy, Erdem, Dolce & Gabbana, and Agent Provocateur.

The California native has been a Victoria's Secret model since 2009, and she also has walked the runway for Rag & Bone and Giles Deacon and appeared in ads for Coach, Clinque and Anthropologie.

She was first spotted by a scout at a school carnival, and her career has since rocketed.

Speaking about her life as a Victoria’s Secret Angel, she said: 'I think of it as being super-girlie, not sexy. It’s a huge part of American culture.

'The Angels, to me, are strong, iconic women that I have grown up watching,

'Becoming an Angel was a huge achievement, the turning point in my career. It’s made me a household name – very few models get that chance anymore.'

Fashion's in her blood: The 27-year-old said she grew up on fashion shoots and seeing her family work in the fashion and modelling industry made her sure it was the career for her

Aldridge has been surrounded by the fashion world since childhood.

Her father is an illustrator who designed The Rolling Stones’ album artwork, half-brother Miles is a world renowned fashion photographer, half-sister Saffron is a former Ralph Lauren model and younger sister Ruby is a model and singer.

Speaking about her stylish upbringing, she said: 'I grew up on fashion shoots. When I was a kid, I thought I was going to be a soccer player, then a photographer, as I looked up to Miles so much.

'But I was so in awe of Saffron; I watched her work all the time.'

Her husband also happens to be Kings of Leon front-man Caleb Followill and she couldn't speak more highly of him.

'I knew he liked me, so I played it cool. I never exchanged numbers as I just knew we were going to see each other again.'

She was right – four years later, they were married.

'We’re so compatible; he’s the coolest guy I’ve ever met, and my best friend', she added.

As for the future, Aldridge knows that Victoria’s Secret won’t last forever.

She said: 'When my time is up, it’s up, but I make sure I mix up jobs and branch out.'

Grand plans: Lily, pictured left in her Victoria's Secret get-up, wants to design an organic skincare line like Miranda Kerr (R)

And it seems she is hoping to follow in former Angel Miranda Kerr's footsteps as the model recently unveiled her organic skincare line, Kora Organics.

'I want to create an organic beauty line, a fashion line and I’d love to do kidswear.

'I’ve done Victoria’s Secret [so] I have a name and I can launch myself in a bigger way. But, wherever my career takes me, I am blessed.'

Like family: 'The Angels, to me, are strong, iconic women that I have grown up watching,' she says
