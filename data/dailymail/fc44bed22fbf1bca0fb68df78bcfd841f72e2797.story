The tech-war between Samsung and Apple is heating up with the South Korean firm unveiling a new product it hopes will overthrow Apple's iPad Mini. 

The tech giant unveiled the Galaxy Note 8.0 as it claimed it will  're-ignite' the mini-tablet market - which Samsung also claimed it invented.

The Note 8.0 has an 8-inch screen compared to the Mini's 7.9-inch screen and is the company's smallest Note product to date.

The new toy in town: The Galaxy Note 8.0 was unveiled today. It hopes to compete with Apple's iPad Mini

It currently already makes a 7-inch product but it doesn't come with the company's trademark pen.

The tablet hasn't been priced yet and will go on sale some time between April and June, according to the company's launch statement delivered in Barcelona, Spain, today.

In a sharp note to their American competitors, Samsung Electronics, opened the statement claiming they were the firm that started the tablet revolution and now they would 're-ignite' it.

They said the 8.0 offered 'a new era of intelligent Note technology set to re-ignite the mid-size tablet category that Samsung established in 2010.'

Launch date: The iPad Mini has been available since November 2012 and has already proven popular with some reports suggesting it has cannibalized Apple's larger products

'Back in 2010 the launch of the first Samsung GALAXY Tab with 7 inch screen opened a new chapter in the mobile industry.

'Now almost three years later, Samsung continues to evolve the sector that meets the demands of modern life,' it said.

JK Shin, President of the IT & 
Mobile Communications Division at Samsung Electronics, said: 'The GALAXY
 Note 8.0 breaths fresh life into the category as it delivers the 
perfect fusion of portability and everyday productivity – the result is a
 pioneering, pocket-sized solution that enhances and enriches our 
everyday lives, whether at work or play.

The
 firm unveiled the product ahead of the wireless industry's annual trade
 show, the Mobile World Congress, which begins tomorrow.

It is aimed at business users with its advanced diary and planning tools but also hopes to conquer the e-reader market.

Anything they can do: Samsung is Apple's closest rival in the tablet market with their 10.1 tablet, right, already battling the popular iPad, left

The iPad mini was unveiled by Apple in November and soon became a consumer favorite.

There were even some reports that the new product had dampened profits at Apple last year because its success cannibalized the market of the company's larger and more expensive models.

Samsung will be hoping, if that was the case, the same fate doesn't befall their tablet range.
