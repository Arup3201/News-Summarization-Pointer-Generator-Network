Most grandmothers are known for baking cookies and pinching cheeks, but Willie Murphy doesn't stop there.

At 77 years old, this 105-pound grandma can lift twice her weight...and maybe even yours too.

Murphy is a self-taught, self-trained, competitive powerlifter and can effortlessly do one-handed pull-ups, one-handed push-ups and fingertip push-ups, according to the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle. 

She began lifting five-pound weights four years ago after seeing a sign about a local weight-lifting competition.

In November, Murphy won her division in the World Natural Powerlifting Federation World Championships in November.

But wait, there's more.

This super-ripped granny won multiple awards this year at the WNPF New York State Powerfest competition in Henrietta including the WNPF 2014 Lifter of the Year award with several first-place awards in lifting exercises including power curl, bench press, and bench press repetitions, the Democrat & Chronicle reports.

'I wanted to become better, to have a little edge in life,' Murphy told the Democrat & Chronicle, 'So I started the weight training. So, little by little, I got stronger and stronger.' 

Murphy told USA Today that her strength is completely natural, 'none of those steroids for me,' she said.

She said she works out three times a week and eats what ever she wants including pizza and rum with cranberry juice. 

Murphy credits her weightlifting as the reason she can shovel her own snow, carry her own groceries, lift her grandchildren, and even push her own car when it gets stuck in the snow. 

The septuagenarian lifts 215 pounds and told USA Today that she hopes to inspire women, seniors, and people of color who suffer higher rates of high blood pressure and diabetes. 

'She is so spunky, sweet and inspirational,' Lisa Greer, director of administration and member services at the Maplewood Family YMCA, told the Democrat & Chronicle. 'I couldn't do half the things she does.' 

Murphy has reportedly received a lot of praise from people at her gym since her recent powerlifting wins. When people congratulate her, the Democrat and Chronicle reports, Murphy says thank you and curtseys. 

'They see I'm old and I'm not being pushed around in a wheelchair,' Murphy said. 'I'm almost 80 years old and I am still living life.'
