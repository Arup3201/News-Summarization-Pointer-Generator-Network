Aspirations: Jyoti Amge, 19, is hoping to become a Bollywood star after joining other celebrities on India's version of Big Brother

She might be tiny, but she has big ambitions.

Jyoti Amge, 19, who is just 24.7ins tall, joined a cast of models and bit-part actors in a mud hut built to house the contestants last night.

She hopes to use her appearance on Bigg Boss to show off her acting skills.

'I am participating in the show because I want to have a career in Bollywood,' she said.

'These people contacted me through 
email and I couldn't say no to them because I watch the show 
religiously.

'I will not fight with anyone on the show and will come out 
as a winner.'

Ms Amge, from Nagpur in central India, 
is no stranger to the limelight.

Roughly the size of a one-year-old 
baby, she attracts crowds of curious onlookers wherever she goes.

The teenager has already appeared on 
game shows, in music videos and has been the subject of two critically 
acclaimed documentaries.

Admitting to a crush on the show's 
host, Bollywood superstar Salman Khan, Jyoti said her dream was to star 
in a movie with the action hero.

'I really like Salman a lot and I'm thrilled that I will be able to meet him finally,' she said, 'I'm really excited because I will 
now get to showcase my skills to the masses.

'And I want to show the 
world that size doesn't matter and a person like me can also stay 
happily with the so-called normal size people as a part of one large 
happy family.'

Ms Amge, from Nagpur in central India joined this year's series of India's Big Brother and intends to show her country that despite her size she has some punch

Ms Amge was being paid almost Â£1,200 for entering the popular Bigg Boss series, which saw Jade Goody appear in 2008, just before she was diagnosed with cancer

Bigg Boss is based on the original Dutch Big Brother format developed by John de Mol.

It features housemates living in a purpose-built house who are kept isolated from the outside world. The housemates in the Indian version are mostly celebrities with the exception of one who is a non-celebrity selected via auditions.

Housemates are overseen by a mysterious person known as 'Bigg Boss', whose only presence in the house is through his voice.
