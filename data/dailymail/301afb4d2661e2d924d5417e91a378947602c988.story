If Martin Demichelis had asked for a new contract six months ago, you would have heard the groans from Manchester City fans all the way down to his native Cordoba in Argentina.

It was only a man-of-the-match performance against Hull City on March 15 following Vincent Kompany’s dismissal that belatedly gave City fans a glimpse of the real Demichelis, who had previously looked slow, cumbersome and earned a red card against Barcelona that killed City’s Champions League prospects.

Since then, he’s hardly put a foot wrong from playing in a World Cup final for Argentina to scoring City’s crucial equaliser at Arsenal on Saturday.

Martin Demichelis has grown into playing centre-half for Manchester City over the last six months 

The Argentine had an excellent World Cup and was a standout performer for the runners-up 

Demichelis was a rock at the back for City during their 2-2 draw against Arsenal on Saturday 

So, when at the age of 34 and on the eve or a return to his former club Bayern Munich whom City face in the Champions League on Wednesday night, Demichelis hints he’d expect a renewal of his contract when it runs out this summer, the reaction from fans is wholehearted agreement rather than laughter.

After all, Demichelis has played so well alongside Kompany this season, Manuel Pellegrini’s £32million marquee summer signing Eliaquim Mangala hasn’t been given a look in so far.

He may have chopped off his ponytail for the World Cup but unlike Samson, it hasn’t mean losing any of his strength.

Demichelis is following in a long line of centre-halves from Manchester United’s Gary Pallister to Per Mertesacker at Arsenal who have suffered terrible starts with new clubs before winning fans over and being fondly remembered.

Pellegrini, who also had him at Malaga, won’t be surprised in the transformation. He’s always claimed Demichelis ‘is a very important player for us.’

Demichelis is set to be handed a new contract by Manuel Pellegrini at the Etihad Stadium 

The 34-year-old's luck changed during a sterling performance against Hull City back in March 

The City boss keeps his cards too close to his chest to explain exactly why, but in a Sportsmail interview, Barcelona and Spain legend Xavi, who faced Demichelis many times, offered an insight.

‘Demichelis has been criticised but he can bring the ball out well from the back in order to get the team playing football. That is want Pellegrini wants to do,’ said Xavi.

A commanding figure who is good on the ball and in the air, Demichelis’s form was noted back home in South America, leading to his World Cup call up with manager Alex Sabella saying: ‘He had a great season in the English league which is extremely difficult competitive and physical. He responded well and I could not afford to leave him out,’ said Sabella.

And while some players have suffered post-World Cup hangovers, Demichelis has taken off this season where he left off.

Hence his appeal to be given a new deal by the club, who have already signed up Kompany, Samir Nasri, Sergio Aguero and David Silva.

Vincent Kompany was awarded a new five-year contract by the Premier League champions last month

Sergio Aguero has also committed himself to Manchester City for the foreseeable future 

‘I am playing every game, every two to three days,’ said the popular defender.

‘I would be happy to stay this year and then one more year because I think I will still have the quality to play at this level.’

‘The people who criticised me need to be more respectful of me and what I have done in my career.’

That career includes a Champions League final appearance for Bayern although they lost to Jose Mourinho’s Inter Milan. It will be a special return for him in the Olympic Stadium on Wednesday, where City won last season in the group stages though Pellegrini was criticised for not knowing one more goal would have allowed them to win the group and avoid Barca in the last-16.

Back to Demichelis though. Last season he took part in a television documentary about City where he publicly stated his desire to play one day in America’s MLS.

At the time, City would have paid for his air ticket. Now it appears, his plans to go Stateside have been put on hold.
