Cesc Fabregas has revealed that he's 'feeling comfortable' in a Chelsea shirt as the Spaniard targets success at Stamford Bridge.

Fabregas had made a brilliant start to his Blues career, grabbing all three assists during Chelsea's opening day Premier League win against Burnley.

The former Arsenal and Barcelona midfielder also helped Jose Mourinho's side to a 2-0 win against Leicester on Saturday.

After a third-placed Premier League finish last season, Mourinho pulled no punches in this summer's transfer market, signing Fabregas, Diego Costa, Filipe Luis and orchestrating a romantic return for Blues legend Didier Drogba.

With the squad strengthened, Fabregas believes his new side are up for the challenge this season.

He added: ‘There is a lot of competition too and we have a great bench as well and we are really excited about the season with so many games, so many competitions and we are really up for it.'
