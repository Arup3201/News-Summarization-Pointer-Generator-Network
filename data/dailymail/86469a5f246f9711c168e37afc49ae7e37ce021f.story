Eagle-eyed shoppers were able to purchase $400 PlayStations for just a quarter of the price after taking advantage of a loophole in Wal-Mart’s current price match promotion deal.

On November 13 the world's largest retailer had announced that it would price match items against select online retailers, including Amazon, in a bid to rev up sluggish sales in the run up to the holiday shopping season.

To take advantage of the offer, consumers were required to show their cashier a screenshot of the online sale page to request the price match.

Some smart thinking shoppers quickly realized that any Amazon user with a registered selling account could create their own authentic-looking page and list items ‘for sale’ online.

News of the loophole quickly spread on social media platforms including Twitter and Reddit with people even posting photographs of receipts showing PS4 purchased for as low as $90, reports CNBC.com.

But the too good to be true deal couldn't last for long and by Wednesday the retailer had caught on to what was happening and quickly updated the terms and conditions associated with the promotion.

Wal-Mart's updated policy now states that stores will not honor prices from marketplace vendors, third-party seller, auction sites or sites requiring memberships.

‘We can't tolerate fraud or attempts to trick our cashiers,’ said the Bentonville, Arkansas, headquartered company. 

‘This kind of activity is unfair to the millions of customers who count on us every day for honest value.’ 

In the past, the retailer has only matched prices of local store competitors but hadn't followed other retailers including Best Buy and Target in matching prices of online rivals.

But last month, Wal-Mart started to test the strategy in five markets: Atlanta; Charlotte, North Carolina; Dallas; Phoenix; and northwest Arkansas.  

'We’re committed to providing low prices every day, on everything. So if you find a current lower online price from an online retailer on an identical, in-stock product, tell us and we’ll match it,' states the company's online price match policy.
