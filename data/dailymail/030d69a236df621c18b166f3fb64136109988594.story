They shot to global fame as the privileged toffs from hit movie The Riot Club - the film based on Old Etonians who go to Oxford University and on towards positions of great power and influence. 

And it seems that their debauched on-screen activities have worked in their favour because Sam Claflin and Douglas Booth have both landed top modelling jobs.

Sam, who also stars alongside Jennifer Lawrence as Finnick Odair in The Hunger Games, is the star of Ciroc Vodka's new campaign, Ciroc On Arrival, and was hand-picked to be photographed by legendary snapper, Mario Testino.

The campaign is all about hand-picking emerging talents from across the globe and celebrating the latest young stars breaking out in their profession. 

Sam was chosen by Mario, who regularly works with Cara Delevingne, the Beckhams and Kate Moss, as one to watch in the industry for the London shoot.

Speaking about his latest role, 28-year-old Sam said: 'I’ve been lucky enough to have been given some amazing opportunities to be able to do what I love in life.

'Of course, I have had to prove myself in a lot of ways as an actor which puts a lot of pressure on me, so this campaign appealed as it allows me a moment to celebrate.'

Sam has had a lot of acting roles over the years but only shot to prominence in The Hunger Games - he has since become a poster boy within the acting world and a promising thespian.

Despite his success, it wasn't always smooth sailing. He explains: 'Being in drama school and all the training you do as an actor, you hope you’re going to make it. 

'But there’s a part of you that’s got to be realistic and say: "Look, it might not happen to me", so to play the roles I’m now playing and to be selected by Mario Testino, who is world famous for creating some of the most iconic images of recent decades, definitely feels like a milestone in my career.'

Sadly for his female fans, Sam is married to the equally attractive actress, Laura Haddock. 

Speaking about his wife, who starred as Alison in The Inbetweeners movie, he said: 'She's my female counterpart is the best way to describe her. 

'She is my mum. She reminds me of my mum so much which I think - a guy will know, right? It's important. Your mum knows like everything.'

Sam and Laura are part of a new London-based group of hot young actors and regularly attend parties with Suki Waterhouse, Cara Delevingne, Jack Whitehall, Gemma Chan, Natalie Dormer and Douglas Booth.

Douglas won the heart of the - mostly female - nation in 2013 in Carlo Carlei's film adaptation of Romeo and Juliet.

After starring alongside Sam in The Riot Club, Douglas has become a household name. His latest coup? Becoming the face of Salvatore Ferragamo's latest fashion campaign.

The 22-year-old stars in A Man’s Story, a dynamic menswear project by photographer and filmmaker Francesco Carrozzini.

He joins ASAP Rocky, Ryan McGinley, Henrik Lundqvist, Alexander Gilkes, Louis-Marie de Castelbajac and Tyrone Wood and reveals a decision that led them to become the men they are today. 

Speaking in a promotional video as he showcases the label's new sneakers, Douglas speaks of his childhood dreams of finding fame. 

He said: 'I remember being a kid and having a massive imagination. I would entertain myself just by running around the garden, I wanted to live a thousand lifetimes within my own.

'To do that, I had to tell different stories and play different characters. I remember sitting and watching Gladiator 15 to 20 times with my friends, that was inspiring for me. Then to be working with Russell Crowe and him playing my father was a bizarre experience.

'Being driven home from school one day, I said to my friend: "I want to be an actor" and he said: "pfft, it's not going to happen" and I said: "why not?"

'I always just believed that there are people doing things that you dream of doing but you've got to take life by the balls and just do it.'

And he did just that. Douglas, although severely dyslexic who admits to struggling at school, went on to develop a keen interest in drama.

By 15, he was a member of the  Curtis Brown acting agency and landed his first professional role in 2009's From Time To Time directed by Julian Fellowes.

A role as Pip in the BBC One adaptation of Charles Dickens' Great Expectations in 2011 and a role in Darren Aronofsky's Biblical epic Noah alongside friend Emma Watson followed.

His good looks have also landed him modelling work with acclaimed British fashion house, Burberry. 

Douglas has starred in campaigns with fellow Brit beauties Emma Watson, Rosie Huntington Whiteley, and  Lily Donaldson.
