Claims that Jeremy Clarkson’s ‘offensive’ Falklands number plate was a coincidence were crumbling yesterday as it emerged a second ‘joke’ plate was found in the same car.

The controversial Top Gear presenter – along with co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond, and their crew – had to flee Argentina last week after locals were angered by the ‘H982 FKL’ plates, an apparent reference to the 1982 Falklands War.

The BBC insisted they had not even realised the meaning behind the Porsche 928GT’s plates until three days into filming. They were removed when locals complained.

However, that defence was undermined yesterday by the fact that a set of plates saying BE11 END had been found inside the sports car, which has been abandoned by the crew along with other vehicles.

A spokesman for the BBC has admitted the second set had been planned for a sequence in the show, but were not used.

And yesterday the dealer who sold the Porsche to the BBC complete with its original H982 FKL plates admitted the show’s staff knew the car’s registration number before they completed its purchase.

In another twist, an Argentine judge is now reportedly considering whether to begin a criminal inquiry into unauthorised ‘plate changing’ on the vehicle – after it was found with the registration HI VAE. The offence carries a jail sentence of up to three years. 

The anger was sparked by the H982 FKL plate, which locals say was a reference to the 1982 Falklands War

The Porsche was sold to the BBC by classic car specialist Mark Waring, 54, of Cheam, Surrey, through his dealership Rennsport Classics Ltd. He had advertised it with the plates masked.

Asked about how interested the BBC were in the number plate, Mr Waring said: ‘I’m not prepared to discuss that.’ But he denied claims he had been gagged, saying he never discussed any clients.

Asked whether he suspected the Top Gear team were delighted when they discovered the Falklands reference in the car’s plates, Mr Waring said: ‘I wasn’t aware it was Top Gear buying the car, just the BBC.’

Argentinian Police have now revealed they have found another set of offensive number plates in the car

It emerged last night that Top Gear had sent one of its mechanics to inspect the car – and that a researcher went to pay for the car, meaning the team had ample opportunity to spot the ‘Falklands’ plate.

But executive producer of the show Andy Wilman insisted all were surprised when its significance was pointed out on the internet three days into filming in Argentina last month.

Mr Wilman also suggested he would refuse to answer to the Argentine legal system if charged over using fake plates on the car, saying he had feared for his life and they had no choice than to switch.

The new number plate revelation came when local police searched the car Top Gear left behind after the show’s 29-strong crew crossed into Chile on Thursday last week.

Jeremy Clarkson flew back to Britain from Chile after the incident and has since claimed the number plates' apparent reference to the Falklands War was a coincidence

But an official in Argentina claims the new plates show the presenters were planning to 'provoke' locals

The car's seller said he was contacted by Top Gear, who told him to forward any media enquiries to them

 

The cars were attacked near the Argentine city of Ushuaia after pictures of the number plate emerged online

The cars (pictured during filming) have since been impounded by the Argentinian police, who are investigating whether any offence was committed when the plates were switched

The anger the plates have generated in Argentina is the latest scandal to hit Jeremy Clarkson and the BBC
