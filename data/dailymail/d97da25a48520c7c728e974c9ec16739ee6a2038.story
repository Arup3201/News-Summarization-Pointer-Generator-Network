A werewolf enthusiast who went on the run with a 14-year-old girl is suspected of recruiting the teenager online for fantasy role-play games that led to a sexual relationship.

Mark Edwards, 44, who goes by the alias Nagamishe Shiro online, is alleged to have groomed the vulnerable 14-year-old to join his 'slayer covenant'.

Multiple albums have been discovered online of Edwards dressed in a werewolf costume along with teens in skimpy outfits role-playing sword and gun fights in a secluded, wooded area.

Edwards, who is married and from Ohio, was arrested on February 28 after he went on the run with a girl for three days.

Edwards has posted multiple pictures online of him brandishing swords and guns in secluded wooded areas with young women

It came after he was released on $50,000
 bond last month on counts of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor and interference
 with custody from when he and the girl went missing last September.

Videos and photos were posted online of Mark Edwards, 44, and a 14-year-old girl

The 44-year-old now faces charges on both separate cases. A grand jury is scheduled to debate the case today.

Edwards, who has worked as a security guard and an animal trapper, is being held at Clark County Jail on $500,000 bond.

Edwards' wife told a local station on Friday that she would support her husband through the allegations.

On his Facebook profile, Edwards describes his slayer covenant as 'a world wide secret 
organization of Werewolves, Vampires, Werecats or Hell cats, and Hybrid 
humans that work together to protect the human race from the evil of 
demons and other evil vampires or werewolves'.

He compared his group to a Jedi order for training 'young slayers that show remarkable powers and recruiting any new slayers'.

There are multiple photos of Edwards posing in a werewolf mask and fangs, combat-style clothes and brandishing swords and guns.

Edwards' Facebook photos contain several young women wearing masks and fantasy-style costumes of capes, gloves and carrying weapons.

They are pictured clashing swords in a wooded area and standing knee-deep in a lake. In one photo from 2012, a girl is sitting in Edwards lap. 

In one disturbing album, Edwards appears to be feasting on a raw, dead animal, his face covered in blood. Other images include a bloodied Edwards and a fake human head.

Investigators have taken computers from Edwards' home and are looking for any evidence of criminal activity or inappropriate sexual acts. 

Police officers who searched Edwards' home also found a freezer of animal parts but said that it could be from legal hunting.

The alleged victim's mother described Edwards' hold over her daughter like cult-like brainwashing. She said that Edwards was a friend of the family in the past when he lived nearby.

According
 to a police report seen by KTVU, the girl 
told her mother that she had sex with Edwards many times at his home between April and August 2013.

The couple fled for the first time after the girl's mother reported the alleged inappropriate relationship to police.

Many of the images online are of a disturbing violent and sexual nature

Clark County Sheriff Gene Kelly said: 'The
 guy made himself out to be a warrior. His attempt by posting these 
videos on YouTube was to reach a larger audience. He wanted to publicize
 his alter ego.'

However 
Edwards' friend RaMondo Brando, who convinced his friend to turn himself
 in after he went on the run with girl, said that the 44-year-old's 
interest in fantasy games is just a hobby and that he ran away with Miss
 Bruce in a misguided attempt to help her.

Mr Brando, who did martial arts training with Edwards, said that his friend would posed no danger to the teenage girl.

Edwards, 44, kept his head down as he was led to an Ohio jail in handcuffs. A grand jury is deciding todaywhether he will face charges after running off with a teenage girl
