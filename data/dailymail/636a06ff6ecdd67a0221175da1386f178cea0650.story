Jose Riga believes he can turn around a Blackpool team odds-on favourites for relegation but insists he needs help from those in charge of the purse-strings – and more speed behind-the-scenes.

The Blackpool manager could only name four substitutes for their 2-0 defeat to Nottingham Forest at the City Ground, including two academy teenagers, because administrative issues meant recent signings scrambled after a stagnant transfer window were not registered in time.

Travelling supporters chanted for the head of chairman Karl Oyston, who has only sanctioned free transfers and loans, after seeing the teamsheet. Ishmael Miller and Joan Oriol, two players ineligible due to paperwork problems, watched the match in the stands with their fans.

‘I’m always happy to be able to do my job even in big, big, big difficulties,’ said Riga. ‘Normally it makes you stronger. That’s what I told to the players too.

‘Let’s say one main target is to give to the fans what they deserve. All the squad, the staff too, we have to have the same idea. We will do it.’

More signings must follow, though, and Riga challenged Oyston for funds. ‘It’s not about the quantity, it’s about the quality. They have to complement what we have,’ he said.

‘It’s not because I’m difficult, every manager has his own idea. I try to make some choice based on the quality, on the behaviour, and on what I need. Of course, I need a lot. The rest, other people have to take care about the money.

‘My ambition is to build a competitive team. If I’m here of course we want a better future. For me the main problem will be getting more players in. I was happy that no one got injured, because they are all coming from different clubs so we don’t know their fitness.’

In charge: Riga and Stuart Pearce (right) shake hands after Nottingham Forest's win on Saturday  

Stuart Pearce had his own tribulations with club hierarchy the past week, after Karl Darlow and Jamaal Lascelles were sold without his knowledge. 

But he said he had made it up with Forest’s Kuwaiti owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi after ‘a kiss and a cuddle and a dance’. ‘Hopefully I’ll grab him for a bit to discuss player signings,’ he added.

Pearce also had an embrace with Riga in the corridors of the stadium, and imparted some words of encouragement. ‘The way the manager galvanised the squad, it was great credit to them,’ Pearce said. 

‘It was the worst possible preparation that the team needs. We had two players come in on Thursday and it took time to integrate them, let alone Blackpool.’ He added: ‘I’ve never seen that in football, especially at Championship, it’s very unusual.’
