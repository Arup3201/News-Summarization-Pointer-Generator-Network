Everton fans who attend Monday night's game against West Brom could find themselves in a Hollywood blockbuster if they remain in their seats during half-time at Goodison Park.

Boxer Tony Bellew, who is a lifelong fan of the Toffees, has arranged for a film crew to capture the scenes in the stands as part of new Rocky movie 'Creed'.

The 32-year-old has landed a major part in the film, which begins shooting in Philadelphia later this month.

On Monday afternoon, ahead of their clash against the Baggies, Everton confirmed there will be a film crew present at half-time by tweeting: 'Remember to stay in your seats at HT to star alongside @TheSlyStallone and @TonyBellew in the new 'Rocky' film. #EFC.'

Bellew plays Pretty Boy Porter, the best pound-for-pound fighter on the planet and the man standing in the way of Adonis Creed - the son of late former heavyweight champion Apollo Creed.

Sylvester Stallone, who claims to be an Everton fan after attending the club's 1-1 draw with Reading in January 2007 following an invite from Blues shareholder and Planet Hollywood owner Robert Earl, reprises his role as legendary boxer Rocky Balboa to train Creed Junior for the most important bout of his life.

Bellew is unable to attend the Premier League clash against the Baggies but he was keen to involve his fellow Evertonians in his latest project after witnessing the raucous reception given to a scarf-waving Stallone eight years ago.

In a message to those who will be inside the ground on Monday, Bellew said: 'I would like you to stay in your seats at half-time and keep any eye on the big screens for a very special guest to make a welcome return to Goodison Park.

'Be sure you make as much noise as possible - go absolutely nuts at half-time - to help us create a brilliant atmosphere. I have seen firsthand what kind of noise Evertonians create – it will be perfect for the scene.'
