During the lengthy inquest into England’s dismal performance at last summer’s World Cup, Roy Hodgson reflected on a team that had been roughed up at the highest level.

England were bullied off the ball in the opening two games against Italy and Uruguay, showing too much respect for the opposition. Hodgson demanded change.

His team had been intimidated by Luis Suarez, second best to every ball, as England were dumped out of the World Cup after just six days.

Weeks after the tournament, at a debrief with England’s coaches, Hodgson told his staff that they would go back to basics for the Euro 2016 qualification campaign.

The old-school, British mentality was to make a return and for all the right reasons. Hodgson wanted England to be difficult to beat again.

He spoke with assistant manager Ray Lewington and coach Gary Neville, telling them he wanted his new England team to have a more muscular presence on the pitch.

The head coach wanted his team to be stronger, to concentrate on the physical characteristics of the game again after those humbling defeats against Italy and Uruguay, plus the dead rubber against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte.

Hodgson was convinced his team had gone soft, playing to the gallery as the nation demanded a side that could keep possession and stamp their personality on games in the same way as Spain, Holland, France or Germany.

The outcome, after Hodgson (right) claimed he wanted to ‘bottle what I’m seeing’ during their pre-tournament training camp at Vale de Lobo in Portugal, was elimination from the World Cup.

Although Hodgson wanted his team to be slick and to pass the ball with purpose, he vowed that the rough would go with the smooth for the final two years of his contract.

In November, when England renewed their rivalry with Scotland at Celtic Park, the coaching staff agreed unanimously that they emerged from the physical confrontation with the upper hand.

Hodgson has introduced the tenacious qualities of Aston Villa midfielder Fabian Delph to the team, encouraging him to make the meaty challenges in the centre of the park.

‘I do like a tackle,’ he admitted on Sunday as England continued their preparations for the prestige friendly against Italy on Tuesday.

Less than a year ago, when England played the Italians in the opening World Cup group game in Manaus, Hodgson’s defence could not lay a glove on the Azzurri. Something had to change.

The test for this team, with this new rugged approach, is to travel to Turin and secure a result with a depleted team against a side ranked 10th in the world.

Rooney was in the team against Italy last summer, out on the left in the World Cup opener as Hodgson attempted to accommodate Liverpool forward Daniel Sturridge. Everyone has learned a lesson from that.

The England captain is comfortable with the new approach, eager to please the manager after adopting a new strategy. So far, with seven successive victories since they exited the World Cup, it has worked.

Rooney said: ‘You don’t want to go into games with teams enjoying playing against you, you want teams to look at England and think, “We know we have a tough game. It is going to be physically hard against them, we are going to have to defend and we are going to have to be good on the ball to keep the ball”.

‘It’s maybe not so much nasty, but being aggressive. Not in a bad way in terms of we are putting really hard tackles in, but we are getting up to the ball quickly, we are harrying teams and making them make mistakes. At the minute we have the tactics right.’

On Tuesday, when the players take the field in Turin, they will be met with the uncompromising Juventus trio of Giorgio Chiellini, Leonardo Bonucci and Andrea Barzagli in their favoured 3-5-2 formation.

‘Italy will be very good on the ball and there will be times when they are able to play out so we have to make sure we pick our moments right and not get picked off,’ added Rooney.

‘It is moving in a good direction. We are learning with every game since the World Cup, we are getting better and there is an excitement back about England.’

It is a bit early for that, but at least they have made a fresh start.
