Dylan Hartley has lifted the lid on the social-media ‘bullying’ he has endured which came to a head after his yellow card in the recent defeat against South Africa.

The England hooker has become familiar with the demoralising routine: on-field crime and punishment, followed by a mixture of legitimate criticism and excessive abuse. This time, he had cause to believe he had been harshly penalised for his actions, but that didn’t stop the Twitter trolls tearing into him.

In the aftermath of that QBE series match on November 15, Hartley exposed some of the hostile comments he was receiving. Now, having been recalled to the starting XV after being demoted to the bench for the win against Samoa, the 28-year-old has spoken out about the online bile he has had to face.

Asked about retweeting several messages, he said: ‘Those were the nice ones as well. I got sick of it because I get quite a bit of that on a regular basis. That week all we had got is stick. So I thought I’d do it to highlight that it’s going on. People shouldn’t accept it. I wasn’t upset or drunk, I just thought it was the best way for people to see what they (trolls) write. Hopefully I made some people realise.’

Hartley’s experience of such a social-media backlash follows recent events which led to one of Britain’s leading Olympians becoming a target, and he added: ‘Just because Jess Ennis-Hill is a pretty young lady who you shouldn’t bully, you shouldn’t do it to anyone. Just because I’m a big, burly rugby player, I have feelings too. You can’t cyber-bully anyone.’

The unsavoury abuse was prompted by Hartley’s latest disciplinary episode, but this one was different to some of his more notorious offences. The Springboks were repeatedly pulling down England’s lethal driving maul and when the referee took no action while Duane Vermeulen lay on the floor trying to illegally disrupt the pack, Hartley simply walked over him.

Sin-binned for stamping, Hartley insists what he did is standard practice at club level. ‘It was stupid, yeah, but it wasn’t crazy,’ he said. ‘I made a point of tapping him before I did it and told the ref he was in the way and wasn’t moving. I didn’t go for a knee, I went for a fleshy part! I knew stamping was illegal so I walked over him.

‘In most club games, you would get away with that, but on the big stage it’s been made pretty clear you can’t. Bloody slow-motion cameras! It was stupid but it wasn’t red mist. In a club game you can probably police that yourselves but on the big stage, no.’
