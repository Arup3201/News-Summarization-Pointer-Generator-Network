Barack Obama received a rapturous reception Tuesday from a huge crowd of students as he announced measures to make it easier to repay their enormous loans.

The president addressed a crowd of 10,000 at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta after signing in new rules to shake up the student loans system.

Obama changed rules governing how debt collecting companies treat early repayments - making it so high-interest debt is paid off first.

Man with a plan: Obama spoke today about his aspirations for college to be more affordable for all

The measure, passed via a presidential memorandum - which does not require approval from Congress - also changed how loan providers keep students informed.

They will now have to give fuller information about repayment options, and tell students when they fall behind. Total student debt stands at more than $1trillion nationally.

His new rules are a response to the arcane loans system at the moment, which can be confusing to navigate and result in mounting charges.

Obama also called for a website which would collate all the information on a student's federal loans in one place - and provide a simple way to forward complaints, in a so-called 'student aid bill of rights'.

Touch me: Obama shook hands with some of the enthusiastic crowd as he spoke about reducing their enormous debts

Not only should every American be able to afford college, Obama said, they also should be able to afford the loan payments that kick in with a vengeance once they graduate.

'We're trying to tackle this problem from every angle,' Obama said. 'We want to make this experience more affordable, because you're not just investing in yourselves, you're investing in your nation.'

In the Oval Office ahead of his brief visit Obama signed the memo, aimed at third parties like Navient - formerly Sallie Mae - that contract with the government to collect on loans.

The presidential steps aim to crack down on a student loan system known for being complex and confusing to navigate. In recent years, lawsuits and critical government reports have cast a light on industry abuses and the difficulties facing borrowers.

Sell-out: Some 10,000 cheered Obama on as he announced measures to tackle America's arcane student loans system

A Consumer Financial Protection Bureau study last year found borrowers were getting little help when they ran into trouble and had few affordable repayment options.

And in May, Sallie Mae reached a $60million settlement with the Justice Department to resolve allegations it charged military members excessive interest rates and improperly sought default judgments.

When Vickie Kight of Houston couldn't afford to pay the interest accruing on her loans, she turned to her loan servicer for help - and says she didn't get it.

Her wages being garnished, Kight dropped out of Louisiana's Southern University, returning to school only years later once her finances were under control.

Getting the memo: Obama enacted a bundle of rule changes via a presidential memorandum in the Oval Office

'They were very aggressive with me,' Kight said in an interview. Her student loan servicer eventually passed her loan onto a collection agency.

'That's when it got really hectic. They weren't providing much information. They just said you owe this much to the bank.'

Obama also floated the possibility of proposing legal changes to how student loans are affected by bankruptcy.

Currently, student loans cannot typically be discharged even in bankruptcy. His memo also requires servicers to apply early payments to loans with the highest interest rates, helping students pay off debt faster.

Shaking it off: Obama shook hands with some of the excited students at the speaking engagement

Although Obama has long lamented the high cost of college, he's run into obstacles that have limited his efforts to improve the situation.

Using his executive authority, Obama expanded a federal repayment plan to allow more low-income Americans to cap their payments.

But when Obama this year proposed to eliminate the '529' college savings plan to make way for education tax benefits, opposition was so strong that he had to jettison the idea.

And the president's $60billion pitch this year for two years of free community college has gained little traction in the Republican-controlled Congress.

The government estimates total U.S. student debt exceeds $1.1trillion, with around 7million Americans in default.
