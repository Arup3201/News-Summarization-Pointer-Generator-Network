Nearly 900,000 Britons have been issued with a fine for motoring offences while driving on holiday abroad. 

One in 12 holidaymakers have been collared for breaking road rules on foreign trips in their own car, according to a survey.

The findings sparked a warning for British travellers to get up to speed with little-known local laws including a Spanish ban on driving in flip-flops and a French restriction on satnav speed camera alerts. 

Laws in European countries include carrying a spare pair of spectacles in Italy, having a clean car in Russia and not wearing flip-flops to drive in Spain

The research comes amid a row over an EU Directive that will make it easier for police in Europe to trace errant British motorists whilst foreign drivers in the UK often escape scot-free.

The research found the popularity of self-drive holidays across the English Channel has soared in the past two years. 

Nearly a quarter of the UK's 47.4 million adults have gone abroad by car - a total of 11.5 million British holidaymakers.

But 80 per cent have been stopped for motoring misdemeanours or picked up a parking ticket - equivalent to 878,000 penalised abroad. The figure does not include Britons fined on fly-drive holidays in hire cars.

The survey of 2,054 adults indicated that 4.4 million will set off from home on road trips abroad this year alone - 2.6 million more than in 2012 when just 1.8 million drove to their destination.

24% of the UK's 47.4 million adults have gone abroad by car, it's essential that British travellers get up to speed with little-known local laws in Europe before travelling

It found that men are much more likely to contravene local laws than women - 9 per cent did so compared to 6 per cent of women - and those aged under 25 are the worst offenders.

'There are lots of different laws when you drive in continental Europe and they vary from country to country,' Victoria Walton, Insurance company NFU Mutual's motor insurance specialist, said.

SPAIN Fines for driving in flip-flops and ban on using DIY hands-free phone kits at the wheel

FRANCE Fines of up to Euro £1,200 for using a satnav with the speed camera location warning enabled and compulsory to carry a DIY breathalyser

GERMANY Illegal to stop on an autobahn, even when running out of fuel

ITALY Compulsory to park in the direction of traffic on that side of the road and carry spare pair of spectacles if needed for driving

RUSSIA AND BELARUS On-the-spot fine for driving a dirty car

CYPRUS Honking a horn near a hospital prohibited

DENMARK Mandatory to check under car for children hiding before driving off

LUXEMBOURG All cars must have windscreen wipers...even if they don't have a windscreen

SCANDINAVIA First region to make daytime use of headlights compulsory

'You may not know that it is the law to carry a breathalyser in France, illegal to use a hands-free kit in Spain and compulsory that drivers who wear glasses carry a spare pair in their vehicle in Italy and Spain.

'British tourists are also at risk of serious fines if they drive wearing flip-flops or do not indicate on the motorway in Spain.'

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said holidaymakers face fines for driving a dirty car in Russia or honking their horn near a hospital in Cyprus and warned that travellers could even be arrested if caught unawares.

'It's easy to throw caution to the wind when on holiday but it's important to be aware of the local laws and customs before you set off,' FCO Minister Mark Simmonds said.

'Laws and customs vary widely from country to country. We want people to enjoy their holidays so we encourage them to be prepared.'

Motorists also risk fines for driving without the minimum third party insurance required throughout Europe and advised travellers to check policies to ensure they are covered on the Continent.

'Anyone planning a self-drive trip to Europe this summer must check both their insurance and breakdown cover extends to European travel,' said Walton.

'Some policies do not provide this cover as standard. You risk being seriously out of pocket and, more importantly, breaking the law without the adequate cover.'

One in twelve holidaymakers have been stopped for breaking road rules on foreign trips in their own car

The 2011 EU Directive is due to come into force next year after a ruling by the European Court of Justice overturned a UK opt-out.

The clampdown gives overseas authorities the go-ahead to electronically access driver records at the DVLA to pursue fines which are currently only enforceable if drivers are stopped by a police officer.

Britain fought it on the economic grounds that the cost of upgrading DVLA computers to enable instant exchange of registered keeper details and the expense of processing penalties outweigh the income generated from fines.
