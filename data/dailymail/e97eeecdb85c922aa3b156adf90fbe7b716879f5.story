Twenty-three people have been injured during a haunted hayride after the trailer that was carrying them flipped over in a forest in Maine.

The unnamed victims - three of whom suffered serious injures - were travelling on The Gauntlet Haunted Night Ride trailer at Pumpkin Land in Mechanic Falls when the vehicle overturned.

Two people were airlifted to hospital, while the 21 others - including the driver - were taken by ambulance to Central Maine Medical Center and St Mary's Regional Medical Center.

The accident occurred at around 8.30pm yesterday at the top of a hill at Harvest Hill Farms, situated on Route 26, around 30 miles north of Portland, according to the Portland Press Herald.

During the ride, which includes 'things that jump and scream in the night', the driver of a jeep pulling the trailer missed a right-hand turn, said Androscoggin County Sheriff, Guy Desjardins.

The vehicle then flipped over, injuring everyone on board and the driver. 'The trailer jackknifed and the jeep went off the road,' Mr Desjardins said, describing the woodland hill as 'very steep'.

He added: 'I’ve never witnessed a single incident that resulted in so many injuries.'

Following the incident, seven fire crews and three police departments - including state police - rushed to the scene, David Clukey, of the Mechanic Falls Fire Department, told CNN. 

He said the most seriously injured were transported to hospital by LifeFlight, but refused to offer further details on their current condition.

Jennifer Johnson, a nursing supervisor at St. Mary's in Lewiston, said the hospital had received seven patients from the incident, all of whom were 'stable'.

Last night, the Portland Fire Department tweeted: 'Thoughts and prayers with the victims, their families, and the emergency crews operating … in Mechanic Falls.'

Authorities remain at the scene investigating the cause of the crash. Police will reconstruct the scene of the accident tomorrow, according to WMTW 8.

A Harvest Hill Farms representative said via the attraction's Facebook page that the site will be closed tomorrow for investigative purposes.

All of the victims are believed to be aged 15 or older.
