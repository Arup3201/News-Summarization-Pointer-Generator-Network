This is the garish two-tone velvet Land Rover which has been spotted on the streets of Manchester. 

The £60,000 Land Rover Discovery, surrounded in a red and blue eye-catching wrap, was seen parked for ten minutes in the city's plush King Street shopping area today.

The vehicle's normal paint job has been replaced by dark blue velvet across the body of the car, while the roof has been covered in red velvet - a job which would have cost thousands.

Britain's most vulgar car? The garish two-tone velvet Land Rover spotted on the streets of Manchester

The owner is the latest in a string of luxury car owners around the globe which have opted to have their cats coated in the extravagant woven fabric.

And the unmissable supercars appear to attract the public’s attention everywhere they go.

While it was parked, shoppers were seen walking up to the car to catch a look - or a feel - of the unique material, despite the driver still being inside.

One shopper said: 'People kept walking up to the car to touch it. It felt really nice. The driver didn't look too happy that everyone kept touching his expensive car.

'I'd never seen a car like it before, especially in such a vulgar two-tone colour. It really stood out.

'The driver was brave taking it out in Manchester during January because I can't imagine you'd want to get it wet!'

The velvet wrap, which comes in a range of colours, is one of the latest trends in super car customisation.

A British company, Raccoon, was responsible for the UK's first velvet-covered car - a black Porsche that became an internet sensation when it was seen in London last summer. 

The car came to the attention of the world when former Apprentice contestant James Lester spotted the Panamera outside his estate agents in Fulham, west London.

Attention-grabbing: Two curious passers-by stop to stroke the vehicle, which costs an estimated £300,000

Vibrant: The material comes in a range of other colours, including blue, orange - and this shocking hot pink

Racoon says its service has proved increasingly popular as an alternative to ‘boring’ standardised paintwork.

The service involves ‘wrapping’ the cars in a durable and weather resistant fibre to the colour of the driver's choice.  

The wrap is then coated with special adhesives and durable textile fibers to withstand severe weather conditions.

The material, which lasts for roughly three years, can be cleaned by hand or using a jet wash and does not need special products.

The first velvet-wrapped car, a £100,000 Porsche Panamera, was spotted in Fulham, London last year
