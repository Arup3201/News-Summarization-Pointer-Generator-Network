A daredevil artist took his life in his hands by going beneath the waves to get face to face with a pack of killer sharks and sketch their portraits.

Jonathan Truss, 52, from Bournemouth, Dorset, is the first person ever to sketch great white sharks in their natural habitat off the coast of South Africa.

He travelled to the country and dived in the planet's most shark-infested waters to capture the terrifying marine predators first hand.

South Africa

Daring: Mr Truss believes he is the first person to try to sketch the awesome killers in their natural environment

Waterproof: The wildlife artist, 51, is using china marker oil crayons and a waterproof plastic white board

Mr Truss plunged into the ocean armed with only a handful of china-marker oil crayons and a waterproof plastic white board.

He then spent 90 minutes in a shark 
cage studying the beasts and creating a series of rough sketches which 
he later used as the basis of his paintings.

Mr Truss created his art in sharks' 
seal hunting ground off Gansbaai - a stretch of water known as Shark 
Alley because it has the world's biggest concentration of great whites.

'These days, there are so many wildlife artists out there, you've got to do something different,' he said.

'You want to be inspired and really 
want to do it - and great whites fill that gap. But you can't see them 
in an aquarium - if you want to see great whites, you have to go to 
them, to the ocean.

'To see them in their environment where you are the one in the cage is very exciting.

'Most artists who paint wildlife don't
get out there to see it - only a small minority do. Most paint from 
photos or zoos and put the animals into a wild environment.

'You can always tell because the animal's not scarred, or its muscle tone is different.

'Every great white shark painting I've
ever seen has been from photographs - as far as I can tell, no-one has 
ever gone out to draw them in the flesh.

'But to my mind, the best part is going out there and seeing the animal in the wild.'

Getting the angles: Self-taught Mr Truss spent 90 minutes below the surface on his quest to 'draw Jaws'

Mr Truss and a cameraman were lowered 
in the seven-man cage to which the freshly severed head of a tuna fish 
was attacked to act bait to draw the hungry sharks nearby.

Within minutes the Great Whites began circling and Mr Truss, with an aqualung on his back, started drawing.

'I call my sketches "lessons in 
looking" - they are snapshots which you use and draw on to incorporate 
into the finished painting,' he said.

'At this stage it is about actually 
looking at the animal. Taking a photograph is different - it is instant 
and you don't really look at the animal properly.

'When you are sketching you really 
look - where their eye is in relation to the mouth, how big the rear fin
is compared to the length of the body, what the muscle tone is, 
etcetera.

'I want to look into their eyes and 
see how they narrow, see how their brows lower. The idea is to really 
study something close up, to observe it first hand.

'Any underwater painting is going to 
be very crude but it gives me a framework and I begin to think how the 
painting might look, about the composition, the light, the colours.

'It's not going to be a polished, 
finished product, it's all about looking and teaching yourself about the
animal and seeing it in its natural environment.

'I used the sketch as a reference and then produced the painting from it once I got home.'

Teeming with sharks: The spot off Gansbaai chosen by Mr Truss is a favourite seal hunting ground known as Shark Alley, which has the world's biggest concentration of great whites

'Lessons in looking': Mr Truss said sketching underwater was challenging, but worth it to get a feel for what the great white sharks look like first-hand and from close up

Drawing deep: By witnessing the animals in the flesh, Mr Truss says he is able to get a better impression of the details to paint a more lifelike and evocative painting

Thumbs up: Mr Truss spent 90 minutes in the cage studying the great whites. He said that seeing the animals in their natural environment gives a more realistic result in wildlife artwork

The diving team who escorted Mr Truss told him there could be just 1,000 Great Whites left in the world.

The artist added: 'I'd love to think 
I'm the first person to do this - but I could also be one of the last if
there really are so few left.'

As well as his sketches, Jonathan got 
around 150 photos from his dive plus video footage to use back in his 
studio in Bournemouth. He says he saw around half a dozen great whites 
while he was underwater, some up to 16ft long.

'It was a great thrill to see them. 
They seemed intelligent - they were checking me out, just as much as I 
was checking them,' he said.

'It was very difficult to sketch well -
it was a bit like being in a truck on an unmade road, the swell pushing
me up and down in the cage - it was far from my comfort zone.

'But it was worth it to get a little bit of reference, to get a feel for what they really look like close up.'

The result: Mr Truss with one of the paintings inspired by his experiences with the great whites. He has been an artist for more than two decades and regularly travels to Africa and India to see his subjects in the wild

Another of Mr Truss's canvases: He also leads art safaris and lectures with demonstrations painting wildlife on cruise ships

Mr Truss has received widespread critical acclaim for his work - despite only having an O level in art.

He was a musician for ten years before
first picking up a paintbrush over 20 years ago and now travels 
regularly to Africa and India painting animals in the wild, with 
elephants his personal favourite.

He also leads art safaris and lectures with demonstrations painting wildlife on cruise ships.

One of his biggest inspirations is 
David Shepherd, 82, who is famous for his wildlife paintings, 
particularly of elephants and tigers.
