The perfect Best Man's speech at a wedding should be a mix of tender, funny and rude.

One Best Man managed this and more after he rapped through his and sent the crowd into raptures.

Spencer Loveridge wanted to go further to give his closest friend a day to remember with a musical show-stopper that his idols Goldie Lookin' Chain would be proud of.

The 35-year-old shocked his best friend  Luke Davies, and his equally unsuspecting bride, Kate Davies, with a four-minute rap set to a Tom Jones sample.

Magic moment: Spencer Loveridge sends his best friend Luke Davies, his new wife Kate and the wedding party into rapturous cheers and applause as he raps his best man's speech

Hysterics: Luke and Kate, who had no idea what was planned, were in hysterics as Spencer described his eating and toilet habits 

Sending the crowd into hysterics his four minute speech included the lines: 'Love is blind, Or so the saying goes, But you’ve never seen him wipe bogeys on your windows.

'Lewy’s really found the perfect Hubby, but as we all know he’s a little bit grubby. Eating bacon with his hands, from a pasta bowl, Why is there jam on the remote control?! 

'And after he’s been to the loo, It won't be smelling of flowers. Its actually probably best not go in there, for the next 24 hours

'And if that wasn't enough you’ve got to put up us too, Too late Lewy, You’ve already said “I do!".'

The happy couple held their wedding reception at Canada Lodge in Creigiau, Cardiff, and were visibly shocked when freelance computer programmer Spencer popped on a tracksuit top and baseball cap and started to rap.

'Luke has been my best friend since we were about four years old,' Spencer said

'We've been great mates for all these years.

'He asked me to be his best man in December. I had an inkling he was going to because we all made agreements many years ago down the pub that we'd all be each other's best men.

'So when the time came I thought "Okay, he's quite a character so there's a lot of material", but the trouble was it was all very disparate chunks.

'It was little funny things that he had done but nothing that you could stretch out to a full anecdotal speech.'

Response: Spencer's rap sparked a standing ovation at the Cardiff wedding breakfast

Spencer, from Pontypool, said he was finding it more and more difficult to concoct something when inspiration struck.

'I had snippets of things that I started making rhyming couplets with. Then I thought "Hang on a minute - I could do something with this' and started piecing it together into a rap. I'm a big fan of Goldie Lookin' Chain and I thought I could do a rap in a similar style. I put the track together using Tom Jones samples which fitted perfectly. 

'My girlfriend pushed me into doing it and said 'You need to do this'. It got to the point where I was running out of time because I'd put so much effort into it and I was past the point of no return. It was do or die,' he added.

'I have been DJ-ing since 1999 and I dabble with music production, which, of course, helped me put the track together.'

Spencer managed to keep his ruse a secret - despite his mates demanding to know what he had planned ahead of Saturday's nuptials for the pair, who live in Llandaff.

'Only my girlfriend knew what I was going to do,' he said. 'I managed to keep it a massive secret.

'It's clearly evident in the video that nobody had an idea because you look at the bride as I'm starting the rap and she looks terrified.'

Rehearsing the rap solidly by playing it in the car to and from work, Spencer admitted the pressure was on him before he got up and delivered his stunning best man's turn.

'It went in a blur but I was very focused on getting it right. I didn't drink throughout the day because I couldn't miss a single line or word as it wouldn't work. Luckily I managed to get it right.'

Securing a standing ovation from the stunned audience, he said the best part was relaxing after his big moment.

'Everyone was coming up to me and saying 'I tell you what - that's the best best man's speech I've ever seen'. Even the photographer came up to me and said: 'Fair play mate, I've been in this game for 20 years and that's the best speech ever'.

'Now everybody keeps asking me when I'm getting married and who my best man will be. I keep telling them it might happen but I don't want to get the girlfriend too excited!'
