Animal rights activists are suspected of setting free nearly 400 birds 
on Nick Clegg’s grace-and-favour country estate because they are reared 
there for shooting.

Police are investigating after the roof of the 
birds’ enclosure at the Chevening Estate in Sundridge, Kent, was broken 
open this week. Only 20 of the 400 birds kept on the property remain.

The property is shared by the Deputy 
Prime Minister with the Foreign Secretary, William Hague, as their 
official weekend residence.

Grace-and-favour: Chevening, in Kent, is shared by William Hague and Nick Clegg

Traditionally, Chevening is the second 
home of the Foreign Secretary, but under the coalition William Hague is 
obliged to share the government residence.

Police
suspect the damage was caused by opponents of game shooting. ‘We are 
not ruling out the possibility of it having been carried out by animal 
rights activists,’ said a Kent Police spokesman.

The
Chevening Estate refused to comment on the birds’ release, saying the 
shoot and associated enclosures were sub-let to a tenant.

Chevening, near Sevenoaks, was built in the 17th Century and has 115 rooms and 530 acres of woodland.

It
was designed by the 17th-century British architect Inigo Jones and left
to the state in 1959 by the 7th and last Earl Stanhope.

Police were called to the state-owned property in August when a group of travellers set up camp on the estate.

A convoy of more than ten caravans appeared on the land were thought to have forced entry by breaking the locks on the gate.

Mr Hague regularly uses the property at weekends when armed guards patrol the house and grounds.

Secret
meetings are held there with foreign dignitaries and the American 
Ambassador and Canadian High Commissioner can also have use of it.

Nick Clegg has described his £15million residence as a ‘haven of freedom’.

He said: ‘I’ve grown to like it. I was a little bit embarrassed by it when we first went down there.

‘But
from my purely selfish point of view, being able to walk through the 
woods and fields without having a protection team at my shoulder, and 
being able to let the kids run around totally unrestricted, that is 
absolutely lovely.
