Grim details have emerged about how death row inmates are executed by firing squad at Indonesia's 'Death Island' of Nusa Kambangan.

The revelations paint a vivid picture of the likely fate of Australian convicted drug smugglers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, who are due at any time to be sent to the island to be executed along with nine others.

Four of the most recently executed prisoners were strapped to wooden planks with a type of rubber used to make the inside of car tyres.

A fifth inmate, an Indonesian woman, opted not to be attached to a board as she was 'ready' to die, News Corp reported.

Grim details have emerged about how death row inmates are executed by firing squad at Indonesia's 'Death Island' of Nusa Kambangan

Four of the most recently executed prisoner were strapped to wooden planks with rubber that is used to make the inside of car tyres 

Dutchman Ang Kiem Soe, Brazilian Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira, Nigerian Daniel Enemuo and Malawi's Namaona Denis were all put on hardwood teak planks, which were two metres tall and 40 centimetres wide.

The planks were not fixed to the ground so the prisoners could move around or fall when they were shot.

Indonesia's Rani Adriani was the quickest one to die when she was shot on 'Death Island'.

She was declared dead by the medical examiner after six minutes compared to the others who took a lot longer to die when they were shot on the left side of their chest, according to an unnamed source.

The 38-year-old forewent all options that were given to her fellow inmates - including wearing a hood, cuffing their hands and binding their legs together.

Her Muslic cleric, Ustad Hasan Makarim, told News Corp Adriani - who was convicted of smuggling 3.5kg of heroin in 2000 - was 'mentally strong' and had resigned herself to death.

'On the day she died, she was ready. She had given herself to God,' he said.

Vietnamese woman Tran Bich Hanh was also executed on the same day as the five others but her death happened elsewhere in central Java.

She was granted her last wish not to be handcuffed when she was shot dead.

These details come after it emerged more than 20 heavily-armed officers will escort the handcuffed Australian Bali Nine duo Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan on to the military plane that takes them to their execution.

Indonesian authorities put on a show of force in Bali last month, demonstrating how the convicted drug smugglers would be taken from Kerobokan jail to Nusa Kambangan.

Police mobile brigade (Brimob) commander Rudy Harianto, who invited the media to a simulation of their transfer from jail to the airport in armoured vehicles, told The Sydney Morning Herald they 'are ready at any given time' and is confident that prisoners 'will not be able to escape'.

Central Java Provincial Law and Human Rights Office head Mirza Zulkarnaen said new isolation cells were now ready, although other arrangements were not complete.

Authorities plan to hold the Australians and eight others in Besi prison before they meet their end in front of a firing squad.

Attorney-General HM Prasetyo has not named all 10 prisoners to face the firing squad, but 10 drug offenders are on death row, with the confirmation that another Nigerian man, Okwudili Oyatanze, has been denied presidential clemency.

President Joko Widodo wants to deny all death row drug offenders clemency, believing it is a good shock tactic in the war against narcotics.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott spoke to Mr Joko by phone last Wednesday night regarding the condemned Australians, and described the conversation as positive.

Mr Joko has also spoken with leaders of France, Brazil and the Netherlands about their citizens facing the death penalty, but has maintained his country has a sovereign right to carry out its laws.

Jakarta responded hotly earlier this month when Mr Abbott brought up the $1 billion donation Australia made following the 2004 tsunami.

Lawyers for Chan and Sukumaran have urged Indonesia to look at their clients' cases without the distractions of arguments about sovereignty.

They plan a legal appeal and argue it would be unjust to execute them in the meantime.
