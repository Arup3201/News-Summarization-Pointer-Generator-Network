HSBC will offer refunds to hundreds of thousands of customers who made ATM withdrawals but forgot to pick up their cash.

Those who left money in HSBC cash machines between 2005 and 2011 will receive compensation after the bank pocketed the money instead of refunding it to customers’ accounts straight away.

HSBC’s move follows that of state-backed Royal Bank of Scotland,  which also owns NatWest. The company recently promised to return £10million to 300,000 people.

Justice: Money saving expert Martin Lewis says it is more common than we think to leave money at the ATM

Notes are sucked back into an ATM if they are not collected within 30 seconds.

When this happens, most banks return the credit to customers’ accounts, as it has not physically been removed – but until recently HSBC and RBS took the money themselves, putting the onus on customers to claim it back.

This system left most victims under the impression that their cash had been taken by a passer-by.

Both banks changed their policy  in early 2011, and now perform  automatic refunds when notes are not collected.

Cashback: RBS is paying back millions to customers who forgot to pick up cash at ATM machines

Refunds for the six years before the 
switch will now be made to  all affected ATM users, regardless of which 
bank they have an  account with.

RBS is tracing all withdrawals made at
its ATMs since January 2005, while HSBC is going back to May 2005. The 
banks say this is as far back as their records go.

Both companies are also  relying on their rivals to trawl through their own data to find affected customers.

Martin
Lewis, founder of the Money Saving Expert website, said: ‘It may seem 
odd to some that people leave cash in ATMs, yet a mixture of 
forgetfulness, hurry, and sleep deprivation mean it’s more common than 
you think.

‘It’s good to see these banks putting this right – after all, they’ve been taking the cash out of people’s accounts.’

In
addition to returning money that customers never collected, RBS is also
providing a goodwill payment equal to the interest that would have been
earned in its top savings account at the time of the attempted 
withdrawal.

Its first batch
of letters detailing the repayments were sent out in August.

HSBC says 
it has not yet calculated how many customers are affected, or how much 
money is due, but it has confirmed that it will, like RBS, provide 
‘additional goodwill payments’.

Cash boost: Most banks automatically hand back the cash to customers who forget to collect their money from automated banking machines

An HSBC spokesman said: ‘The bank is now working with its industry body towards proactively refunding customers.

‘There
is no need to take any action – we will contact HSBC customers directly
and will contact non-customers via their own bank, to advise details of
any refund.’

This year 
banks have been heavily criticised for not repaying money that customers
are entitled to.

There is growing evidence that they flout clear rules 
that businesses can only refuse to refund a customer if he or she has 
acted ‘fraudulently’ or had been ‘grossly negligent’.

In some cases, 
including when a current account has been hacked or a wallet is stolen 
from a locked car, customers are having the blame pinned on them and are
refused refunds.

The 
controversy over RBS’s ATM policy comes a month after it confirmed it 
had put aside another £400million for refunds for mis-selling payment 
protection insurance.

The bank has now set aside a total of £1.7billion 
for the cases.
