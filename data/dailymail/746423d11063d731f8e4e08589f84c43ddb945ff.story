New debate: Justice secretary Chris Grayling will bring the Bill before parliament

MPs will be given the opportunity to deny prisoners the vote in a last-minute move aimed at ending a bitter seven-year dispute over a European Court ruling.

The UK's current blanket ban on prisoners voting has been judged as 
unlawful by The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and officials in 
Strasbourg have given the Government until Friday to comply with the 
ruling.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling will this week table a Bill that includes options to give some inmates the right to vote after judges ruled that a blanket ban breached human rights.

These could include giving the vote to those sentenced to less than six months, or extending the franchise to prisoners locked up for under four years.

But the draft legislation will also have a proposal to retain the status quo as demanded by David Cameron, who has said the idea of prisoners voting makes him feel sick.

Only a few Lib Dems are likely to rebel over the issue.

Ministers believe putting the choices before Parliament will satisfy the European Court of Human Rights, which ordered Britain to take ‘concrete measures’  to resolve the issue this year.

But critics claim it could mean disenfranchised prisoners being handed £100 million in compensation if the court decides the Bill does not go far enough.

The issue was put before the Commons in a non-binding vote last year, where MPs rejected it.

The court has given Britain until Friday to comply with its ruling.

A Government source said: ‘The deadline is coming up and we are going to be putting forward some  sort of draft Bill.’

But the Prime Minister has made it clear he would not be letting prisoners get the vote.

He said told the Commons last month: 'I do not want prisoners to have the vote, and they should not get the vote - I am very clear about that.

'If it helps to have another vote in Parliament on another resolution to make it absolutely clear and help put the legal position beyond doubt, I am happy to do that.

'But no one should be in any doubt: prisoners are not getting the vote under this Government.'

Last February, the Commons called by an overwhelming margin of 234 to 22 for the blanket ban to be maintained.

There is a risk that this week's Commons vote could set up another clash with the ECHR, who could fine the Government if it does not comply with its ruling.

Attorney General Dominic Grieve has warned against defying the Strasbourg court, saying it's ruling imposes an international legal obligation on the UK.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has said Parliament has the right in law to tell the ECHR that it does not accept its ruling.

But added there would be 'consequences' for the UK's position in Europe if MPs do chose to defy the judgment.

In 2005, the ECRH said it was up to individual countries to decide which prisoners should be denied the right to vote from jail, but that a total ban was illegal.
