A man who was allegedly caught speeding by a speed camera in Plano, Texas is fighting back,Â  basing his appeal on several constitutional arguments and even a complicated mathematical formula.

In his note pleading not guilty to the ticket he received, the man, who is not identified, says he received a letter claiming he was speeding in Plano on March 20.

But before he even presents his argument, he suggests that the charges be dropped 'out of respect for tax payers, and my desire that their hard earned money not be wasted in such proceedings.' In Plano, appeals of speeding violations require a court hearing.

He then proceeds to explain, on 
several constitutional grounds, why his ticket should be dismissed. 
Citing the 6th Amendment, he explains that he has no opportunity to face
 his accuser, which in this case, is the camera.

The
 man adds that he doesn't see how the government can prove his guilt 
beyond a reasonable doubt and he is under no legal obligation to 
implicate someone else.

He also cites the 5th Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination.

But
 the man doesn't stop there. He goes on to ask for 'evidence the 
prosecution may have of my involvement in the "offense."' Included in 
this evidence are maintenance records of the camera, as well as for the 
traffic light at the intersection in which the camera recorded him.

A camera monitors cars on a highway. A man who received a ticket from a speed camera recently is fighting the charge using creative arguments

Twelve states, as well as the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands, have speed cameras

Regarding the light, he says that a video shows it is not working properly as the yellow light is illuminated for only 3 second, 50% shorter than what it should be for a 40 mph zone, citing the Institute for Transportation Engineers.

He then includes a complex mathematical formulation the organization used to arrive at its recommendation, which was done 'to ensure pedestrian safety and adequate time to stop safely.'
