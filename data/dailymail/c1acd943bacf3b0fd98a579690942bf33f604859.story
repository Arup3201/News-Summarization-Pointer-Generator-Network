The children of families involved with Channel 4's controversial Benefits Street documentary are being bullied at school for featuring on the show.

Boys and girls from families who live on James Turner Street, Birmingham, have now been victimised at school, as well as being exposed to national scrutiny, according to a community activist.

Desmond Jaddoo, part of the Birmingham Empowerment Forum, said that even adults have been pulling up outside the playground to shout abuse at children as they play outside.

The realities of life on the notorious Birmingham road - where ninety per cent of residents receive state hand-outs and petty crime and drugs use are rife - caused a national outcry after the first episode was aired this month.

Viewers were shocked at scenes in which residents confessed to fiddling their benefits, a serial theif was followed around on a shoplifting spree and an alcoholic tried to make some easy cash by gathering up free magazines and trying to sell them as copies of the Big Issue.

Mr Jaddoo said that the problem was worst at the Oasis Foundry Academy, which is on James Turner Street, but that it applied to schools around the area.

He told MailOnline: 'People are driving down the street hurling abuse.

'There is 
stigmatisation of the children at the local school. And indeed other 
children at other schools have been bullied - at secondary schools too.

'No
 matter how sympathetic teaching staff will be, children are now going to school with that stigma attached to him. They will be the true victims of all of this.

'We host a youth forum and discussed it yesterday.
 Some children, as young as 12, were saying the impression they got from
 the programme was not to talk to people from that street.'

'A team of us has been on the ground assisting the families - we seem to be the only ones that give a damn about them. We can clearly see they are people that have been taken advantage of.

The
 whole area has been stigmatised - as if to say if you live on that 
streetÂ  you're a drunk that likes to use drugs and scrounge - which is 
totally wrong.'

The people I have met are very decent people, who with a little bit of help could improve their lives quite significantly.

But the people of James Turner Street 
have hit back at the show, saying it was billed to them as a celebration
 of the impoverished street's 'community spirit'.

Troubled: The programme has prompted a storm of complaints

They have also alleged that that film crews cherry-picked scenes to get the most shocking footage, and even offered bribes of alcohol, cigarettes and fast food to encourage filming.

Love Productions, which made the programme for Channel 4, has denied that residents were misled or bribed.

Critics of the programme have also complained that it misrepresents the realities of living on benefits.

In response to the record number of complaints made to Channel 4 and broadcasting watchdog Ofcom, the channel has organised a live TV debate in which residents can participate.

But Mr Jaddoo said that the stigma, including playground bullying, of appearing on Benefits Street has scared them off.

He told the Observer 'Not many of them are keen to take part in the live debate.'

'The ten residents I am in contact with have said they won't take part.'
