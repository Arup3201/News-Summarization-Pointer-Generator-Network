A first glimpse of Skye always stirs the soul.

It doesn’t matter whether you are Bonnie Prince Charlie being rowed over the sea by Flora MacDonald, a present-day passenger on the ferry from Mallaig, or a driver on the arched bridge that carries the A87 over the Kyle of Lochalsh.

We had taken the latter option. As we left the Scottish mainland behind, that swarthy mountain range Black Cuillin rose ahead, a range of russet and mauve crowned by sawtooth ridges – a siren call to anybody who loves hiking in Britain’s wildest extremities.

At the very edge of it all: Skye is an example of the UK at its most wild and gloriously rugged

That includes my wife Hennie and me. We had scheduled four days to dip in and out of the Skye Trail – an 80-mile walking route between the tail and the right pincer of this lobster-shaped island.

Better still, we had parked in Broadford, at the Isle’s eastern edge – leaving Macs Adventure to take the strain. This Glasgow-based hiking specialist would drop us wherever we needed to be, collect us if necessary, and drive our bags between the hotels they had booked for us.

An ideal way to squeeze the best out of the trail.

With just dry clothes and sandwiches in our day packs, we set out from the remote settlement of Elgol, with its tiny quay. The precarious coastal path around the headland of Rubha na h-Airigh Baine was an instant wonder, showcasing views across the wind-harassed Loch Scavaig to the Isle of Soay. Seals bobbed in the Hebridean swell, while quarrelsome gulls screeched above us.

Eventually we reached Camasunary Bay, a wave-pounded beach of grey pebbles strewn with driftwood and crab husks. Here, the pink-tinged granite Cuillin rises 3,000 feet out of the sea in majestic fashion

Our next section of the trail was Glen Sligachan, following an ancient track through expanses of bog, heather and shimmering lochs the colour of whisky.

Munching our sandwiches atop a huge boulder next to a chattering burn, we watched white lines of water pouring down from the heights. Red deer patrolled the lower slopes, and I still maintain that the speck wheeling in the distance was a golden eagle (Hennie remains sceptical).

Best feet forward: The Skye Trail runs for 80 miles across this most dramatic of islands

We agreed, however, that the Sligachan Hotel – which sits next to an old stone bridge at the head of the glen – is a gem. Sepia images of tweed-clad mountaineers adorn the walls, and there is still an old-fashioned feel to the place.

It would be hard to imagine a more inspiring location. We watched a fine sunset from the adjacent Seumas Bar – in the company of hikers, campers and a ‘library’ of 300 malt whiskies.

For all its rousing beauty, the landscape is speckled with reminders that Skye has seen cruel times – the roofless ruins of crofts left when the Highlands aristocracy evicted small-scale famers from their land to make way for sheep during the 19th century ‘Clearances’.

We pondered this brutal piece of history while admiring the scenic drama of Lake Sligachan.

'Aye, we are proud of our heritage. But there is still resentment about the clearances, if you ask the Gaelic-speaking old folk,' said Gus McFarlane, our taxi driver.

We were on our way to Portree, the port from which thousands of evictees left for America and Australia. Nowadays Skye’s largest town is a tourist hub, with shops selling hiking gear and hand-spun knitwear. Hotels, restaurants and pastel-painted pubs line the horseshoe harbour.

We strolled along the quayside, appetites sharpened after all the walking.

Skye taps its natural larder superbly. I asked as to when the island’s famously silky oysters are in season. “Any month with an R in it,” came the reply from our beaming waitress – who, according to her name badge, was called "Fionninghua".

Just wonderful: Skye's Black Cuillin range throws its reflection into the waters of Loch nan Eilean

'That includes Mary, Juner, Jurly and Augrust,' she added.

We sucked on langoustines with hard shiny shells, landed just yards away, then tucked into braised lamb with asparagus and celery, everything locally grown.

Our final day’s walking was over the craggy escarpment of Craig Ulatota, on the north-east coast.

The still more remote Isle of Raasay was in constant view as we neared the Old Man of Storr – a remarkable outcrop of crumbling basalt. On our final evening, we sat by the sea, watching surf turn to smoke as waves battered otherworldly shapes sculpted by the elements over the centuries.

These rock stars provide just our sort of nightlife, we decided.

A five-night hiking break, taken between March and October, costs from £410 per person with Macs Adventure (0141 530 1950, www.macsadventure.com).

The price includes accommodation with breakfast in hotels and guesthouses, baggage transfers, taxis, maps and emergency back-up.
