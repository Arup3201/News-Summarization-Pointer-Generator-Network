At first glance, it appears to be some kind of serial killer's preferred dumping ground.

But corpses left strewn across isolated woodland in the hills of Tennessee have been put there on purpose to help forensics experts better understand decomposition.

Nicknamed the 'body farm', the research laboratory in Knoxville provides a unique opportunity for CSI teams to replicate murder scenes in the most realistic setting possible.

Clues from beyond the grave: A skull is left to decay on the so-called 'body farm' which is helping crime scene investigators replicate murder scenes in the most realistic settings possible

Down to the bare bones: Skeletal remains litter the woodland in the hills of Knoxville, Tennessee, where the forensic research laboratory is based

Vital clues: The bodies are placed in areas to mimic crime scenes, such as being buried in the ground or placed in a car

At any one time, there are between 150 
and 190 bodies littered among the foliage, all donated by people hoping to bring killers to justice from beyond the grave.

'We help law enforcement figure out what happened to somebody,' said Dr Dawnie Steadman, of the University of Tennesseeâ€™s Forensic Anthropology Centre. 'You cannot simulate this kind of work'.

The bodies are placed in a variety of areas to mimic crime scenes. Some are buried in shallow graves, inside vehicles or even in a noose, and then left to rot while being monitored for decay.

The researchers then let nature takes its course, gathering vital clues from insects, the decaying bones and odours.

The
 facility, which has been regularly visited by police, prosecutors and 
coroners since the 1980s, is also used to help identify plane crash 
victims and those buried in mass war graves.

Steadman
 told ABC7 News: 'We can help provide these answers. It may not be the 
answers they want to hear, but it does provide closure in some ways.'

A similar facility is due to open in 
Colorado in early 2013 to provide the first high-altitude body farm in a
 desert environment to teach forensic science students at Colorado Mesa 
University.

Investigators 
hope it may solve cases like the murder of Coty Vernon, a Gypsum teen 
found four years after she was reported missing with markings on her 
bones that revealed she was probably stabbed.

Steadman
 said: 'It's maybe not questions, the scientific questions, people have 
on their mind all of the time, but when it matters, it's important to 
have that science there.'
