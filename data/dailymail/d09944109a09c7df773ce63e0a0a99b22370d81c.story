H&M is the go-to high street store for fashionistas on a tight budget.

But with the help of designer collaborations from the likes of Versace, Stella McCartney and Maison Martin Margiela, the Swedish retailer has upped its game over the years - and it shows no signs of slowing down.

To continue their success story, early this year the store announced that they will be launching a new and more luxurious line this spring.

Named & Other Stories, the line will
be available in the capital's Regent Street store as well as in major 
European cities such as Barcelona, Milan, Paris and Stockholm and now, the 
brand have given a sneak peak of the line in all its glory.

Although the fashion pack were invited to see the collection last week under a strict confidentiality agreement, H&M have unveiled a video showcasing the hotly anticipated range.

Judging from the preview, the label
has hit all the right notes and will be offering bang-on-trend items 
such as a black coat with a cinched in waist, a Breton-striped top as 
well as plenty of buckled sandals.

The star of the collection without doubt is a floor-length gown featuring a plunging
neckline and colourful skirts and oversized envelope clutches add some real glam factor.

While the luxury label will be 
available in seven cities, for those fashion fanatics who aren't lucky 
enough to have the shop on their high street, the website - stories.com -
will make the label available in a host of cities from Denmark to 
Germany.

According to the H&M website, 
& Other Stories offers women a wide range of shoes, bags, 
accessories, beauty and ready-to-wear to create their personal style, or
