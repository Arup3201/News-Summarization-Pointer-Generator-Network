David Cameron has piled the pressure on the growing crisis in Tony Blair’s reputation by calling for an end to hold-ups in a long-delayed report on the Iraq War.

The former Prime Minister has been accused of trying to delay publication of the Chilcot Inquiry over well-sourced reports that it will  savage his handling of the conflict.

Now Mr Cameron has stepped into the dispute by making it clear Sir John Chilcot’s findings should be made public as soon as possible.

It follows claims that Mr Blair and Labour hope to delay the report until after next year’s General Election, arguing any criticism of the last Labour Government could hit Ed Miliband’s hopes of success.

‘The PM believes there is no excuse for any further lengthy delay in publishing Chilcot,’ said a No 10 aide.

‘It would be unreasonable to postpone it beyond the next Election.’

The controversy comes as Mr Blair faces an increasing struggle to retain his standing. The Mail on Sunday’s disclosure of his weekends with Rupert Murdoch’s wife Wendi Deng – and the role it played in the Murdochs’ divorce – damaged his personal image. His reputation as a statesman and businessman has also come under heavy fire.

A recent speech, during which he urged Britain to set aside its differences with Russia to fight radical Islam, was dismissed as ‘embarrassingly simple-minded’ by some experts. It led to some questioning how long he can continue as the West’s envoy to the Middle East.

And an attack on Mr Blair by his biographer Philip Stephens, published on Friday by the Financial Times, claimed he had built up a £100 million fortune since leaving Downing Street in 2007 in his ‘lust for personal riches and attention’.

One of the main bones of contention over the report into the conflict (pictured) is private notes between Blair and the then US President George W. Bush

Friends of Mr Blair fear that with his overall reputation in the balance, public condemnation by Chilcot will be the last straw.

A former Labour ally said: ‘Since leaving Downing Street, Tony has managed to remain a big player on the world stage and use it to earn money, justifying it by doing good work at the same time.

‘It has served him well, but it is  all starting to collapse. If Chilcot points the finger of blame squarely at him, which Blair himself knows full well it will, the whole edifice could crumble. That is why it is in his interest that Chilcot should be delayed for as long as possible.’

Mr Blair has dismissed the inquiry, saying ‘going back’ over events will not help Britain solve the Middle East crisis, but he denies blocking it. One of the main bones of contention is private notes between him and the then US President George W. Bush, which show the decision to go to war was taken long before Mr Blair indicated the measure publicly.

Concerns: Friends of Mr Blair fear that with his overall reputation in the balance, public condemnation by Chilcot will be the last straw

Chilcot wants to publish the notes and told Mr Cameron last year that it was ‘regrettable’ this had not been agreed.

Mr Cameron said he hoped for a resolution ‘as soon as possible’.

Mr Blair’s camp is resisting, arguing it would compromise future prime ministers and presidents. There are claims that former barrister Mr Blair and his advisers are challenging every detail raised by Chilcot and his panel of experts.

Mr Cameron can expect little support from the current Labour leader in bringing forward Chilcot.

Even though Ed Miliband has disowned the Iraq War, strategists fear it will remind voters of the last Labour Government’s record on Iraq and cost them votes.
