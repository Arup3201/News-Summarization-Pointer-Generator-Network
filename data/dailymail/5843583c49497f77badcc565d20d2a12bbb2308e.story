Her work is a major part of the new Costume Institute exhibit that the stars flocked to the opening of at this week's Met Ball.

So as one of the architects of punk and an embodiment of the Met Museum's 'Punk: Chaos to Culture' theme, surely Vivienne Westwood should have been given full attention at Monday night's event?

Instead, the British designer was cut off as she spoke to interviewer Billy Norwich on the red carpet.

Calling for justice: Vivienne Westwood wore a picture of Bradley Manning to the Met Ball

The 72-year-old was interrupted mid-flow as she described her outfit and tried to introduce her husband.

'Miss Westwood, we don't have more time,' Mr Norwich interrupted as the designer talked about her choice of clothing.

'Is that it? I wanted to say one more thing, I wanted to introduce my hus...' she replied as she was abruptly cut off by Mr Norwich who then handed back over to his co-host Hilary Rhoda.

Fashionista.com were among those aggrieved by the treatment of Ms Westwood during Vogue.com's live streaming of the event.

Interrupted: The designer was cut off during her interview on the red carpet when she tried to introduce her husband, Andreas Kronthaler

'Is that any way to treat the original punk designer at a gala celebrating punk style?' they asked.

Speaking to Mr Norwich on the red carpet before being cut off, Ms Westwood did have chance to explain why she had accessorised with a picture of Bradley Manning, the soldier at the centre of the Wikileaks espionage case, and the word 'truth' pinned to her chest.

She said: 'The most important thing is my 
jewellery which is a picture of Bradley Manning.

'I'm 
here to promote Bradley and he needs public support for what's going on 
with secret trials and trying to lock him away and he’s the bravest of 
the brave and that’s what I really want to say more than anything. 
Because punk, when I did punk all those years ago my motive was the 
same: Justice.

'And to try to have a better world. It really was about 
that. I've got different methods nowadays.'

Still in style: Christina Ricci, left, and Lily Cole wore Westwood designed gowns to the Met Ball

When Mr Norwich's put his first question to her asking if she had already seen the punk exhibition at New York's Met Museum, the designer did not seem overly impressed.

She said: 'I had a little look and I liked some of my stuff... and we'll leave it there.'

Meanwhile actress Christina Ricci and model Lily Cole showcased Westwood's latest work wearing her designs to the star-studded gala.
