The survivor of a horrific military rape has bravely spoken out about her ordeal and about the daily battle to overcome her trauma.

Kori Cioca, who was in the U.S. Coast Guard, was savagely raped by her commanding officer in the barracks. Her attacker dislocated her jaw but he went unpunished for the crime.

Ms Cioca said she lived in fear when the officer was around. ‘I was always waiting to have my face spit in or to have him touch me and make a derogatory remark,’ she said.

Traumatic: Kori Cioca spoke on Katie Couric about her horrific rape as a new recruit for the U.S. Coast Guard seven years ago

Invisible war: Cioca, pictured with her husband Rob McDonald, was one of several women appearing in the documentary 'The Invisible War,' which examines sexual assault within the military

The former servicewoman appeared with her husband, Rob McDonald, on Katie Couric’s talk show.

Stationed: Cioca was stationed at the Saginaw Hills, Michigan branch of the U.S. Coast Guard

She said that she had high hopes of her time at the Coast Guard base in Saginaw, Michigan, saying that her commanding officer seemed ‘very nice’ when she first reported for duty.

But things soon turned sour for Ms Cioca, who was the only female recruit on the entire base.

She told Couric that the officer would invite her to movie nights with other recruits, but would find upon arrival that she was the only one who received an invitation.

‘I’d walk in from training and he’d be sleeping in my bed,’ Ms Cioca said in the documentary, ‘The Invisible War.’ She said that though she tried to report the officer to those in charge, they were all of his drinking buddies. They told her that it was weak to complain just because she did not like him.

The officer was also extremely jealous of other men on the base.

‘It got to the place that if other men were helping me with qualifications, he would yell at me and say only I sign off on your qualifications. That’s how it started,’ the young woman said.

The officer raped her in the barracks one night. When she tried to call out for help, he brutally hit her on the left side of her jaw, dislocating it. 

The full horrors of her rape are chronicled in the Oscar-nominated documentary ‘The Invisible War.’

The doctor treating her injury initially asked if she was in a car accident because it was so severe.

It took seven years for her medical claim to the office of Veteran’s Affairs to come through to pay for her medical bills.

Injuries: The military woman's jaw was dislocated in the attack

Dark days: The rape survivor, pictured with her husband Rob, said that she contemplated suicide following the attack

When she reported the rape, Ms Cioca said that her Senior Chief was nonchalant about her ordeal, saying that they needed the officer for training duty and that she’d be fine.

‘I still did what I was told and I really thought they were going to do something,’ a tearful Ms Cioca told the talk show host.

Ms Cioca was prescribed a host of pills to treat her physical pain, as well as her PTSD.

In the film, she explained that other young servicemen had died from taking the physician-prescribed drugs.

Since the rape several years ago, the survivor has been on a soft diet of mashed potatoes, Jell-O and other foods that don’t require heavy chewing.

As a last resort, the distraught Ms Cioca was planning to take her own life to ease the pain. 

But when she went to the doctor to get the necessary narcotics and sleeping pills to commit suicide, she discovered that she was pregnant.

‘It was really hard, because when you want to take your own life and you find out there’s a life inside you, how selfish would I be to kill myself with her too?’

Divine sign? Cioca said she needed to live once she found out she was pregnant with a baby girl

She tearfully said that God must have given Ms Cioca her daughter as a positive sign. 

Her husband, Rob, said in the documentary that ‘she loved the Coast Guard more than I did,’ but said that he left as soon as he could once he figured out what happened to her.

The Department of Defense estimates that more than 19,000 military men and women were sexually assaulted by fellow troops in 2010 alone while serving in the U.S. armed forces. 

At least 20 per cent of servicewomen and one per cent of men - an estimated 500,000 troops - have experienced sexual trauma while serving. 

In most cases, a rape victim’s only judicial recourse is to report the attack to his or her commander, even if it was the officer who attacked them, and it is the officer’s decision whether or not to investigate and prosecute.

She now carries a knife and a crucifix with her at all times – the cross for her prayers and the blade for protection.  ‘You always have protection with Jesus, but sometimes you just need a little more,’ she said in ‘The Invisible War.’

And despite the hardships, Ms Cioca’s husband said that he’s sticking with her. 

‘There’s nothing that could tear me away from Kori that could ever make me leave, I’m not going anywhere,’ her husband told Katie Couric. 

Despite the daily struggles, Ms Cioca remains optimistic.

‘We can take down Osama bin Laden, we sure can take down military sexual trauma,' she told Couric to voracious applause. 

Sexual assault in the military has reached epidemic proportions, with one in three women in the armed forces being sexually assaulted, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. 

Defence Secretary Leon Panetta said in 2012 that more than 19,000 sexual assaults occur in the ranks, and called the military’s struggle to prosecute rapes an ‘outrage.’

In addition, men and women who report such crimes are often belittled, bullied, and mocked. The pandemic inspired filmmaker Kirby Dick to make his documentary.

In the film, Mr Dick interviews military rape and sexual assault victims who did not experience justice. It also chronicles their maddening fight for recognition from the Department of Veteran’s Affairs and the Pentagon.
