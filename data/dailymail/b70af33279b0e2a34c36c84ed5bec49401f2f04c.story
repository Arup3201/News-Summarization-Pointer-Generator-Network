Six-year-old Tianna Measuria bravely called 999 after finding her mother unconscious and bleeding

This is the touching moment a six-year-old girl called 999 after finding her mother unconscious with blood coming out her mouth in the middle of the night and saved her life.

Tianna Measuria bravely dialled for an ambulance and told the call handler 'mummy's a bit ill' after 24-year-old Jazmin Carter was unresponsive in her bed at their home in Falmouth, Cornwall.

The audio of the harrowing call has been released by South Western Ambulance Service, which praised the schoolgirl for her quick thinking and clear and concise manner.

She began by saying: 'My mummy's a bit ill and please can you help?' before explaining she had heard her make a lot of noise before noticing the blood coming out her mouth.

Call handler, Vicki Fallding, asks her to check if her mother is still breathing and can be heard saying: 'Don't worry mummy, don't worry, it's fine,' she says. 'Mummy, are you alright?'.

She was also asked to see if she could roll Miss Carter onto her side and tells the operator she will try but after a few seconds replies 'she's too heavy'. 

Throughout the call she maturely followed every instruction given to her and continued to check on her state of consciousness. 

Shortly after the call a policeman arrived - quickly followed by the ambulance crew - and little Tianna let them in and led them to her mother.

Speaking after the event Tianna said: 'There was a lot of blood on the pillow and her mouth.

'It was little bit scary. She was just staring at me so I had to phone the ambulance.'

Her mother Jazmin, 24, said Tianna's stepfather works away but taught her what to do in an emergency.

She said: 'I am so proud of her. She has done amazingly and has blow us away really.

'We taught her how to do it not thinking she would ever need to. We have impressed upon her the importance of knowing what to do.

'I am very proud and also very lucky that she was with me and knew exactly what to do.' 

Brave: Ambulance crews from South Western Ambulance Service have praised Tianna for her quick thinking

All the staff from South West Ambulance Service Trust who had contact with Tianna said they were "extremely impressed" with her actions, which they said made all the difference to her mum.

Ms Fallding, emergency medical advisor working in the Trust’s clinical hub in Exeter, said: 'I was surprised at how mature and calm she was. It was like speaking to a much older child.

'I've spoken to adults who, in similar circumstances, are very distressed and not always able to answer questions.

'Not only was she able to answer the questions I posed but did so in such a clear and concise manner.'

She added she would encourage other parents to teach their children how to get help.

Graham Jenkin, one of the paramedics who attended, said: 'Tianna was not only able to get her mum help and provide us with information but was also able to signpost us to other family members and we are so impressed at the way she remained calm and helpful throughout.

'Finding her mum unconscious and bleeding could not have been easy for her, but she really did take it all in her stride.'

Miss Carter has made a full recovery since the incident last month and Tianna has now been presented with a certificate from the ambulance trust in recognition of her actions.
