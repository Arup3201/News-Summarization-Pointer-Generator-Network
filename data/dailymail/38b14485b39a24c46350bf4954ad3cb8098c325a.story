iPad 2: The new device will reportedly look similar to current iPad models, but with a higher-res screen, faster processor and Siri voice control

Apple's new tablet computer will be called iPad HD, rather than iPad 3, says a developer with inside knowledge about today's launch.

Accessory companies such as Griffin which make cases and other add-ons for Apple's tablet have also listed the product as iPad HD, rather than iPad 3.

The name would fit with the strongest rumour about the upcoming tablet - that it will have a super-sharp Retina screen similar to the one in the iPhone 4S.

The report, on tech site CNET, said that Apple was intending to move from simple 'generations' of tablets to a naming system similar to iPhone's, with its iPhone 4S.

Sites such as The Verge have previously reported that the new tablet would be called iPad HD.

The website iPadHD.com still exists, though, and its owner has not been contacted by Apple.

'He told us that he's never been contacted by Apple about the domain in the years he's held on to it. That includes the last few weeks,' said CNET.

CNET also points out that Apple has pushed ahead with names in the past despite their being owned by other companies.

When iPhone launched in 2007, the name was owned by Cisco Systems.

Whatever the name, the device will be unveiled on March 7 at a special even in the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco.

The invitation says, 'We have something you really have to see. And touch.'

The invitation shows a finger over an iPad screen, pointing to the Calendar app, which is set to March 7.

Apple has not confirmed what it will be launching at the event.

Other rumours claim that Apple will introduce new technologies such as its upcoming Apple TV or a smaller model of iPad at the event.

These seem unlikely, as information about the new iPad has been widely leaked from Apple's factories, and there has been no sign of all-new technologies such as an Apple-branded television.

The new iPad models are expected to offer a much higher resolution Full HD screen.

Bloomberg
reports that iPad 3 processor 
will be a 'quad-core' device, a step that would put Apple's tablet ahead
of competing devices such as Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1 in terms of 
computing power, and enable a new generation of high-powered apps.

The new version of Apple's hit tablet computer will be unveiled at a special event in San Francisco on March 7, according to reports

Tech site MacRumors claims that the device will be 'near identical' to iPad 2, which 
tallies with other leaks from Apple accessory makers.

The device is expected to look similar to the current iPad 2, but offer a far sharper HD screen and a next-generation processor capable of impressive visual effects.
