Jose Mourinho has promised to deliver a bright future for the England national team and insists if three of his young talents at Chelsea don't make it, he will be to blame.

The Blues boss has earmarked young talents Lewis Baker, Izzy Brown and Dominic Solanke as future England internationals, and is showing his faith in all three on tour across Europe with the first team.

And with all three set to work with the senior players during the coming season, Mourinho is putting his neck on the line by promising FA Chairman Greg Dyke that all three will be full internationals in years to come.

England's saviour: Jose Mourinho reckons he has three players who will play for the national team in future

Skillful: Baker plays a pass on England U-19s duty, and Mourinho is backing him to make it to the big time

Potential: Brown (No 11) helps Solanke (No 10) celebrate a goal at the Euro U-17 Championships

Lewis Baker (19)

Chelsea's Young Player of the Year made his first team debut as a substitute against Derby in the FA Cup. Known for his ability to hit free kicks with either foot, Baker has captained a number of Chelsea youth sides and was player of the tournament in 2013's NextGen series.

Izzy Brown (17)

Became the Premier League's second youngest player ever when he made his debut for West Brom before moving to Chelsea. Helped England to the Euro U-17 title this summer and can play across the forward line.

Dominic Solanke (16)

Four goals in four games at the Euro U-17 Championships and 20 in 25 appearances for Chelsea's youth sides mark Solanke out as a poacher. He took a GCSE English Literature exam the day after scoring the opener for his country in the U-17 final this summer.

The Portuguese coach says he will shoulder the blame if 19-year-old Baker, 17-year-old Brown and 16-year-old Solanke do not make it for Chelsea and England - with all three staying under his tutelage at Stamford Bridge this campaign along with French youngster Jeremie Boga.

‘My conscience tells me that if, for example, Baker, Brown, and Solanke are not national team players in a few years, I should blame myself,’ Mourinho said.

‘They are part of a process the club started without me. In this moment, we have players who will be Chelsea players. And when they become Chelsea players, they will become England players, almost for sure.

‘At 16 or 17 I don’t think it’s good for them to go somewhere else to play, like in the Championship. At 17 they have to train with us and they have to learn with us. They will learn a lot.'

And with Mourinho needing to make up the numbers with English players in his first team squad, Baker could be line for first team appearances this season, while Brown and Solanke are set to appear in the club's Capital One Cup games.

All three are still likely to get minutes against Vitesse in Chelsea's fifth pre season friendly on Wednesday, despite the impending returns of the likes of Eden Hazard and Romelu Lukaku.

Mourinho confirmed that John Swift and Nathaniel Chalobah will also go out on loan this season.
