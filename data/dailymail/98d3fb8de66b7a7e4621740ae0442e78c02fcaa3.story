Air bags, mirrors and sensors can only do so much to prevent deaths as a result of a dangerous driving.

Now Volvo has developed a technology that, it claims, could eliminate road fatalities in its cars by 2020.

The Swedish group claims that by the end of the decade, its next-generation cars will be equipped with computers that have a 360-degree view of their surroundings.

Volvo claims that in a few years, its new cars will be equipped with computers that have a 360-degree view of their surroundings. If an accident is likely, the system will allow the car to find an ‘escape route’, brake automatically or steer the car to avoid a crash. The firm aims to end driving fatalities from Volvo cars by 2020

This required the development of a centralised Sensor Fusion framework to enable the various technologies – cameras, radar and GPS - to share information efficiently.

If an accident is likely, the system will allow the car to find an ‘escape route’, brake automatically or steer the car to avoid a crash.

The system looks for pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles and anticipates their movements, in comparison to the car, five seconds in advance.

An alert will be sent out if the driver is in danger of crashing. If the driver doesn’t respond, the car will take over.

The technology was developed by Volvo’s four-year Non-Hit Car and Truck Project, which will be drawing to a close in December.

‘We’ve taken a significant step towards realising the vision that by 2020 no one should be killed or seriously injured in a new Volvo car,’ said Anders Almevad, project manager for the Non-Hit Car Project at Volvo Cars.

‘The technology is also imperative for the development of self-driving cars, which will be able to automatically steer and brake to avoid collision with any object in any situation.

Fobo Tire uses four sensors to monitor the pressure of each tyre sending information to any Android or iOS device using Bluetooth

Tyre pressures can now be checked remotely with a simple monitor which sends alerts and updates directly to your mobile.

Fobo Tire uses four sensors to monitor the pressure of each tyre, sending information to any Android or iOS device using Bluetooth 4.0. 

The Malaysia-based team behind Fobo Tire say drivers can fit the sensors in less than five minutes by screwing them on top of each tyre valve.

This enables readings to travel via Bluetooth to both smartphones and the in-car unit.

The gadget can then monitor up to 20 cars simultaneously and share readings with friends and family - a useful feature if one car has more than one driver. 

The entire set is also locked to a specific cloud account so any stolen pieces of equipment cannot be reused.

The gadget  was put on crowdfunding website Indiegogo on September 1 but it has already surpassed it’s target of £17,500 ($28,100). 

One Fobo Tire set comes with four tyre sensors, one in-car unit and a free Fore tyre app to be downloaded from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. 

The kit costs £91($146) and will be ready for shipping in November.

‘Our primary objective is to focus on preventing different types of accident scenarios. But going forward, we will also continue to work on developing cars that adapt to each individual driver’s unique behaviour.’

According to Jordan Golson at Wired, the technology is similar to that used in Volvo Trucks, but this system is only used to alert the driver rather than carry out severe avoidance manoeuvres.

Tesla today announced similar safety features on its new dual-motor sedan. The vehicle features a system that moves the car over a lane when the driver uses the turn signal. It will also use cameras to read speed limit signs and decelerate accordingly

Tesla today announced similar safety features on its new dual-motor sedan.

The group's Model S steers itself back if it wanders from its lane and brakes automatically if it is about to hit something, founder Elon Musk said.

These features are already offered on luxury competitors, as well as mainstream brands such as Ford, Hyundai and Toyota.

But Tesla is going a step further. Its new system will move the car over a lane when the driver uses the turn signal.

It will also use cameras to read speed limit signs and decelerate accordingly.

Mr Musk added that 'auto pilot' does not mean that the car could drive itself - as he put it, a driver cannot 'safely fall asleep.'

Although, he said, on private property - not public roads - a driver could summon the car remotely.
