A dedicated football fan living in Australia flew 9,500 miles to watch his beloved Southampton FC play for the first time - and saw them win 8-0.

James Thornell, from Melbourne in Australia, travelled for 41 hours to see the 90-minute game of football on Saturday and said it was 'the best day of his life'.

The 30-year-old spent £950 on his flight to Britain having supported the  Premier League team since he saw them play on television as a nine-year-old boy.

Saturday's thumping 8-0 win over Sunderland at Southampton's St Mary's stadium was the first time he had seen them live - and he even caught up with some of the squad afterwards.

The spectacular victory included two own-goals while the club's top scorer this season, Graziano Pelle, scored twice in a result which kept the side third in the league.

Mr Thornell had first watched Southampton on television while living in Australia as a child. On that occasion, they beat Everton 2-0  in 1994 with goals from Ronnie Ekelund and  Matthew Le Tissier - and Mr Thornell has followed them ever since.

After watching his first match in person, he said: 'It was pretty much the best day of my life and it was made all the sweeter for speaking to a few of the players.

'Ryan Bertrand came over and we had a chat for a couple of minutes - he gave me his shirt after hearing where I'd come from.

'Victor Wanyama also did a short video for the Southampton supporters club in Kenya with us which was great.

'It was the most amazing feeling - the whole ground was in shock and awe at what we witnessed.'

Mr Thornell left his home in Melbourne at 5am local time on Friday, took a bus to the airport and then got on his 28-hour flight to London via Brunei and Dubai.

He stepped off the plane at 7.30am on the match day, and got to the ground at noon.

Back at home, Mr Thornell is a member of the Southampton Australia Supporters Club which had just six members at first - but now has more than a thousand.

Last season he made a 3,500km road trip to their annual dinner - over 2,000 miles and 36 hours at the wheel - from Darwin to Adelaide.

He is now staying with a Reading fan in Basingstoke, Hampshire, for two weeks and will also take in Southampton's game against Stoke City on Saturday.

When Southampton steamrollered Sunderland on Saturday it was the first time they had scored eight goals since they trounced Northampton Town by the same margin in December 1921.

Mr Thornell, a sailor in the Australian navy, said: 'My plane fare cost me 1,750 Aussie dollars - about £950.

'It's the second time I've been to the UK, but last time it was two weeks after the end of the Championship promotion season so I couldn't see them play.

'My brother supports Essendon back at home - they are an Aussie Rules team - and we watched the Saints Everton game back in 1994 together.

'He said I'll support Everton because they sound like Essendon and I said I'll support Southampton because that's what it said they were on TV.

'I've supported them ever since. I personally always carry something from Southampton on me. My phone cover is a Saints cover and my house keys are red and white.'
