The Duchess of Cambridge had a 'perfect, natural birth' when she welcomed baby Prince George on July 22nd, the latest issue of Vanity Fair reports.

'She spoke to some of her best girlfriends after the birth and described the birth as perfect,' a source told the October issue of the magazine.

'She said it was straightforward and 
there were no complications. She wanted a natural birth and she was so 
happy she was able to have one.'

And it would seem that the Duchess mirrored her own mother in that regard. George Brown, who has been a close family friend of the Middletons for the past 31 years, told the U.S. glossy that new grandmother Carole had an 'easy and natural' birth when she delivered her own firstborn.

'[It] didn't surprise me,' he said. 
'She was fit and competent from the word go. She seemed to take to 
motherhood amazingly well, and when I went round to see her, she was 
happily breastfeeding and seemed to know exactly what she was doing.

'Catherine
was a lovely little baby, cherubic and chubby-cheeked and so good. I 
remember she didn't cry much at all. I think that was probably because 
Carole was so relaxed.'

'She decided there was no point trying to hide her bump, so she went for a flattering dress that showed off her curves'

The article also sheds light on new 
details surrounding the birth, such as Kate's appearance when she 
entered the hospital in the early hours of the morning (a dark shawl and
her hairl loose around her shoulders) - and how waiting photographers 
decided it would be inappropriate to snap her.

The article also reveals that the Duchess's hairdresser, Amanda Cook Tucker was on standby for the entire month of July.

The hair stylist, who arrived at the 
hospital with an assistant, was also responsible for bringing a 
selection of dresses for Kate to choose from for her first post-baby appearance outside the hospital, the magazine reports.

'She
chose the pale blue spotted Jenny Packham dress that afternoon because 
her tummy was still very rounded and she decided there was no point 
trying to hide her bump, so she went for a flattering dress that showed 
off her curves,' a source said.

They added that the Duchess was 
apparently still very emotional at the time, and 'incredibly nervous' 
about posing for the press, though William was on hand with plenty of 
reassurance.

Now the Cambridges are apparently planning George's christening, which is set to take place in October or November after the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh return from Scotland.

In accordance with tradition, the royal baby will have six godparents, which are likely to include Kate's sister Pippa and William's brother Prince Harry, the article reports.

He will wear a replica of the christening gown worn by Queen Victoria's children as his father and grandmother did, and as the future head of the Church of England, will most likely be christened at Buckingham Palace by the Archbishop of Canterbury like his ancestors.
