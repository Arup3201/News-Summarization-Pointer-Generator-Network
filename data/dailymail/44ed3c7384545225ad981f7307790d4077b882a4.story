The number of confrimed Ebola cases has passed the 10,000 mark according to the World Health Organisation claiming the lives of almost 5,000 people. 

The United Nations health agency warned however that this landmark figure may be inaccurate due to significant under reporting of sickness certain parts of west Africa. 

The WHO fears that many people in the poorest parts of Africa are refusing to come forward for treatment because they are scared.

The World Health Organisation today confirmed that more than 10,000 people have been infected with Ebola

The disease has so far claimed the lives of almost 5,000 people although the figure could be far higher

However, this current outbreak is the largest ever seen. It has hit Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Spain and America. 

As well as a reluctance in coming forward, the WHO complained that there are not enough laboratory capacity to handle the large volume of potentially infected blood samples. This backlog could also lead to an under reporting of the outbreak. 

According to the WHO the number of confirmed, probable and suspected cases of the disease is now 10,141 with 4,922 fatalities. The number of suspected cases has increased by 200 over the past four days. 

On Thursday, authorities confirmed that the disease had spread to Mali, the sixth west African country affected, and on the same day a new case was confirmed in New York, in a doctor recently returned from Guinea.

Mali had long been considered highly vulnerable to the disease, since it shares a border with Guinea. The disease arrived there in a two-year-old, who travelled from Guinea with her grandmother by bus and died yesterday.

Experts feared that Mali was vulnerable to the Ebola as it shares a border with Guinea. Authorities have set up a screening station on the border, but it failed to identify a two-year-old girl who later died of the disease

The United Nations has airlifted more than one tonne of medical supplies into Mali to cope with any outbreak 

The toddler, who was bleeding from her nose during the journey, might have had high-risk contact with many people, the WHO warned. So far, 43 people are being monitored in isolation for signs of the disease, and the WHO said authorities are continuing to look for more people at risk.

The Malian president Ibrahim Boubacar Keita said he will not close the border to Guinea despite the Ebola threat. 

It has emerged that the girl travelled hundreds of kilometres through Mali - including a stop in the capital Bamako - on public transport, potentially exposing many people to the virus, before she died in the western town of Kayes on Friday.

Keita said that the incident showed it was impossible to completely seal his country off from Ebola in neighbouring Guinea but said he remained calm as the girl's journey and potential contacts had already been traced.

He told Frances RFI radio: 'Guinea is Mali's neighbour. We have a shared border that we did not close and we will not close.'

Land-locked Mali relies on the ports of neighbouring Senegal, Guinea and Ivory Coast as gateways for much of its import needs. There is little accurate data but border closures by West African states trying to protect themselves from the epidemic have had a crippling effect on regional economies.

Keita said that the girl's grandmother had made a mistake by going to a funeral in Guinea, where more than 900 people have died of Ebola, and bringing her back.

He said: 'We are paying dearly for this. But I think this will cause more fear than anything else. The case was quickly contained.'

Local and international Ebola experts are rushing teams to Mali to help try to contain the outbreak in the sixth West African nation to record Ebola this year. Senegal and Nigeria have contained outbreaks and been declared free of the disease. 

Diplomats and health experts say the girl appears to have had Ebola-like symptoms and travelled for four days before she was eventually diagnosed with the disease on October 23. Ebola cases are contagious as soon as they show symptoms.

The World Health Organisation said that 43 contacts had been identified and isolated. But a Malian health official, who asked not to be identified, said authorities estimated that at least 300 people had been in contact with the infected child.

Keita added: 'We will do everything we can to avoid panic. I notice that Bamako is calm today.'

To help fight Ebola, the UN humanitarian flight service airlifted about a tonne of medical supplies to Mali late yesterday. The seats of the plane were removed to make room for the cargo, which included hazard suits for health workers, surgical gloves, face shields and buckets, according to the World Food Programme, which runs the flights.

Denise Brown, west Africa regional director with the UN food agency said: 'Speed is of the essence in this Ebola crisis. Agencies such as WFP and WHO are working every hour to confront together the virus as a matter of priority.'

New York and New Jersey have implemented stringent quarantine restrictions for suspected new cases 

In the United States, a women who arrived on a flight to New Jersey from west Africa showing symptoms of the disease has tested negative to Ebola. 

New Jersey Department of Health said the woman remains under observation and in isolation at University Hospital in Newark. She is a health care worker who arrived yesterday from west Africa, where she had contact with Ebola patients.

She initially showed no symptoms of the virus but later developed a fever.

The woman, who arrived at Newark Liberty International Airport, became the first traveller to be quarantined under an Ebola watch in New York and New Jersey.

The governors of those states had announced a mandatory 21-day quarantine of medical workers and other airline passengers who have had contact with Ebola victims.

The move came after a doctor who returned to New York City a week ago from treating Ebola patients in Guinea fell ill with the virus. Many New Yorkers were dismayed to learn that in the days after he came home, Craig Spencer travelled on the subway system, took a taxi, went bowling, visited a coffee shop and ate at a restaurant in the city of eight million.

New Jersey governor Chris Christie and New York's Andrew Cuomo said the case led them to conclude that the two states needed precautions more rigorous than those of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.

The CDC recommends monitoring of exposed people for 21 days but does not require quarantine.

Mr Cuomo said: 'It's too serious a situation to leave it to the honour system of compliance.'
