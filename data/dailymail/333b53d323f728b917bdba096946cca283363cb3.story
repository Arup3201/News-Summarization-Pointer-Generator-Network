A teenage thug who taunted officers with a 'Catch Me If You Can' message after they posted an online appeal to find him has been caught.

Logan Rhys James, 19, of Caerphilly, South Wales, was released from prison after being sentenced to eight months behind bars for a street knife attack but breached his licence less than a week later by failing to keep contact with police. He has now been recalled to prison.

Gwent Police posted an appeal for information with a picture of James on their Facebook page, only for the teenager to post a comment which said: 'catch me if you can won't see me slipping'.

But the teenager is now in police custody after being caught in Caerphilly today. 

Logan Rhys James taunted police with a 'catch me if you can' message after they posted an appeal for information about him because he breached his licence less than a week after being released 

Gwent Police said: ‘Officers searching for Logan Rhys James, from the Caerphilly area, who breached his licence conditions after being released from prison on 6th February 2015 have arrested him.

‘The 19-year-old was arrested in Caerphilly at about 5.20pm this evening. He is currently in police custody.’

James received an eight month sentence for actual bodily harm, affray, common assault and being in possession of a knife and was released early from prison earlier this month.

He was released from prison on February 6 but was recalled after falling off the police radar just a week after his release from prison on licence after he failed to show up at a probation meeting.

James had been released early after serving part of an eight month sentence for a street knife attack 

Speaking from an unknown location near his family home in Caerphilly, South Wales, he said: 'They are not going to be able to catch me - I won't let them.

'They have been round my mum's house four times a day but I'll be out for at least a month or two before the get me.

'I have only been out for a week so I wont to be out a bit longer before going back in.

'I'm still near my home and I haven't seen any police yet. I have been walking around near home so they're not trying too hard to catch me.' 

The teenager has boasted that he plans to be out at least a month or two before officers catch up with him
