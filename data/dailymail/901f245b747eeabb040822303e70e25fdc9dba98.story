One of America's first and longest-standing female news anchors has celebrated her 45th year on the job.

Jean Enersen landed a role at KING5, an NBC-affiliated television station located in Seattle, Washington, in 1968 at a time when men ruled the airwaves.

The lithe blonde, 69, previously explained to seattlepi.com that when she first went to work for the network she frequently encountered sexism.

Sustained career: Jean Enersen, one of America's first and longest-standing female news anchors has celebrated her 45th year on the job - here she is pictured on air in 1975

'I was told if I drank a shot of whiskey before going on air I might be able to lower my voice. Others suggested I take up smoking,' she recalled.

At the time women advancing in the field believed that speaking in a lower register would made a better impression on viewers, who were more used to male reporters.

On another occasion she said that a cameraman was so insulted to be paired with a woman, he refused to shoot the story they were set to work on.

But
determined, she 'fought her own battles' and eventually 
made a name for herself on the broadcasting circuit, winning 
several Emmy awards for her work.

On the hunt for a story: Ms Enersen says that during her career she's been able to do 'a lot of firsts' and in 1987 she was one of the few American journalists to be asked to report in the Soviet Union before it dissolved

Talking about her illustrious career recently on the Today Show Ms Enersen explained that she's been able to do 'a lot of firsts' and witness a plethora of historical events first-hand.

As a twenty-something she led the first U.S. broadcasting crew to China after Richard Nixon resumed trade relations.

And later, was one of the few American journalists to be asked to report in the Soviet Union before it dissolved.

'In terms of broadcasting, there's so many other devices people get their news on . . . things have changed a lot'

Some of the famous figures she's 
interviewed include Oprah Winfrey, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill 
Gates and most recently Barack Obama.

Her former boss, Pat Costello told the Seattle Times: 'She's our go-to person.

'If there's a big interview out there, 
we would like Jean to do it. When Warren Buffett and Bill Gates were in 
town, we wanted Jean.'

Asked what's been the most important thing that's happened for her since starting at KING5 at the age of 24, Ms Enersen touched on technological advancements.

'In terms of broadcasting, I think there's so many other 
devices that people get their news on,' she explained on Today, adding that 'things 
have changed a lot.'

Not stopping yet: At 69, it appears that she has no intention of retiring and continues to host regular broadcasts

The thrice-married mother-of-two says that her real passion is educating people about health matters, particularly breast cancer.

'We need to reach women who don't go to doctors except in emergencies and convince them to take advantage of a free testing opportunity,' she said.

Approaching 70, it appears that she has no intention of retiring and continues to host regular weeknight broadcasts with her co-anchor Dennis Bounds.

'KING5 is a great TV station,' she concluded during her Today interview.
