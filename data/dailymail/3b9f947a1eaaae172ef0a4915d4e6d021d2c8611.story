Zlatan Ibrahimovic returned from injury to score a hat-trick for Paris Saint Germain's in their 5-0 victory over St Etienne  on Sunday evening.

The Sweden international has been sidelined for two weeks with an abdominal strain but showed no ill effects as he put three past the visitors with a variety of finishes at the Parc des Princes.

Without their talisman, PSG had only managed five points from their opening three games and were languishing in 12th position before this result moved them up to joint second place behind leaders Bordeaux.

The scoring was opened in comical style, when a back pass from St Etienne's Clement slipped under the foot of keeper Stéphane Ruffier for an own goal.

Ibrahimovic opened his account in the first-half when he held off Florentin Pogba - whose brother Paul was watching from the stands - to meet Maxwell's cross with a bullet header. 

The 32-year-old netted twice more in the second half - either side of a strike from Edinson Cavani -by slotting the ball beneath the beleaguered Ruiffier with different finishes   to complete the rout and a memorable comeback.

Alexandre Lacazette gave Lyon the lead midway through the second half, but a penalty from Yeni Ngbakoto levelled up and Juan Manuel Falcon poached a late winner for the home side.

Visitors Lyon have now lost three on the trot after starting with a win over Rennes. 

Bordeaux's impressive 100 per cent start to the season came to an end on Sunday with a 1-1 draw against Bastia at the Stade Chaban-Delmas.

Junior Tallo's first-half strike, his second of the campaign, seemed like giving Claude Makelele's men their second consecutive 1-0 Ligue 1 win before Diego Rolan broke Corsican hearts with little over 10 minutes left.
