A judge has ruled that there is enough evidence to send a Salt Lake City pediatrician to trial for the murder of his ex-wife.

Following two days of testimony, Utah Third District Court Judge Robin Reese made the decision today that John Brickman Wall, 49, will stand trial for the 2011 murder of Uta von Schwedler.

The state medical examiner ruled that von Schwedler, 49, died from drowning as well as fatal amount of Xanax, and said this week he could not determine whether her death was a homicide or suicide, but could be certain that it was not accidental.

Respected doctor: John Brickman Wall appeared withdrawn as he entered court for his preliminary hearing in the case of his ex-wife's death

Horror: Uta von Schwedler, a mother of four, was found dead in her bathtub in September 2011 with a knife under her body and blood splattered nearby

Police called the death suspicious 
when it occurred in September 2011 but no charges were filed against 
Wall until April of this year.

Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said there wasn’t one single piece of evidence that finally led to the charges.

Instead,
he said, a combination of factors played a role, including DNA evidence
under the victim’s fingernails that didn’t rule out Wall; the fact that
von Schwedler died in part due to an overdose of Xanax but didn’t have a
prescription and was not depressed; and Wall’s inability to explain his
whereabouts the night of her death.

Trial: Brickman Wall will face first-degree felony counts of murder and aggravated burglary in connection with the October 2011 death of his ex-wife, Uta Von Schwedler

The body of Uta von Schwedler, 49, was discovered in an overflowing bathtub in her home on 27 September 2011.

A knife was found under her body, and she had cuts and abrasions not consistent with suicide.

Police said there was evidence of a struggle, and that the crime scene looked posed.

An
autopsy revealed von Schwedler also had a large amount of Xanax in her 
system at the time of her death - a drug she was not known to take and 
for which she did not have a prescription.

According
to the Deseret News, the prosecution told the court that Wall did have a
prescription for Xanax, and that he also made out a prescription for 
his mother for a large dose of the drug, which was filled shortly before von 
Schwedler's death.

Both
the prosecution and the defense had myriad theories as to how the drugs
came to be in von Schwedler's system, including the possibility that 
Wall injected Von Schwedler with the drug, and that he used his skills 
as a doctor to persuade her to take it.

The
prosecution told the court that all evidence points towards Wall being
in the house at the time of his ex-wife's death, and that the doctor 
had a motive.

Police found blood stains and overturned objects in the victim’s bedroom. The 
back door had been unlocked, prosecutors say, and a key was missing from
its hiding place.

In addition, a family friend told police John Wall was driving in the area at about 7am on the day of the killing.

Charging documents indicate police interviewed about 30 people while investigating the killing.

Wall will return to court on October 21 to face first-degree felony charges of murder and aggravated burglary and is expected to plead not guilty.

Beloved: von Schwedler was a brilliant scientist who specialized in DNA and HIV research

Wall and von Schwedler had been involved in a bitter custody 
battle over their four children after divorcing in 2006.

Their son, Pelle Wall, 19, testified at a custody 
hearing that he was so afraid of his father when he was living with him 
that he slept with a pellet gun and a knife.

Following
an interview with police, the documents state, John Wall told a friend,
'Only a monster would do what was done to Uta. If it was me, I don’t 
remember.'

Today judge Robin Reese supported his decision to send Wall to trial, saying that Wall had developed a deep anger and hatred for his ex-wife over a long period of time.

The judge said that it 'seems unusual [Wall] couldn’t tell police, friends and neighbors that he didn’t kill his ex.'
