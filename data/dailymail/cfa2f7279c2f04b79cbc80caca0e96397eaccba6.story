Rapper Chris Brown's entourage got into a bottle-throwing fight with a nearby group at New York nightclub, according to a police source

Rapper Chris Brown's entourage got into a bottle-throwing brawl with a nearby group at a New York nightclub, according to a police source.

The alleged incident took place last night at the Meatpacking District’s VIP Room where Brown was hosting a New York Fashion Week after-party.

One man who was hit by flying glass is in a stable condition with a serious eye injury at Beth Israel Hospital, the source said, according to the New York Daily News.

Police, who arrived at the club at 3:20am, are investigating the incident, but there are no immediate arrests. 

Law enforcement sources told TMZ that they are not sure the 25-year-old singer was directly involved, but a witness told the website Brown was in a VIP section of the club when the brawl broke out.

Two years ago Brown was directly involved in a similar brawl with Drake and his crew at W.i.P. Nightclub in NYC thought to be over popstar Rihanna.

Last month music mogul Suge Knight was shot at a pre-VMA party hosted by Chris Brown at an LA nightclub.

The 49-year-old was treated for six shotgun wounds at hospital and two others, including 19-year-old model Megan Hawkins, were also shot - all three were rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.

Earlier this month Brown pleaded guilty to punching a man in the face outside a Washington hotel, an assault that occurred while the singer was on probation for attacking his then-girlfriend Rihanna.

Brown pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and was sentenced to time served.

He spent two days in a District of Columbia jail in the case, one that further tarnished the image of the Grammy-winning singer.

Brown admitted that he hit a man who tried to get in a picture the singer was taking with two women outside the W hotel a few blocks from the White House last October.

The victim, Parker Adams, suffered a broken nose. 

At the time of the arrest, Brown was on probation in a felony assault case for attacking pop star Rihanna hours before the 2009 Grammy awards. 

The arrest led a judge in California to revoke his probation, and he was ordered in May to serve an additional 131 days in jail.

Brown had a squeaky-clean image before his attack on Rihanna, but since then he has had several flare-ups that have been reported to authorities and noted by Los Angeles prosecutors.

Brown broke a window after a 2011 'Good Morning America' interview in New York and was accused of snatching a woman's cellphone in Miami after she tried to snap pictures of the singer. 

He was also slightly injured in a New York nightclub brawl and, earlier this year, was accused of being involved in a fistfight with Frank Ocean's entourage over a parking spot at a West Hollywood recording studio.

He was not charged in any of the incidents, but they have hurt his public standing. 

Nonetheless, legions of fans, including many of his more than 13 million Twitter followers, continue to support him. 

Following the hearing, he tweeted '#XTheAlbum,' a reference to his new recording, due out Sept. 16.

Onorato said his client has learned to 'be more judicious' in his dealings with the public. 

Brown's bodyguard, Christopher Hollosy, was convicted of misdemeanor assault in April for his role in the same scuffle. 

He has not yet been sentenced. 

The victim, Adams, has also filed a $1.5 million lawsuit against Brown and Hollosy.
