End of life care is ‘unacceptable’ at too many NHS hospitals, a damning report warns, with the problem especially serious at weekends.

Only a fifth of hospitals had specialist palliative care staff on duty on Saturdays and Sundays according to experts, despite official guidance demanding seven-day care ten years ago.

Around three-quarters offer face-to-face palliative care on weekdays only. However, the report found one in four fail to provide a decent quality of service at any time.

The report’s authors said it was unacceptable that so many patients were dying ‘badly’ when hospitals know how they should be cared for.

The major audit recommends that  people who are dying in hospital should get access to palliative care from at least 9am to 5pm seven days a week.

It found that NHS staff told fewer than half of patients in the final days of life that the end was near, with almost one in ten families kept in the dark.

It also found a fifth of hospitals are failing to give any special training to staff caring for the dying.

Important decisions about whether to withdraw artificial hydration or nutrition were seldom discussed with patients capable of doing so, with barely one in six (17 per cent) being involved. Although family members were included more often, the audit found almost two-thirds never got to talk to staff about these issues.

The National Care of the Dying Audit for Hospitals, led by the Royal College of Physicians and the Marie Curie Palliative Care Institute, found significant variations in provision, quality and training of end-of-life care.

The audit of a sample of 6,580 people who died in 149 NHS hospitals in England was carried out last May. It also contained the views of 858 bereaved relatives or friends and an analysis of the organisation of palliative care in the selected hospitals.

The report comes after the Liverpool Care Pathway – a ‘tick-box exercise’ used for care of the dying in hundreds of hospitals – was condemned in July by a national inquiry and Government ministers.

Senior medical figures raised fears the system was being used to kill off unwanted patients, free hospital beds and save money.

The new audit makes ten recommendations, including the need for palliative care from 9am to 5pm seven days a week and mandatory training in care of the dying for staff.

Dr Kevin Stewart, the chairman of the audit steering group, said many staff fail to communicate properly with dying people or their loved ones and hospitals ‘do not recognise this as an important issue’.

Professor John Ellershaw, director of the Marie Curie Palliative Care Institute in Liverpool, said: ‘It is unacceptable in the current day and age that hospitals are failing patients, and their families, in the care they receive at the end of their life. Too many patients are dying badly in our hospitals when we know how to care for them well.’

Claire Henry, the chief executive of the National Council for Palliative Care, said: ‘There can be no excuse for hospitals failing to treat people with dignity, compassion and respect when they are dying, at the time that they most need this.’

Neglected:  Helen Weldon, 85, was only due to be in Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham for a routine check-up after being admitted to A&E for choking on some water

Helen Weldon, 85, who had been admitted to Birmingham Heartlands Hospital after choking on some water, was found by her son and daughter when they visited over August bank holiday weekend in 2010.

Anastasia and Jimmy Weldon spoke out after an inquest last week heard that a grandmother, Joan James, 85, had been dead for more than half an hour at the same hospital before her family discovered her.

When Mrs Weldon’s children visited they  discovered her to be cold with food dried to her mouth. It took nurses a further 20 minutes to come over to check her pulse.

Miss Weldon, 45, said: ‘As soon as I walked through the door and saw my mum I knew something wasn’t right. She was yellow and her skin was waxy. The starched water in the glass next to her bed had set like wallpaper paste, so she must have been lying there for at least two hours.’

And in a third case a grieving sister said she found her brother lying dead just moments after a ward sister claimed to have checked on him at Heartlands in June 2012.

Linda Webb, 65, said the nurse claimed her brother Christopher was feeling ‘a bit better this morning’ – but she found him lying in bed with his face covered in blood as if he had been there  ‘for a while’.

Heartlands Hospital yesterday apologised to the families but said it was not able to comment on whether an inquiry would be carried out into the incidents.
