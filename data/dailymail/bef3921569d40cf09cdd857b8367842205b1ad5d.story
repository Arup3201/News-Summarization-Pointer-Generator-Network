Hustler: Bronx beggar Eddie Wise, 51, was found dead in his apartment by his wife in January

The self-professed 'original hustler' who became New York City's most famous beggar when he sued NYPD to defend his right to peacefully panhandle has died.

Eddie Wise's wife Sharon Persaud found him dead, by himself and bleeding from the nose, in January in the East 158th St basement they shared.

A medical examiner said the 
51-year-old died of a brain-stem hemorrhage caused by acute cocaine 
intoxication and hypertensive cardiovascular disease.

'Eddie was a good man,' widow Persaud, 37, told the New York Post.

'He worked hard; he was always cheerful. A lot of people didn’t give him a chance.

'This time, he wanted a better life.

'We planned on leaving New York and buying a house. We had high hopes, but they never came through.'

Wise
 was the lead plaintiff in a 2005 class action accusing the NYPD of 
arresting thousands of people across the state under an anti-panhandling
 law ruled unconstitutional in 1992, the Daily News reported.

Fed up with being jailed 27 times for
 hustling and saving parking spaces for drivers for a small fee, the 
Bronx bum approached a Legal Aid lawyer he knew in 2004.

Wise asked whether he could sue the cops, and she hooked him up with a legal team.

It
 turned out he had a case, with the suit claiming at least 140 
panhandlers were improperly charged in 2003 and 2004, most of them in 
the Bronx.

In December 2006, the city agreed to pay Wise $100,000 if he dropped his complaint.

Last
 year New York City paid out $15 million to settle the lawsuit brought 
by thousands more people unconstitutionally charged for loitering, 
according to the Wall Street Journal.

While Wise was instrumental in driving the city's largest legal payout, he failed to make the most of his own share.

The New York Post reports the Harlem-born man was penniless when he died, squandering most of his fortune on drugs.

'Everybody in the neighborhood is thinking that . . . I’m going to be broke pretty soon,” Wise, then 45, told New York magazine in 2007.

'I got to prove to myself that I know how to handle this money. One hundred thousand dollars ain’t no joke.'

He went back to hustling shortly after his cash windfall, allegedly wasting many other opportunities to build a new life.

He reportedly began using cocaine after being discharged from the National Guard for a heart murmur shortly after graduating.

He was a deliveryman in the 1990s and scored a settlement of tens of thousands after injuring his hand, but blew it on cocaine.

Wise was arrested at least 52 times, on charges that included felony crack possession, violating an order of protection and assaulting a woman.

Wise left behind 3-year-old daughter Montice and son Cody, born last month.

He also had a 16-year-old son with another woman, who said Wise disappeared after the settlement, according to the New York Post.
