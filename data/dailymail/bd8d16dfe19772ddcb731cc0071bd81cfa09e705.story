An embarrassed local official and an adopted local hero left their unique marks on the Chinese Grand Prix.

The identity of the first, a marshal who waved the chequered flag a lap early, was being concealed for his own sanity.

The second was Lewis Hamilton, whose name is reverberating ever more profoundly across this World Championship.

He drove his Mercedes flawlessly to 
victory from pole position, prompting a huge cheer from surprisingly 
well-populated stands to ring out above the burr of the new turbo 
engines.

'I'm in the 
happiest mood that I can remember,' said Hamilton. 'It's where I am in 
my life, family, girlfriend, all things, where I live, everything, 
having the right people in place, management, being in the right team.'

Nothing went wrong all weekend for Hamilton. Off the track, he enjoyed 
the adulation of his fans at the airport, at the track and at his hotel 
'every morning, every evening, day and night'. They even gave him a 
digital photo frame with a specially-made video.

Psychological blow: Hamilton left title rival Rosberg trailing as he claimed his third win of the campaign

On
 the track, he drove supremely in qualifying through the gloom and 
drizzle to set himself up for yesterday's demonstration that took him to
 25 career wins.

The 
total took him past the immortal Juan Manuel Fangio and level with his 
Mercedes boss Niki Lauda and the British great Jim Clark.

As
 coincidence would have it, on Clark's 25th and sadly final victory, in 
Kyalami, South Africa on January 1, 1968, the chequered flag was also 
waved prematurely but the Scot was awake to the fact and raced on.

Hamilton lifted, he said, for a second-and-a-half but was told by the 
team to keep going. The regulations, bizarrely, dictate that if the flag is waved early, the placings are taken from the preceding lap.

That
 meant Caterham's Kamui Kobayashi's last overtaking move on Marussia 
Jules Bianchi did not count. Thankfully, they were contesting 17th place
 rather than the important positions at the front.

Trailing: Kimi Raikkonen in the Ferrari was well down the leaderboard at the Shanghai International Circuit

Another
 consolation of sorts for the unnamed marshal is that the last 
flag-related error of this sort was committed by none other than Pele. 
He had to be prompted to wave the flag in Brazil in 2006 after the 
winning Ferrari of Felipe Massa had already whizzed by.

In
 second place here was Hamilton's Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg. His 
telemetry failed before the race even started, so he had to think for 
himself rather than rely on his team's analysis.

Having
 made a poor start as a result of his problems, slipping from fourth on 
the grid to seventh on the first lap, he bided his time coolly, 
squeezing up the field gradually. It was impressive in the circumstances.

Fernando
 Alonso, of Ferrari, drove pugnaciously to a third place that probably 
flattered his car. Given that Hamilton has won three consecutive races -
 a feat he had never achieved before - it is amazing that Rosberg 
nevertheless holds a four-point lead in the championship table, by dint 
of his own consistency and Hamilton's mechanical failure in the opening 
round in Melbourne.

Spectacle: Fans in the main grandstand take pictures of the start

The
 most controversial aspect of Sunday's racing came when Sebastian Vettel
 was ordered to give way to his Red Bull team-mate Daniel Ricciardo. 

The world champion was nonplussed and asked what strategy Ricciardo was on. 'Tough luck,' was Vettel's response when told.

Defiantly he refused to yield for a couple of laps before finally making room for his supposedly junior partner to pass.

Christian Horner, who had worn an anxious expression as the drama 
unfolded, excused his star driver afterwards, saying: 'He hasn't won 
four world championships by not being a racer. Of course, he's going to 
question the instruction to understand it, but as soon as he understood 
the reasoning, bang, he moved aside.'

Aussie rules: Daniel Ricciardo finished 25 seconds clear of Vettel

Did he? Should he have questioned it all? Should Red Bull have employed
 team orders so readily? The most surprising thing of all though is that
 Vettel was again slower than Ricciardo. It was the second time he has 
been asked to move aside in consecutive races. Whither the boy genius?

Horner
 said: 'He's not getting the feedback from the car that he wants. The 
compound effect is that he's damaging the tyres more, which is very 
unusual for Seb. As soon as we have worked those out then I'm sure he'll
 be back with a bang.'

Red
 Bull and McLaren are heading for a legal dispute over the 
aerodynamicist Dan Fallows, who left Red Bull, seemingly agreed to join 
McLaren and then turned up again at Red Bull. It is a point of 
principle, no doubt, for McLaren chairman Ron Dennis, who watched his 
cars driven by Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen finish in 11th and 13th
 places. They are slipping back.

No so their old boy, Hamilton, who had China in his hands and the world at his feet.

On the three previous occasions Lewis Hamilton triumphed in three straight races — Formula Renault in 2003, Formula Three in 2005, and GP2 a year later — he went on to win the title.

KIMI'S TRAILING

Kimi Raikkonen continues to be blown away by fellow former world champion Fernando Alonso following his high-profile move back to Ferrari. 

The surly Finn has managed just eight laps ahead of Alonso this season and finished Sunday’s race 50 seconds adrift of his Spanish team-mate.

No driver has won a Formula One world championship without winning one of the first four grands prix. That’s a strong omen for Hamilton and Nico Rosberg; not so for Sebastian Vettel and the chasing pack.
