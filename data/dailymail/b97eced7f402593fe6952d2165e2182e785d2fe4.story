This map reveals the damage alcohol is causing around the country.

With soaring rates of hospital admissions - and alcohol-related liver disease - a new study has mapped how much Britons in each region are drinking – and how many are dying as a result.

It found Central Scotland is the booze capital of Britain, with residents drinking 20.9 units a week, the equivalent of almost two bottles of wine and a shot.

The alcohol consumption for this area of Scotland – which includes Glasgow and Dundee  - is 18 per cent higher than the national average.

This map shows the alcohol hotspots of Great Britain. The boxes reveal how many units of alcohol per week are drunk by residents in the area, and how many alcohol related deaths per 100,000 adults in the area. The study found Scotland and the South West drank the most units, while London and the East of England drank the least 

More people die of alcohol related deaths than in any other region, with 24.5 deaths per 100,000 population.

This is more than double the rate for London, which had the lowest rate of 9.4 alcohol-related deaths per 100,000 population.

The study, by NHS Health Scotland, was the first to analyse alcohol sales data, an indicator of alcohol consumption, as well as alcohol-related deaths.

It found people in the South West, Central Scotland, North East, North West and Yorkshire were the biggest boozers, with higher levels of alcohol sales per adult than the average for Great Britain.

There were lower sales of alcohol in London, Central England and the East of England, the study found.

The high volume of sales in South West England (19 per cent higher than the national average) was mostly due to spirits and cider sold through pubs and restaurants, but sales of wine through supermarkets and other off-licences were also high.

However while the South West region had the joint highest consumption level, it had one of the lowest alcohol death rates.

Researchers at NHS Health Scotland and the Glasgow Centre for Population Health suggested that this could be due to tourism.

The South West, which was defined by the study as mainly Devon and Cornwall, had one of the smallest populations but also one of the highest rates of second homes.

People who visit this area but do not live there would increase the sales figures for alcohol and would not show up for alcohol-related deaths.

And the stereotype about Scots and their love of whisky rang true, as both Scottish regions, but particularly Central Scotland, had substantially higher spirits sales than any other region, especially through off-licenses.

In Yorkshire and the northern English regions, more beer was sold per adult than in any other region, with the drink accounting for 46 per cent of the market share for alcohol here.

The biggest wine drinkers reside in the South and in South West England, with 35 per cent of the market share of wine sold here.

The low volume of sales in London was because of lower sales through off-licences.

It was also found that regions with higher sales per adult typically had higher rates of alcohol-related deaths.

NHS officials warn death rates linked to alcohol-related liver disease have risen 'considerably' over the last few decades.

Liver disease kills 11,000 people a year in England, despite the fact that major causes such as alcohol misuse and obesity are preventable.

The lower limits for safe drinking recommended by doctors are set at 21 units for men and 14 for women.

A small 125ml glass of 13 per cent wine contains 1.6 units, while a regular 4 per cent pint of lager contains 2.3 units.

A 25ml single 40 per cent spirit and mixer contains one unit, while a 275ml bottle of 5.5 per cent alcopop contains 1.5 units.

All previous studies have looked at alcohol consumption for regions in Great Britain based on self-reported data, which can be biased because of low response rates, the sample taken not being representative, and because people do not accurately report how much they drank.

The use of alcohol sales data is a more accurate and objective way to estimate how much the country is really drinking.

However, researchers warned this data is still subject to its own biases, such as wastage and spillage; consumption by tourists; and unrecorded alcohol, which includes homebrew, smuggled alcohol and alcohol intended for industrial and medical use.

The study's lead Mark Robinson, of NHS Health Scotland, said: 'Our study provides support for the relationship between alcohol consumption and alcohol-related mortality across regions in Great Britain, which hasn't always been the case using survey data to estimate consumption.

'Future studies should consider the use of data from a range of different sources to provide a better understanding of alcohol consumption in GB, its relationship with alcohol-related harms, and the impact of different alcohol policy approaches.'

The results were published in the journal BMC Public Health.
