Nick Clegg today piled pressure on disgraced former colleague Chris Huhne to repay the £17,000 payout he received after quitting the Cabinet to fight criminal charges.

The Deputy Prime Minister said Huhne had to 'pay amends' after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice over speeding points a decade ago.

Mr Clegg will today call the by-election in Huhne’s Eastleigh seat on February 28 – far earlier than expected – amid Lib Dem jitters that it could fall to their coalition partners.

Disgraced: The by-election for one-time Energy Secretary Chris Huhne's (seen leaving his home in London today) former Eastleigh seat will take place at the end of this month

Mr Clegg fired the starting gun on his campaign today 
with a savage attack on the Conservatives over their failure to agree to
a mansion tax on expensive homes, while claiming sole credit for 
cutting the income tax bill for more than 60,000 basic rate taxpayers in
Eastleigh.

He used the major speech of the by-election contest to accuse the Tories of demanding a tax cut for millionaires while he battled to cut tax bills for low and middle earners.

But during his weekly radio phone-in he was repeatedly challenged over Huhne's dramatic fall from grace, and the £17,000 he received after leaving the Cabinet a year ago when he was charged by police.

When pressed, Mr Clegg eventually said the public would expect Huhne to give the money back to the taxpayer.

'I totally understand why people think that now he has pleaded guilty and when he is sentenced that he should pay amends for what’s happened,' he said on LBC 97.3.

'But at the end of the day Chris has got to make that decision I don’t yet know what sentence the judge is going to hand down to him.'

Rivalry: Huhne and Nick Clegg clashed during the 2007 leadership to succeed Sir Menzies Campbell

In his speech, Mr Clegg revived the prospect of a mansion tax to target wealthy home owners.

He said his 'preferred option' was a 1 per cent levy on properties worth more than £2million, applied just to the value over and above £2m.

Alternatively he proposed new council tax bands at the 'top end' levied on properties worth over £2million.

Mr Clegg said: 'Both of these options are based on a very simple principle: That we should ask a small number of very wealthy individuals to make a reasonable contribution, in order to provide desperately needed help for millions of ordinary people.

'Nothing could do more to demonstrate a commitment to greater fairness in our tax system. It’s an open secret that our Conservative partners do not share our views on this.

'However, we will continue to make this argument, in this Coalition and beyond.  Our approach is simple: taxes on mansions; tax cuts for millions. An approach to tax that puts payslips before palaces, if you like.'

The by-election contest is likely to be one of the most hotly-contested in recent years, with two governing parties going head-to-head.

Both Mr Clegg and David Cameron know that victory for their party would help settle complaints about their leadership, and defeat will raise serious doubts about their hopes at the 2015 general election.

Lib Dems insisted their decision, as the sitting party in the constituency, to opt for a short contest reflected the high state of preparedness of the local party, even though they have yet to choose a candidate.

'We are going to throw the kitchen sink at it. I'm pretty sure that the Conservatives will as well,' one source said.

Speculation: It is thought Maria Hutchings may stand for the Conservatives in Chris Huhne's former seat

'It is going to be a tight contest, and generally in tight contests in two-way marginals you get some pretty robust exchanges.'

However, the Conservatives have 
indicated that they intend to relentlessly highlight Huhne's record, who
quit the Commons on Monday after pleading 
guilty to perverting the course of justice after years of denials.

Conservative chairman Grant Shapps 
told the Mail: ‘The residents of Eastleigh have for a long time been 
sold a lie by their Lib Dem MP. That’s why they’ll welcome the 
opportunity to express the way they feel about it very soon.

‘Conservatives will present the 
opportunity to start afresh with a hard-working local MP who gets on 
with looking after her constituents.’

It is understood that the Tories will formally select local mother Maria Hutchings, their candidate in 
2010, to fight the seat again.

She famously confronted Tony Blair over cuts 
to special schools in the 2005 election campaign.

Her chances of success have been boosted by UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage’s decision not to stand.

Labour sources are hoping for a strong showing, but are thought to privately accept they have little chances of winning.

But Lib Dem chief whip Alistair 
Carmichael will today move the writ to trigger a by-election in 
Eastleigh in just over three weeks – before the party has even selected a
candidate.

Former Lib Dem frontbencher Dr Evan 
Harris, who fronts the Hacked Off campaign for a press law, last night 
ruled himself out, as has Lib Dem council leader Keith House.

A Tory victory in Eastleigh, which 
would require a 3.5 per cent swing, would be a shattering blow for Mr 
Clegg. No prime minister since Margaret Thatcher at the height of her 
Falklands popularity has managed to gain a seat in a by-election.
