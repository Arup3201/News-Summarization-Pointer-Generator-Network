A mysterious vampire slaying kit - complete with holy water, a mallet and a set of wooden stakes - is going on show in a new exhibition dedicated to the strange and supernatural world of the gothic.

The ghoulish box, which also includes a crucifix, rosary beads and a pistol, is part of a new exhibition at the British Library in central London which opens tomorrow.

Some believe the kits date back to Victorian times, with others saying they are more modern - and inspired by the famous Hammer Horror films.

Curator Greg Buzwell said: 'They really do exist and we're very fortunate and lucky to have this. 

'Every component you see in there dates from the Victorian era so you've got the mallet, the stakes, the crucifix and the holy water, etc.

'But there is a mystery around them. There is no real evidence of them existing prior to about 1970.'

Mr Buzwell said he could only speculate as to how many were made and for whom.  

'There are 60 or 70 of them thought to be in existence. We think probably a lot of them were maybe made for eccentric collectors.

'Others maybe were made on the back of the Hammer film adaptations and the renewed popularity of the vampire story but one or two of them may actually be genuine survivals from the Victorian era.'

Other exhibits include Dracula author Bram Stoker's manuscript of his adaptation of his vampire novel for the stage and a letter said to have been written by Jack the Ripper.

The document, known as the Dear Boss letter, was sent to a journalist in 1888 and written in red ink.

It included details of the infamous serial killer's attacks and experts have long debated whether it is a hoax or not.

Also on show are gothic-inspired fashion by Alexander McQueen and a series of pictures by photographer Martin Parr taken during the regular gathering of goths in Whitby, in north Yorkshire, where key scenes from Stoker's novel are set.

The exhibition's lead curator Tim Pye said: 'Gothic is one of the most popular and influential modes of literature and I'm delighted that Terror and Wonder is celebrating its rich 250 year history.

'The exhibition features an amazingly wide range of material, from stunningly beautiful medieval artefacts to vinyl records from the early goth music scene, so there is truly something for everyone'.

Terror and Wonder: The Gothic Imagination runs until January 20.
