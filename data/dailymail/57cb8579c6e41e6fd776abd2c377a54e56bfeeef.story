David Cameron was shoved in the street by a member of the public this morning in a 'very significant security breach' - sparking an immediate inquiry by Scotland Yard.

The Prime Minister was in Leeds to promote the Government's proposed high speed railway line. But as he came out of the city's Civic Hall a passing jogger ran up to him at speed forcing Mr Cameron to move out of the way while his surrounding security team look on.

Within hours the Metropolitan Police commissioner Bernard Hogan Howe had ordered an investigation into how the man was allowed to get so close to the PM. 

It comes less than a week after a lone-wolf gunman killed a soldier before attacking the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa.

This afternoon jogger Dean Balboa Farley revealed he was the man who managed to run into Mr Cameron without being stopped by his security squad.

The 28-year-old complained this afternoon he merely 'brushed' the Prime Minister only to be 'assaulted by half a dozen coppers in suits'.

The Metropolitan Police Specialist Protection Command and West Yorkshire Police will conduct a review of the 'incident', Scotland Yard said.

A spokesman said: 'The Metropolitan Police Service is aware of an incident in Leeds today, Monday, 27 October, involving a 28-year-old man and the Prime Minister as he left the Civic Hall.

'The man was arrested by local officers and was later de-arrested. The MPS Specialist Protection Command is responsible for the personal protection of the Prime Minister and will now conduct a review of the incident in consultation with West Yorkshire Police.' 

Mr Cameron spotted the man running up to him and took a step back and to the left before security noticed and bundled the protester to the floor.

The PM did not fall over and calmly walked to his waiting car before being driven away from the scene uninjured. 

One witness said Mr Cameron 'sidestepped' the man in a 'lovely little move'. The jogger had crossed the pavement towards the Prime Minister, clutching a white towel. 

Police took the 28-year-old man away. He was arrested but later released. West Yorkshire Police said that no threat had been made, adding: 'Nothing sinister, just a man in the wrong place at the wrong time.'

But Conservative MP Mark Pritchard demanded a full investigation into how the Metropolitan Police security team allowed the man to get so close to the Prime Minister.

Security wrestled the man to the ground before hauling him off into a police van

Mr Pritchard said: 'The Met Police have some of the best close protection officers in the world. However, this was a clear breach of security and could have been far more sinister in outcome.

'With the terror threat level increased, this cannot be allowed to happen again. The Met Commissioner should call an immediate and swift internal inquiry to discover why this happened and implement the necessary lessons learned as quickly as possible.'

Former Royal protection officer Steve Park said Mr Cameron's security had taken their 'eye off the ball'.

He said: 'They were concentrating on the Prime Minister rather than looking outwardly at the attackers.

'It's a serious security breach. The Prime Minister has then been allowed to stand alone and look at it for a momentary time.

'What should have happened is something called cover and protect. A protection officer puts his hand on the head of the Prime Minister and straight into the waiting car.

'It's a very significant security breach. For an attacker to be able to get to a Prime Minister. I don't remember that happening before.' 

But Mr Cameron later played down the incident, telling MPs: 'Could I put on the record for once the debt I owe to the close protection teams that look after me and the very good job that they do.'

Making light of the incident, he added: 'John Prescott was in the room as I gave the speech so as I left the room, I thought the moment of maximum danger had probably passed. But clearly that wasn't the case.'

In 2001 Labour former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott punched a protester who egged him.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said Mr Cameron expressed his 'gratitude and confidence' in the protection team.

Downing Street will co-operate with the Met's review of the incident, the spokesman added.

Witness Chris Wilson described the man as 'just a typical hippy type', adding: 'It looked like Cameron sidestepped him. It was a lovely little move'

Mr Cameron was escorted into a waiting car after the incident in Leeds

Following the incident today, Chief Inspector Derek Hughes said: 'Around midday, a 28-year-old local man was briefly arrested after he came close to the prime minister's group who had just left the civic hall in Leeds.

'No threats were made, and after the man's details were checked, he was de-arrested and allowed on his way.'

Witness Chris Wilson described the man as 'just a typical hippy type'.

He said: 'It looked like Cameron sidestepped him. It was a lovely little move. He should be on the stage, really.

'And then he was tackled by the person behind. And then he (Cameron) was in the car and the car was gone.

'They were on him. They were like flies round poo. One minute he was down, then he was up again and moving. It was fast.'

Mr Wilson said the man ran about 10 yards across the road towards the Prime Minister. He said he was white, with a beard and dreadlocks.

Downing Street this afternoon refused to comment on the incident.
