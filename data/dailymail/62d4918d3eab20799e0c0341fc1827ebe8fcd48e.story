CBS boss Len Moonves has spoken out about the extraordinary rant unleashed by by Angus T Jones on the set of Two and a Half Men and admitted that they now have 'other plans' for the show.

Jones, who branded the show 'filth' in a now viral religious video, is thought to want to show up for the rest of his schedule after January there have been murmurs show bosses are not keen to have him back for a new season as a main character.

And now Moonves has confirmed that they're resolving the issue of the 19-year-old's status.

In the video the young star laughs as he admits his worried family have described his recent 'awakening' to the Seventh-day Adventist movement as a 'cult'... but whatever it is, it appears to have lost him his job

'I don't know what our status is with him,' Moonves told the Wall Street Journal.

'We took this boy who started with us
 when he was eight years old, and it seemed to be what happens with 
child stars over the course of time.

'He's now making $300,000 per week, 
which is not a bad salary for a 19-year-old kid, and he went on a 
religious channel and urged people not to watch the show because it was 
filth. By the way, he's still collecting his $300,000 a week,' Moonves 
laughed.

And when asked if they were looking 
for another 'half man,' Moonves replied, 'We have other plans. I don't 
think it's quite been resolved, but after going through what we went 
through with Charlie Sheen, this is a piece of cake.'

And it might not be too hard for the show to 'resolve' Jones the way of Sheen as EW are reporting that if he had the typical non-disparagement clause in his contract, he's obviously in violation.

A source close to the star told People: 'Angus expects to report to work after the holiday break in January.

'He intends to honor his contract through the end of the season.'

Jones' character Jake joined the army at the end of season 9 and has only appeared in a few episodes of the current season.

'He won't be in every episode,' the source added says of the remaining season 10 episodes.

How he was: Angus, seen here with ex-show star Charlie Sheen, has been on Two and a Half Men since he was a child

'How much they use him will be up to [creator] Chuck Lorre. The intention wasn't ever for him to be in every ep this year anyway. Now it might be less.'

Network CBS has yet to pick up the show for season 11.

But sources told E!: 'Should Two and a Half Men be renewed, it's 'unlikely" that Jones will return as a series regular. You might see him for a few guest spots.'

Those closest to Angus, who is a Seventh Day Adventist, say the teenager doesn't want to risk turning into troubled Charlie Sheen so became involved in the church.

Friends: Angus T Jones and his spiritual advisor Christopher Hudson share a joke

'Part of the reason Angus is so wary of the [TV] industry and so involved with the church is that he's seen what's happened to Charlie [Sheen] front and center.

'He doesn't want to end up like that. Who would?', the family friend told E!

Angus issued a statement apologising, in the most tenuous sense, for making a video branding Two and a Half Men 'filth' then entreating viewers to switch off from the show that made him both rich and famous.

In his statement, Jones, 19, speaks up for his bosses on the CBS show, by saying: 'Chuck Lorre, Peter Roth and many others at Warner Bros. and CBS are responsible for what has been one of the most significant experiences in my life to date.

The document obtained by TMZ continues: 'I thank them for the opportunity they have given and continue to give me and the help and guidance I have and expect to continue to receive from them.'

Without actually taking back anything
 he said, the teenager attempted to appease his cast: 'I apologise if my
 remarks reflect me showing indifference to and disrespect of my 
colleagues and a lack of appreciation of the extraordinary opportunity 
of which I have been blessed. I never intended that.'

Meanwhile, Christopher Hudson - the Seventh Day Adventist guiding Jones - denied that he was exploiting the actor, as the young star's mother Carey fears.

Hudson, who is believed to be in his 40s, confirmed that he recorded the video in the actor's trailer on the set of Two and A Half Men last week.

Jones - who makes $350,000 per episode playing Jake Harper - was seen
 urging fans to 'turn off' the show, saying it would damage their brains.

And speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Hudson - who runs what he describes as a
 christian-based ministry called the Forerunner Chronicles -  said Jones believes that Jesus Christ is returning to earth soon - and that he feels a strong urge to prepare others for the Second Coming.

He said he had spoken to Jones since the video was made public, adding: 'I respect his
 mother and the love she has for her child and her need to protect him. 
She is concerned about his well being as are many other people.

'But Angus has not had a breakdown and I am not manipulating him. He said let's do an interview - and I turned on the camera.

'Angus is a very educated, thoughtful young man. What was expressed in the video was from the sincere heart of a young man.

'I didn't encourage him to do anything. I turned the cameras on with a young man who had a story to tell.
