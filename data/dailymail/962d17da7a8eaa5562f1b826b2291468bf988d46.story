Ahead of Tottenham's Europa League first leg qualifier in Cyprus, Roberto Soldado has taken to social media to again highlight the sleeping antics of team-mate Erik Lamela.

The banter has been flowing between the pair all through pre-season and beyond after Lamela started it all off by posting a video on Instagram of the Spaniard asleep on a flight.

Soldado was quick to react giving the the young Argentine a taste of his own medicine as the latter fell asleep on a different pre-season flight.

And the 29-year-old caught the former Roma winger on camera asleep again in the back of his car on the way to Stansted airport as Sandro and himself were all smiles in the front of his car.

The north London side will be looking to build on an encouraging opening day win at Upton Park when they face EL Limassol in the first leg of their Europa League qualifier on Thursday night.

Lamela will be hoping to keep his place in Mauricio Pochettino's side for the game, with Soldado on the other hand looking for his first taste of competitive action of the season.
