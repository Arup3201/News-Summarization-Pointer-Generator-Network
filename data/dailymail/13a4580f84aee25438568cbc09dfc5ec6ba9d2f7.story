 

The Florida mother who has complained about Toys 'R Us selling Breaking Bad action figures has learned that it's best to tread lightly so as not to get Bryan Cranston mad. 

Cranston, the star of the critically acclaimed AMC drama about a cancer-stricken chemistry teacher-turned-genius meth cook, responded Monday to Susan Schrivjer on Twitter, proving that not only is he the one who knocks, but he is also the one who has the last word

'"Florida mom petitions against Toys 'R Us over Breaking Bad action figures." I'm so mad, I'm burning my Florida Mom action figure in protest,' Cranston, 58, fired off to his followers, sending ripples of glee through the Twitter-sphere.

He's the one who tweets: Bryan Cranston took a funny swipe at a Florida mother who has complained about the presence of Breaking Bad action figures in toy stores  

Apples of discord: Susan Schrivjer has called on Toys 'R Us to pull these action figures of Cranston as Walter White and Aaron Paul and Jesse Pinkman pulled from the racks 

Susan Schrivjer, from Fort Myers, Florida, made national headlines this week when she launched an online campaign to have action figures of Cranston's Walter White and Aaron Paul's Jesse Pinkman pulled from Toys 'R Us' racks.

'I was very shocked and appalled,' Schrivjer told the Today show about stumbling across the figures.

For the shockingly uninformed: the popular show followed the transformation of mild-mannered high school  teacher Walter White into ruthless drug kingpin Heisenberg when a diagnosis of terminal cancer forces him to cook meth as a means to secure his family's future.

Both White and his business partner, Jesse Pinkman, have action figure versions completed with gas masks, a duffel bag of cash, and a toy bag of Heisenberg's trademark blue crystal meth.

'Anything to do with drugs is not doing the right thing,' Schrivjer told Today. 'I just think that they need to look at their visions and values, as they call them.'

She has since put a petition up to remove the figures at Change.org, garnering 8,000 signatures as of Tuesday afternoon. 

'I was very shocked and appalled,' Susan Schrivjer told reporters about stumbling across the figures

'Toys R Us is well known around the world for their vast selection of toys for children of all ages. However their decision to sell a Breaking Bad doll, complete with a detachable sack of cash and a bag of meth, alongside children’s toys is a dangerous deviation from their family friendly values,' the petition states.

'While the show may be compelling viewing for adults, its violent content and celebration of the drug trade make this collection unsuitable to be sold alongside Barbie dolls and Disney characters.'

In response, Toys 'R Us told NBC News that 'the product packaging clearly notes that the items are intended for ages 15 and up.'

Also, the toys, which are carried in limited quantities, 'are located in the adult action figure area of our stores.' 

In an interview with the station WFTX, Schrivjer admitted that she was a fan of Breaking Bad and found the show 'riveting.'

But she expressed concerns that children playing with figurines of Heisenberg and Jesse Pinkman would come to mimic their criminal behavior.

'Do you want your child in an orange jumpsuit?' she wondered aloud, referring to the meth cooks' work attire on the show.
