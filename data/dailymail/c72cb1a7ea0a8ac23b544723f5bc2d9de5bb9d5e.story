One of Australia's highest profile bikie gang members has been confirmed dead by police, prompting an outpouring of grief from the Bandidos community.

Arthur Loveday's body was found in a motel room in Kew, near Port Macquarie, on Saturday, from an apparent suicide.

Mr Loveday, 61, had been staying at the motel for several days, and police have indicated that the circumstances surrounding his death are not suspicious, reported The Daily Telegraph.

The Bandidos member shot to notoriety when he was convicted for murdering Stephen Leslie Shipley in Parramatta Jail in 1992 and was sentenced to life in jail.

He launched an appeal, represented by a former nun as legal council, the late Mother Yvonne Swift, and was granted a pardon.

The bikie had been recruited by the Bandidos after a stint in Berrima Jail, and was often compared to 'Mr T' by the media for his tendency to wear an excess of gold jewellery. 

He had previously served time in jail for a litany of charges including rape, armed robbery, and kidnapping and had escaped from jail twice while serving sentences.

In his last conviction before he died, Mr Loveday was sentenced to nine months jail three years ago for flushing steroids down a toilet following a police raid on his home.

He moved to Port Macquarie in the late 1990's and began investing in the community, becoming involved with junior rugby league coaching and the surf life saving club, reported Port News. 

After the death of murdered Bandidos chapter president Rodney “Hooks” Monk, Mr Loveday said that he had put violence behind him.

'We’ve got enough worry about fighting terrorists let alone fighting one another,' he said.
