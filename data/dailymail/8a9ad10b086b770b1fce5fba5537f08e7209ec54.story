Customers at a Little Chef were stunned after the Duke of Edinburgh dropped in as they were enjoying breakfast.

Prince Philip is said to have spent 15 minutes at the diner near Doncaster, South Yorkshire, while he was on his way to a private engagement.

It is not yet clear whether he was tempted by one particular item on the menu - the chain's £10.99 'Royal Breakfast' fry-up.

One witness told The Sun that an 'extraordinary' convoy of upmarket vehicles descended on the car park.

'There was massive security and everyone was wondering who on earth had turned up. Then we realised it was the duke.'

It is thought that some off his staff purchased coffee but that Prince Philip himself did not have anything to eat.

The 93-year-old was on his way to a private engagement in Cumbria when he stopped off at the Little Chef on Thursday.

The Royal Breakfast fry-up consists of bacon, sausage, steak, two eggs, potatoes, beans, mushrooms, tomatoes and toast.

A Little Chef spokesman said: 'Next time he might go for that.'
