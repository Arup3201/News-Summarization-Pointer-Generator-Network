Washington DC, Milan and Vienna have been named in a top ten list of the world's best tourist destinations - along with Salisbury in Wiltshire.

The likes of Toronto in Canada and the mountainous resort of Zermatt in Switzerland are also included in the list.

But while world famous destinations across the globe stand out in the top ten table, the cathedral city of Salisbury has been named as the seventh best place to visit next year.

Milan in Italy has been named third in top ten list of best tourist destinations on the planet. The city's Belle Epoch Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II is pictured above

Washington D.C. (pictured) in the U.S. tops the list of tourist destinations thanks to its offering of museums and restaurants

Picturesque: Zermatt in Switzerland has been named fourth in the top ten list. Judges say it is popular with intrepid hikers, mountaineers and winter sports fanatics 

Washington DC tops the list, chosen by travel guide Lonely Planet.

Its 'Best Travel in 2015' feature describes it as 'one of the world’s best museum and monument cities, with the Smithsonian as a top draw.'

It adds: 'Since 2015 marks the 150th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln’s assassination, many artifacts including the famous top hat of America's 16th president and the pistol that fired the deadly shot will be on display. 

'That’s not all: mixed-use development projects are in the works, the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial has opened, there’s a vibrant gay scene and incredible ethnic eats.'

Milan, named third on the list, was described as 'a city of lavish wealth and almost frightening elegance.'

Described as a 'quintessentially English' city, Salisbury was seventh in the list of top 10 cities for 2015

Toronto in Canada was described as a 'multicultural megalopolis' which promises to be 'extra vibrant' in 2015. 

But eyebrows will have been raised by the inclusion of Salisbury at seventh on the list.

Organisers of Best in Travel 2015 say it will no longer simply be ‘a short stop on the way to Stonehenge’.

‘2015 is set to be the year visitors linger in this quintessentially English city as Salisbury uncorks the champagne for the 800th anniversary of its greatest treasure, Magna Carta.

'The lightning rod for the celebrations will be Salisbury Cathedral, the medieval masterpiece whose Chapter House holds Magna Carta.

'The cathedral itself boasts a clutch of superlatives, with the tallest spire in Britain, the world's oldest working clock and Britain's largest cloister.'

The Christmas markets of Vienna in Austria have helped the city become one of the top ten tourist destinations in the world

Valletta in Malta has been named fifth in the top ten list, drawn up by Lonely Planet

Toronto in Canada, tenth on the list, was described as a 'multicultural megalopolis' which promises to be 'extra vibrant' in 2015

Chennai in India has been named ninth on the list with judges impressed by huge strides in public transport

Best in Travel 2015 contributor Tom Hall added: 'We included Salisbury because it deserves to be recognised as one of the UK's most important destinations for travellers next year.

'Bursting with history, top class restaurants, atmospheric nightlife and a host of festivals planned for 2015, we believe Salisbury is a must-see for domestic and international travellers alike.'

Salisbury featured seventh on the list of top cities beating Vienna and Toronto.

Also in Best in Travel 2015, the Republic of Ireland has been named one of the top countries in the world for travellers in 2015.

Ireland features fifth on the list of top countries ahead of the Philippines, St Lucia and Morocco. 

According to the guide: 'Ireland is stunningly scenic, its traditions - music, dance, whiskey and beer - firmly intact and the cosmopolitan, contemporary Irish are just as friendly and welcoming as their forebears were known to be.'
