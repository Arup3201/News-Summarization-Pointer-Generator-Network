A baby gorilla was killed at the San Francisco Zoo on Friday when she ran beneath a closing door.

Kabibe, a 15-month-old western lowland gorilla born, was being moved into her night quarters at the facility when she got stick beneath the hydraulic door that separated the outside pen from the sleeping area.

She was killed instantly.

So sad: The 15-month-old gorilla was crushed by a hydraulic door while running to her night quarters

'Some animal deaths are more difficult to process than others, and this tragedy has struck us all in the deepest way imaginable,' San Francisco Zoo Executive Director and President Tanya Peterson said in a statement to NBC on Saturday.

The incident, which is being called a freak accident,m is under investigation. 

Workers at the zoo were particularly close with Kabibe as she required around the clock care for the first six months of her life.

And while many mourned the loss of Kabibe on social media Saturday, others will no doubt use this opportunity to protest the captivity of animals in zoos.
