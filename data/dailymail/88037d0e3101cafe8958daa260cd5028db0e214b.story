Tragic: 13-year-old schoolgirl Billie -Jo Jenkins was murdered at the home she shared with he foster father Sion Jenkins in 1997

Billie-Jo Jenkins' foster father has joined calls for police to investigate the 
possibility she was killed by M25 rapist Antoni Imiela.

Sion Jenkins, 54, served six years in jail for the 1997 murder of the 13-year-old schoolgirl but was acquitted.

Billie-Jo was found in a pool of blood after being bludgeoned over the head with a metal tent peg on the porch of the family home in Hastings in February 1997.

Former headteacher Sion Jenkins was found guilty of her murder but two retrials both resulted in a hung jury and after the second, in February 2006, the trial judge told Jenkins that, finally, he was a free man.

However it recently emerged that M25 rapist Imiela was living near the home which 13-year-old Billy-Jo
shared with her foster father at the time of her murder.

Sion Jenkins told the Daily Mirror: 'Obviously I want to see the case opened again.

'One of the most distressing things for me and for others who loved Billie is the fear the case will be forgotten.

'It is the first time I have been made aware that this man's girlfriend and friends lived near to our home.'

Last week Billie-Jo's aunt Margaret Costner highlighted a series of facts that link Imiela to Billie-Jo's murder.

Imiela fits the description of a man who reportedly stalked Billie-Jo in the months before her murder.

Billi-Jo had revealed to friends she was being stalked by a man wearing a leather jacket from December 1996.

According to Imiela's neigbours, the rapist wore a black leather jacket at the same time.

Imiela had friends living in Hastings at the time and was 
reportedly obsessed with girls around Billie-Jo's age.

Murder weapon: 13-year-old Billie-Jo was bludgeoned to death with an 18in tent spike

He often used 
improvised weapons in his violent attacks and once placed a bin liner over the head of one of his 
victims. A small piece of bun liner was discovered in Billi-Jo's 
nostrils.

Ms Coster, who is 
the sister of her natural father Bill, told the Daily Mirror: 'The 
investigation needs to be re-opened for Billie-Jo's sake.

'The
police must find out what Imiela was doing on the day she was murdered.
Somebody murdered Billy-Jo and we've got to find out who it was.

'We
need police to investigate all avenues. Imiela could have done it and 
the fact is we don't know and need to know. Was he in Hastings that 
day?'

last month Imiela was found guilty of brutally raping a 29-year-old woman on Christmas Day in 1987 thanks to DNA evidence.

Imiela, of
Ashford, Kent, was convicted of raping mother-of-two Sheila
Jankowitz as she left her flat in Sydenham, South East London, in the 
early hours.

The
case was unusual because Mrs Jankowitz was murdered in South Africa in 
2006 and her only evidence came from a written statement.

Instead
her husband and daughter, who remain deeply traumatised by the attack, 
were forced to relive the ordeal in the witness box.

Mrs
Jankowitz was dragged on to waste ground behind the block of flats 
where she lived with her family, punched, threatened with a brick and 
subjected to an appalling attack.

Forensic
tests revealed the likelihood of a sample of bodily fluids found on the
victim coming from someone other than Imiela was ‘one in a billion’.

Imiela
was labelled the M25 rapist after snatching women and girls off the 
street in several Home Counties before using the motorway as a  getaway 
route.
