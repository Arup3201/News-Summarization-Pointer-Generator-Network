Homes are now taking so long to sell in the sluggish housing market that sellers are trying all sorts of ways to move things along.

Some entice buyers by including sit-on mowers in the fixtures and fittings. In Sandbanks, Bournemouth’s millionaires’ row, an ocean-going boat was recently thrown into the sale.

In Kennington, outside Ashford in Kent, one couple – Ian and Anna Grant – have gone one stage further. The Grants have dreamed up a scheme where, if they find buyers for their own Grade II listed mill house, and those buyers are having trouble selling, they will buy their purchaser’s home themselves.

Ambitious offer: Anna and Ian Grant, pictured outside their current home, are offering to 'swap' their home for a prospective buyer's

It sounds too good to be true but Ian, 82, who spent his working life in the motor trade, has clearly thought through every detail. ‘We’ll give slightly below market value for our buyer’s house to pay for estate agents’ fees and to cover the hassle of having to sell the house for them,’ he explains.

‘But what’s the matter with that? You wouldn’t expect to be given the full sale price of a car if you sold it to a garage in a part-exchange deal, so the same should apply to a house.’

Not surprisingly, there are some limits on the offer: the couple insist that any purchasers’ home they buy must be in saleable condition – and that it costs less than the mill house.

Priced at £910,000 – and divided into two parts – the couple’s property is no ‘run-of-the-mill’ mill house.

The main section, including six bedrooms, a sitting room, drawing room, dining room and kitchen, is an impressive Georgian home, with low ceilings, original open fireplaces, cornicing and superb views over the mill stream to the wooded gardens and grounds.

Adjoining this part of the house is the second part of the property – what used to be the old mill building. This amounts to three rooms of bare space, each 30ft x 17ft, arranged above one another on separate floors.

Ian used the ground floor room as a snooker room and the two others were Anna’s offices and studios. Although these rooms could be used by a future owner as, say, a gallery space, they are, to be blunt, scruffy.

Anna says: ‘I can see people’s faces when I show them around. They stand there thinking, “What on earth can we do with this?” ’ The answer, the couple suggest, is to renovate this part of the house into a self-contained home. Alex Davies, a director at estate agents Hobbs Parker, believes this could be achieved for £50,000.

Aren’t the Grants taking a bit of a gamble, volunteering to buy a house that is likely to be another ‘sticker’ on the market?

‘We don’t think so,’ says Anna, 76, who was a professional ballet dancer in the late Fifties before becoming an actress in the Sixties, once playing opposite Sean Connery in a television drama. ‘We have money to invest, and interest rates from the banks are so low that in the long term we are better off putting our money into property, thereby killing two birds with one stone.’

Anyone who suspects that this scheme has come about because the Grants are less than financially secure should think again.

Anna recently sold her own business – dealing in the ingredients that make cosmetics – and she did well enough out of it to move into the couple’s new main home, which is a 15-acre estate outside Sittingbourne, complete with pet donkeys, dogs and pigs.

Ian, a successful rally driver in his time, is also comfortably off. The couple also have a house in London and they have no pressing financial need to sell the mill house.

Yet tough business people though they are, it is obvious that the mill house, which they bought 12 years ago, is very special to them.

‘We have had some marvellous garden parties here,’ says Ian. ‘Once we had a marquee and it was simply too hot for anyone to stay inside it, so the guests moved under the ancient chestnut tree and dipped their feet in the stream. We’d like others to get similar pleasure out of the old place.’
