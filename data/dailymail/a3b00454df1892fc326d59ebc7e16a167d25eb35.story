The ex-wife of an Englishman who killed his two children had ‘regularly fought’ him having custody, it emerged today.

Julian Stevenson, 47, was arrested on Saturday after the bodies of Mathew, 10, and Carla, five, were found in his apartment in a suburb of Lyon, eastern France.  

He is said to have slit their throats in a fit of rage before fleeing on a pair of roller-skates.

France’s judicial authorities are now trying to establish why Stevenson, who had a history of violence and alcoholism, had been left in charge of the children over the weekend.

They had been dropped off with Stevenson at the former family home on Friday evening - the first time he had been allowed unsupervised access in two years because of a bitter custody battle

His wife Stephanie was badly beaten up by him in 2005 and 2010, when an order was made preventing Stevenson seeing the children without a third party adult being present.

Yet CCTV footage shot at a bakery on Saturday shows Stevenson in sole custody of his son Mathew, 10, and five-year-old daughter Carla, five, as he buys them sweets.

The 2010 order was said to have been reversed over the past few weeks, meaning Stevenson was allowed to have the children to stay on Friday night for the first time in three years.

‘We need to know why this happened,’ said a judicial source. ‘Interviews with the mother make it clear that she had regularly fought him having care of the children.

‘She is still in a state of extreme shock, and is being cared for by clinical psychologists, and as well as family and friends.’

Yesterday Stevenson was formally placed under criminal investigation and is likely to be remanded  in custody until his trial.

Another judicial source said: ‘We are presently holding back from the charge of premeditated murder but this could always change.’

The source said all the circumstances surrounding the horrific crime would be investigated over many months.

The 47-year-old, originally from Cheltenham, even waved goodbye to staff as his children followed him out of the store in a suburb of Lyon

Neighbours of Stevenson said he had appeared ‘calm and relaxed’ as he wandered around the St Priest suburb of Lyon, where he lives, with the two children on Saturday morning.

‘It was a warm day and he was in T-shirt and long shorts,’ said one. ‘The children were smiling happily, and appeared to be enjoying a day out with their dad.

‘He was buying them little presents, including sweets, and did not appear in the least bit flustered.’

When Mrs Stevenson, an accountant’s assistant also in her 40s, returned to pick up the children from the second floor apartment at around 5pm on Saturday she saw Stevenson looking ‘panicked and angry’, according to a neighbour.

‘He was in the stairwell of the block, and his clothes were covered in blood,’ said the neighbour. ‘He made off on a pair of roller-skates, leaving his car in the apartment block’s garage.’

Following a short manhunt, Stevenson was found in Lyon’s 8th arrondissement at around 8pm on the same evening.

A judicial source said that a knife which was thought to be the murder weapon had been found in the flat.

The source said the double murder was ‘clearly linked to a painful separation’ and ‘legal procedures concerning the right to access to the children which the father deemed insufficient.’

Stevenson has been living in France for 10 years and married in 2005. His wife was finally heard by prosecutors on Sunday, providing them with details of her troubled relationship with her ex-husband.

Investigators were particularly keen to know who gave the father legal authority to look after the children.
