Cruise lines can get a bad reputation for claustrophobic cabins and annoying entertainment - not to mention norovirus outbreaks - but there are some that go above and beyond to break the mould and guarantee their guests the trip of a lifetime.

Spending weeks (or even months) on a cruise ship, you want to make sure your hard-earned money and holiday time is well spent.  

Whether you look for the best on-board dining, family-friendly lines, or the ultimate in luxury, this list can steer you in the right direction. Cruise reviews website Cruise Critic has announced its UK Editors' Picks Awards for 2014, rounding up the best cruise liners on the seas.

New ship on the block: Royal Caribbean's Quantum of the Seas is among the winners of Cruise Critic's UK Editors' Picks Awards for 2014

Cruising: The awards round up the best cruise liners of the year, selected in 18 categories including best for luxury, itineraries and romance

Adventure: Hurtigruten line takes guests to see the Northern Lights in Norway and the Arctic Circle

Royal Caribbean's newest ship, Quantum of the Seas is the big news in cruising at the moment. The jaw-dropping vessel, which made its debut last month, was awarded Best New Ship for being both 'innovative' and 'revolutionary' with its glass viewing pod, skydiving simulator, and robotic bartenders. 

Royal Caribbean line was also commended for Best Entertainment, while P&O Cruises was awarded Best for Families and Best Dining with their roster of celebrity chefs including Marco Pierre White, Atul Kochhar, James Martin, and Eric Lanlard.

Marco Pierre White has overseen the Ocean Grill restaurants across P&O's fleet, however Cruise Critic nominated the chef's The White Room on the ship Ventura as head and shoulders above the rest.

For luxury, Regent Seven Seas Cruises was deemed the finest on the seas for truly treating guests like royalty. Cruise Critic chose the line as it 'is the only line at this end of the ultra-luxury scale that truly delivers all-inclusive luxury.'

When they promise all-inclusive, they really do deliver. Flights and pre or post-cruise tours are included, as are onshore excursions as well as high-quality liquor. Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines won the Best Value for Money award for the third year running.

Celebrity Cruise Line's Solstice Class ships won the Best Suites category for the second consecutive year, as well as the award for Best Cabins.

Celebrity's ship Reflection has increased the number of its AquaClass staterooms due to high demand. The luxury suites come with a spa concierge to arrange spa appointments, exclusive access to a 'clean-eating' restaurant on board and the relaxation room, and a wellness programme that includes meditation and yoga.

Other winners include Voyages of Discovery (Best Itineraries), Azamara Club Cruises (Best Shore Excursions), and Cunard's Commodore Club on Queen Mary 2, which was awarded Best Cruise Ship Bar.

Emerald Waterways won Best New River Ship for their Emerald Star and Emerald Sky, while CroisiEurope was awarded Best River Cruise Line. 

'The cruise industry offers a wealth of choice, and the Editors' Picks Awards share our expert insight and provide guidance to British holidaymakers who are interested in a cruise,' commented Adam Coulter, UK editor Cruise Critic. 

'With cruise lines constantly improving their products this isn't an easy task, but we have identified the lines which have excelled in order to help cruisers plan their perfect cruise, and ensure the time and money they invest is well spent.' 

Carolyn Spencer Brown, editor-in-chief of Cruise Critic, added: 'We originally launched our Editors' Picks Awards in 2008, to highlight lines that we felt were doing a great job. 

'Just six years later, the industry has grown tremendously; cruise lines continue to up the ante, and there are more options than ever before for travelers looking to hit the seas.'
