King’s Road, Chelsea, is the home of swagger. So it is fitting that two men with perhaps the most impressive struts in European football will go head-to-head just a stone’s throw away at Stamford Bridge next month.

Chelsea against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League quarter-finals means only one thing: Jose Mourinho versus Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

Mourinho, the self-styled Special One, and Ibrahimovic, the man who said: ‘I don’t need the Ballon d’Or to know I’m the best.’

Time to deliver: Jose Mourinho's Chelsea side have been drawn against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League, which means he will be up against one of his former players, Zlatan Ibrahimovic

Here I come: Ibrahimovic will be aiming to knock Chelsea out of the Champions League with PSG

Will London and Paris be big enough for the both of them? We are about to find out thanks to Friday’s draw.

We
 know they can work together, having seen them forge a strong bond 
during their time in tandem at Inter Milan — so much so that the Swede 
wrote in his autobiography: ‘Mourinho would become a guy I was basically
 willing to die for.’

But what happens when these two heavyweight egos exchange blows?

Mourinho will certainly fancy his chances of seeing Chelsea qualify for a third consecutive European semi-final.

Speaking
 before yesterday’s draw, he said: ‘The most difficult opponents you can
 get in European football are all in the draw. Maybe all the teams want 
to face us. I believe so.

‘Chelsea are maybe the biggest outsiders… maybe us and Manchester United.

‘You
 have the two finalists from last season (Bayern Munich and Borussia 
Dortmund); you have the two Spanish giants (Barcelona and Real Madrid); 
you have Atletico Madrid, a fantastic team over the last couple of years
 and you have Paris Saint-Germain.

‘Maybe they look at us and United, because they are not having a great season, and consider us the two clubs they all want.’

Chelsea faced PSG in the group stages in 2004-05, drawing 0-0 at home and winning 3-0 away.

The
 Portuguese’s mind games have become a feature of his second stint at 
Stamford Bridge — with his assertion that Chelsea are not serious title 
contenders, despite being top of the Premier League, the most baffling 
of all.

Mourinho seems 
intent on doing everything to relieve pressure on his players. He will 
no doubt insist PSG are favourites to win the tie — and there is a 
strong argument to back that claim — but he will still fancy his 
chances.

Thanks to their 
Qatari  owners, PSG’s squad is one of the most expensively assembled on 
the continent. However, as Chelsea’s Roman Abramovich can testify, money
 cannot buy everything.

Having
 spent a fortune, the Russian still had to wait nine years and endure 
numerous nights of heartbreak before Champions League success in Munich 
in 2012.

PSG have not gone 
past the quarter-final stage since 1995, when they lost in the 
semi-finals. Mourinho, on the other hand, knows exactly what it takes to
 go all the way — as do his players. Two consecutive UEFA trophies prove
 that.

So, in the end, this tie could be decided by two larger-than- life characters.

Can
 Mourinho’s tactical  acumen nullify Ibrahimovic’s threat? Or will the 
Swede’s sheer talent be too much for Chelsea? We are about to find out. 
Meanwhile, get ready for those egos to be inflated just a little bit 
more

Jose Mourinho and Zlatan Ibrahimovic are no shrinking violets, so there is every expectation of fireworks now that these two are drawn on a collision course, writes Andrew Magee.

On the Chelsea job: 'If I wanted to have an easy job I would have stayed at Porto. Beautiful blue chair, the UEFA Champions League trophy, God, and after God, me.'

On God: 'He must really think I’m a great guy, otherwise He would not have given me so much. He must have a very high opinion of me.'

On his ability: 'Please don’t call me arrogant, but I’m European champion and I think I’m a special one.'

On nicknames: 'I am the only one who has won the three most important leagues. Maybe instead of the ‘Special One’, people should call me the "Only One".'

On his looks: ‘If they made a film of my life, I think they should get George Clooney to play me. He’s a fantastic actor and my wife thinks he would be ideal.’

On trials: 'Arsene Wenger asked me to have a trial with Arsenal when I was 17. I turned it down. Zlatan doesn’t do auditions.'

On versatility: 'I can play in the 11 positions because a good player can play anywhere on the pitch.'

On injury: 'An injured Zlatan is a pretty serious thing for any team.'

On what to get his wife for her birthday: 'Nothing, she has Zlatan.'

On being marked by Stephane Henchoz: 'First I went left, he did too. Then I went right, and he did too. Then I went left again, and he went to buy a hot dog.'

On Jose: 'Jose Mourinho is a big star. The first time he met my wife he said: "Helena, you have one mission. Feed Zlatan, let him sleep, keep him happy." He says what he wants. I like him.'
