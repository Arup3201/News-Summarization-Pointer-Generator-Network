George Osborne was accused of 'insulting' middle-class voters last night after claiming that making them pay higher tax rates is 'good for them' because it makes them feel successful

George Osborne was accused of ‘insulting’ middle-class voters last night after claiming that making them pay higher tax rates is ‘good for them’ because it makes them feel successful – and more likely to back the Tories.

Conservative MPs were stunned when the Chancellor made the explosive remark at a secret meeting at his Downing Street office, the contents of which have been leaked to The Mail on Sunday.

The disclosure came as Mr Osborne is poised to announce a Budget boost for the low-paid by raising the threshold for income tax to £10,500, while rejecting pleas to stop more middle earners being dragged into the 40p tax band.

MPs at the meeting reacted with horror when he told them: ‘Let’s not forget there are advantages in more people paying tax at 40p.

‘It means they feel they are a success and joining the aspirational classes.

'That means they are more likely to think like Conservatives and vote Conservative.

'If they are paying 40p tax they have a greater interest in cutting Government spending because they are paying for it. All the polling evidence suggests I am right.’

One MP who was present said: ‘There was a stunned silence. I never thought I’d hear a Tory Chancellor say paying more tax is good for the middle classes. It was a Marie Antoinette moment.’

Another added: ‘The 40p rate may not affect the millionaire son of a baronet like Mr Osborne but it is killing hard-working people who earn around £40,000. It was an insult and shows how out of touch this Government has become.’

One Tory told Mr Osborne that his argument was ‘illogical’: ‘You cannot argue that making more  people pay 40p tax is good because they are more likely to want to cut government spending, while letting more people at the bottom end pay no tax whatsoever.’

The Chancellor’s claim was made at a meeting with senior Tory MPs on the executive of the party’s 1922 Committee on February 5.

The group was led by 1922 chairman Graham Brady and included John Whittingdale, Bernard Jenkin, Simon Hart, Heather Wheeler and Nick de Bois. Mr Whittingdale was among those who challenged Mr Osborne.

He said: ‘I simply don’t follow your 
logic. What Conservative voters really want is the same as all voters – 
that is to pay less tax, not more.

'Those on a higher rate want to pay a 
lower one and those on a lower one do not want to be dragged into higher
 one. That is one of the fundamental differences between us and our 
opponents and it has stood us  in good stead for many years.’

The Chancellor’s team later contacted Tory tax rebels ordering them to stay quiet. ‘I was told that  if I carried on speaking out, I was betraying the party,’ said one.

‘The people who are betraying the party are not me but those who have abandoned our roots.’

Ministers say Mr Osborne is determined to steal the credit from Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg for lifting the starting rate for tax, due to go up to £10,000 in April, by at least another £500 next year.

The policy was devised by Mr Clegg, but it is believed Mr Osborne is toying with increasing it by between £750 and £1,000 next year.

Increasing the personal allowance to £10,500 is worth an extra £100 a year – or £2 a week – to everyone earning up to £100,000 a year, at an annual cost of £1.5 billion. Supporters of a rise in the 40p rate threshold say it would give higher earners approximately an extra £200 a year. But Mr Osborne’s aides believe it would be seen as unfair.

The claims were made at a meeting with senior Tory MPs on the executive party of the 1922 Committee. Nick de Bois (left) and committee chairman Graham Brady (right) were present at the meeting

Also at the secret meeting at Mr Osborne's Downing Street office were Bernard Jenkin (left), John Wittingdale (right), Heather Wheeler, Robert Buckland and Simon Hart

‘We can’t give the better-off £200 more and the less-well-off £100,’ said one. ‘The punters just won’t buy it and we have to listen to them.’

A Treasury source said: ‘George was making the point that under a Tory Chancellor, people on the 40p rate are paying less tax.’

Meanwhile Mr Osborne’s Treasury deputy, Lib Dem Chief Secretary Danny Alexander, today takes a swipe at ex-Tory Chancellor Nigel Lawson over the tax row.

In his article, below, Mr Alexander attacks ‘siren voices’ like Lord Lawson who complain too many people are now paying the 40p rate.

Without referring to Lord Lawson, Mr Alexander observes pointedly that ‘one of the leading exponents of this theory is also a noted denier of climate change (so), it is no surprise they are completely missing the point.’

Sources confirmed the jibe was aimed at Lord Lawson, a noted climate-change sceptic.

The 40p tax band was introduced in 1988 by Nigel Lawson
