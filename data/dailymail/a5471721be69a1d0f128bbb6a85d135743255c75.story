A former Olympic gold medalist boxer has been awarded his latest victory but this time is comes in the form of a tense legal battle.

Pernell 'Sweet Pea' Whitaker has been fighting in court to have his mother evicted from the house that he bought her decades ago.

The 50-year-old athlete, who has accumulated significant debt and faced drug problems in the past, did not seem torn up about it and after a Virginia court ruled in his favor on Wednesday, he called it 'a beautiful moment'.

Whitaker bought a two-story brick home in Norfolk, Virginia in 1984 and he gave it to his mother Novella Whitaker when he was at the height of his career when he had earned millions.

She lived in the home with some of Pernell's six siblings while he moved into his own house in the upscale neighborhood of Church Point.

Problems ensued, as ABC News reports that he had a number of drug abuse incidents and accumulated a rap sheet.

In order to pay off debts, he asked his mother and two siblings who were living in the house to help contribute to the upkeep costs or move out so that he could get cash from the mortgages.

'It’s sad for him to have to take action against his mother, but none of the family would contribute to the real estate and he had no alternative but to use the court process,' his attorney Bruce Gould told ABC News.

'He’s not happy that it was necessary to go to court but he now has two mortgages on the house and the alternative was if he didn’t sell, it was going to go to foreclosure.'

He legally held onto the deed for the home and still owns it even though he has never lived there, and the court ruled that the verbal agreement that he made with his mother and siblings was non-binding.

Whitaker officially announced his retirement in April 2001 and he has been training other boxers in the time since but that has not brought in as much cash as hoped.

'It’s significantly diminished over the years and he’s not able to maintain this $400,000 house for his mother and siblings to live in,' Mr Gould said.

His mother maintained a relatively positive outlook on the issue when interviewed by local station WVEC following the Wednesday verdict.

'I'm going to survive. I'm a survivor. I'm going with my daughter...she is taking me in,' Novella Whitaker said.

His sister Zelda Brown was not as diplomatic.

'He’ll be a son forever until death do us part, but he is putting a rip through the family,' she said.
