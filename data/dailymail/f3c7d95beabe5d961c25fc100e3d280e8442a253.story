Arsenal need to challenge for the Premier League title within the next two seasons, according to former defender Nigel Winterburn.

Although Arsene Wenger has guided the Gunners to  Champions League qualification for an impressive 17 consecutive seasons, the 2004 champions have arguably not mounted a serious tilt at the title for five years.

It will be 11 years this summer since the so-called 'Invincibles' claimed the trophy by going an entire season unbeaten in the league - with Winterburn calling for a return of domestic glory to silence disgruntled supporters.

'This summer Arsenal have to look ahead and see where the progression is going to come from,' he told talkSPORT.

'I do feel, within the next two years, Arsenal have to challenge for the Premier League title.' 

Meanwhile, Wenger believes his side can defy the odds in Monaco as they bid to become the first team in Champions League history to overturn a deficit of two or more goals having played at home first.

Arsenal will arrive at the Stade Louis II trailing the Ligue 1 side 3-1 with their European hopes hanging by a thread after a disastrous last 16 first leg at the Emirates.

Former Arsenal defender Winterburn claims only a serious challenge will soothe disgruntled fans

'The statistics are against us, we are conscious of that,' said the Arsenal boss. 'We have to give absolutely everything to make the stats lie. That's our desire. 

'We believe we can do it and I'm confident we will. If we didn't believe we wouldn't be here. Football is not predictable.

'We totally missed the first leg, which was surprising. We did not play well. Sometimes in life if you miss a chance, you do not have a second chance, but we do, so we will play it fully.'
