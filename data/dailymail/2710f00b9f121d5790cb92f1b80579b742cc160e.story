Prime Minister Tony Abbott has pledged $5 million in aid to Iraq as he reaffirmed his commitment to tackling Islamic State militants in the country.

During an unannounced secret visit to Baghdad, Mr Abbott vowed Australia will stand with Iraq in their fight against the terrorists as he held talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.

‘This is an important struggle. It's a struggle not just for the people of Iraq, and not just for the people of this region, but for the whole world - because the Daesh death cult, the ISIL death cult, has declared war against the world,’ Mr Abbot said.

His surprise visit to the country came after his planned trip at Christmas - to meet Australian troops serving with the US-led coalition - was cancelled because of the Sydney siege on December 15.

Mr Abbott and Mr al-Abadi discussed military cooperation between the two countries, including the training and equipping of Iraqi soldiers.

Australia currently has 200 special force soldiers on standby to enter the country and Australian fighter jets are continuing to bomb Islamic State targets in northern Iraq.

Referring to the Sydney siege, Mr Abbott said: ‘We have also seen exhortations from the death cult to people right around the world to engage in acts of terrorism, and even Australia has had its brush with terrorism in recent weeks.’

‘We are determined to deepen our co-operation with the government and the people of Iraq in the weeks and months to come,’ he added.

‘Not because we are a country which goes forward seeking foreign fights, but because where our vital national interests are threatened, where universal values are at stake, Australia should be a strong partner.’

Australia has so far spent $22 million on humanitarian assistance in Iraq since June 2014, Nine News reports.

The latest $5 million pledged will help the World Food Program provide food for around 350,000 people for a month.

The Islamic State group now holds about a third of Iraq and Syria under its self-declared caliphate. The Iraqi army collapsed last summer as it struggled to fight back against the extremists.
