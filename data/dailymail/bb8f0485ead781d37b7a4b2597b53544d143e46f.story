Yeovil scored two late goals to finally finish off Accrington Stanley and set up a dream FA Cup third round tie against Manchester United.

The League One side made hard work of their League Two opponents, but two strikes in the final five minutes won the game and earned them at least an extra £250,000 in prize and TV money.

Simon Gillett volleyed in from 20-yards after a weak punch from Accrington goalkeeper Jack rose fell to him on 85 minutes and in the last minute substitute Kieffer Moore headed in to seal the win.

Louis Van Gaal will now bring his players to Yeovil's Huish Park in the next round.

It was clear what progression meant to both sides when the closest chance for either side in the first half was gifted by their opponents.

Accrington Stanley's Tom Aldred was inches away from scoring a calamitous own goal after 12 minutes. The defender raced back towards goal to chase a long pass through and nodded the ball back to Rose, not realising his team-mate had hurtled from goal to intercept. The header wrong-footed Rose and beat the desperate Aldred to the line, only to trickle past the left post.

Then just before the half-hour mark Brendan Moloney, brought in at the last minute to Yeovil's line-up after Jordan Clarke pulled out in the warm-up, under-hit a back pass to his goalkeeper, which let Accrington Stanley striker Marcus Carver in. But Yeovil stopper Jed Steer managed to steer the player wide and tip the ball off the pitch for a corner.

The home side had more of the ball and should have taken the lead.

Midfielder Joseph Edwards ran through on goal in the 30th minute and had two team-mates waiting in the middle for a ball across and a simple finish. Edwards went for goal instead and struck a shot straight at Rose.

Yeovil continued to press and Gillett let a throw-in from the left run across his body then hit a drive towards the far right goal, only for the ball to sail narrowly past the right post with Rose beaten.

League One Yeovil stand to pocket £221,000 after setting up a glamour third round tie with Manchester United.

The FA dish out £27,000 in prize money for a second-round victory, plus the club will earn a further £144,000 from BT Sport, who will broadcast United’s third round tie live.

Yeovil are set to earn in the region of £50,000 inn gate receipts with the United tie almost certain to be sold out at Yeovil’s 9,565-seater stadium.

Yeovil would be set to earn a staggering £1.5m from the third round tie if they can force a replay at old Trafford.

The towering Tom Eaves – standing at 6ft 5ins tall – had two similar chances inside the box on the left-hand side, but he hit both hard and wide of the near post.

Heavy rain which begun falling just before kick off continued to beat down turning the second half more to chance with players slipping and sliding. Shirts and shorts turned brown with mud as the two teams battled, knowing what was at stake.

Yeovil pressed on and in the 53rd minute Gillett twisted and turned and got off a shot inside the box, as he slid, which was again close.

Bu five minutes later at the other end a ball was swung into Yeovil's box which caused chaos, allowing Andy Proctor to get a shot away from eight yards but he fired over.

The added pressure on both teams – that thought of facing Manchester United in the next round – weighed heavy and was felt in every slightly over-hit shot. Every chance on goal and defensive slip was a hero and villain waiting to happen.

Yeovil's Sam Foley had plenty of time to judge his shot as the ball dropped from a height but the ball went over. At the other end Seamus McCarten made a strong run through the middle but his shot forced a top save from Steer. 

McCarten then hit the bar with a 20-yard shot, which came back out to Matt Crooks and with goalkeeper on the floor and only two yards out he headed wide.

That was Accrington's chance – and it passed them by agonisingly. Then, with the game heading into extra time, Yeovil finished it off.
