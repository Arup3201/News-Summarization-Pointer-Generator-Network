Her dark hair piled in a stylish bun atop her head and resplendent in a black and silver salwar kameez, Shaheen Qureshi, from Bradford, looks every inch the glamorous working mother.

But while Qureshi might not look unusual, her second marriage was anything but. For, like many thousands more, the mother-of-eight was once a 'co-wife' to a polygamous husband.

Yet despite being open to the idea of a second polygamous union, Qureshi admits that her first didn't exactly go to plan.

Divorced: Shaheen Qureshi recently divorced her second husband whom she shared with a co-wife

'I met him at a car wash,' she beams, remembering the day she met the man who would become her second husband.

'I went to clean my car and came back with a husband. Everyone always jokes that I shouldn't be allowed to go to a car wash in case I end up married again!'

Then a single mother following the break-up of her first marriage to a Pakistani cousin, Qureshi says she was looking for companionship and a 'stable family life'.

What she got was something quite different, with her British Muslim husband spending a total of just six months in her company over their 10-year marriage.

'The second marriage really suited me at first,' she explains. 'I had seven children, some with special needs, and I just wanted to have a husband. 

Not much time: Shaheen says she didn't get to spend as much time with her husband as she expected to

Commonplace: An estimated 20,000 polygamous families live in the UK, even though it is illegal under UK law

'We were really similar; there were only six months between us. We had both been married before and we had the same level of thinking.

'I didn't want to be on my own, I wanted support. A part-time marriage really suited me.'

And Qureshi is certainly not the only woman to think so, with an estimated 20,000 polygamous marriages estimated to exist in the UK alone - nearly all of which are between Muslims.

Worldwide, an estimated five per cent of Muslim marriages are multiple ones, an arrangement endorsed by verse 4:3 of the Qu'ran which states: 

'Marry of the women, who seem good to you, two or three or four; and if ye fear that ye cannot do justice to so many then one only.'

Among those to follow its dictates is Dubai's Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Makoum who has two wives: his first cousin Hind bint Maktoum bin Juma Al Maktoum and Jordan's Princess Haya bint Al Hussein.

Not so glamorous: Despite trying for more than a decade, Shaheen's polygamous marriage was disappointing

Indeed, Princess Haya is herself the child of a polygamous match with her father, the late King Hussein of Jordan, taking no fewer than four wives, among them the British-born Princess Muna al-Hussein.

But glamorous though the lives of Princess Haya and the Jordanian consorts are, for Qureshi, struggling to raise a large family in Bradford, the reality was quite different.

So too was her relationship with her husband's first wife, which she had hoped would be 'like Sex and the City' but in reality, was plagued by tension and jealousy.

'Initially I didn't have any contact with his first wife,' she explains. 'I think she was fairly upset when she first found out that we had got married.'

Not that Qureshi was particularly bothered by that. 'She can't really argue about it as her mother was a second wife,' she adds. 'So if she ever says anything I just say: "Well why did your father remarry?"'

So why did he? According to Qureshi, second, third and even fourth marriages are made for one reason alone - because the man isn't happy with the wife he has.

Appearance: Like this Bradford family, Shaheen will appear on Channel 4's The Men With Many Wives tonight

Looking for love: Shaheen says she would like to find another husband - even if he already has a wife

'Men are polygamous by nature,' she insists. 'That's just life. I'm not a jealous person at all, I have a big heart and I'm willing to give.

'I think the purpose of the second wife is to meet the needs of the husband that perhaps he isn't getting from the first wife. 

'Isn't this better than him having an affair and coming back and giving you chlamydia?'

Despite Qureshi's desire to make her husband happy, things didn't work out quite as she had hoped with her husband spending at most a couple of hours a week at her home, instead of the three to four days they had originally agreed upon.

After a decade of feeling alone, she decided to end the relationship, making the move herself on the grounds that 'it was easier for me to walk away than him'.

Now single once again, Qureshi hasn't entirely given up hope of finding love again and says she would even consider another polygamous match should the right one come along.

'I think that a marriage is like a cake,' she explains. 'If you put in rubbish ingredients, it won't be any good but if you put in beautiful ingredients, you will get a beautiful cake.'

Key to making Qureshi's 'beautiful cake' is finding sympathetic co-wives who understand the situation and won't get jealous.

'I would like to find a co-wife who is similar to me,' she smiles. 'I hear these stories of these co-wives where there are three or four of them and they are best friends like the Sex and the City girls. 

'They share the responsibilities and don't chase one another down, stick in hand. This is what breaks the man down mentally. I just want to be the best wife I can.'
