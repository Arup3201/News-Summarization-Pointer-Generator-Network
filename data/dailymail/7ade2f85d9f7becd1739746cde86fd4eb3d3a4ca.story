It has been a costly mission to restore the world's most famous penguin to his ocean home.

But all the efforts - and money spent - appear to have been vain as it seems Happy Feet may have ended up as a predator's lunch.

The wandering emperor penguin had been nursed back to health after being found hundreds of miles from home on a New Zealand beach, desperately ill after eating sand he thought was snow.

A human surgeon was even brought in to remove sticks and stones from his stomach.

Happy Feet then had a GPS transmitter
attached to him so his progress back into Antarctic waters could be 
tracked when he was released back into the ocean last week.

But the device stopped working last Friday - about half way to his destination in the Southern Ocean.

Experts said that while it is possible the device fell off and is sitting at the bottom of the ocean while Happy Feet continues safely on his journey, they fear he could also have met his fate in the jaws of a larger creature.

Emperor penguins have a number of predators including sharks, seals and killer whales.

In an early statement, Sirtrack, the company that attached the transmitter, told the New Zealand Herald that the lack of signal 'leads to the conclusion that either the satellite transmitter has detached or an unknown event has prevented Happy Feet from resurfacing'.

A spokesman for the company said 
there was 'a chance' the juvenile penguin had been eaten, adding: 'That's what 
makes the world go round.'

But as animal lovers expressed their 
horror that Happy Feet had been 
attacked and eaten, Sirtrack put out a new statement.

Mr Kevin Lay, speaking for the 
company, said that the transmitter appeared to be in good working order 
up to the time it stopped sending data and the most likely explanation 
for the silence is that it had fallen off.

The transmitter, he said, had been only glued on so that it would fall off in time.

'We hoped it would stay on for five or six months, but it appears in this case it's only stayed on for two weeks.'

Mr Lay added that it was possible the penguin had been eaten, but he was doubtful.

'There are some species that will forage on emperor penguins but it's not likely that it has happened to Happy Feet because of the area he was in,' he told New Zealand's ONE 
News.

'We firmly believe that the transmitter has become detached.'

He said another possibility was that Happy Feet was underwater when the satellites that picked up the GPS signals were overhead.

'Maybe he's just spending a lot of time under water because he's found a good source of food,' said Mr Lay.

Vets at the Wellington Zoo and 
experts who have been tracking the penguin's progress all agreed that 
the next few days were critical.

'Hopefully, we'll all be pleasantly surprised,' said one official.

Happy Feet was named after the 2006 animated feature about a tap-dancing emperor chick.

He underwent four surgeries at 
Wellington Zoo to remove sticks and stones from his stomach and then 
spent two months in rehabilitation before being released into the ocean,
well short of his habitat.

An international treaty prevents authorities from returning the penguin directly to Antarctica, so he was released in an area where other juvenile emperor penguins like himself are at play at this time of the year.

Vet Lisa Argilla, who looked after 
Happy Feet at Wellington Zoo, said she was pleased when he had been 
released back into the Southern Ocean.

She
said: 'He slid down his specially-designed penguin slide backwards, but
once he hit the water he spared no time in diving off away from the 
boat and all those "aliens" who have been looking after him for so 
long.'

When Happy Feet had finally been given a clean bill of health, 
he was placed in a specially-designed crate filled with ice and loaded 
onto the research vessel Tangaroa.

Sea
conditions were too rough for Happy Feet to be released by hand, so he 
was placed on a tarpaulin slide running from the boat's ramp.

'He needed some gentle encouragement to leave his crate, but then the release went really well,' said Miss Argilla.

A team from the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research and the boat crew were all on deck to wave him goodbye.

'It's an indescribable feeling to see a patient finally set free,' said Miss Argilla.

Voyage leader Richard O'Driscoll told Wellington's The Press newspaper that apart from giving the veterinary team a few nips at feeding time, the penguin had been a well-behaved passenger.
