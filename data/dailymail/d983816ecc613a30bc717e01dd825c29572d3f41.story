A thrillseeker bedded down for the afternoon in a hammock attached to a tightrope high above the streets of Vienna.

Attaching his highwire between two buildings, one of which was the Austrian public aquarium in Hause de Meeres Zoo, he walked across the tightrope and secured his hammock 100ft off the ground.

Sleep tight, dont let the seagulls bite: Thrillseeker Igor Scotland rigged up his highline and secured a red and yellow hammock to it before enjoying some all-important me time

Igor Scotland, an urban adventurer, spent 12 hours getting into position before hunkering down, helped by and a photographer, Sebastian Wahlhitter.

Wahlhitter, 31, said: 'This place up there on the rooftop is so exposed and Igor attracted a lot of attention doing it.

'Although
 I am a climber and mountaineer myself, and quite used to heights and 
can deal with it pretty well, it did feel a little intimidating as the 
rooftop is so exposed and it was 100ft above ground.

'I am putting together a whole project to explore different urban spaces.'

Scotland is an active member of a height-conquering group called the 
Vienna Slackliners, who travel to remote spaces in Vienna to explore.

He
 said: The group is for all those who are crazy slackliners and have a 
desire to meet up with likeminded people in and around Vienna.

'Whether
 it's to organise joint balancing ventures or discuss all things 
swinging lines related, we're just there to meet cool people."

The rope was strung around the city's aquarium building, which has architecture that seems to lend itself to these stunts
