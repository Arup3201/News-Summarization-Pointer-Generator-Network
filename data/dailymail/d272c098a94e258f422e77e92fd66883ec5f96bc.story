The reintroduction of cursive handwriting lessons in North Carolina public schools has caused surprise unrest.

State representative, Pat Hurley who was behind the move, told Today this morning that she has received a number of 'personal' complaints from educators and parents.

One father-of-two telephoned her to tell her that handwriting is a 'total waste of time', while a teacher complained that 'these children will never use it in their lifetime.'

The write stuff: The reintroduction of cursive handwriting lessons into North Carolina public schools has caused surprise unrest, with parents and teachers deeming it 'outdated'

Before the bill, elementary schools were not required to teach cursive.

This is because the national Common Core Standards, rolled out in 2010 and adopted by 45 U.S. states, does not
 include it as part of the curriculum.

Instead students are required to 'demonstrate sufficient command of keyboarding skills.'

Ms Hurley, said she was inspired to push for the Back to Basics bill, after she received thank you notes from a group of fourth graders, following a field trip.

'It struck me as strange that they were not writing [in cursive],' she said.

'It was like these kids weren’t educated. I mean, this isn’t hieroglyphics we’re talking about.'

Thanks to her campaigning, the bill was passed on April 4 2013, drawing 107 yes votes with no dissenters.

However, now she has revealed that there has since been 'pushback' from the public.

Indeed, Joel Mathis expressed his opposition to writing lessons in an article for The Philly Post.

'We have machines to do this stuff for us. Who writes letters anymore?

'Except for signing my name to checks and legal documents, I’ve barely used cursive in 20 years . . . All my writing happens at a keyboard. This, I think, is progress.

'With so much to teach our students, maybe we should stick to the stuff they’ll actually find useful as workers and as citizens. Cursive isn’t really on that list.'

Others argue that while handwriting is important, cursive isn't.

Sign of the times: Today's school curriculum requires students to 'demonstrate sufficient command of keyboarding skills' and no guidelines on handwriting are included

Handwriting expert and instructor Kate Gladstone told Mashable: 'Teaching
 handwriting doesn’t mean it has to be cursive, any more than teaching 
math means it has to be in Roman numerals.'

She
 advocates for students learning to read cursive but opposes cursive 
handwriting mandates, saying that cursive writing should just be an 
elective.

Despite this, the majority appear to be on Ms Hurley's side.

'I don't think we’re in a world that is completely cursive free at this point. We need to prepare our students for the unknown future'

Tracey Neylon, a mother-of-two from Newport, Rhode Island., told Today that she thinks 'it’s important to be able to write it to be a functioning member 
of society.'

And Tessa Maguire, a third grade teacher in Michigan City, Indiana, pointed out: 'I don’t think we’re in a world that is completely cursive free at this point. We need to prepare our students for the unknown future.'

Meanwhile Hollywood actress, Kirstie Alley wrote on Twitter: 'I'm HORRIFIED to hear 
that American children will no longer learn CURSIVE!!!! AMERICAN 
children would not be able to read the CONSTITUTION.'

Studies have also highlighted how writing can 
help boost cognitive ability, memory and improve spelling.

California, Massachusetts and Georgia are other states which have requested that  a 
cursive writing requirement is reintroduced to schools.
