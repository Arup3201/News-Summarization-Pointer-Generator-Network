Manchester City could have Yaya Toure and Wilfried Bony in their ranks for this weekend’s title showdown with Chelsea.

The pair are currently on international duty with the Ivory Coast at the Africa Cup of Nations.

But after drawing their first two matches the pre-tournament favourites will be eliminated if they lose to Cameroon on Wednesday.

City have struggled without the midfield spark of Toure. They drew 1-1 at Everton and have lost their last two matches at home to Arsenal in the Premier League and Championship Middlesbrough in the FA Cup by a scoreline of 2-0.

They would welcome having the 31-year-old back in the ranks along with Bony, who has not yet played for the club since his £28milion signing from Swansea City shortly before the tournament kicked off.

In the event of a defeat for the Elephants both would be expected to fly back on Thursday.

That is unlikely to cause any problems for Manuel Pellegrini, given that his whole squad landed back from a mid-season trip to Abu Dhabi on Friday before taking on Boro on Saturday.

Meanwhile, winger Jesus Navas acknowledged that City need three points at Stamford Bridge after falling five behind Jose Mourinho’s league leaders.

‘The truth is we have a very important match now,’ he said. ‘Three points that would be very good for us so we need to go there and try to get them.’

The Spaniard believes the 5.30pm kick-off will be a spectacle.

Jesus Navas (centre) knows how important the title showdown is but also hopes for a great football spectacle 

‘I think it will be a beautiful match between two very big teams and I hope it will be a great football match,’ he explained.

Navas will be familiar with many of his opponents from his time with the Spain squad.

But he pointed out striker Diego Costa, who has 17 goals in 19 top-flight matches, as the danger man.

‘It’s been a long time since I spoke with them but Diego Costa is a very important player for them,’ he said.

‘He’s scoring lots of goals and he’s always proving his value, there and also in the Spanish national team.’
