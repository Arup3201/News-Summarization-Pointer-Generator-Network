Murdered: Jill Dando was killed in 1999

The shooting of Jill Dando on her doorstep remains one of Britain’s enduring murder mysteries.

But after 14 years, Scotland Yard has abandoned any hope of finding who killed the popular TV presenter.

The admission comes after one of the highest-profile police investigations in modern times and a ground-breaking £587,000 review of the case by the forensics firm which helped crack the murder of Stephen Lawrence.

The investigation has effectively been closed, and a number of former officers who worked on the case doubt whether the Yard will ever be able to prove who killed Miss Dando.

Miss Dando, 37, was shot dead outside her home in Fulham, West London, in April 1999.

A year later, unemployed loner Barry George was charged with her murder.

He was convicted in July 2001, but was acquitted at a retrial in August 2008.

Months later, senior officers ordered an exhaustive forensic review of the case which has finished with no leads identified.

In response to a Freedom of Information request from the Daily Mail, Scotland Yard has revealed that since Mr George’s acquittal police paid £587,383 to privately run LGC Forensics  for the review of the Jill Dando investigation.

Forensic experts subjected dozens of scenes of crime exhibits, including Miss Dando’s clothing, to state-of-the-art tests.

According to a number of sources, the possibility of a forensic breakthrough was hampered by what happened after Miss Dando was blasted in the head at point-blank range.

Although she died at once, paramedics ripped off her clothes and trampled over potentially vital evidence in a vain effort to resuscitate her.

Mystery: Jill was at the height of her fame when she was shot, and yet 14 years later, Scotland Yard has no leads on her killer and a review of the case has not seen any results

Scene: Jill was murdered with a single gunshot to her head from pointblank range on her own doorstep in Fulham, West London

The end of the inquiry emerged two 
months after convicted sex offender Mr George lost a bid for up to 
£500,000 compensation after two High Court judges ruled that another 
jury could have found him guilty. 

Released: Barry George spent eight years in prison after being wrongly convicted of Jill Dando's murder

They decided in January that Mr George, 52, who spent eight years in jail, was not eligible for damages as a victim of a ‘miscarriage of justice’.

Lord Justice Beatson and Mr Justice Irwin rejected his claim that the Justice Secretary unfairly and unlawfully decided that he was ‘not innocent enough to be compensated’.

Scotland Yard refused to comment on whether the review by LGC Forensics had uncovered any new leads.

But, pointedly, it confirmed that no officers are working full-time on the case.

A spokesman said: ‘This case remains unsolved and, as with all unsolved cases, any new information that comes to us would be examined.

'All unsolved cases remain open; our aim is always to try to solve all murders.’

Miss Dando was at the height of her fame when she died.

She fronted the Holiday programme and Crimewatch UK with close friend Nick Ross.

She was engaged to consultant Alan Farthing, who is now gynaecologist to the royal household and is overseeing the Duchess of Cambridge’s pregnancy.
