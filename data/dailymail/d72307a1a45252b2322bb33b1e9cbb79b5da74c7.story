The passport numbers of England's football squad have been published in an embarrassing security breach at the Sun Life Stadium.

An hour before Roy Hodgson's squad kicked off their friendly against Ecuador in Miami, the team sheets were passed around the press box as usual.

But at the same time, corporate sponsor Vauxhall tweeted the entire list, inadvertently publishing the personal information ahead of the game, which ended in a 2-2 draw.

Security breach: Stan Collymore tweeted a picture of the England team sheet - but it contained the players' passport details and went viral on social media. Team sponsor Vauxhall apologised

The signatures of midfielder Frank Lampard and and director of England team operations Michelle Farrar also ended up on social media.

The Football Association is aware of the situation and said it hopes the error will not be repeated when England take on Honduras at the same stadium on Saturday.

Embarrassing: Corporate sponsors Vauxhall swiftly retracted the tweet

Details of the Ecuadorian World Cup squad also ended up being published. Photographs of the sheet continue to circulate on social media, despite Vauxhall swiftly retracting the original post.

Football fans reacted on Twitter with a mixture of amusement and incredulity at the basic error.

The move was described as an 'absolute blunder' and criticised for being 'majorly stupid'.

Meanwhile England star-turned-pundit Gary Lineker made light of the situation, which he said could help the nation's world cup chances.

In reference to ever-more-tenuous statistics being bandied around to justify optimisim for the Three Lions' chances, he pointed out: 'England have never lost a World Cup in which the players' passport numbers were on a pre tournament friendly team-sheet.

A Vauxhall spokesman said: ‘We realised 
we made a mistake immediately and the tweet was deleted from our account
 within a minute. We have apologised to the FA for any embarrassment 
caused.’

Wayne Rooney ended his four-game international goal drought as an experimental England side drew 2-2 with Ecuador in a feisty World Cup warm-up match on Wednesday.

Both teams ended with 10 men at the Sun Life Stadium after Raheem Sterling was dismissed in the 79th minute for a sliding challenge on Ecuador winger Antonio Valencia, who saw red for pushing the Englishman and going to grab his throat.

The game petered out after explosion of tempers as the Brazil-bound teams settled for a draw.

Gaffe: Fans on Twitter responded to the inadvertent post

Error: One fan described the move as 'majorly stupid'

Weighing in: Gary Lineker used the opportunity to make a joke

The great concern for England coach 
Roy Hodgson will have been his team's defending, with Enner Valencia 
heading Ecuador in front in the 8th minute in Miami Gardens.

Rooney, though, leveled in the 29th 
by nudging the ball over the line after Rickie Lambert hit the post, and
 Lambert found the net himself six minutes into the second half after 
20-year-old Ross Barkley weaved his way through the defense with ease.

But Michael Arroyo powered in 
equalizer from distance in the 70th in his team's final game before 
playing Switzerland at the World Cup on June 15. England still has 
another friendly before its World Cup opener against Italy on June 14, 
against Honduras here on Saturday.
