Three youths who stabbed an innocent football fan to death then attacked
his father as he tended to his dying son are today facing years in prison.

The 15-strong gang attacked roofer Luke Fitzpatrick, 
25, after trying to storm a pub showing Chelsea’s victory over Bayern 
Munich in the Champions League.

They then turned on his father Bernard, 56, and stabbed him repeatedly in the stomach and legs as he cradled Luke in his arms.

Both were targeted just because they were part of the crowd watching the match at a pub in Dollis Hill, northwest London.

Christopher Walters, 23, from Neasden, and Loen Burton, 17, from Mill Hill, all north London, were found guilty of murder and wounding.

Abdi Hassan, 17, of Cricklewood, was found guilty of manslaughter and wounding.

Judge Rebecca Poulet lifted an anonymity order on the 17-year-olds saying: 'It is difficult to think of a more grave case.'

There were angry scenes in the courtroom today after the jury returned their verdicts.

Walters, 23, bragged 'life is life innit, 20, 30- years I’ll be out' and demanded to be sentenced straight away as he was convicted.

His remarks prompted angry scenes from the public gallery 
with Luke’s aunt shouting: 'What life did you give my nephew that night?

'What have you left us with? They took my beautiful nephew, we have to live with this for the rest of our lives.'

Walters
responded by shouting ‘For murder? do you know how many people were 
there. Don’t talk s*** blood’ as he was bundled down to the cells by 
prison guards.

The group was remanded in custody for sentencing on June 7 at the Old Bailey.

The father and son had been watching Chelsea win the Champions League final in their local pub, the Ox and Gate, in May last year.

Later, the pub was 'stormed' by at least 15 masked and hooded youths.

They were armed with knives, sticks, poles, and even a crutch, but 
were repelled by the drinkers who threw bar furniture at them before 
giving chase.

The attackers were looking for a man who had already left the pub in Dollis Hill, north London, to avenge Walters’ loss of face during an earlier incident.

Regulars at the pub chased the group 
out but as they reached Alder Grove, they turned and attacked Luke 
Fitzpatrick who was nearest to them.

Brian Altman QC, prosecuting, added: 'His father Bernard was stabbed several times as he was aiding his dying son where he had fallen.

'This
mindless violence led to a terrible and tragic outcome. An innocent 
young man lost his life and his father had to witness it.'

Mr Fitzpatrick had been stabbed in the abdomen and legs but had not died.

Mr
Altman said Walters was responsible for organising the disorder and had
led the group into the pub, uttering threats and brandishing a knife.

Earlier in the day, Walters had been involved in a row with the other man in the street.

It spread to a corner shop where staff ejected the second man and pulled the shutters down to shelter Walters.

Mr
Altman told the trial: 'Walters did not let matters rest there. He set 
about exacting his revenge by calling to arms his friends and 
associates.

'They stormed the pub. These were acts of cowardice, mob-handed and tooled up, to avenge Walters’ perceived loss of face.'

Mr Fitzpatrick’s mother Constance 
said in a statement she did not know why the group were allowed to 
terrorise the neighbourhood for so long.

She said she would never be able to forgive the killers of her 'shy and timid' loving son.

Mrs Fitzpatrick said the group of youths were always hanging around a corner shop.

She added: 'I feel angry they have been unchecked to roam the streets.

'They have been a violent and constant intimidating presence in this community.'

Friend Katy McKeon, 22, who has known him growing up, said: 'Luke was one of the nicest guys around, always looking after people, he
actually cared about people, a really nice, funny guy.

'The amount of flowers that are here just shows how loved he was, this has ruined this community.

'I was there on Saturday and it was like something out of a horror film.'

Michael
O’Rourke, 25, added: 'There is not one person who would say one bad 
word about him, he was one of the most loved people here.'

'He 
had never done a bad thing in his life but he can’t even go to the pub 
with his dad and have a pint without getting murdered. Luke was just the
nicest guy you could imagine, an absolute gent.'

Rafael Dejesus, 25, was found guilty of assisting an offender, and Ali Abdullah, 20, Mustafa Bereima, 20, Hamad Abdullah, 26 were found guilty of violent disorder. They will be sentenced with the others.
