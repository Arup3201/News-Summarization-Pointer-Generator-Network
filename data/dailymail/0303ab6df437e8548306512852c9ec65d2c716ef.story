A historic castle complete with its own watchtower, 14th century ruins and resident ghost has gone on sale for less than the price of an average semi-detached home in London.

Blenkinsopp Castle in Greenhead, Northumberland is on the market for just £325,000 despite boasting four bedrooms, two reception rooms, and the chance to own a piece of history.

While interior pictures show what could be any family home, views from the outside show the castle's turreted walls and stone masonry.

On the market: Belnkinsopp Castle, which comes complete with its own watchtower, 14th century ruins and resident ghost, has gone on sale for less than the price of an average semi-detached home in London

King of the castle: The Castle in Greenhead, Northumberland is on the market for just £325,000 despite boasting four bedrooms, two reception rooms, and the chance to own a piece of history

Sense of history: Included in the price are a set of 14th century medieval ruins that could have come straight from the set of a Hollywood film

Heritage: The castle was built in 1399 by the Blenkinsopp family, and has been used as a family home for centuries

According to Rightmove, the average price of a semi-detached home in London is £522,248, meaning homeowners who wanted to swap the city for the rolling countryside of Northumberland would come away with nearly £200,000 in change.

And included in the knock-down price are a set of 14th century medieval ruins that could have come straight from the set of a Hollywood film.

Built by the Blenkinsopp family in 1339, the Castle - which is around a mile from Hadrian's Wall - has served as a family home for centuries, while a hotel was added to it by William Lyle Blenkinsopp Coulson in the 1880s.

It comes complete with a Pele tower - a type of fortified watchtower that was added in the 19th century and is nestled in a tiny hamlet of 70 homes.

Members of the ancient Blenkinsopp family are said to have first taken possession of the land on which the castle was built prior to the Norman conquest. 

After the invasion, when land was shared out amongst the Normans no one wanted this particular area so the sitting tenant, Blencan, was allowed to keep it. The land is thought to have once been known as 'Blencan's Hope', meaning valley.

A Randolph de Blenkinsopp was recorded in the Pipe Rolls of Northumberland as owning land in the Haltwhistle area in 1240, and it is thought that he lived in a fortified manor house.

The castle is thought to have been built in 1339, and historical documents show that Thomas de Blecansopp was given a licence to crenellate, or fortify, the property in 1340. 

One of the family's medieval patriots, Bryan de Blenkinsopp, who held the castle some 600 years ago, was said to have a lust for wealth, and married a French woman who was plain, but possessed a chest of gold so heavy it took 12 men to carry it.

However, she would not tell Sir Bryan where she and her servants had hidden it, eventually causing him to quit the castle, leaving her behind.

Legend has it that, tortured by her actions, she was doomed to haunt the castle, and is known as the White Lady.

Members of the Blenkinsopp family lived in the castle for several centuries, but when it began to decay in the 16th century they left for their other properties at nearby Bellister Castle, near Haltwhistle, and Dryburnhaugh, near Greenhead.

By 1727 the castle was in ruins, and at around this time the Coulson family from Jesmond took ownership of the estate through marriage.

A new house was built on the site in the 1830s and the castle was rebuilt between 1877 and 1880 as a mansion, before it became a hotel. The building burned down in 1954 and although it was rebuilt, some of the ruins attached to the house had to be demolished as they were unsafe.

The castle even has its own ghost, and is said to be haunted by the widow of money-hungry Bryan de Blenkinsopp, who left her when she refused to tell him where she had buried her treasure chest.

The chest was never found and The White Lady is still said to roam the corridors. 

Despite being ravaged by a fire in 1954 when it was a guest house and having to be partly demolished, the castle has been lovingly restored and is now a Grade II listed imposing house fit for a lord or lady. 

Hidden comfort: From the inside the castle, which boasts this large castle, could be any well-appointed family home

Room with a view: The occupants of this bedroom, one of four in the castle, can wake up to views across the Northumberland countryside

A place to rest: The castle has two living rooms, including this one which also boasts views of the rolling countryside

Facilities: The castle has two bathrooms, one of which is an en-suite, and is described as a 'beautiful and practical family home'

'It’s an incredible property,' said Ailsa Mather from estate agent Andrew Coulson.

'The history of the place alone makes it worth the very ordinary price as well as the fact that it’s a beautiful and practical family home.

'I’m expecting a flurry of viewings as soon as people see what an amazing opportunity it is to own and live in a castle.'

Put your feet up: The castle's large sitting room has ample space to sit back and relax in front of a roaring fire

Haunting: The castle even has its own ghost, and is said to be haunted by the widow of money-hungry Bryan de Blenkinsopp, who left her when she refused to tell him where she had buried her treasure chest

Restored: Despite being ravaged by a fire in 1954 when it was a guest house and having to be partly demolished, the castle has been lovingly restored and is now a Grade II listed imposing house fit for a lord or lady
