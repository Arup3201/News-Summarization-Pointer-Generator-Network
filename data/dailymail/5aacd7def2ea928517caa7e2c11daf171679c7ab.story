A US marine was killed instantly when his parachute failed to open during a training exercise.

Caleb Medley, 26, died in a skydiving accident on Tuesday and was named today by officials.

He was declared dead at about 3pm after plummeting into a storage yard outside of the Perris Valley airport where the military exercise was taking place.

Medley, of Burlington, Colorado, was 
based at Camp Pendleton in San Diego County, California - one of the US 
Marine Corps' main bases.

Eric Kazakoff, CEO of Western Construction Auctions told the Press Enterprise that the skydiver landed in their 10-acre storage yard next to the skydiving centre in Riverside County.[related]

Several people on the property heard a very loud noise and rushed to see what had happened.

He said: 'It was awful. The parachute didnâ€™t open. There was not a lot anybody could do.'

Kazakoff said a member of the military quickly arrived and asked them to stay away.

Sgt Lisa McConnell, of the Riverside County sherriff's office, said Medley was part of a group of Marines taking part in a training exercise but was unable to say if there had been a problem with his parachute.

According to the Perris Valley Skydiving website, military personnel from around the world have been training at the site for the past decade.

The Press Enterprise reports that there have been at least 15 deaths at the site since 2000, with about 140,000 jumps taking place every year.
