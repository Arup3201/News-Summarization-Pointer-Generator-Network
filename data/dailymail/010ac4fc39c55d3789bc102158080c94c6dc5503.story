Warlord Joseph Kony's bloodthirsty Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) is slaughtering elephants at an unprecedented rate and trading their valuable tusks for bullets. 

The poaching of elephants in Garamba National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo is increasing rapidly, with more than 130 killed in the southern region in less than 12 months.

Poaching is not uncommon in African parks, but rangers at Garamba have made a worrying discovery - the ivory is helping fund the LRA's war.

Murdered: Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army is responsible for the slaughter of elephants in Garamba National Park

The poaching of elephants at Garamba National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo is increasing at an unprecedented  rate

Sasha Lezhnev, associate director of policy at the Enough Project, an organisation which works to end genocide and crimes against humanity, this month interviewed an LRA defector.

Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'It is very concerning the LRA are selling tusks to fund their operations.

'The elephant population in the Central African Republic parks and Garamba could be entirely decimated if the problem continues. In Garamba there are still elephants but poaching really has been on the rise.'

Mr Lezhnev, who returned from the DR Congo last week, has learned that a single elephant tusk can be traded for  18,000 bullets.

'They don't need guns, they have plenty of available guns, it's really bullets they need,' he added. 'It takes only one bullet to kill an elephant.'

The LRA - a violent rebel group led by Kony - is renowned for being one of the most brutal forces in the world. 

'Worrying': 'The elephant population in the Central African Republic parks and Garamba could be entirely decimated if the problem continues,' said Sasha Lezhnev, associate director of policy at the Enough Project. Park Rangers are pictured here with elephant corpses

They have become notorious for murder, mutilation, rape, widespread abductions of children and adults, and sexual slavery. 

The LRA first emerged in northern Uganda in 1986, where it claimed to fight in the name of the Acholi ethnic group against the government of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.

Over the years, the LRA has moved across the porous borders of the region: it shifted from Uganda to sow terror in southern Sudan before moving to northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, and finally crossing into southeastern Central African Republic in March 2008.

Combining religious mysticism with an astute guerrilla mind and bloodthirsty ruthlessness, leader Joseph Kony has turned scores of young girls into his personal sex-slaves while claiming to be fighting to impose the Bible's Ten Commandments.

As well as the rebel group, a recent report by the Enough Project revealed renegade elements of the Congolese national army and armed poachers from Sudan are responsible for the recent upsurge in poaching.

In the past, poachers have used very basic methods to slaughter the elephants, killing just one or two at a time. 

Now, heavily armed groups are using professional techniques and are bringing down three to eight of these majestic animals at a time. Their tusks are then cut off with chainsaws.

There is also evidence of at least nine of the 131 elephants killed in Garamba in the past 12 months being shot from helicopters. 

In May last year, ten elephants were murdered in one day alone in Garamba, according to African Parks, a conservation group that manages the park with Congolese authorities.

At Virunga National Park, also in the DR Congo, the elephant population has decreased by 90 per cent in the last twenty years, according to UNESCO.

High price: On the black market in Asia, elephants tusks are valued at between £13,300 and £117,000 depending on their size. These tusks have been seized from poachers

Mr Lezhnev stressed that rangers at the national park are working hard to prevent poaching, but they need more help.

Tracking poachers through the 3,000 sq-mile park is not only daunting, but dangerous, and rangers have been involved in deadly gun battles.

'A lot of the north region is not patrolled very well,' Mr Lezhnev said. 'The rangers are active but are severely under capacitated.

'To solve this problem, first of all the park rangers need significantly increased assistance. They have reported a pretty dramatic rise in poaching over the last decade.'

Killings: Elephant numbers in the national park have fallen dramatically to about 2,400 from approximately 20,000, largely due to poaching

One of the reasons for the increase in elephant poaching is likely to be the rise in the price of ivory, which is at a record high because of demand in parts of Asia, according to the Enough Project.

On the black market, elephants tusks are valued at between £13,300 and £117,000 depending on their size. 

Since the 1980s, the Garamba elephant population has fallen to about 2,400 from approximately 20,000, largely due to poaching. 

Mr Lezhnev added: 'If not enough action is taken, we could see the entire elephant population eliminated from these regions in the next 10 years.'

Help needed: Rangers (pictured) at Garamba are active, but need more help to tackle the problem, Mr Lezhnev said
