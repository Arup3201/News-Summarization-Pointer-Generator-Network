A man convicted 21 years ago of child abuse involving satanic rituals at a day care he ran with his wife was freed Thursday amid questions about the evidence in the case.

Dan Keller was released on bond barely a week after the release of his now ex-wife, Fran.

The Kellers were convicted and sentenced to 48 years each in 1992, after therapists testified that they helped three children recover memories of satanic rituals and sexual abuse at an Austin preschool the couple operated out of their home.

Free: Dan Keller, 72, was released from jail on Thursday after spending 21 years behind bars for child abuse which he claimed he never committed. His ex-wife was released from her charges last week

The only physical evidence came from an emergency room doctor who testified that internal lacerations on one child were evidence of abuse. But in court documents filed earlier this year, Dr. Michael Mouw says what he thought were lacerations were actually normal physiology.

That prompted prosecutors in Travis County, which includes Austin, to agree that the case's evidence was faulty and release the couple on bond.

The couple, who have always maintained their innocence, hope that appeals courts will now exonerate them.

Mr Keller, 72, was met outside the county jail by his ex-wife, 63, who was released November 26.

The pair - who divorced while in prison, but who remain close - hugged warmly.

Dan Keller told reporters he wasn't bitter and planned to spend his first moments of freedom grabbing a cheeseburger.

Dr Mouw said in an affidavit 
presented to court this year that he had little training at the time on 
how to examine sexual abuse in children and came to the wrong 
conclusions in examining a child in the Keller case.

'While
my testimony was based on a good faith belief at that time, I now 
realize my conclusion is not scientifically or medically valid, and that
I was mistaken,' he said in the affidavit.

The Kellers were convicted of 
sexually abusing a 3-year-old girl in their care and faced accusations 
of dismembering corpses, putting blood in Kool-Aid and flying children to Mexico where they would be sexually abused by soldiers.

Mouw provided the only physical evidence in the case, telling the jury that lacerations on one of the alleged victims was indication of sexual abuse.

He later learned that those slight lacerations were actually normal physiology.

'There is a reasonable likelihood that (the medical expert's) false testimony affected the judgment of the jury and violated Frances Keller's right to a fair trial,' said Rosemary Lehmberg, the district attorney for Travis County, which is located in central Texas and includes the city of Austin.

Fran
Keller's attorney, Keith Hampton, said: 'The case was a true witch hunt
because the investigators actually believed that this was part of a 
wide satanic conspiracy.'

He said the therapist's techniques — 
which were used to convince the children, parents and investigators that
the Kellers committed human sacrifices, sexually abused them with pens and dismembered human bodies in cemeteries — have been debunked.

The Kellers were sentence after just a six day trial, according to KUT. The couple were among hundreds of childcare workers who
were accused of being part of a group of Satan worshipers who engaged 
in ritual child abuse across America during the 1980s and 1990s.

'The Keller case is definitely about the panic back then,' said Hampton.

Between 1984 to 1989, some 100 people
nationwide were charged with ritual sex abuse and 50 were put on trial,
according to Debbie Nathan of the National Center for Reason and 
Justice, which works to free those wrongly imprisoned.

Many
have since questioned a number of the cases, which they said were based
on faulty testimony coaxed out of children from purported experts on 
recovered memories and backed by dubious medical testimony on signs of 
sexual abuse.
