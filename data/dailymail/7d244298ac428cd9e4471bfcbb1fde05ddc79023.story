The bodies of an elderly woman, her son and his friend have been found in what appears to be a double-murder suicide - but police are struggling to find a motive for the killings.

Gloria Bono, 72, and her son Michael Bono, 45, were found dead with multiple gunshot wounds at a property in the luxury Yacht and Country Club in Stuart, Florida, yesterday.

The body of Robert Gulick - who is believed to be Michael's friend - was discovered  at a Best Western hotel room on Sunday, with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Investigators believe Gulick killed the Bonos before turning a gun on himself, WPTV reported. 

Martin County Sheriff Will Snyder told the news channel that police found Gloria Bono's car parked at the Best Western, after receiving a phone call from her daughter.

The woman said she had not heard from her mother or brother for several hours and she was concerned for their safety.

'With a little more investigation they found out that the person who had driven that car was at a room at the Best Western,' Snyder said. 'Stuart police made entry to the room and found Mr Gulnick deceased.'

'It appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound, he added.

'So we began helping them in a search that ultimately led us to here the Stuart Yacht and Country Club, where we found Mrs Bono and her son deceased apparently shot multiple times.'

Neither of the victims lived in the home, but it is thought that Gulnick occasionally did maintenance work for the property so may have had access to the luxury gated community.

Investigators believe that the Bonos may have been at the residence after arranging to meet Gulnick there.

The owner of the property lives out of state and told police that no one should have been in the home at the time of the killings, The Palm Beach Post reported.

Police believe that Gulnick and Michael Bono were friends, but they have not yet identified a motive for the killings.

Snyder said he believed more would be known after an autopsy later today.

He added: 'They were apparently together last night and why the Bonos were shot and killed here is something we are still working on.

'So it's really not possible for us right now to determine a motive. And why they were shot we don't know.'
