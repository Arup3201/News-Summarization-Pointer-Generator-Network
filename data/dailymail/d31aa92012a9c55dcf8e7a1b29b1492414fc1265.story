A Turkish professor has created a bizarre artwork made from the severed heads of cows to draw attention to outbreaks of violence at the university where he works.

Dr Mehmet Kavukcu, a lecturer on photography at Ataturk University in the city of Erzurum, created his brutal work by placing 15 cow heads onto a large cube-shaped ice sculpture.

The professor says the heads, which he purchased from a local slaughterhouse, have already had a positive impact on students who last year made national headlines when a group attacked police officers in a university canteen.

Bizarre: Dr Mehmet Kavukcu placed 15 severed cow heads onto an ice sculpture that was itself built onto an iron frame. The artwork was created to raise awareness about violence at the university where he works

Brutal: Dr Kavukcu, a lecturer on photography at Ataturk University in the city of Erzurum, created his work by placing 15 cow heads onto a large cube-shaped ice sculpture

The ice sculpture is built around a large iron frame which is suspended from the ceiling using a crane.

The shocking artwork has been assembled directly outside Ataturk University's Faculty of Fine Arts building, with local media saying it is fascinating and terrifying passers-by in equal measure.

In a statement, Dr Kavukcu said he used 
oxen as they are a symbol of power and prosperity in Turkish culture, 
with the severing of the heads representing how easily violence can 
dismantle that.

The professor says the heads have already had a positive impact on students after violence incidents last year

Dr Kavukcu says the project has already reached its goal of raising awareness about violence in Turkey

He said he placed the heads on an ice sculpture rather than directly onto the iron frame in order to project the potency of the fear of violence through the intensity of cold.

Dr Kavukcu went on to say that he feels the project has already reached its goal of raising awareness about violence in Turkey, something he says he is very pleased about.
