Utility crews working around the clock on Wednesday labored to clean up and repair damage from a major water main break that unleashed a 40-foot-tall (12-meter-tall) geyser and flooded part of the University of California campus in drought-stricken Los Angeles.

The late-afternoon rupture on Tuesday beneath Sunset Boulevard, a key thoroughfare on the city's west side, opened a gaping sinkhole in the street and sent an estimated 8 million to 10 million gallons of water gushing across the north end of the UCLA campus for several hours.

It took crews from the Department of Water and Power some 3.5 hours to halt most of the water flow, though shutoff valves were still stuck partially open and water continued to drain into the work area as of Wednesday morning, slowing repair efforts, DWP officials said.

Awash: Crews began pumping out water immediately on Tuesday night after some of the millions of gallons of fresh water inundated the UCLA basketball stadium

The torrent flooded several campus buildings, including the basketball court at UCLA's newly renovated Pauley Pavilion, swamped the school's track stadium and inundated the underground floors of two parking structures.

Millions of gallons of water flowed across the school's athletic facilities, including the famed floor of Pauley Pavilion, the neighboring Wooden Center and the Los Angeles Tennis Center, and a pair of parking structures that took the brunt of the damage.

The arena - where Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Walton, Reggie Miller and Kevin Love starred and John Wooden coached for 10 years - recently underwent a $132 million renovation that was completed in October 2012.

UCLA Assistant Vice Chancellor Kelly Schmader suggested Wednesday that Pauley Pavilion may well make it out of this without catastrophic damage.

Things got ugly: The 30-inch pipe burst beneath Sunset Boulevard, sending a geyser many feet into the air and shutting down the major thoroughfare and causing chaos on UCLA campus

Sinkhole: The pipe left a 15-foot crater in Sunset Boulevard in addition to about 10 million gallons of wasted water to clean up

'We’re currently in the drying process,' he told KTLA. He said, despite the 8-10 inches of water that were there last night, the floor is 'showing  little signs of buckling and expansion.'

Firefighters dispatched to the scene helped five people to safety on Tuesday as water poured into the garage buildings, and no injuries were reported.

Several hundred cars remained stuck in the two parking facilities, which have been closed while damage is assessed, school officials said. A stretch of Sunset Boulevard also was shut down for repairs.

Aftermath: A parking structure is shown Wednesday after the water receded. Workers worked around the clocked into Wednesday dealing with the massive cleanup

Precious items: Carpet has been pulled up and fans dry the floor at the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame in the J.D. Morgan Center Wednesday

Still flowed: Smaller leaks filled the repair site even after the main was shut off, hampering repair efforts on Wednesday

Pushing water: The process of cleaning up UCLA began before the pipe was even shut off and will likely continue for months

DWP spokesman Albert Rodriguez said crews working through the night had finished removing mud and debris by morning, and that the cause of the rupture was under investigation.

The 93-year-old riveted steel pipe, 30 inches in diameter, normally carries an estimated 75,000 gallons of water per minute from a reservoir to L.A.'s Westwood neighborhood and appears to have broken at the junction of another water trunk line, the utility said.

DWP general superintendent for water distribution Jeff Bray described the repair process to KTLA as 'very complex.'

'The location of the leak is creating issues for us as far as the location of the pipe,' he told the CW affiliate.' Normally, a break of this size, we would just go in and cut out a section of pipe and replace it real quick. But this is located where two large-diameter pipes come together.'

The rupture underscored the aging condition of much of the city's infrastructure. The DWP predicted in 2012 that 1.4 million feet of its water delivery pipeline, or 27 percent of the total, would be at least a century old by this year, according to the Los Angeles Times.

The mishap occurred as California suffers through a record drought that has prompted state and local authorities to impose strict water conservation measures, including fines for wasting even a few gallons on excessive lawn irrigation.
