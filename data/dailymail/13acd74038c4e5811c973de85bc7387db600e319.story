Jose Pekerman has told his Colombia side to ignore the hype around Luis Suarez as they prepare for the biggest game in their history.

The coach, who has brilliantly guided his free-scoring team into today’s last-16 clash, knows Suarez’s ban could be a distraction in the build-up.

Pekerman said: ‘It is a very delicate issue. It seems to me that our concern is Uruguay and we are working hard to deal with them.

‘Uruguay are highly respected. We knew the possibility of playing them, they are always top-notch. We have to be ready. 

‘Playing them motivates us. We have huge respect for Uruguay’s history, we have to continue moving ahead.’

Colombia keeper David Ospina, who plays his club football in France with Nice, claims Uruguay can overcome the loss of Suarez.

Ospina said: ‘All national teams have difficulties. We had difficulties, but that is why it is down to all members of the team to have the ability and skill to overcome any difficulty.’

Pekerman also claimed Uruguay are under pressure to win today’s match after coming through a difficult group with England, Italy and Costa Rica.

The Colombia coach said: ‘The big teams must prove why they are so big, why they have won things and why they are so valued.

‘In countries such as ours, which hasn’t competed at the World Cup for so long, we must show our willingness and ambitions. 

‘We must know how to compete and we are doing quite well.

‘This is a huge test for us. For Colombia this is going to be a demanding test. We will have to show that we can compete.’
