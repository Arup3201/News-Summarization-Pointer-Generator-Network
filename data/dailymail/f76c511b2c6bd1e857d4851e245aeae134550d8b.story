Former First Daughter, Jenna Bush Hager celebrated Halloween by dressing up her five-month old daughter in an astronaut costume.

Her dad, former President George W. Bush was seen holding little Mila in a cute NASA outfit.

Jenna tweeted that her father was discussing astronomy with the baby girl.

For the former President, it will almost certainly have brought back fond memories of his time in office.

President Bush championed NASA and its technologies unveiling a new vision for space exploration back in 2004, calling on NASA to 'gain a new foothold on the moon and to prepare for new journeys to the worlds beyond our own.'

Had the funding for the Space Program not been slashed by President Obama, a planned mission to the moon would have been ready for launch next year.

He'll instead have to keep his dreams invested in his granddaughter and enjoy playing space cadets here on Rarth.

After conducting a space walk with the rookie, it was time to hand control of the mission to former First Lady Laura Bush as she took little Mila on a walk on the outdoor patio.

Given the Halloween festivities it looks as though it was treats all-round for the family.

Meanwhile, the current President and First Lady greeted adorable children at the White House in the annual festivities.

The revellry was a bit more ghoulish in New York, as the 40th annual Greenwich Village Parade returned to the city after a year off in 2012 because of the damage that happened during Hurricane Sandy.

While the parade that rolled up New York's Sixth Avenue was made up largely of adults given the later start time, the White House party was all about the kids.

The fake insects could be seen slithering down from the Truman Balcony along the South Portico, where haystacks and nearly 200 pumpkins dotted the lawn for the annual White House Halloween event.

The goods: The gift bags were filled with a box of M&Ms with the seal of the President, a bag of dried fruits and a sugar cookie baked by the White House pastry chef

Leveling with them: In the past, the President joked that if they only handed out healthy treats the White House might get egged by angry children

President
Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, clad in orange and black, 
emerged in the evening to greet the zombies, wizards and superheroes 
waiting diligently to hear the president's response to an eerie query: 
Trick or treat?

Thousands of packages of jelly beans, dried fruit and White House Sweet Dough Butter Cookies were doled out to the thousands of children who came to the White House for their Halloween celebrations.

The President and Mrs. Obama handed the goods out to children as they walked across the South Lawn, past stilt-walkers, jugglers and a giant, transparent bubble housing Glinda the Good Witch, who brandished her magic wand in true Wizard-of-Oz fashion.

Fog billowed across the lawn, 
obscuring the Washington Monument in the distance as children and their 
parents mingled with White House staffers dressed as football players, 
vampires and princesses.

A 
brass band of white-faced skeletons set the mood with creepy Halloween 
tunes, dancing as they played alongside a family of ghosts camped out 
near the area where the president's helicopter normally lifts off.

Even the president's dogs donned 
costumes - no, not the real Sunny and Bo, but topiaries carved from 
ribbons and pipe cleaners and dressed up, Bo as a pirate and Sunny as a 
sunflower.

Seasonal: Barack and Michelle avoided actual costumes and opted in favor for black-and-orange outfits

Treats: The baggies with three different items were similar to the ones that the Obamas handed out in the past

The festivities marked the return of a favorite annual tradition at the White House that had to be scrapped last year.

After
three straight years of passing out goodies, rain or shine, Obama and 
the first lady canceled the event last year because of Superstorm Sandy,
which had walloped the East Coast earlier in the week.

More than 5,000 people took part in this year's event, the White House said.

One of the biggest annual parades wrapped up in New York City's Greenwich Village at around 11pm.

The final headcount for the storied mile-long celebration has not been reported but there were no major police incidents. The official number of arrests will not be reported until around 2am local time.

This was the parade's 40th year and it was expected to be extra raucous because it was cancelled last year due to Hurricane Sandy.

The superstorm hit the North East- badly damaging parts of New York City- just days before Halloween so officials made the decision not to redirect police services from rescue operations to security at the parade route.

Because of the money lost by cancelling the parade at the last minute after the storm, the organizers had no money left to fund the event.

'We asked for grants, we hoped the Bloomberg foundation would give us some money, but nothing was happening,' organizer Jeanne Fleming told the Associated Press.

They were saved by a Kickstarter campaign that raised $55,000 and let the show go on.

Additional help came from sympathetic business owners, like those who gave them discounted insurance rates.

'We found the people who think of community. That felt really good to us. They were committed to helping us do it. They think beyond themselves, the think "This matters for my city, and I'm going to step up."'
