Manchester City still hope that Vincent Kompany and David Silva could be fit to face Roma in next week’s Champions League decider in Italy.

Kompany suffered a hamstring injury in last weekend’s win over Hull and will miss Saturday’s clash with Everton at the Etihad, while Silva has been out for the last five weeks with a knee injury.

But manager Manuel Pellegrini believes both have an outside chance of being available for the crucial Group E game in Rome.

There was another boost for City with Edin Dzeko and Aleksandar Kolarov fit again to face Everton after injury. Stevan Jovetic will miss the match but Yaya Toure is in the squad despite missing training on Friday with a sore throat.

‘Vincent is not in the squad list but he’s working,’ said the City boss. ‘We will have a test on him on Monday or Tuesday.

‘Silva could play but it would be a risk and I don’t think it would be good to take a risk in the last days of his recovery.

‘I don’t know how much of a possibility it is (that they could both play) but it’s possible.

‘Dzeko and Kolarov are in the squad. Edin is 100 per cent. Yaya didn’t work today just as a precaution but there is no problem for tomorrow and he is in the squad list.’
