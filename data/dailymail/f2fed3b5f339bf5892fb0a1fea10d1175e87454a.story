Tinder chief executive Sean Rad is at the centre of new revelations in the company's sexual harassment case for allegedly sending a text message describing his boss as a penis.

A lawsuit filed by former executive Whitney Wolfe, 24, claimed she was forced from the company and sexually harassed after her relationship with co-founder and chief marketing officer Justin Mateen fell apart.

However, Rad's text message is one of a number of incidents the lawsuit claims were an example of the 'misogynist, alpha-male stereotype too often associated with technology startups'.

Tinder chief executive and co-founder Sean Rad, left, is alleged to have sent a message describing his boss Barry Diller as a penis, in what the lawsuit cited as an example of the alpha-male stereotype at the company

Rad is said to have sent the message about IAC/InterActiveCorp chairman Barry Diller during a 
meeting with executives from the IAC company which owns Tinder.

The NYPost reported Rad texted Miss Wolfe a photo of a piece of paper with Diller's name written across the top of the page, followed by the letters 'AKA' underneath it.

Below this were Diller's initials 'BD', drawn in the shape of a penis.

It was reported Rad would be safe within the company, despite his role in the company's current controversy.

When approached for comment, a Tinder spokesman sent MailOnline a statement in which Rad told internal staff he wish he had 'done more in terms of managing what was clearly a complex situation'.

It read: 'The communications between Justin and Whitney that have come to my attention through this process are just unacceptable.

'However, as many of you know, Whitney’s legal complaint is full of factual inaccuracies and omissions. We did not discriminate against Whitney because of her age or gender, and her complaint paints an inaccurate picture of my actions and what went on here.'

Rad is named in Miss Wolfe's lawsuit as standing by and doing nothing while she was being forced out.

She claims she was called a w**** by Mateen in front of Rad and that she was stripped of her co-founder title because Mateen told her that having a '24-year-old girl' co-founder made the company 'seem like a joke.'

The lawsuit claims Mateen and Rad subjected her to a 'barrage of horrendously sexist, racist and otherwise inappropriate comments, emails and text messages'.

The suit says that Wolfe, centre, was forced out of the company after her affair with Mateen, left, soured and she complained to Rad, right, who did nothing

According to the suit, Miss Wolfe was a 'driving force behind Tinder from the very beginning...even before there was a Tinder, Wolfe was a key player on the team that produced the wildly successful dating app'.

The suit credits her with suggesting the name - 'because tinder helps to light a flame, which had obvious dating analogues'.

She first crossed paths with Mateen in September 2012 when Rad offered his long-term friend a two months contract with the start-up.

In November 2012, Miss Wolfe was officially recognised as a co-founder and that same month, she alleges, 'Mr Mateen began pursuing a romantic relationship' with her', though the couple didn't start dating until the following February.

However, as the company's fortunes boomed Mateen and Miss Wolfe's relationship was floundering.

She alleges that he grew 'verbally controlling and abusive', that he accused her of 'destroying his power at the company' by virtue of the fact that they had a similar title - she as VP (vice president) of marketing and co-founder, he as CMO (chief marketing officer) and co-founder.
