With swathes of cloud covering almost one side of the planet, you'd be forgiven for mistaking this image for a primitive weather map of a section of Earth.

But this is a weather forecast with a difference.

NASA scientists have mapped cloud cover on a planet outside of the solar system for the first time.

The image offers a first look at clouds on hot Jupiter-like planet Kepler-7b which is some 1,000 light-years away from the Earth.

The extraordinary map was put together using three years of data from NASA's Spitzer and Kepler space telescopes which have been studying the planet - known as an exoplanet.

The low resolution map suggests that the planet is covered in high clouds in the west and has relatively clear skies in the east.

The data was collected after the Kepler telescope spent just under seven days monitoring the planet and spotted a mystery bright spot on its western hemisphere.

Kepler-7b was one of the first exoplanets discovered by the Kepler telescope.

It orbits a star which is slightly hotter than the Sun and although the planet is about half the mass of Jupiter, it is nearly one-and-a-half times the size.

It has been likened to Jupiter, but it is hotter.Kepler-7b orbits its host star every seven days at a distance of around 5.6million miles away.

The planet's discovery was announced in January 2010.

Scientists were unable to tell whether the spot was caused by heat or clouds and sent Spitzer in to keep tabs on the planet's temprature.

Readings estimated the temperature to be between about 800C and 1,000C, a relatively cool temperature for a planet that orbits so close to its star and, according to astronomers, too cool to be the source of light Kepler observed.

Scientists were therefore able to discern that the spot was light from the planet's host star reflecting back off the top of clouds.

Brice-Olivier Demory of Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, said: 'By observing this planet with Spitzer and Kepler for more than three years, we were able to produce a very low-resolution "map" of this giant, gaseous planet.

'We wouldn't expect to see oceans or continents on this type of world, but we detected a clear, reflective signature that we interpreted as clouds."

'Kepler-7b reflects much more light than most giant planets we've found, which we attribute to clouds in the upper atmosphere,' said Thomas Barclay, Kepler scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California.

Extra terrestrial: Kepler-7b was one of the first planets outside of our solar system to be discovered by the Kepler telescope

'Unlike those on Earth, the cloud patterns on this planet do not seem to change much over time -- it has a remarkably stable climate.'

The Kepler telescope has discovered more than 150 confirmed planets outside the solar system.

The telescope's problematic reaction wheels prevent it from hunting planets any more, but astronomers continue to pore over almost four years' worth of collected data from the planets already discovered.

It is hoped that the same cloud-mapping techniques can be used to observe smaller Earth-like worlds.
