Anthony Joshua has warned his heavyweight rivals to concentrate on their own careers rather than cling to his coat tails.

The Olympic champion has won his first nine professional fights by knockout and faces veteran Michael Sprott in Liverpool on Saturday.

And the 25 year old urged the likes of Eddie Chambers, Tyson Fury and David Price to plot their own route to the top.

‘Chambers, since he fought the other week, has gone silent,’ Joshua said. ‘His performance didn’t live up to what he spoke about.

‘Tyson should concentrate on his fight on November 29 and Price should concentrate on his fight on December 6.

‘They should concentrate on getting titles so they have something to lose by the time I’m at their heels.

‘As for me it’s one step at a time, this is my tenth fight.’

Joshua has yet to hear the bell for the start of the fourth round but expects a tough test against 39-year-old Sprott.

‘You can never look past anyone, especially at heavyweight,’ he added.

‘I’ve watched videos of some of his fights, he’s experienced and he was a contender. ‘He’s mixed it at a high level with the likes of Kubrat Pulev who fought Wladimir Klitschko the other night.

‘I’m sure he’s training hard. I can’t say I’ve had the greatest camp ever or the worst camp, I’ve just been ticking over because I haven’t left the gym.

‘I’m feeling confident because being active, not only am I getting rounds under my belt, but I’ve experienced the pressure and the spotlight.’

Liverpool’s Echo Arena has witnessed its fair share of heavyweight shocks after Price twice lost to Tony Thompson last year.

The 25-year-old is also an Olympic champion, having won gold at London 2012

And Sprott insists he can derail the Joshua hype train.

‘I’ve boxed a lot of big men and I always do better with big men than ones my own size,’ he said.

‘This is my 55th professional fight and I’ve been fighting for 20 years so there’s nothing he can show me. I’ve been in with some good opponents, I’ve been stopped, I’ve been knocked out.

‘I don’t turn anyone down and it’s a great opportunity. I beat him and a lot of doors open.

‘He’s done well, they’re bringing him on slowly But look what happened to David Price.

‘He’s a world-class puncher but they got carried away and put him in with Tony Thompson. I said that was a big mistake and I was right.

‘They’ve got to be careful who they put him [Joshua] in with and shouldn’t get carried away.

‘When I take fights I feel I can cause an upset.’
