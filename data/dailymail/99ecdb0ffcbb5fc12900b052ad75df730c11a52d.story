Parents should get a job rather than rely on handout if they want to lift their children out of poverty, Iain Duncan Smith will declare today.

The Work and Pensions Secretary will insist that employment, not a few extra pounds in welfare benefits, is the key to lifting families out of poverty, as he unveils plans to replace all other out of work benefits from 2013, with the Coalition’s new universal credit.

Mr Duncan Smith claims the reform will remove incentives to stay on welfare rather than moving into work.

New targets: Iain Duncan Smith

Mr Duncan Smith will also announce 
plans to tear up the method of measuring child poverty by family 
income, introduced under Labour, insisting that determining children’s 
wellbeing simply on the basis of income can be perverse.

He will claim that research shows that giving money could in fact do more 
harm than good, for example by fuelling drug addiction or removing the 
incentive to find employment.

‘Our latest analysis suggests that 
universal credit will ensure the vast majority of children will be 
lifted out of poverty if at least one parent works 35 hours a week at 
the minimum wage – or 24 hours if they are a lone parent,’ he will say 
today.

‘If people take steps with us to find and stay in employment, they will see the rewards.

‘With the right support a child 
growing up in a dysfunctional household, who was destined for a lifetime
on benefits could be put on an entirely different track – one which 
sees them move into fulfilling and sustainable work.’

Official figures, to be published this
morning, are expected to show that despite tens of billions of pounds 
being poured into welfare, Labour failed to meet its aim of halving 
child poverty by 2010/11.

The last government’s measure of 
poverty – children living in households with an income below 60 per cent
of median earnings – was enshrined in law.

Mr Duncan Smith will announce that the
Government is to scrap the measure and consult on broader ways of 
calculating children’s life chances. These could include whether their 
parents are in employment, drug and alcohol addiction in the home, 
family debts, truancy rates and other factors.

The move will prompt outrage from 
Labour, which will accuse the Government of deliberately changing the 
goalposts to mask the impact of its austerity policies.

But the Work and Pensions Secretary 
will deride his predecessor’s approach of supposedly tackling poverty by
boosting income just over an arbitrary line and declaring that a 
child’s life chances have thereby been transformed.

‘The last government spoke about the 
need to tackle poverty, and poured vast amounts of money into the 
pursuit of this ambition,’ he will say in a speech.

‘£150 billion was spent on tax credits
alone between 2004 and 2010. Overall, the welfare bill increased by 
some 40 per cent in real terms, even in a decade of rising growth and 
rising employment.

‘Yet for all the extra money, the earlier and easier successes were followed by flatlining results.

‘The Institute for Fiscal Studies has
been clear that the previous government are likely to have missed their
target to halve child poverty by 2010.’

Labour's work and pensions spokesman Liam Byrne said that behind Cameron's proposals were an abandonment of parents and children

Mr Duncan Smith will dismiss the 
‘overwhelming’ focus on family income, adding: ‘If a family has less 
than 60 per cent of the median income it is said to be poor, if it has 
60 per cent or more it is not.

‘By this narrow measure, if you have a
family who sit one pound below the poverty line you can do a magical 
thing. Give them one pound more, say through increased benefit payments,
and you can apparently change everything – you are said to have pulled 
them out of poverty.

‘Of course money is important and will
always play a part in future measurements of poverty. But increased 
income from welfare transfers is temporary if nothing changes.

‘Just take the example of a poor 
family where the parents are suffering from a drug addiction. Giving the
parents extra money moves them over the line and out of “poverty” on 
paper.

‘Yet because much of the money will 
almost certainly go on drugs, the family still lives in poverty. Coming 
off drugs is therefore a vital step for them getting out of poverty.

‘Or take a family where no one has 
ever worked. Simply increasing the household’s income – while taking no 
other proactive action – will only push the family further into 
dependency and weaken the incentive to take up work.’

Mr Duncan Smith will argue that for 
some, including people with severe disabilities, income from the state 
will always play a vital role.

The Coalition’s new universal credit, 
which will replace all other out of work benefits from 2013, will remove
incentives to stay on welfare rather than moving into work.

Labour’s work and pensions spokesman 
Liam Byrne said: ‘In a great country like Britain we should stand behind
parents fighting to bring up their children free of the curse of 
poverty.

‘Behind Cameron’s promises we learn 
today that those parents and their children will now be abandoned and 
told, “you are on your own”.’
