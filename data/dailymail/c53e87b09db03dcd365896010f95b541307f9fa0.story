World Cup-winning defender Gerard Pique looks set to snub a move to the Premier League after revealing he has no intention of leaving Barcelona.

Pique has played in just eight of Barcelona's 15 games this season, and has not featured for Luis Enrique's side since their 3-1 loss to rivals Real Madrid back in October 

Reports in Spain had linked the 27-year-old with a move to Chelsea, Manchester City or former club Manchester United, but that now appears unlikely with the Spain international reaffirming his commitment to his current club.

'I think not to play two or three matches (and then leave) would not be consistent,' he told Movistar TV. 

'Barcelona is my life and I do not plan to leave. I will continue to fight for a place.'

Some reports  suggested the relationship between the Pique and his manager has been strained, but the former United man remained tight-lipped on the subject.

He said: 'It's a player-coach relationship, he is the one who decides and players try to do what he wants from us.' 

National coach Vicente del Bosque has kept faith with Pique, though, picking him in both the defeat to Slovakia and their recent win against Luxembourg. Next up for the reigning European champions is a clash with Belarus on Sunday.
