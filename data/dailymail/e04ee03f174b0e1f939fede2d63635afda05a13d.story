Max Clifford's ex-wife revealed today she caught him having phone sex on their honeymoon.

Jo Westwood, 51, who divorced the 71-year-old  18 days after he was jailed, said she confronted him about the 'explicit call' but he laughed and called it a 'game'.

Miss Westwood, who was speaking about their marriage for the first time, also revealed that her ex-husband, who she married four years ago, was trying to woo women in the run up to his trial.

Anguish: Miss Westwood revealed that her ex-husband had phone sex on their honeymoon and was wooing other women in the run up to his trial

Discussing their honeymoon she told ITV’s This Morning today: 'We were on a beach and Max said he had to go back to the room. He was gone a very long time and I became suspicious so went back too.

'He was on the phone having a phone call of an explicit nature. He denied it but I said I could tell him what he said word for word. He then said it was a game'. 

The millionaire celebrity publicist, who was jailed for eight years for sexually abusing teenage girls, kept sickening mementos from women he encountered during his 50-year career.

Miss Westwood met Clifford while she worked as his personal assistant and were married for four years, living in West London 

When asked why she did not go to court to support him she said: 'I had thought about it, seriously, because I knew it would be better for him if I was there.

'But then in the run up to the trial he continued to wine and dine these girls. I just thought he’s just showing me no respect at all'.

She also said that Clifford boasted about a bin bag of sexual photographs of women he kept at his £3.5million mansion. 

He told his wife: ‘I just used to be able to get women to do whatever I wanted.’

Discussing his private stash of pornographic photographs she said it was ‘something he was proud to have’.

‘I felt very uncomfortable about it. It was a bag full of photographs of women.

‘I made it very clear to him that I didn’t like them being in the house and he put them somewhere, I don’t know where.

‘Some of them had faces but a lot of them didn’t… and they were sexual. And when I said to him, “How did you get all these?”, he would say, “I just used to be able to get women to do whatever I wanted”.’

Miss Westwood, who worked as his personal assistant before they married four years ago, also told investigative journalist Mark Williams-Thomas of her shock on discovering a letter from one of Clifford’s victims, which would later trigger his downfall.

The woman, now using the pseudonym Cathy Johnson, wrote anonymously in 2011 asking him if he was proud of being a child abuser after she endured four months of sexual abuse at Clifford’s hands when she was 15, which ended only after the traumatised youngster threatened to commit suicide.

She wrote: ‘I wondered if you remembered, as I do, the child sexual abuse you engaged in? You took pleasure in degrading me...abusing me... and returning me to my home with a story so my parents didn’t become suspicious... so they would be fooled their daughter was in safe hands and not those of a paedophile.

‘You made my life a living hell. I had no one to turn to. You were very clever. An A+ in grooming children. How proud you must be.’ On seeing the letter, Miss Westwood urged Clifford to go to the police, but instead he kept the letter by his bed like a trophy.

Upset: In her first interview she said that Clifford had a bin liner of pornography he was 'proud' of and also bragged: ‘I just used to be able to get women to do whatever I wanted.’

She recalled: ‘He came home from work one day and said that he’d received this letter. He showed me the letter and I was horrified. I said, “Well, I think you should go to the police”, and he said, “No I’m not going to the police”.

‘I said, “What are you going to do?”, and he said, “Tear it up and put it in the bin where it belongs”.

‘I thought that’s what he’d done with it and then a little while later when I was going through the drawers I found the letter and I felt so uncomfortable about it I took a copy, because at that time I was going to leave him anyway, and this was just more evidence of some of the things I was having to put up with.

‘I just feel desperately sorry for this person.’ 

After Clifford’s case passed through Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London, Miss Westwood refused to attend his trial at Southwark Crown Court in May.

She said: ‘I had thought seriously about going because I knew it would be better for him if I was there.

‘I just thought he’s just showing me no respect at all, and in the end I just thought I can see what you’re gaining from this, but actually I’m not gaining anything, other than trying to be a kind person and standing by you.

‘I was in a terrible state. I wasn’t eating, I wasn’t sleeping. It was a horrid time.

‘My mind was all over the place. One day I would think he’s going to walk away, he’s going to get off with this, another time I was thinking the evidence is so strong he can’t possibly. So I was very mixed up.’

Clifford was jailed in May on eight counts of indecent assault between 1977 and 1984 in which he used his celebrity connections to lure women

Clifford was jailed in May on eight counts of indecent assault between 1977 and 1984 in which he used his celebrity connections to lure women.

His ex-wife said she was shocked by the sentence, which was upheld by appeal judges last week, adding: ‘It was a shock. But I expected him to call me because I think he knew I would be left in this media circus, but he didn’t and that was hard.’

Weeks later, a court granted her a divorce in just 105 seconds for his ‘unreasonable behaviour’, which has caused her stress and heart problems.
