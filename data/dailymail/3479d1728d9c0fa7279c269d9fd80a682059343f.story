Lee Selby has fond memories of sparring Joel Brunker - now he's determined to give the Australian a night to forget.

Victory for the Welsh featherweight at the O2 on Saturday will set him up for a shot at IBF world champion Evgeny Gradovich.

But standing in his way is the dangerous and undefeated 28 year old from New South Wales.

'This is the one to see if I really am a good fighter or I'm over-hyped like some people have been saying,' said Selby. 

'I believe that on my day I can beat anyone. If I can take my best into the ring, I don't think there's a featherweight out there that can live with me. 

'I am not saying that based on my last performances, but in sparring and in the gym I believe that if I can replicate that I will prove it, and I need to deliver that.

'I believe I can become the best featherweight on the planet – and if you don't believe me, I'll open the gym up and let people come down to the gym and watch me spar.

'Joel is a tough customer, he has power in both hands and is the real deal so this is the time for me to prove I can get to the top and stay there.

'I have made my hard fights look easy recently, if I had stood and had a fight with them I might have made them look good but I boxed on the back foot, used my skills, and got easy wins. That's maybe why I am not getting the credit that I should be getting.'

Selby outpointed Romulo Koasicha in Cardiff in May to set him up for his biggest fight to date

Selby and Brunker met in sparring in Las Vegas two years ago and the 27 year old hinted that fans can expect fireworks this weekend.

'We sparred a couple of years ago when he was 23-0, it was the first time I went to America, so he's only had four fights since,' added Selby. 

'We sparred at Mayweather's gym a couple of times and it was competitive and then we sparred again in Eddie Mustapha's H.I.T Factory gym a couple of times. 

'We didn't talk about fighting really, I was Commonwealth champion at the time and he's Australian so I had thought about it but not too much and neither had he, and we certainly didn't think we'd be meeting in a final eliminator for a world title. 

'If the sparring is anything to go by, the fans are in for a treat.'
