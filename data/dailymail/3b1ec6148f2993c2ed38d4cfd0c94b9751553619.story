Multi-millionaire Premier League stars are more often than not dismissed as mercenaries who are happy to wear the colours of whichever club is offering the biggest pay cheque or winning the most trophies.

But in a stunt aimed at inspiring Chelsea supporters, kit makers Adidas want to show fans that the club's galaxy of stars really are true blue.

The ‘It’s Blue, What Else Matters’ campaign sees players covered in blue liquid in a bid to get fans of the Stamford Bridge club to buy the new kit before they even see it.

The film and accompanying images, which feature some of the reigning European Champions' top stars including captain John Terry, Belgian midfielder Eden Hazard and striker Fernando Torres, are meant to show the lengths that the players will go to for their club.  

It is based on the idea that the club is not just a team but something much more emotive than that.

An Adidas spokesman said: 'The campaign was created based on the insight that Chelsea can clearly own blue as a colour.

'Not only do they sing about it, but they are the only club in the English Premier League that call themselves The Blues.

'Seeing the players take part and show their commitment to the colour and the lengths that they will go to will inspire the fans and show the club as they have never been seen before.'

The 90 second film that has been created for the campaign features Juan Mata, David Luiz, Gary Cahill and club captain John Terry among other big name stars.

It starts with the journey of a single drop of blue liquid dominating the screen before cutting to a locker bleeding Adidas’ iconic three stripes of blue liquid from its vent. 

Terry’s feet are then seen being covered in blue as a suspended barrel of the blue starts to slowly pour creating a wall of paint.

The clip then cuts back to John Terry, Juan Mata and Gary Cahill, who are all bare chested, sizing up the blue liquid in front of them.

Skipper Terry is then pictured falling back into a pool of the blue liquid, a scene that had to be shot in one take, and the locker that was bleeding the three stripes suddenly explodes over Juan Mata, who does not flinch such is his commitment to being blue.

Dramatic: David Luiz, left, bursts out of a vat of blue at the end of the clip while Eden Hazard is also pictured in action covered in blue

On display: The pictures from the advertising campaign will be placed around Stamford Bridge in time for Sunday's visit of Sunderland

Defender Gary Cahill walks through the wall of paint in a dramatic scene before the climax of the film shows David Luiz as he bursts out of a vat of blue which he was submerged in.

The players who took part spent more than two hours on set to create the campaign.

And while being doused in blue paint is a bit of a contrast to the normal daily training routine, the shoot was a welcome change for the players involved.

Brazilian defender David Luiz said: 'I have really enjoyed being part of this day, I would do anything for this club and to show my passion for being a Blue means everything to me.'

Goalkeeper Petr Cech, who has been at the club for nine years, added: ‘I can say that being painted in blueshows how blue I can be.

'Chelsea is a huge part of my life and Chelsea Football Club has become like my second family.'

The campaign has been launched this evening and images of the players painted blue will be on show at Stamford Bridge on Sunday as Chelsea take on Sunderland.

Adidas say that the kit itself will be revealed over the coming weeks.
