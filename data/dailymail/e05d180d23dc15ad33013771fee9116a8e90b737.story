My initial impression is that this 33-man squad errs slightly on the defensive, cautious side. It is nonetheless full of high-quality players who are well capable of enjoying a big November.

England need to win at least three, ideally four, of their games against New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia next month, with Australia the most important by far as we face them in the World Cup.

As much as we heap praise on the Southern Hemisphere nations, already this England side will be nobody’s opposition of choice in a World Cup match. Teams would much rather face Ireland, Wales or France.

Chris Robshaw is the right man to captain England but might be better used on the other side of the scrum

Wasps captain James Haskell would be best deployed at No 8, rather than at flanker

Team A is the side I’d pick to play New Zealand from Stuart Lancaster’s squad. Team B is my line-up — excluding injuries – if I had picked the squad. Team C assumes everyone is fit.

(Personnel and positional changes are in CAPITALS)

Team A: Promising

Mike Brown, Semesa Rokoduguni, Luther Burrell, Owen Farrell, Marland Yarde, George Ford, Danny Care, Joe Marler, Dylan Hartley, David Wilson, Joe Launchbury, Courtney Lawes, Tom Wood, Chris Robshaw (captain), James Haskell

Team B: Exciting

Mike Brown, Semesa Rokoduguni, Luther Burrell, Owen Farrell, CHRISTIAN WADE, DANNY CIPRIANI, Danny Care, Joe Marler, Dylan Hartley, David Wilson, Joe Launchbury, Courtney Lawes, CHRIS ROBSHAW (c), STEFFON ARMITAGE, James Haskell

TEAM C: Off the scale

(85,000 fans would be off their seats if this team clicked)

Mike Brown, Semesa Rokoduguni, MANU TUILAGI, Owen Farrell, CHRISTIAN WADE, DANNY CIPRIANI, Danny Care, ALEX CORBISIERO, Dylan Hartley, DAN COLE, Joe Launchbury, Courtney Lawes, CHRIS ROBSHAW (c), STEFFON ARMITAGE, James Haskell.

With 12 Tests to go before England’s opening World Cup game against Fiji, there is still huge scope for fine-tuning in the camp.

As I wrote earlier this week, a coach needs to wake up feeling excited and confident about the team he is putting out for a big match. Using that as my guide, I have selected three England XVs to demonstrate how I feel the team could and should develop in the next year or so. A successful autumn will send our Springbok, Kiwi and Wallaby friends home with a lot to think about, and leave us entering World Cup year with momentum. Momentum is everything in World Cup year.

Team A (in the first green box, above) is the England team I would pick to play New Zealand on November 8 from the squad Stuart Lancaster named on Wednesday. Team B is the England side I would pick and includes three players not in the 33-man squad. I consider Steffon Armitage available! Team C takes into account those currently on the injured list and assumes they are fully fit. If I was an opposition coach, Team C would keep me awake at night. You could coach Team C to play an irresistible style of attacking rugby. 

Christian Wade should have been selected to add some magic on the wing for England

Steffon Armitage should also be included in spite of the fact he plays his club rugby in France

Danny Cipriani should be selected at No 10 with Owen Farrell playing outside him in the centres

November 8 vs New Zealand

November 15 v South Africa

November 22 v Samoa

November 29 v Australia

Team A features most of the best we saw in New Zealand with the addition of Semesa Rokoduguni, who is stepping up to the plate at Bath. I’d have George Ford at fly-half for his attacking skills while the pack is already a mighty unit. I would want both Chris Robshaw and James Haskell in my team so Haskell would play No 8. 

In Team B, I’d make four changes, three in personnel and one positional – all designed to up the attacking threat. I’d make a straight swap at fly-half and bring in Danny Cipriani for Ford. Attack is the big strength of both players and there is no question we needed to see Cipriani start against one of the big teams, to observe him under pressure but also to give him the chance to play behind that very strong go-forward England pack.

I would also bring in that magician of a wing Christian Wade for the match-winning moments of brilliance he can conjure from nowhere. Don’t deny yourself his firepower because of any perceived defensive weakness. In the pack I would tinker with the back row. I want to see Armitage at openside in a match that matters but I love what captain Robshaw brings to the team, so I would ask him to play blindside.

Finally Team C is my team that would give us the absolute best chance of winning the World Cup on home soil. I’d bring in a fit and injury-free Manu Tuilagi at outside centre, keeping the all-round skills and world-class goal-kicking of Farrell at 12. The passing, running and left foot/right foot kicking options of Cipriani and Farrell would give England the attacking options you need at the very highest level. In the pack, if fully fit, Alex Corbisiero and Dan Cole are as good as any props in the world and would complete a truly formidable England line-up.

England will kick off their series against the All Blacks, who are captained by flanker Richie McCaw

Lancaster's side also face World Cup pool rivals Australia, who often turn to Israel Folau for inspiration

South Africa will also travel to Twickenham, with lock Eben Etzebeth hoping to make his presence felt
