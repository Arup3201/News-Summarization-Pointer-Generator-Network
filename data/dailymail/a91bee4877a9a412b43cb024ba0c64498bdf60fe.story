Kevin Howlett, 40, admitted a breach of the Computer Misuse Act at Peterlee Magistrates Court

A married man sent naked 'revenge porn' photos of his mistress to all her friends and family after he discovered she was cheating on him, a court heard.

Kevin Howlett learned that his lover had been unfaithful from his own wife after he confessed to the  affair.

The betrayed 40-year-old then went through the mobile phone he had loaned to his mistress and sent naked images to her to friends, family and work colleagues.

The father-of-two was hauled before magistrates accused of hacking her contacts list and admitted a breach of the Computer Misuse Act.

The victim had moved to Darlington, County Durham, from her home in Nottingham after meeting Howlett on Facebook.

Peterlee Magistrates Court in Durham heard that she initially lived in a shared house before moving in with her lover and his family.

During the affair the victim allowed Howlett to take naked pictures of her. 

Things turned sour between the pair when Howlett told his wife that he had been having an affair with the woman.

It was during the confession that his wife revealed that the victim had been having a series of affairs behind his back.

 'Following an incident the relationship between them ended and she packed her belongings, jumped on bus and returned home,' said Paula Sanderson, prosecuting.

'She thought she wouldn't put it past the defendant to send photographs that displayed her naked to her family and friends - and that is effectively what has happened.

'She said that she felt mortified that they, as well as work colleagues, had seen the photographs of her.'

Clive Booth, defending, told the court it was an 'unusual offence with a strange background.'

He said: 'He felt he had been betrayed and in order to get his revenge he went into the phone and he found her contacts (on a SIM card the victim had left in the phone).

'I don't believe there is anything prohibiting someone sending naked photos on their own phone.

Kevin Howlett, 40, is set to return to Peterlee Magistrates Court, pictured above, for sentence next month 

'The reason the defendant was advised to plead guilty was that, on the phone he had lent her and which she had given back to him, he went into her phone contacts without her authority.

'By doing so, in my view, he breached the section in the Computer Misuse Act.'

Mr Booth added that Howlett was 'very ashamed' of his actions.

Howlett of Darlington, Durham, pleaded guilty to breaching the Computer Misuse Act.

The case was adjourned until February 18 for sentencing.
