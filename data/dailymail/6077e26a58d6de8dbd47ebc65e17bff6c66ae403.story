Snapping her fingers and swinging her arms as she walked down the fairway, Lucy Li completed a runaway victory in the sectional qualifier for the US Women’s Open at Half Moon Bay in her native California on Monday.

Bearing in mind 1,622 women representing 46 American states and 51 other countries entered this tortuous qualifying process for the chance to play at Pinehurst next month, to win her own particular 36-hole marathon by seven shots was some achievement.

But here’s the extraordinary thing: Li is aged just 11.

History: Eleven-year-old Li has become the youngest player to qualify for the US Women's Open

Watching brief: Li impressed at the Drive, Chip and Putt Championships at August in April

And so if it wasn’t enough that she 
got to putt on the 18th green at Augusta National in April as the 
runaway winner in her age division in the club’s first Drive, Chip and 
Putt Championship for juniors — heck, what chance did anyone else stand?
 — now she gets to play in a full-blown major, as the youngest-ever 
qualifier.

Li got into golf
 only four years ago, and then it was by chance. She was bored waiting 
for her brother and cousin, who were playing in a tournament, so she hit
 a few balls on the driving range.

It
 wasn’t long before she became a student at the Jim McLean golf school 
in Florida. Five months after picking up her first club, she was 
finishing third in her first tournament.

No
 category has been helped by technology quite as much as young females. 
The clubs are so light these days they are compensating for a natural 
lack of strength, and it allows someone like Li to cultivate a 
fabulous-looking golf swing with sumptuous balance and grace even at her
 tender age.

Last Sunday, 
the amazing New Zealander Lydia Ko, just 17 and the world No 3 already, 
had the chance to reach the summit before fading a little on the last 
day of the Kingsmill Championship in Virginia. It’s only a matter of 
time, of course, before she reaches the top. She might even do it before
 her 18th birthday.

The 
youngest females to play in the US Women’s Open before Li were Americans
 Morgan Pressel and Lexi Thompson, who were 12. The obvious danger is 
that such bright lights will be extinguished by the time their teenage 
years are over, but Pressel, 25, and Thompson, 19, have both avoided  
burn-out to become major champions in their own right.

Indeed, on the day Li was winning at Augusta, Thompson was putting the finishing touches to her maiden major triumph.

Working
 with noted coach McLean has allowed Li to meet some of the world’s best
 already, including Phil Mickelson, Justin Rose and Thompson.  It’s the 
mop-haired Ulsterman who’s her idol, however.

‘Rory
 is so nice, isn’ t he?’ she coos. To think, it wasn’t that long ago 
that Rory McIlroy was the fresh-faced kid looking up at his heroes. Now,
 at the ripe age of 25, the generation he’s inspiring are already making
 waves.

So many, like Ko, Li
 and Michelle Wie, have Asian heritage. Indeed, the greatest boon in the
 history of golf was not inspired by Tiger Woods winning the Masters 
aged 21 but the Korean Se Ri Pak winning the US Women’s Open in 1998.

It
 provoked phenomenal interest in the Far East, which manifests itself 
today in the great number of talented Asian golfers who are  making such
 an impression on the world game. The greatest performance by a girl was
 still probably Wie getting within a shot of making the halfway cut in a
 men’s PGA Tour event at the age of just 14, the 2004 Sony Open in her 
native Hawaii. She beat Adam Scott, among  others, that day, and look 
where he is now.

But earning
 your place in the field for the biggest event in women’s golf by seven 
shots at the age of 11 is startlingly impressive.

Come out swinging: The 11-year-old will become the youngest-ever participant at a US Women's Open

Asked
 to name her favourite moment in golf history, Li provoked another sharp
 intake of breath in going for Francis Ouimet’s win in the 1913 US Open.
 Tell me: is there another 11-year-old who’s even heard of Ouimet? She 
probably pronounced his name properly as well.

So
 to storied Pinehurst and a women’s Open that was already historic for 
the fact it would be the first to be held back to back with the men’s US
 Open on the same course, albeit a version several hundred yards 
shorter.  Now here comes Li, snapping her fingers and swinging her arms.

It is just one of the many reasons why she stands out in the crowd.

Michelle Wie: At just 11, she won both the Hawaii State Women's Stroke Play Championship - became the youngest player ever to qualify for an LPGA event, and the youngest (13) to ever make the cut at a US Women's Open.

Lexi Thompson: Previously the youngest ever (12) to qualify for the US Women's Open. Now 19, she won the Kraft Nabisco Championship this year.

Guan Tianlang: Made the cut at last year's Masters at the age of 14.
