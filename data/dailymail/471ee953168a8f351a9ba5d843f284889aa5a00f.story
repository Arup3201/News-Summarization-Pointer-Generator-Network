Authorities have reportedly stopped almost a dozen terror suspects in airports during the past month in a huge national security operation.

Seven people of interest were detained at Sydney Airport, and a further four at Melbourne Airport between August 15 and September 1.

Some suspects were discovered to have in their possession images of beheadings, while others were carrying Islamist propaganda, according to the Herald Sun.

Electronic devices with offensive images as well as tens of thousands of dollars worth of undeclared cash were flagged with authorities as part of an effort to curb 'home-grown terrorists'.

The terror suspects were intercepted by Customs and Border Protection, the Australian Federal Police or the new Counter-Terrorism Units.

Customs and Border Protection told the publication they were giving their officers more power to move towards 'security as a priority' which meant some people may be held up at airports.

'On occasion, flights will be held, people and baggage will have to be unloaded ... but this is important for our national security,' a spokesman said.

The CTU was formed in late August after Australian Khaled Sharrouf flew out of Sydney Airport  on his brother’s passport in December to fight for Islamic State in Syria.

Sharrouf became known for taking photographs of his seven-year-old son holding a severed head in Syria.

A further six people missed their flights after being stopped to be searched by authorities between August 9 and September 1.
