At 21st 9lbs, Sam Akerman always felt as though strangers were judging her and that she was second best compared to slimmer women.

The civil servant, 29, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, also found herself the butt of jokes about her size.

On a night out before starting her fitness regime, dropping 6st 9lb to 15st in two years, Sam reveals she was made a laughing stock by a man who was ‘on a mission to pull as many fatties as he could’.

She said: ‘I was part of a hockey team sports tour.

‘We were on a night out and I was approached by this guy who it turns out was on a mission to pull as many fatties as he could and he then took pictures as evidence.’

Weighing in at her heaviest at 21st 9lb meant that Sam stood out, but this was ‘really horrible, I just wanted to be treated the same as everyone else’, she said.

‘Other people noticed the humiliation. I just laughed it off and my friends were laughing it off because that is how I was dealing with it but I just wanted the ground to swallow me up.

‘It was a joke but it made me a joke. I was just on a night out with the girls.’

Sam is now two years into her health, fitness and weight loss programme which involves regular trips to the gym with a friend for support and work with Slimming World.

However, she says that being shamed on her night out with the girls did not help her to rethink her life - it was only wanting to be healthier that made her do that.

‘The thing is, food was my security blanket,’ she said.

‘I loved cooking and it is my comfort zone. If friends are going out you just want to feel part of it and to feel normal.

‘If that situation happened again now I know I could deal with it with my head held high.’

She has noticed a greater self-confidence since losing weight and does not tell people about her dramatic change in size unless they ‘react positively to me in the first place’.

She said: ‘Before, I had no control over how I looked or how people were treating me, but now I have lost the weight I have found the confidence from somewhere.’

Sam said it helps that people have contacted her to say they are inspired to try to be healthier and lose weight after seeing how successful she has been.

She said: ‘When I was overweight and went out I always felt judged and always felt like I was second best, say when I was queuing for a drink at a bar.

‘I feel more confident now. I have still got a long way to go on this journey, but it is a start.’
