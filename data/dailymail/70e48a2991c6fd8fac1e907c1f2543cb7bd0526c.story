The congested route from England’s World Cup base in Rio de Janeiro to their training ground is causing FA chiefs a ‘nightmare’.

When The Mail on Sunday hired a coach last week to test the journey, it took a distinctly uncomfortable hour and 15 minutes.

And despite a promise from the mayor of Rio to help with police outriders, there are growing fears they will make little difference. In fact, it could get a whole lot worse.

The England squad arrive today, and from tomorrow more than 600,000 fans from across the globe will converge on Brazil, significantly increasing traffic volume in major cities.

Civil unrest and strikes will only add to the congestion. On Friday, the country’s biggest city, Sao Paulo, was paralysed by striking Metro workers.

Over the past year there have been violent disturbances by demonstrators angry at the spiralling cost of the World Cup, and reports suggest demonstrators plan to cause chaos with sit-down protests on major roads.

The Mail on Sunday tested the traffic in Rio on the route the England team will take from their hotel, Royal Tulip, to their training ground Sao Joao Fort in Rio de Janeiro during this summer's World Cup

‘There are concerns fans will miss flights and games,’ said a transport source. ‘And it could directly affect England and other teams. It is bad enough for England as it is.’

England are based at the Royal Tulip hotel in the Sao Conrado suburb of Rio with their training ground eight miles away at the Sao Joao Fort, which is within a Brazilian army base.

Manaus –  the steamy, mosquito-infested city in the middle of the Amazon jungle where England kick off their World Cup campaign against Italy next Saturday – has a surprising footnote in the annals of English football.

It was in this remote outpost that Manaós Athletic a team of Englishmen working in the Amazon, clinched the Amazonas Football Championship 100 years ago.

‘Manaós proved that Englishmen could play, and conquer, in the Amazon,’ said historian Neto Viera. ‘It’s a good omen for Rooney and co.'

David Beckham has revealed his ego and desire for glory on the pitch got in the way of being a good father and husband

David Beckham has revealed his ego and desire for glory on the pitch got in the way of being a good father and husband.

The former England captain says on the BBC1 documentary David Beckham Into the Unknown, to be broadcast tomorrow: ‘Playing for AC Milan was a difficult time for Victoria.

'The boys would visit me from Los Angeles, and there was one moment when they were leaving and they were holding on to me and that, as a father, was one of my toughest moments.

'It was selfish because I wanted to make the 2010 World Cup team. I would have done anything to play in it.’

Bookmakers Paddy Power were accused of being behind a mischievous PR stunt in the Brazilian rainforest last night after an aerial picture appeared on the internet with the words ‘C’mon England PP’ apparently carved out of the jungle.

Although it was unclear who was behind the image and whether it was genuine, people took to Twitter to accuse the betting firm of causing an ecological catastrophe.
