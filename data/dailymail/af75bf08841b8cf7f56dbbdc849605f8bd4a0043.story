A Florida teenager had his right arm ripped to shreds after a terrifying encounter with a barracuda that jumped out of the water while he was fishing with his dad on Sunday.

Parker King, 13, nearly bled to death after the attack which happened 20 miles offshore from Port Orange and led to a frantic race by his father, Irwin, to get back to shore in time.

The drama began when the father and son team spotted the large barracuda and decided to try and catch the notoriously volatile fish.

'We seen him and he was big and we were like, 'This should be a fun little fight.'  But it wasn't.  It wasn't,' said Irwin King.

The barracuda, an aggressive species of fish which can grow up to seven-feet in length and boasts razor sharp teeth, was snared by the father-son fishing team.

'In a split second, he went from there, up over the boat and just nailed him right on the upper chest/' King told Local 6.

The wounds Parker suffered were extensive and he began bleeding fast, all over his father's small fishing boat.

The real dilemma was due to their distance from the shore.

At over 20 miles out there was no phone reception and no way to call a helicopter to come and fetch them.

So, Irwin King just turned back toward shore and went to full speed.

'It's still flopping in the back of the boat and I started going, just heading, I mean, it was not a fun ride.  It was a bouncy ride and I really didn't care. I didn't care if parts were flying off the boat, I just wanted to get him in,' recalled King.

With only a spare towel wrapped around his wounds to stem the bleeding, Parker's life was in the balance.

'I was praying that he wasn't going to run out of blood,' said King.

Parker is now recovering in hospital and according to his dad, has a new found respect for the fish he is trying to catch.

'The fish won on that one.  He got us, he got Parker. He was a champ, I mean, he was a champ,' said Irwin King.
