An Alaskan man is extremely lucky to be alive after being forced to spend three days in the wilderness battling not only sub-zero temperatures but also the advances of a hungry wolverine.

Craig Johnson from Barrow was halfway through an 80-mile trek through remote Alaska to visit family for the holidays in Wainwright when his snowmobile fell through the ice on December 15.

As his snowmobile sank, Johnson, 38, was submerged in freezing water up to his chest before he managed to crawl back to a thicker part of the ice.

Johnson sought refuge from the subzero conditions and the wolverine by climbing inside this wooden box

'I almost gave up... But I couldn't give up. I had to do it for my boys, my family,' he told ABC News. 'I think it's a miracle that I'm alive.'

In his frozen clothes and enduring subzero temperatures with a windchill estimated at 35 below zero, Johnson walked 30 miles searching for help before a wolverine started to stalk him.

'You could hear it on the ice, just playing with me, toying with me,' he said.

After failing to shoot the animal and then running out of bullets, Johnson was forced to use a stick to defend himself. 

Fortunately Johnson stumbled upon a wooden box that he was able to use as shelter.

Unfortunately the down side of being stuck in the box was that it made it even more difficult for several rescue helicopters that flew past to try and find him.

'That third night when they passed right by me - not even 200, 300 yards - that's when I lost hope,' Johnson said. 'I just laid back down in that box I was in. It just felt like that was an open grave for me.'

With temperatures of -35 degrees, a search team led by Johnson's cousin desperately hunted for him.

The wind and snow had erased almost all signs of Johnson and was only rescued when his cousin heard his desperate screams. 

'I've never heard someone yell like that anywhere,' said Benson.

'If Clifford didn't saw me, that was going to be my last night,' said Johnson. They were going to bring me home in a body bag.'

Johnson, who suffered severe frostbite, hypothermia, dehydration and internal injuries from the snowmobile crash, is currently recovering at an Anchorage hospital.

He said his will to survive was partly fueled by his father's death in 1998 when he had fallen through the ice and drowned.
