Failing to see the funny side: Jimmy Carr had to slope off stage early after being heckled about his tax avoidance at a charity gig in London last night

Jimmy Carr was forced to cut short his stand-up routine at a charity event after being mercilessly heckled over tax avoidance.

The 40-year-old was headline act but while comedians further down the bill at the Hackney Empire in east London got a warm welcome, Carr was greeted by a heckler shouting ‘pay your taxes’ as soon as he took to the stage.

He announced that he would tell 50 jokes but soon faced further tax-related taunts and other heckles including ‘you’re not one of us’ and ‘you’re not wanted here’.

He ended up abandoning much of his intended act – and sang a Neil Diamond hit instead.

Carr was criticised by the Prime Minister last year when his use of a controversial Jersey-based tax scheme was revealed.

He subsequently joked that he knew he was in trouble ‘when Cameron broke off a meeting with Obama [US President] to say “Jimmy Carr is a d***”.’

Carr used Twitter to apologise for sheltering millions of pounds from tax using an avoidance scheme called K2.

He admitted at the time that he had made a ‘terrible error of judgment’ but had left the scheme and would ‘in future conduct my financial affairs more responsibly’.

At Thursday’s launch of Arts Emergency, a charity to defend education in the arts and provide mentoring for underprivileged students, Carr said he thought it would be nice to do a gig for a ‘great cause’.

As the heckling continued, he asked for audience members who did not like his act to allow others to enjoy it but he got no respite. A male member of the crowd said Carr used to be funny around a decade ago, leading Carr to brand him ‘a hipster who only likes the early stuff’.

Eventually Carr was given advice from off-stage that he did not have much time left despite having told only a fraction of the 50 jokes he had on a clipboard.

The star said he would tell one more to try to leave on a good note but as he looked through his list, an audience member demanded ‘sing us a song’.

Carr finally found himself in tune with the crowd as he launched into Sweet Caroline by Neil Diamond and had many of them singing along with him.
