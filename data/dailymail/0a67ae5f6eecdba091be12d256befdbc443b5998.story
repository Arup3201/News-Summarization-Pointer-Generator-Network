Celebrations to mark the 70th anniversary of D-Day will cost lives among the hundreds of former British servicemen returning to France, a Normandy veteran has warned.

He fears lives will be lost because serious health concerns for the 900 ex-troops, some aged 96, are being ignored in favour of the world’s politicians.

Jack Woods, 90, secretary of the Norfolk branch of the Normandy Veterans’ Association, said: ‘There will definitely be casualties because the anniversary programme is too big for us old boys.

‘On Sword Beach we’ll be surrounded by 2,000 VIPs and heads of state and at least 15,000 members of the public. There will also be a huge security operation.

‘I’ve got veterans who are in wheelchairs, very frail and likely to be shocked  by everything happening around them. It would be a great shame, especially for their families, were they to come to any harm. I fear the worst because this anniversary has been taken over by the politicians – it is their show, not ours.

‘In previous years the ceremonies have been quieter and more manageable, and we were younger then, but 2014 is very different.’

George Batts, national secretary of the NVA, admitted there would be ‘problems’ at the event, on June 5 and 6, but said: ‘I hope there won’t be any who fall ill.’
