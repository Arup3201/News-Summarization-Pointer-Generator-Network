A great white shark was pictured creeping up on a pair of surfers in Manhattan Beach, California recently.

A local mother, who asked not to be identified, was taking a picture of her 12-year-old son and a friend just as they were about to catch a wave when the shark appeared in the break.

'It was quite a shock to see,' the mother told KTLA.

'Many local surfers and lifeguards have seen this and believe it to be a shark,' she added. 'Of course, I told my kids it was a dolphin, as we live at the beach and are in the waters here almost daily.'

Lately, more and more juvenile great white sharks have been spotted in the area.

Local Jay Dohner paddle boarded the waters off Manhattan Beach earlier this month equipped with his video camera when he heard about the great whites and captured not one but three great whites in the water.

'The sharks didn't seem to be paying me any attention,' he told the Los Angeles Times. 'They looked like they were looking for fish, so I felt I could stand there safely and watch them.'

Local authorities say the sharks post no threat to swimmers.

Seeing the sharks closer to shore has actually been heralded as a victory by marine biologists.

They're saying its evidence that a law prohibiting the use of gill nets for fishing passed in 1990 is leading to a healthy rebound of wildlife in the ocean.

For now, the white sharks are under special protection by the state during a review period on whether to list them as a threatened or an endangered species.
