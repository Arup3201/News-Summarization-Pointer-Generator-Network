It was a family day out for Zara Phillips today as she joined her mother Princess Anne and father Mark Phillips at an equestrian event.

But she didn't have to travel far, for the Festival of British Eventing is held at the Princess Royal's Gatcombe Park estate - where Zara also lives.

As a result, all three looked relaxed and happy, with Captain Phillips throwing a protective arm around his daughter, while Princess Anne cracked a joke before rubbing her nose.

Looking good: Zara opted for a simple white shirt and a pair of indigo skinny jeans for the event

Zara, who was pretty in indigo skinny jeans, a cream shirt and a pair of tan loafers, is currently in training for the World Equestrian Games in Normandy later this month but took a break to spend time with her parents and sister-in-law Autumn Phillips.

She also allowed herself a rare day off yesterday, when she joined racing fans for Ladies Day at Glorious Goodwood yesterday.

There, she joined Charles Gordon-Lennox, Earl of March and Kinrara and his wife, Janet, in their box, where she was later seen chatting animatedly to unlikely racing fan, Tom Cruise.

Although an unexpected guest, the actor, 52, appeared to quickly get the hang of racing and looked positively delighted when he was serenaded with the Mission Impossible theme tune by the Band of the Yorkshire Regiment.

Today's outing was an altogether more low-key affair but offered her the rare chance to spend time with both parents, particularly as Captain Phillips, who is currently Chef d'Equipe for the US eventing team, is spending a considerable amount of time on the other side of the Atlantic.

His time there hasn't been without scandal, however, after he left his second wife Sandy for an American showjumper 30 years his junior.

Captain Phillips' relationship with Lauren Hough, 37, is still thought to be going strong two years after it was revealed, and appears to have had little impact on his career.

Like his first wife Princess Anne and daughter Zara, he has enjoyed enormous success in the world of equestrianism, beginning with his gold medal winning appearance at the Munich Olympics in 1972.

As well as Olympics success, Captain Phillips won the Badminton Horse Trials in 1971 and 1972 riding Great Ovation, in 1974 on Colombus, and in 1981 on Lincoln.

After he retired from the Army, he continued to style himself Captain Mark Phillips - which was allowed as junior cavalry officers whose civilian work involves equestrianism may continue to use their rank.

While Zara is yet to win Olympic gold, she will be hoping for a good performance in Normandy later this month, with Team GB selectors for Rio 2012 expected to be in the crowd.

She will, at least, have the support of her London 2012 teammates William Fox-Pitt, Tina Cook, Nicola Wilson and Mary King, who are also expected to compete in France.
