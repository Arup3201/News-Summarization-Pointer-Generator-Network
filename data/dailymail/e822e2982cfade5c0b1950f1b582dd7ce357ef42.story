When Josh and Robbyn Blick learned that their son would be born with a fatal genetic abnormality, they were excited about the days they would get to spend with him - even if there weren't many.

So when little Zion Isaiah was born on January 11 - weighing just 4 pounds and 7 ounces - they were [overjoyed] to welcome him - and overjoyed when he fought to live for ten days.

The couple, along with their four other young sons, documented the ten precious days they got to spend with baby Zion at their home in Lake Zurich, Illinois before he passed away on January 21.

Through beautiful photos posted to Instagram and a Vimeo video, they shared tender moments from his birth in hospital through to his one-week birthday celebration, surrounded by his brothers.

Miracle baby: Zion Isaiah Blick was born with a genetic disease that claimed his life after 10 days. But his family cherished every moment and shared images of him online - including this one when he was a day old

Welcome! Robbyn and her husband Josh smile with baby Zion after he was born on January 11

Josh, who is a pastor at the 
non-denominational Alpine Chapel in Illinois, and his wife are devout 
Christians, and they said Zion's short life taught them about God's love
 and hope after death.

'My sweet precious Zion, you are my 
gift,' Robbyn, 32, said in their video. 'Every breath you took was a moment 
to inhale the perfection of God's beauty. Every beat of your heart was a
 measure of love.

'You 
listened when you heard your daddy's voice, and you turned your eyes his
 way. I kissed your face a million times, and I wish I could give you a 
million more.'

The couple told The Blaze that the family first learned that Zion had Trisomy 18, also known as Edwards syndrome, about 20 weeks into Robbyn's pregnancy.

Proud mom: 'He's just a bit smaller than my usual 10lb babies!' the mother-of-five joked after giving birth

The genetic condition creates 
abnormalities in parts of the body, and the rate of survival is low due 
to heart abnormalities, kidney malformations and other internal organ 
disorders.

Some children with the abnormality are born with webbed feet, malformed ears, a small jaw or a small head, among other characteristics, and survival beyond the neonatal period is rare.

The Blicks discovered
 that Zion had a heart defect - but there was never any doubt that they were going to have their son.

'Our choice is always life and giving him a chance,' Robbyn told The Blaze.

She
 shared their progress online before Zion's birth - uploading pictures 
of her beaming alongside friends at her baby shower, where little signs 
read: 'We love you Zion!'

Then
 their 'miracle' happened - when Zion was born on January 11. More 
smiling pictures followed, with Robbyn cooing over his tiny size.

After
 being doted on by his parents, brothers and members of their church, 
Zion struggled with his breathing and died at just ten days old.

'I want you to know that you didn't have to be big and tall or even loud for us to notice you,' Josh said in the video. 'You didn't have to stand in front of a pulpit or write a book to capture our attention. You just did.

'In fact, you did more in your 10 days on earth than I could ever hope to. This is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. But I want you to know that I'm so proud of you.'

The family thanked Zion for everything he taught them in his short life - and how he brought them closer to God.

'He makes heaven a little closer to my heart,' they said. 'Your love for him reminds me daily now what we are living for. Thank you for sharing him with us.'

'Joy and tears': Josh shared this image of his son on day 9 - just one day before Zion's death. 'Love watching Z beat the odds,' he wrote on the photograph. 'Hate watching him struggle'
