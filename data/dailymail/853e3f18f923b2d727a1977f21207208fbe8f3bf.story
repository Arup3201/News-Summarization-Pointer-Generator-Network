The key to this series will be whether India’s seamers manage to bowl as well as their Sri Lankan counterparts did in England recently.

We all know what superb batsmen India have, but the problems they have had winning overseas Tests in the past three years have stemmed from their inability to take 20 wickets.

And that places a huge onus on the likes of Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami and Ishant Sharma.

Due a performance: Alastair Cook needs to score some runs for England against India

VIDEO Cook focused on form change

When India won in England in 2007, Zaheer Khan and RP Singh bowled beautifully. Even when they lost here 4-0 three years ago, Praveen Kumar enjoyed success by pitching the ball up. But if their frontline trio — plus Stuart Binny, if he plays — fails to fire this time, they could be in trouble. 

Looking at this England batting line-up, there is an obvious approach India can take, because so many of the batsmen like to hang back — Alastair Cook, Gary Ballance and Joe Root. Even Sam Robson, who tries to get forward, has been vulnerable to the fuller delivery.

The days when you had four different styles in Cook, Jonathan Trott, Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen are gone. Now, if you pitch the ball up in the right place — just outside off-stump — five times every over, you’ll have a chance against all of these back-foot players. 

India could do worse than take a leaf out of Sri Lanka’s book. The Sri Lankans arrived here with an unheralded seam attack of Shaminda Eranga, Dhammika Prasad and Nuwan Pradeep, but they ended up bowling better lengths than England’s seamers, even at Headingley.  

While India’s coach Duncan Fletcher may still have concerns about his bowling attack, he will not have any at all about the batsmen.

When he first took the job three years ago, he was aware of the batting talent that was coming through — and Murali Vijay, Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli are a joy to watch. 

Sometimes when you watch overseas players, you fear for their techniques in English conditions. But these guys seem to be the complete package.

And the amazing thing is that they want to keep getting better. 

Concerns: India coach Duncan Fletcher may be worried about his bowling attack for the series

Star: Virat Kohli is the new name of Indian cricket following the retirement of Sachin Tendulkar

Since the retirement of Sachin Tendulkar, Kohli has probably passed MS Dhoni as the biggest name in Indian cricket, yet he has the demeanour of a player who wants to learn as much as he can. Good isn’t good enough: he wants to be great. 

I’m not expecting him or Pujara to settle for any flashy 40s or 50s in this series: they will want to bat big. And that could hurt England.

The reality is, though, that both sides go into this series low on confidence. India have not won any of their past 14 away Tests and are not used to playing five-Test series, while England haven’t won any of their past eight — either home or away.  

You would expect England to start as favourites, but then we said that against Sri Lanka. The key for England will be for Cook to get all the individual performances we saw against the Sri Lankans to mould into a match-winning team effort. It’s up to India’s seamers to stop him.
