The original Cowardly Lion costume from The Wizard Of Oz is to go under the hammer tomorrow – and expected to make more than $1 million (£640,000).

New York auction house Bonhams say the outfit worn by actor Bert Lahr throughout the 1939 movie classic was fashioned from actual lion hides. It weighs more than four stone.

A secondary lion costume, thought to have been worn by a stuntman on the set, sold on eBay for more than £500,000 in 2006.

Under the hammer: New York auction house Bonhams say the outfit worn by actor Bert Lahr throughout the 1939 movie classic was fashioned from actual lion hides. It weighs more than four stone

Costume owner James Comisar has a trove of TV memorabilia from shows including 'I Love Lucy' and 'Lost.' He has said he plans to use money from the Cowardly Lion costume sale to exhibit his collection.

In addition to the Cowardly Lion costume, the auction will feature Wizard of Oz memorabilia such as an original script, the Witch Remover prop wielded by the Cowardly Lion in pursuit of the Wicked Witch and an assortment of memorable Emerald City costumes.  

The sale will also feature a blue gingham 'test' dress and pinafore worn by Judy Garland as Dorothy during the essential pre-production period, when costumes, hairstyles and all artistic aspects of moviemaking are refined prior to filming.

Other items announced for the auction include costumes from Gone With The Wind, North By Northwest and Rosemary's Baby.

The most iconic piano in Hollywood history – the one played by Sam in the Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman classic Casablanca – is set to go under the hammer at the auction. 

Iconic: The salmon-coloured instrument, one of two featured in the film, is the one on which the movie’s signature tune, As Time Goes By, is played by Sam (singer Dooley Wilson)

The famous upright – used in Rick’s Cafe in the 1942 film – is expected to fetch $1million – about £630,000 – as one of the highlights of a film memorabilia auction at Bonhams in New York.

The salmon-coloured instrument, one of two featured in the film, is the one on which the movie’s signature tune, As Time Goes By, is played by Sam (singer Dooley Wilson).

It is one of 30 items from the Second World War drama being put up for sale by a private collector.

The doors of Rick's Cafe America, a final draft of the screenplay, signed cast photos, and passports created for the characters in the film will all go up for auction. 

'Bonham’s is thrilled to represent this remarkable Casablanca collection, certainly one of the most significant film memorabilia collections still in private hands,' said the director of Entertainment Memorabilia at Bonham’s, Catherine Williamson, earlier this year.
