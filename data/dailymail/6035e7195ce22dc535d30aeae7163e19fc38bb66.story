When two young ladies on a day trip to a Michigan amusement park in 1915 threw their message in a bottle into the water, they probably never gave a second thought to someone finding their note generations later.

Yet just a day after it was revealed a diver from the state found the treasure 30ft down on the St. Clair River bed, present-day descendents of the girls have now been found.

Janet Baccanari received a phone call on Tuesday morning from her cousin Eric Schiebhold who had seen the story about their grandmother, Tillie Esper, who was 23-years-old on the day the note was written.

Traveled through time: Tillie Esper, one of the young ladies who wrote the message in a bottle that was found on the bed of the St.Clair river

Janet Baccanari: The granddaughter of Tillie Esper received a phone call early yesterday morning from her cousin to tell her about the note that had been recovered from almost a century ago

Ms Esper was one of the two Detroit girls who wrote a message nearly 100 years ago. She along with her friend Selina Pramstaller, who was 17 at the time, decided to commemorate their day out with their message in a bottle.

The message read - 'having a good time at Tashmoo.' The note contained the girls names and their respective addresses.

They tossed it into the St. Clair River and watched it sink as both girls enjoyed the summers day visit to Tashmoo Park on Harsens Island.

'It’s like she came back to life,' Baccanari, 46, of Beverly Hills, said. 'It’s exciting stuff.'

Mr Schiebold, 59, of Bloomfield Township said Esper had three sons and six daughters, of whom two daughters are alive and living on opposite coasts of the U.S.

There are nearly three dozen 
grandchildren across the country and he is now making it his business to
 get in touch with as many as he can find to inform them about the find.

'I
 couldn’t believe it,' he said. 'A part of me said, ‘There’s the 
old-school way of doing a text message.’ I thought it was pretty 
impressive.'

Ms Esper was born in September 1893 to Mathias and Caroline Esper, as the youngest of nine children and married Joseph J. Schaefer, a saloon-keeper, just two years after her bottle-throwing day.

She was a ladies’ hat maker but the couple found time to have nine children - the youngest of whom is still alive.

Message in a bottle: Nearly a century ago, Selina Pramstaller and Tillie Esper of Detroit wrote a simple note as they enjoyed a day at a popular amusement park on Harsens Island

Gone but not forgotten: They stuffed the message in a bottle, corked it and threw it in the waters of the St. Clair River, where it sank to the bottom where it lay for 97 years to be discovered

The bottle is expected to be donated to the historical society’s museum on the island.

'What’s
 surprising is it wasn’t yet completely silted over or dredged or an 
anchor destroyed it,' Eric Schiebold mused. 'For that to be around that 
long and found is really, really incredible.'

Neither
 Eric or Janet Baccanari, who is the 31st grandchild, recalled grandma 
Tillie talking about Tashmoo Park or leaving the message in a bottle.

Ms
 Baccanari said Tillie Esper had a 'really rich, interesting life' and 
that she 'got chills' when she read the incredible story of the bottle 
and the connection to her grandmother.

'It
 just gave me goose bumps,' she said. Tillie was apparently a lovely lady who enjoyed green tea and fish, often cooking for the family at the 
summer house in Hartland.

Her grandma would come to her childhood home every holiday and often on Sundays.

Unfortunately, Esper’s youngest child who is still alive, is unable to appreciate the historical find because she has Alzheimer’s.

Hot fun in the summertime: Tashmoo Park was an amusement park in Algonac, Michigan. Opened in 1897, it closed in 1951. The writers of the message in the bottle had spent the day here

A bygone era: Tashmoo Park offered visitors an escape from the oppressive heat and humidity of packed, sweltering Detroit in the summertime. Tashmoo Park had picnic tables, a baseball diamond, swings and rides, as well as a casino and a dancing pavilion

Since
 hearing about this special 'tale across time', several descendants have got in 
touch with Bernard Licata, President of the Harsens Island St. Clair 
Flats Historical Society.

He set himself the task of finding the families of the original writers.

The message from Tillie and Selina was written in pencil on the back of a White Star Line deposit ticket.

It even included the writers' addresses on Wabash and Maybury Grand, about nine blocks apart, in Detroit.

Thanks
 to the Internet and the Detroit Free Press, several people have been 
attempting to connect the dots and he has received more than a dozen 
phone calls and emails in just 24 hours.

Most of the information has so far been about Ms. Esper with very few leads on the whereabouts of Ms Pramstaller's decedents.

The timing couldn't be better however, because next month a special 'Tashmoo Day' event is going to be held on the island.

Tashmoo was a popular amusement park on Harsens Island, but it closed in 1951.

It was a favorite summer destination for Detroiters with a dance hall, amusement rides, bathhouse and swimming beach.

This
 summers event will celebrate days from a bygone era when the famed 
Tashmoo steamship docked daily at the park in the early 1900s, allowing 
passengers who boarded in Detroit to enjoy all that the park had to 
offer.

That message- 'having a good time at Tashmoo'- was found almost 97 years later by diver Dave Leander.

'There’s all kinds of people connecting the dots,' Licata said. 'I think it’s wonderful.'

Heyday: This female reveller was just one of the hundreds of thousands of visitors who came to Tashmoo Park before it closed in 1951

Bringing in the crowds: Steamships from Detroit and Port Huron, Michigan made frequent trips to Harsens Island

Fun in the sun: Rides (left) and swims in the river (right) were great summer activities for the visitors

Widely known: Tashmoo Park was a popular tourist attraction until it closed in 1951
