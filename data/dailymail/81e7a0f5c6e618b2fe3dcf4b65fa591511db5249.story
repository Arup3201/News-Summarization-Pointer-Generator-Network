Inadvertently betting on different horses to the ones her disabled father had picked out is probably the best mistake Amber Galligan has ever made.

A slip of the pen enabled the young mum from Newcastle to convert a £2 stake into a cool £394,487 by winning the weekly Scoop6 bet - which involved picking the winners of six televised races.

Amber, 22, had placed the bet at a BetFred shop in the city on behalf of her father Thomas, 53, who suffers from arthritis.

Unexpectant winners: Inadvertently betting on different horses to the ones her disabled dad Thomas Galligan had picked out meant he actually won nearly £395,000

However, despite widespread publicity to find the winner of the huge jackpot the pair had ruled themselves out as not all of Thomas's predictions had won.

BetFred boss Fred Done launched a nationwide appeal to find the mystery Scoop6 ticketholder before last weekend so they could take advantage of a free selection in Saturday's bonus race at Newmarket and potentially add a further £251,966 to their haul.

But Amber only discovered the slip had won after the bonus race deadline had passed when she went into the BetFred shop in Benwell to place a fresh £2 bet for her dad.

She said: 'I was at the counter when the assistant told me they'd been looking for me and I knew he wasn't joking as he was so deadly serious.

'When he first told me that the bet had won I thought it was the place part and might have been a few hundred pounds, not hundreds of thousands of pounds.

'It was weird when I heard how much it was. It hasn't sunk in really - not even now.

'I had initially written the bet out on the wrong slip for the Jackpot and the lad behind the counter put it on the Scoop6 slip for me and copied over my numbers.

She said her dad had been a fantastic father who deserved a change of luck, adding: 'My dad doesn't know how he picked Dandy Boy at 33-1 in the last leg, but it must have been a slip of the pen and I also put the number 18 in the second leg in and there were only 16 in the race, so that went on the winning favourite.'

Thomas who sleeps on the sofa at the family's two-bedroomed council flat said he now plans to splash out on a new house and take his children and grandchildren on a dream holiday.

The former builder's labourer who hails from Leith, near Edinburgh, hadn't realised that his first horse Vocational in the 2.25 at Ayr was a non-runner and that the rules of the bet automatically transferred his selection on to the winning 7-2 favourite Angels Will Fall.

He said: 'Amber is my angel - she and all my kids and grandkids mean the world to me.

'I don't bet during the week, but do the Scoop6 when I can afford it on a Saturday.

'I knew there were 568 tickets going into the last race at Royal Ascot and only one on Dandy Boy, but I never realised I was the winner as I thought I was out in leg one.

'I've not even thought about missing the bonus race, because this is so unbelievable.

'I've had years of pain and operations with arthritis in my legs and Amber and my son Michael pop down to the shop to place my Saturday bet.

'Our first priority with the win will be to buy a bigger place to live and I also want to take them all on the holiday of a lifetime. We don't really do holidays as we have just enough to get by, so I can't remember the last time we went on one if ever.'

The pair became the first substantial six figure winners not to come forward in the pool bet's 13 year history and Thomas had even shown the Scoop6 slip to a neighbour as he knew they had the final five winners on the ticket.

He had left it at their house and had to retrieve it to collect their fortune.
