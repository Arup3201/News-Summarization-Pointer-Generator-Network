It once formed an imposing, 90-mile-long concrete barrier that ran through the heart of Berlin.

But 25 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, little remains in Germany of the historic structure.

The Wall, which divided West Berlin from the communist East after it was built in 1961, was the most potent symbol of the Cold War.

It was constructed soon after Germany was divided up between the occupying powers of the US, the UK, France and the Soviet Union following the end of the Second World War.

At least 136 people were killed along the heavily guarded wall during the 28 years that it was in existence, many of them attempting to flee the East.

Since demolition of the Wall began on November 9, 1989, many sections have been auctioned off or sold as souvenirs, while large segments have been lost forever having been crushed and  used to build highways across the Germany.

However, large parts were sold as art objects and donated to museums around the world, such as the Imperial War Museum in London and Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California.

Over the last 25 years, other sections ended up in even more surprising locations, such as the Main Street Station Casino, Brewery and Hotel in Las Vegas.

The venue has installed the relic in the men's bathroom, with three urinals mounted onto the graffiti-covered concrete slab, which stands approximately three meters wide and 1.8 meters tall.

The wall itself is protected by glass, and female visitors can request to observe the monument with the aid of a security guard.

According to a book published by a German government agency earlier this year, a total of 240 segments of the wall are scattered across the globe, with more than a third of them ending up in the United States.

A row of Berlin Wall segments can be found in the lobby of the Argentinian news company Perfil Group in Buenos Aires.

The Perfil Group bought a total of 20 Berlin Wall segments in 1991, revealing that it bought the artefacts as a symbol of freedom.

The firm’s website stated that it is ‘true to the spirit of a news company who exercises the right of freedom.’

The small village of Schengen in southeast Luxembourg installed a segment of the Wall in 2010 order to celebrate its place in European history.

The Schengen Agreement, which heralded the start of a ‘borderless Europe’ was signed here in 1985 by five of the then ten member states of the European Economic Community to grant citizens free travel without border checks.

The Wall segment was erected to mark the 20th anniversary of the agreement.

Meanwhile Los Angeles is home to the longest section of Berlin Wall in the United States.

Ten segments of the historic structure currently stand in front of the Variety Building on Wilshire Boulevard.

Murals on four segments of the Wall are original works from the Berlin Wall-era, including a green bear painted by a street artist known as Bimer.

The Wende Museum in Los Angeles, a research and education institute that preserves Cold War artefacts and history, brought these segments to Wilshire Boulevard in 2009 to ‘commemorate the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and continue the legacy of the Berlin Wall as a concrete canvas for art and political expression.’

The Hilton Anatole Hotel in Dallas has installed two segments of the Wall as part of their renowned art collection.

The 3.6m-high sections were given to the hotel by a German partner in 1990 and initially placed in the hotel's garden before being moved into the hotel's Trinity Corridor in 2011.

Many sections of the Berlin Wall have been sold as souvenirs, while large segments have been lost forever having been crushed and been used to build highways across the country after the Wall’s demolition began on 9th November 1989

The longest surviving stretch of the wall is situated at the East Side Gallery in Berlin. It runs for around 1.3km

A chunk of the Berlin Wall was also placed in Vatican City in August 1994. The Wall has been decorated with a painting of St. Michael's Church.

It is understood to have been given as a gift to the Vatican in 1994 by former Ferrari motor sport director and team manager of its Formula 1 team, Marco Piccinini, who won the portion at an auction in Monte Carlo in 1990.

It was after the reunification of the East and West Germany that 65 cranes, 175 trucks and 13 bulldozers were ordered to remove the barrier in the inner city by the end of 1990.

The longest surviving stretch of the wall is situated at the East Side Gallery in Berlin. It runs for around 1.3km.
