Customers around the world who pre-ordered Samsung's Galaxy S4 handset so they could have one on the day it is released face delays of up to a week.

UK operators were today forced to send messages to customers after Samsung blamed 'unprecedented demand' for the Android handset.

US customers were also being warned of delays.

The Galaxy S4 goes on sale around the world this weekend - but Samsung has admitted it has not been able to keep up with demand, leaving customers who ordered weeks ago facing delays

Customers around the world who pre-ordered Samsung's Galaxy S4 handset so they could have one on the day it is released face delays of up to a week, the firm revealed today

The firm told MailOnline it was unable to meet demand in the UK - even though customers had ordered weeks ago.

'There has been unprecedented demand for the Galaxy S4 in
the UK,' the firm said.

'Samsung is working hard to ensure that pre-orders and sales across all
channels are fulfilled as soon as possible.'

Samsung unveiled the Galaxy S4 in a glitzy New York event in mid-March and planned the worldwide launch for 27 April.

Many thousands are believed to have pre-ordered the phone so it would arrive on launch day may now get their handset later.

The firm has undertaken a big budget 'world tour' to launch the handset.

UK operator 3 told the BBC that Samsung was 'experiencing stock constraints' and said it regretted the frustration this would cause customers.

The UK's other major operators also said they were having stock problems but were looking to prioritise customers who pre-ordered over those that walk into shops to buy the gadget.

Similar delays were being reported in the US with operator Sprint delaying the opening of its online S4 store by a week to cope with demand.

Experts expect the handset to be a smash hit.

'I believe the Samsung Galaxy S4 could be an important milestone for the Korean company, as it could be the first smartphone to outsell an iPhone,' said Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst with IDC.'The Samsung Galaxy S4 can be a game changer for Samsung, and I believe for the first time that this device has the potential to outsell the next generation of iPhone - assuming that Apple will incrementally improve the next version of the iPhone.'

The highly anticipated Samsung Galaxy S4 goes on sale in the UK tomorrow - but the firm has warned customers, even those who pre-ordered, that they may face delays because of demand

It comes as Samsung revealed strong smartphone sales have driven its income up 42 per cent to a record high despite a typically slow season for the electronics market.

The world's largest smartphone maker said its first quarter net income reached 7.2 trillion won (£4.2billion) in the first three months of 2013, compared with 5 trillion won a year earlier.

The figure was a surprising two per cent increase from the previous quarter. Analysts expected Samsung to report lower profit than the fourth quarter because demand typically slows.

But sales of Samsung's flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S III, and the oversized handset device called the Galaxy Note remained strong and shored up profit, Samsung said.

AllThingsD: 'Galaxy S 4 Is a Good, but Not a Great, Step Up'

'If
you’re a nut for lists of new features, love Samsung or crave an even 
bigger display, the Galaxy S 4 may be for you. It’s a good phone, just 
not a great one.'

T3: 'A Real Beauty' (5/5)'It
feels good, looks smart and does more than previous smartphones have. 
On the other hand, just as most people only scratch the surface of the 
capabilities of their home computers, settling for email, word 
processing and a little light gaming, there are going to be a lot of 
customers who barely dig into the features here.'The Verge: Great To Use, Unpleasant To Hold (4/5)'I
don't like holding this phone, and I can't overstate how much that 
informs the experience of using it. It makes an awful first impression, 
slippery and slimy and simply unpleasant in your hand.'

Engadget: 'Predictable Excellence'

'If you're considering a move from an older Samsung device, the GS 4 is absolutely the handset you want.'

Techcrunch: 'The S Stands For Super, Not Simple'

'It’d
be foolish to think that the Galaxy S4 isn’t a top-notch phone. But in 
playing with this phone for a while, adjusting to the new features, 
trying to make the most of them, and sometimes failing miserably, I keep
returning to the idea of 'Keep it simple, stupid.'

It also spent less on marketing its mobile devices than it did in the previous quarter when competition heated up with rivals.

Sales rose 17 per cent to 52.9 trillion won.

Operating profit was up 54 per cent to 8.8 trillion won, in line with its preliminary results released earlier this month.

Analysts expect Samsung to report another record-high profit during the April-June quarter as the Galaxy S4, the latest iteration of the Galaxy S smartphone, goes on sales worldwide, months before Apple introduces a new version of the iPhone.

Samsung said initial orders for the Galaxy S4 were higher than expected, making it difficult to meet demand. Lee Don-Joo, head of sales and marketing at Samsung's mobile division, said sales of the S4 will be higher than its predecessor.
