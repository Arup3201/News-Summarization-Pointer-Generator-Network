A judge ruled that a severely anorexic and alcoholic woman should not be force fed and kept alive after she wrote to him saying: 'I am prepared to die'.

The woman, suffering an 'unusual' combination of anorexia nervosa and alcohol dependency, wrote to Mr Justice Cobb to tell him she wanted to spend whatever time she had left 'doing nice things'.

In the moving letter, presented to the Court of Protection, she said; 'Whatever time I have left I just want to live each day alongside my granddad and (siblings), who are my world.

'I want them to know "me" rather than this illness and to have some nice memories of our time together.'

In a moving letter, presented to the Court of Protection, an anorexic and alcoholic woman has begged not to be force fed, saying: 'Whatever time I have left I just want to live each day alongside my granddad and (siblings), who are my world'

Mr Justice Cobb, who described the case as 'unusual and desperately sad', said no one involved could be identified to protect the woman's privacy. 

The woman told him that she was 'fully aware' of what was wrong with her and what the 'effects of my wish to refuse treatments' would be.

The judge, who was told that the woman's life was in 'imminent danger', ruled last month that she should not be force-fed or forced to have treatment following a hearing in the Court of Protection - where cases involving sick and vulnerable people are analysed - in London.

But detail of her letter did not emerge until today, when Mr Justice Cobb published a written analysis of the case.

The judge, who described the woman as 'young', said anorexia nervosa had dominated her life for the past 14 years.

He said a 'psychological dependence' on alcohol had caused 'end stage' irreversible liver disease.

She had been trapped in an 'increasingly destructive revolving door of treatment and recurrent illness' and had been admitted to hospital more than 45 times in 11 years - sometimes being detained under the provisions of mental health legislation.

An NHS trust had asked the judge to make rulings on what was in the woman's best interests.

Doctors said they thought it was in her best interests not to be force-fed or forced to have treatment. 

The judge reproduced the letter the woman had written to him in his ruling.

Mr Justice Cobb described the case as 'unusual and desperately sad'

'I understand the professionals concerns and the effect that this has had on all of them and I do recognise that everyone wants for the best,' the woman wrote in it.

'However I feel I have had enough of the continual pressure of mental health staff and services ... and that rather than helping me, it is actually making me worse.

'It is hard for everyone but there is a lot I can't deal with concerning therapy - it's just not something I have found able to be involved in, it's just too hard.

'But I am also fully aware that there is support and treatment still available if ever I want it.

'I am fully aware of what is wrong with my health and the effects of my wish to refuse treatments will have upon it.

'Whatever time I have left I just want to live each day alongside my granddad and (siblings), who are my world.

'I want them to know 'me' rather than this illness and to have some nice memories of our time together.

'I want to be able to look forward each day to doing 'nice' things.'

She added: 'The whole journey is mentally and emotionally horrible for everyone.

'I've got support from my nearest and dearest and that is really all the support I want now and in the future.

'I can only hope that you really hear what I am saying and what I truly hope can happen.' 

Mr Justice Cobb said evidence showed the woman had suffered a 'range of harmful childhood experiences'.

He said the woman's childhood traumas had left 'deep wounds' and manifested themselves through her 'psychological disturbance'. She had used her eating disorder and alcohol as 'props to enable her to function'.

'This is an unusual and desperately sad case,' said the judge. 'So far as I can do so, I have endeavoured to put myself in the place of (the woman) and guided by what she has directly told me and others.'

He added: 'I have reached the clear conclusion that I should not compel treatment for (her) anorexia.'
