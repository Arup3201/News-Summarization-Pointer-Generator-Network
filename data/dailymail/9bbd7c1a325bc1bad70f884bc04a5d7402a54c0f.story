A 12-month-old baby is presumed dead after a girl obsessed with TV crime shows threw him into a sewage drain to see if police could catch her.

The 14-year-old girl took Sumit Singh as he played outside his home in India last month and casually dumped him in a nearby drain. 

A female neighbour saw it happen and reported it to the police but the boy has never been found.

Sumit Singh was picked up and thrown into a sewer by a 14-year-old girl who wanted to see if the police could catch her after becoming obsessed with TV crime shows

His devastated parents Santosh and Urvashi Singh said they can only hope he is still alive one month after he was kidnapped from outside his home in Indore, Madhya Pradesh

Santosh Singh, 34, and his wife Urvashi, 29, from Indore, Madhya Pradesh, in central India, are devastated at losing their only child.

Santosh, who works at an elastic company, said: ‘Almost a month has passed since Sumit was taken. It’s been a long time, we just don't know what to think.

'But we haven’t seen his body yet so we have to remain hopeful that he’s alive.

'We have to believe he survived the fall and was swept down river. Maybe he’s being looked after somewhere.’

Sumit had been playing outside his house when his mother Urvashi turned her back for a moment and he was gone.

A neighbour spotted the teenage girl wrapping him in a cloth and then dropping him into the nearby sewage drain.

Volunteers and police searched for Suimit for four days in the sewer drain but he has not been found

Mr Singh said the family think he was swept down river and hope he is 'being looked after somewhere'

Investigating officer, Surendra Singh, said the girl denied her actions for days claiming she only threw garbage into the drain but eventually confessed to copying a TV show.

‘Initially she denied everything but after a few days she finally admitted dropping the boy,’ Officer Singh said.

‘She said she did it because she had watched a TV programme in which a woman had thrown a baby in a drain. She said she’d wanted to see if the police could catch her because the police never caught the woman in the programme.’

Officer Singh confirmed the police, the fire brigade and many divers from the local municipality had tried searching for the boy for four days but found nothing.

The National Center for Children Exposed to Violence (NCCEV) has warned that children exposed to violence and crime on TV are at a higher risk of becoming involved in the juvenile justice system.

Their report also warned ‘violence and crime can reduce self-esteem and can lead to self-destructiveness and aggressive behavior towards others’.

Police said the teenage girl is now in a juvenile centre until her trial reaches court. But she has shown no remorse and is generally aggressive.

Her family has confirmed she used to sit in front of the TV for hours watching Indian TV programmes such as Savdhaan India, a Hindi-language crime show that focuses on real-life crime stories in India.

‘She used to go mad and hit anyone who tried to change the TV channel,’ her father said.

Santosh and Urvashi now have to accept the devastating possibility that their son may never be found.

‘Police searched a stretch of 15km but there was nothing. No one is looking now,’ Santosh added. ‘We’re lost, we just don’t know what to do.’
