Managers at a Co-op store resorted to displaying only empty jars of instant coffee because so much was being pinched.

Shoppers were told they could claim a full one at the till once they had paid.

The tactic, introduced in the centre of Blackpool two months ago, was deemed such a good idea a second branch did the same thing.

But the practice was stopped this week after the manager of a Tesco store spotted the empty jars and tweeted about them.

Matt Ashby sparked a debate by posting a picture of four shelves of empty coffee containers, including a £7.99 200g jar of Douwe Egberts and a £6.79 200g jar of Nescafe Gold Blend.

He tweeted: ‘Wow, all coffee in empty jars in Blackpool Co-op.’’

Twitter user Vickiaday noted: ‘I’ve just never seen empty jars before – it’s due to theft.’

The discussion was spotted by a Co-op manager, who tweeted: ‘Not how we would usually do it! Are you able to confirm which store so we can follow-up? Thanks.’

Full jars were back on the shelves on Friday.

A shop worker said: ‘We had been losing quite a bit.'

The Co-op said: ‘This is not a central policy.’

The tactic was introduced by staff two months ago in Blackpool, but was stopped this week following Mr Ashby's tweet (library image)
