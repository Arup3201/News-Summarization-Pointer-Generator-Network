George Boyd scored a famous Burnley winner as Manchester City's strongarm tactics backfired ahead of their big date in The Nou Camp.

Turf Moor was bouncing as Boyd lashed home a poor clearance from returning City captain Vincent Kompany after 61 minutes.

And Manuel Pellegrini's men – who sent on £50million substitutes Wilfried Bony and Stevan Jovetic to try and salvage the game – were lucky to survive with 11 men after bad challenges from Sergio Aguero and Martin Demichelis.

Host commentator

What a potential season-defining moment Burnley's win could be tonight. The victory still sees the Clarets in the relegation zone - but by only one point with Sunderland looking over their shoulders ever-more. Meanwhile the defeat for City is damaging for their title hopes. A win for Chelsea on Sunday would see Manuel Pellegrini's side trail by eight points with nine games remaining. City now have to pick themselves up with a daunting trip to Barcelona in the Champions League on Wednesday night. 

Until next time, have a good evening!

And the referee brings a close to the match. Relegation candidates Burnley have stunned the champions Manchester City! George Boyd's goal separates the two sides. Cue pandemonium among the Turf Moor faithful.

92 mins: Burnley make their second defensive change of the match as Danny Ings is taken off for Steven Reid. The hosts are now playing without any recognised strikers.

91 mins: Oh wow, what a huge moment in the match. Pablo Zabaleta charges into the Burnley box and falls under the challenge of Mee. On first inspection it looked a penalty and the replays suggest so too. However the referee decides otherwise and awards a free-kick to Burnley as Jason Shackell is fouled by Zabaleta during his tumble. The City players are incensed. Will that moment spell curtains for their title challenge?

There will be four minutes of injury time to be added on...

86 mins: Burnley make their first change of the match and it's a defensive one as striker Sam Vokes is replaced by Stephen Ward.

Lampard's appearance is his 600th in the Premier League. Only Ryan Giggs has made more.

82 mins: And that cross is Toure's last piece of action as he is replaced by Frank Lampard.

81 mins: What a chance that was for City to equalise. Navas cuts the ball back on the right flank to Yaya Toure. The latter whips in a devilish cross that finds the head of Aguero at the back post. The Argentina international can only head over from just outside the six-yard box though. The frustration grows for the visitors.

City are continuing to press for an equaliser but have yet to breach the Burnley defence. As they push further forward gaps are starting to appear which Burnley are beginning to exploit. The visitors have simply not been at it tonight, a huge credit must go to the Clarets though. They've been brilliant.

74 mins: Pellegrini makes his second change of the match as Silva is replaced by Stevan Jovetic.

71 mins: Two of Burnley's back four are now cautioned as Michael Duff sees yellow for a foul.

66 mins: City have just over 20 minutes plus added time to turnaround this scoreline. Victory for City would see them close the gap on Chelsea to two-points ahead of their match against Southampton on Sunday. A defeat means the Blues could go eight points clear if they beat the Saints. Do the City players want it enough?

63 mins: City react to conceding the opener by taking off the ineffectual Dzeko and replacing him with Wilfried Bony.

Demichelis' act of cynicism has been punished spectacularly by Burnley. From the resulting free-kick Trippier's set piece is headed away by City captain Vincent Kompany. Unfortunately for the defender his clearance falls straight to Boyd who hits a sweet left-footed volley first time that arrows into the bottom corner. A fantastic strike.

60 mins: Martin Demichelis swiftly follows Mee into the referees book for a cynical challenge on Ings.

58 mins: We have our first booking of the match and it's a harsh one as Ben Mee is cautioned for a challenge on Jesus Navas. Replays show it was a soft decision in comparison to some of the unpunished tackles that the City players have dealt.

55 mins: What a hit by George Boyd - he's so unlucky. The Scotland international hits a hook volley, with his weaker right foot, over his shoulder that narrowly goes past the post. That's got the crowd engaged.

51 mins: David Silva has just produced a collectors item - a bad touch. And at precisely the wrong time too. Aguero does brilliantly to spin around a Burnley defender on the halfway line and race clear. With Silva in support he plays in the playmaker but his first touch forces him wide with Heaton bearing down on him. That could, and probably should have been, 1-0 to the visitors.

Will the deadlock be broken in this stalemate?

A Manchester City fan has just proposed to his Burnley-supporting girlfriend on the pitch at half time. Thankfully she said yes because it’s a long walk back to the touchline. That’s the best entertainment we’ve had here so far.

Disappointing first half from the champions. Surely they haven’t got one eye on Barcelona when there’s still something to play for in the title race. City showed a few flashes towards the end of the first half but Tom Heaton has only had two saves to make, and fairly routine saves at that.

And the referee has drawn a close to first half proceedings at Turf Moor. In truth it's been a rather drab affair with no clear-cut chances yet created for either side. The hosts will be pleased with their display so far as they aim to avoid relegation, but City know they have to improve if they are to keep their hopes alive of retaining the Premier League title.

42 mins: City are dominating possession now and the stats support that with 70 per cent of the ball in their favour. However, the key statistic is that it is still 0-0. Can they make their dominance count?

34 mins: The visitors are slowly starting to come into the game more. Again Dzeko wriggles free inside in the Burnley box but is tackled before he can shoot. The ball falls into the path of Aguero who chooses to shoot rather the cross. The end product? An effort well wide of goal. Nevertheless a warning sign for the hosts.

29 mins: It's taken nearly half an hour but finally a keeper is forced into a save. Heaton comes off his line well to deny Dzeko from squeezing in a near post effort. From the resulting build-up the goalkeeper holds the ball well from an Aguero strike.  As the old saying goes, you wait ages for a bus and then two come along at once.

26 mins: And that trend continues as Edin Dzeko drags an ambitious left-footed shot well wide of Tom Heaton's goal.

23 mins: The fans have little to cheer about so far and it's hardly surprising. We're approaching the midway point of the first half and neither side has managed a shot on target yet.

15 mins: Still no clear-cut chances created by either side. Both goalkeepers have had yet to break sweat.

10 mins: Burnley right back Kieran Trippier crosses a ball that hits Gael Clichy. The home fans roar for a penalty but replays clearly show the ball hits the left back in the chest.

6 mins: As you would expect Burnley came out of the traps strongly in the opening exchanges. City have weathered that 'mini-storm' and are starting to express themselves.

The match has started in Lancashire. Can Burnley stun City?

Kick-off is imminent... 

Look away Burnley fans... City are unbeaten in their last six visits to Turf Moor in all competitions, winning the last five in a row and scoring 17 times in the last four. To make matters the visitors are unbeaten in their last 13 matches in all competitions against the Clarets (W8 D5 L0).

Records are there to be broken though...

In a close battle for the Premier League title, December 28 2014 could be a date that haunts City.

Leading 2-0 at half-time against Burnley, Manuel Pellegrini's side squander a two-goal lead to draw with Sean Dyche's men.

George Boyd scored straight after the break, turning home Danny Ings' shot while in an offside position.

Then Ashley Barnes reacted quickest in a crowded penalty area to smash home a loose ball to earn the visitors a draw.

Pellegrini knows his side can't afford a repeat performance like that if they are to close the gap on league leaders Chelsea.

Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany returns to the starting line-up after being an unused substitute against Leicester on 4 March. Quartet Pablo Zabaleta, Gael Clichy, Fernandinho and Edin Dzeko also start as Manuel Pellegrini rings the changes.

Right so the Burnley team news is and Mike Duff and Sam Vokes come in for Michael Keane and Michael Kightly in the only two changes for the Clarets from the side that lost 2-0 at Anfield against Liverpool.

Manchester City XI: Hart, Zabaleta, Kompany, Demichelis, Clichy, Navas, Fernandinho, Yaya Toure, Silva, Dzeko, Aguero

Subs: Caballero, Mangala, Sagna, Nasri, Lampard, Bony, Jovetic

Burnley XI: Heaton, Trippier, Shackell, Duff, Mee; Barnes, Arfield, Jones, Boyd; Ings, Vokes

Subs: Gilks, Keane, Reid, Ward, Jutkiewicz, Wallace, Kightly.
