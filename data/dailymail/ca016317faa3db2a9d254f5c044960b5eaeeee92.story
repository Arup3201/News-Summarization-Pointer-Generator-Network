An American-Israeli citizen locked up in a Cairo jail for allegedly spying was today embraced by his mother in an emotional reunion after Israel agreed to trade Egyptian prisoners for him.

Israel released 25 jailed Egyptians, most of them smugglers,
for the 27-year-old American-born Ilan Grapel, who previously served in the
Israeli military and was arrested in Cairo in June.

Israel's agreement highlights how brittle relations have
become between the two since the fall of Egypt's long-time leader Hosni Mubarak
- and that many on both sides want to preserve them.

The freed Egyptian prisoners passed into Sinai through a
land crossing from Israel and some of the Egyptian men kneeled to kiss the
asphalt after crossing through a blue metal gate at the border.

Many Israelis scoffed at the need for a deal to free a
citizen arrested by a friendly nation on what were widely believed to be
trumped-up allegations.

Israel Hasson, an Israeli lawmaker dispatched to Israel to
escort Mr Grapel from Egypt, said the Israeli government agreed to free
prisoners to ease recent tensions.

‘This event could have developed into a crisis and we don't
think either country needs that,’ he told Israel Radio. ‘This was not a
prisoner exchange. This was crisis prevention between Israel, the U.S. and
Egypt.’

In 1979, Israel and Egypt signed a U.S.-brokered peace
treaty, the first between Israel and an Arab state. Relations have always been
cool, but Mubarak carefully upheld the accord.

Egypt's new military leaders have vowed to do the same, but have
taken a tougher stance on Israel and grown closer to its enemy, the Hamas
militant group ruling coastal Palestinian territory Gaza.

Egypt's improved ties with Hamas appear to have helped
secure a long-elusive prisoner swap last week, when Israel agreed to trade
more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners for a single Israeli soldier.

That was Sergeant Gilad Schalit, who was captured and held
by Hamas in Gaza for more than five years. But Mr Grapel’s was a very different
case.

He was volunteering at a legal aid group in Cairo when he
was arrested in early June on suspicion of spying for Israel during the grass
roots revolt that overthrew Mubarak. He was never charged.

Mr Grapel made no secret of his Israeli background, entered
Egypt under his real name and his Facebook page had photos of him in an Israeli
military uniform.

Such openness about his identity suggested he was not a spy,
and even in Egypt, where hostility toward Israel runs high, the arrest was
widely ridiculed.

Mr Grapel was born in the U.S. and moved to Israel, where
his grandparents lived, as a young man.

He did his compulsory military service in Israel during its
2006 war with Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas and was wounded in the fighting. He
later returned to the U.S. to study.

element of regional peace and stability, and we strongly support both
countries' sustained commitment to its provisions'

After his legal internship in Cairo, he planned to return to
Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, for his final year of law school.

A smiling Mr Grapel looked fit after his one-hour flight
from Cairo. On the tarmac at Ben-Gurion International Airport outside Tel Aviv,
he embraced his tearful mother, Irene.

She had travelled to Israel from her home in Queens, New
York.

He was also greeted by U.S. Representative Gary Ackerman - a
Democratic congressman from New York for whom Grapel interned in 2002 - and
U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro.

The entourage then travelled to Jerusalem to meet with Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who warmly shook Mr Grapel's hand.

Mr Grapel plans to remain in Israel for at least two days to
meet with Israeli and American officials before returning to the U.S.

The U.S. Embassy in Cairo took the lead in Mr Grapel's case
because he entered Egypt with his U.S. passport, and Representative Ackerman
lobbied for his release.

In Washington, State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland
said the U.S. ‘worked hard to bring (Mr Grapel) home.’

She added: ‘The Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty is a vital
element of regional peace and stability, and we strongly support both
countries' sustained commitment to its provisions.’

Israel denied the allegations against Mr Grapel, as did his
family and friends.
