'The 2014 Hot List is a roundup of our very favorite 33 hotels to debut in the past year. So what are the criteria?

'A
 sense of place: a hotel that celebrates where it is in the world. A 
sense of personality: a hotel where it feels like every decoration has 
been hand-chosen by a person, not by a committee.

'A sense of intuition: a hotel where it feels like your needs are considered before you even know what they are.

'The
 result is a list that takes you around the world - from Kenya to Los 
Angeles, St. Petersburg to Phuket - and speaks to the passions and 
habits of the modern traveler.'

A spokesman for Rosewood Hotel, which boasts 262 rooms, said the building combines 'English heritage with contemporary sophistication', and has retained Belle Époque architectural features including the original carriageway entrance to the grand courtyard and a spectacular Pavonazzo marble staircase.

She added: 'We’d like to think we’ve been included in this prestigious list owing to the many elements of surprise and discovery in the design of Rosewood London.

'The design is conversational, intriguing and quite unexpected – but it’s essentially modern and metropolitan while still keeping the essence of this heritage building that has graced London for the past century.'
