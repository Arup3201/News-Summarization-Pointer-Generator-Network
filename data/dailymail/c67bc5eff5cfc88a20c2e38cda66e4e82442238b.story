It’s now a three-way battle for ownership of the North Pole, as Denmark revealed it will take on Canada and Russia amid claims its Greenland territory is connected to the pole via a ridge beneath the Arctic Ocean.

Huge, sparsely populated Greenland is semi-autonomous Danish territory and its continental shelf is linked to the pole by the 1,800km-long Lomonosov Ridge, which runs beneath the Arctic Ocean.

Foreign minister Martin Lidegaard will today deliver a claim to a United Nations panel in New York, as Denmark becomes the latest country to make a play for the vast untapped oil and gas reserves thought to lie beneath the ice.

The Lomonosov Ridge (shown in dark blue) links Greenland's continental shelf with the North Pole. The red dotted line shows the extent of the five Arctic countries' claims on the region under existing international law, which allows them to claim ownership of land up to 200 miles from their northern borders

The five Arctic countries — the United States, Russia, Norway, Canada and Denmark — all have areas surrounding the North Pole, but only Canada and Russia had indicated an interest in it before Denmark's claim.

Lidegaard told the Associated Press that the Arctic nations had so far ' stuck to the rules of the game' and he hoped they would continue to do so.

In 2008, the five pledged that control of the North Pole region would be decided in an orderly settlement within the framework of the UN, and possible overlapping claims would be dealt with bilaterally.

Interest in the Arctic is intensifying as global warming shrinks the polar ice, opening up possible resource development and new shipping lanes.

The area is believed to hold an estimated 13 per cent of the world's undiscovered oil and 30 per cent of its untapped gas.

Lidegaard said he expects no quick decisions, with other countries also sending in claims.

He said: 'This is a historical milestone for Denmark and many others as the area has an impact on the lives of lot of people.

‘After the UN panel had taken a decision based on scientific data, comes a political process. 

'I expect this to take some time. An answer will come in a few decades.'

Between 2007 and 2012, Danish scientists with colleagues from Canada, Sweden and Russia surveyed a 2,000km (1,240-mile)-long underwater mountain range that runs north of Siberia.

They concluded that Greenland is geologically attached to the ridge.

That prompted the Danes to claim the right to exploit an area of 345,600 square miles (895,00 square kilometres).

Christian Marcussen, a senior geophysicist with the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, said: 'The Lomonosov ridge is the natural extension of the Greenland shelf.

'Coincidentally, the North Pole which is a tiny, tiny abstract spot lies in the area.' 

Under international law, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia and the US - the five countries with territories near the Arctic Circle - are allotted 200 nautical miles of territory stretching from their northern coasts.

However, under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, exclusive claims can be vastly expanded for countries that can prove their part of the continental shelf extends beyond that zone.

In 2007, Russia sent a submarine to plant a flag 14,000ft beneath the ice of the North Pole in an audacious bid to lay claim to the resource-rich Arctic. 

Last year, Canada applied to extend the borders of its seabed in the Atlantic Ocean, including extensions into the Arctic seafloor covering roughly 656,000 square miles (1.7 million sq km).

This is roughly the size of Alberta and the Saskatchewan region combined. 

Now Denmark has made its move, claiming 345,600 square miles (895,000 square kilometres) of new territory.
