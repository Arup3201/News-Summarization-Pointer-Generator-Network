Straggly beards, duck calls and catching frogs aren't the first things that come to mind when you think of musicals - but that's not stopping the Robertsons.

The Duck Dynasty stars are working with Broadway producers on a 90-minute production about their 'rags to riches' story, which will open at in Las Vegas in February, the New York Times reported.

But already several Broadway producers have expressed their shock that colleagues would work with the family after its patriarch, Phil Robertson, made remarks comparing homosexuality to bestiality.

Jeff Calhoun, the director of 'The Duck Commander Family Musical', is himself gay but said they had already started working on the musical when Robertson made the comments to GQ last year.

Growing empire: The Robertson family, who star in 'Duck Dynasty', are now working with Broadway producers on a musical about their 'rags to riches' story, which will open at a casino in Las Vegas next year

Calhoun, who also directed 'Newsies' on Broadway, decided to press ahead with the project anyway. He told the newspaper that his husband's family share similar outlooks to the Robertsons.

'We've agreed to disagree on some things, but we're family and we love and respect each other,' he said. 'I like to think that this musical could bridge some gaps, too.'

He added that rather than shying away from the issue, they would be addressing the remarks in the musical - although the team said it is still working out how to do so. 

The show, which will open at the Rio hotel and casino, will feature actors playing the members of the Robertson family, who own a multi-millionaire duck call business in Louisiana. 

Controversial: The show was briefly suspended last year after patriarch Phil Robertson made homophobic remarks comparing homosexuality to bestiality. Despite repeating the remarks, the show is still on air

The musical might also feature video of the real family and duck hunting, as well as a 14 songs mixing country, blues and show tunes, the Times reported.

An opening number might be entitled, 'Faith, Food and Family'.

The show is based upon a book Willie Robertson, a star of the show and one of Phil Robertson's sons, wrote in 2012 with his wife.

'We've enjoyed the process of making a musical alongside the team who is interested in telling the Robertson family story from an outside perspective,' he said.

Michael David, a Broadway producer behind the show, said that the musical will challenge audiences more than other productions on stage.

'The Robertsons are so unusual, their story so juicy, and theater shouldn't be limited to telling stories about people you resemble or revere,' he said. 

Showtime: The musical will open at the Rio Hotel & Casino, where the Chippendales perform, in February

David, who also produced the 'Jersey Boys' for Las Vegas, said that he also believes Duck Dynasty could enjoy similar success, although there is no plan to take it to Broadway yet.

The family have starred in Duck Dynasty since 2012 and their seventh season starts next week. The show has had as many as 11 million viewers, although numbers dropped after the recent scandal.

'Everything is blurred on what’s right and what's wrong. Sin becomes fine,' he said in the interview last year. 'Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there.

'Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men... Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers - they won't inherit the kingdom of God.'

Despite A&E briefly dropping him from the show, he has not kept quiet about his homophobic views and has been filmed defending them on multiple occasions since.
