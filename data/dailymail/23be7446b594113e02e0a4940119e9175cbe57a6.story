Joe Launchbury has handed England a World Cup boost by declaring the spinal surgery he recently had a success — while targeting a return before the end of the season.

The 23-year-old lock, one of the first names on Stuart Lancaster’s team-sheet when fit, was operated on last month to correct a long-standing problem which had failed to improve despite missing November’s QBE series.

Following initial concerns Launchbury would not play again this season, leaving him just three summer warm-up games to prove his fitness for the World Cup in September, the Wasps star said he expects to play again by April.

The lock signed a new contract with Wasps on Thursday and is hoping to boost their options in April

‘The surgeon was really happy with how the operation went,’ he said on Thursday. ‘It wasn’t as bad as it was feared at one stage, so we’re looking at a gradual return to training in around 12 weeks.

‘For now I’m in the gym and it’s great to be able to concentrate on getting my arm and neck stronger rather than playing through pain.

‘I can feel a massive difference already. I’m targeting being back for April and am really looking forward to trying to play my part in Wasps’ campaign.’

Launchbury signed a new contract with Wasps last November and his decision to remain loyal to Dai Young’s men has played a central role in the club’s ability to retain players and attract stars.

Launchbury, who extended his deal again on Thursday, is one of eight players to re-sign as the club looks to build on its recent move to the Ricoh Arena.

Leicester are another Aviva Premiership club with grand ambitions and  it has emerged they are in talks with France captain Thierry Dusautoir.

‘We’ve talked to Thierry,’ said Leicester chief executive Simon Cohen. ‘Back row is an area we want to strengthen and there are some negotiations going on.’
