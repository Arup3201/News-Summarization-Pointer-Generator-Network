Moving on: Cristy Deweese tweeted this picture before going 'on-camera,' but it is not clear what the appearance was for

Parents and students have come out in support of a Dallas high school Spanish teacher fired last week for posing naked for Playboy while in college.

Cristy Nicole Deweese, 21, was terminated after it was learned she was featured in the magazine three years ago as 'Coed of the Month,' and many students and parents are unhappy with the termination.

Ms Deweese, who taught Spanish at Townview Magnet High School has been contacted by male and female students, a petition to reinstate her also garnered over 300 signatures.

The saucy Spanish teacher was fired late last week, according to the Dallas Observer, only days after her naughty past was made public.

Though she was not a Dallas Independent School District employee at the time the pictures were taken, administrators deemed her past inappropriate for a 21-year-old teaching students only a few years younger.

Ms Deweese has not waged a public battle with the school, instead focusing on the students, and they have returned the positivity in spades.

A number of former students have tweeted her directly saying they want her back.

'We all miss you so much & want u back bcuz we arent learning & these assignments are hard! U were my fave teacher, no joke,' one student tweeted Ms Deweese.

'I'm sorry :( if I could come back I would,' Ms Deweese replied. 'I miss y'all!'

Other students tweeted frowning pictures from classrooms and showed genuine affection for their fired teacher. Ms Deweese even told one student where to find the stickers she gave on tests and home work.

The best ever: A mother emailed the fired teacher to support her, even offering to write a letter of recommendation

Another student sent her a picture of the petition signed by hundreds, and Ms Deweese tweeted a picture of an email from a parent.

'You are the best Spanish teacher she has ever had,' the parent wrote. 'If you need a letter of support you can count on me as a parent and my daughter is willing to support you as well. Hang in there.'

A poll in a local report about the firing was overwhelmingly in the former Playboy model's favor - 88 per cent of the over 2,400 people who replied said she should not have been let go.

'I miss the kids, so I'm sad about that, but otherwise I'm doing fine,' she tweeted.

After thanking someone for their support, she tweeted 'I'm just hoping they find a new teacher soon so it doesn't affect the students.'

The former Playboy Coed of the Month (February 2011) looks to have moved on from being a teacher for the time being, based on a profile started on Model Mayhem.

'I've been modeling since I was 12, quit for a while to pursue teaching and now I'm back,' she wrote on the site.

Staying positive: Despite no longer being a teacher, Ms Deweese has remained positive and not hit out against the Dallas ISD - but she may have hired a lawyer

Though saying on Twitter she's unable to discuss her firing for now - perhaps a sign she's retained a lawyer, according to the Observer - she posted a picture on the social media site of herself before going 'on-camera.

She then tweeted a picture of herself on TV that she says her mother took. It is not clear if that on-cameraÂ  appearance was a modeling audition or for another reason.

Ms Deweese also tweeted that she signed a contract saying she can't do any media interviews until November 8.

Miss Deweese's sexy shots are available for all to see online - including the teenage boys she currently teaches.

Among her pictures are full-frontal naked shots, photos of her wearing 'winter bunny gear' and lingerie, a simulated lesbian sex scene and a 'Naked Outdoors' gallery.

In a behind-the-scenes video clip from the photoshoot, when asked about her hobbies, the teenager says: 'Hunting, shooting... I shot me a buck last year.'

She adds that she is majoring in Spanish and 'going to be a Spanish teacher'.

One parent, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Dallas Morning News that although her Playboy past should not prevent Miss Deweese from 
being a teacher, it did affect the way she is viewed by some students.

'Are her male 16- and 17-year-old students looking at her without picturing her nude?' Another added.

'And for the female students, is this someone they can respect as an educator, someone that they can look up to?'

The Dallas school district would not comment on Miss Deweese's pictures, saying that it was a 'personnel matter'.

She was not employed by the school district at the time the pictures were taken.
