Released: Rachel Dougall, 38, is to return to the UK after serving a 12-month sentence in Bali for failing to report a drugs crime

A British mother is expected to arrive back home tomorrow after spending 12 months behind bars in Bali for failing to report a drug-connected crime.

At one stage Rachel Dougall feared she would face the firing squad after British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford - who is herself on death row - accused her of being part of a British ‘gang of four’ involved in a major drug smuggling racket.

Miss Dougall, 38, was released from the notorious Kerobokan prison today and, local officials said, was immediately deported.

She is expected to join her parents at their home in Brighton, where she will be re-united with her seven-year-old daughter, Kitty.

Miss Dougall was arrested, along with her partner Julian Ponder, at their luxury Bali villa in May last year after Mrs Sandiford had accused them of being part of a syndicate behind the attempted importation of £1.6million of cocaine onto the island.

Local people on the holiday island referred to Miss Dougall and Ponder as the ‘King and Queen of Bali.’

That was the impression the pair gave to the farming community who toiled for £1 a day in the fields surrounding their luxury three-bedroom villa with its large swimming pool and marble floors.

But the couple, who locals said were too ‘high and mighty’ to talk to them, were shocked when drug squad officers raided their home and allegedly found two small packets of cocaine.

The police had gone there on information passed to them by Mrs Sandiford, now 56, who was caught with a suitcase full of cocaine as she passed through Bali airport and who is now appealing against the death sentence.

Miss Dougall, 38, escaped with a relatively light punishment, being given 12 months for failing to report a crime while Ponder, the father of their young daughter Kitty, has received six years.

Miss Dougall’s time has now been served and today she was released from Kerobokan Prison. She was expected to return to arrive back in Britain tomorrow or soon after.

She admitted in a number of interviews that the first weeks following her arrest were a ‘living hell’.

She was terrified that she would be given the death penalty and, in time, be led into an orchard in the dead of night, tied blindfolded to a stake and gunned down by a firing squad.

As she was dragged through the Indonesian court processes, uncertain of what her future would be, she lost weight, screamed that she was losing her mind and had to receive hospital treatment.

When she eventually learned that she would receive just one year, she said she just ‘settled down’ to wait out the time for her release.

Even so, tensions between her and Ponder, now 44, - who was sentenced to six years for drug possession - intensified in the prison.

Although separated in men’s and women’s quarters the pair were said to have been caught fighting through a fence.

Recently Miss Dougall admitted that it was ‘all over’ between them and she just wanted to get on with her life.

Ironically while she said she was looking forward to arriving home to be with her daughter and staying with her parents Stella and Paul in Brighton, she still intended to return to Bali before the end of the year.

She said she wanted to do that so that her daughter could be near her father and in any case she wanted to continue working at setting up the shoe business she was working on when she was arrested.
