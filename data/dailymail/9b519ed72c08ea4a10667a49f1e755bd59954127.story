For the purists and the patriots, there can be only one winner when the race for the Premier League crown reaches its climax just before 5pm on Sunday. And it will not be Manchester City.

City’s players suspect that respect for them and their football is the one quality that is in short supply as they sit just 90 minutes away from their second title in three seasons.

And their concern can only be heightened by the admission from FA chairman Greg Dyke that he finds it ‘depressing’ that a team can challenge for the biggest prize in the English game with so few Englishmen among their ranks.

So close: City will win their second league title in three years if they don't lose to West Ham

Dyke, who has drawn up controversial proposals that have now been published following an investigation into the dearth of top-quality English players, used the occasion to again voice his fears that top clubs are paying scant regard to the needs of the national side.

‘It’s been a brilliant league this year,’ said Dyke. ‘But there are only two regular England players at City, and two or three at Chelsea, and that’s pretty depressing.’

Although City seem destined to be champions, plenty of neutrals would prefer to see Liverpool win the title. And Dyke acknowledges the part played in the Anfield club’s challenge by their English contingent. ‘It’s good news for Roy Hodgson and good news for the campaign in  Brazil,’ he said.

The statistics tell their own story. While six English players have featured in more than 20 matches in Liverpool’s challenge, only Joe Hart and James Milner at City have played in more than 10.

And while Liverpool have had  Englishmen on the field for more than 40 per cent of the total time played, that figure is an alarmingly low 14 per cent at City.

Quota: Liverpool have had six English players play more than 20 matches in their title challenge

Even City’s achievement in scoring 100 League goals has gone largely unnoticed while the Merseysiders have hogged the limelight thanks to the scoring exploits of Luis Suarez, Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge.

Homegrown: James Milner is one of two Englishmen to play over 10 games this season in the league for City

With City needing just a point at home to West Ham today to be champions — Liverpool must beat Newcastle in case Manuel Pellegrini’s men slip up — nobody feels the lack of respect more deeply than City defender Martin Demichelis. After savage criticism, it is personal.

Written off as a slow, pony-tailed buffoon as City were beaten by Chelsea and Barcelona, the former Bayern Munich and Argentina defender has come to symbolise the club’s great comeback.

From being regarded as a joke by City fans and lambasted in TV studios, he is fast-emerging a popular cult figure and his remarkable renaissance has vindicated Pellegrini’s decision to bring the 33-year-old over from La Liga where they had worked together at Malaga.

‘The people who criticised me needed to be more respectful of me and what I’ve done during my career,’ said Demichelis. ‘I’ve now played nearly 11 years in Europe, including eight at Bayern Munich and I’ve won many trophies. That is not by chance. But I’m very grateful to Manuel for the support he has shown me.’

Demichelis also scored for Argentina at the last World Cup but that pedigree was ignored when he was sent off in the Champions League for bringing down Lionel Messi.

It was only when he became the team’s leader after Vincent  Kompany was sent off at Hull on March 15 that his and City’s season was transformed.

32 per cent of players who featured in the Premier League  this season were qualified for England — the lowest ever.

169 of the 532 players who appeared in the top flight are available to England boss Roy Hodgson.

103 of those have played more than 900 minutes, the equivalent of 10 games or more, and just 75 have played more than half the minutes possible.

23 per cent of the total minutes possible were played by English players at the top four clubs.

14 per cent of those total minutes played by English players at Manchester City.

16 per cent by English players at Arsenal.

24 per cent by English players at Chelsea.

40 per cent of total minutes by English players at Liverpool.

5 English players aged 18-21 played more than half the possible minutes.

13 countries at this World Cup have stars who’ve had more time per player in the Premier League than English players this season.

Solid: City petered off after a fine winter period, but have come back strong

‘I didn’t read and I try not to listen to too much of the criticism, but there was too much of it,’ he said. ‘The penalty against Messi and  Barcelona was one incident in a match where I actually thought I was playing really well.

Represent: Joe Hart is the only other English City player to play more than 10 league games

‘I started the season with an injury and I needed time to adjust physically. But as time has gone on, I have found my rhythm and been on an upward curve. And since that Barcelona game, I feel I’ve played at a high level for the last three months.

‘I’ve been through a lot of this through my career. But at no point did I stop believing in my own  ability. I always thought I could do this and I’m now where I want to be. I was well-respected in Germany who won many titles. There were no problems in Munich but I was a newly-arrived foreign player here.’ What was damaging when  Demichelis struggled was that it reflected badly on Pellegrini’s  judgment.

While Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers was lauded for his attacking philosophy and Chelsea’s Jose Mourinho hailed as a master of  tactics, City lost their way after  Sergio Aguero’s injury problems began in late January and the old doubts over Pellegrini — he has never won a major trophy in Europe — resurfaced.

Defeats against Barca and Wigan in the FA Cup destroyed a tilt at a unique Quadruple although City did win the Capital One Cup.

Yet when Chelsea and Liverpool slipped recently, City took advantage. Chelsea lost at Crystal Palace, Liverpool only drew there but City won 2-0 at Selhurst Park.

Having failed to lift La Liga with Real Madrid, Pellegrini is about to become a major winner. And he thinks the Premier League would be a bigger achievement.

‘The Premier League is the hardest to win. It’s the most competitive,’ he said. ‘Barcelona and Real Madrid have important players, so do  Bayern, but here there are five or six teams with a lot of potential in their squad. The intensity makes it different to anywhere else — every game is a final.’

He is taking nothing for granted today even though West Ham are safe and have nothing to play for.

‘We’ve planned for West Ham. We always consider the other team and their characteristics,’ he said.

National man: Dyke says it would be depressing for City to win the title with such little English representation

‘Andy Carroll is a very important player. West Ham play a lot to his strengths and we must be worried about that, pay attention and  concentrate with our defending.’

City nearly slipped up two years ago in the final game against QPR before Aguero’s late winner, so there will be no complacency today.

Demichelis is amused at the prospect of a duel with another ‘pony-tail’ in this title decider. ‘Carroll’s hair is more tied up in a bun really,’ he said, smiling ‘I’ve never played against him before but he’s not the only big striker in the Premier League. I trust in my experience and know how to deal with him.’

If ‘Aguerooooo’ was the hero in 2012, there are no shortage of candidates this time around.

Edin Dzeko, Yaya Toure and Alvaro Negredo have each scored more than 20 goals this season and David Silva is the best player in the League on current form.

TITLE

If Manchester City win today, they will win the title whatever happens elsewhere.If City draw, then Liverpool can win the title by beating Newcastle by a 13-goal margin.If City lose, any win for Liverpool will be good enough to take the title. A draw won’t be.

EUROPE

City, Liverpool, and Chelsea will go into the Champions League group stage directly, and Arsenal into the play-off round.Everton will go into the Europa League, and be joined by Tottenham unless Spurs lose at home to Villa and Manchester United win at Southampton, in which case United not Spurs will go into Europa League qualifying. Hull are guaranteedEuropa League football via being FA Cup finalists.

RELEGATION

Cardiff and Fulham are down and Will be joined by Norwich barring an impossibly freakish win over Arsenal at the same time as a home defeat for West Brom by Stoke in which Norwich overturn a 17-goal goal difference between themselves and West Brom.

Success: Man City are on the verge of winning their second league title in three years

Fernandinho, newly picked for the Brazil World Cup party, thinks City’s squad have given them the advantage. ‘We have a lot of options. We can change the games with substitutions and the manager has made a lot of good decisions on that.’

If City win today, their fans will hope it ushers in a new era of domination, similar to Liverpool and Manchester United. Financial fair play restrictions might be their biggest obstacle in the long term but Fernandinho said: ‘What happens tomorrow, nobody can know. But the club has built a team to win trophies. It’s our target.

‘We’ve won one title this year already and now we have the chance to win a second one. And the next years we’re going to try to do the same thing.’
