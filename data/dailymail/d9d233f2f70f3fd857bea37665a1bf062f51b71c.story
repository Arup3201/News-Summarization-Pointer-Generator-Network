The popularity of juice and smoothie diets has boomed on the back of celebrity-promoted fitness regimes. 

But the fad has suffered a blow after watchdogs crushed the health and fat-busting claims behind a string of recipes.

Ads featuring nutrition guru Madeleine Shaw asserted that juices containing watermelon, beetroot, pineapple and other fruit and vegetables could reduce fat and tone the stomach. Watchdogs, however, banned the commercials after ruling the claims were not backed up by robust scientific evidence.

The three ads were commissioned by Philips for its juicing machines. Sales of juicers have gone through the roof thanks to their association with the health regimes of stars such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.

These particular ads all starred Miss Shaw, whose clients include Made In Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh.

In the first commercial, she explained how to make a Watermelon Cooler juice, which she described as an ‘amazing fat buster’. The second showed her making a Classic Cleanse juice, which she said could ‘reboot’ the body. One of the key ingredients was beetroot, which she claimed ‘acts as a great cleanse for the liver’.

A third commercial, which appeared on the Philips YouTube channel, featured Miss Shaw making her Beat the Bloat juice, which contains mint leaves and pineapple and is ‘great for toning your tum’. 

Philips said the flesh of a watermelon contained citrulline, an amino acid that is converted by the body into arginine, which is said to improve blood flow and cardiovascular health.

It said there was preliminary evidence from animal studies that demonstrated a greater conversion of citrulline to arginine could help prevent excess accumulation of fat. It also said fresh mint was a diuretic that helped bowel movements and aided weight loss. 

However, the Advertising Standards Authority investigated the science behind the claims and found they did not stand up to scrutiny.

Specifically, the evidence – from a study on mice and an article on a website – was not good enough to demonstrate that watermelon and mint could contribute to fat loss.

The ASA said the claims about the benefits of the beetroot stemmed from research on liver injury in rats. It said there was no robust clinical evidence it could cleanse a human’s liver.

Philips argued the use of mint leaves and pineapple in its Beat the Bloat juice helped to eliminate excess gas around the stomach, so making the muscle tone appear more visible. 

But the ASA said the company could only provide articles from the internet, rather than robust clinical trials to back up its claims.

Given the lack of evidence, the watchdog found the commercials were misleading.

Miss Shaw insisted the juices she created would deliver health benefits. She said: ‘I firmly believe there are no quick fixes or short cuts in food and that juicing should be part of a well-balanced and nutritious diet.’

Philips said in future it would ensure any nutritional claims on behalf of the company would be backed by ‘robust’ evidence.
