Concerned: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is believed to be worried about a poll which shows that support for the Tories had dropped by 20 per cent among the Countryside Alliance

The Conservatives are haemorrhaging one in eight of their strongest supporters in the shires to Ukip.

An astonishing poll showed that support for the Tories had dropped by 20 per cent among the Countryside Alliance.

Its members are usually among the most committed Tory campaigners, with 15,000 of its supporters leafleting for the party at the last election.

The army of rural volunteers were part of the campaign group Vote OK, which is partly organised by David Cameron’s stepfather-in-law, Viscount Astor.

Rural campaigners helped the Tories win 36 target seats in 2010.

Election turn-out also went up whenever Vote OK poured its members into a constituency, according to a study by the Electoral Commission.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson was presented with a shock poll earlier a few weeks ago however showing that 13 per cent of Countryside Alliance members planned to vote UKIP at the general election.

Just 66 per cent would vote Tory if there was an election tomorrow, while 2 per cent would back Labour.

In 2006, a similar poll registered no support for UKIP among the 100,000-strong membership of the Countryside Alliance. Back then, 86 per cent said they would vote Conservative.

Mr Paterson is believed to have been worried by the poll and the impact the loss of Countryside Alliance support would have on the campaign network outside London, according to the Spectator Magazine.

Countryside campaigners feel betrayed by the Prime Minister’s failure to deliver on his promise of a free vote to repeal the hunting ban.

Tim Bonner, director of campaigns at the Countryside Alliance told the Mail: ‘A large part of the rural community is frustrated that government policies do not seem to take their views into account.

Issues like HS2, hunting and development in the countryside are hugely emotive and many living in the countryside feel the Government is more interested in urban issues and that their votes are being taken for granted. This situation has become a matter of trust between the countryside and the Government.’ Rural families pay 25 per cent more for fuel per month compared to those in urban areas.

They want the duty discount on petrol and diesel for those in the Hebrides, Northern Isles and the Isles of Scilly to be extended to other rural areas.

They were also concerned about a lack of affordable homes in the countryside, crime and poor broadband and mobile services.

Some 64 per cent of people living in the countryside do not believe coalition policies are helping them, and nearly three quarters,73 per cent, think politicians are more interested in the views and values of city residents.

Julian Price, an Oxfordshire farmer who canvassed for the Tories in target seats at the last two elections, told the Spectator he could no longer vote for the Tories.

‘I genuinely believe that Cameron has used us to get in and is now wiping his hands of us,’ he told the magazine. ‘All my family have always been Conservatives. But what they promised they would do for me they have gone back on. I genuinely feel that Ukip are more for us country people and farmers now.’

Before the last election, Mr Cameron described himself as a ‘country boy’ who had grown up fishing and ‘shooting rabbits’. He is also known to have been a member of his local Oxfordshire hunt. But he was foiled from going deer stalking this summer by his bad back.
