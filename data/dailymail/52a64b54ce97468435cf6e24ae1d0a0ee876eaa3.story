Guilty: Iain Merrick, 39, is facing jail after sending a homemade bomb to a post office in Manchester

A man is facing jail after sending a homemade bomb to a post office because he had developed a 'long-standing grudge' against the Royal Mail.

Iain Merrick, 39, claimed he was wrongly receiving up to 30 letters a day that were supposed to be delivered to his neighbours.

After making numerous complaints, he built an improvised device from nails, razor blades, light bulb fragments and fish hooks.

He then posted it in a letter box near his home in Horwich, near Bolton, Greater Manchester.

A postman later opened the postbox to find the cigarette packet-sized device, which had a 12-volt battery and two wires protruding from it - each one attached to a nail.

The discovery triggered a mass evacuation of the immediate area and a 100-metre cordon being placed around the scene, while bomb disposal experts were called to make the device safe.

If the two nails had touched, an electrical circuit would have been completed - prompting an intense fire which could have injured the postman.

Today, Merrick was found guilty of sending an explosive substance, as well as making and 
distributing indecent images.

When police searched Merrick's home, officers found a pen drive in a boiler cupboard which contained terrorism-related documents entitled Bombs: Explosives, Experiments, The Anarchist Cookbook and Mujahideen Explosives Handbook.

They also discovered he had also sent letters to six primary schools containing pornographic images of children - using the names and occupations of postal workers in a bid to smear them.

He had also put white stickers around the area falsely claiming one postal worker was a convicted paedophile.

Manchester Crown Court was told Merrick had developed a 'long-standing grudge' toward employees of the Royal Mail in 2008 after he began to experience problems with his post at his flat where he lived alone.

Merrick claimed his upstairs neighbour would mistakenly receive his post - causing him to ask for his own mail to be redirected to another address for six months.

Eventually it was agreed that staff would hold his mail at the post office and he would go to collect it personally.

Grudge: Merrick developed a 'long-standing grudge' against the Royal Mail after 'wrongly receiving up to 30 letters a day that were supposed to be delivered to his neighbours', Manchester Crown Court heard

But in July 2010, he complained of receiving letters addressed to his neighbour and made several complaints to the post office.

During the trial, Merrick said: 'It could range from three to four letters a week to 30 a day, more than that. I did go down to the depot, but they said they are not allowed to hold onto any mail.

However, the court was told Merrick became 'obsessive' about his mail and would constantly carry a voice recorder in his pocket so he could record every conversation he had with postal workers during complaints.

Later, he researched the postmen on Google and the electoral role in an attempt to find out where they lived.

Making the area safe: Police stand guard in a street close to where Merrick's bomb was discovered

In November 2010, police spoke to Merrick about him harassing Royal Mail workers - causing him to reply: 'I'm not going to send a bomb in the mail or anything'.

The following April, the homemade bomb was found by postman Ian Platt as he emptied the postbox outside Winter Hey post office.

Vanessa Thomson, prosecuting, said: 'He had a long-standing grudge towards employees of the Royal Mail. This grudge caused him to harass postal workers in a variety of ways but that conduct turned quite sinister.'

Police raided Merrick's home in September 2012 and discovered a pen drive containing a folder entitled 'Dangerous'.

It comprised hundreds of pages including an article containing a diagram and instructions on how to make a pipe bomb from a 2010 issue of the terrorist publication 'Inspire'.

Another folder provided details of how to handle chemicals, the methods used to make explosives and how to avoid detection.

Officers also found handwriting and scribbles with legible words and phrases related to 
creating explosive devices, such as 'gunpowder,' 'flash paper' and 'big 
boom.'

They later discovered 533 indecent images of children and internet searches for mocked-up 'psuedo' nude images of Harry Potter actress Emma Watson.

Forensic analysis of Merrick's DNA found 13 matches on the bomb. He had also posted videos on how to make a pipe bomb and the mechanics of an electronic fly zapper on YouTube.

However, when questioned, Merrick denied any wrongdoing and claimed he had been 'experimenting' with chemicals at home.

He added that he had even 'blown himself up' twice during his bizarre experiments.

Speaking outside court, Detective Sargent Russ Stubbs, of the North West Counter Terrorism Unit, said: 'Merrick waged a one-man crusade against the post office, a one-sided conflict that seems to have been ignited by the tiniest of sparks.

'A perceived problem with mail going to the wrong house was all it took for Merrick to launch an escalating vendetta which involved sexual slurs and sending a letter bomb to a post office.

'Had this crude device gone off, then the unfortunate postal worker who opened it could have suffered very serious injuries.

'You do not need a vivid imagination to foresee the kind of damage that razor blades and fish hooks could have caused to a human being.

'One of his most damaging actions was to post indecent images of children and babies to local primary schools, with details of two postal workers on the back.

'Had this information got out into the wider public, as was presumably his intention, then these completely innocent people would not only have had their careers and reputations destroyed, but they could have been subjected to vigilante attacks.

'Thankfully Merrick was never allowed to succeed in his plans which could have left careers destroyed and innocent postal workers with severe mental distress and physical injury.'

Merrick has been remanded in custody until sentencing in February.
