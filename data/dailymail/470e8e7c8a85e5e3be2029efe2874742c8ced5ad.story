A disgraced doctor who was jailed for killing two prostitutes in 2011 went on drug-fueled sex binges with other escorts, spending more than $140,000 in a nine-month period between their deaths, an investigation has revealed.

And instead of being barred from visiting Sydney brothels after he was deemed a risk to the safety of sex workers, Malaysian national Suresh Nair was given free rein to spend his thousands on drugs and the services of brothel clients he fed them to.

The Sun Herald has published details of the former Nepean Hospital doctor's extravagant episodes with women and drugs, including one 25-hour binge in the weeks leading up to the death of sex worker Suellen Zaupa.

Suellen Zaupa died in November 2009 when she was involved in one of Nair's sordid sex binges

Victoria McIntyre died in February of the same year Ms Zauapa death. Between their deaths, Nair went on a rampage of drug-induced sex binges with prostitutes

Ms Zaupa, 22, died in November 2009 nine months after he killed Victoria McIntyre, 23, during separate drug-fueled sex orgies.

He was jailed for eight years for manslaughter back in 2011, but on appeal, had his sentence downgraded to five years and four months and will be eligible for parole in July.

And while he prepares to walk free, a dossier of his elaborate dealings in the months between his victim's deaths have been revealed.

The investigation shows Nair's continued abuse of drugs and the women he shared them with, including an elaborate day of binging just weeks leading up to his second victim's demise.

During the 25-hour ordeal on September 11 and 12, 2009, Nair spent close to $57,000 on drugs and the services of women at a room at Liaisons brothel, Edgecliff.

Receipt records show he spent about $15,000 for the services of nine sex workers, while the rest was listed under 'fantasy', 'cash out' and 'advance', words commonly used to disguise the drugs he paid for at the venue.

Arriving at Liaisons at 10.50pm on September 11, the day-long sex romp lasted until 11.50pm the following night, but it was by no means an isolated occasion.

In May, Nair booked four girls for another of his all-night binges, which cost $19,640 - $10,000 of which was marked down as 'tips', and in August, he arrived at the same brothel after midnight where he paid $8,905 for the services of two escorts during a six-hour orgy

But according to a document obtained by The Sun Herald, none of these events should ever have taken place because the brothel was aware that Nair was a high risk to workers' safety.

A state government letter circulated to Sydney brothels warned of a prostitute's near-death ordeal in Kings Cross at the hands of a 'doctor' of Indian appearance, named 'Suresh'.

The woman subsequently collapsed from a drug overdose, sparking the warning which was kept secret from the public but circulated via a closed sex industry publication called the Ugly Mug List.

The Ugly Mug List, which an industry boss said all brothels read, serves to unify and protect sex workers by outing dangerous clients.

Nine women received $18,305, including a house cut

 $17,320 billed as 'Cash out'

$20,330 billed as an 'Advance'

$450 billed as a 'Tip'

$56,405 in total

The owner of consultancy firm Brothel Busters, Chris Seage, told the Sun Herald it was unbelievable that the brothels were ignoring the government advice about Nair.

'Everyone in the industry reads the Ugly Mug list so it is disappointing that some businesses continued to compromise lives by allowing women to see Nair,' he told the Sun Herald.

He also said Nair, who is eligible for parole in July, should not be granted it until he comes clean about where he got his drugs from.

'He should not be given parole until he informs police of the names of the escort agencies and brothels that were supplying him.'

He said it was disappointing that some businesses continued to compromise lives by allowing women to see Nair.

Aside from the two sex workers he killed and the numerous women's lives he put at risk, there remains an unknown number of hospital patients whose operations went wrong as the neurosurgeon continued his day job at Nepean Hospital.

The NSW Health Care Complaints Commission cancelled Nair’s registration as a medical practitioner in December, and he is not eligible to apply for re-registration until 31 December 2019.
