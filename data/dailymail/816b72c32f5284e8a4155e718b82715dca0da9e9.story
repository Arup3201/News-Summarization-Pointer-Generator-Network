Disgraced celebrity publicist Max Clifford’s wife has filed for divorce, it has emerged just days after he was jailed for a campaign of sexual abuse against teenage girls, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Clifford, 71, is the first person to be convicted under Operation Yewtree and was sentenced to eight years after a judge ruled he had groomed and degraded his victims.

Now it has emerged that his 51-year-old wife Jo – who was conspicuous by her absence during the trial and was not called as a character witness – has started divorce proceedings against her millionaire husband.

Mrs Clifford, who was his PA before the pair married in April, 2010, has instructed celebrity divorce lawyer Raymond Tooth, who is thought to charge £450 an hour and is known as ‘Jaws’ because of his formidable reputation.

Mr Tooth, who is renowned for negotiating multi-million pound  settlements, has a long list of famous clients including Irina Abramovich, former wife of billionaire Chelsea Football Club chairman Roman, actor Jude Law’s former wife Sadie Frost and rock star Eric Clapton’s ex, Pattie Boyd.

Last night the lawyer, whose motto is ‘Don’t get even – get Tooth’, confirmed the split.

He said: ‘They are divorcing. There are no disputed matters. Everything has been sorted out amicably so it’s all done.’

Mrs Clifford married the publicist seven years after the death of his first wife, Liz.

A source close to the family said: ‘The divorce was nothing to do with the court case. The fault lines were there long before and the separation has been amicable.’

Mrs Clifford has previously refused to comment on the divorce, and on the day her husband received his guilty verdicts she was spotted without her wedding ring strolling in the Cotswolds village where she has a £600,000 three-bedroom cottage.

It is understood that the divorce  is in its very early stages, with  the decree nisi – which confirms the petitioner is entitled to a divorce  – yet to be formally granted by  a judge.

But a source said: ‘It’s just a matter of time before the judge does grant it and then it will be a few weeks before the decree absolute is issued and the divorce is official.’

Clifford was jailed at Southwark Crown Court on May 2 after he was found guilty of eight counts of indecent assault against four girls between 1977 and 1985.

Judge Anthony Leonard said that some of the offences would have  led to charges of rape if they had happened today.

Last week, one of Clifford’s  victims, Sharon Elliott, 48, waived her right to anonymity to exclusively tell The Mail on Sunday that she felt vindicated after hearing the judge’s verdict.

Ms Elliott, who was indecently assaulted in a nightclub toilet by Clifford when she was an 18-year-old dancer, said: ‘The eight year sentence is a positive result for us women and when I heard the judge condemn Clifford for what he said to me, I felt I’d got justice.’

Clifford had sneered at Sharon after the assault, telling her: ‘Don’t bother telling anyone – they won’t believe you.’
