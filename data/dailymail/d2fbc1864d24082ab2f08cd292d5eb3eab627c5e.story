Wayne Rooney has hit back at critic Paul Scholes after ending his eight-month England goal drought - insisting he is fit and hungry to play in Saturday’s final World Cup warm-up game against Honduras.

Scholes claimed that Rooney is a fading force who faces being dropped for the World Cup.

But Rooney has pointed out that his former Manchester United team-mate has been little more than a peripheral figure at the club recently - only returning to the coaching staff when Ryan Giggs was made caretaker boss in April.

‘He’s been a team-mate but he’s been away from the first team for a long time,’ said Rooney. ‘I’ve seen a lot of people saying he’s coached me and been around the team but he hasn’t.

‘I’m not really going to react. I’m not interested. He’s got his opinions so let’s leave it at that. To be honest I’m not really interested in what anyone else has got to say.

‘I’m interested in what Roy Hodgson and the coaching staff here and the people around me say. People have their opinions but I don’t agree with them.’

Scholes’ comments opened a debate which was fuelled when Roy Hodgson decided to play Rooney on the left wing against Ecuador on Wednesday.

Rooney, who missed the end of the Barclays Premier League season with a groin problem, is the only outfield player to start both of  England’s warm-up games.

He scored their opener in the 2-2 draw with Ecuador in Miami, his first international goal since October.

‘I can play in different  positions,’ said Rooney. ‘I’ve proved I can play on the left over the years. The manager didn’t have to tell me what to do. I know how to play that role. I’ve played it many times and I’ve no problem doing that. He didn’t have to explain it to me.

‘It is down to the manager. It’s not about me, it’s about the team. If the manager wants to play me up top, in behind, left, right, I’m happy to do that.

‘I’m ready to play. I hope to play against Honduras. I’ve trained hard, I have no  injuries or any recurrence of the groin strain I had at the end of the season.

‘I always needed game time. I felt really good, especially in the heat. I’m sure the  manager will have a tough decision but I’m ready.’

Rooney and Daniel Sturridge may need to refine their partnership if they are to play in tandem, as they did in the 3-0 win against Peru on Saturday. But the Manchester United striker pointed out: ‘I think in every game we’ve played together, one of us has scored.’

His facts are slightly skewed. The strikers have scored five between them in seven appearances together. Sturridge, rested against Ecuador, has scored in his last two England games — against Denmark and Peru.

Rooney said: ‘Daniel’s a fantastic player. He can score goals from anywhere, like he did at Wembley.

‘We have trained a lot together so hopefully we can take that form into the tournament.’

David Moyes yesterday added his voice to those calling for Rooney to start in the World Cup.

The former United manager said: ‘He has to play. He has the ability to score, he has the mental strength to handle the games. In those games you look to your big players and Wayne will be a big player for England. 

‘But there is an awful lot of pressure being lumped on him, which isn’t right. England haven’t done particularly well in a lot of competitions, so no one should be expecting great things from them.

'To be a stand-out and make a difference in World Cup games is very hard. For me, Wayne would definitely start. He has the experience of past tournaments.’

In charge: England boss Roy Hodgson must decide where is best to play Rooney against Italy

‘I think he is in a better place than he was this time last year.

‘He is playing well and his form has been good and I do think he has already come out and said he wants to have a good World Cup - you have to trust him and go with that. 

‘He will be determined to do well. He knows how important this is for him. Wayne will be desperate to show everyone what he can do.

‘In his mind, he is strong and he will be determined to go out and show how good he is, with a determination to do the job. But you have to remember that the opposition can make it difficult for players as well. 

‘He will also need good service and good players around him. Wayne cannot make it happen all on his own.’
