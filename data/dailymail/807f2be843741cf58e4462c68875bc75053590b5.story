Which country boasts the best league in Europe and how do we determine such?

Heard that before? One suggestion was to have the 20 teams from two nations play each other in order of position - 1st versus 1st, 2nd versus 2nd and so on – and calculate a score based on the outcomes.

This Ryder Cup style scenario will never happen, of course, but this week an Anglo-Germanic playoff of sorts on the continental stage is taking place.

It will not provide a definitive answer to the Premier League-versus-Bundesliga debate, but we will learn how the top clubs from those respective countries are set to fare at the onset of the European campaign.

And the Champions league action has given a clear indicator that the Premier League is lagging behind its German counterparts.

Borussia Dortmund got things underway by beating Arsenal 2-0 on Tuesday night with a display far more convincing than the scoreline suggested.

Bayern Munich added another win for the Germans when a late Jerome Boateng striker edged out a resilient Manchester City.

And even unfancied Schalke, beset by injuries, managed to get in on the act with a precious point at in-form Chelsea. Some might even argue there's was a morale victory given that nobody gave the Germans a chance before kick-off.

Next up is the Europa League, where Everton remain the Premier League's remaining opportunity to land a blow on the Bundesliga in this first round of European fixtures when they entertain Wolfsburg at Goodison Park.

Everton vs Wolfsburg – Thursday, Europa League Group H

After a five-year absence Everton return to Europe and manager Roberto Martinez is promising to make every effort to win the competition. The Spaniard sees the Europa League as a platform to greater things rather than an unwanted distraction.

Like the Toffees, Wolfsburg were fifth last season and have former Chelsea forward Kevin De Bruyne – an £18million signing in January – as their key offensive threat.

But De Bruyne and co have struggled this season. They have picked up just two points in the league and needed penalties to get past second tier SV Darmstadt in the cup.

Everton, likewise, were slow to find their stride but a convincing 2-0 win at West Brom on Saturday gives them momentum heading into their first taste of Thursday-Sunday football since 2009/10.
