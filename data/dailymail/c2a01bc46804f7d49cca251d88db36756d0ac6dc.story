Chelsea playmaker Eden Hazard has followed in the footsteps of a number of Premier League greats, and been chosen to appear on the UK cover of EA Sports' latest FIFA game.

Hazard will be pictured with Lionel Messi on the front cover of FIFA 15, and joins the likes of Gareth Bale, Wayne Rooney and Frank Lampard in the list of UK cover stars.

EA Sports built up the anticipation on their FIFA Twitter feed by posting a teaser picture of a  space next to Messi before making the announcement.

Chelsea were clearly pleased with the endorsement of their attacking midfielder, and tweeted the announcement themselves almost straight away.

Hazard had an indifferent World Cup for Belgium, but started for the Blues on Monday and helped his side to a 3-1 win away at Burnley.

Next up for Chelsea is a home match against Leicester on Saturday, and video game icon Hazard will be keen to show he is just as effective in real life as in the computer game.
