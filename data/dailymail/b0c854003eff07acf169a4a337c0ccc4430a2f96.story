Britain will be the best performing major economy in the developed world this year and will grow at nearly twice the pace of the US, a global financial watchdog declared last night.

The International Monetary Fund said it now expects output in the UK to rise by 3.2 per cent in 2014 – leaving rival economies such as the US, Germany and France trailing in its wake.

The IMF said Britain had delivered one of the few ‘upside surprises’ so far this year and warned that the global outlook has deteriorated.

The International Monetary Fund now expects the British economy to grow by 3.2 per cent this year, faster than every major economy

It said ‘increased geopolitical risks’ – both in Ukraine and the Middle East – ‘could lead to sharply higher oil prices’ as it slashed its forecasts for Russia.

Ministers said Britain is now ‘in the fast lane of recovery’ following the deepest slump in post-war history when the economy crashed by 7.2 per cent under Labour.

Official figures published today look set to show that the UK is now producing more than it was before the recession struck – bringing the longest downturn on record to an end. 

Analysts expect the Office for National Statistics to say gross domestic product increased by around 0.8 per cent between April and June – taking it past the pre-recession peak.

Paul Hollingsworth, an economist at Capital Economics, said it ‘would mark another milestone for the recovery’.

The latest forecasts from the IMF are another victory for George Osborne, who only 15 months ago was accused by its chief economist of ‘playing with fire’ by pressing ahead with austerity.

The Fund has since admitted it was ‘too pessimistic’ about the UK – and upgraded its forecasts for 2014 four times in the last nine months.

It is a major boost for Chancellor George Osborne who was last year warned by the IMF that he was 'playing with fire' by pressing ahead with spending cuts

This time last year it was predicting annual growth of only 1.5 per cent – less than half of what it now expects – and as recently as April pencilled in 2.9 per cent.

The latest upgrade was the largest positive revision for any country in the G7 – which also includes the US, Canada, Japan, Germany, France and Italy – and the BRIC economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China.

The Chancellor said: ‘The IMF has upgraded their 2014 forecast for the UK by more than any other major economy.

‘The Government’s long-term economic plan is working. But the job is not yet done and so we will go on making the assessment of what needs to be done to secure a brighter economic future.’

David Cameron said ‘more growth means more jobs and more security for families’.

The IMF cut its global growth forecast for this year from 3.7 per cent to 3.4 per cent and warned of ‘downside risks’ – including in Russia and the Middle East. The US economy is expected to grow by 1.7 per cent this year, down from the 2.8 per cent expected in April, while the outlook for the eurozone was unchanged at 1.1 per cent.

Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls said it has taken two years longer than planned for the economy to return to pre-crash levels

IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard said: ‘The recovery in the euro area remains weak and inflation is too low.’

Germany’s economy is now expected to grow by 1.9 per cent this year, up from the 1.7 per cent expected in April. But the IMF cut its forecast for France from 1 per cent to 0.7 per cent.

Russia’s fragile economy is expected to all but grind to a halt this year as the crisis in Ukraine takes its toll.

The IMF said the Russian economy will grow by only 0.2 per cent this year following expansion of 3.4 per cent in 2012 and 1.3 per cent last year. It also slashed its growth forecast for next year to only 1 per cent.

Ruth Porter, head of economics and social policy at the Policy Exchange think-tank, said: ‘The IMF is eating humble pie again.

‘Britain’s economic plan to get the public finances in order has helped raise business confidence and assisted in restoring growth to the economy.

‘Beating other major economies, these figures are a real coup for the Chancellor.’

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said that despite the recovery ‘most people are worse off’ and face ‘a lost decade for living standards’.

TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘Pay packets are still falling behind rising prices, so most people are not yet sharing in the recovery. If the good news on growth is going to last, real wages must start improving too.’
