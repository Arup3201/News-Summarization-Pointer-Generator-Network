Sally Pearson after triumphing in the 100m women's hurdles

Australian sprinter Sally Pearson has shrugged off the weight of a tumultuous week at the Commonwealth Games by winning back-to-back gold in her pet track event the 100m hurdles.

Pearson won gold in 12.67s - quicker again than her semi final win - to defeat rival Tiffany Porter who ran 12.80, with Canada's Angela Whyte bronze in 13.02 on a day where Australia hauled in four gold.

A jubilant Pearson, who had stayed silent on the sacking of coach Eric Hollingswoth earlier in the week, made a statement louder than any words could when she flew home in the final before celebrating with fans post-race.

The 27-year-old capped off not only a personal milestone but a big day for Australians generally with four athletes bagging golds on day nine.

Rookie high jumper Eleanor Patterson, discus thrower Dani Samuels and diver Matthew Mitcham also made their statements on the world stage.

Mitcham broke through to win his first Commonwealth Gold after six attempts, while discus thrower  Dani Samuels lived up to her favourites’ tag with a dominant win in the women’s event.

She threw  64.88m, almost 3m ahead of her nearest competitor.

Australian Hannah Joye, who was also competing in the final, finished sixth with a personal best of 1.89 metres.

But the day belonged to Pearson, who put all the controversy of her troubled relationship with Hollingsworth behind her when he was sacked for comments he made earlier in the week.

He had said that Pearson set a bad example to younger athletes by not appearing at the team camp in Gateshead last week.

Athletics Australia released a statement condemning Hollingsworth for the fact he said anything, for what he said about Pearson in particular, and for the timing of what he said.

When asked how she put the sensational sacking of her coach behind her and remain so calm in the build-up to the final, Pearson said she reverted to simple tactics.

'I’ve done this a million times before. I know how to win, I know how to race. It’s just another day at the office,' she told Channel 10.

'It’s just another 100 metres with 10 hurdles in the way. I’ve done this a million times.'

It is the 27-year-old's second Commonwealth Games gold in the 100m hurdles after winning the same event at Delhi in 2010.
