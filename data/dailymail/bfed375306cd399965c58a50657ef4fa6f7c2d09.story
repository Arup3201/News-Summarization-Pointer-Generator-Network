Violent offenders may have to wear electronic ankle tags following the horrific murder of an 11-year-old boy who was beaten to death by his abusive father earlier in the year.

This is a $150 million proposal put forward by the Victorian government as part of their re-election campaign to order high-risk perpetrators to wear GPS trackers while victims would be given separate devices to trigger an alarm if offenders approached.

It comes eight months after Luke Batty was killed by his deranged father Greg Anderson, who attacked his son at cricket training, despite an intervention order placed against him by the boy's mother.

On the evening of February 12, Rosie Batty watched in horror as her ex-partner Greg Anderson stabbed and beat their son to death with a cricket bat after a training session at Tyabb Cricket Ground, south of Melbourne. 

While emergency services were too late to save the 11-year-old, who died at the scene, police attempted to subdue the father with capsicum spray 

Witnesses included parents and children who were gathered at the grounds for evening cricket training and watched on as the 54-year-old father charged with a knife at one of the officers, who shot him dead.

Ms Batty had previously taken out domestic violence warrants on her deranged ex-partner.

The Victorian government's pledge for electronic ankle tags on violent offenders would follow a pilot program next year, as part of the $150 million package announced on Saturday.

Premier Denis Napthine says it would be a quicker way of dealing with the scourge than the Labor Party's plan to hold a royal commission into the issue.

'This pilot will help us evaluate how effective GPS can be to prevent family violence and help women and children feel safer,' he told the Herald Sun.

'When we identify opportunities to protect Victorians from family violence, we will act immediately,' he said.
