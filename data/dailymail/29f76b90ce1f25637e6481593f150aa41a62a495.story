Real Madrid supporters booed coach Carlo Ancelotti and goalkeeper Iker Casillas but saw their team win 2-0 against Deportivo to stay clear at the top of La Liga.

There were even a few jeers for an out-of-sorts for Cristiano Ronaldo when he blasted a second half free-kick over but the Balon D’Or set up the second for Karim Benzema after Isco had scored the first.

Those goals saw Real move four points clear of closest rivals Barcelona in the battle for the La Liga title.

See how they got on as it happened from our live updates: 

Karim Benzema's goal helped Real Madrid to bounce back from their 4-0 defeat to Atletico Madrid 

Host commentator

Three important points for Real Madrid - and it puts them four points clear of Barcelona. They, and Atletico Madrid, play tomorrow.

We hope you have enjoyed our updates, now switch over to follow our coverage of Crystal Palace vs Liverpool HERE. It's currently 1-1.

Cheers!

That's it. Unconvincing but Real still win with goals from Isco and Karim Benzema.

The worry will be Marcelo's injury. He ended the game walking around the pitch in just his socks after falling awkwardly.

Madrid are already patching together a back four as it is and Carlo Ancelotti will hope he and Pepe are back for the Champions League tie with Schalke this week.

Real left-back Marcelo is down after falling awkwardly in a challenge. Ancelotti will be hopefully this isn't adding to their injury problems....

Ronaldo almost makes it 3-0. Great run by Jese down the right, he crosses in for Ronaldo to volley but it bounces just wide of the post.

Off comes Real Madrid's second goalscorer. Jese Rodriguez is on in his place.

Juan Dominiguez comes on for Borges.

He'll be suspended for Deportivo's next game now after he brings down and on-rushing Ronaldo a little outside the area.

Bale will take the free-kick....and it's theatrically punched away by Fabricio.

Not bad for someone that's renowned for being a bit greedy...

Lucas Perez off, Haris Medunjanin on for Deportivo.

Goalscorer Isco off for Real, to a standing ovation, replaced by Dani Carvajal.

Ronaldo breaks down the right but he can't find Benzema to add to his goal. Straight away Deportivo break though and they win a free-kick on the edge of Casillas' area.

That should be enough for Real Madrid. Karim Benzema makes it 2-0. Cristiano Ronaldo knocks on a pass from Arbeloa and the Frenchman dinks the finish over the keeper. That's the three points in the bag. 17 minute left.

The Brazilian 21-year-old, signed in January from Cruziero, comes on for Asier Illarramendi.

A 1-0 win over Deportivo with Ronaldo blasting free-kicks into the stand and struggling against a 39-year-old full-back will do nothing to change the mood in Madrid. We'll be in for another week of hand wringing and chin scratching if the result stays this close.

Shot from Marcelo but it's easily saved by the keeper. He fought through a couple of challenges on the left and then shot when he probably should have passed.

Benzema then sees another shot saved by Fabricio.

They're looking more threatening but these efforts are weak.

21-year-old Helder Costa comes on for Oriol Riera. He looks unimpressed, although he has faded since a decent opening.

Ronaldo steps up for the free-kick.... Miles over. Row Z. 

Isco made the difference at the attacking end earlier and now he's doing it in his own box. He proves Real's saviour to cut out a deep cross with an excellent touch. The Bernabeu sings his name.

Real get down the other end and win a soft free-kick for Manuel Pablo challenge. He gets booked.

A few injuries in Carlo Ancelotti's squad at the minute so he's relying on the club's youth to make up the numbers.

Jese Rodriguez, Alvaro Medran and Derik Osede

Deportivo have to start taking these chances during a strong spell for the visitors. Madrid are now starting to get back into it as we reach the 55-minute mark.

Slow start from Madrid again and Celso Borges hits the post with a left-footed strike inside the box. Moments later Casillas has to react brilliantly to tip away a header that deflected off Nacho.

And we're off... Can Real Madrid add to their lead? Hopefully Ronaldo has his shooting boots on for this second period.

Second half from Madrid coming up...

They've looked a little vulnerable and Ronaldo's been all over the place but who cares? Real lead 1-0 courtesy of Isco's curler.

Deportivo are playing some nice stuff but they can't get round that Real Madrid backline and particularly Rafael Varane.

Real try to break quickly from a Deportivo corner and Celso Borges grabs at Toni Kroos and is booked.

Ronaldo goes down in the box and is warned by the referee for his protests. It looked a lot like a dive - he could probably do with half-time arriving soon.

And Gareth Bale is now down just outside the box - again the referee didn't pay any attention to his appeals.

What is up with the Ballon d'Or winner? He's missed another chance here after Gareth Bale glides down the right, crosses in and Ronaldo heads over. He could even have left it for Isco to volley...that might have been a better shout.

Cristiano Ronaldo may be looking a little out-of-sorts, and he's tackled out on the wing again here, but Gareth Bale is taking up his slack.

The Welshman has already hit the bar and set up numerous chances for his team-mates, including Ronaldo's embarrassing miss.

Ronaldo fails to finish from a yard out and Isco saves the day. It's a boost for the team but Ronaldo's miss won't have helped his state of mind. Deportivo should cave in now. Madrid need a big win after those boos at the start of the game.

Isco curls in the opener to finally give Real Madrid the lead. The ball comes to him on the edge of the box and he gives Fabricio absolutely no chance, curling into the corner.

Just before that Ronaldo had missed an absolute sitter on the line when set up by Bale - it looked like that opener just wasn't going to come!

How is it not 1-0? Benzema is fed by Bale and his first time shot is heading for the corner until it's knocked out for a corner by a none-the-wiser defender.

This time it's Gareth Bale...brilliant snapshot as he brings the ball out of his feet and Deportivo keeper Fabricio can only hit his effort on to the crossbar. Pressure building for Real.

He was hitting the bar at his birthday party last week, now he's hitting the bar at the Bernabeu.

Moments after firing a bicycle kick over he smashes the woodwork after getting on the end of Marcelo's pass. Madrid look to have woken up.

The European champions are on the ropes here - it's all Deportivo. Former Wigan man Oriol Riera the latest to have a shot at Casillas' goal, but his effort flies over.

We're underway and Deportivo are almost ahead already!

A brilliant move down the right gives Real Madrid all sorts of trouble and Casillas has to get down at his near post to save from former Barcelona man Isaac Cuenca.

It's been an unusually tough week for the Real Madrid stars. That difficult defeat down the road at the Calderon put huge pressure on the squad - who then went on to party the night away at Cristiano Ronaldo's birthday bash....perhaps not the wisest move.

Today should be a slightly easier task though against a 12th-placed Deportivo side. Can the front three of Ronaldo, Benzema and Bale turn things around?

The teams are out with less than 45 minutes to go until kick off at the Bernabeu as Real Madrid look to get back to winning ways after that embarrassing 4-0 defeat to local rivals Atletico.

Real Madrid: Casillas, Varane, Ronaldo, Kroos, Benzema, Bale, Marcelo, Arbeloa, Nacho, Isco, Illarra.

Deportivo: Fabricio, Laure, Pablo, Lopo, Luisinho, Alex Bergantinos, Borges, Cuenca, Lucas, Cavaleiro, Riera.
