Saved: Postman Mick Leak was set to be reassigned from his route in the Dorset village of Chetnole

A band of villagers who clubbed together to save their postman have won a victory over the Royal Mail by forcing the organisation to back down on the decision to change his route.

Mick Leak has delivered the post in the village of Chetnole, Dorset for 24 years - but last month he was told that the community would be taken over by a senior colleague.

Locals launched a petition and turned the village hall into a campaign headquarters, leading to a Royal Mail U-turn as the other postman agreed to pull out and allow Mr Leak to keep his route.

However, in the wake of the campaign the villagers - many of them pensioners - have been accused of intimidating the senior postman into changing his mind.

A trade union said the people of Chetnole were 'disgraceful' for lobbying to keep their postman, even though they pointed out that they had never even met his replacement and had not made contact with him.

Chetnole has been part of Mr Leak's daily rounds since the early 1990s, and he is relied upon to 'keep an eye open' for vulnerable residents, according to villagers.

As part of the Royal Mail modernisation programme, bosses announced that some routes - including Mr Leak's - would be merged with one another.

A colleague was offered the new merged route - because he had been working as a postman for three months longer than Mr Leak.

When residents of Chetnole heard about the proposed change they were quick to mobilise, launching a petition which was signed by half the village within just a few hours.

They also put up banners saying 'Royal Mail - taking the Mick', and after 10 days the replacement postman decided to allow Mr Leak to continue on his previous route.

Retired nurse Sue Morgan, who has lived in the village for 10 years and helped organise the campaign, said she was delighted by the success of the protest.

'It all started about 10 days ago when our postman notified a few of us that he had been asked to change his round,' she said.

'We knew that wasn't going to be good for any of us - he didn't want to leave and we didn't want to lose him. He's been the postman in the village for 24 years, that's longer than most of us have lived here.

'Mick is the most reliable person, he knows everybody in the village and he keeps an eye open for people, lets neighbours know if he sees anything out of the ordinary. We rely on him.

'We got together and decided to have a protest. Everybody signed the petition, we got 168 signatures. We wrote to our local MP and lobbied the Royal Mail to make our feelings known.

'We have no quarrel with the guy who was going to take over, we just really felt it was inappropriate to replace someone who had been with the village for so long.

'We were delighted when we heard the other guy had pulled out. Now we just hope that things will quieten down and go back to the status quo.'

Row: Union bosses accuse the villagers of 'intimidating' the proposed replacement postman

However, the Communication Workers Union blamed 'hostility' from villagers for the new postman's decision to pull out of the proposed changes.

'It's disgraceful that customers have been allowed to intimidate a postal worker out of his new delivery round,' he said.

'The changes applied in Royal Mail's Sherborne office were voted through by the staff and there were no complaints from workers about the agreed changes.

'As Royal Mail adapts to life under privatisation and with increasing competition there is huge change taking place in the business. CWU has negotiated fair and democratic approaches to change which treat staff consistently.'

Sleepy: But Chetnole has become a hotbed of activism over the Royal Mail decision

But Mrs Morgan said: 'We've had absolutely no contact with him, we don't know who he is or what round he does.

'We wouldn't want to upset anybody. We're being portrayed as an aggressive bunch but we're really not, we just got together one morning to save our postman.

'We would be appalled if we thought he was feeling in any way threatened, we just wanted to keep the man we know.' 

Chetnole has a population of 350 people with a local pub, village shop and post office, as well as a railway station where trains stop on request.

Villagers now say they will hold a celebratory coffee morning to honour Mr Leak after their victorious campaign.
