Banksy has put down his spray cans and finished his month-long 'residency' in New York.

The self-imposed stay was capped off with a massive charity donation and two would-be thieves were arrested.

The painting that Banksy added a Nazi officer to fetched $615,000 in an online auction and two men were hoping to make a similar windfall.

By the time that fans had gathered by the seemingly abandoned building in Queens where Banksy attached an inflatable balloon in the shape of his name, there were two men who had gotten a ladder and were in the process of cutting it down.

Final piece: Banky's last work during his 'New York residency' came in the form of an eponymous balloon

Gone: Hours after it was announced, two would-be thieves got up on the platform and tried to run off with it

Local business owners and fans called police and helped apprehend the men as they were trying to stuff the balloon in their getaway car.

A struggle ensued, but police were eventually able to get the balloon from the men and arrested them for criminal trespassing.

Another man was arrested in the struggle and faces an additional charge of criminal mischief.

Police would not reveal who were the ones who had tried to steal the ladder and who was just involved in the struggle with police and the would-be thief’s.

Master plan: The men didn't account for a crowd of fans to be on the scene as they cut down the inflatable and tried to hoist it down into an awaiting truck

Stealing the illegal: A struggle ensued between the thieves, fans and police

Caught: The two men were arrested and charged with criminal trespassing and another man was also charged

Carting it off: Police ended up being the ones to take the inflatable back with them

The police department only revealed the names of the three individuals who were arrested, with 25-year-old David Agiular and 24-year-old Ronald Galarza facing criminal trespassing charges while 31-year-old Jimmy Chiang facing an additional charge of criminal mischief.

One of the culprits spoke to a reporter from Connecticut's Fox affiliate as he was being taken into police custody, saying that he wanted to 'take it home, put it up'.

When asked where he would put it up, the would-be thief gave an unlikely answer: 'in a museum or something'.

The more likely answer would be to sell the street art.

Banksy bought this painting from a charity shop and then added the Nazi officer and signed his signature below that of the original artist, and it eventually sold for $615,000

Drawing a crowd: Throughout the day on Tuesday, spectators began to realize that the picture hanging in the charity shop window was actually made by the famed graffiti artist

The elusive artist took a painting from a charity shop and added a seated Nazi officer before returning it to the same shop and allowing them to auction it off for a six-figure sum.

HousingWorks, a New York-based charity that helps the homeless and those living with HIV/Aids, sold the painting through an online auction house and after two days of open bidding, the final price came to $615,000.

'It’s such a great gesture, what he did today is really special. He may be controversial,  but there is no controversy in the fact that it goes to something good,' the charity's spokeswoman Rebecca Edmondson said at the time.
