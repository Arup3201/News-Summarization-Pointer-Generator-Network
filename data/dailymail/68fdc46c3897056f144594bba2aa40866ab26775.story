Sharp drop: Tony Abbott is down four points as the preferred Prime Minister

Mr Abbott is now behind Bill Shorten (left) as preferred Prime Minister, 37 per cent to the Opposition Leader's 41 per cent

Only 38 per cent of voters in Mr Abbott's home state of NSW preferring him in the top job, compared to 42 per cent who say they'd back Opposition Leader Bill Shorten.

The results come three days after Mr Abbott landed himself in hot water after he said Australia was unsettled before British colonisation.

Mr Abbott made the comments during an address he made at the Melbourne Institute, saying Australia was unimaginable without foreign investment.

'I guess our country owes its existence to a form of foreign investment by the British government in the then unsettled or, um, scarcely settled, Great South Land,' he said on Friday.
