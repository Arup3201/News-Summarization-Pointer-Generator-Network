Traditional Boxing Day sales could become extinct following a rise in pre-Christmas discounts, experts said.

With shops starting their sales earlier every year, the British retail ritual on December 26 is coming to 'the end of its life cycle'.

Footfall on Boxing Day fell by four per cent between 2011 and 2013 as people found themselves shopped out by the time the customary sales began.

Retail analyst Springboard said there has been a huge shift in shopping patterns, with many people snapping up discount electrical items and clothing throughout December instead.

The growing success of US imports such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday could further diminish the popularity of this year's Boxing Day sales.

The demise of the Boxing Day stampede began during the recession, as shoppers spent less or delayed buying expensive items until the sales started.

This prompted retailers to bring their sales forward to encourage spending and, ever since, shops have competed to be the first shop to drop its prices.

Three-quarters of the top 100 high street shops have already started their sales in a bid to attract customers, with discounts averaging 45 per cent, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.

Marks & Spencer is already offering 30 per cent off knitwear, 20 per cent off bags and 20 per cent off hats, scarves and gloves, while Debenhams is offering up to half price off everything from boots and coats to dinnerware and watches.

John Lewis, Ted Baker and Next appeared to be some of the few stores holding their nerve until after Christmas.

Diane Wehrle, at Springboard, said: 'The special nature of Boxing Day is diminishing. It is possibly coming to the end of its life cycle.

'Culturally in Britain, Boxing Day is still a day when people shop, while Black Friday is a relatively new import from the US.

'But Boxing Day is no longer what it used to be, partly because the sales are starting before Christmas, so there is less impetus to rush out to the shops after Christmas, and partly because of the growth of online shopping.'

She said high street retailers needed to adapt and give families a reason to venture out on Boxing Day, including putting on entertainment.

She said: 'They need to make it an event again so that people want to go to 'experience' the sales.

'They could have entertainers or demonstrations or celebrities to attract people in.'

The mad scramble for cut-price goods on Boxing Day, such as this scene in Selfridges, could become extinct 

Only a few years ago, pre-Christmas sales were rare, with retailers able to charge full price for festive outfits and gifts

The rise in online shopping also means that many people spend their Christmas money and gift vouchers on December 25 itself, using their phones and computer tablets to do so.

Amazon has predicted this will be its busiest Christmas on record, with sales peaking at 12.26pm and again at 9.02pm, as families download films, music and books on their Kindles and tablets.

This new trend also eats into Boxing Day revenues, with many consumers felling they have 'spent up' by the time they fall asleep in Christmas Day.

Only a few years ago, pre-Christmas sales were rare, with retailers able to charge full price for festive outfits and gifts.

But retailers were forced to slash their prices in the aftermath of the economic crisis to lure shoppers back on to the High Street. Now, customers expect these sales every December.

Accounting company BDO claims that 'consumers have become conditioned towards waiting for promotions before making purchases'.

Millions of Britons will hit the high street on Tuesday in a last-minute rush, on what is expected to be the busiest shopping day of the year

The busiest hour on Tuesday will apparently fall between 1pm and 2pm, with an estimated £1.3bn set to be spent using its cards on the high street

The December sales have also encouraged people to put off their Christmas shopping, rather than stockpiling in November.

It means millions of Britons will hit the high street on Tuesday in a last-minute rush, on what is expected to be the busiest shopping day of the year.

The busiest hour will apparently fall between 1pm and 2pm, according to credit card provider Visa, with an estimated £1.3bn set to be spent using its cards on the high street.

For those wishing to avoid the crowds, brave shoppers could delay until the quietest hour of the week on the high street – 3pm on Christmas Eve.

While expensive iPads, Kindles and games consoles have featured among the best-selling items this year, traditional wooden toys and games have also made a comeback.

John Lewis said sales of backgammon boards were up 100 per cent on the same week last year, while its £100 doll's house has completely sold out.

Waitrose also reported a 'real trend for nostalgia' as sales of frozen puddings rose by almost two-thirds.

A frozen pudding by Michelin-starred chef Heston Blumenthal, called the Ultimate Chocolate Bar, is among the supermarket's bestsellers.

Based on one of Blumenthal's childhood favourites, it contains caramel mousse, an almond and hazelnut mousse, crunchy chocolate biscuit and a caramel ganache.

Meanwhile, Asda said it has also seen a big rise in venison sales, while Waitrose also has a large selection of venison steaks, pates and sausages this Christmas.

Omnivorous Britons will reportedly eat seven different types of meat over the festive season.
