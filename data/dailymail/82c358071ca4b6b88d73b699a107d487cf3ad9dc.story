Working-class people are much less likely to be openly gay than middle-class professionals, new research has revealed.

Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows large differences in the percentage of people identifying themselves as gay in different economic classes.

Those in managerial or professional roles are 60 per cent more likely to describe themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual compared to those in traditionally working-class jobs, a study found.

The ONS's Integrated Household Survey found that, overall, 1.6 per cent of people in the UK said they were gay, but pollsters believe the figure is likely to be higher as many people refused to reveal their sexuality.

More than two per cent of those in middle class positions said they were gay, lesbian or bisexual, compared to 1.4 per cent in manual labour jobs.

The survey also showed large differences between Britain's regions, with just 1.1 per cent of people in the North East describing themselves as gay, compared to 3.2 per cent in London.

After the capital, the North West had the second highest rate of people describing themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual, followed by the South West. 

Older people were less likely to be openly gay, while nearly three per cent of 16 to 24 year olds identified themselves as lesbian, gay or bisexual, the study showed.

The percentage of men who described themselves as gay was double that of women who said they are lesbian. 

James Taylor, from gay rights charity Stonewall, said: 'While these statistics should be taken with a pinch of salt, as the ONS survey still fails to represent the full picture of modern Britain, it clearly demonstrates that there are many workplaces where lesbian, gay and bisexual people don’t feel able to be themselves.'

He said the regional differences could be explained by people feeling less confident being open about their sexuality in rural areas with smaller gay communities.

Stonewall say the figures may be unreliable due to those answering the survey being unwilling to reveal their or their housemates sexuality to those asking the questions.
