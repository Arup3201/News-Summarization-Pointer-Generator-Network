Giant Jack the moose stands six feet tall, weighs almost 1,000lbs and is very protective of his tiny best friend Vanessa Gibson.

The 23-year-old has nurtured Jack since he was three days old and the enormous Alaskan moose is fiercely protective of her.

Playing tag and run, and taking walks
around the beautiful grounds of the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Centre
in Portage, Vanessa and three year old Jack are inseparable.

Long-lasting friendship: The 23-year-old has nurtured Jack since he was three days old and the enormous Alaskan moose is fiercely protective of his 'mum'

First encounter: Spending her summers away from university helping out as an intern at the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Centre, she first met Jack as a badly injured infant in 2008

Chilling out: Gentle giant Jack doesn't let other people talk to Miss Gibson when he is around, preferring to keep her all to himself

Miss Gibson even had to put up with Jack's jealousy over her boyfriend who she brought to visit him one summer.

'This past summer, my boyfriend of two and a half years came to visit me at the centre,' said  Miss Gibson.

'I went in to feed Jack, who usually is right over my shoulder as I pour the grain in the trough.

'I looked over and he's standing at the fence, staring at Michael my boyfriend, neither of them moving.

'Now,
he was not aggressive in any way and I didn't feel threatened, but Jack
wouldn't let me out of the way to see my boyfriend.

'It was a pretty funny situation, I was held captive while my moose took care of any danger! He's sweet.'

Gentle giant Jack doesn't let other people talk to Vanessa when he is around, preferring to keep her all to himself.

'Many people do not understand my relationship with him. I want everyone to know that my relationship with Jack is very special and extremely unique,' said Miss Gibson.

'I truly respect Jack's power and strength, and trust my intuition.

'If something does not feel right and I feel like I should leave, I do. 

'Jack was just little when he came to the centre. I never left his side, and he needed constant care.

'Because of our continuous interaction as he grew up, Jack and I have formed a lasting friendship and a lifelong bond.

'He's a good boy and reacts to my emotions. He knows when I have a bad day and always does something to cheer me up.'

Spending
her summers away from university helping out as an intern at the Alaska
Wildlife Conservation Centre,  Miss Gibson first met Jack as a badly injured
infant in 2008.

'When I
first met Jack, he was about 25 lbs, three days old, had a gnarly bite 
mark on his right hip, and a complete fracture above his right front 
knee.

'I was told he 
had a 20% chance of surviving. He was laying in my lap with his head on 
my chest. I was attached to him the moment I first saw him.

'His mother had abandoned him, but I wouldn't.

Best friends: Many people do not understand my relationship with him. I want everyone to know that my relationship with Jack is very special and extremely unique,' said Miss Gibson

Spending a sleepless night with the young moose in a barn on the property,  Miss Gibson fed helpless Jack every fours hours with milk formula.

'As Jack began to get stronger and healthier, he started to try new things,' said  Miss Gibson.

'As I grew attached to him, he also grew attached to me and never wanted me to leave.

'As I closed the door of the barn one afternoon after his feeding to begin to walk back to work, I heard him cry at the door and kick it with his hooves.'

Vanessa learned to re-apply the cast to Jack's leg by the centre's visiting vet.

'I spent every night of that summer with Jack tending to his needs and his leg,' said  Miss Gibson.

'When he was ready to be moved from the barn to larger cabin, I put up a tent outside to be near him, but he always slept outside my tent anyway.

'When it became time for Jack's cast to be removed, he had to figure out how to walk on this leg and limped everywhere he went...except when he ran, which I didn't understand.'

Returning to university in September,  Miss Gibson would spend the entire term time thinking about Jack.

'I miss Jack terribly in the winter. Every part of me wants to run back to Alaska so I can see him! ' said Vanessa.

'For the past three summers when I go to see him, I stand at the fence and call his name.

'I am at the centre from May to August of each year but after nine months of being gone, it shocks me how much he remembers my voice.

'When I open the gate, he can't get to me fast enough and rubs his face all over me!

Describing Jack as 'hooves down my best friend',  Miss Gibson adores the time she spends with him and the special bond they have.

'Jack has never made me feel threatened or scared in anyway.'
