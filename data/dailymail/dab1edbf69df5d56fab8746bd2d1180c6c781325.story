Drugs used to treat high blood pressure and chest pain are often prescribed with simvastatin, but there are fears the combination can cause unpleasant side effects

Thousands of people taking a common statin are to have their dose reduced due to fears over side effects.

The medicines regulator has warned that patients taking one particular type - simvastatin - at the same time as other drugs used to reduce high blood pressure are likely to suffer more muscle aches and pains.

And for the first time, it has produced a patient leaflet to inform people of the changes being made.

Statins have been hailed as a wonderdrug which can slash cholesterol and protect against a host of chronic illnesses.

But the MHRA is concerned that some people taking other drugs with them could suffer painful muscle problems, lung disorders and kidney damage.

Every day eight million people in the UK take various statins, which cost as little as 40p a day.

Simvastatin is the most frequently prescribed one; last year GPs gave out almost three million prescriptions for it in England alone.

But studies have shown that patients taking simvastatin, particularly the 40mg dose which is the most commonly prescribed in England, suffered more problems if they were also on amlodipine and diltiazem.

These are used to treat high blood pressure and chest pain associated with heart disease and they are often prescribed with simvastatin.

The side effects are those usually associated with statins, including muscle problems such as pain, tenderness, weakness and cramps and more rarely muscle breakdown leading to kidney damage.

These occurred more frequently when patients were on both drugs at the same time.

The general advice from the MHRA is 
that patients should not stop taking simvastatin. However, if they 
experience any muscle pain, weakness or cramps whilst taking 
simvastatin, they should stop taking it and see their doctor as soon as 
possible.

Doctors may lower the simvastatin 
dose as the side effects were less common when patients were on a 20mg 
dose, or switch them to another statin.

Despite advocates saying that everyone over 50 should be statins, the side effects are well-documented.

Simvastatin is the most frequently prescribed statin in the UK, with GPs writing nearly three million prescriptions for it in England alone last year

Some taking the drugs suffer mild side-effects such as insomnia and stomach upsets, but others complain of agonising muscle pain and there have been reports about patients developing a rare but serious lung disorder.

However most experts still agree that the benefits of taking them far outweigh any risks.

Patients are being advised that if 
they are taking simvastatin alongside either of the other two 
medications their doctor may review their treatment at the next routine 
appointment.

An MHRA spokesman said: 'The MHRA is committed to public health and continuously monitors the safety of all medicines.

'We have recently published 
information on dosing recommendations for simvastatin which were updated
due to a small risk of an increase in side effects when it is used at 
higher doses in conjunction with amlodipine or diltiazem.

'This advice is intended to optimise 
the proven beneficial effects of statins while minimising any adverse 
effects and should not be a reason for stopping statin treatment. We 
have advised that patients continue their treatment and discuss this 
with their doctor at their next routine appointment.

'The updated information has been 
highlighted in our first Drug Safety Update article designed exclusively
for patients, with the aim that people taking these medicines can 
understand why their statin treatment may have changed.'

Judy O’Sullivan, Senior Cardiac Nurse
at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘This is not based on any new 
revelations about unknown side effects of simvastatin. 

‘We know that side effects with this 
drug are dose related – the higher the dose, the greater the risk of 
developing muscle pain. Because calcium channel blockers slow down the 
rate at which simvastatin is broken down, the drug levels in the blood 
stream can be higher. 

‘Therefore patients taking both 
simvastatin and a calcium channel blocker should discuss their dose with
their GP at their next visit or when their prescription is due for 
renewal. There are alternative statins available for prescription.'
