Marcelo Lippi, the former Italy manager, sensationally stormed onto the pitch on Wednesday after seeing two of his Guangzhou Evergrande players sent off in their 1-0 first leg loss away to Western Sydney Wanderers in the Asian Champions League quarter-final.

The 2006 World Cup winning coach ran onto the Sydney pitch before the final whistle to berate the Emirati referee Mohammed Abdulla Hassan Mohamed after Gao Lin and  Zhang Linpeng were  shown straight red card cards in the dying minutes.

Lippi was enraged by the decisions and after confronting the referee, his anger got worse as he stormed out of the post-match press conference.

'The first one I didn't see very well but the second one was right in front of me and was not a red card,' he said through a translator. 

'You know me from the World Cup and the Champions League, I am not like this, I am an educated man. I know I shouldn't go on the pitch but I just wanted to ask him to explain his decision.

'I didn't want to talk about winning the World Cup or anything, I just wanted to ask him for an explanation,'

Lippi was so incensed by the decisions and not being able to see the referee after the match that he ended his press conference stood up and shouting in Italian, with neither his English nor Mandarin translator able to keep up.

The Wanderers manager, former Crystal Palace defender Tony Popovic  had no sympathy for Lippi and said: 'I don't know what he's so upset about. We all disagree with decisions but we do it from the touchline. But you can't have coaches going on the pitch and manhandling players.'

Chaos: Lippi heads towards the referee as the match descended into farce in the closing stages 

Hold me back: Lippi's management team did their best to restrain the Italian but to no avail

Back off: Referee Mohammed Abdulla Hassan Mohamed looked intimidated by the former Italy boss
