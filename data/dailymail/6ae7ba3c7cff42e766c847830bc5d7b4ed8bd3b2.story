The Prime Minister's chief of staff being married to the Liberal Party director has been labelled as a conflict of the interest and the cause for in-house fighting between its members.

In two explosive emails sent to the party's 27-member federal party executive and Tony Abbott on Sunday night, the party's Federal treasurer Phil Higginson expressed his outrage about Peta Credlin and her husband Brian Loughnane being placed in such influential roles describing it as the 'most serious current dilemma' within the Liberal party. 

In his unashamed rant, Mr Higginson said he could not understand 'how this party ever let a husband and wife team into those roles' adding that it would never be allowed in the corporate world. 

'A managing director would never allow his executive assistant to be the wife of the chairman,' he wrote.

Mr Higginson went on to say that the people responsible for the decision to allow Credlin and Loughnane to take on the powerful positions should 'hang their collective heads in shame'.

The honourary treasurer said he found it a 'complete mystery' as to how the husband and wife duo were selected for the influential jobs which required 'competitive tension' and confidential discussions with both sides of the Liberal party 

'I am overwhelmed daily by the sheer vitriol and pent-up animosities and enmities that exist. 

'I haven't worked pro bono for over four years in this role and over 10 years for my good friend (Mr Abbott) to see him brought down this way,' the email was reported as saying in The Herald Sun.

Mr Higginson went on to say that if the situation wasn't so serious that he would find it 'almost amusing' while calling on the party to take immediate action.

'It immediately brings about the cessation of open communications to the federal director, contributes to wooden and unreliable communication and a reluctance towards open and trusting lines of communication, and, dare I say it, retribution,' the leaked email said.

Mr Higginson also claimed that he had only signed off on the party's 2013/14 accounts in the past week due to a 'significant delay' in the information about expenses that he requested from Mr Loughnane and the party's secretariat, Fairfax media reported.

He also highlighted concerns over financial reporting standards within the party, and said he would stand down from the treasurer's role before June.
