A summer camp counselor taunted a former camper with horrifying messages, including threats to rape him, for nearly a year over the anonymous messaging app Kik, police say.

Robert Yagid, 18, turned himself into a police on Thursday after authorities finally tracked the messages pack to his cell phone, according to authorities. 

Among the terrifying messages that Yagid allegedly to sent to the 13-year-old boy were 'you're so cute when you sleep,' and 'I'm coming for your tight little a**,' the South Florida Sun-Sentinel reports. 

Camp counselor: Robert Yagid, a camp counselor at Tree Tops Park in Davie, California is accused of anonymously sending one of his male 13-year-old campers and a 12-year-old threatening messages on Kik

When detectives seized his hard drives, they discovered a slew of websites in his browsing history that he had allegedly been using as source material - including 'Stalking for Beginners,' 'How to Ruin Someone’s Life,' and 'Pedophile's Guide.' 

After police identified Yagid as the alleged cyberbully, the 13-year-old identified the young man as his camp from Tree Tops Park in Davie, Florida. 

Yagid is also accused of sending inappropriate messages to a 12-year-old girl on Kik. 

According to police, some of the message that were sent are: 

'You're so cute when you sleep,' said one of the messages sent under the pseudonym Megan Hoffmin that brought the 13-year-boy and son of a Hollywood, Florida, police officer to tears. 

'For a gated community [your home] has terrible security. BTW your gate was opened, so I closed it,' said another one of the messages.

A third message read, 'Who am I? You have until July 20th to answer my question or else I'm coming for your tight little a**.'

A very long threatening message detailing a sexual assault to the boy was sent in June, according to cops.

It read, 'Have you ever been raped before? Because that tight, white little a****** belongs to me now … You can call authorities, you can pray to God, but you will never find me. Until I've found you first,' it said, according to the affidavit.

'The devil has plans for you; it looks dim and full of sickness, consuming your body. Make amends to free your heart, and soul; for soon, there will be no going back.'

When the boy's mother discovered the messages she took them to Pembroke Pines police and obtained a search warrant.

'The suspect's actions caused him to be fearful and he believed that his life was in danger,' Detective Michael Silver wrote in the search warrant application.

That day detectives used IP addresses to find suspect Yagid at his house in Davie.

After showing the boy a photo line-up he recognized the photo of Yagid to be 'Robbie' his camp counselor.

Mobile app: The threatening messages were sent via the mobile app Kik under the name Megan Hoffmin

Cops say they confiscated Yagid's electronic devices and found a Google history that read, 'The Creepy Sex Manifesto,' 'Stalking for Beginners,' 'How to Ruin Someone’s Life,' and 'Paedophiles Guide,' according to a juvenile arrest affidavit.

The Sun Sentinel reports that Yagid was not arrested and that the case is being investigated as cyber stalking.

The text messages to the 12-year-old girl, a friend of the boy he targeted, asked how far she'd gone sexually with the boy.

Yagid allegedly then texted, 'You're the luckiest girl in the world. I'd give anything and everything to be [the boy's] girlfriend,' along with a sad face emoticon.

When police questioned Yagid as to why he wrote the messages he wrote that he was, 'just bored.' 

'We have no comment,'  Yagid's father told The Sun Sentinel.

'We have a lot of confidence in the legal system, and we'll leave it at that.'

Scott Avras, a representative from the summer camp where Yagid worked said,'I'm in shock.' 

'He's a very nice young man. Robbie has always been a very hard worker here,' said Avras,
