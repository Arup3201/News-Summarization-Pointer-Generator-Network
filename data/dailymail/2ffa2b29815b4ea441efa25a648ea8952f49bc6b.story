Dr Nurpur Mittal, arriving for sentencing at Canterbury Crown Court yesterday, after being convicted of stealing money from a patient's handbag

A GP who stole money from a mother’s purse during an appointment for her sick baby was fined £5,000 yesterday and now faces being struck off.

Dr Nurpur Mittal, 33, took £130 cash from Kelly Wissenden’s purse after the mother-of-two left the consultation room to obtain a specimen from her nine-month-old son Zaio Headley.

Miss Wissenden, 29, said she thought it was ‘odd’ when she returned and saw Dr Mittal ‘fiddling around’ in her bag, which she had left on her child’s buggy in the doctor’s room.

But she only realised the money was missing when she checked the purse as she left White Cliffs Medical Centre in Dover, Kent.

It emerged in court that Dr Mittal had previously been given a ‘fiscal warning’ for shoplifting in Scotland. She now faces the possibility of being struck off the medical register as she will be ordered to appear before a General Medical Council disciplinary board.

And she was warned yesterday by Judge James O’Mahony at Canterbury Crown Court that she will be sent to jail if she doesn’t pay the fine within six months.

Dr Mittal, from Shepherdswell, near Dover, was convicted of theft by a jury last month.

Judge O’Mahony told her: ‘This is a sad state of affairs.

‘A patient has the right to expect that the last person in the world who would steal from them was  a doctor.’

The court heard that Miss Wissenden was intending to use the money to pay for repairs to her car.

Andrew Forsyth, prosecuting, said: 'Miss Wissenden later described seeing Dr Mittal fiddling around near the change bag and the buggy, looking very flustered.

'She thought it strange at the time but didn't say anything.'

After checking her bag outside and finding the money had gone missing, she returned inside the surgery and told the receptionist Christine Button about her cash disappearing from her purse.

She said they searched the doctor's room and the changing area where they had taken her son but did not find anything.

However, after following Dr Mittal's advice, they returned a short while later and found the cash on the floor of the changing room.

Miss Wissenden phoned the police later that day to report the doctor and what had happened.

The court was told Dr Mittal phoned Miss Wissenden later that evening asking her to withdraw the theft allegation.

Dr Mittal, from Shepherdswell, near Dover, was convicted of theft by a jury last month after she had denied the charge.

Before sentencing Dr Mittal, he asked for a report about her mental state as he could not understand why someone who 'probably receives a healthy salary' would want to steal £130.

The theft took place at White Cliff's Medical Centre in Dover, pictured, and Dr Mittal's name has been removed from the website as a list of doctors practicing at the centre

The court also heard yesterday that Dr Mittal was married but her husband is filing for divorce from her.

Her name has been taken off the website list of doctors practising at the White Cliffs Medical Centre in Dover.

Yesterday the practice manager at the medical centre said they did not want to comment.

After the court hearing, Miss Wissenden, who works as a stewardess for P&O Ferries, said: 'It's really shocking, it's horrible.

'I put my faith in her, my son's life was in her hands and she stole from me.

'It's been such a stressful time. The reaction you get when you tell people is 'really, but she's a doctor?'.

'The barrister even told me to expect a not guilty verdict because the jury was more likely to believe a doctor over me.'
