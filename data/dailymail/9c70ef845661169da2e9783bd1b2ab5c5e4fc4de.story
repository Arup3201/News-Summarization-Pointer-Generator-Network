The World Cup is approaching and excitement is building at 100 mph, but that's nothing compared to the top speed of these stars' motors.

Whether going for the class of a Maybach, or the speed of a Ferrari, these stars have the money and fuel to burn. One footballing petrolhead even has a £4million colleciton. Check out the expensive engines below.

Cristiano Ronaldo – Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4

Officially recognised as the best player in the world, Ronaldo’s car exudes the same type of panache the Real Madrid man does with the ball. The Lamborghini Aventador is not a shy car with a lofty 700 brake horsepower (BHP) to help the vehicle reach a top speed of 217mph.

The Ballon d’Or winner’s car comes in a stealthy matte black to add that extra touch of understated style. However all this flash will set you back a hefty £267,000.

Power: Cristiano Ronaldo won the Balon d'Or for his performances for Real Madrid and Portugal

Top speed: Ronaldo taking a drive with his son in a Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4

Lionel Messi – Maserati GranTurismo MC Stradale

A car befitting of a player held in the same regard as the greatest of all time. When needing to get from A to B, Messi uses a his Maserati GranTurismo MC Stradale.

His vehicle comes in a clean looking white, reaches a top speed of 188mph and costs upwards of £107,000. Certainly a worthy drive for the only man who can stand toe-to-toe with Ronaldo in world football.

Wayne Rooney – Aston Martin Vanquish

For the talismanic Englishman it is fitting to choose a car that is British. The Aston Martin Vanquish is a car which expresses the same class on the road that Rooney does on the field.

It set Rooney back £166,000, but with a top speed of 183mph and a booming engine of 565 BHP it is most certainly a car for a superstar.

Samuel Eto’o – Maybach 57 S Xanatec Coupe

At one time Eto’o was the highest paid player in the world. He is said to have a fleet of cars costing an astonishing £3.98million. Of his collection the car that stands out is his Maybach Xanantec Coupe. It costs £600,000 and has a huge presence on the road, similar to that of the Cameroonian captain’s on the pitch.

He has also been seen driving around the streets of Knightbridge in his Aston Martin One-77.

Mario Balotelli - Ferrari F12

Super Mario is not known for being sky, and this Ferrari 12 is a perfect match to the Italian's fiery personality. In Milan red, the former Man City star has made a change from his Bentley Continental Supersports in camouflage, which he used to roam the streets of Manchester during his time in England.

Here he is, giving it a good hose down. Boys and their toys at the highest level.

Neymar – Audi R8 GT

The man with the weight of a nation on his shoulders and the face of the Brazil World Cup. The talented forward chooses to cruise the roads in the Audi R8 GT. Costing nearly £148,000, it reaches top speeds of nearly 200mph.

Neymar has decided to keep the design simple and sleek in a bright white paint job and a classical red leather upholstery interior.

Ribery – Lamborghini Gallardo LP560-4 Spyder

Ribery, referred to as ‘the jewel of French football’ by the legendary Zinedine Zidane, will miss out on being the focal point of France’s bid for World Cup glory after picking up an injury.

But Ribery can take comfort on the road with his Gallardo LP560-4 Spyder. Able to reach 201mph and costing £133,000, his ride comes in an eye catching bright green so he is never out of the spotlight.
