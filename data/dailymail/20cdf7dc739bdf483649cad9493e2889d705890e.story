A couple on a romantic stroll were left shocked after they stumbled upon an outdoor cannabis farm in an area of suburban woodland.

Oscar Lerin, 35, was out for a walk with his girlfriend in Epping Forest when he strayed a few metres off the path in search of mushrooms.

The couple couldn't believe their eyes when they found themselves surrounded by around 70 professionally-cultivated adult marijuana plants.

Oscar Lerin and his girlfriend were walking in Epping Forest north of London when they stumbled upon up to 70 cannabis plants growing not far from a busy path

The couple made the discovery on Saturday morning in a patch of woodland close to a school in Woodford Green, Essex.

Mr Lerin and his girlfriend, who has asked not to be named, took photographs crouched among the strong-smelling leaves before continuing with their walk.

Mr Lerin, from Essex, said: 'It was funny. We couldn't believe it. We were like "really? Is this real?" We never expected to see something like that in a public forest.

'We like nature and we went to Epping Forest to have a walk and have a look at mushrooms and identify them. 

'We were just walking and walking and I looked around and I thought this looks like a marijuana plantation.'

Mr Lerin added: 'The smell was really strong so I knew it could be nothing else. It was very close to the path, behind a big bush.

'I think there was around 60 or 70 plants and it covered quite a large area - about 15 or 20 square metres.

'The soil was different. We had a look and there was a sheet of plastic on the ground and the different soil was on top and the plants were in there.'

The park is a former royal forest on the border between north-east Greater London and Essex and managed by City of London Corporation.

A spokeswoman for the government body said: 'We can't comment at the moment as it is a police matter.'

Police are investigating the find in a park which is popular with local residents in north London and Essex
