Parking wardens could be dishing out higher fines after Transport Secretary Norman Baker said the current price may not be enough of a 'deterrent'

Parking fines could rise by as much as £50 because the current cap on charges may not act as enough as a 'deterrent' for drivers.

Currently, motorists outside London pay a maximum of £70 for a parking fine but Transport Secretary Norman Baker said this is under review.

It means drivers could be forced to pay as much as £130 for a parking ticket - if the London charge cap is introduced around the country.

Mr Baker confirmed to MPs at the transport select committee meeting yesterday that a review on fines is underway - the first on charges outside of London since 2001.

He said Londoners have faced escalating fines after both Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnston increased the cap.

However, fines outside the capital have remained static.

The Lewes MP said: 'It can be argued that if the cost of legitimate parking rises to such a degree that the penalty no longer becomes a deterrent then that should be looked at', he was quoted in The Telegraph as saying.

The review has been criticised by motorist groups.

Edmund King, President of the AA, told The Telegraph: 'Our concern would be that local authorities become reliant on the fines as income'.

He added there was a danger local authorities use parking fines as a source of revenue rather than a measure to prevent illegal parking.

Mr Baker admitted that any rise would prove unpopular with drivers, who are already being squeezed at the pumps.

Mr Baker admitted increasing the fines may 'send out the wrong message'

He told MPs that rises may hit struggling town centres hard and 'send out the wrong message' to motorists.

However, Mr Baker refused to tell the committee what decision he is likely to make.

The British Parking Association supports councils who want to increase penalty charges.

The association said in its 2013 parking masterplan that it wants fines to be reviewed at least every four years.

It says on its website more frequent reviews are needed 'to ensure they remain effective and fit for purpose and that charges are set locally'.

The association said: 'There is an urgent need to change these penalty charges since they often fail to act as a deter rent and sometimes encourage non-compliance with traffic management and parking rules.

'This is costly and unfair on council tax payers who will be subsidising parking enforcement and undermines effectiveness of local transport policies.'
