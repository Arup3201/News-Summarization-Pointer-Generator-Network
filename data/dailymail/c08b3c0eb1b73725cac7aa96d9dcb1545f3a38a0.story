Dallas Archer, 19, who smuggled a gun into a Tennessee prison in her genitals

A teenage girl tried to smuggle a loaded handgun into prison by hiding it in her genitals.

Dallas Archer, 19, from Tennessee was taken to Kingsport jail by police after being arrested for driving with a suspended license.

As she was searched before entering the facility, a female prison officer was alerted to an 'unknown object' in her crotch.

After further examination, it was discovered she had concealed a loaded North American Arms 22 LR revolver in her genitals, according to a police report.

A subsequent check showed that four-inch weapon, valued at $250 had been stolen in 2013.

It previously belonged to 70-year-old retired car saleman, John Souther, who had it taken from his car, which was broken in to while parked at Kingsport carport.

When told where the gun had been hidden, Mr Southern said he would eventually like the weapon back but it would require a 'bath in bleach', according to the website Smoking Gun.

Archer was charged with gun possession and trying to introduce contraband into a penal facility.

It is thought she was released from custody after posting a $6,000 bound.
