How do you make sure people pick up their dog’s mess?

That’s something researchers have been trying to figure out.

But, in tackling this problem, they reveal some startling figures for the state of dog mess in the UK.

Toilet trained: New research suggests that a small minority of dog walkers are not pulling their weight when it comes to cleaning up their dog's poo, leading to a problem with no clear solution

The study, led by Professor Christopher Lowe at the University of Central Lancashire, ‘sought to investigate the behaviour and attitudes of dog walkers to picking up and disposing of dog foul.'

‘Dog waste audits were conducted on popular dog walking paths in Lancashire,’ they wrote.

In the research they surveyed 933 people. They found that most dog walkers do actually claim to clean up after their dogs.

In fact, only three per cent were adamant they would not pick up their dog’s poo, while just eight per cent said they would only pick it up if it was on a path.

Recent research suggests what dog owners knew all along – that they do in fact experience feelings of love and affection.

Scientists
 at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, discovered that a part of the 
brain associated with positive emotions, is similar in dogs and humans.

They too used fMRI scanners to examine canine brain activity.

Using
 hand signals to indicate the dogs were about to receive a food treat, 
the researchers showed that the caudate nucleus, a part of the brain 
associated with positive emotions, was similar in dogs and humans.

'If,
 as many scientists have argued in the past, it is all simply about [getting] food for dogs then the reaction in their brains would be the 
same no matter who or what is offering them the food,’ said 
neuroscientist Gregory Berns.

‘We
 hope to show that they love us for things far beyond food, basically 
the same things that humans love us for, like social comfort and social 
bonds.’

While a minority, however, it is this small group that ultimately causes the problem.

In the UK 1,000 tonnes of dog poo is created each day by about eight million dogs.

Even just a small percentage of this can be significant.

Abandoned dog excrement can be both harmful to humans and the environment.

Dog waste carries a large number of parasites - including hookworms, ringworms, tapeworms and Salmonella.

These parasites can cause digestive upsets, and in some cases, even blindness.

Dog waste is also full of E. Coli and other harmful bacteria including fecal coliform bacteria, which causes serious kidney disorders, intestinal illness, cramps and diarrhea in humans. 

The waste can also strain local resources when it needs to be picked up.

According to the study, £22 million ($37million) is spent per year on ‘dog waste collection’ by local agencies in England and Wales.

But the threat of fines or public campaigns doesn’t seem to have had an effect on this destabilising minority.

The researchers suggest that it may be necessary to ‘guilt’ the minority into picking up their dog’s waste in order to tackle the problem.

Ultimately, however they say a solution is still a way off.

‘It is suggested that significantly more research is required to assist in addressing this emotive yet complex problem,’ they conclude.

Are you responsible? Keeping dogs on a leash could be one solution to the problem, say the researchers, but ultimately they're not quite certain how to tackle the issue of growing canine waste in the UK

New research looked into how likely people were to pick up their dog's poo

@highlight

The study was carried out by the University of Central Lancashire

@highlight

They found that only 3% would not make any effort to pick it up

@highlight

But they say that British canines create 1,000 tonnes of waste a day

@highlight

This makes it a growing problem, but they don't know what the solution is
