As news of an engagement today circulated, a source close to Pippa Middleton says her boyfriend, banker Nico Jackson, 36, has NOT proposed.

The rumour mill went into overdrive when a US magazine reported that Jackson popped the question - and Pippa accepted - while the pair were in India at the beginning of December.

The magazine claims that the couple will walk down the aisle in 2014.

Has he? US Weekly has reported that Nico Jackson got down on one knee and asked Pippa Middleton to marry him

The pair stayed at the Oberoi Amarvilas, a five-star resort with views of the famed Taj Mahal, where a luxury suite costs £1,600 a night.

The mausoleum was built by Mughal 
emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal and is 
described as 'the jewel of Muslim art in India.'

The monument is a popular spot for engagements.

A source told US Weekly that Jackson had picked his moment carefully: 'It was exactly how he planned it - very romantic and grand!'

The same source claims Middleton, 30, and Jackson, 36, have been celebrating their happy news in private since returning from their trip.

Touch down: Pippa Middleton and her boyfriend Nico Jackson breezed through Heathrow last week as they arrived back from a trip to India, where they reportedly got engaged

Down on one knee: Nico apparently  popped the question during their early December trip to India's Oberoi Amarvilas. Here, they look loved up at Wimbledon in July this year

The
 pair arrived back from their trip to India on December 10, looking 
relaxed and tanned when they were photographed just after touching down 
at Heathrow.

Ever the gentleman, Nico steered their trolley, with its four pieces of luggage, through the airport.

At that time, there was no sign of a ring on Pippa's finger, nor has there been any official announcement since.

However, rumours of an engagement – denied by Pippa - have been circulating since September.

A friend confided to the Mail on Sunday: ‘Pippa
and Nico made a pact to travel to lots of exotic destinations before 
walking down the aisle to start a family.

'There will be lots of trips 
like this in coming months.’

Could it be her next? Pippa caught the world's attention when she served as bridesmaid for her sister, the Duchess of Cambridge in 2011

Where's the ring? At the time of landing from India, there was no sign of a ring on Pippa's finger, nor has there been any official announcement since

Pippa and Nico were first pictured together in February while on holiday 
in Mustique with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Middleton 
family.

In September, 
the couple went
on another romantic break to the Caribbean, and also jetted off for a shooting weekend in October.

Former Edinburgh University student Pippa
and Nico were seen laughing and giggling at the
check-in desk before taking a low-cost flight from Inverness to London on their way back from a shoot in the Highlands.

The duo are also big tennis fans and were regulars at Wimbledon over the summer looking very much in love as they followed the action on centre court as they held 
hands, kissed, and shared jokes between games.

She wrote in her Vanity Fair column last
month that when she was younger she told her family: 'If I had to get 
married, it would be in my tennis whites - shorts with no pleats or 
frills.'

Broker: Nico grew up in a red-brick terraced house in a middle-class family in Folkestone before making his millions as a stockbroker at Deutsche Bank

Part of the family: Pippa and Nico were first pictured together in February while on holiday in Mustique with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Middleton family

Nico grew up in a red-brick terraced 
house in a middle-class family in Folkestone before making his millions
as a stockbroker at Deutsche Bank.

Unlike
 Pippa, who attended the prestigious Marlborough College, Nico was 
educated at the local Stella Maris Catholic primary school and then The 
Harvey Grammar School in Folkestone before heading to Kingston 
University.

Pippa has previously 
dated investment banker James Matthews, 37, and financier and former 
England cricketer Alex Loudon, 32.

Is it time to celebrate? Pippa, a party planner who wrote a guide to throwing celebrations, could well be planning her own special event if the sources are to be believed

Luxurious: Ranked amongst the leading resorts in the world, The Oberoi Amarvilas are a stone's throw from the Taj Mahal in Agra

Great views: The hotel is located 600 meters from the Taj Mahal and all rooms, suites, lobby, bar and lounge offer breathtaking views of the monument, says the website

Sunset: Built in a style inspired by Moorish and Mughal architecture, the resort aims to take visitors back to an era of Emperors and Princes, says the site

Close: The Middleton sisters are famously close, so will Kate return the favour and be Pippa's bridesmaid?

The Oberoi Amarvilas is set amist an array of terraced lawns, fountains, reflection pools and pavilions

Pippa and Nico travelled in style in India, choosing to stay in one of the country's most dazzling and extravagant hotels.

The Oberoi Amarvilas is a breathtaking building - its turrets and towers are inspired by Moorish and Mughal architecture.

 amist an array of terraced lawns, fountains, pools and 
pavilion,s it is undoubtably one of the most romantic hotels in world.

 Pippa and Nico stayed in a Luxury Suite at the hotel they would have

and a spacious bedroom with a four-poster bed.

warmth to the ultra-luxe surroundings, and two private open-air terraces, both
