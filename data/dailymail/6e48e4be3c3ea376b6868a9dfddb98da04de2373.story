Having been in England for two-and-a-half years you might think that Chelsea's Brazilian midfielder Oscar had acclimatised to the Great British weather.

But the 23-year-old wasn't coping well with the conditions in Liverpool on Tuesday night as he warmed himself on the substitutes' bench with a hot-water bottle.

Oscar was left out of the first leg of Chelsea's Capital One Cup semi-final and the playmaker, who is more used to the Brazilian sunshine than the cold nights on Merseyside, took measures to beat the low temperatures.

A thick coat, a hat, gloves and a snood wasn't enough for Oscar as he took his place among the subs clasping the hot-water bottle under his arm, while holding his shin pads in his hand.

Fortunately for Oscar he didn't have to strip off after Jose Mourinho opted against bringing the Brazilian on as Chelsea earned a 1-1 draw.

Eden Hazard opened the scoring from the penalty spot but Chelsea were pegged back in the second half when Raheem Sterling levelled for Liverpool.
