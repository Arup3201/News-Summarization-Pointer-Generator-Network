South African police who gunned down 34 striking miners in the tragedy dubbed the Marikana Massacre had put in an advanced order for enough mortuary vans to carry 32 bodies, an inquiry heard.

The revelation adds weight to suggestions that officers were preparing for the worst when they confronted up to 3,000 workers near the Marikana mine in August last year.

The Marikana Commission of Inquiry, which was set up to investigate the tragedy, has heard how police had asked the health department for four mortuary vans, which were each able to carry eight bodies, to be sent to the site hours before the clashes.

A Colonel Classen, from the South African Police Service, allegedly said he was going to 'close down the miners' when he put in the order.

A
separate request for 4,000 rounds of ammunition for R5 assault rifles had
also been made, it was reported by The Financial Times.

That
afternoon, police opened fire on the miners, killing 34 and injuring 
more than 70 in one of the most shocking incidents since the end of 
white rule in 1994.

The killings, caught on camera, shocked the world and reminded many in South Africa of apartheid-era police brutality.

Taking cover: Protesting miners can be seen cowering within the gun sights of an police officer

Surrounded: Police form an armed cordon around strikers. It is unclear whether these miners are injured or lying down for officers to conduct searches

At the centre of violence: The Lonmin PLC mine, near Rustenburg, 100km north-west of Johannesburg, where around 3,000 miners walked out on August 10 over wages. Since then there have been several fatal incidents

Under pressure: President Jacob Zuma

In the days after the killings, South African prosecutors then sparked 
outrage when they charged 270 miners with
the murders of their striking colleagues at the Lonmin Platinum Mine near Rustenburg.

The
men were charged under a law dating from the apartheid era that alleges
they had a 'common purpose' in the murder of their co-workers.

The
African National Congress, whose members used to be gunned down by 
apartheid police at protest rallies and targeted with draconian laws, 
was severely criticised for using similar tactics now that it is in 
power.

Earlier this month, South African President Jacob Zuma, who set up the inquiry, gave the commission an extra six months to finalise its probe into the events that led to the massacre on August 16, 2012, including the conduct of police.

The investigating commission - led by 
appeals court judge Ian Farlam - began deliberations on October 1, and 
the inquiry was originally scheduled to finish within four months.

However,
the process has been marred by accusations of police lying about 
events, violence against witnesses and stoppages caused by a shortage of
legal fees for the miners.

Violence: A mine worker is pictured licking his spear at Lonmins Marikana platinum mine in South Africa, where police opened fire on striking miners armed with machetes and sticks

Bloody scenes: The shooting was one of the worst in South Africa since the end of the apartheid era

Sticks and stones versus bullets: Miners can be seen between police vehicles throwing rocks at officers. Victims on both sides have been killed in recent days

Gun battle: In the heat of the incident, dust flies and police take cover. Water cannon and tear gas had been fired at miners before police opened fire

The
inquiry has heard evidence that highlights not only police incompetence
but also suggests commanders may have been under political pressure to 
embark on an operation that risked many deaths.

The
inquiry was told how police fired at least 600 rounds, while just five 
9mm pistols which could only have fired a total of 24 bullets were found
the areas occupied by the strikers.

Police have argued that they acted in self-defence against protesters who charged at them with spears and machetes.

While
it is accepted they faced a volatile situation, their defence has been 
marred by claims that officers have distorted the facts - including 
comments by the commission's senior evidence leader who feared the 
police's version of events 'were in material respects not the truth'.
