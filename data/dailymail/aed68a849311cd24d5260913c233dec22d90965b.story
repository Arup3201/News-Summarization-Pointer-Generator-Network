New Jersey Governor Chris Christie laid into President Barack Obama on Tuesday night over his refusal to take responsibility for his role in the rise of the Islamic State.

Referencing the president's claim in a recent interview that the terrorist group accumulated so much territory in Syria because the American intelligence community 'underestimated' the radical militants' capabilities, Christie said he was 'disturbed' by Obama's behavior.

The Republican Governor argued that Obama shares in the blame for the  tumultuous situation in the Middle Eastern country and border state Iraq, and he should own up to his mistakes.

'It should be 'we,' Mr. President,' Christie told CNN's Dana Bash in an interview. 'It's your administration, and when you're the leader, you have to be held accountable for what they do.'

'He's the president, and he needs to be accountable, and I hope that he says that and corrects what I hope was a misstatement,' Christie continued.

Blame Game: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie chided President Barack Obama on Tuesday for refusing to admit that he, too, underestimated the Islamic State 

'He's the president, and he needs to be accountable, and I hope that he says that and corrects what I hope was a misstatement,' Christie told CNN's Dana Bash in an interview

Obama's noteworthy castigation of his intelligence team stemmed from an interview Central Intelligence Agency Director James Clapper gave to the Washington Post in mid-September.

Clapper told the Post that his agency didn't 'predict the will to fight,' or lack thereof, among Iraqi forces.

'That’s always a problem,' he said, citing the Vietnam War. 'In this case, we underestimated ISIL and overestimated the fighting capability of the Iraqi army.' 

President Obama jumped on Clapper's admission of error in a 60 Minutes interview that aired Sunday evening. 

When asked by veteran correspondent Steve Kroft if the ascent of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, came as a 'complete surprise' to him, Obama said: 'Well I think, our head of the intelligence community, Jim Clapper, has acknowledged that I think they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria.' 

The president immediately came under fire from intelligence and national security officials for the reproof, with one Obama administration staffer telling MailOnline that the Presidential Daily Briefs have included detailed information on the extremist group for at least the last two years.

'Unless someone very senior has been shredding the president's daily briefings and telling him that the dog ate them, highly accurate predictions about ISIL have been showing up in the Oval Office since before the 2012 election,' the national security staffer said.

The claims by the Obama administration insider accompanied a Government Accountability Institute report on Monday that showed that president Obama has attended just 42.1 percent of his intelligence briefings since taking office.

Former Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan indicated on Wednesday morning that even he was warned about ISIS in his high-level national security briefings leading up to the 2012 general election.

'We've been warned about ISIS for quite some time,' he told the hosts of Fox and Friends.

Christie assailed Obama for conveniently ignoring his own failure to correctly size up ISIS during a sit-down interview with Bash at a Baptist church in Newark, New Jersey

Christie assailed Obama on Tuesday conveniently ignoring his own failure to correctly size up ISIS during a sit-down interview with CNN's Bash at the Baptist church in Newark, New Jersey after participating in a panel on 'ending the stigma' of drug addiction.

In the one-on-one interview, Christie, a likely 2016 presidential candidate, touted his own leadership ability and pointed to the addiction event as proof that he can be tender-hearted and thoughtful when the circumstances allow.

Noting that his softer side has 'always been there' and his brash behavior is reported on in the media more frequently because 'it's the entertaining on television,' Christie told Bash that 'as a leader you need to be compassionate, and you need to listen.

'And I have that ability to do that, too,' Christie swore.

'And by the way,' he interjected moments later, 'when it's required to get in somebody's face and tell them off, I'll do that, too.'

Asked directly about his presidential ambitions, Christie gave the usual response, saying he hasn't decided and won't make an announcement until the new year.

His decision to weigh in on the president's handling of ISIS suggests otherwise, however. Christie, who also heads the Republican Governors Association, has said in the past that he won't give his opinion on national or international issues unless he runs in 2016.

The Garden State governor went so far this summer as to credit his inability to speak decisively on pressing national issues to his ignorance of federal policies. Christie has repeatedly said that his mind is firmly on the issues confronting his home state and his responsibilities as RGA chair.

Democratic National Committee spokesman Mike Czin told The Hill on Tuesday evening that Christie 'should stick to what he knows best: collecting credit downgrades and lane closures' and defended the president's record on national security.

'When it comes to serious national security issues, President Obama has degraded terror networks around the world, killed Osama bin Laden and worked with our allies to confront new threats while restoring America’s standing and authority around the world,' Czin told the news publication in an email.
