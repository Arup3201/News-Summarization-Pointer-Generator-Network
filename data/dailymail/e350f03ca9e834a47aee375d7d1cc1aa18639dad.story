Anthony Taylor thought that proposing to his girlfriend Stephanie Walker underwater during a scuba dive would be an unforgettable romantic gesture - but it almost had a tragic ending when she was so surprised she nearly drowned.

Luckily, instructors were on hand to help the shocked woman recover, and when she had regained her composure she accepted the proposal.

Mr Taylor, 27, and Miss Walker, 26, from Wolverhampton, were on holiday in the Turkish resort of Marmaris in August last year when he decided to propose.

Couple: Mr Taylor and Ms Walker have been together for a year after meeting on a night out in Wolverhampton

He approached scuba diving instructors, who helped him make a laminated card with the words 'Will you marry me?' written on it.

When they were 40ft below the surface of the water, Mr Taylor showed the card to Miss Walker - making her gasp and filling her mask with water.

The instructors helped ensure that she was safe, then handed her another laminated card to give her response as Mr Taylor held out a diamond ring.

After she accepted the proposal, the newly engaged couple returned to dry land, where they were greeted by a crowd of well-wishers.

Shock: Miss Walker gasped and let water into her mask, casing her to start choking

'We had mentioned marriage before but I had no idea he was going to do it then,' Miss Walker said. 'We had never been scuba diving before so it was a once in a lifetime chance really.

'We had air tanks and masks on and were both waving at a camera while posing with the fish.

'Then there was a tap on my shoulder. I turned to see my other half with a blackboard bearing the hand-written message "Will you marry me?"

'The guide quickly handed me a board which had "yes" on one side. I turned it over to check but it said "yes" on both sides!

'It was literally completely out of the blue. We were told by the instructors before "Don't breath though your nose", but when he proposed I definitely did and suddenly everything filled up with water.

'Luckily we had the instructors on hand because they were all in on it. They sorted me out and we got back to the boat.

'It was scary when the mask filled up with water but there so many people around us it was over quickly.

'The instructors all seemed to know what they were doing, and slipped the ring to Anthony while they fixed my mask.

'Once
 I was capable of breathing again, I saw the ring and Anthony put it on 
my finger. I still can't believe that is how he decided to propose.'

Mr
 Taylor, a kitchen manufacturer who was on his first holiday abroad, 
described how he was inspired to think up his unusual proposal.

'I was originally going to propose to Stephanie over dinner, or on the beach,' he said. 'But then I got a bit creative.

'I had bought the ring before we set off on holiday. And when I went to book the scuba diving trip, it got me thinking. I drew up the signs with the instructors beforehand.

'Stephanie needed some help with her mask after she saw the sign. She had water in her goggles but I knew she would be OK.'

The couple - who met on a night out in Wolverhampton a year ago - plan to get married in September 2015.

But Miss Walker, a customer services manager, has already got her dream dress after winning a contest to find the couple with the best proposal story.
