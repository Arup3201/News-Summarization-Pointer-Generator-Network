There's only one thing to do when the kids won't eat their vegetables: bribe them.

At least that's what some Colorado schools are doing now that Michelle Obama's Healthy and Hunger Free Kids Act has scared students away from their school lunch programs, according to KUSA.

Jefferson County Public Schools now has a 'Hungry to Win' raffle program, EagNews reports. Each time a student buys a lunch, they are entered in the raffle for a chance to win prizes such as jump ropes, kites, iTunes gift cards, and even bicycles and iPods.

Incentive: Jefferson County public schools in Colorado have implemented the 'Hungry to Win' raffle program, offering students prizes for eating school lunches 

Down: At Jeffco schools, school lunch sales were down six percent in fall 2013

'With all the new regulations and the changes that we've made, our lunch participation has gone down, Lori Burris, Jeffco Schools lunch facilitator, told KUSA. 'So, this was to be an incentive to try school lunch and maybe bring them back.'

Burris said school lunch sales were down six percent last year and she said school officials believe the decline is because students don't like the changes that have been made to make the lunches healthier. 

Anna Ketzer, a first grader at Devinny Elementart School, won a new bike as part of the raffle, according to KUSA.' She said that she was very excited to win the bike and likes the lunches because she doesn't have to make her own. 

Criticism: First Lady Michelle Obama has received criticism about the school lunches and some schools have even dropped out of the federal program

Come Back: Lori Burris, Jeffco Schools lunch facilitator, said that the lunches are 'a little different,' but the 'Hungry to Win' contest is an effort to encourage students to 'come back and try [the lunches]'

Burris said that the lunches are 'a little different,' but the 'Hungry to Win' contest is an effort to encourage students to 'come back and try [the lunches]', according to EagNews.

She said that the contest has resulted in school lunch sales increasing by four percent since it was first implemented.

Kay Burnett, a kitchen manager at Devinny, said that there are a lot of good food items offered at the school and she said she believes the raffle is a great idea.

Burris and Burnett praise the program, but few Facebook commenters share their views.

One commenter wrote: 'This is amazing! Jeffco is teaching our kids how to gamble! Not just to gamble, but to gamble to eat. Is the next field trip to Las Vegas so we can teach them how to live on the streets after they don't win? "Hey, buy our food and you could win a bike!" or "Hey, play our slots and you could win a car!" What's the difference?'

Others criticized the government, Michelle Obama, and questioned whether the school's approach is even legal.  

KUSA reports that the prizes were at no cost to the school district and came from food suppliers.
