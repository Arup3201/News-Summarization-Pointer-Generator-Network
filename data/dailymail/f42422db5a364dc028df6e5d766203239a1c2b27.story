The combined wealth of Australia's seven richest people is greater than the poorest 1.73 million households, new figures show.

The Australia Institute has warned that policies being adopted by the federal government are likely to widen the gap between the extremely wealthy and the nation's poorest.

Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows the bottom 20 percent of households have an estimated $54 million in wealth, while the nation's seven richest have a combined wealth of more than $60 billion.

Mining magnate Gina Rhinehart was named Australia's richest person last month with an estimated wealth of $20 billion

The country's richest – including Gina Rinehart ($20 billion), Anthony Pratt ($7.6 billion), James Packer ($7.19 billion), Frank Lowy ($7.16 billion), Ivan Glasenberg ($6.6 billion), Wing Mau Hui ($6.3 billion) and Andrew Forrest ($5.9 billion) – were named on the BRW Rich List last month.

The Australia Institute's paper, Income and Wealth Inequality in Australia, revealed how a reduction of the top marginal income tax rate has helped the rich get richer and ‘widened the disparity between wealth and incomes in Australia', the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

In an attack on the Abbott government's proposed budget cuts targeting low-income families, the institute's report suggests the gap between rich and poor will grow if payments to low-income families are reduced further.

The paper shows tax cuts by the government over the past eight years has contributed to the wealth divide, with the top 10 percent of earners benefiting more than the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers.

The government's decision to make welfare payments grow at a slower rate than wages could further increase the gap between the poor and wealth, Dr Richard Denniss, the Australia Institute's executive director, has warned.

He said many Australians were unaware of wage inequality, with a recent Australia Institute survey showing most people think the average income is similar to what they are earning – those who earn between $100,000 and $150,000 believe the average Australian earns the same.
