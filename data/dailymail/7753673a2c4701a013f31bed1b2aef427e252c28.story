A trendy bar is now serving a new cocktail - made from pizza.

The unique Pepperoni Passion cocktail, made using vodka and a pepperoni pizza, is on sale for 8.50 pounds.

It is mixed with tomato and lemon juice, four slices of pepperoni, basil and mozzarella cheese, before being rolled in a cocktail shaker.

The fresh ingredients are then added to the pepperoni infused vodka and then served in a traditional cocktail glass.

The unique Pepperoni Passion cocktail, made using vodka and a pepperoni pizza, is on sale for £8.50

The alcoholic beverage, made using a Pepperoni Passion from Domino's Pizza, was created to coincide with London Cocktail Week.

It is now on sale at the London Cocktail Club in Shoreditch and was created by the bar's founder, JJ Goodman.

The 30-year-old said: 'We decided to update the classic Bloody Mary formula.

The pepperoni vodka which is the base of the cocktail was made by cooking the meat and then adding the drained oil into plain vodka and leaving overnight 

'We stayed away from the savoury flavour profile and instead, using the tomato sauce for its fruity qualities; matched it with passion fruit and a hint of spice.  

Cocktail ingredients

50ml of pepperoni infused vodka

75ml of tomato juice

15ml of fresh pressed lemon juice

20ml of passion fruit puree

10ml of sugar syrup (equal parts caster sugar to water)

1 tea spoon of hot sauce

Pizza garnish

4 x slices of pepperoni

2 x small pieces of mozzarella cheese

Handful of basil

'The challenge of creating a cocktail to showcase the flavours of Domino's Pepperoni pizza was totally up our street. 

'We love pushing the boundaries of cocktail creation whilst keeping things exciting and enticing for our customers.

'To create the pepperoni infused vodka, we cook off 500g of pepperoni in a pan with no oil, wait for the oil to come naturally from the pepperoni, add the oil to a bottle of vodka then put in the freezer overnight.

'The next morning the juices from the pepperoni will have set, while the flavour molecules will have attached themselves to the vodka.

'Strain off the solids and 'voila' - pepperoni infused vodka.'

A Domino's Pizza spokeswoman said: 'We are amazed how our most popular pizza has been transformed in to a tasty drink.

'The Pepperoni Passion Cocktail has worked wonders - you can really taste the spicy pepperoni and our incredibly fresh vine ripened tomato sauce.'
