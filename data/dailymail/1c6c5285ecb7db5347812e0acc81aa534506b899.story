Fragile: Civil partnerships have begun to break up at the same rate as marriages

Civil partnerships have begun to break up at a speed approaching the divorce rates of heterosexual couples.

The number of partnerships legally dissolved in England and Wales shot up by 20 per cent last year and has more than doubled in three years.

Analysts said the figures could suggest that some civil partners – among whom the longest-lasting partnerships have been registered for just under eight  years – are experiencing the ‘seven-year itch’.

However, while for heterosexual couples the peak age of divorce is the early 40s, for same-sex civil partners – who typically legalise their relationships at a much older age than heterosexuals – the highest level of break-ups is among younger people, especially among women in their 20s and 30s.

Nearly a third of all the civil partners who ended their partnership last year were women under 40.

The
 average age of a civil partner whose relationship dissolved in England 
last year was actually younger than the average age at which gay or 
lesbian couples register a civil partnership.

Lawyers said the growing number of dissolutions meant partnership break-ups were comparable with divorce.

The Office for National Statistics 
said the number of civil  partnerships celebrated in 2012 was 7,037, an 
increase of 3.6 per cent on 2011.

Dissolutions in 2012 rose by 20 per cent, to 794 from 663 in 2011.

Vicki McLynn of Pannone Solicitors said: ‘The likelihood of civil partnerships experiencing a seven-year itch should perhaps not come as that much of a surprise given that the issues which the couples involved face are broadly the same as those who are married.

Equality: Although the rates of dissolution are proving the same, civil partnerships break up at a younger age than marriages

‘The greatest possibility of husbands and wives divorcing occurs when they have been married between four and eight years and these new figures fit that pattern for civil partners too.’

‘More than half the dissolutions recorded
 in 2012 ended female partnerships and women were almost twice as likely
 as men to break up a civil partnership.’

Alison Hawes of Irwin Mitchell said: 
‘The number of civil partnerships that have taken place is reaching a 
substantial critical mass now and it is expected that these 
relationships will follow the general trends of marriage and divorce.

‘It is a common generalisation that there is a seven-year itch when relationships supposedly become more difficult.

‘In
 reality, it is often a few years into relationships that couples think 
about separating as things may not have worked out as planned.

'Same issues': A divorce expert said the phenomenon is unsurprising since same-sex couples face similar problems to heterosexual ones

'The
 statistics show that the first 10 years are the most vulnerable in a 
marriage, and the same seems to be true of civil partnerships.’

Civil partnership dissolution rates remain below those of marriage – 3.2 per cent of male and 6.1 per cent of female partnerships have broken up in England and Wales – but the pattern appears close to that of divorce among heterosexual married couples.

Overall, 455 female partnerships ended in 2012 and 339 male partnerships. The figures apply only to England and Wales because 2012 figures for Scotland remain unpublished.

The average age of someone whose partnership was dissolved in England and Wales last year was 38.6 - while the average age of someone registering a civil partnership in England was 38.9.

The ONS said: ‘The rising number of dissolutions is a consequence of the increasing number of civil partners living in the UK.’

Overall, 60,454 civil partnerships have been registered since 2005. Laws allowing same-sex marriage come into effect next year.

Figures, released by the Office for National Statistics, also show that people in civil partnerships separate younger than those in marriages
