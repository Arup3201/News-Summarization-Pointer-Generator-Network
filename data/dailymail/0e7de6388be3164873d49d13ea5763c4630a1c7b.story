An amphibious surveillance unit in the shape of a ball has been unveiled that can roll over both land and sea.

Known as the GuardBot, the machine can move through mud, sand and snow without getting stuck.

It’s creators say it could be used to accompany special operations teams in conflict zones - or even carry explosives to an enemy location.

A US company is developing an autonomous drone shaped like a sphere. Called GuardBot it has cameras on either side so it can be steered. It is moved using a pendulum system that shifts its centre of gravity

Guardbot was created by a research team in Stamford, Connecticut, and is currently being tested with the US Marines.

The secret to its efficiency is a patented drive mechanism.

A controlled pendulum keeps the center of gravity very close to the inside surface of the sphere.

At rest, the centre of gravity is close to the ground.

To create momentum, a built-in motor raises the pendulum.

This changes the center of gravity and GroundBot begins to roll in the direction that the pendulum has been moved. 

Not only does it take very little energy to drive GroundBot, but virtually no noise is generated either. So GroundBot moves around without drawing attention to itself.

According to Defense One, the machine can swim over water at about four miles (six kilometres) per hour, as its low density allows it to float.

It can then roll along a beach at up to a 30 degree incline at 20 miles (32km) per hour.

It weighs just 55lbs (25kg), with cameras on board allowing a remote driver to see where they are going.

The spherical design allows for its interior to be protected, with sand or even dangerous gas unable to get inside to damage the electronics.

It runs on a rechargeable battery, with around eight to 16 hours of activity available depending on the mission profile, and it takes about three to four hours to recharge. 

Its cameras give it a 360-degree field of vision, while it can carry cargo weighing up to 4.4lbs (two kilograms).

According to GuardBot Inc, the design was originally intended to be used for a space planetary mission on Mars - but has since been repurposed for use on Earth.

‘GuardBot is the only known spherical unmanned amphibious vehicle systems that can navigate upstream,’ the company says on their website.

According to Defense One, in order to steer it ‘uses a nine-axis stabilization, “pendulum motion” propulsion system, which moves the bot forward by shifting the center of gravity back and forth and a variety of steering algorithms.’

Amazingly, the whole design is also scalable. A GuardBot could be made as small as four inches (10cm) across, and as large as nine feet (2.7 metres).

The prototype, meanwhile, will be six feet (1.8 metres).

For now, GuardBot is driven around by a remote operator, but the team ultimately want to make it autonomous so that you can pick a spot on a map, and it can get there by itself.
