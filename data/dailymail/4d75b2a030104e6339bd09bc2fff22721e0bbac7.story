Just when you thought that communicating by snail mail was obsolete, one inventive entrepreneur has created a way to send a message loud and clear- with a sugary and brightly coloured bag of lolly penises.

D**ks by Mail is a new website created to  send anyone in your life  feelings of 'sadness, disappointment and betrayal' through the anonymous gift of confectionery phallises.

'In only a few minutes you can send a literal Bag of D**ks to that special a***ole in your life,' explains the site.

For US$15 (plus postage), the site will send a 150 gram bag of lolly penises to the person of your choosing

'You know the one. The annoying guy at the office. Your Ex who decided to see other people before telling you,' the site says.

'The Teacher that doesn't care about your dead grandma. The person that murdered your grandma.'

For US$15 (plus postage), the site will send a 150 gram bag of lolly penises to the person of your choosing, with a note that says 'EAT A BAG OF D**KS'.

'You will remain anonymous and silently chuckle to yourself for years to come as you picture them slowly degrading into a shell of the person they once were, always questioning their lives,' the site says.

'"Who sent this to me?", "Are there more d**ks on their way?" and "Why does this keep happening to me?!". Yes their slow decent into madness will be much tastier than the bag of candy d**ks you sent to them.' 

Despite encouraging potential customers to send the package to their chosen enemies place of work to heighten the level of embarrassment the gummy penises will create, the site specifically says that it is against bullying.

The package will be sent anonymously with a note that reads 'EAT A BAG OF D**KS'

One social media user posted photos of a 'mystery package' he received with no return address

'Offended, but delighted,' the user claimed. 'The worst part is..they're delicious.'

'This site was created to put a smile on peoples faces. It's not meant to be a threat or a way to bully,' says a note on the site. 

'If you are sending this with the intent to ruin someones day, then maybe its you who needs to eat a bag of d**ks.'

'In only a few minutes you can send a literal Bag of D**ks,' says the site

While the site may be a publicity stunt, as the creator of 'Ship Your Enemies Glitter' claimed, people are actually buying the packages to send around the world.

One social media user posted photos of a 'mystery package' he received with no return address, which turned out to be one such order from the site.

'Offended, but delighted,' the user claimed.

'The worst part is..they're delicious.'

The post has received over 800,000 views in three days, and many social media users demanding to know where the package came from so they could order the same for their enemies.

The concept is the most recent in a spate of similar websites, including Ship Your Enemies Glitter, a 'hoax' site created by 22-year-old Australian Mat Carpenter.

The site would send glitter to anyone for $10, concealed in an envelope with a note explaining why it was being sent.

'We hate glitter. People call it the herpes of the craft world...There's someone in your life right now who you can't stand,' the site says.

'So pay us money, provide an address anywhere in the world & we'll send them so much glitter in an envelope that they'll be finding that shit everywhere for weeks. We'll also include a note telling the person exactly why they're receiving this terrible gift.'

Carpenter sold the site for $85,000 after receiving a reported 270,000 orders in less than a day.
