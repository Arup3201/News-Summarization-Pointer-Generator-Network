A Chicago area woman won her 15th straight Jeopardy! game on Friday night - and now has the longest winning streak ever for a female contestant on the show.

Julia Collins, 31, won $30,800 on Friday - meaning her total Jeopardy! winnings are $314,900, according to The Chicago Tribune.

Winner: Collins is seen standing next to Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek

Collins, who is between jobs, told the Tribune earlier this week that her winnings might offer some relief to 'those who are wondering why I'm not looking harder for another job.'

She told the paper she used high school textbooks to get ready for episode tapings, which occurred in January and February.

Collins' 15 wins also mean she has the third-longest winning streak on the show, the Tribune points out. David Madden won 19 times in a row in 2005 and Ken Jennings had a 74-game streak in 2004.

Collins studied Art History at Wellesley College before she received a Masters of Engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

On 
Facebook, Collins has used screen grabs of her appearances on the show 
as her profile pictures - and even shared a picture of her standing next
 to Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek.

The champion has also used the picture as her Twitter profile picture. Collins live-tweets episodes under the handle @JeopardyJulia and also shares tidbits from behind the scenes. She currently has over 3,000 followers.

'Alex Trebek makes a lot more eye contact with contestants and is much more engaged with us than you can see on TV.  #jeopardy,' Collins tweeted on Thursday.

'It’s weird to watch yourself on television,' Collins told Slice of MIT, an alumni association website. 'I can see the look of frustration on my face when I don’t know an answer. Plus, it’s interesting to see the dynamics of the other contestants.'

Collins also described the buzzers that contestants use as 'an art and a science.'

Regarding her streak, Collins told the website ' I’m not just pretty good for a girl, I’m pretty good for anyone.'
