Mr and Mrs Ghandi has accused the council worker of ripping their front gate off its hinges

A couple has accused a council worker of ripping their padlocked front gate off its hinges so he could check if they were recycling properly. 

The officer from Croydon Council, in south London, was sent to question Bharat and Sheila Gandhi, who had been reported to the local authority for not leaving paper, glass and plastics out for collection.

But when the officer arrived at the house in South Norwood and realised he couldn't get in, he allegedly forced the gate off its hinges.

Unbeknown to him, he was being filmed by the couple's CCTV camera which had been installed after the house was burgled in 2011. 

Mr and Mrs Gandhi say they take their waste to Factory Lane recycling centre by hand and have accused the council of 'intrusion'. 

Mr Gandhi, 60, said: 'The behaviour by the council person was inexcusable and even dangerous as he left our property vulnerable and without any reason.'

The council, which said the damage was accidental, has offered to refund the £100 repair costs. 

However, Mrs Gandhi, 56, said: 'It is not about money, it is about the principle. It would have taken a lot of force to break the gate.

'There is a bell for people to ring, which he did not.'

The couple run the local Neighbourhood Watch group and lost £20,000 of possessions when they were burgled.

Success: After a tricky start the council worker manages to gain access to the property

They also accused the officer of not having ID on him when he visited again on April 17.

A council spokesman said: 'We're waiting for details of the necessary repairs and we will compensate the homeowners appropriately for this accidental damage. 

'Staff on the team have been reminded of the importance of carrying their ID at all times and if, as in this case, they have left it at home, a temporary form of identification will be arranged.'
