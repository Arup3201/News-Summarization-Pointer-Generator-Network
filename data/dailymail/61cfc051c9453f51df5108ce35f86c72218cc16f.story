Vicente del Bosque claimed Spain were entering a 'new era' after their first competitive game since a hugely disappointing World Cup.

Goals from Sergio Ramos, Pedro, David Silva, Sergio Busquets and debutant Paco Alcacer gave Spain a comfortable 5-1 victory over Macedonia in their opening European Championships qualifier.

Spanish paper Sport went with the headline: 'The future is yours,' accompanied by a picture Barcelona youngster Munir.

Marca and As were also full of praise for the revitalised national side. Marca claimed that Spain had 'rediscovered' themselves while also praising Iker Casillas's performance.

As also commended Spain on their style and quoted Del Bosque as saying: 'In the World Cup we lost our reputation. We have started a new era.'

Meanwhile, the Italian press focused on new Italy manager Antonio Conte's competitive debut after the Azzurri beat the Netherlands.
