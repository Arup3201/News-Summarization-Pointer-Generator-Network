Ohio officials suggest in a new report it's possible Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro may have died of auto-erotic asphyxiation, not suicide.

A report from the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction says Castro's pants and underwear were pulled down to his ankles when he was found.

It also says Castro did not leave a suicide note and 'multiple levels of assessment' did not find tendency toward suicide.

Monster: Ariel Castro kept three young girls captive in his house, torturing and raping them for over a decade, before he was found dead after having been in prison for a month

The state forwarded those facts to police to consider the possibility of auto-erotic asphyxiation, whereby individuals achieve sexual satisfaction by briefly choking themselves into near unconsciousness.

The report also says two prison guards falsified logs documenting their observation of Castro in the hours before he killed himself.

The report says video indicates no checks were done on Castro at least eight times before he died.

Earlier details about his death, which was originally believed to be a suicide, revealed that he had a handwritten list of Bible verses and the names of all of his children and grandchildren.

A Bible open to the book of John was also found when prison guards discovered his lifeless body hanging from a hinge from his cell window using a bedsheet.

Franklin County Coroner Jan Gorniak said she's awaiting toxicology results before issuing a final report on Castro's September 3 suicide. The preliminary notes indicate he suffered from hardening of the arteries.

The significance of why he had the Book of John open at the time of his death is unknown, but some of the more prominent stories told in that section of the Bible include descriptions of the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus.

Castro, 53, pleaded guilty in August to nearly 1,000 counts related to his imprisonment of three women in his Cleveland home for a decade, including aggravated murder – for forcing one of the victims to miscarry – kidnapping, rape and other crimes.

Castro kidnapped the women – Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry, and Gina DeJesus – between 2002 and 2004 when they were 14, 16 and 20 years old.

Berry escaped on May 6 and alerted authorities, at first bringing joy to the city where they had become household names after years of searches and vigils, then despair as details of their treatment emerged.

Castro's suicide is the subject of three prison reviews. Two, looking at the circumstances of his death and at mental and medical health treatment he received beforehand, are due at month's end.

Shame: Investigations into Castro's death are still underway

A third review is being done by two nationally known prison conditions experts. That review, announced this week, also examines the Aug. 4 suicide of death row inmate Billy Slagle three days before his scheduled execution.The study, due November 15, will also examine prison suicides over the past two years and make recommendations for any changes to the state's policies and procedures for stopping inmates from killing themselves.
