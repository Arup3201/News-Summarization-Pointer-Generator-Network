A B-52 aircraft drops a scramjet' during tests in California: A B-52 could be used in an offensive on Iran

America and Israel are considering a joint surgical strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, it was claimed today.

Foreign Policy magazine reported a source 'close to the discussions' and said the strike might compose primarily of bombers and drone support.

The suggested attack is expected to last no more than a few days - or even just 'a couple of hours', the magazine said.

Such a strike could be carried out without civilian casualties, and would set back the Iranian nuclear program by back many years.

Benefits of such a strike would be regional, Foreign Policy says.

The source, said to be in favour of the strike, said the Israel-led assault would be 'transformative' and would end up 'saving Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, reanimating the peace process, securing the (Persian) Gulf, sending an unequivocal message to Russia and China, and assuring American ascendancy in the region for a decade to come.'

However the strike would need the support of outside countries, particularly the U.S. - 'whether acting alone or in concert with Israel and others.'

The report added that, with the progress made between Israel and the U.S. administration recently, a strike could help President Barack Obama defuse his opponent's Mitt Romney's criticisms about Iran.

The report concluded: 'It's not the size of the threatened attack but the likelihood that it will actually be made, that makes a military threat a useful diplomatic tool. And perhaps a political one, too.'

Mitt Romney, seen here meeting students in Virginia, said Obama was 'sitting on the sidelines'

This week Romney recently vowed to 
help arm Syrian rebels fighting against President Bashar Assad's brutal 
regime as part of a push to abandon President Barack Obama's 'passive' 
leadership in the Middle East.

In
a foreign policy speech at the Virginia Military Institute, said he 
would 'will work with our partners to identify and organise those 
members of the opposition who share our values and ensure they obtain 
the arms they need to defeat Assadâ€™s tanks, helicopters, and fighter 
jets'.

He accused Obama of 
'sitting on the sidelines', quoting a Syrian woman as accusing the 
President of abandoning Syria, saying: 'We will not forget that you 
forgot about us.'

Romney argued that rebel forces in 
Syria could be important future allies against Iran. 'Iran is sending 
arms to Assad because they know his downfall would be a strategic defeat
for them,' he said.

He stopped short, however, of advocating that the U.S. directly arm the rebels.
