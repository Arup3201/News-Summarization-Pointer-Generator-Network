Barcelona star Neymar is certainly no stranger to giving opponents the run-around and it would seem even his pet dog gets similar treatment.

The 23-year-old took to Instagram on Friday to show-off a short clip of himself playing a game with his pet pooch named Poker.

Neymar begins by playing hide-and-seek around the dog's kennel before attempting to catch up with Poker and failing to do so.

Poker seems to get the better of Neymar, which is more than can be said for Villarreal, who were beaten 3-1 by Barca in the Copy del Rey semi-final second leg on Wednesday.

The Brazilian youngster tormented the Villarreal defence throughout and grabbed two goals as Luis Enrique's side booked a final spot alongside Atheltic Bilbao.

Neymar's playful pooch video marks an end to a brilliant week after he was named in the Brazil squad for the forthcoming internationl friendlies against  France and Chile.

'Since he has been designated captain of the team, he has had an upgrade on his level of football,' Dunga said of Neymar.

'He likes challenges, the more responsibility he has, the more he will develop and get better.

'We are very happy to have him; he is doing fantastic things in Europe.
