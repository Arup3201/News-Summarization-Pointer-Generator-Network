Any allotment is a labour of love, requiring hours of meticulous effort and precise trimming to make it just so.

But green-fingered Pearl Taylor has taken precision gardening to a new level by creating a garden small enough to fit on a table-top.

Mrs Taylor, 65, who has tended a full-size plot for 10 years, shook up her local allotment society when she unveiled her creation - which mimics the full-size version in amazing detail.

Pearl Taylor's pristine plot measures just 34 inches by 16 inches

The tiny allotment is an exact copy of the full-sized plot tended by Mrs Taylor

Her mini-allotment, which is 
just 34 inches wide and 16 inches long, was lovingly constructed from 
astroturf, plywood, and even made tiny cuttings of plants to represent full-size flowers and veg.

Mrs Taylor, a grandmother of four from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, is the secretary of her allotment society and came up with the tiny project for a horticultural show.

She said: 'I just came up with the idea for something different - when I unveiled it they were very impressed.'

Mrs Taylor crafted this tiny shed from plywood and roofing felt

All of the replica plants are made of living material - the leeks are blades of grass, the cauliflowers are tiny flower buds and the beetroots are browning conifer leaves

'I've always done lots of knitting but I've never done anything like this before.

‘The shed is plywood with real roofing
felt and the greenhouse is made out of clear plastic. The grass is bits
of astroturf and the plants are real living plants, from bits of grass 
to flowers, for all the crops.’

'It took me months... you can't actually get veg to grow as small as that so it's not really edible but it looks good.'

Mrs Taylor started work on the project over a year ago and had it ready for the 
growing season. It will be on display in a local village show next 
week.
