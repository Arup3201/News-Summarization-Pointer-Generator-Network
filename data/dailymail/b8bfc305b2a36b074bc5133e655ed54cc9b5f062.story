Police are investigating after the mother of a teenager killed with two friend in a car that crashed into a wall received hate mail telling her to 'get a life'.

Josh Stewart, 16, died along with David Armstrong, 15, and Jenna Barbour, 17, in Tyninghame near Edinburgh last November.

Susan Stewart 49, has been fundraising for a memorial since the incident but has received a letter telling her she lacked 'dignity' at her refusal to let her son's death go.

Threats: Susan Stewart with her son Josh, 16, who died last year, and has since had hate mail telling her to 'get over it' after she started fundraising for a memorial

The note was pushed through her door addressed to 'fat b****' and called her 'self centred' for seeking 'poor taste publicity' in her bid to raise funds.

The letter went on to say: 'We also notice that your husband is never mentioned in your interviews.

'Someone said you have split up - no wonder how could any man live with such as self-centred woman.

'Maybe you can now draw a line over the whole incident and Get A Life.'

The words 'Get A Life,' were underlined at the bottom of the note, which also claimed that 'loads of people share this opinion.'

Much loved: Josh's family and friends have been left heartbroken over his death and said the letter has made their pain worse

Tragedy: David Armstrong and Jenna Barbour also lost their lives in the car crash last year

Scene: Last number the car they were in crashed into this wall near Edinburgh. Another teenager is going on trial over the deaths

Mrs Stewart said: 'I am absolutely shocked that someone could think I enjoy all the publicity since Josh passed away.

'If I had my way I would never be in the papers, but I am trying to raise cash for various tributes to my son and his two friends.

'It is only little things like a tribute bench and a memorial at the crash site, but the mean so much to me and, from what I have been told, also to the local community.

'I don't think I have acted in an undignified manner at all, but some people are just evil with nothing else to do but have a go at others.

'I don't really know what I've done to upset this person, but I feel I have been through enough over the past few months without having to deal with this kind of thing.'

Police Scotland confirmed that they have received a complaint regarding the letter and said that 'enquiries are at an early stage.'

Sixteen-year-old Robbie Gemmell, from Dunbar, East Lothian, is due to stand trial after he was charged with causing death by driving while unlicensed, disqualified or uninsured, and causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving. He was also charged with attempting to defeat the ends of justice.
