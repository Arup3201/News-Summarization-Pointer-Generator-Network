Expensive garb: Baroness Frances D'Souza seen in the Queens Robing Room following her introduction into the House Of Lords

Wigs, ceremonial outfits and their accessories for peers and their staff at Westminster have cost taxpayers a staggering £57,000, it was revealed today.

Crossbench peer Baroness D'Souza of Wychwood alone has had £8,234 spent on her outfits since being elected to the job in September 2011.

The public purse also stumped up thousands for small items like a wig for Clerk of the Parliaments 
David Beamish which had a £2,045 price tag, The Sun reported.

His court coat and 
waistcoat cost another £2,625, a Freedom of Information request in covering the last three years revealed.

There was a £5,200 bill for uniform for Black Rod, Lieutenant General David Leakey, and £8,472 was spent on 37 uniforms for doorkeepers.

In the House of Commons, a separate Freedom of Information request revealed a wig bag for the Deputy Serjeant at Arms cost £45.83p and two jabots for the assistant, which cost £116.66p.

Nine pairs of stockings for the Serjeant at Arms cost £262,63p.

Last year, the Serjeant's assistant was also given a pair of breeches that cost £1,075 and a coat and waistcoat that came in at £3,050.

The Speaker John Bercow himself was kitted out with a robe that cost £1,130, a pair of breeches for his assistant cost £1,075 with a bill of £3,050 for a coat and waistcoat.

The assistant was also provided with three pairs of gloves, two white, one black, four shirts, a skirt, a wig bag, two lace cuffs, a shoe buckle, two jabots, seven collar studs, a court coat and one tailcoat and skirt.

In total, that cost £3,496.

Robert Oxley, from the Taxpayers' Alliance, told MailOnline: 'We appreciate the tradition of the House of Lords, but just don't think it should cost a fortune.

'The peers need to reduce their finery and fancy tayloring and ensure preserving tradition doesn't cost so much.

'Given the age of the House of Lords, a second hand robe will hardly go amiss for a year.'
