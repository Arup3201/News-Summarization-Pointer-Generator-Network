God Save the Queen bellowed out in the Stade de France after England's Jonny Wilkinson inspired Toulon to victory in the French Top 14 final the week after they claimed the Heineken Cup.

Wilkinson's final game of an illustrious career saw his prodigious boot feature as he kicked five three-pointers, including one trademark drop goal, in Toulon's win to claim a first domestic title since 1992.

They also took their revenge for the defeat in last year's final against the same plucky opponents.

It was meant to be all about Wilkinson, with 'merci Jonny' stitched into all the Toulon team shirts, and it was all about him in a packed Stade de France, with the black and red army occupying the south end of the stadium. Â

Hitting home: Wilkinson's final game ended with victory and adulation from the French crowd

When the 
PA played the England national anthem - while Wilkinson was being 
interview in French - at the end there was to be no doubt as to the 
esteem in which he's held in his adopted home.

'I
 would like the thank the whole team, the crowd but also Castres and all
 the other teams in the Top 14. I don't have the words, can't thank the 
French public enough,' Wilkinson said.

'Thank you for all the memories. I have spent more than half my life with a rugby ball, it's going to be a big change.'

Wilkinson
 scored four penalties and a drop goal while fellow Englishman Delon 
Armitage sealed it with his own three-pointer from long range with eight
 minutes left.

Beloved: The Toulon fans give the England star a hero's send-off

Saviour: Toulon president Mourad Boudjellal, whose millions have helped the club back from the brink

Honoured: The build-up was all about Wilkinson and the result ran to script

Castres' points came from Rory Kockott's boot and a try from Max Evans.

Early
 on a Wilkinson penalty put Toulon ahead, only for the defending 
champions to open a 7-3 lead when Evans scored an 80-metre try after 
following up his own kick.

Kockott
 added the extras but Toulon had the dominant pack and Wilkinson, who 
added two penalties and a 23-metre drop goal to put his side just ahead 
at halftime.

Toulon
 opened a five-point lead early in the second half when Wilkinson curled
 a three-pointer over from a tight angle before handing the kicking 
duties to Armitage when a penalty on the left was too far for his 
perfect technique to handle.
