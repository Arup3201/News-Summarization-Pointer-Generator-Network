A death row inmate has been saved from execution just hours before he was scheduled to die today by lethal injection for the murder of a teenage girl.

The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals today sent the case of 56-year-old Hubert Lester Michael Jr back to a district court 
judge for additional proceedings.

The Pennsylvania inmate had faced a 7pm (EST) execution for the 1993 killing of 16-year-old Trista Elizabeth Eng in York County.

He would have been the first person 
executed in the state since 1999 and the only one in the past 50 years who had not voluntarily given up 
on his appeals.

His defense 
lawyers welcomed the decision and said their client has 'compelling 
legal claims which have never been reviewed by any court'.

The attorney 
general's office declined to comment over the killer's stay of execution at Rockview Prison in Pennsylvania.

Michael pleaded guilty to murdering 
Eng after kidnapping her in York County. At a 1997 hearing, his former 
public defender testified that Michael told him how he picked up the 
girl hitchhiking, bound her with electrical cord, 
raped her and killed her on state game land.

He was not charged with rape due to a lack of physical evidence, though prosecutors suspected it.

Michael
confessed to his brother, who located her remains about a month after 
she disappeared and called police. Miss Eng had been shot in the head and 
chest.

Attorneys for Michael have previously argued that his Asperger's syndrome prevented him from accepting a life sentence he was originally offered.

The disorder can cause sufferers to have trouble with social situations, be uncomfortable with changes in routine or have heightened sensitivities to certain situations.

Since he was sentenced to death, 
Michael had abandoned his appeals but later resumed a legal fight, 
saying he had been confined under circumstances at Graterford State 
Prison that worsened mental health problems.

Those problems got better 
after he was transferred, his lawyers have 
argued.

At Wednesday's pardons board hearing,
the victim's mother, Suzanne Eng, set the tone for relatives and 
friends who made emotional pleas to keep the execution on track.

Mrs Eng said: 'He kidnapped her, he raped her and 
then he executed her.

'As she begged him not to kill 
her, he shot her three times.'

With regards the stay of execution, the circuit court panel directed the 
district court to address, among other things, whether Michael's appeal 
should be considered a successive petition that is subject to stricter 
rules, whether 'extraordinary circumstances' existed and whether a 
district court proceeding is needed to consider the merits of Michael's 
claims.

In a filing on Thursday, the attorney 
general's office said Michael is pursuing a 'successive' federal appeal 
that is subject to more strict court rules.

Halted: The murderer's execution at Rockview prison in Pennsylvania was stopped by judges at the eleventh hour today

Prosecutors wrote: 'Michael's entire argument was that, 
since the time of his voluntary waiver, the circumstances of his 
confinement have improved and effected some concomitant amelioration of 
his spirit. He has developed relationships ... and he has changed his 
mind.

'Even if true, this argument is in no way 
similar to a complaint of error at the district court proceeding based 
on failure to exhaust, procedural default, or the relevant statute of 
limitations.'

Pennsylvania has more than 200 people on death row, the greatest number after California, Texas and Florida.

The lack of executions has been 
attributed to a number of factors. Prosecutors claim an anti-death penalty bias on the part 
of appeals' judges, while defense attorneys note many of the sentences 
have been proved to be flawed and overturned on legitimate legal 
grounds.
