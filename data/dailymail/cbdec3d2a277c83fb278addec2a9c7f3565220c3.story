Built on the request of businessmen who often find themselves in dangerous situations - no, really - a bespoke tailoring house in Toronto today unveiled a hand-tailored three-piece 'bulletproof' suit.

Garrison Bespoke invited members of the media to the Rod and Gun Club in Ontario to fire off a few rounds at a bust form dressed in the navy pinstripe vest, matching two-button jacket and trousers that they claim can stop a speeding bullet.

The outfit has been made with several sheets of carbon nano-tubes - a state-of-the-art puncture-proof and bullet-resistant material sourced through a company that provides anti-ballistic gear for the U.S. Army Special Forces.

The patented material is thinner, more flexible and 50 per cent stronger than Kevlar, the traditional material used for bulletproof gear.

In an added bonus, the suit also protects against stabbing, with the carbon nano-tubes created to harden on impact, preventing a knife from penetrating through.

Inspection: Media at a demonstration of the suit's capabilities were invited to both shoot at the three-piece outfit and see whether the bullets penetrated

Proof: A slug is revealed from caught between the lining

Everyday wear: The suit was created to look exactly like any other well-tailored despite its special features

While Garrison Bespoke announced that all the suits in their new line, called Town & Country, can be made bulletproof by request, it doesn't come cheap.

Prices start at $20,000.

But what price would you put on your life and looking good?

'After receiving requests from high-profile clients who travel to dangerous places for work, we set out to develop a lightweight, fashion-forward bulletproof suit as a more discreet and stylish alternative to wearing a bulky vest underneath,' Michael Nguyen, co-owner and bespoke tailor of Garrison Bespoke told The Globe And Mail.

Perhaps the bigger question is, though, how badly do you want to tell your friends that you own a bulletproof suit?

Mr Ngyuen likened some of the clients who 
have ordered a Garrison Bespoke in bulletproof to guys that buy sports cars
which never leave the garage.

'They may never wear the suit, but they still want to own one,' he said.

Comparatively, a made-to-order suit from
designer labels like Gucci and Valentino cost about $3,500, while an 
off-the-rack black suit from Dolce & Gabbana is about $2,200.

The nano-tube fibers - which were woven into the suits lining as sheets - were so strong they had to be cut with a band saw while making the suits.

They are also said to cause less bruising than other available bulletproof gear. 

Carbon nano-tubes are 50 per cent lighter than Kevlar and 30 times stronger than steel, which is why they are increasingly being used to make more streamlined protective gear for military and security professionals, not to mention politicians.

U.S. President Barack Obama was rumored to have worn an overcoat and suit incorporating carbon nano-tubes during his first inauguration.

Mr Ngyuen said it was around that time one of Garrison's clients, a cosmetics-company executive, was assassinated in the Philippines.

'Many of our customers work in finance, mining and oil, and are often traveling to dangerous parts of certain countries,' Mr. Nguyen said.

'They could dress in casual clothes to not stand out, but they wear suits to make a good impression and be taken seriously.

'It only makes sense that they should have access to one that will make them look professional, but also feel safe.'

Maxwell Morgan, CEO of Aramor Payments, an electronic-payments provider serving e-commerce companies worldwide, was one person considering buying one of the new suits following the demonstration.

'I’m married with three children, so I’m always concerned about getting home [from work trips] safely,' he said.

The nano-tube fibers used as the bulletproof technology were so strong during the making of the suit they had to be cut with a ban saw. Here a tailor shows how pieces were cut using fabric stencils so they could be easily slipped into the lining of a regular suit

Mr Morgan does not travel with security and will travel to Africa and Colombia on business in the coming months.

'I don’t like the idea of wearing a heavy bulletproof vest, but a jacket that fits like a glove and is made with military-grade material that’s stronger than Kevlar – why not?' he said.

Miguel Caballero, a Colombian company which coined itself the 'Armani of bulletproof attire', have been developing similiar pieces since the 1990s.
