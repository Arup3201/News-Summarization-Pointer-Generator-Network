Brendan Rogers insists Steven Gerrard will be in the perfect frame of mind to lead England at the World Cup after his season ended in crushing disappointment.

Liverpool’s captain endured a draining few weeks as the race for the Barclays Premier League reached its climax, most notably when he slipped and gifted Chelsea a goal in the key game on April 27.

Gerrard looked shattered after the final match against Newcastle, admitting he was “absolutely devastated” to miss out on the title and has been away this week, like the rest of Liverpool’s international players, to recharge.

But Rodgers maintains no blame should be apportioned to Gerrard for Liverpool’s failure to fend off Manchester City and he is confident there will be no hangover in Gerrard’s performances when he starts playing in Brazil.

‘I’ve no concerns whatsoever about Steven,’ said Rodgers. 'I think Steven will go away and when he reflects on what has been personally a brilliant season of football, he has been very unfairly pointed out in terms of his slip.

‘It could have happened in the third game it could have happened in the fourth game but it certainly wasn’t anywhere near the defining moment of our season. That wasn’t what cost us the league. It was more games when we won the games.

‘When we won 5-3 at stoke when we conceded, when we won 6-3 at Cardiff, when we won 4-3 at home and conceded three. It was those games, not Steven’s slip or Kolo’s misplaced pass.

‘He is a very conscientious boy and he loves Liverpool. He is very hard on himself and he’s his own worst critic but he comes away recognising that he has been involved in a real title run in and next season he will be better for it.

Rodgers added: ‘He will take that confidence into a World Cup. I always say to players “when you go to England don’t think of Liverpool - think about your country and the team you are playing for.”

‘One of his qualities is that he can do that. He is a model professional at that, he is very proud to play for England and captain his country and i am sure he will go and do the country proud again.’

Meanwhile, Rodgers is determined to strengthen his Liverpool squad sooner rather than later this summer. He has targeted forward Xherdan Shaqiri from Bayern Munich and is looking at Southampton’s Dejan Lovren to bolster his defence.

Shaqiri, who has started just 10 league matches for Bayern this season, would suit Liverpool's high-tempo style and is in need of more time on the pitch.

Lovren had impressed at Southampton this season and Rodgers, who is also keen on Cardiff's Steven Caulker, is considering him as a candidate to fill the centre of defence.

The Liverpool boss is also keen on his former Chelsea youth team player Ryan Bertrand, while Sevilla’s £15m-rated Alberto Moreno could be another option to come in at left-back.
