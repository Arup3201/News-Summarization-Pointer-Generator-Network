Beatrice Nokes, pictured, is suspected of grooming three young women to sell their bodies for sex

The daughter of two respected solicitors is accused of running an upmarket vice ring with a Scotland Yard detective.

Beatrice Nokes, 21, faces claims she incited a ring of prostitutes operating out of properties in Central London.

The University College London chemistry student is suspected of grooming three young women to sell their bodies for sex.

She is accused of running the vice ring in the capital last year with 37-year-old Met police officer Daniel Williams.

He faces several further offences including voyeurism and hiding the profits of their activities in socks stuffed up the chimney of his home.

It is understood he is accused of committing the crimes while on and off-duty, using a tablet computer to co-ordinate illicit liaisons while working.

Nokes, a keen horsewoman, artist and charity fundraiser, is the daughter of two highly experienced legal professionals.

Her father, Jonathan Nokes, 66, is a partner at respected law firm Anthony Gold where he specialises in commercial property law.

Her mother, Ceinwen Rowles, 59, specialises in education law, discrimination and complaints and is taking a case to the European Court of Human Rights.

They both accompanied her to Westminster Magistrates’ Court when she went before a judge for the first time last month.

Yesterday, she appeared in the dock alongside Williams at Southwark Crown Court where their cases were formally joined.

The pair, who sat at either end of the dock and did not speak or look at each other, spoke only to confirm their identities.

The both face three charges of ‘causing or inciting’ prostitution ‘in the expectation of gain’ in September and October last year.

Williams faces seven further charges including controlling prostitution for gain in the 10 months up until his arrest by anti-corruption colleagues on October 8.

The detective constable, who is suspended from duty, was based at Tooting police station in Wandsworth, South West London.

He is accused of two counts of misconduct in a public office, firstly by running the prostitution ring and secondly by using police computers to check clients.

A further charge alleges he concealed a ‘large quantity of cash’ by stuffing it in socks and hiding it in the chimney of his Putney home.

Several weeks after he was first arrested Williams was also accused of using high-tech hidden equipment to spy on unsuspecting women hotel guests

He is said to have watched the victims at the Jury’s Inn in Milton Keynes and The Mandolay Hotel, Guildford, Surrey, between January and October last year.

The court heard Williams, who wore a navy suit and purple tie, has been refused legal aid or financial support from the Police Federation.

His barrister Paul Spreadborough said he was working for free for the detective until the legal funding is sorted out.

‘The defendant did the alleged offences while acting as a police officer and faces charges of misconduct in a public office,’ he said.

‘It is to that end that those instructing me were most surprised that the Police Federation have refused his funding on the basis it had nothing to do with police work.’

Williams, of Putney, South West London, and Nokes, of Islington, North London, were both released on conditional bail. They are expected to go on trial later this year.
