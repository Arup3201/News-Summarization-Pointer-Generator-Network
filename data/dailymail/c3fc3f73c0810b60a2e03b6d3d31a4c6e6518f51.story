Former President of France Nicolas Sarkozy has come out along with actor Liam Neeson to support keeping New York City's famous horse-drawn carriages as Mayor Bill De Blasio seeks to ban the industry.

Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni took their young daughter Giulia in one of the carriages for a ride through Central Park on Wednesday.

When asked if he thinks the carriages should stay, Sarkozy offered up an enthusiastic 'yes', the New York Daily News reports.Â

Making a stance: The Sarkozy family's Central Park ride comes at a politically tense moment for the carriage industry, since Mayor Bill De Blasio is trying to get them banned and replaced with vintage cars

The Sarkozys are in town to support singer-songwriter Bruni who is set to perform at The Town Hall Thursday night.

At the end of the ride, Sarkozy chatted for a bit before whisking Giulia away for a shopping spree at FAO Schwartz.

They were joined by more than 900 horse-lovers at the park yesterday where the Daily News was handing out 'Save Our Horses' buttons.

Apple of their eyes: The proud parents doted on little Giulia throughout the ride

Political past: Bruni became the first lady of France in 2008 when she married the then-President Sarkozy. He was elected out of office in May 2012

So far more than 20,000 have signed a petition launched by the newspaper, asking De Blasio not to ban the horses.

Support: Actor Liam Neeson has said carriage horses should stay in the city

While De Blasio wasn't passionate about the cause when he was a member of City Council in 2007, he became the face of a horse-free park in 2011 when he said it was time to pursue 'more humane alternatives to the horse-drawn carriages'.

That statement seems to have helped the mayor when he was running for office last year, and anti-carriage groups funded a serious ad campaign against Christine Quinn - his main Democrat rival.

Actor Liam Neeson, who starred in Shindler's List and Taken, has become one of the horse-drawn carriage industry's main supporters after recently touring a stables where they are housed.

'It has been my experience, always, that horses, much like humans, are at their happiest and healthiest when working,' Neeson wrote in an April 14 editorial in The New York Times.

Neeson believes the horse-carriage business is 'humane' and 'well regulated'.

While four horses have been killed in collisions with motor vechiles, Neeson said that is a remarkably safe record for New York's traffic.

Human rights activists protested outside of Neeson's apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan last Saturday, many holding signs reading 'Liam Neeson: Stop Supporting Cruelty!' and 'Worked to Death!'

Mayor De Blasio plans to replace the carriages with electric vintage-style cars.

Gathering: Protesters waited outside Neeson's Manhattan home on Saturday after the actor said he did not back the proposed ban

Horseless carriage: The electric car, designed to look like a classic motor, is being offered as an alternative to horses in Central Park
