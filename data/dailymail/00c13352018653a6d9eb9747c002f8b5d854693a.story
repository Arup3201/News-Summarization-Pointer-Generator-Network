Packed up neatly, the Princess Mary gift boxes were all ready to be sent to the Tommies in the trenches 100 years ago.

But the cardboard carton containing 80 embossed brass tins in packs of eight was never sent to the Western Front and they remained unopened – until now.

Fittingly, the honour of snipping the string tied round the carton and opening the tins for the first time in a century fell to Lady Emma Kitchener, great-great-niece of Lord Kitchener of Khartoum, the then Secretary of State for War whose mustachioed face and pointing hand were made famous on Britain’s best known First World War recruitment poster.

His face gazed down from one of only four known surviving originals of that poster as Lady Kitchener – with her husband Julian Fellowes, creator of Downton Abbey, by her side – literally lifted the lid on these  poignant pieces of history.

Lady Kitchener agreed to open them at the Daily Mail Chalke Valley History Festival at an event staged by Onslows auctioneers.

The carton was found in Ireland where it was part of a private collection of Great  War memorabilia.

Princess Mary, daughter of King George V, started a Sailors and Soldiers Christmas Fund in November 1914 to give those wearing the King’s uniform and serving overseas on Christmas Day 1914 a ‘gift from the nation’.

At the time, it was expected the war would be over by early 1915.

History box: The 80 embossed Princess Mary brass tins were found to contain a pencil made from a .303 shell case and a printed note from Princess Mary

Previous examples of the tins have contained cigarettes, boiled sweets, chocolate and a pencil made from a .303 shell case along with a printed note reading: ‘With best wishes for a victorious New Year from the Princess Mary and friends at home.’

Those opened at the festival in Wiltshire on Saturday only contained the pen and note.

Experts said other items would have been added later to suit individual  recipients – for example, non-smokers would get sweets rather than cigarettes. It is not known why the carton was never sent.

After opening the boxes, Lady Kitchener, a former lady-in-waiting to Princess Michael of Kent, told the Mail: ‘It was really extraordinary – a really, really moving experience, and I was tremendously honoured, and humbled actually, at doing such a thing.

‘The smell as I opened them was a mixture of sawdust and damp … and funnily enough, Julian said, of his grandmother’s drawing room.’

She added: ‘It was perhaps the very first time the soldiers who received these boxes were away from home … to be in the trenches in all that discomfort and being so frightened, you can’t imagine what that was like.

‘So to get a little present like that from Princess Mary was thrilling and I’m sure unexpected as well.’

Patrick Bogue, of Onslows, said the boxes would be offered for sale for £300 each, with 10 per cent of proceeds going to military charities.

Mr Bogue added that he had thought there were only three of the Kitchener recruitment posters – until Lady Kitchener remarked that she had one too..
