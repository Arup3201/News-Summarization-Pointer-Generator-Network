A California man has become the first passenger to die in a car crash while using the rideshare service Lyft. 

Shane Holland, 24, of West Sacramento and his 27-year-old boyfriend Brady Lawrence ordered a car through the mobile app early Saturday morning while going home from a Halloween party.

Their Lyft driver Shanti Adhikari, 31, swerved in the rain to avoid a stalled car in the center lanes of the freeway and crashed into a tree on the shoulder of the road. Holland died at the scene.

'Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and loved ones involved in this tragedy,' said Lyft spokeswoman Erin Simpson on Sunday. 'We are deeply saddened to hear this news and will continue to support those involved as well as authorities in the ongoing investigation.'

Victim: Shane Holland, 24, died Saturday morning while riding as a passenger in a Lyft rideshare car near Roseville, California 

Damage: Holland and his 27-year-old boyfriend Brady Lawrence were being driven by Lyft driver Shanti Adhikari when the driver swerved to avoid a stalled vehicle in the middle of the road and crashed into two trees on the shoulder. Holland died on impact. Above, pictures of the scene of the crash 

Fast lanes: Just minutes before the Lyft crash, a white-colored car side-swiped the Kia which caused it to stall on this stretch of I-80 pictured above 

The incident happened just before 1:30am on Saturday as Adhikari was driving Holland and Lawrence in his Toyota Camry  westbound on Interstate 80 near Roseville. 

Just minutes before, the driver of a Kia was sideswiped by a white-vehicle, causing his car to stall in the middle of the road. 

Adhikari swerved in the rain to avoid the Kia, and lost control of his vehicle, which veered onto the right shoulder, struck a tree and then spun clockwise to hit another tree. 

Despite the fact that both passengers were wearing seat belts, Holland died on impact. 

Both Adhikari and Lawrence sustained moderate injuries in the crash. The driver told Fox 40 that he was recovering at home and is 'very sad' about the accident. It's unclear whether Lawrence was hospitalized for his injuries. 

So far, no charges have been pressed against any of the drivers in the accident. California Highway Patrol says the investigation is ongoing, but it appears no drugs or alcohol were a factor.

However, CHP spokesman Chard Hertzell says Adhikari was going too fast for the weather conditions. 

'If you're going slower you're gonna be able to see a vehicle stalled out in front of you, especially in wet weather,' Hertzell told Fox.  

Simpson confirmed that this was the first death for the company, which has a $1million liability policy to cover Lyft drivers, passengers and third parties in crashes.

Competitor Uber has not had a similar fatality involving a passenger yet. However, one Uber driver did fatally hit a 6-year-old pedestrian in San Francisco in January. The family of that victim has filed a wrongful death suit, claiming the driver was distracted on his phone, looking at the Uber app, at the time of the crash. Uber maintains the crash was not their fault.

A first: This was the first fatality involving a Lyft passenger. The rideshare program has a $1million liability policy to cover such accidents. Above, a stock image of a Lyft car in San Francisco
