Radamel Falcao is tipped to make his Premier League debut for Manchester United on Sunday against QPR, and will be expected to hit the ground running.

The Colombian hitman has a formidable striking rate across Europe, and was offered a huge wage by Louis van Gaal upon joining on loan from Monaco.

But how has he got on in his first games for his previous clubs? Goals, goals, goals, is the short answer. Sportsmail takes a look at his record.

Louis van Gaal speaks to Radamel Falcao in training on Thursday as the striker prepares for his debut

Manchester United play QPR on Sunday at Old Trafford and the Colombian striker is set to start 

LANCEROS BOYACA, 28 August 1999, Deportivo Pereira, D 2-2

After making his debut aged just 13, it's hard to criticise Falcao for not hitting the ground running in the Colombian second division.

A huge amount of trust was placed in the youngster, and rest assured his first (and only) goal for the club wasn't too far away.

Aged just 14, Falcao netted in the 2-0 win against Club El Condor to lift his club off the bottom of the table. A move to a bigger club beckoned.

RIVER PLATE: 6 March 2005, Instituto Cordoba, W 3-1

Having impressed in the youth ranks for four years, Falcao was finally handed his debut, albeit for four minutes, in a 3-1 win against Instituto Cordoba in the Torneo Clausura.

The 19-year-old had little time to impress alongside such stars in the making as Javier Mascherano and Gonzalo Higuain before bursting into life the following season.

Falcao scored twice against Independiente, Lanus and San Lorenzo, before a knee ligament injury in November ruled him out for six months.

PORTO: 16 August 2009, Pacos de Ferreira, D 1-1

Porto picked up the prolific frontman for just £3.2million (despite the advances of Aston Villa), and he started to deliver straight away.

Replaced Raul Meireles to make his Liga Sagres bow against Pacos de Ferreira and netted in the 78th minute to secure a crucial draw. 

Scored in each of his first four games while forming a lethal partnership with fellow South American Hulk, though his first game on English soil wasn't so successful; a 1-0 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.

ATLETICO MADRID, 10 September 2011, Valencia, L 0-1

Brought in to replace Sergio Aguero, the pressure was truly on the Colombian now, possibly for the first time in his career.

A 1-0 loss to Valencia wasn't the ideal start for the £41m man, but six goals in his next three games would have put fans at ease, and more.

Falcao scored 70 goals in two seasons with Atletico; his reputation as one of the most lethal forwards in the world was secured.

MONACO, 10 August 2013, Bordeaux, W 2-0

Real Madrid were tipped to land the striker, but Falcao elected to sign for Ligue 1 moneybags Falcao, albeit only for a season.

As per usual the 27-year-old started impressively, scoring on his debut against Bordeaux and netting seven in his first seven games for the club.

Monaco were pushing PSG for the title before yet another knee ligament injury, one that he is only just recovering from.

One thing's for sure, United can expect an impact from Falcao. They'll just hope it's with his customary goals, not the injuries.
