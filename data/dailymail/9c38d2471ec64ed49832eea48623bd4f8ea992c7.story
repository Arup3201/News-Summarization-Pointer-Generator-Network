West Ham striker Enner Valencia scored a spectacular goal that seemed to defy physics to equalise for Ecuador during a friendly in the USA.

The 24-year-old’s 88th minute strike appeared to deflect off American Tim Ream however the arcing flight of the ball cleared the defender and past Brad Guzan in goal.

The Aston Villa goalkeeper was completely bamboozled by the strike which denied Landon Donovan a win in his final match for the national side.

Valencia has had a promising start to life at Upton Park and West Ham boss Sam Allardyce will hope the Ecuadorian striker can replicate such magic for the Hammers throughout the season.

Donovan, America’s all-time leading goal scorer, played his 157th and final match for the USA in the 1-1 draw on Saturday.

The American star was given a testimonial to sign off his career after being left out of Jurgen Klinsmann's World Cup squad.
