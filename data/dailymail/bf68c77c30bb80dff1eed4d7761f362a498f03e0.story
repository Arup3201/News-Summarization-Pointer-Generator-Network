A former top secret Second World War and Cold War naval communications base in Wales, used to transmit orders for the sinking of the Bismarck and General Belgrano warships, has been sold to four local investors for regeneration.

Mystery surrounded Criggion station near Welshpool when it was established in 1943, with speculation over its use only ending when its towers were demolished in 2003.

Built during the Second World War, the remote communications hub was rumoured to have been used to keep the Admiralty in contact with Royal Navy ships around the world and to have ordered the sinking of the pride of the German Navy, the Bismarck.

Criggion station, near Welshpool in Wales, was built during the Second World War and used to beam out messages to Royal Navy ships

Orders to sink the Argentine ship The General Belgrano were carried through Criggion, as were orders to sink the Bismarck in 1941

Now the desolate site, once a prime target for a Russian nuclear strike, is earmarked for regeneration.

The site comprises of 11.68 acres of land and four separate buildings. The site was available for purchase as a whole or as separate lots.

Commenting on the sale, Mark Kelly from commercial real estate agents Telereal Trillium said: 'The community showed a strong interest in the site and we are very pleased that the sale has been completed by four local investors.

'We are confident that the regeneration of the lots will bring life back to the area and will directly benefit the immediate community.

'We are committed to bringing the site back into use so that it can once again make a meaningful contribution to the local area. Bid submissions were received from a number of parties, including members of the local community.'

Full details of the sale have not been disclosed, but it has been considered for a variety of uses, including a design studio, industrial storage, conversion to residential buildings and a war museum.

Powys county councillor Graham Brown and members of the local community previously expressed a bid to revamp the old buildings and turn them into a war-related national museum of international importance.

He said: 'You would not believe what went on in these buildings that were linked up to Hawaii and Colorado in the USA.

'Orders to sink the Bismark during World War II came from Criggion and it is believed that Margaret Thatcher's direct order to sink the Argentine ship, the General Belgrano, during the Falklands War was transmitted through Criggion.

'The buildings have been left to decay over the past decade but we want to turn them into a museum exhibition which could have both historical and educational value.

'The project has the potential to bring in tourists and could lead to a major economic regeneration of the area.'

The centre was built during the Second World War amid fears the Germans could bomb the UK's main communications post at Rugby, Warwickshire.

While Criggion was still being tested, a fire knocked out the centre at Rugby, making the Welsh station Britain's foremost naval communications post, sending out orders to our huge fleet of submarines and battleships.

The station was used in ordering the sinking of German battleship Scharnhorst in 1943, seen as huge psychological blow for the German high command and the nation as a whole.

But it was after the Second World War that the station was at its busiest. It became the top-secret hub of Cold War communications and 160 people worked at the site during the tense 1960s, as messages were beamed across the Atlantic during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

As the centre of communications with missile-launching submarines, it was feared the site would be one of the first Russian targets in the event of nuclear war and it soon saw protests by nuclear disarmament campaigners and activists.

The centre remained key to Britain's naval communication right up until the end of the 1990s, but its three 700ft-high radio masts and three 600ft-high towers were demolished in 2003.
