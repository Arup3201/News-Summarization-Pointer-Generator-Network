More than one million Wonga customers have been left confused about whether they are one of the 333,000 borrowers to have their loans written off by the controversial payday lender.

The company announced it would write off £220million in debts after regulatory body, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), revealed it had loaned money to people who could not afford to repay.  

It means that those who have fallen more than 30 days behind with repayments and should never have been given loans will have their debt wiped entirely.

Wonga customers face anxious wait to find out whether they will have their loans written off by payday lender 

While around 45,000 customers who are up to 29 days in arrears will be asked to repay their debt without interest and charges and will be given an option of paying off their debt over an extended period of four months.

But borrowers have been left in limbo after Wonga’s announcement last week when they were told all customers would be contacted to notify them about whether they will be included in the redress programme.

The FCA told the lender, which quotes an annual interest rate of 5,853 per cent, it had to contact those affected by the end of the day yesterday.

One customer told the Guardian he did not know whether he should pay an instalment of his repayment plan or risk accruing more charges if it was deemed he was not entitled to a write-off.

The payday company said yesterday that it had contacted 375,000 customers by email to let them know what they needed to do next and urged them not to involve a third party with their case.

In the email from Wonga to those affected it said the company ‘will automatically clear any outstanding debt you have with us’ by the end of October.

 Wonga's TV adverts, which feature 'pensioner puppets', have been criticised by the Advertising Standards Authority

It added: ‘We recognise that we may not have always made the right lending decisions and for this we apologise. We intend to be sure in the future that we only lend to customers who can afford to repay the loans’.

Customers were also advised they ‘do not need to do anything’.

Wonga is expected to contact the remainder of its one million customers to let those that have not been affected that that is the case. 

However regulator FCA said there is no set timeframe for this, but it is anticipated it will be done as quickly as possible. 

However some borrowers who say they were over the 30-day arrears period have taken to online forums after they did not hear from the payday lender.

'Vicarondo' posted on the Money Saving Expert forum: 'I never heard a thing either, 197 days in arrears and still they want £1045 off me on a £1000 loan (salary only £1200) have paid £600 back already. Really thought I would be one of the ones to be wiped.'

The user explained to forum members that his financial problems began in November when they missed a couple of payments on a credit file.

They added: 'By March when they lent me the £1000 I would have had lots of late payments on my credit card, next account and on my car payments.'

Vicarondo later updated the thread saying they had rung Wonga and was informed they were not affected by the redress.

Some Wonga customers who expected to receive an email after being over the 30-day arrears period say they have been told by the company that they were not affected by the redress

'When I asked why she said she couldn't tell and didn't know what criteria had been used and then just read me a scripted response really,' they added.

'Wonder why they've deemed me not affected when they lend me 80 per cent of my monthly salary.'

The user has since said they intend to contact the financial ombudsman about the issue.  

Other users said that they were expecting an email from the company, despite the fact their debt had been sold on to a third party.

It comes after the Money Saving Expert reported that Wonga would be handling cases 'even if a customer's debt has been sold on to a third party or they've entered into an individual voluntary arrangement or debt management scheme.'

Forum user 'Brogden' posted: 'Wonga DID sell debts on........mine sold to ARC Europe (Gothia....?) I have heard nothing - no email or anything.'

But Wonga posted on its Twitter page today that the forbearance programme does not include customers whose debt was sold.

Entrepreneur: Mr Damelin founded Wonga in 2007 and it quickly shot to a billion-pound business

The founder of the controversial payday lender Wonga pocketed almost £1million last year despite the firm lending to thousands of people who could not afford to pay their loans back.

Errol Damelin's £970,000 package - up more than a quarter on 2012 - is understood to have included a payoff of almost £700,000 for 'loss of office'. 

South African Mr Damelin's pay was revealed this week in Wonga's annual accounts.

Despite leaving the day-to-day running of the firm in November, as the highest-paid director Mr Damelin is understood to have received a basic package of £273,000 plus a £697,000 payoff - bringing his total pay to £970,000.

By comparison, all of Wonga's other directors put together earned £252,000 last year.

The company added: 'We said at time that we will continue to work with the FCA to see if additional remediation is needed.' 

Other customers have also pointed out that the email issued by the company yesterday had landed in their junk mail folder, which explained why some people who expected to receive correspondence had not yet heard anything.

Paladindc wrote: 'BT/Yahoo spam filters put my email in there [junk mail folder]. Had to go to the email website, as my phone doesn't sync with the spam folder. Was only able to log into it this morning. Made for a long night, but all written off.'

The seven-year-old firm has been criticised for making loans of up to £1,000 in just seconds – usually to people who end up taking out further loans to pay off their debts.

It claimed that for each application an algorithm checked between 6,000 and 8,000 ‘data points’, which was said to be a better indication of borrowers’ ability to pay back a loan than traditional credit checks.

But the FCA said that debt charities and campaigners had supplied information which confirmed claims that Wonga was not properly checking whether its customers could afford the repayments.

The company has now been forced to scrap its affordability check procedure and is developing a new lending criteria, which will be examined by the regulator.

Wonga said it would be accepting significantly fewer loan applications and that some existing customers would no longer be able to use the service.

It has said it expects it will be ‘smaller and less profitable’ in the near term as it carries out the task of cleaning up its reputation. 

In June, Wonga was ordered to pay compensation of £2.6 million by the FCA after sending threatening legal letters from fake law firms to 45,000 customers. 

The regulator said Wonga had been guilty of ‘unfair and misleading debt collection practices’ by creating fake companies to pressure struggling customers into paying their bills. 

The firm, which unlike many payday lenders has its roots in the UK rather than the United States, has around one million customers and a default rate of around 7 per cent on its loans. 

Wonga is one of several payday lenders which recently signed up to a new real-time information sharing service, helping it to make more accurate decisions about who to lend money to. 

Going ahead, Wonga plans to overhaul the image it presents to the public, especially through its advertising, in a way that cuts the risk of it inadvertently attracting the very young or vulnerable. 

 Wonga's cuddly, elderly puppets disappeared from TV screens in July, as Mr Haste said he was ‘very aware’ of criticism of its marketing campaign. 

The firm has no immediate plans to launch a new advertising drive.

Compared: While Wonga's revenues were up by £5million in 2013, their costs increased by almost £50million
