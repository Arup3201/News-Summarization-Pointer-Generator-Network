As a Hollywood legend, Shirley MacLaine could have been forgiven for expecting a wardrobe of new tailor-made costumes when she joined Downton Abbey.

But the Oscar-winning star made her debut in the hit ITV show in a second-hand coat that had already appeared in three other television dramas in 20 years.

More than ten million viewers saw the 78-year-old star of movies including The Apartment and Terms Of Endearment make her flamboyant entrance as Martha Levinson in the first episode of the new series.

Second-hand: Shirley MacLaine makes her Downton Abbey debut in a coat first seen on television in 1994

Welcome back: The familiar coat has made an appearance in at least five television dramas

Her character, a wealthy American socialite, stepped out of a car in an elegant evening coat embroid­ered with a silk and metal thread and topped off with a fur collar and cuffs.

It was a show-stopping arrival – but the dress had already been seen on screen several times.

Firstly, in 1994, the actress Gaye Brown wore it in an episode of the BBC drama The House Of Eliott, which was set in the Twenties.

Three years later it was worn in an ITV adap­tation of Catherine Cookson's The Wingless Bird – a story of love and intrigue in the North East at the ­outbreak of the First World War.

In April, French actress and model Josephine de la Baume wore the coat in ITV's four-part drama Titanic – which was also scripted by Downton Abbey writer Julian Fellowes.

Miss de la Baume's character, the flirtatious Madame Aubert, can clearly be seen wearing it on the deck of the doomed liner.

A week after Miss Mac­Laine donned the coat, it was on screen again – in the BBC's highly acclaimed five-part First World War drama Parade's End.

In that show, Rebecca Hall, 30, who played the beautiful but scheming Sylvia Tietjens, wore it when she visited the front line to confront her husband Christopher, played by Benedict Cumberbatch.

Nigel Stafford Clark, the producer of Titanic, said he had no problem with the fact that Madame Aubert's coat had resurfaced in Downton.

He added: 'I'm delighted it's keeping such exalted company – costumes do get recycled.'

The fashion for reusing clothes is due partly to the fact that drama budgets have become increasingly tight.

In addition, there has been a spate of recent productions set in the years leading up to and immed­iately following the First World War, and a consequent need for clothing to define that era.

Male stars are also having to make do with hand-me-downs. In tonight's episode of Downton Abbey, Kevin McNally, who plays the gruff Horace Bryant, will be seen wearing a scarf previously sported by Rupert Everett in Parade's End.

A spokesman for Downton Abbey said: 'As with all television costume drama, theatre productions and films, a proportion of the costumes will be originally designed and others will be hired.'
