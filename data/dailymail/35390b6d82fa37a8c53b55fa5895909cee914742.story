Mr Webb said the older generation could face 'boredom, loneliness and poverty' as he encourages more elderly to return to the workforce

Britons who haven't planned for their future will be left with nothing but boredom, loneliness and poverty in old age, Pensions Minister Steve Webb has said.

Rather than working for longer, or enjoying the fruits of their labour in their final years, the minister issued a bleak assessment of old age if the elderly did not take steps to secure their futures.

His comments come as he launches the 'Fuller Working Lives' programme which aims to extend flexible working to all employees straight away so older workers can combine employment with caring for relatives.

As the state pension age can start as early as 61, Mr Webb, 48, is 13 years away from reaching it himself.

The warning came in a foreword, written by Mr Webb and employment minister Esther McVey for the government paper.

The foreword states: 'For some, retirement is something to look forward to, something they've worked hard to achieve, a time to spend more time doing more of the things they love: taking up new hobbies, volunteering in the community or simply taking it easy.

'For others, without adequate financial planning, it can become a time of boredom, loneliness and poverty.'

The impact of an aging population and
 falling birth rate means over the next decade there will be 700,000 
fewer people aged 16 to 49 -  but another 3.7milllion people between 50 
and pension age.

Millions of over-50s must be encouraged to stay in the job market with offers of flexible hours and careers advice, ministers say.

Mr Webb said the older generation of workers are a ‘vast untapped talent’ and must be encouraged to stay in employment for longer, or lured back if they have retired early.

He will appoint an older workers’ champion to ‘challenge misconceptions’ about giving jobs to older staff who ministers say could provide a huge boost to the economy.

The ‘Fuller Working Lives’ programme announced will extend flexible working to all employees straight away so older workers can combine employment with caring for relatives.

The government drive to get older people back into the workforce is focusing on women in their 50s who have taken time out of work to help with caring responsibilities, and men in their 50s who have taken sick leave or incapacity benefit from work, who may no longer be able to do their previous job for health reasons

In addition, job centres will pilot courses aimed at retraining older workers, and employers given advice on how to accommodate staff with certain health problems.

A recent survey of 400 McDonald’s restaurants across Britain showed customer satisfaction was on average 20 percent higher when they employed staff aged 60 and over.

Academics found older staff at the chain were more likely to empathise with customers, go the extra mile in serving them, and could use their life experience to help mentor younger staff.

Around 60 percent of people in the UK aged 55 to 64 are in work and the number is growing.

Older workers saw far fewer job losses during the recession in Britain than younger workers did, which experts say is a vote of confidence in their skills and hard work.

But Mr Webb said in some other countries the employment rate for this age group is around 70pc or higher, and believes Britain should aim to raise its game.

‘Older workers have a huge amount to bring to any workforce and are a vast untapped talent’, he said.

‘We
 are living longer and can expect many more years of healthy life. It’s 
great news – but it’s something that as a society and as an economy we 
need to respond to.

‘I am 
determined that we boost our support for older workers and help 
employers challenge outdated perceptions to see the real strengths of 
this important section of the workforce.’

Mr
 Webb is the minister behind the decision in this year’s budget to allow
 people to cash in their pension pot from the age of 55.

Currently they can take a small lump sum when they retire but the rest must be invested in an annuity -  a product which gives pensioners a guaranteed annual income for the rest of their life.

He said having the flexibility to cash in part of their pension while continuing to earn money would also help people have a ‘gradual retirement’.

Two groups of pensioners are at the heart of the government’s drive to get older people back to work.

One is women in their 50s who have taken time out of work to help with caring responsibilities, for their elderly parents or grandchildren, and have found it difficult to return. Mr Webb said they could benefit from more flexible hours.

The second is men in their 50s who have taken sick leave or incapacity benefit from work, who can no longer do their previous job for health reasons but could be retrained to do something else.

Caroline Abrahams of the charity Age UK said the measures were ‘essential’ to stop an older generation, who are living longer, being excluded from work and struggling for money.

She said: ‘Too many older people still find themselves locked out of the workplace despite overwhelming evidence showing they are at least as productive as their younger counterparts and make an invaluable  contribution in terms of their experience, knowledge and skill.

‘Nearly half of all unemployed people aged 50 and over have been out of work for more than a year, with many in this age group finding it incredibly hard to get another job.’

It is already illegal to sack a person for turning 65. The state pension age will rise to 66 from 2018 and to 67 from 2026.
