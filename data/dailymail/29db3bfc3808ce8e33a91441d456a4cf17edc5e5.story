A pharmacy technician who shot his female colleague dead before turning the gun on himself was trying to pursue a romantic relationship with the victim, police have said. 

The 58-year-old suspect, who is yet to have been named, walked into part of the Ben Taub General Hospital complex in Houston, Texas, on Sunday and shot the younger woman several times at point blank range while her back was turned. 

Seven employees and dozens of customers waiting to pick up prescriptions were in the building at the time of the shooting, but no one else was hurt.

Aftermath: A Harris County Medical Examiner's vehicle sits outside the Houston hospital. Seven employees and dozens of customers were inside at the time of the shooting, but no one else was hurt

Police said the victim may have been the man's love interest but had rejected his advances in recent days.

Spokesman John Cannon told Fox News that the pair had worked together for several years, but the man was trying to take the relationship 'to another level'.

'In recent days or weeks, he had tried to enhance their friendship or relationship,' he said. 

According to Click 2 Houston, the victim's back was turned and he never saw gunman coming.

Cannon added: 'She was standing at her work station when the suspect walks by and then is out of her range, she cannot see him and at that time that's when he discharges his weapon.'

George Masi, president and CEO of Harris Health System, which operates Ben Taub, issued a statement that read: 'At this most difficult time, our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the two staff who lost their lives as a result of this senseless violence, as well as to every Harris Health System employee and the members of our medical staff.' 

The hospital was put on lockdown and patients were told to shut their doors, but trauma and emergency services were not impacted.  

Reaction: The hospital was put on lockdown and patients were asked to lock their doors as police attended the scene of the shooting. However the facilities were open as usual just hours later 

Investigation: An officer takes photos outside of the outpatient pharmacy following the shooting 

Love interest: Houston Police Spokesman John Cannon told reporters the pair had worked together for several years, but the man was trying to take the relationship 'to another level'
