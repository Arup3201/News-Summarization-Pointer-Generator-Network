Silviniaco Conti handed trainer Paul Nicholls a remarkable ninth win in the King George VI Chase at Kempton as he dismantled the opposition with a display of clinical and ruthless steeplechasing.

The 15-8 favourite’s former stablemate Kauto Star, a five-time winner of this race and honoured with the unveiling of a statue before racing, produced some brilliant Boxing Day displays.

This was a performance of utter control by Silviniaco Conti which would have been worthy of Kauto Star.

Noel Fehily’s mount jumped with fluency and galloped relentlessly as he drew four-and-a-half lengths clear of Dynaste and a further five from stablemate Al Ferof to win the race for a second year running.

That duo, along with Champagne Fever (fourth), Cue Card (fifth) and Johns Spirit (sixth), were all queuing up on Conti’s tail as the field turned into the home straight. But they had nothing left to give.

The dual Betfair Chase winner had drawn the sting out of them all, like a boxer who pummels his opponent with a repetitive jab on the chin.

The performance made a mockery of the promoter’s not unreasonable efforts to build up this £200,000 contest watched by a crowd of almost 22,000 as one of the most open King George’s ever run.

The victory also enabled the eight-year-old to join an illustrious list of horses to have won back-to-back King George’s, including Pendil, Captain Christy, Silver Buck, The Fellow, Kicking King and Wayward Lad.

Silviniaco Conti followed up last year’s win with a fourth place in the Cheltenham Gold Cup and Nicholls’ aim is now to win that race — a feat he feels would truly place the gelding’s name up with the chasing glitterati.

He also has confidence he can achieve the feat having identified, and cured, the attack of chronic gastric ulcers which he feels were hampering Silviniaco Conti, jointly owned by Chris Giles and Jared Sullivan, last season.

Nicholls, who up until the King George had endured a frustrating day with Saphir Du Rheu falling in the Kauto Star Novices’ Chase and Irving pulling up in the Christmas Hurdle, said: ‘I think this was a career-best effort. I think he is a better horse than he was a year ago. He is a bit stronger.

‘The Cheltenham Gold Cup is now our No 1 target with him. I know why he didn’t perform last year — a few little things that we have put right. We found out he was suffering from gastric ulcers and the cheek-pieces have helped him concentrate a bit more.

‘If we can get him therein this form we have a big chance.’

Fehily added: ‘I think he’s proved what a very good horse he is, whatever the ground. He did it the hard way, he went a real good gallop and picked it up from the bend. He’s just a hell of a good horse.’

On his own record, Nicholls added: ‘I’ll have to go for 10 and make it a round number. I am astounded — it is incredible. It shows we have a good team at home. We are good with these staying chasers. Our set-up suits well. Hopefully, Conti will come back next year.’

King George sponsors William Hill make Silviniaco Conti 7-2 favourite for the Gold Cup, having halved his odds.

The next two in the betting, Bobs Worth (10-1) and reigning champion Lord Windermere (12-1), run in tomorrow’s Lexus Chase at Leopardstown.

Conti is 5-1 to win the King George for a third time next year.

The two-mile Champion Chase seems the more likely target for Al Ferof after he finished third for a second year running under Sam Twiston-Davies. Nicholls added: ‘I would love to run Al Ferof in the Champion Chase. I think he has all the speed in the world. It amazed me he stayed on to be third because he looked beat turning in. His class gets him there.’

And it seems likely Dynaste will try to win a second Ryanair Chase over two miles and five furlongs rather than go for the three and a quarter mile Gold Cup. Trainer David Pipe said: ‘He’s run his heart out. I’m sure he’ll have entries in both races at Cheltenham (Ryanair and Gold Cup), but I’d rather win a Ryanair than be placed in a Gold Cup.’

One wonders if the Ryanair will also be the target of Champagne Fever after his stamina also looked to be running on empty in the final furlong.
