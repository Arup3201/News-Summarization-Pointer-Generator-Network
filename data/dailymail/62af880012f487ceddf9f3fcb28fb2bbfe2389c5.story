It was the explosive storyline that threatened to derail life as we know it in the gentle village of Ambridge.

After a local gamekeeper is brutally murdered, one of the show's best-loved characters Ed Grundy is wrongfully jailed for life for a crime he didn't commit.

Except, as fans of Radio 4's rural soap The Archers know, it never happened.

New storyline: Brian Aldridge (Charles Collingwood, pictured with Tamsin Greig who plays Debbie Travers-Macy) had an affair and child with Siobhan Hathaway in the show instead of the story running the Eddie Grundy miscarriage of justice story

The director of BBC Radio Helen Boaden has revealed that she banned the programme makers from airing the dramatic plot twist because she felt it was too 'far fetched', leaving the show's editor close to tears.

As a result of her executive decision, made in 2002 when she was Radio 4 controller, the show's writers were forced to rewrite a huge swathe of the script.

Instead, they came up with Brian Aldridge's affair and child with Siobhan Hathaway, a storyline that played out over more than a year and boosted the programme's audience figures.

Miss Boaden, who earns £340,000-a-year, said that the proposed plot would have seen Helen Archer's 'deeply boring gamekeeper boyfriend' Greg Turner murdered, and Ed Grundy 'banged up for life a killing he did not commit'.

She said it would have led to a 'long running rough justice story'.

The village of Ambridge in the county of Borsetshire. Its goings on have been followed nationally since 1951

Explaining her decision to can it, she said: 'Murders in country villages by people you have never met are unbelievably rare. And this felt so far fetched that I banned it.

'To the great chagrin of the then editor, who nearly cried.

Vanessa Whitburn was appointed editor of the show in 1992 and stayed in the chair until her retirement in May 2013.

She once commented: 'To be politically correct is really to be moral. It is having a correct moral stance. PC is, in fact, my moral plank.'

Many fans of the show disliked Whitburn and her changes to The Archers - one columnist said that she 'not only turned it into politically correct drivel but totally deprived it of its humour'.

Whitburn told the BBC: 'I do not mind proper criticism, and we have a very intelligent audience out there who love the programme, and I love debating with listeners. What I don't like is cyber-bullying.'

'But as a consequence of my decision, she and her team came up with the brilliant and much more authentic Siobhan and Brian adultery story which gripped Middle England for over a year.'

Eventually, Greg Turner was killed off in a different way, when he committed suicide in a 2004 episode.

Miss Boaden contrasted the Archers - which is billed as the 'everyday story of country folk' - with more violent TV soaps such as EastEnders.

Discussing the eventual confrontation between Brian Aldridge and his wronged wife, she said: 'In EastEnders resolving this issue of love and loyalty would have involved a lot of shouting and possibly some violent crime.

'In The Archers, such things are decided over the washing up.'

In recent years, The Archers has been accused of introducing ever-more violent and dramatic plot lines - including bloody accidents and violent gangs - in a bid to increase ratings.

Last year, former EastEnders producer Sean O'Connor took over the long-running show and promised to deliver 'Shakespearean' plots.

Violence is not new in Ambridge - in 1957 Tom Forrest (Bob Arnold), the gamekeeper, shot  Bob Larkin (Lewis Gadge), a poacher
