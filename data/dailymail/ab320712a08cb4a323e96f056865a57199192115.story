World Cup-winning Germany forward Andre Schurrle has dismissed suggestions that he could be on his way out of Chelsea.

The 24-year-old, signed from Bayer Leverkusen 18 months ago, has been underwhelming for Chelsea since returning from Brazil 2014 with a winners' medal, sparking suggestions he could be offloaded in January.

Schurrle, though, has taken to social networking site Instagram to show his allegiance.

'To the top:)) £behappy £blues,' Schurrle posted on Instagram, alongside a photo of him in a Chelsea shirt, pointing to the skies.

Schurrle has completed 90 minutes only twice this term under Jose Mourinho, each time in the Capital One Cup, and the Portuguese has often demanded more of the pacey forward.

Mourinho hinted at his frustrations with Schurrle in early October, after the German had missed a host of chances against Bolton and a key opportunity in the Champions League clash at Sporting Lisbon.

Mourinho said on October 3: 'Sometimes he plays phenomenal. Other times plays so-so. But when he plays phenomenal, he is phenomenal.'

Schurrle will be hoping Mourinho, who substituted him at half-time of the Champions League draw at Maribor last week, can help him to overcome what he will hope is merely a post-World Cup lull.

Mourinho is always seeking more from the Blues, who lead the Barclays Premier League after an unbeaten 11-game start and are eight points clear of defending champions Manchester City.

Like Schurrle, Didier Drogba has had a bit-part role this term.

Drogba, who is 37 in March, has hinted this season could be his last, after returning to Chelsea following a two-year absence and stints in China and Turkey.

The striker was always a stop-gap solution for Mourinho, who views Drogba's influence off the field as significant as the role the Ivorian plays on it.

'This year, the key for me is to enjoy my football and to be with my team-mates and to win trophies,' Drogba told Chelsea TV.

'There is one more year to go so let's do it, let's win more trophies, let's make history again.'

Drogba will always be remembered by Chelsea fans, having struck the decisive penalty in the 2012 Champions League defeat of Bayern Munich which earned Chelsea a first European Cup.

He has made 13 appearances this season, the majority off the substitutes' bench, and netted three goals, to take his overall Chelsea tally to 160.
