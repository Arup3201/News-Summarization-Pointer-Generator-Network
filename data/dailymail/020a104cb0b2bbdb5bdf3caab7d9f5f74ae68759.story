Michelle Obama encouraged rural Chinese students not to let humble beginnings stop them from aiming high, as she spoke during a visit to a school in southwestern China today.

Mrs Obama drew from her experiences, speaking of how she did not let her own modest upbringing in Chicago stand in the way of completing a law degree at Harvard, as she addressed students in remote Chinese communities via webcam.

The First Lady quoted her own mother Marian Robinson, who is accompanying her and her daughters on the trip, saying that ‘a good education is something that no one can take away from you.’

Tiger mother: Michelle Obama had the opportunity to practices Tai chi with students at Chengdu No. 7 High School during her visit in Chengdu, Sichuan province today

One step at a time: The First Lady of the U.S. is given instructions by a tai chi teacher in the grounds of the school in Chengdu

Mrs Obama did not let her kitten heels and dress stop her from taking part in the tai chi session as she mentally prepared herself before speaking to students from across the province about overcoming humble beginnings

The First Lady’s speech, on the last 
leg of a six-day, three-city tour of China, was delivered to a stadium 
of 700 students at a high school in Chengdu, Sichuan province, as well 
as to 12,000 rural students through satellite-enabled distance-learning 
technology.

Mrs Obama cited 
herself, basketball star LeBron James and Starbucks’ CEO Howard Schultz 
as examples of people with modest backgrounds who have succeeded in life
 during her 15-minute presentation at Chengdu No. 7 High School in 
Sichuan province.

‘Because 
in America, we believe that no matter where you live or how much money 
your parents have, or what race or religion or ethnicity you are, if you
 work hard and believe in yourself, then you should have a chance to 
succeed,’ she said.

‘You 
see, the truth is that I grew up like many of you. My mom, my dad, my 
brother and I, we lived in a tiny apartment in Chicago.

‘My father worked at the local water plant and we didn't have much money, but our little home was bursting with love.’

So how do we do this?

Makign friends: The week-long trip to China, during which Mrs Obama is accompanied by her two daughters Sasha and Malia and her own mother, the First Lady is focusing on education and building non-political bridges between China and the U.S.

She
 said persevering was not easy, but added that ‘whenever I got tired or 
discouraged, I would just think about how hard my parents were working 
for me. And I would remember something my mother always told me — she 
said, “A good education is something that no one can take away from 
you.”‘

As her visit to China
 comes to a close, Mrs Obama stuck to her promise of not addressing any 
complex political issues during her stay, and instead promoting cultural
 exchange and education.

White
 House representatives hope that the visit, during which Mrs Obama is 
accompanied by her daughters Sasha, 12, and Malia, 15, as well as her 
mother Marian Robinson, will build non-political bridges between China 
and the U.S.

‘We can start 
with some soft issues to push for more engagements between China and the
 United States,’ said Zhao Kejin, professor of international relations 
of Tsinghua University.

Access
 to education remains a major challenge for Chinese students in rural, 
remote and often impoverished communities, where per-student funding is 
usually a fraction of that in urban schools. Far fewer rural students 
can make it to top-notch Chinese colleges than their urban peers.

The
 elite high school in Chengdu — where most of its graduates pursue 
college education in prestigious Chinese universities or overseas — also
 has a reputation for using technology to bring quality education to 
impoverished remote regions.

The
 speech was followed with a question-and-answer session with 58 students
 in a classroom and 20,000 more students piped in via satellite 
technology. She later observed a student demonstration of the 
traditional Chinese exercise regime tai chi and tried a few moves.

Inspirational: Mrs Obama told students to aim high and get a good education despite humble roots during a 15-minute presentation at Chengdu No. 7 High School in Sichuan province on Tuesday

Encouraging: Michelle Obama used her own modest background and subsequent journey towards a law degree at Harvard as an example of succeeding under adverse conditions, during her presentation

Mrs.
 Obama has largely avoided thorny, political issues on her China trip, 
although she made a strong statement on behalf of free expression, 
choice of religion and unfettered access to information as ‘universal 
rights,’ during a speech Saturday at the Stanford Center at Peking 
University in Beijing.

China
 has some of the world's tightest restrictions on Internet discourse. 
Mrs. Obama's remarks did not call out China directly and have not drawn 
any governmental protest. But that part of her speech has been kept out 
of all official Chinese media reports.

On Tuesday, she once again stressed how Americans value the freedoms of speech and belief.

‘We
 also believe that everyone is equal, and that we all have the right to 
say what we think and worship as we choose, even when others don't like 
what we say or don't always agree with what we believe,’ Mrs. Obama 
said.

While in Beijing, the 
first lady visited an elite high school, where more than 30 American 
students are studying as exchange students, and she held a private 
discussion with a handful of Chinese professors, students and parents.

Mrs.
 Obama met with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday, before Xi flew 
to The Hague for a nuclear security summit and held a meeting with 
President Barack Obama on Monday. She spent a full day with Xi's wife 
Peng Liyuan earlier Friday, in what many Chinese analysts described as 
‘first lady diplomacy’ to help soften the US-China relationship.

Accompanied
 by her mother and daughters, Mrs. Obama has toured the former Imperial 
Palace, the Great Wall in Beijing, and the Terra Cotta Museum in the 
ancient city of Xi'an.

She is schedule to visit a panda research center and lunch at a Tibetan restaurant Wednesday before departing for Washington.
