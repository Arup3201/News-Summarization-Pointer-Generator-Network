Hypocrite? Rob Zombie and his wife Sheri have complained to Connecticut town officials that a skate park is too noisy

Hard rocker Rob Zombie, 48, has been forced to issue a statement saying he is not anti-children after complaining about a 'noisy' skate park near his Connecticut home.

In a move widely condemned as 'hypocritical', Zombie's wife Sheri told an annual town meeting the pair considered the Hollow Park Skatepark - used mainly by young boys - to be 'a significant noise pollutant.'

Zombie is a heavy metal performer known for high-decibel songs including 'Scum of the Earth' and 'Living Dead Girl'.

At last month's Litchfield County town
budget meeting, Sheri told officials the 
'obnoxious' noise had reduced the quality of life for about four families 
nearby, according to minutes published by Gawker.

'There are only three of four homes 
affected by it, but now that summer’s here and the windows are open, I 
hear it inside my house, which is the further point away from the park 
and there’s something that has got to be done,' she said. 

However the park's founders say the kid-friendly 
hangout has already had its 
hours cut back because of the Zombies. 

It prompted young skaters to create their own YouTube video calling for more funding for the park.

'We petitioned and raised funds for 
two years to get the skate park built in Woodbury,' park co-founder Amanda Klimak told Gawker.

'It is now in full operation and the 
kids are loving it, however, now the hours have been cut significantly 
to keep a very famous neighbor happy.'

The park's founders say the park's hours are very restricted following previous complaints made by the Zombies

NBC noted the irony of the noise complaint coming from a man who is headlining the Rockstar Energy Drink Mayhem Festival.

Furious at the 'unfair' media attention, Zombie (real name Robert Bartleh Cummings) turned to Facebook to clarify his position on children and skate parks.  

'It seems nuts to even have to address this but I guess I will. Some really crazy articles have popped up making claims about 'hating skaters' and 'hating children.' None of this is true and it makes me sick that someone would print such lies,' the singer wrote.

'There is a simple matter going on in which we are trying to find a solution that will make EVERYBODY happy. Unfortunately someone decided to turn it into a whole ugly event. What a bummer.'

It is understood the Zombies don't have children.
