A young mother who believed she was having a heart attack was taken to hospital where staff told her to call 999 before they would treat her.

Becky Evans-Woodward went to her nearby 'walk-in' minor injuries and illness unit after her heart starting racing.

Already having suffered five heart attacks she thought she was having another and was taken to the Wycombe Hospital in Buckinghamshire, by her concerned husband rather than waiting for an ambulance.

However, when they arrived staff said she had not been referred to them by a doctor or been brought in by an ambulance and they could not accept her as a patient.

Her husband Alvin was advised to go outside and dial 999 for an ambulance.

The pair remained outside waiting for paramedics who immediately treated the 33-year-old before taking her back into the hospital where she had been refused treatment minutes earlier.

Mrs Evans-Woodward’s husband said he was trying to get his wife the fastest treatment possible and felt calling an ambulance to their remote home, in the village of Great Missenden, would take too long.

Mrs Evans-Woodward has already suffered five heart attacks, one serious, in 2008 and has problems with a blocked artery which leads to her heartbeat unexpectedly rising sharply.

Mr Evans- Edwards instead took her to Wycombe Hospital where there is a cardiac unit.

Staff at the minor injuries unit refused to admit her and suggested she go to Stoke Mandeville Hospital 15 miles away for a ECG examination.

Mr Evans- Woodward, 44 years, said: 'I couldn’t believe it. There are so many procedures.

“I said "Why don’t you just cut the red tape and give me the referral otherwise my wife is going to die".'

Having been told to call an ambulance the couple waited in the hospital’s ambulance bay for the paramedics to arrive.

He said they looked 'slightly flummoxed' by the situation but took her into a hospital corridor to treat her.

Mrs Evans-Woodward said: 'Somebody at some stage, with the way it is going, is going to die because they haven’t had the urgent treatment they need and I don’t want to be the first.' 

Wycombe MP Steve Baker raised the Evans-Woodward case in Parliament this week after being turned away from the hospital on November 5.

He told the Commons that the incident betrayed the principle that the NHS cares for its patients but also the norms of ordinary decent humanity.

'This is not good enough,' he said.

'This is not good enough,' he said.

'It is an appalling prioritisation of bureaucracy oversimple human care and compassion.'

Health minister Daniel Poulter, replied: 'Clearly the care that the constituent received was more than sub-standard.

'If a patient needs immediate treatment, they should always receive it.'

A spokesman for Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust said: 'We can confirm that we have received a complaint from the patient about the services at Wycombe Hospital and are currently jointly investigating it.

'We would like an opportunity to meet the patient and discuss what happened in person.

'Both organisations take the quality of patient care extremely seriously and id we have fallen short in this case then we offer our apologies.

'We also seek to learn from out mistakes and have already made improvements to our services.'

Wycombe Hospital’s minor injuries and illness unit is a joint venture between Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust and GP-led organisation Bucks Urgent Care.
