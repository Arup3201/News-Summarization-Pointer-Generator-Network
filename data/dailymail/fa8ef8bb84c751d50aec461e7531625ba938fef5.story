Anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela left hospital today after 'successful' medical tests and returned to his home in Johannesburg.

The 94-year-old former president and anti-apartheid leader was admitted to a hospital in Pretoria, the capital, yesterday, to undergo tests 'in line with his age.'

'The doctors have completed the tests,' presidential spokesman Mac Maharaj said in a statement.

'He is well and as before, his health remains under the management of the medical team.'

Maharaj appealed to the public and media to respect the privacy of Mandela and his family.

The African National Congress, South Africa's ruling party, had earlier released a statement saying it believed Mandela was in 'capable and competent hands'.

Routine: Nelson Mandela was admitted to hospital in Pretoria for 
routine tests and there was said to be 'no cause for concern'

Mr Mandela was hospitalised at the end of last year and he was airlifted on December 8
 from his rural village in the south of the country to a hospital in 
Pretoria for a series of tests.

Doctors found the former president 
and hero of the anti-apartheid struggle had a recurrent lung infection 
and had developed gallstones.

He underwent surgery to remove the gallstones on December 15 and remained in hospital until December 26.

At that time Mr Zuma had sought to calm jitters over Mr Mandela's health.

'I have been informed that at his age
 doctors need to intervene in a very gradual and sensitive way in order 
to maximise the chances of a full recovery,' he said.

'Madiba is an
 unparalleled fighter and has always been so. He has met all his health 
challenges with his tremendous fortitude and grace.'

The Nobel peace laureate has a long 
history of lung problems dating back decades to when he contracted 
tuberculosis while in jail as a political prisoner.

He was previously admitted to hospital
 for an acute respiratory infection in January 2011, when he was kept as
 an inpatient for two nights.

Under South Africa's white-minority 
apartheid regime, Mandela spent 27 years in prison before he was 
released in 1990. He became the nation's first democratically elected 
president in 1994 under the banner of the African National Congress. He 
served one five-year term before retiring.

The anti-apartheid leader is 
particularly susceptible to illness because of his age and his 27 years 
in prison, though medics said he responded well to treatment.

He fought off a similar lung infection in 2011 and once contracted tuberculosis while imprisoned.

Medical experts have said that respiratory 
illnesses like pneumonia striking a man his age are a serious matter 
that require care and monitoring.

His last hospitalisation 
had caused concern in South Africa, a nation of 50 million 
people that largely reveres him for being the nation's first 
democratically elected president who sought to bring the country 
together after centuries of racial division.

Public concern: When Mandela was last hospitalised in December broadcast vans parked near the 1 Military Hospital eager for updates on his condition

Security: South African military police officers checked cars entering the 1 Military Hospital last year when Mr Mandela was hospitalised

In January 2011, Mr Mandela was 
admitted to a Johannesburg hospital for what officials initially 
described as tests but what turned out to be an acute respiratory 
infection.

The chaos that followed his stay at 
that public hospital, with journalists and members of the public surrounding it 
and entering wards, saw the South African military take charge of his 
care and the government control the information about his health. 

The Nobel laureate last made a public appearance on a major stage when South Africa hosted the 2010 World Cup football tournament. 

Although South Africa today struggles with poverty and inequality, Mandela is widely credited with helping to avert race-driven chaos as South Africa emerged from apartheid.
