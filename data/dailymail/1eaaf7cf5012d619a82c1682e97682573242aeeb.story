Democratic congressional candidate Sean Eldridge has released his latest financial report showing that he put in a quarter of a million dollars in his quest to be elected to office.

While Eldridge's millionaire husband Chris Hughes, who was one of Mark Zuckerberg's college roommates and an early leader at Facebook, is not listed as a donor in the latest filing, plenty of the couple's famous friends chipped in.

Zuckerberg contributed the maximum amount of $2,600 in both the primary and the general election, as did his wife Priscilla Chan meaning that the Zuckerberg-Chan household contributed a total of $10,400 to the New York state campaign.

Capital New York notes that Other famous donors include music producer David Geffen who contributed $2,600 and California-based talent agent Bob Gersh who gave $1,000.

The 27-year-old is running to represent a district in upstate New York but that does not mean that many of his big-money donors are his neighbors in the rural farming town of Shokan.

Instead there are a number of donors based in Manhattan, who live near Hughes and Eldgridge in the SoHo apartment.

In addition to neighbors, there are some other New York personalities who have decided to lend their name- financially, at least- to the cause including Project Runway judge Tim Gunn who gave $1,000 and Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner who donated $5,200.

The biggest donor by far was Mr Eldridge himself who gave $250,000 to the campaign in the third quarter of this year.

His personal payout does not come as a significant surprise to those who have been following the couple's rise to prominence as Mr Hughes is believed to have a personal net worth of around $500million.

Power players: Eldridge has been making a name for himself in political circles, seen here with New Jersey Senatorial candidate Cory Booker, Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, who owns the New York Observer

Sleek: Their latest property- a $2million two-bedroom in Shokan- means that they are residents of New York's 19th District and on Sunday Eldridge announced his candidacy in the Congressional race for that area

His campaign went on to explain that the number he donated is seen as a match to the donations he has received from others.

'Unlike most campaigns, I will not accept donations from corporate PACs. Voters in NY-19 deserve an independent representative who will stand up to Big Oil and Big Banks and do whatâ€™s right for middle class families in our region,' Mr Eldridge said in a press statement when the filing was released.

The two political action committees that contributed to Mr Eldridge's warchest were New York Senator Kirsten Gilibrand's and Congressman Joe Kennedy's.

Mrs Gilibrand has been a friend of Eldridge's for some time and attended his wedding to Mr Hughes in July of last year.
