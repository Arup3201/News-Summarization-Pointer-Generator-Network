A teenager died in a river after jumping in to try and save her school friend who also drowned, an inquest has heard.

Tonibeth Purvis, 15, was trying to rescue Chloe Fowler, 14, after she got into trouble in a stretch of the River Wear, in Fatfield, Washington, in July.

But both girls were swept away and their bodies were found later by emergency crews.

The inquest today heard the traumatic deaths of the two schoolgirls touched the whole community.

Search: Dozens of emergency service workers were called to the scene, including specialist dive teams, the fire brigade, a helicopter and 40 police officers

Miss Purvis, from Barmston, Washington, Tyne and Wear, was hailed a hero after diving in to try and save Miss Fowler, from Shiney Row.

The inquest heard that, during the prolonged rescue attempt, various members of the public tried in vain to save the girls.

An off-duty police officer dived into the water in a bid to rescue the girls while others who helped included two local fishermen, as well as some of the teenagersâ€™ friends.

There were also dozens of emergency service workers at the scene, including specialist dive teams, the fire brigade, a helicopter and 40 police officers.

community.

'Chloe jumped 
into the water and got into difficulty. Then Tonibeth in a valiant 
attempt to try and save her also got into difficulty.

'Both were overwhelmed by the river and drowned despite the efforts of friends and the rescue services.

'I am so very sad about your loss.'

Detective Inspector Mark Ord of Northumbria Police described the timeline of events.

He said the initial report came in just before 3pm, but Tonibeth was not located until 8.49pm and then Chloe at 9.57pm.

'Both girls were found within 100 metres of where they were last seen,' he said.

'The river was in full flow and was a hazardous environment. It was six metres deep in the middle.

'We tried desperately to find the girls.'

The hearing at Sunderland Civic Centre heard that since the incident the local authority has agreed to conduct weekly checks along the river, which rises and falls quickly with the tide.
