A mother-of-six who was beaten, bound and stabbed while being kept prisoner by her estranged husband feared he would behead her during the three day ordeal.

June Churchill was held hostage by David Churchill after he burst into their marital home wielding an axe and armed with a bag of cable ties to keep her prisoner.

He kept her in the house for three days, slashing her throat and even sending text messages to her children pretending to be her, before he set fire to their Merseyside home.

The violent 52-year-old had been released on bail just a few hours before and ordered to stay away from the marital home after being arrested for grabbing his wife by the throat.

'It was like a horror movie,' said Mrs Churchill, a former florist. 

'I felt like I was going to die. There was so much blood running from my chest and my neck.

'The shock numbed the pain but I could feel my life draining away.

'I thought my time was up - he could have killed me at any moment.'

Mrs Churchill was left with black eyes, several wounds to her chest arm and fractured skull and chest bones.

Mrs Churchill described being bound to the bed with cable ties and her estranged husband standing over her, an axe in his hand, saying 'OK, we can do it the easy way - or the hard way.'

He then stabbed her in the chest with the axe, leaving a gaping four-inch wound. 

After reeling off a 'shopping list' of the harm he was to inflict on his estranged wife Churchill then moved her into the bathroom where he slashed her neck.  

After pleading with Churchill to stop, June was moved back to the bedroom and had her wounds patched up with T-shirts in an attempt to stem the bleeding.

He used her phone to send messages to her children reassuring them she was OK. 

In the early hours of October 3 she was then moved downstairs and into a waiting taxi.

Churchill, who has a history of violence, covered the house in white spirit and then set fire to it. 

He drove the 52-year-old to the Royal Liverpool hospital, dropping her off outside and warning her not to tell anyone about what had happened.

Just a day before he burst into the marital home Churchill had been bailed by magistrates after he was arrested by police for grabbing his wife by the throat, holding her in a headlock, strangling her and punching her in the face.

Mrs Churchill's daughter Rachel, 25, said: 'The doctors said it was one of the worst cases they'd ever seen. They couldn't believe she actually survived.

'She had two black eyes, six deep wounds to her chest, neck and arm, her skull and chest bone were fractured. It's remarkable the recovery she's made.'

At a hearing at Liverpool Crown Court Churchill admitted assault, wounding with intent and unlawful imprisonment.

He also admitted arson with intent to endanger lives and has been warned he faced a prison sentence. 

Insurers refused to pay out after her estranged husband burned down their marital home in Maghull, Liverpool

Mr Churchill doused the house in white spirit before he set fire to it and dropped off his wife at the hospital 

Insurers have since agreed to pay £5,000 as a 'goodwill gesture' after the £230,000 house was torched 

Mrs Churchill, who is now being looked after by her daughter at a house in Tuebrook, said she now wants to stop other women becoming victims of domestic violence.

She said: 'In a macabre sort of way, he doesn't realise what he has given me.

'He's given me purpose, because I will make sure what I've been through never happens to anyone else.

'I'm just so lucky I am alive.' 

And in a final bitter blow she has lost her £230,000 semi-detached home as her insurers refused her claim for the house and £15,000 worth of contents because the fire had been started by her husband, who lived at the property in Maghull in Merseyside.  

Esure initially refused to pay out 'on account of Mr Churchill deliberately setting fire to his own property. The company has now offered a 'goodwill gesture' of £5,000, the Daily Mirror reported.
