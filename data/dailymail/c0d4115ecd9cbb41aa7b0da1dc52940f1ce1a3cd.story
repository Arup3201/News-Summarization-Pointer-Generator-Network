Frail: Warren Jeffs, pictured here in 2011, was recently described as looking frail and he was hospitalized over the weekend

Polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs has been hospitalized as he serves life in prison.

Jeffs, 58, is now listed as being treated in a hospital by the Texas Department of Justice's website but no further details about his condition have been reported.

He has been transferred to a hospital in Galveston, Texas, and the update in the online registry was made Sunday.

This is the second time that he has been hospitalized since his 2011 sentencing. The first time he was a result of lengthy hunger strikes that left him in a medically induced coma.

The last-known interview with Jeffs came last month during a deposition in a child custody case and he was described as looking ill during that interaction.

The Salt Lake Tribune reported that a lawyer at the deposition described Jeffs as 'frail and pathetic' as he sat in a cage during the session.

Jeffs is in jail after being convicted on two counts of the sexual assault of two girls- ages 12 and 15- who he claimed were his spiritual wives.

After the jury deliberated for 30 minutes in the case, he was sentenced to life in prison plus 20 years which will be served consecutively.

He will be eligible for parole in 2038.

The deposition comes in connection to a child custody case filed by a former member of The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, the group that Jeffs founded.

Lorin Holm has filed the suit because when he left the sect in 2011- which he described as a voluntary move but is also believed to have been encouraged and forced by Jeffs- Mr Holm's minor children were left in the care of Jeffs.

Mr Holm fears that his children are at risk of being sexually assaulted by the group's leaders and he is now fighting to be given custody.

In spite of his frail condition, Jeffs was accused of still being the de-facto leader of his controversial sect.

The Department of Justice filed a civil-rights motion in November against Colorado City and Hildale, Utah, which claims that the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, of which Jeffs is the president, runs both town's and not the elected leaders.

As part of the lawsuit, fawning letters sent by Colorado City Mayor George M. Allred to Jeffs, 57, were filed that claim to reveal how the shamed polygamous religious leader was asked for advice on who to appoint as new police chief for the town and is even assumed to have a supernatural ability to speak to God.
