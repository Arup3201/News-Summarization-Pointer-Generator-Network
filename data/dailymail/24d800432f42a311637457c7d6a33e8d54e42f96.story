Ear biter: Alexis Santiago, 24, bit another man's ear off and fled seven blocks before being arrested by the police in Immokalee, Florida

A homeless man in Immokalee, Florida took a note from Mike Tyson's book when he started a fight with another man in a supermarket.

The victim, Rotilio Carranza told Collier County deputies that he was eating in the Azteca store on May 23 when 24-year-old Alexis Santiago started a fight.

Carranza told deputies that he didn't even know Santiago.

When Carranza tried to leave, Santiago attacked him eventually biting off his ear.

When police arrived at the scene, Carranza was holding a blood-soaked towel to his head, with the upper part of his ear detached.

According to investigators, Santiago ran from the scene for seven blocks before being apprehended and arrested.

Santiago is being charged with aggravated battery and resisting arrest.

Carranza was taken to Physician's Regional Hospital where his ear is being treated.

Scene of the crime: The Azteca store In Immokalee, Florida, where Rodriguez bit off Carranza's ear. The two were strangers

Going for the ear is apparently an effective move, since there were several cases this month where victims had their ears chomped off.

A verbal altercation in the parking lot of Diane's Second Chance Saloon in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, turned into a physical fight in the bar. Eventually one man bit the other man's ear off and fled before police arrivedÂ 

Mind your own business: A man trying to break up a couple's dispute ended up getting part of his ear bitten off by the boyfriend outside of the above bar in Oak Creek, Wisconsin

Crime of passion: Twymon Arnold bit off his ex-girlfriend's ear while holding her captive for two hours in his car in Greenville, North Carolina

In Boone, North Carolina, on May 17, a 26-year-old man had a portion of his ear bitten off when he intervened in a couple's spat outside of a bar.

The boyfriend, 22-year-old Michael Vann McDuffie, didn't react well to the interruption.

He attacked the man outside of the Char Restaurant and Bar, punching him and eventually biting off part of his ear, according to the Boone Police Department.

Another case in North Carolina involved a man biting off his ex-girlfriend's ear.

The two had gotten into a fight in the parking lot of the Pactolus school in Greenville on May 19, when 39-year-old Twymon Arnold took the woman and held her captive in his car.

She was held against her will for up to two hours, resulting in Arnold biting off part of her ear.

Eventually police arrived and released his girlfriend, who was actually able to drive herself to the hospital for treatment, where she told WCNT news reporters she was doing fine.
