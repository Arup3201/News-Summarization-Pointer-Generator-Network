A man who beat a church organist to death as he made his way to Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve has been told he will serve at least 25 years in prison.

Jonathan Bowling, 22, who admitted murdering Alan Greaves, 68, in the High Green area of Sheffield as the pensioner was on his way to play at the service last Christmas, was handed a life sentence today.

His step-brother Ashley Foster, also 22, was sentenced to nine years at Sheffield Crown Court today for the manslaughter of Mr Greaves.

Mr Greaves’s widow, Maureen, said she was 'happy' with the sentences.

Outside court she said: 'I really am extremely pleased with the result today.

'To think Ashley’s got nine years is the very best we could have got in the circumstances of the manslaughter.

'To think that Jonathan’s got 25 minimum and to think he’ll probably never come out, I really am wonderfully pleased with the result.'

She told reporters she would not read a letter Bowling had written to her.

'To put it into my hands the days he was going to get sentenced, I didn’t think it was very appropriate,' she said.

'If he was going to write me a letter he should have written it a long time ago.'

'Soul mate': Bowling and Foster left Mr Greaves with injuries similar to those suffered by car crash victims when they set upon him with a pick-axe handle in Sheffield

The court heard that Foster and Bowling had left a family gathering earlier on the evening of Christmas Eve last year.

According to prosecutors, they were angrily stalking the streets of High Green looking for someone to attack. If they had not killed Mr Greaves, a retired social worker, it would have been someone else, the jury was told.

Senior police officers said the pair were simply out 'looking for trouble'. 

Prosecutor Robert Smith QC told the court today: 'It was a crime without motive.

'He was killed for no reason other than that he had been identified as a suitable victim.'

Earlier today, the court heard how Bowling of Carwood Way, Pitsmoor, Sheffield, has a number of convictions for violence dating back to his teens.

In 2005 he head-butted a 48-year-woman after she complained about him throwing snowballs at her windows.

A year later, when he was 15-years-old, he was given a two year detention order after he attacked a jogger in Chapeltown, Sheffield, leaving his victim with serious head injuries, including a suspected broken cheekbone.

Bowling was then convicted for brandishing a hammer when a police officer stopped him then threatening a woman with a hammer in a separate incident.

In 2008 he and a girl pinned a 14-year-old boy to the floor before he kicked and punched the teenager in the ribs.

The court heard he had served a number of detention orders in relation to these offences.

Foster, of Wesley Road, High Green, had no previous convictions for violence.

Foster and Bowling, who were both unemployed, had known each other since their early teens when Bowling's father was in a relationship with Foster's mother. They have been described as step-brothers.

Mr Greaves was a social worker for 35 years before he retired about eight years ago. He and Mrs Greaves had been married for 40 years and have four children and two grandchildren.

He was devoted to music and the church - playing the organ at different services around Sheffield - and also singing in choirs.

Mr Greaves took part in a range of other community activities, including playing piano in the local primary school, serving as a school governor, helping in a charity shop and even launching a food bank for people in High Green.

The sentencing came after Mr Greaves' heartbroken widow Maureen Greaves refused to condemn her husband's killers.

Committed Christian Mrs Greaves, 63, 
said she had no feelings of 'hate' towards the men behind the senseless 
attack on her husband - who she described as her 'soul mate' - and 
instead insisted she would pray for Bowling and Foster.

She told of her hope that 'God's great mercy will inspire them to true repentance'.

Mrs Greaves had spoken out after a jury found Foster guilty of Mr Greaves' manslaughter. Bowling had previously admitted murder.
