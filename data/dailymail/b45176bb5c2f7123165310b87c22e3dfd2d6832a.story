Eric Cantona today spoke for the first time about his fight with a photographer outside a London pub, saying he was ‘used to it’.

The 47-year-old retired French footballer turned actor was arrested and cautioned for assaulting the man on Wednesday.

Cantona was back in Paris today, and told RTL radio it was ‘a simple fight with a paparazzi’, adding: ‘I’m used to it’.

The Manchester United legend, who is 
married with children, was particularly angry at references to an 
attractive brunette pictured alongside him in the The Queens pub in 
Primrose Hill.

He said that the person he punched in the face was not just ‘a man’ but ‘a paparazzi’.

‘I had a fight with a paparazzi whom I considered too intrusive,’ said Cantona.

‘I
 spent three, four hours at the police station and I returned to Paris 
as planned. So they were bothering me, but I’m used to that.’

Cantona
 was upset that the incident was made to sound worse that it was, mainly
 because nobody identified his victim as a photographer, but solely as 
‘a man’.

‘So we get into a fantasy’ said Cantona. ‘If it was that violent, I wouldn’t only have been kept for three to four hours.'

Justifying
 his decision to speak out, Cantona said: ‘It just allows me to clarify 
things for my family and friends, and those who love me, who were very 
concerned. You have to think about them sometimes.’

Cantona
 did not mention the woman he was with, who did not speak to police and 
who was later seen leaving the pub by a side door.

Cantona captained United in their successful 1996-97 season and scored the winning goal in the 1996 FA Cup final against Liverpool

Cantona
 lives with his second wife, the French actress-director Rachida Brakni,
 37, in the Paris suburb of Fontenay-sous-Bois. It is not known whether 
she was in the pub.

The couple, who have two children, a boy and a girl, met on the set of the film ‘l’Outremangeur’ (the Overeater) in 2003.

Cantona has become well known for his philosophical one-liners. Here is a selection of some of his best:-

On
 his achievements: 'I am searching for abstract ways of expressing 
reality, abstract forms that will enlighten my own mystery.'

On life: 'He who has regrets cannot look at himself in the mirror.'

On his looks: 'If someone is too perfect they won't look good. Imperfection is important.'

On education: 'I didn't study; I live.'

On
 his career: 'My best moment? I have a lot of good moments but the one I
 prefer is when I kicked the hooligan (at Crystal Palace).'

On Wednesday afternoon, Cantona appeared deep in conversation with the mystery woman as they drank beer in the sunshine.

But police were called when he attacked the photographer, who did not require a doctor.  

A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed Cantona ‘was taken into custody and subsequently cautioned for common assault.’

Cantona
 was convicted of assault in 1995 for a kung-fu attack on a Crystal 
Palace fan who abused the player after he was sent off for kicking 
defender Richard Shaw in a 1-1 draw at Selhurst Park, in south London.

He received a two-week prison sentence, although that was later reduced to 120 hours community service on appeal.

Cantona was also banned from football for eight months by the FA and fined a total of £30,000.

The
 Frenchman was worshipped by Manchester United fans as 'King Eric' and 
'Le God', but was as famous for his bizarre outbursts off the pitch as 
his performances on it.

He
 has stayed in the public eye since retiring from football and starred 
as himself in the 2009 film Looking For Eric, directed by Ken Loach.

He recently returned to screens in a tongue-in-cheek TV advert for French beer Kronenbourg 1664, which claimed hop farmers in the Alsace region of France are treated as well as footballers.

But the ad was engulfed in a row when the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned the campaign for misleading drinkers about the true origins of the beer.

The watchdog found the adverts misled viewers into thinking that the entire brewing process took place in France.
