Chelsea announced on Monday that midfielder Josh McEachran has joined Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem on a season-long loan.

The 21-year-old joined the Blues outfit as an eight-year-old but failed to impress despite making his first-team debut at 17.

The England-U21 player had loan spells at Swansea City, Middlesbrough, Watford before landing at Wigan Athletic earlier this year, where he made seven appearances.
