Control: Philip Davies MP says the EU wishes to punish media that is critical of its corruption

Brussels is pumping millions of pounds of public money into groups dedicated to stifling a free Press, it emerged yesterday.

The European Commission is helping to fund groups seeking state-backed regulation of newspapers, including key allies of Hugh Grant’s Hacked Off campaign.

One – called Mediadem – has a mission statement to ‘reclaim a free and independent media’ and is demanding tougher sanctions than ‘an apology or correction’.

The EU has spent £2.3million on the previously unpublicised project.

The commission says it wants to be a ‘moral compass’ against press misconduct and is seeking new national and Europe-wide regulatory powers against newspapers.

But critics say it is only taking such a stance because of the unfavourable coverage that European institutions get in the Press.

Philip Davies, a Tory member of the Culture Select Committee, said: ‘Given the scandals in the EU and revelations of its misappropriation of funding, it is no surprise that Europe wants to restrict the free press which can uncover its corruption.

‘And it shows up exactly the sort of body that Hacked Off is if it wants to ally itself with these sorts of people.’

A policy brief for Mediadem, co-authored by its lead British researcher, Rachael Craufurd Smith, says it is ‘simplistic’ to see state influence over the Press as ‘inherently stifling’.

Mediadem recently produced ‘recommendations for the UK’ demanding the ‘imposition of sanctions beyond an apology or correction’ on errant media outlets and the ‘co-ordination of the journalistic profession at the European level’.

Dr Craufurd Smith, from Edinburgh University, also called for further chilling action against the Press to ensure ‘that neither the media, nor those individuals who own or work for the media, enjoy an absolute right to freedom of expression’.

Some of the organisations are key allies of Hacked Off, which has celebrity backers like actor Hugh Grant

The recommendations demand the Press be controlled by the same body and on the same basis as broadcasters, who currently face stricter regulations including statutory ‘balance’ obligations that do not apply to newspapers.

Dr Craufurd Smith told the Sunday Telegraph that the EU funding may have been prompted by Brussels’ belief that the Press treats it unfairly.

As well as Mediadem, there are at least five other initiatives backed by Brussels to increase its powers over the media. One, MediaAcT, has channelled about £100,000 of European cash directly to a key Hacked Off ally, the Mediawise campaign group.

Bob Satchwell, executive director of the Society of Editors, said last night: ‘It is ‘strange if the EU is investing in ways to set up bureaucratic interference with the free Press’.
