Jon Stewart has continued his public skewering of the Republican-controlled House of Representatives following the government shutdown.

After a lengthy attack on Monday about the decision to avoid passing the budget due to the Republican hatred for the Affordable Care Act, he had a different target during his first show since the shutdown went into effect.

During his Tuesday show, Stewart lambasted Republican talking heads who he believed were belittling Americans who will be affected by the suspension of certain government programs.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Making his point clear: Jon Stewart, who is well-known for his liberal leanings, has been extremely critical of the Republicans since the beginning of the shutdown

In a Fox News clip, a Republican talking head was seen telling Sean Hannity that Democrats were acting as if the shutdown was the beginning of the apocalypse.

'If you believe the Democrats, it's time to go out and buy the potted meat and Tang and get in your survival bunker,' the conservative guest said during the Fox clip. 

'F*** you because first of all, democrats aren't the ones with survival bunkers- that's you guys,' Stewart said, as seen in the clip available on Gawker.

'And second, I know that for you potted meat and Tang is shorthand for sh** you wouldn't possibly consider eating unless there was a catastrophe but for the people actuall affected by the government shutdown, it's the sh** they eat that they can no longer afford.'

Pointed: He used a clip of a Republican commentator on Sean Hannity's Fox News show as an example of the belittling attitude that Republicans have for the Americans who have lost assistance during the shutdown

The program in question is the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) supplemental nutrition program for low-income citizens.

'It's like taking candy from a baby, except instead of candy, it's food,' Stewart said.

The comedian-turned-political satirist made his feelings about the logjam abundantly clear on Monday night when his show aired just an hour before the shutdown went into effect.

While a number of news anchors likened the back-and-forth of the bills between the Senate and the House as a stalemate, as opposed to the one-sided conflict that Stewart sees.

'I'm all for a pox on both their houses when appropriate but this is not a game of chicken! This is when someone is driving to work and there's a car coming directly at them in their lane. That's not a game of chicken, that's an a****** causing a head-on collision,' he said.

Political posturing: Stewart said that Republicans were only making themselves look worse by discrediting President Obama's talks with the Iranian President

'Did you see the Giants game on 
Sunday? Okay: they lost 31 to 7. And you know what the Giants didn’t say
 after that game? 'If you don’t give us 25 more points by midnight on 
Monday, we are gonna shut down the NFL!'

'Wouldn't
 it be nice if the United States Congress aspired to the maturity and 
problem solving capacity of football players- this is utter insanity

He also critiqued the Republican talking point that many of the party's leaders have been touting, saying that President Obama is to blame for the shutdown because he did not spend enough time with congressional leaders talking over possible compromises.

Instead, they raised his landmark discussion with the President of Iran as a offensive tactic, one which Stewart said only made Republicans look worse.

'You’re not helping yourself. If it turns out that President Barack Obama can make a deal with the most intransigent, hardline, unreasonable, totalitarian mullahs in the world, but not with Republicans, maybe he’s not the problem,' he said.
