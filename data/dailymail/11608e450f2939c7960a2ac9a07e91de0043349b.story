For most children, the beginning of the school year is an exciting time, especially for those moving from nursery into mainstream schooling for the first time.

But for one little boy, this transition is all the more special, having survived five rounds of chemotherapy to treat a rare form of kidney cancer which had spread to his lungs and liver.

Milo Carter, four, was diagnosed a year ago, but three weeks ago was well enough to start school thanks to life saving treatment at Great Ormond Street hospital.

Now his mother Sarah has decided to share Milo's story to help raise awareness of childhood cancers and the importance of the work of Cancer Research UK, which funds life saving research. 

Sarah, 36, who lives in Auchtertool, Scotland said: 'I call Milo my little Tonka truck as nothing knocks him and he just keeps on going.

'He's unbelievable and has responded amazingly well to everything that's been thrown at him. Milo has a strong body and all he focuses on are the good things. 

'Last summer he was going through major surgery to take out a kidney with cancer in it and this August he was getting his bag packed ready for a first day at school. What a difference a year makes.'

But Milo's fierce fight for life started on the day he was born. 

Sarah recalls vividly how excited she and her husband Kevin were ahead of their first child Milo's birth.

Pregnancy scans had not picked up any problems so it was a huge shock when doctors at Victoria hospital, Kirkcaldy explained that Milo was struggling to breathe. At just 72 hours old, Milo went in to heart failure and was blue lighted through to hospital where he endured a nine hour operation to repair his heart.

Milo's treatment involved two major operations and aggressive chemotherapy and radiotherapy 

Despite his intensive treatment, Milo has taken everything in his stride, attending nursery whenever he could

Before Milo was diagnosed, the only symptoms he displayed were tiredness and some nausea 

Sarah, here with Noah and Milo at a party, is incredibly proud of the way Milo has handled everything 

Sarah said: 'The first week after the operation was awful. It took several attempts to get Milo off the ventilator and breathing on his own again. It was so frightening. Milo was in hospital for two and a half months. Staying in that hospital with Milo became my whole life. But we got through it and after we finally got home Milo did really well. 

'We started to relax, feeling that Milo had been through his fair share of bad luck and was free to grow up healthy. It never entered our heads that at just three, Milo would have to go through a second life threatening problem totally unrelated to the first. What were the chances of that?'

That's why it was a such a blow when just months after Milo's brother Noah, now two, was born, Milo's appetite vanished and he became permanently exhausted.

Worried, Sarah took Milo to the doctor who referred them to hospital for more tests. And in April 2013, Milo was diagnosed with a Wilms tumour; a rare and aggressive cancer in both kidneys which scans revealed had already spread to his lungs and liver.

Sarah said: 'He needed the highest dose of chemotherapy and radiotherapy they could give.

'Milo's left kidney was twice the size it's meant to be. It was huge and he had three tumours in his second kidney as well as tumours in the main vein leading up to his heart. He started on chemotherapy straight away.'

At first they were warned that Milo may need to have both kidneys removed- facing a lifetime on dialysis or a transplant. But a surgeon at Great Ormond Street hospital in London succeeded in saving 90 per cent of Milo's right kidney. 

Explaining to Milo what was happening to him was heartbreaking for his family.

Sarah said: 'Milo knew that he wasn't managing to eat a lot. I told him there was something inside called a tumour inside his tummy.

'I explained that he had all those bits in his body and there was something pushing on his tummy that the doctor was going to take out to make him feel better again. I told him there were bad cells that the doctors were going to take away. I tried to be as honest with him as I could.'

And in November last year, Milo returned to London to have the tumours on his right kidney removed. 

Only six days later Milo was well enough to explore all five floors of Hamley's world famous toy shop in Regent Street.

It meant Milo could spend Christmas at home in Scotland with the family ahead of three weeks in January of radiotherapy where he had to endure an anaesthetic every day.

Sarah said; 'The nursery staff and parents have been amazing.

'They gave me a a photobook with lovely messages and they've been there every step of the way. Through all of this it was really important to me that everything was kept as normal as possible for Milo and he's been at nursery as often as he can be.'

Just weeks ago, mum Sarah was speechless when doctors explained that latest scans show the treatment is working.

Sarah said; 'That took my breath away. They can see no tumours or abnormalities in his body at the moment.

'Milo absolutely loves school. He finished treatment about three weeks before he started so he didn't feel too unwell and his hair was semi back - so he felt quite normal.

'It's early days now and too early to talk about a cure. But things have gone so well so far and although there may be a lot of worry ahead but we'll get through it with the help of friends and family.'

Sarah is supporting Give Up Clothes for Good, a campaign supported by TK Maxx and Cancer Research UK raising money to help beat kids’ cancer sooner. Visit tkmaxx.com 

Since 2004, the campaign has raised £13.2m to help the charity find ways to beat children’s cancers sooner by funding research into many areas including developing better treatments that also reduce the long term side effects
