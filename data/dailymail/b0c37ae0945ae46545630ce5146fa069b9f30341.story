Despite her superhuman strength, powers of flight and incredible agility, even Wonder Woman could succumb to breast cancer.

That's the message being sent out to young women in the African nation of Mozambique today which is deploying a number of superheroes in its fight against the disease.

Wonder Woman has been joined by other female comic book characters including Storm, She-Hulk and Catwoman to highlight that even they need to be aware of the warning signs.

Not immune: Wonder Woman checks her breasts for signs of cancer in a new campaign which aims to raise awareness of the disease in Mozambique, particularly among younger women

It's no joke: In this illustration, created by artist Maisa Chaves, Catwoman gives herself a thorough examination

The illustrations, created by artist Maisa Chaves, show the women of steel checking their breasts for lumps.

A caption next to them reads: 'When we talk about breast cancer, there's no women or superwomen.

'Everybody has to do the self-examination monthly. Fight with us against the enemy and, when in doubt, talk with your doctor.'

The campaign, run by the Associação da Luta Contra o Cancer, isn't afraid to shock young women if it means they visit their GP.

Previous ads made it appear as though spiders and cockroaches were living under the skin of women’s breasts.

Powerful message: X-Men heroine Storm also features in the campaign by the Associação da Luta Contra o Cancer, which hopes it shocks women into seeing their doctor

Awareness: Despite her impressive physique, even She-Hulk is not immune to the disease

Although breast cancer is uncommon in women under 30, survival rates are lower for younger patients, and campaigns that target this age group are crucial in getting the message over about early detection.

In October, Facebook caused outrage when it removed images posted by a U.S. campaign group showing survivors of breast cancer with their chests painted. It claimed the pictures breached its terms of use.

Internationally, breast cancer charities join forces every October for a month-long campaign to raise awareness and generate vital funding for research, with many celebrities getting on board.
