Facing ruin: Carer Kumari Murphy has been ordered to pay auctioneer Nicholas Rayner £1.2m after she swindled almost £780,000 from him

A 'dictatorial' carer who swindled her auctioneer boss out of almost £780,000 is facing financial ruin after she was ordered to pay him back £1.2million.

Kumari Murphy took advantage of Nicholas Rayner, the former boss of Sotheby’s Geneva branch, who famously orchestrated the 1987 sale of the Duchess of Windsor's gems.

The celebrated auctioneer and former Army officer, had become increasingly dependent on Murphy, after his glittering career at the auction block was cut short by a devastating stroke.

While caring for Mr Rayner, 'emotional bully' Murphy would frequently listen
in to telephone calls, isolated him from his family and monitored every
aspect of his life, while pocketing large sums in cash from her 
vulnerable charge.

She even persuading him to pay tens of thousands of pounds in school fees for a daughter she never had.

Murphy,
60, even claimed that she had been a 'wonderful' carer for Mr Rayner, 
now 77, for more than 12 years before she was unceremoniously sacked.

However,
Judge Jeremy Cousins QC found in April that she had cheated Mr Rayner 
to the tune of almost £780,000 - as well as running up a staggering 
£160,000 in bills for personal phone calls.

The total she was ordered to repay Mr Rayner, with interest, came to more than £1.2 million.

Today,
Murphy pleaded for mercy at London’s Appeal Court, insisting that she 
had done her utmost for Mr Rayner, only to be left facing a life of 
loneliness and poverty.

However, Lord Justice Christopher Clarke dismissed her challenge as hopeless.

The errant carer had insisted that Mr 
Rayner had promised to maintain her for the rest of her life and that 
his £2.3m Knightsbridge home, where they once lived together, should 
rightfully be hers when he dies.

In his original decision, Judge 
Cousins said she was not due a penny after branding her a 'profoundly 
unsatisfactory witness' who had done all she could to exploit Mr 
Rayner’s vulnerability and fleece him of chunks of his fortune.

Condemning
the maths lecturer for the 'excessive pressure, emotional blackmail or 
bullying' she brought to bear on her frail charge the judge said her 
claim that Mr Rayner had never paid her for her work was a bare-faced 
lie.

The auctioneer had a 
devastating stroke in 1994 and, as he became more and more emotionally 
dependent on Murphy, she 'encouraged' his isolation from his family and 
friends and used her dominance over him to plunder him for money.

She
had even convinced him to shell out tens of thousands of pounds in 
‘school fees’ for a young relative in Bangalore, who she had falsely 
claimed was her daughter.

The judge said: 'There was dependence and vulnerability on his side, and ascendency, domination and control on hers.'

Mr Rayner met his £400-a-week carer while she was doing voluntary work in his former home in Eaton Square in 1994.

She said that he had made 'various promises to try to induce her to stay with him and look after him' and insisted that 'he owed his life' to her.

Murphy claimed millionaire Mr Rayner had pledged she would be 'provided for for life' but, after a further stroke put him in hospital in 2008, his family began to suspect that the carer was 'seriously misappropriating Mr Rayner’s money on a considerable scale'.

She swiftly found herself out of a job and evicted from Mr Rayner's home in exclusive Ennismore Gardens, Knightsbridge, London.

Holding Mrs Murphy to account in 
April, Judge Cousins found that, of the £1.2 million she had spent from 
Mr Rayner’s fortune, less than £400,000 had been for his benefit.

She had also run up £176,000 in telephone bills on his line, £160,000 of which were for her personal calls.

Murphy was in the Court of Appeal today as her niece, Veena Raj, made an impassioned plea on her behalf.

She insisted that her aunt had not been given a fair hearing and had been honest in all her dealings with Mr Rayner.

However, Lord Justice Clarke said that Judge Cousins had clearly disbelieved Murphy and it was not for him to re-decide the facts.

He added that there was not a shred of evidence that Judge Cousins had been biased or prejudiced against her, nor that he had made up his mind before he heard the evidence.

Paying tribute to Judge Cousins’ ‘careful analysis’ of the case, the Lord Justice Clarke told tearful Murphy that her challenge stood no reasonable prospect of success and refused to grant her permission to appeal.

﻿The Sotheby’s 1987 sale of the Duchess of Windsor’s collection, raised more than £33million, a world record for any single-owner jewellery collection. Included was a heart-shaped 20th anniversary brooch commissioned in 1957 by the Duke.
