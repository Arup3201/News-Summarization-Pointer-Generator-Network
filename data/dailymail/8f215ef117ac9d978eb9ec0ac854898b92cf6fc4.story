A macho father-of-three construction worker who used to secretly wear women's underwear to work has now become a woman.

After struggling with his gender his entire life, Sam Bowler finally decided to make the change. Much to the surprise of fellow builders, the lipstick-wearing digger-operator said: 'Call me Samantha.'

Thankfully, within a couple of days the construction crew fully accepted their new brunette, bejewelled member of the team.

Accepted: Samantha Bowler, 47 works as a digger driver on a building site - she used to be a macho man

Decision time: But after a lifetime struggling with his gender Sam, now Samantha, took the decision to begin living as a woman

Samantha, 47, said: 'I was afraid I’d get a lot of abuse, but the lads on the site have been great.

'They were a bit shocked and left me alone the first day and someone called me "Sam the Man" which I can handle.

'But my work mates all became very relaxed and easy about it within a couple of days.

'I feel very comfortable in the site canteen - everyone has been very respectful.'

Samantha knew from the age of five that she was different from the other boys in school. Growing up she preferred to play with girls and dolls rather than join in with the boys playing football.

Life-long struggle: The father-of-three has been conflicted about her gender from the age of five

She would secretly dress in her mother’s clothes, borrow her make-up and style her hair in the bathroom mirror.

But because she was confused and afraid to talk about her feelings she developed a macho male persona.

She said: 'I became a loner, isolated 
and insecure - I found the best way to cope was to suppress my feelings 
by being a man in a man’s world.

'I worked as a computer engineer, then on building sites, I got married and became a father.

'I was divorced when I was 24 but soon married again and had another child.

Transition: Samantha suffered from hate crime in her community in the early days of her transition, left. Now she is confident and content in her now female gender and is accepted by her construction co-workers

From the age of five Samantha used to wear her mother's make-up and play with girls' toys

Samantha would secretly wear women's underwear to work in her job as a construction worker

'I took up karate and gained a black belt - I did weightlifting, I was a family man who loved to be at home.

'I was married for 11 years, I loved my wife but deep down I hated my body. I longed to be someone else, the person I am now.'

After a second divorce Sam lived alone and wore women’s clothes and make-up when no one was around.

And under her builder’s clobber of jeans 
and a jumper she would be wearing women’s underwear on the site: 'It was
not for any sexual reason - I just wanted to be me, feminine.'

Struggling with her secret, Samantha tried to be extra macho, taking stereotypical masculine jobs, doing weight training and karate

Samantha had three children with three women - the last partner encouraged her to seek psychiatric help

Samantha later had another 
relationship and fathered a third son with a new woman who because of 
Sam’s deep depression encouraged her to get the help she so urgently 
needed.

Samantha was diagnosed with gender 
dysphoria - a condition where a person feels there is a mismatch between
their biological sex and their gender identity. Samantha changed her male name by Deed Poll.

After four years of hormone therapy, and overcoming hate crime in her local community of Pontypridd, South Wales, Samantha is nearing the end of her gender transition.

She continues to work on the building site but one day hopes to switch to a full-time role as a transgender counsellor

She said: 'Before I transitioned I was
aggressive, short-tempered, flippant - I was trying to prove my 
masculinity and overplayed it.

Samantha says she is a better 'father' now to her children having gone through the gender transition

'Since I have transitioned I am nothing like that. I am gentle and kind and I think I have the patience of a saint.'

Samantha says she is a better father now, especially to her five-year-old who still calls her dad.

When she’s not on a building site Samantha acts as a consultant on transgender issues for the government, the police and local authorities.

She has recorded educational videos for 
many organisations, talking about her life story and telling of some of 
the abuse she has endured.

Ultimately, she hopes to ditch the building site work and switch to this role full time.

She said: 'I am proud of who I am and I’m not going to pretend to be anyone other than me anymore.

'I consider myself unique and very fortunate.

'How many people get to live two lives, I don’t deny my birth gender but I’m happy and proud of who I am now.'
