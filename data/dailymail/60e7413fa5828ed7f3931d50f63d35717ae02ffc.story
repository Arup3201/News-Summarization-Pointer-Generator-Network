Exhausted: Since the birth of her first child just weeks ago, Ashley says she feels like she has aged 10 years - and doesn't recognise the bleary-eyed woman in the mirror

Let’s face it, not everyone is comfortable with injecting a toxin into their face. And for pregnant and breastfeeding women particularly - it is most definitely not on the menu.

When new mother Kim Kardashian first came home with baby North, there were rumours that she had elected not to breastfeed, in order to get back to her beloved Botox injections sooner rather than later. However, she was subsequently said to have changed her mind.

Maybe she found out about Baby Botox.

A term once used to describe 
miniscule but strategic amounts of Botox carefully applied and with 
great restraint, Baby Botox has taken on a whole new meaning amongst the
yummy mummy set. 

Indeed
it’s becoming increasingly popular for pregnant women and the new, and 
often breastfeeding mother determined that her face not look as tired as
she feels.

And while 
‘No-Tox’ face treatments have been around for a while, the market for 
mums is booming with brand new and innumerable options to keep you 
looking your best during this challenging and constantly exhausting time
of your life.

Most of us realise that having a baby
affects not only your body, but also has a major impact on your face.

I
can vividly recall waking up shortly after my daughter was born and 
thinking ‘who in the world is she?’ as I stared at my bleary eyed, 
slack-jawed face after a 3am feed. 

I had aged a decade it seemed, in the space of a few weeks.

Early
mornings, late night feeds, the stress of making sure that the baby’s 
taken care of properly combined with a general lack of sleep can lead to
a look of perpetual weariness that I suspect all new mothers are 
familiar with.

As more sleep was not an immediate possibility, I began my research into what actually could be done.

To be sure, there are lots of options out there: I tried and liked Beetox, (bee venom), Pre-tox, (Peptide gel), Dr Nabet’s L.Boxin (natural enzymes), and Endocare (snail secretions). All good choices and worth exploring.

owever what I discovered is, at the moment, the term most buzzed about amongst beauty editors – and indeed at Gymborees and Starbucks around the nation -  is ‘VTOX’. 

Created by skincare guru Linda Meredith and voted ‘the best alternative to Botox’ by Tatler Magazine, VTOX is quite simply, the Queen of Baby Botox.

No-Tox? It was rumoured Kim Kardashian elected not to breastfeed so she could take up Botox injections again after her baby's birth - but she is said to have subsequently changed her mind. Right, Gwyneth Paltrow has visited the Linda Meredith clinic and Madonna is said to be a fan of Meredith's oxygen facials

It contains neuro-peptides and natural algae which surround the muscles with proteins to block the skin contracting.

Says Linda, 'Researching through the thousands of ingredients available, I found that the most effective botanical was Algae Extract. Combined with other natural ingredients, the skin will appear more youthful and relaxing without looking frozen in time.'

A toxin-free treatment with staying power, VTOX works by gently helping the skin avoid conforming to expression lines when the muscles contract. The key words here are ‘gently’ and ‘natural’. 

It’s like Botox without the poison or freeze. 

Sold online as a stand alone lotion, or as part of a professional facial treatment, VTOX is hugely popular amongst the women who frequent Linda Meredith’s Knightsbridge salon - whether pregnant, breastfeeding, or just looking for smoother skin in a natural way.

'Botox is a registered trademark of Allergan a U.S. based company. It is used to freeze certain muscles in the face to reduce expression and age lines.

The LM alternative is called V-TOX that uses algae derivatives to relax the skin.

Our product was designed for those clients who did not want to have a toxin injected into the skin as well as for women who are pregnant and should refrain throughout their pregnancy.

It is a more effective treatment for those with deeper frown lines no matter what age.

The Standard Oxygen treatment is carried out and then the V-TOX is added to specific areas that need to be treated or a fine layer can be applied generally over the entire face and neck.

The product is then infused into the skin by the steady flow of oxygen.'

- Linda Meredith

A skin care expert for more than 40 years, Linda Meredith developed VTOX after a storied career of taking care of some of the world’s most beautiful and famous faces.

Madonna, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Moss, Stella McCartney, Kate Beckinsale and Sienna Miller have all been clients. 

Linda says, 'Unsurprisingly, staying young and beautiful for as long as possible is on every woman’s wish list. 

Medical professionals continue to develop treatments deemed ‘cosmetic,’ some of which are certainly beneficial, but others put pressure on women to have procedures they are not totally comfortable with. The first buzz word was of course ‘Botox’ but not all women want to be injected with a poisonous toxin.'

She adds, 'When developing my own range of skincare products one of my priorities was to have an effective option for those women looking for a Botox alternative including those pregnant or breast feeding who had to refrain from their usual Botox fix.'

The VTOX Oxygen facial begins with a deep cleaning, steaming and intense hydration followed by a generous amount of the VTOX cream. It feels tingly but not unpleasant. This is followed up by more gentle blasts of pure Oxygen, layered on to plump up what is now, rather smooth skin. The end result promises to leave you with skin as smooth as the bottom of the baby in your arms.

I emerged glowing, which many facials can admittedly achieve, but also got the added benefit of the lift that I was looking for.

My skin was tighter and looked less tired than it had been in quite some time.  I was delighted to look a bit more like the person I was used to seeing in the mirror.

And after all, post baby, it may take months or even years to get one’s body back, but women like me are quickly realising that your face doesn’t have to wait.

VTOX retails for £99 and a VTOX Oxygen Facial is £150. Both can be found at www.lindameredith.com
