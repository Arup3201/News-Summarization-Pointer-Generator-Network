Prodigy: Jacob Velasquez plays entire sonatas without needing to look at sheet music

It all began one afternoon about a year ago. Mr Velasquez’s mother Tina was in the kitchen and heard music coming from the living room, she thought it was the boy’s father.

‘Willie was at work and I was in the kitchen and I hear the song Willie was playing the night before,’ she told Local 10, adding ‘I came in here and said, 'Jacob, oh my gosh, that's you.’

Soon after able to read music, Mr Velasquez learned Beethoven’s Sonata in only three weeks.

The youngster’s photographic memory enables him to look at sheet music only once and he can memorize a song, according to the station.

Remarkable: Mr Velasquez learns an entire sonata in one afternoon, it takes others a month

The whiz kid’s parents soon decided to have him audition for the National Musician’s Guild, they told the station. Not an easy task, many adults are intimidated, but not Jacob.

‘"He had to learn 10 classical pieces all by memory,’ father Willie Velasquez told the station.

The wunderkind nailed it.

‘He did amazing, actually, he exceeded the expectations,’ the proud father added.

Why does he like to play piano?: 'Because I learn all these songs!'

Mr Velasquez’s proficiency has him learning entire songs in one class – it takes others a month to learn, according to piano teacher Jaffird Sierra.

His feet too short to reach the pedals, Mr Velasquez has to adjust his playing to suit his size limitations.

‘I think he has it in his mind the whole knowledge but he has too short of hands and he is too small and he wants to play,’ Ms Sierra told the station, adding ‘he knows, but he cannot do that.’

Unlike many prodigies, Mr Velasquez enjoys his craft. When asked why, he said ‘Because I learn all these songs!’
