Russia has accused Ukrainian air-traffic control of sending Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 into the conflict zone where it was shot down last month.

The Russian envoy to the UN Security Council has demanded Kiev release all records of its air-traffic controllers' communications with the plane, whose downing is the subject of a major diplomat crisis.

The passenger jet carrying 298 people was hit by a missile the Ukrainian government and its allies say was fired from the rebel-held Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine on July 17.

Wreckage: The crash site of MH17, which went down on July 17 with the loss of all 298 passengers and crew

Tragedy: The downing of the jet over Ukraine's conflict zone has led to a major diplomatic crisis

Russia says there is a lack of proof for this claim and expressed concerns at the UN Security Council over Kiev's refusal to release transcripts of conversations its air traffic controllers had with MH17.

'Nothing is known about the record of talks between Ukrainian flight controllers,' said Russian envoy to the UN, Vitaly Churkin .

'They should produce the records of talks between their flight controllers so that it would be possible to understand why they directed the Malaysian plane into the conflict zone.'

The West has blamed pro-Kremlin rebels using a BUK weapons system for the horrific incident, which killed all MH17's passengers and crew, pending a Dutch-led probe.

Senior Russian military figures have claimed the plane was shot down by the Ukrainian army, a theory rejected by Kiev and the U.S.

Mr Churkin claimed that the investigation is sidelining the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) as well as the Interstate Aviation Committee (MAK) which monitors the airspace in the former Soviet Union.

He has called for UN assistance 'on the need to make the investigation international'.

The remains of at least 15 Malaysians killed when a plane was shot down over Ukraine will be returned to their home country this week, the country's defence minister says.

All 298 people on board died when Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down on July 17. The plane was heading to Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam and was shot out of the sky, crashing in an area of eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russia separatists. 

The victims included 43 Malaysians and 195 Dutch nationals.

With fighting between the rebels and Ukrainian forces ongoing near the crash site, victims' remains were gathered and sent to the Netherlands for identification.

Malaysian defence minister Hishammuddin Hussein said 28 Malaysian victims had been identified so far, including 15 passengers and 13 crew members.

The remains of at least 15 Malaysians and a Dutch national who was married to a Malaysian will arrive in Kuala Lumpur on Friday, Mr Hishammuddin said at a news conference, adding that the exact number to arrive would be known later in the week.

The government has declared Friday a national day of mourning.

Mr Hishammuddin said Malaysia would not be competing with the Netherlands in terms of how the bodies are received. The Netherlands observed a minute's silence and solemn ceremonies were held when the remains of the victims arrived in the country last month.

Dutch authorities said last week that they had identified 127 victims in all.
