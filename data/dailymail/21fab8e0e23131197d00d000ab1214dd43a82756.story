Eliaquim Mangala claims that Diego Costa does try to provoke his opponents – but insists it's irrelevant if Chelsea’s combative striker is allowed to play in Saturday’s title clash with Manchester City at Stamford Bridge.

Costa will face a FA disciplinary hearing on Friday to contest a charge of violent conduct after it was alleged that he deliberately stamped on Emre Can in Chelsea’s Capital One Cup semi-final win over Liverpool in midweek.

The Spain striker, who also clashed with Martin Skrtel and Steven Gerrard in a bad-tempered encounter, faces a three-game ban if found guilty – starting with the game against champions City.

Mangala admitted that Costa tries ‘to provoke a reaction’ from his markers to distract them, and believes the best way of combating it is to simply ignore him.

‘For me it doesn’t matter if Costa is playing or not,’ said the big City defender. ‘The most important thing is to care about what we have to do. Whether it’s Costa who plays, (Didier) Drogba or Loïc Rémy it’s the same thing for me. We need to beat them. No matter who is playing on the day, our target is to win that game.

‘Costa is a player that always tries to win a mental duel against his opponent. He always tries to unsettle his marker or other players and distract them from playing their normal game.

‘He likes to provoke a reaction but, personally, I don’t respond to that. When you know that it’s what he is looking for, it’s better to ignore him because he will then realise that what he is doing is pointless. If you react he wins.’

Mangala admitted that City need to win to have a chance of closing the five-point gap at the top of the table. ‘We go there to get a result,’ he added. ‘It’s an important game against an important rival for the title. We need to close the gap with Chelsea and the best way to do that is to get a win in Stamford Bridge.

‘I think Chelsea will play on the counter-attack. We are an attack-minded team and we will not change our style of play. We need to play our normal game. We know that Chelsea is a team that likes to defend, is well organised and like to counter-attack. They have quality players but we also have a lot of quality players in our squad.’
