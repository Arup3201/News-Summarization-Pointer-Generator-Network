It might not have the power to deliver your shopping, but this photo-taking 'Rolling Spider' could soon bring drone technology to the masses.

A Paris-based electronics firm has just released a miniature spying robot that it claims is more affordable and easier to control that existing drones.

The smartphone-controlled toy, dubbed 'Rolling Spider', has four rotors and can also be adapted to move on two wheels to roll on the ground or on a wall.

It might not have the power to deliver your shopping, but this photo-taking 'Rolling Spider' could soon bring drone technology to the masses. The smartphone-controlled toy, dubbed 'Rolling Spider', has four rotors and can also be adapted to move on two wheels to roll on the ground or on a wall

The £90 ($150) drone's flight is controlled through an app while a smartphone's built-in accelerometer changes the drone's direction up to a range of 160ft (49 metres).

The company claims the 65g drone is sturdy enough to bounce of walls and an ultrasonic sensor, gyroscope and downwards-facing camera keep it in the air.

But despite its impressive maneuverability, the Rolling Spider has just six minutes of battery life.

The drone, which will be available later this month, comes with a free app running on iOS, Android, and from October under Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1.

'We wanted to create connected robots for the generations of smartphones and tablets,' Parrot spokeswoman Vanessa Loury said a demonstration in New York.

Parrot is also known for its civilian and professional drones, including one that can be used for mapping and for agricultural crop monitoring.

In the US, the question of drones is still being studied by aviation officials, although these types of toys may be flown at low altitudes.

As for the question of drones for package delivery - as envisioned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos - Parrot said the time has not yet arrived.

'Delivering packages is a long way off,' said Parrot executive Peter George.

'I can't see that happening for 20 years.' But Mr George added that with the devices, 'it's really been about having fun with toys.'

A New York partygoer has spoken of his shock after being hit by a drone at a hi-tech 'home of the future' party.

Publisher Stephen Kosloff tweeted shocking images from the party, organised by gadget website Gizmodo, of his blood-stained t- shirt after an out of control drone hit him in the head.

The drone, which is believed to have had technical problems, hit Kosloff in the ear and forehead.

'I am now the only person I know who was wounded by a #drone at a @Gizmodo party. #tech' he tweeted.

'A few folks had the drone on a table, and they fired it up again,' Kosloff told The Awl

'Next thing I know, WHAM!!!!!!! Right in my f**king head. The drone.'
