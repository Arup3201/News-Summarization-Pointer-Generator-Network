The England and Wales Cricket Board has agreed a new broadcasting rights deal with Fox Sports in Australia.

Fox will show live coverage of this summer's home series against India, next year's pre-Ashes series against New Zealand and this weekend's match between MCC and a Rest of the World XI at Lord's.
