A family of serial bank robbers that ran rings around the police with eight heists in four months have been caught.

Brock Butson, 51, and his sons Braden, 23, and Nicholas, 20, successfully raided Academy Bank in Colorado Springs four times since May - in between robberies at the city's American National Bank, US Bank and First Bank.

A major investigation team enlisted the help of the FBI after chasing the trio for four months without success.

Initially searching for one suspect, baffled officers were thrown by reports that seemed to describe the same man - but his height kept changing.

But after a tip-off on Monday led them to the getaway car, the team discovered a family of gangsters in Travel Star motel.

The gang were arrested on Thursday after days of surveillance.

In each holdup, the suspect wore a baseball cap and demanded money without a weapon.

The
 father, Brock, is said to have driven the getaway car as 
his children took it in turns to demand cash in a family conspiracy 
harking back to the likes of the Kray Twins and The Godfather.

Shia LaBeouf, Tom Hardy and Jason Clarke play brothers of a Prohibition-era gangster family in Lawless

It is a classic tale that has inspired films for decades - including last year's Lawless, in which Shia LaBeouf, Tom Hardy and Jason Clarke appear as a family bootlegging trio in Prohibition-era America.

Using their near-identical features, Braden and Nicholas Butson, like Ronnie and Reggie Kray, were a forceful double act.

Police revised their estimated photographic ID of the single suspect a number of times as they grappled to make sense of the conflicting reports from witnesses.

All three are being held at the Criminal Justice Centre in Colorado Springs.

Sons Braden and Nicolas are due to stand trial on 16 September. A date is not set for father Brock.
