Meet real life action hero Zarene Dallas who has doubled for some of Hollywood's biggest stars as Britain's most successful stuntwoman

Thrill-seeker Zarene's ability to 
perform dangerous and versatile stunts - including kick boxing, climbing
 and being set on fire - has put her in high demand.

Zarene, from Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, said: 'My job is so exciting, every day is completely different.

'Even
 if I am just falling down a hole for the day, I still get such an 
adrenaline rush every time I'm on set performing a stunt.

'One
 day I could be riding horses, the next day I could be in a bar fight or
 racing a motorbike at high speeds. I absolutely love what I do.'

Zarene has already doubled for actors Cameron Diaz, Nicole Kidman, Carey Mulligan and Michelle Rodriguez

The native Australian, who has lived 
in England for the past 13 years, fell into the world of stunts 
following a childhood love affair with horse riding and an active 
lifestyle.

Zarene said: 'I was always really sporty and active as a kid, and a complete horse nut. Ever since I was a child, it has always been my dream to ride horses in movies which is how I got in to performing stunts.

'And
 my dream came true within my first year of work when I got the chance 
to double for Cameron Diaz in The Counsellor. It was my dream come true -
 I had to pinch myself.

In her first year of work Zarene got the chance 
to double for Cameron Diaz in The Counsellor, she said: 'It was my dream

Zarene said: 'I was always really sporty and active as a kid, and a complete horse nut. Ever since I was a child, it has always been my dream to ride horses in movies which is how I got in to performing stunts.'

'I only finished my training three years ago and since then I have been very lucky to have been offered so much work on so many amazing films and shows.

'It's a really close-knit industry and it can be tricky to make a name for yourself. Some people can work one day a year then struggle to find work.

'I work mostly in feature films. It can be really intense and a lot of hard work, but I wouldn't want to do anything else.

'To do this job you have to be really disciplined - I have to train hard and I watch what I eat.'

Stuntmen and women have formed a very close-knit industry and so it's hard for new talent to make a name for themselves

Zarene admits that she was most star-struck when meeting Nicole Kidman for the first time

Despite rubbing shoulders with some of Tinsel Town's top stars, the Australian adrenaline-junkie has learned to keep her cool among the world's top actresses.

Zarene said: 'I was most starstruck when I doubled for Nicole Kidman, in the upcoming film Paddington Bear.

'She was so professional, and so keen to get things done. She knows what she wants and what works, and to work with such an experienced and robust actress was a privilege.

'She is such an intelligent and sensationally beautiful woman. I always want to treat the actresses I double for as just another normal person, but she is an enormous star.'
