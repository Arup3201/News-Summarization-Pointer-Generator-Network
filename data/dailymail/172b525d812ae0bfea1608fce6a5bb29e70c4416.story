Arrested: Josh Young, 18, pictured in a mugshot from the weekend, was arrested Saturday morning after officers said he grabbed the victim and punched her in the stomach, causing her to throw up

A teen who was acquitted in the murder of his stepbrother has been charged with beating up his girlfriend.

Josh Young, 18, from Louisville, Kentucky, was arrested Saturday morning after officers said he grabbed the victim and punched her in the stomach, causing her to throw up.

He is also accused of choking his live-in girlfriend, also 18, while holding a pillow over her face, and police records state she had bruises up her arms.

The paperwork states the fight started because the victim wasn't in bed with Young and he allegedly told her he was going to kill her as well as threatening to walk into a police station and begin shooting so they would shoot him.

Young is 
charged with assault and wanton endangerment and is being held at the 
Louisville Department of Corrections on $1,000 bond.

Young
 previously faced charges in the May 2011 slaying of his step-brother, 
Trey Zwicker.

He faced trial last August but was acquitted on the charge
 of complicity to murder and one count of tampering with physical 
evidence.Â 

His
 father, Josh Gouker, was sentenced to life in prison in July after 
pleading guilty to the murder. He had initially told police Young had 
confessed to the killing but changed his story.

At
 the time he said of the murder: 'It just felt right. I know it sounds 
monstrous and all that s***, but it's not. If we was in the Old 
Testament, it'd be the same thing.'

Arrest: Josh Young, pictured after being found not guilty in August, was arrested Saturday for beating his girlfriend

Scene: Police were called to the Louisville apartment, pictured, the couple share on Saturday morning

Victim: Trey Zwicker, 14, pictured was discovered beaten to death behind Liberty High School in May 2011

According to WLKY.com, Gouker now claims that he lied when he took responsibility for Trey Zwicker's death.

Gouker is scheduled to return to the court where he was sentenced next month to appeal the conviction.

Zwicker's devastated father told wlky.com that he found out about the teen's recent run-in with the law on Facebook.

'I
 feel strongly that our justice system got it wrong. I know the little 
boy. I know the little boy has violent tendencies. I've known him most 
of his life.

'This
 just goes to show that that somebody made a mistake somewhere and now 
there's a young lady that's been hurt because of it,' said Terry 
Zwicker.

He added to WDRB.com that he still believes Young should be locked up.

'He deserves to pay for what he's done and not only what he's done to that young lady. He deserves to pay for the murder of my child. I'm not stupid.

'I know the boy did it. I feel it in my bones that he did it so this just goes to show the jury was wrong by letting him go and now somebody else is hurt,' he said.

Trey Zwicker, 14, was discovered beaten to death behind Liberty High School three years ago.
