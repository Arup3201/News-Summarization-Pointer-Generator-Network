Sheffield Eagles have left Owlerton Stadium for a second and final time, the Championship club have announced.

The Eagles moved back to Owlerton, which was their first home in 1984, following the closure of the Don Valley Stadium 12 months ago but the venue does not meet new Rugby Football League ground regulations which include floodlights and a minimum of 1,500 permanent seats.

John Gilburn, managing director of Owlerton Stadium, said: 'We would like to wish the Sheffield Eagles all the very best for the future.'
