Xavi gave former manager Pep Guardiola a resounding 'no' when offered the chance to join Bayern Munich this summer.

The German champions were willing to double Xavi's wages to lure him away from Barcelona, according to Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo.

But the midfield master, who has been at the Nou Camp for his entire career, firmly declined the offer to end his career in Bavaria.

Having failed to entice 34-year-old Xavi, Guardiola turned his attentions to Real Madrid's Xabi Alonso, eventually signing him for a fee in the region of £5m.

Mundo report that Xavi was unwilling to sign for a side that might come into direct competition with Barcelona and is more receptive to a move to the Middle East or United States when he finally decides to leave.

AS, meanwhile, feature Cristiano Ronaldo on their front cover as he fights to be fit in time for Saturday night's Madrid derby with Atletico.

A combination of knee and thigh injuries saw Ronaldo rested for Real Madrid's last match against Real Sociedad and he wasn't risked in Portugal's Euro 2016 qualifying defeat to Albania at the weekend.

But the forward returned to full training with Real on Tuesday alongside the likes of Toni Kroos, Fabio Coentrao, Pepe, Iler Casillas and Karim Benzema.

The paper also reports that Atletico requested 250 tickets for the match at Santiago Bernabeu but have so far only sold 30 of them.

Marca pick up on Gareth Bale's double for Wales in their opening qualifier with Andorra, saying the Real man was 'charged with dynamite'.

At the foot of the page, Paco Alcacer, the Valencia striker who scored his first goal for Spain in their match with Macedonia on Monday, is described as the 'bargain of Europe'.

Alcacer has a release clause of just £14.5m, which could spark a bidding war in the next transfer window.

The Italian sports dailies reflect on a satisfying 2-0 win for Italy in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier with Norway, with Simone Zaza and Leonardo Bonucci on target.

Gazzetta dello Sport have the headline 'ItalConte, what strength!' and say Antonio Conte's ideas have already revitalised the national side, praising their pressing, integrity and organisation in the match.

They praise Zaza, who was brought in for the suspended Mario Balotelli, and call his powerful finish in the 16th minute the highlight of the night.

They're not Conte's concern any more, but Juventus have an injury scare with Arturo Vidal and the midfielder, a target for Man United over the summer, will miss Saturday's home match with Udinese with a muscle problem.

Strength: Gazzetta dello Sport was delighted with Italy's win over Norway in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier

Corriere dello Sport concurs with Gazzetta, it's headline reading: 'We like this Italy.'

They believe that Conte has already shaped a 'solid and gritty' squad in his own mould and also praised Zaza on his competitive debut.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic could also face a lengthy ban for his elbow on Austria's David Alaba in Monday's Euro qualifier, something picked up by many of the papers.

Impressed: Corriere was also delighted with the performance, praising manager Antonio Conte

Austria's players said the referee, Pavel Kralovec, was scared of the Sweden striker and didn't want to send him off.

The disastrous World Cup seems a long time ago, say Tuttosport, as they hail a 'fine' Italy performance on their front page.

Juve, meanwhile, could offer Stephan Lichtsteiner to Paris Saint-Germain in order to secure the signing of Adrien Rabiot, who is also wanted by Roma.
