Michael Gove once joked that he’d rather be represented on the world stage by his dog than by Ed Miliband.

And yesterday, the former Education Secretary’s Bichon Frise puppy proved just how useful he could be - coming runner-up in the annual Westminster Dog of the Year competition.

While the competition was dominated by Conservative MPs and their dogs, Mr Gove’s Snowy was beaten to the top prize by Labour MP Rob Flello and his German Shepherd, Diesel.

Third place was taken by Tory MP Laurence Robertson and his dachshund, Sausage.

Mr Gove said he was ‘absolutely delighted’ his pet had come second in the annual contest.

He said Snowy, a rescue dog who has been with the Goves for just under two years, was an ‘indispensable member of the family’.

Asked what lessons he had applied from dog ownership to his current role as chief whip, he told the BBC: ‘I think it’s vitally important to recognise the critical necessity of hugging people close at certain times and then at other times rubbing people’s noses in it.’

Victorious Mr Flello said he was 'thrilled' for Diesel, adding: 'I am very proud that he has been part of an event that promotes responsible dog ownership.'  

Other entrants included Mr Gove’s predecessor Andrew Mitchell, who was competing with his Springer Spaniel, Scarlett.

Victorious Mr Flello said he was 'delighted' for his loyal canine friend Diesel after the win yesterday afternoon

Mr Mitchell, who resigned as chief whip in September 2012 over the so-called ‘Plebgate’ scandal, said: ‘She has been this man’s canine best friend during some quite tricky times.’ 

Conservative MP Nadine Dorries and her dog Darcy were also at the show, which is organised by the Kennel Club and the Dogs Trust charity.

There were nearly as many MPs at the dog show, in Victoria Tower Gardens, next to the House of Lords, as in the sparsely populated House of Commons yesterday.

Inside the chamber, Labour MP Kevin Brennan had been sparring with Tory frontbencher William Hague about whether or not Mr Gove was ‘gainfully employed’ in his current role.

Mr Brennan said: ‘I understand the Government chief whip and his dog Snowy have just come runners-up in the Parliamentary Dog of the Year competition so I withdraw the implication he hasn’t got much to do with his time.’

Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club secretary, said the relationship between winners Mr Flello and Diesel 'really struck a chord with us and they are clearly popular with their constituents too'.

Clarissa Baldwin, chief executive of the Dogs Trust, said: 'The Westminster Dog of the Year competition is so much more than a canine beauty pageant. The competition is strictly apolitical; judges look for the dogs' good deeds and devotion to their owner - rather than policies, opinions or 'bottle'.

More than 20 dogs with owners from across the political spectrum that took part in the event.
