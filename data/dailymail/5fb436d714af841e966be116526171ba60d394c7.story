It will forever be known as the Great Escape in Kingston-upon-Hull but its architect Warren Joyce always thinks of another classic war film, when he recalls the unlikely tale.

'We were going to a game and the lads were watching the Dirty Dozen when it dawned on me,' said Joyce. 'I was on the bus in charge of this motley crew of players, cast-offs. No-one else wanted them. We couldn’t get anyone else.

'We were bottom of the Football League and I just went for hardest characters I could find. All those I’d hated playing against, those I knew were tough but had reputations for being hard to handle. I thought in a dog-fight, you need personality.'

The Dirty Dozen: Warren Joyce helped Hull avoid relegation from the Football League in 1999

Come along way: Hull take on Arsenal in the FA Cup final at Wembley on Saturday evening

It was 1998. A few months earlier, Arsenal had completed the Double, winning the FA Cup at Wembley at the end of Arsene Wenger’s first full season in England.

Hull City had ended the same campaign 90 rungs down the ladder, the third worst team in Football League, the new following season, things got worse.

They were nine points adrift at the bottom of League Two in November when Joyce, the club captain was asked to take over as player-caretaker-manager. It would get worse before it got better.

Crisis does not begin to explain the pit of trouble: plunging towards extinction, begging favours for training facilities and transport, with supporters in revolt and yet another bitter ownership struggle unfolding.

Somehow, this bunch of renegades stayed up. 'The football was very, very basic,' said Joyce. 'We had to simplify the game-plan. It was built on running power, fitness and a few counter-attacks but we had spirit.

Differing fortunes: Arsenal won the double just a few months before Hull were rooted to the bottom

'I remember standing in the tunnel and I’d see people wilt when they lined up against us. It was so loud and my lot would be staring them down. I could tell when they didn’t fancy it. They were a scary bunch but their discipline and self-control was good.

'They knew this was their chance. Most had been dumped by clubs a lot smaller than Hull City. And the common bond was no-one wanted to go out of the Football League. We won a game at Southend and we weren’t officially safe but we knew we were staying up. That trip back was unbelievable.'

Joyce was appointed permanent player-manager and within a year of the escape act had been sacked. That’s gratitude football-style.

He had kept Hull in the Football League. He stopped the rot and like the Tigers has not looked back, forging a reputation as a successful development coach, first at Leeds and then Manchester United, where he is reserve team coach.

There was a two-year spell in charge of Royal Antwerp, in Belgium, but he has otherwise resisted offers to return to management. He was linked with a return to Hull when Nigel Pearson left in 2011.

Present day: Joyce has forged a reputation as a successful development coach and is working at Man United

Joyce coached at United’s Academy when he was still playing, having acquired his coaching qualifications in his mid-twenties. It was in his blood. His father Walter also devoted his life to football as a player and coach.

James Milner, Aaron Lennon and Scott Carson were all nurtured by Joyce in his role as youth team manager at Leeds and many more at Old Trafford, including James Wilson, who scored twice on his United debut against Hull.

No-one in the East Yorkshire city will hold it against him. His hero status is assured as the man who inspired Hull City’s revival from rock bottom of the Football League to the first FA Cup final in the club’s 110-year history.
