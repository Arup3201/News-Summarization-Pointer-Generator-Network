Hillary Clinton's emails won't likely turn up many insights about the 2012 Benghazi terror attacks, according to a onetime Clinton confidant, because she can't type.

Dick Morris, who helped President Bill Clinton navigate domestic policy and led his 1996 re-election effort before imploding in his own 'bimbo eruption' scandal, wrote Monday on his blog that Mrs. Clinton 'doesn’t know how to type.' 

'That’s right. She writes everything out in longhand. Really. Anyone who has spent time in meetings with her knows about her endless yellow pads.'

Morris' insights, although dated, came as the former secretary of state visited the White House for a rare sit-down with President Barack Obama. 

Hillary Clinton visited the White House on Monday and tweeted this old photo of her hugging President Obama, while a former aide to her husband compared her email scandal to the Watergate tapes and said the Obama team likely created it to torpedo her chances in 2016

PRESSURE: Clinton is facing tough questions about what's on a private email server that hosted all her emails for the four years she spent as America's top diplomat

Former Clinton insidder Dick Morris has turned against Hillary, dishing dirt about her past and suggesting what her weak spots might be

'Her emails will most likely turn out to be very short and quick,' he predicted. 'She wouldn’t spend a lot of time pecking out long letters. No way. That’s why the Benghazi Committee needs to also look very closely at the emails on private accounts that Hillary’s closest aides, Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, maintained.'

'Anything more than a few lines were most likely written by someone else on her behalf,' Morris continued.

'There’s a reason why Hillary set up and used private emails with them for official business: all the important emails were likely written by her staff. Without access to them, we won’t know what was going on.'

A congressional panel is investigating the circumstances surrounding a 2012 terror attack on State Department facilities in Benghazi, Libya, while Clinton was secretary of state.

The revelation that she exclusively used a private email account – otuside the control or automatic archiving of the Obama administration – has fed Republican accusations that she hid her involvement in a post-attack cover-up in the weeks before the 2012 election.

At least two aides, Mills and Abedin, used personal email accounts on Clinton's private server, kept at her Chappaqua, New York home. 

Clinton's hour-long White House visit on Monday followed her appearance on a Washington, D.C. domestic policy panel hosted by the far-left Center for American Progress, and before she headlined an awards ceremony for journalists.

She took no questions from reporters at the evening event, even though her unauthorized private email server has dominated news coverage, her aides are under subpoena and she is expected to launch a presidential campaign in the coming weeks.

At the earlier liberal event, she endorsed a German-style system of subsidies to companies so they would keep more people employed.

'President Obama and Secretary Clinton enjoy catching up in
person when their schedules permit,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday in a cryptic statement to reporters.

'This afternoon they met privately for about an hour at the
White House and discussed a range of topics.' 

Moments after the White House confirmed the meeting, Clinton tweeted an old photo of her hugging Obama in the White House Situation Room.

The president has had a frosty relationship with his former top diplomat since 2008 when thetwo squared off for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Clinton damaged his ambitious quest for the brass ring by starting the rumors that he was born in Kenya and lacked a valid U.S. birth certificate. The resulting conspiracy theories have dogged his presidency since Day One. 

Clinton's Twitter message, though, defended key provisions of the president's signature health insurance overhaul, which was an extension of her own failed attempt at reform while her husband was president.

'Repeal those things? Embrace them!' she tweeted. 

Morris has a checkered past. He famously resigned from Bill Clinton's 1996 campaign two months before Election Day after it was revealed that he paid a prostitute for sex and let her listen in on his phone calls with the president.

His most recent star turn came with a lengthy Fox News Channel contract which wasn't renewed after he spectacularly blew his forecast for the 2012 presidential contest.

Mitt Romney, the once famous pollster predicted, would coast to victory and unseat Obama.

But Morris has been a thorn in Hillary's side since being bounced from her orbit in 1996.

YUK-YUK: Clinton joked about her email scandal on Monday night at a journalism award dinnner: ''No more secrecy, no more zone of privacy. After all, what good did that do me?'

When she ran for president in 2008, he penned a vicious 'fact check' article claiming that her 'main extra-curricular activity in law school was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a federal agent.' 

'Hillary interned with Bob Truehaft, the head of the California Communist Party,' for a year after her college graduation, he wrote. 

And 'she flunked the DC bar exam and only passed the Arkansas bar.'

Morris did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

But he said Sunday on a New York talk radio program that 'when we talk about "Will Hillary survive the email scandal?" – it’s just like asking in 1973 and 74, "Will Nixon survive the Watergate tapes?"' 

'By delaying the day of reckoning' for all her private emails, he said, 'she's risking shipwrecking not just her candidacy, but the entire [Democratic] Party.' 

'I think Obama wants [Elizabeth] Warren, not Hillary,' Morris added. 'I think the reason the email scandal got released to the newspapers by the administration was because they wanted to torpedo Hillary.'
