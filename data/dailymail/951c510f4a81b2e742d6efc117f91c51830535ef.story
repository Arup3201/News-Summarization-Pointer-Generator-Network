Osborne: 'A country of the size and global reach of Britain leaving would be very bad for the European Union'

A British exit from the EU would be a disaster for its other members, Chancellor George Osborne warned yesterday.

In one of his most significant speeches to date on the nation’s future in Europe, he said: ‘A country of the size and global reach of Britain  leaving would be very bad for the European Union.’

The Conservative leadership is seeking to regain the initiative on the issue of Europe following a demand from 95 backbench MPs for Britain to demand a unilateral veto over any EU edict, a move that critics say would mean the end of the  single market.

The Tories have promised that if they remain in power, an in/out referendum on British membership of the EU will be held by 2017.

Mr Osborne suggested he wanted to chart a course between hardcore Eurosceptics who want to leave the EU no matter what, and pro-Europeans who once urged Britain to enter the euro. ‘The one thing that unites those who urged Britain to join the euro and those who advocate leaving the EU is their shared conviction that any change is impossible and that there is no other way,’ he said.

‘There is another way. It is time to change the EU and to change Britain’s relationship with it and then to place  the decision in the hands of the  British people.

‘Europe urgently needs economic reform. Eurozone integration is necessary for the euro to survive, but proper legal protection for the rights of non-euro members is absolutely necessary to preserve the single market and make it  possible for Britain to remain in the EU.

‘I believe it is in no-one’s interests for Britain to come to face a choice between joining the euro or leaving the European Union.

‘We don’t want to join the euro, but also our withdrawal from a Europe which succeeded in reforming would be bad for Britain.

Decisive: The Chancellor made the comments during a pan-European conference on EU reform

Fittingly, Osborne spoke under a portrait of the great British railway engineer George Stephenson

‘And a country of the size and global reach of Britain leaving  would be very bad for the European Union.’

Mr Osborne was speaking at a conference organised by the Fresh Start group of Conservative MPs, who want a reformed relationship with Brussels, and the Open Europe think tank.

The Tories are backing a ‘red card’ system which would allow Britain to block any EU proposal, or undo an existing law, if it won the support of a small number of other EU countries.

They are also examining a proposal by Andrea Leadsom, head of the Fresh Start group and a member of the prime minister’s policy board, that Britain should be given an effective veto over financial services legislation.This would allow a member state to block any proposal if a vital national interest is at stake – an argument which could apply to Britain’s financial services industry, given its importance to the economy.

Mr Osborne warned that from 2016, under the terms of the Lisbon Treaty agreed by the last government, the Eurozone countries would be able to impose financial services legislation on nations across the EU.

He said that Britain would demand reforms to ‘protect the collective interests of non-eurozone member states’.

Warning: Mr Osborne said that from 2016, nations will be able to impose pan-European financial services laws

Mr Osborne told the conference: 'Over the last six years, the European economy has stalled. In the same period, the Indian economy has grown by a third, the Chinese economy by 50 per cent'

Mr Osborne said there was a need for reform of the EU, at a time when Europe is falling behind the rising economic powers of Asia. He added that the financial crisis of 2008 had dramatically exposed the underlying weakness of the European economy.

The Chancellor said: ‘We knew there was a competitiveness problem in Europe before the crisis.

‘But the crisis has dramatically accelerated the shifts in the tectonic economic plates that see power moving eastwards and southwards on our planet. Over the last six years, the European economy has stalled.

‘In the same period, the Indian economy has grown by a third.

‘The Chinese economy by 50 per cent. Over the next 15 years Europe’s share of global output is forecast to halve.’

Labour is refusing to back the idea of an in/out referendum. Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said: ‘The Conservative leadership seems to be spending more time negotiating with  their backbenchers than negotiating with Europe to deliver  real reform.’

But the CBI business group said Mr Osborne had set out a ‘compelling’ case, adding: ‘A growing EU is in the UK’s national interest so we must build alliances with other member states to get the reforms we need.’
