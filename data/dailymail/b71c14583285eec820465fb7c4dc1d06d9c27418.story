No need to be annoyed! Games like Angry Birds (pictured) earned more than their developers as much asthe  film industry's efforts

Apps made as much money as Hollywood took in the US last year by raking in more than $10billion (£6.5 billion).

Games such as Angry Birds and the mobile version of Facebook earned the developers behind them more than the efforts of the film industry, even with hits like The Hunger Games.

Individual developers now earn more than some Hollywood stars and apps support more jobs in America than Tinseltown.

The study showed that total App store revenues since 2008 now stand at $25 billion (£17 billion) with no sign of slowing down.

Industry analysts Asymco looked at the figures for apps sold by Apple through its iTunes service last year.

It found that the app industry is ‘healthier’ than Hollywood even though last year’s hit films included Guardians of the Galaxy, The Lego Movie and the second Hobbit film.

Producers behind huge apps such as Angry Birds, which has been sold more than 12 million times, earned Finnish Developers Rovio Entertainment, now earn more than even the biggest stars like Tom Cruise.

Asymco also pointed out that the average app developer who has a medium sized hit would earn more than their Hollywood equivalent, as many actors only earn a few thousand for small roles.

Asymco did not reveal its final figure for US box office sales but analysts have put it in the region of $10 billion (£6.5 billion), slightly lower than its app counterpart.

In their report they said: ‘This is quite a story. Put another way, in 2014 (Apple) app developers earned more than Hollywood did from box office in the US.’

Asymco said that looking at apps sold on the iTunes store was not the full picture and that its survey did not include revenue from Google’s Android operating system apps.

The popular mobile messaging application WhatsApp is now available on your office computer as well as your phone.

Sorry Apple: Whatsapp isn't able to make the option available to iPhone users for the moment

The firm launched a much rumoured web version of its service linked to the mobile app - but admitted it would not work with Apple's iPhone.

The app, acquired by Facebook last year for nearly $22 billion, unveiled the service today.

'Today, for the first time, millions of you will have the ability to use WhatsApp on your web browser,' it said in a blog post. 

WhatsApp, which claims some 500 million users, said its Web service will be a 'mirror' and would require an Internet-connected phone to work. 

The new messaging service currently only works with Google's Chrome browser and will not be available to iPhone users 'due to Apple platform limitations,' according to WhatsApp.

'Unfortunately for now, we will not be able to provide web client to our iOS users due to Apple platform limitations.' 

Facebook in October completed its buy of WhatsApp in a stock-and-cash deal. 

 

Likewise Hollywood makes other money from merchandising and other sources.

However, the trend shows how tech is taking over from the silver screen - and will continue to do so.

Asymco said that in the first week of January, a fallow time for Hollywood, consumers had already spent $500 million (£333 million) on apps through the iTunes store.

The report came as a major Hollywood studio announced that it is cutting the number of films it produces by a third and axing 500 jobs.

DreamWorks Animation, which is behind hits like Shrek, said it had to reduce costs so was shedding 18 per cent of its workforce.

According to Apple, last year the most popular paid for app for the iPhone was Minecraft, a game which allows users to build their own world from scratch.

The most popular free app in 2014 was Facebook’s messenger app, followed by messaging services WhatsApp and Snapchat.
