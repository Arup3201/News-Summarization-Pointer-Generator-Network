The boss of Npower who this week said high energy bills in Britain were due to 'draughty housing' has been accused of wasting energy at his home.

Heat images from two properties belonging to Paul Massara, the energy firm's chief executive, show evidence of poor insulation, experts say.

Mr Massara owns two homes - one a 16th century country property in Upper Wolvercote, Oxfordshire and another terrace home in Clapham, south London.

Thermal images taken of both properties show they are 'far less energy-efficient than the average family home,' Andy Smale from independent consultancy Expert Energy told the Sun on Sunday.

He added the images also indicate the houses could suffer from 'nasty drafts'.

This week, Mr Massara caused outrage by blaming Britons for sky-high energy prices.

He said households would save money if people turned off televisions and other electronic devices - and said his teenage daughters were guilty of wasting energy.

Last week the energy boss advised Britons to turn off lights and electrical appliances in order to save on energy bills

He also blamed the government for higher charges - saying eco-schemes were to blame for increasing costs. He said green taxes would push bills up to £1,500 annually by 2020 - a figure the industry regulation Ofgem disputed.

Npower raised its prices by 10.4 per cent late last year - a move predicted to affect around 3.1million customers. The company have since insisted it will reduce costs as a result of government taxes.

Speaking with BBC Radio 4's Today show, Mr Massara said: 'The reality is that we have some of the cheapest prices in Europe but our bills are some of the highest because our houses are old and not insulated.

'It’s interesting. I have two teenage daughters.

'They have been brought up in a generation that has looked at energy efficiency, that has looked at climate change.

'They would never dream of walking out of a bathroom leaving the taps running.

'And yet my teenage daughters will walk out of a room and leave the lights on and their iPod playing and the TV on quite happily.

'So I do think we need to change our approach and the way we think about energy waste.'

‘The actual unit price of energy in the UK is one of the lowest in Europe – but bills are high because British houses waste so much energy.

‘If we can increase the efficiency of the UK’s old and draughty housing, we can ensure that annual energy bills are some of the lowest too.’
