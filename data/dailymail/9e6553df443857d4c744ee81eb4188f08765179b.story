Megan Crofts and Eric Hewlett have booked their ceremony at a new venue being created by the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh

A bride-to-be is so set on having her wedding at her dream location that she has booked it for the big day, before it has even been built. 

Megan Crofts, 32, and her fiance Eric Hewlett, 36, hope to become the first couple to marry in a new venue being created by the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh.

The pair are planning to tie the knot on May 23, just eight weeks away,but their dream venue is yet to be fully built, still has workmen on site, and is 370 miles from their home.

Megan booked the venue despite never having the opportunity to tour around it in a hope that it will be completed just in time for her big day.

She says that she has pictured exactly where the ceremony will take place, where the cake will be cut, and where she will have her first dance with Eric.

Megan, a doctor who now lives in Bristol, insists she is confident everything will go as planned on the big day.

She said: 'It may seem a little risky to book a wedding in a venue that we haven't yet seen and is so far from home.

'But the team at the venue have made everything so easy, so we know we are in excellent hands.'

Despite having complete confidence in her unfinished venue Megan admits that there have been a few difficulties with planning. 

'Of course, some aspects of the planning have been difficult, for example, figuring out flowers and themes was a little tricky because we haven't seen the interior or any colour scheme.

'Living so far away has also been a little tricky, but the team at the venue have been great at liaising with my parents.' 

Megan will not be the first in her family to celebrate a milestone at the Royal college of Surgeons, as her father, Trevor, is a fellow of the College of Surgeons.

Megan says that it was celebrating with her father that first set the idea for her unfinished venue into motion.

She said: 'A retirement party was held for my dad at the Royal College and it was such a stunning setting that I always had it in mind as a potential wedding venue.

Megan continued: 'When we heard the new venue was under construction, we asked the coordinators to show us the plans and we were really sold on what the venue had to offer. 

'So after a few sneak peeks of the space during its renovation, we could really see the venue's potential as the ideal setting for our wedding.'

The new events and conference venue was formerly a language school, and will be accessible through a pillared entrance opposite the city's Festival Theatre.

Scott Mitchell, the College's commercial director, says that hosting a wedding will be a great way to unveil the building. 

He said: 'We are thrilled to have a wedding already booked at the venue.

'It is the perfect start for us and we'll be doing everything we possibly can to make sure it gives the perfect start to Megan and Eric's marriage.'
