It's one of autumn/winter's biggest sartorial trends but the humble knitted jumper wasn't always so stylish.

Now a new exhibition is to chart the history of the knit, from lowly beginnings as undergarments and utilitarian gowns to its current high fashion incarnation.

Knitwear Chanel to Westwood opens at the Fashion and Textile Museum in London next month and will include 150 rare pieces, including Chanel cardigan suits, crocheted 1930s dresses and vibrant knits by Missoni and Bill Gibb.

Accompanying the clothes will be a series of photos taken by greats such as Horst P. Horst which show off the knits in all their glamorous vintage glory.

‘Decade by decade, this incredible 
collection charts over 100 years of knitwear history,' says Celia 
Joicey, head of the Fashion and Textile Museum.

'It
 is the first exhibition of its kind to explore not only key designers 
but also technical innovations in hand, machine and industrial knitting.'

But as the exhibition makes clear, knitwear wasn't always so glamorous with knitting and crocheting long associated with functional fashion and undergarments.

That all changed when World War One broke out and wool, one of the first textiles to become scarce thanks to its use in army uniforms, became a luxury.

By the 1920s, the flexible nature of wool and increasing demand for sportier pieces resulted in knitwear becoming truly fashionable for the first time, helped along by Coco Chanel.

Key to the knit's new look was Chanel's championing of jersey, a wool-based machine woven textile, which was traditionally used to make men's pants.

Chanel, however, had other ideas and reworked the material into easy-wearing twinsets and chic frocks - an innovation considered incredibly daring in the heady days of the 1920s.

Later, the material was used to make evening dresses, as was crochet, all enlivened by metallic yarns, deco colouring and exotic details.

By the time the Second World War arrived, the jumper was a firm fixture in the fashion firmament but clothing restrictions meant that once more, women had to invent creative ways to wear it.

Many were unravelled and recycled when 
they became too tatty to bear, with multicoloured jumpers becoming a 
staple thanks to the reuse of wool taken from other garments.

That, however, was the final time that the jumper played a purely practical part in women's wardrobes and almost as soon as VE day arrived, the knit began a trajectory that took it into the heart of the fashion world.

The late 40s and early 50s saw the 'cocktail sweater' reign supreme in wardrobes around the world, thanks in no small part to the influence of Hollywood stars who wore theirs nipped in at the waist and embellished with embroidery and beading.

Later, the crocheted cocktail dress became popular, with hems shortening exponentially as the 1960s approached and throughout the decade.

With Chanel gone, Rudi Gernreich and André Courrèges led the charge to champion knitwear, embracing wool and jersey fabrics in their 
futuristic designs.

And it wasn't just designers who embraced the trend. Easier to make than the cocktail knit, short dresses became a favourite of young women all over the UK, who knitted their own using patterns published in magazines such as Vogue and Tatler.

The
 novelty knit first seen during the war years reappeared in the 70s, this time featuring bright colours and kitsch 
motifs, popularised by Fiorucci and Kenzo.

The 1970s were also a 
fertile era of fashion design, Ossie Clark, Biba, Rae Spencer Cullen for
 Miss Mouse, Bill Gibb and Mary Quant all championing knitwear.

But it wasn't until the 1980s that knitwear in its current incarnation really took off, with Vivienne Westwood, Rei Kawakubo for Comme 
des Garçons, Zandra Rhodes and Sonia Rykiel all creating sophisticated collections based on the formerly humble jumper.

By the time the 1990s and the noughties rolled around, knitwear was an established part of fashion although it hasn't completely lost its ability to astound.

From Julien MacDonald to Mark Fast and Stella McCartney, the jumper continues to inspire fashion's hottest names - and those who buy them.

'Knitwear in fashion is often taken for granted,' comments Joicey, 'but this exhibition is an opportunity to celebrate knitwear centre stage and to inspire future design directions.'

Curator Dennis Nothdruft added: ‘Knitwear is imbued with narrative and memory. This exhibition is a way of accessing other people’s stories.'

Knitwear Chanel to Westwood opens on the 19th September at the Fashion and Textiles Museum in London. See ftmlondon.org for more information.
