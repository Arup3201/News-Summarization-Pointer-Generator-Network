Controversial: This man pushed the envelope with a Halloween double reference to a deadly plane crash and a racial joke that stemmed from it

Halloween revelers hoping to get a laugh have turned to the somber subject of crashed Asiana Airlines flight 214.

Fake blood covers the men wearing tattered and crewman and captain's uniforms.

And the dark joke is made all the more timely with fake name tags of the mock Asian crew names infamously shown on live television by San Francisco newscasters.

'Capt. Sum Ting Wong,' reads a man's bloody, tattered captain's uniform in a photo posted to Instagram by user PREpresents.

He wears a flight captain's hat and a big smile. The back of his shirt reads, 'Capt. Wi Tu Lo' right above 'Ho Lee Fuk.'

These
 are the names of fake Asiana flight 214 pilots posted in a pranked news 
segment by staff at local San Francisco television station KTVU after 
the plane crashed at the city's airport, killing three little girls and 
injuring over 100 in July.

'Hahaha
 wow man,' replied Instagrammer dtm_photography. 'I have friends who 
might literally try to fight you if they saw this, I say it's the best 
costume I've seen this year!!!'

Two sides to every joke: The Halloween reveler thought it would be funny to go as an injured air captain and name him Wi Tu Lo and Sum Ting Wong after an infamous prank that showed up on TV state KTVU after Asiana flight 214 crashed

Professionals? These guys thought of it, too. Their nametags reead Wi Tu Lo, Sum Ting Wong, and Ho Lee Fuk and blogger AngryAsianMan says' they're actual flight attendants

The man in PREpresents' picture isn't the only one to come up with the controversial costume, however.

A
 trio of men at a Chicago gay bar costume party got together over the 
weekend, according to AngryAsianMan, and their costumes were similarly 
themed.

Each of them wore a 
flight crew-type outfit, makeup that looked like injuries, and a name 
tag: Wi Tu Lo, Sum Ting, Wong, and Ho Lee Fuk.

According to AngryAsianMan, the men are actually flight attendants for Continental/United Airlines.

'I really hope they don't show up to work dressed like this on Halloween,' the blogger writes.

In poor taste: KTVU News read these names live 
on television stating that the National Transportation Safety 
Board had confirmed that these were the pilots of Asiana 214. It was a prank that ended up getting several veteran newscasters fired
