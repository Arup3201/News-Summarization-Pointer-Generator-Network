Shola Ameobi could be lining up alongside David Villa and Frank Lampard at New York City FC.

The out-of-contract Newcastle striker, 32, is also wanted by Hull City and Sydney FC in Australia.

Villa will have a spell later this year with Melbourne City FC, just renamed from Melbourne Heart. Villa will be on loan from sister club New York City for a 10-game spell.

Moving on: Shola Ameobi is leaving Newcastle after 402 senior appearances

The future: Ameobi could join David Villa at MLS outfit New York City

Unconfirmed: Frank Lampard is also expected to move to New York City

It was reported earlier in the week that Sydney had already opened talks with the Nigeria international's representative about the chances of a move.

Ameobi, born in Nigeria but raised on Tyneside, was handed a senior debut for the Magpies as a teenager by then manager Sir Bobby Robson when he was introduced as a substitute in a 0-0 Barclays Premier League draw with Chelsea at St James' Park in September 2000.

In total, he made 402 senior appearances for the club and scored 79 goals, and while he was not always a favourite with fans, his efforts were appreciated by successive managers.

However, current boss Alan Pardew, who is looking to make significant changes to his squad this summer, decided not to offer Ameobi a new contract with his existing deal due to expire at the end of the month.
