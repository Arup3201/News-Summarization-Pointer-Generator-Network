John O'Shea is still getting used to the sight of his old team-mate Ryan Giggs in the Manchester United dugout. 

When the Sunderland defender lines up against United on Sunday, Giggs will be the only familiar face still remaining from his 12 years at the club.

But O’Shea is just glad he no longer has to try to stop the flying Welshman. ‘You would try anything,’ he said with a laugh. 'It will be strange, especially seeing him in that coaching role.

Strange: John O'Shea says he is still getting used to seeing Ryan Giggs in the Manchester United dugout

We meet again: The Sunderland defender lines up against United on Sunday with Giggs a familiar face

‘It was weird going down to Old Trafford last season and seeing him as the manager. It was incredible, you know, but I’m sure it’s given him a taste of what’s to come.’

The Republic of Ireland defender was not about to do Giggs any favours when the latter took temporary charge at United for four games at the end of last season.

His first match was a 4-0 win against Norwich but in the second they were up against a Sunderland side scrapping desperately for Premier League survival, captained by O’Shea. Sunderland recorded a shock 1-0 win that helped keep them up and piled more misery on United’s dismal season.

‘When we won there it wasn’t nice for Giggsy in that sense when he was the manager, but for us it was so crucial for Premier League survival last season. That was a special day,’ he said.

O’Shea’s suggestion that Giggs will one day become United manager is perhaps indicative of the new United. More than a quarter of a century of stability under Sir Alex Ferguson was ripped apart by David Moyes’s disastrous reign.

Louis van Gaal has only been at the helm for three months but there is already supporter unrest after their opening day defeat by Swansea, and that will grow considerably if they do not beat Sunderland on Sunday.

Play: O'Shea admits ‘it was weird going down to Old Trafford last season and seeing (Giggs) as the manager'

Battle: O'Shea and Giggs will go head-to-head again on Sunday as United visit the Stadium of Light 

It's not too late to play MailOnline Fantasy Football. There's £1,000 to be won EVERY WEEK by the highest-scoring manager 

But the club are virtually unrecognisable to the one where O’Shea won five League titles, a Champions League trophy, an FA Cup and three League Cups. There is no Paul Scholes, no Nemanja Vidic, no Rio Ferdinand or Patrice Evra, players O’Shea spent almost every day with — in training, on the pitch and travelling the world pillaging silverware.

‘They’ve lost a lot of experience along the way,’ O’Shea explained. ‘It’s going to be an interesting season, everyone is waiting to see how they’re doing I’m sure they’ll be looking to definitely get back to the top side of the table.

‘Expectation levels are always sky high and that won’t change. Obviously, after last season, people are saying, “Oh, they need to get to the top four, they need to get this.” Expectation is always very high, they always expect to be challenging for every trophy and that won’t change with last season and with the new rivals along the way.

‘They’ve got a very experienced manager who has been successful wherever he’s been. He looks a great character when he’s being interviewed. He came across very well with the Dutch team during the World Cup. I’m sure they’ll be excited they’ve made one or two additions to their squad.’

O’Shea, 33, has his own new addition this summer with the birth of his daughter, Ruby, on May 1, to add to his son Alfie. He hasn’t let it affect his pre-season preparation, though.

‘That is where there is an advantage of being able to shift the family back to Ireland for a couple of weeks,’ he added. ‘Back to see the family and the grandparents.’

Even without Giggs in Van Gaal’s the starting XI, or any of the players O’Shea spent those golden years with, he will need to be at his freshest on Sunday afternoon.

Once upon a time: United have somewhat changed since O'Shea's time at the club with players departing

Eager: O'Shea knows it will be tough because 'expectation levels are always sky high and that won’t change'
