Burnley striker Danny Ings will step out at Anfield on Wednesday looking to boost his side's Premier League survival hopes at the expense of the team he has been strongly linked with a move to at the end of the season.

Brendan Rodgers has refused to be drawn on speculation suggesting that Ings, who is out of contract at the end of the campaign, will move to Liverpool.

But if he does sign a contract at Anfield, will he be good enough to make the grade? Sportsmail's reporters give their verdict.

Yes, he is good enough to make the step up. 

It is no mean effort scoring nine goals in the Barclays Premier League for a side that has struggled to get results and Ings has never been found wanting at the biggest stadiums.

He was outstanding in Burnley’s 3-1 loss at Old Trafford last month, his energy and intensity setting him apart that night. It was not a one-off because he has attracted positive reviews all season.

Liverpool will overhaul their striking department in the summer, with potentially three players moving – Rickie Lambert, Fabio Borini and Mario Balotelli – and a move for Ings would make sense from both a playing style and an economic point of view.

He will have to raise his game again should he eventually arrive at Anfield, but that won’t be a problem. 

Ings has been doing that for the last two years and he will welcome the challenge.

Danny Ings is one of those players who doesn't have one quality that makes him stand out, but he doesn't have an obvious weakness either.

He is an intelligent player and at 22 has the potential to get better. He is a good finisher but his tally of nine this season is unremarkable and five fewer than Charlie Austin at QPR for example.

Ings could make the step up to a big club but there is no guarantee. You suspect Liverpool's real interest in him is due to John W Henry's moneyball approach to the game.

Why wouldn't you take a promising 22-year-old on a Bosman given you could sell him in two years for a handsome profit, even if he doesn't become a first-team regular?

There was a moment when it became clear to me that Ings was good enough to make the grade at the very highest level and it came early in last month’s defeat at Manchester United. 

The way he showed Chris Smalling to the front post before checking back and heading in Burnley’s goal – by now unmarked – at the far post told you everything you need to know about his natural instincts as a goal scorer. It was high-class finishing. 

Ings' form has also led to talk that England manager Roy Hodgson (left) will include him in his next squad

Earlier in the season – as he started the campaign slowly – I wasn’t sure but he has found his feet now and has emerged as a safe bet for the next England squad. 

On that note, I wrote a story last season saying that Ings was being watched by Roy Hodgson’s staff and was likely to figure in the national set-up during the Euro qualifiers. I remember one of my colleagues laughing. He isn’t laughing any more….

CHRIS WHEELER 

There’s no doubting the drive and determination of a striker who was playing for Dorchester Town in the Conference South a little over four years ago, and Ings will be desperate to put on a performance at Anfield.

Is he good enough to make the step up to Liverpool? Compared with the players Brendan Rodgers currently has at his disposal, you would have to say yes.

Ings has scored nine goals in the Premier League for a Burnley side that has spent the entire season battling the odds – the same amount as Manchester City’s new £25m signing Wilfried Bony and Arsenal’s Olivier Giroud, and more than Liverpool forwards Daniel Sturridge, Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert, Fabio Borini and Lazar Markovic put together.

Ings has scored the same number of Premier League goals as Wilfried Bony and Olivier Giroud

Ings is only 22 and fits the profile of player that Liverpool often pursue in the transfer market

A player who scored 26 goals in the Championship last season has also hit four in seven appearances for England Under 21s to stake his claim for a senior international call-up, so there is little doubt that he is capable of rising to the challenge.

Ings is not excessively tall or powerful, but he is quick and possesses great movement and anticipation in and around the penalty box. Most importantly of all, he has a goalscorer’s instinct.

And at the age of 22, he is young enough to take his game to another level under a coach like Rodgers.
