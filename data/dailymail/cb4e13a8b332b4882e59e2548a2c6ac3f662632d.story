It looks like a second-rate soft porn film...except for the uniforms.

The two ‘air stewardesses’ stripping off in footage which has become a YouTube sensation appear to be wearing genuine British Airways outfits.

So it is hardly surprising the airline has launched an investigation to establish whether the girls are really on its staff.

Warning: graphic content

Video: Two women dressed in British Airways uniforms filmed themselves washing in a bathtub

Erotica: The two women rubbed each other with soap and filmed the encounter to put on YouTube

The video, showing the pair stripping off and cavorting together in a bath, has been watched more than 140,000 times online.

It
is also said to have been widely circulated among employees at BA. One 
viewer wrote on YouTube: ‘Reminds me why I became a pilot.’

Last night the identities of the women remained unclear.

The
eight-minute film, entitled Sexy Two Air Hostesses in Uniform, seems to
have been shot in a hotel bathroom, though it is impossible to confirm 
the location.

Investigation: BA is now attempting to identify the women and track them down

A spokesman for the airline said: ‘We have no evidence to suggest that the two women are or have ever been BA employees.’

It was recorded in a hotel bathroom during a stopover between flights, according to The Sun.

The women climb into a bathtub, turn the shower on and start rubbing each other with soap.

One then takes off her uniform, with the help of the other, as the pair's antics become even more explicit.

X-rated: The video has attracted more than 113,000 views since it first appeared on YouTube

It is not entirely clear whether the women are genuinely BA stewardesses or are just wearing the airline's uniforms.

A spokesman for BA said the company was trying to identify the women and track them down.

'We're aware of the video,' he said. 'Investigations continue to establish their identity.'

YouTube users reacted positively to the footage, with one joking: 'Reminds me why I became a pilot.'
