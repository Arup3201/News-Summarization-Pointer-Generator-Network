Aston Villa and Leicester have been charged with failing to control their players after a feisty Midlands derby ended with both sets of players fighting on the pitch.

Leicester beat Aston Villa 1-0 on Saturday, but tempers frayed in the latter stages after a studs-up challenge from Foxes' midfielder Matty James.

James was sent off by referee Michael Oliver for the challenge on Jores Okore, while Aston Villa's Ciaran Clark also saw red for events following the tackle.

After the incident, a mass confrontation ensued, spilling into the tunnel after the full-time whistle. 

On Tuesday, it was revealed that both teams had been charged by the Football Association for their part in the incident.

A statement from the FA read:

'Both Aston Villa and Leicester City have been charged by The FA following their fixture on January 10 2015.

'It is alleged that during added time at the end of the second half both clubs failed to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion and/or refrained from provocative behaviour.

'The clubs have until 6pm on 16 January 2015 to respond to the charge.'
