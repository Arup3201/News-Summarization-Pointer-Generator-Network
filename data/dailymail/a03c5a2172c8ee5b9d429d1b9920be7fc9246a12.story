McDonald's doesn't think its employees should eat the food they serve.

The fast food giant has advised employees to avoid meals with burgers and fries and to eat healthier options like salad and sandwiches.

The advice was dispensed on the now-infamous McResource Line, the employees-only website that has told workers to sell their things and get second jobs to make ends meet.

Good idea, bad idea: McDonald's didn't think its employees should eat the food they serve, as seen in this graph from their staff website McResource Line, which was pulled down this week

The advice is given with graphics depicting the ‘unhealthy choice’ and the ‘healthier choice.’ McDonald’s own food is in the former column.

Despite featuring a vast array of deep fried delicacies, the Golden Arches reminds employees that ‘avoiding items that are deep fried are your best bet.’

The sensible advice also tells McWorkers to ‘limit the extras such as cheese, bacon and mayonnaise.’ Tasty add-ons that are staples of many menu items they serve on a daily basis.

A hamburger, fries and soda are warned against, because ‘eating a diet high in fat puts people at rick for becoming overweight.’

Many locations offer steep food discounts and short breaks to employees, virtually forcing them to eat the unhealthy food, often forcing the hand of workers without the time or means to eat elsewhere.

Solid advice: Don't eat at McDonald's. The fast food chain were forced to admit the embarrassing and 'outdated' information on their site has lead to a temporarily shutdown for 'upgrades'

‘It is hard to eat a healthy diet when you eat at fast-food restaurants often,’ the advice continues. ‘Many foods are cooked with a lot of fat, even if they are not trans fats. Many fast-food restaurants do not offer any lower-fat foods.’

The world’s largest fast food chain wants employees to eat elsewhere.

‘Eat at places that offer a variety of salads, soups, and vegetables,’ the site says.

This advice comes after a series of tips telling employees find second jobs, apply for food stamps and sell their things to weather a financial crisis. 

The site also gave advice on how to tip au pairs, doormen, personal trainers and pool boys.

A spokesperson told CNBC that the website has been ‘taken entirely out of context.'
