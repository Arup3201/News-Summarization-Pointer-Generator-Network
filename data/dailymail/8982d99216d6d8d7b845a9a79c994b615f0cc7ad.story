A 14-year-old girl from Arizona who went missing last Thursday was discovered dead in a Dumpster the following day, and police are now saying that foul play was involved. 

Two women digging through the trash container for aluminum cans at the Sun Garden Apartments in Mesa early Friday morning discovered the body of Claudia Ann Lucero, police announced yesterday.

A resident of the complex told Phoenix TV station KPHO that she heard shouting about 11.30pm Thursday.

Brief life: Claudia Ann Lucero, 14, a high school freshman from Mesa, Arizona, was found dead in a Dumpster just two hours after being reported missing

Shocking discovery: Two women rifling through the contents of this Dumpster on Brown Road came across a dead body, which was later identified as the missing 14-year-old

Shortly after that, two distraught people ran upstairs and knocked on her door asking to use her phone to call police because they said there was a body in a trash container, the unidentified woman said.

‘Homicide detectives responded to the scene and began their investigation into this obviously suspicious death,’ said Sgt. Tony Landato, a police spokesman.

Landato said the teen was last seen at about 6.30am Thursday at her Mesa home. The girl's mother reported her as a possible runaway at 10pm that day, and her body turned up in the trash about two hours later.

Last night, some 100 friends and neighbors gathered outside the housing complex on East Brown Road for an emotional candlelight vigil to remember a girl who was described as popular and chatty.

Bursting with life: Friends and family said Claudia was talkative, friendly, loved hop hop music, fashion and makeup

Memorial: More than 100 people gathered near the spot where Lucero's body was found, leaving behind flowers, candles and toys

Claudia was a freshman at Westwood High School, where her classmates said she excelled in her studies, was friendly to everyone and loved making people laugh.

The raven-haired 14-year-old loved hip hop music, swimming and had many friends, according to her grief-stricken aunt Margaret Lucero, AZCentral reported. 

'She used to sit right next to me in one of my classes,' classmate Jose Fuentes told MyFox Phoenix. 'Counselors came in, told us she had passed... I was in shock, couldn't really believe it. Honestly, I just got this feeling in my stomach, like it hurts.'

Lupe Lucero, a cousin, said the bubbly teen was interested in fashion and makeup.

The girl is survived by her three brothers. Her older sibling, Ricky Lucero, wrote an impassioned eulogy on his Facebook account Monday night, expressing his love for his slain baby sister.

'Why did you have to go lil sis,' Mr Lucero wrote in all caps. 'Wish you could had told [sic] me if there was something wrong or it someone was stalking you or talking dirty... I would have took [sic] care of the problem.'

Police are not saying how Claudia Lucero die, or whether her murder was preceded by a sexual assault.

A makeshift memorial has since sprung up outside the apartment complex on Brown Road, with mourners leaving roses, toys and candles in the teen's memory.

The victim’s family have made a public plea asking any witnesses to the crime to come forward. 

'That's my sister. For them to throw her in the trash like that just tells me my sister was trash, and she wasn't trash,' Ricky Lucero told the station WAVE3. 'She wasn't trash at all.'
