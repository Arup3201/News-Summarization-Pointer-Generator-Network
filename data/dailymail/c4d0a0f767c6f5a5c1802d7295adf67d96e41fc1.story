Six-year-old Ellie Mae Wile is celebrating a huge milestone after entering remission from her cancer.

The primary school student, from Horsham, has spent a physically and emotionally draining past couple of years battling leukaemia. 

While fighting the deadly disease, Ellie Mae also succumbed to E.coli and pneumonia, and she had to learn to walk again after the cancer treatment severely damaged her bones. 

Ellie Mae, six, from Horsham, was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in 2013. She also battled with E.coli and pneumonia and had to learn to walk again after cancer treatment damaged her bones 

It is a miracle that Ellie Mae is has made such a full recovery as her cancer was missed several times by doctors before she was finally diagnosed. 

She first showed signs of illness aged four, when her concerned parents took her to the local GP surgery after she started suffering from lethargy and a string of other ailments.

Over the course of a few months, they made repeated visits to the doctors and nearby hospital but were usually sent home with antibiotics.  

Speaking to FEMAIL about discovering the real reason Ellie Mae was always pale, tired and had aching legs, her mother Nikki Wile, said: 'We were on a family holiday in Plymouth and began to worry because she complained about lethargy and aching legs and wanted to use a pushchair.

'She was starting school soon and I thought "this can't be right" but we had been back and forth to the doctors and no one had picked up on anything.' 

Ellie Mae was always pale, tired and had aching legs. But her mother Nikki Wile really began to worry when her daughter complained about lethargy and aching legs and wanted to use a pushchair at the age of four

The chemotherapy drugs that were saving Ellie Mae's life were also suppressing her immune system. She withdrew into herself, unable to understand why everyone was 'hurting' her but her parents remained as positive as they could by trying to make hospital stays 'fun' with arts and crafts

It wasn't until one of Ellie Mae's aunts,who worked as a  receptionist at the local hospital, recognised the telltale signs for leukaemia and advised Nikki to take her daughter for a blood test.

Nikki said: 'She noticed some tell-tale signs such as tiny red spots around her eyes and on her nose, she also noticed how easily her skin bruised after wearing a helmet while she was on a scooter.' 

The aunt advised Nikki and her partner Jim to take Ellie Mae straight to hospital and demand a blood test. 

She was admitted within the hour.

Nikki said: 'We presumed they might say she had an iron deficiency but nothing prepared us for the news we received.'

Nikki and Jim were taken into a private room and told their little girl had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

Speaking about receiving the news, Nikki said: 'Never in a million years did we expect to hear that. 

'That day we had been running around a farm looking at the animals and now we were frantically trying to find a bed for our little girl in a cancer ward.' 

Jim added: 'Nothing can prepare you for that moment. Shock, dread, fear, anguish and desperation were just some of the words that hit us and lived with us over the next months.

'We felt like we were being driven in a car we had no control over. 

'Things were explained to us but we found it so hard to take in among the tears and anxiety. 

'We went through hopeless bouts of self-doubt, questioning "Why our daughter?".'

Ellie Mae was finally able to start school in May, although she had to use a wheelchair and frame as she re-learned to walk. Three days into the summer holidays she broke her left leg, due to a calcium deficiency caused by the effects of the chemotherapy and steroids

Ellie Mae was transferred to Bristol Children’s Hospital and given the first of many chemotherapy drugs before being transferred to the Royal Marsden Hospital in Sutton.

But there was worse to come. The chemotherapy drugs that were saving Ellie Mae’s life were also suppressing her immune system. 

Ellie Mae also withdrew into herself, unable to understand why everyone was 'hurting' her. 

Her speech dropped away and the steroids she was taking brought on mood swings and tantrums. Her leg muscles were also affected, making it difficult to walk.

After 10 days in hospital, they were allowed to take Ellie home. 

For the next six weeks, they were in and out of hospital with a series of infections and also for her chemotherapy treatment. 

Then one November morning, her temperature spiked and she had to be admitted to Worthing Hospital, where her condition began to deteriorate rapidly.

She was rushed back to the Royal Marsden where she was diagnosed with E.coli and pneumonia and very low potassium levels. 

Speaking about Ellie Mae's response to the ordeal, Nikki said: 'While she will never now how close to death she was, it suddenly clicked that Ellie Mae was going to get better and things became more positive' (Ellie Mae pictured before her diagnosis)

Jim said: 'Over the next three weeks, Ellie Mae drifted in and out of consciousness. She lost any appetite she had and withdrew further into herself. She appeared to be losing the fight.'

But after four weeks Ellie Mae was allowed home with a feed pump and spent another 57 days in isolation because of her suppressed immune system.

Speaking about the 'intense' months that followed, Nikki said: 'She couldn't walk and was in and out of hospital constantly. For eight weeks, she was in home isolation to minimise infection risk due to her low immune system. 

'Her medicine was making her ill and she struggled to understand why this was happening. She rejected her father and grandparents and only wanted me, it was extremely tough.' 

Jim added: 'This raised our stress levels because inside we were crying too.'

Ellie Mae was finally able to start school in May, although she had to use a wheelchair and frame as she re-learned to walk. 

Three days into the summer holidays she broke her left leg, caused by the weakening effects of the chemotherapy and steroids and she has also broken her arm twice since.

Fortunately, Ellie Mae's schoolmates were extremely supportive though, taking it in turns to care for her and never questioning why she had no hair or used a frame to walk.

Nikki said: 'While she will never know how close to death she was, Ellie Mae has fully appreciated her illness. 

Nikki said: 'About four months in, she accepted what was happening, and was able to deal with it and that helped things became more positive.' 

Nikki and Jim also employed positive tactics to keep all of their spirits up. 

'It's amazing how many decorations you can make out of sick bowls,' laughed Nikki.

The trio attended an event hosted by Samantha Cameron, right, on Tuesday at Downing Street for the launch of Cancer Research's new campaign. Rochelle Humes, pictured with Beau Apsley, also attended 

They also turned to several charities for support, including the Rainbow Trust, who would come and sit with Ellie Mae so that they could grab a coffee and recharge their batteries. 

Nikki also says the value of Facebook support groups, where she forged many great virtual friendships with families who were going through the same as theirs, were crucial.

She said: 'We won't know for five more years whether she is cured but we take each day as it comes.'

Jim added: 'Some people might say we were unfortunate in what has happened to our daughter and what we have gone through but I believe we were lucky. 

'The prognosis could have been worse and the fallout more severe.' 

Ellie Mae and Nikki attended an event hosted by Samantha Cameron last week at Downing Street for the launch of Cancer Research's new campaign ‘Cancer Research UK Kids & Teens’.

The campaign aims to accelerate research and find kinder treatments and cures to beat cancer in younger people. 

Twenty children and teenagers and their families travelled from across the UK to join celebrity supporters of the campaign including Peter Andre and his fiancée Emily MacDonagh, The Saturdays’ Rochelle Humes, as well as presenters Kirstie Allsopp, Charlotte Hawkins, Sara Cox and Donna Air.

Speaking about the event, Nikki said: 'It was so fantastic and great to see the kids enjoying themselves. I will fondly cherish the image of Ellie Mae running down the corridors of 10 Downing Street, playing hide and seek with the other children.'
