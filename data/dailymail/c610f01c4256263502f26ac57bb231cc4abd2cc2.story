Former Scunthorpe boss Russ Wilcox has been named the new manager of League Two side York.

The Minstermen have moved quickly following the departure of Nigel Worthington earlier this week.

Chairman Jason McGill told the club's official website: 'We believe Russ is the right person to take this club forward. He has excellent managerial experience and a track record of success in League Two.

Nigel Worthington confirmed his resignation as York City manager on Monday after only one win this season

'He is a hard-working individual and an excellent motivator and someone who shares our vision for the club now and in the future.'

Wilcox, 50, was sacked by Scunthorpe earlier this month after a poor run of results in Sky Bet League One.

He had taken over last December following a spell as caretaker boss at his former club and led the Iron to promotion last season having finished runners-up to Chesterfield in League Two.Â
