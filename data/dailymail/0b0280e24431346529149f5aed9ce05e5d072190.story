Charged: Nadiya Savchenko, 31, was abducted by Russia and charged with involvement in the 'murder' of two Moscow journalists, Kiev claimed yesterday

Russia abducted a glamorous Ukrainian military pilot before charging her with involvement in the 'murder' of two Moscow journalists, Kiev claimed yesterday.

Nadiya Savchenko, 31, was seized inside Ukraine and smuggled across the border for prosecution, alleged the country's Foreign Ministry in the latest dispute between the ex-Soviet countries.

She has been charged in connection with the deaths of journalists Igor Kornelyuk and Anton 
Voloshin, from state television channel Rossiya.

The pair were killed on June 18 
after being hit with shrapnel during an attack by Ukrainian forces near 
the city of Lugansk.

The Moscow Investigative Committee, the equivalent of America's FBI, said Savchenko was detained after posing as a refugee on the frontier without any identity documents.

'Having
 gained the coordinates of a group of Russian journalists and other 
civilians near Lugansk, Savchenko passed them on to the combatants,' it said.

But yesterday, Kiev pointed out that the pilot had been interviewed as a prisoner of pro-Russian 
separatists in eastern Ukraine in late June.

This suggests she was in captivity when she supposedly freely crossed the border, it claimed.

The Foreign Ministry, which has issued a 'categorical protest' demanding Savchenko's 'unconditional release', alleged the pilot was kidnapped in Ukraine and smuggled into Russia, before being held in detention in Voronezh.

It said the case 'is further proof that 
terrorists plan and carry out their crimes in Ukraine in close 
cooperation with Russian security services'.

It added: 'By openly abducting citizens of Ukraine on the territory of their state, the Russian authorities not only violate all international norms but also exceed basic norms of decency and morality.'

Savchenko is regarded as a role model for women in Ukraine, having earlier served in Iraq in a peacekeeping mission.

It is believed she was wounded in fighting before her alleged seizure by pro-Moscow fighters.

After being captured in June, Savchenko 
reportedly admitted killing pro-Russians, telling local media at the time: 'I was killing people.'

Yesterday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin demanded the pilot's' 'unconditional release'.

It comes as rebels in Donetsk have vowed to fight on against Ukrainian forces which have surrounded the key eastern city.

Insurgent leader Igor Strelkov, accused by Kiev of being a Russian intelligence officer, said: 'We are taking urgent measures to prepare Donetsk for battle.'
