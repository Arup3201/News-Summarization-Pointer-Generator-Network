A woman attending a Britney Spears concert died after falling from a fairground ride outside the venue.

The 31-year-old was on the Tip Top ride next to the O2 arena in Dublin when she was thrown to the ground last night.

She has been named locally as Siobhan Healy, from Willsborough, outside Ballinlough in Co Roscommon, who was understood to be living in Dublin.

Britney, pictured performing earlier this month in France, is currently touring Europe as part of her Femme Fatale tour

Gardai said the incident happened at around 11.20pm. It is believed the woman died instantly and her body was removed from the scene

The accident happened after huge swathes of the east of Ireland were hit by almost a month's rain in 24 hours.

In Dublin, the Dodder, Poddle and Camac rivers burst their banks and a major emergency was declared in the capital.

Councillor Michael McGreal, a 
neighbour and family friend, said Ms Healy was an only child and her 
mother, Doreen, had lost her husband several years ago.

"The community is very shocked," he said.

"I know her family very well, we are all very upset."

Gardai said the incident happened at 
around 11.20pm at the Point Village next to the O2, where Ms Healy had 
earlier been to see Spears, who is touring Europe with her Femme Fatale 
show.

It is believed she fell from a ride 
called the Tip Top, which was run by funfair operator Kenneth McFadden, 
owner of McFadden's Entertainment.
Mr McFadden said he was devastated for the woman's family.

"We can't say (what happened), it all happened so quick," he said. "We are just in bits at the moment, we are just devastated."

Mr McFadden, whose son also runs 
fairground rides at the site, said he was not going to open for business
 last night because of the severe weather, but decided to do so after 
the rain cleared up.

The fairground operator said he has had the Tip Top ride for four or five years and never had any problems with it.

Investigators are hoping the incident was captured on CCTV, he added.

A spokesman for the O2 arena said Mr 
McFadden rents the ground at the adjacent Point Village from Crosby 
Properties to run his ride during concerts.

"Kenneth McFadden, owner of 
McFadden's Entertainment, confirms that a tragic incident took place 
last night at one of the attractions we operate," said the O2 spokesman.

"It is being investigated by the gardai and we are, of course, co-operating fully with them."

It is believed Ms Healy died instantly and her body was removed from the scene.

The area was sealed off ahead of a forensic examination by Garda technical experts.

Garda officers at Store Street have launched an inquiry.

It is understood there were a number of fairground rides outside O2 for the event.

The Health and Safety Authority said it was not investigating the incident as it did not appear to be a work-related accident.

Fans waiting to enter the venue 
earlier in the evening were battered by the heavy rain which caused 
widespread flooding and left public transport severely disrupted.

Irish weather service Met Eireann has issued a severe weather warning for Ulster and East Leinster.
