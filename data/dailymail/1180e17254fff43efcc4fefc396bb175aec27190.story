Things have only gotten messier at Dartmouth College in the weeks since a former fraternity brother went public with hazing allegations involving swimming in and swallowing vomit.

Senior Andrew Lohse brought the issue to the forefront in January, when he wrote a column in the school newspaper describing 'dehumanizing' experiences he witnessed at Sigma Alpha Epsilon. 

During hazing and throughout the year, the fraternity pressured pledges to swim in a kiddie pool of rotten food, vomit and other bodily fluids; eat omelettes made of vomit and chug cups of vinegar, the fraternity member said.

Animal house: More than a quarter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon's brotherhood had been accused of hazing after a former pledge said he and others were forced to swim in a kiddie pool of vomit and other bodily fluids

He called those activities the norm 
rather than the exception on the Ivy League campus, and he criticized 
the administration for not doing enough when he made anonymous 
complaints last year.

The 
week after the column was published, more than 100 faculty members wrote
 to the administration, describing hazing as an 'open secret' and 
calling on the administration to set up an independent commission to 
address it.

However,
 the fraternity's president, Brendan Mahoney, said all 27 accused 
students face identical charges relating to new member recruitment in 
the fall of 2011 in an email to the Associated Press.

But by that time, the fraternity had 
gotten rid of any traditions that would be 'deemed problematic' by the 
administration, Mahoney said, and no current members of SAE were members
 in 2009 when Mr Lohse was a pledge.

As
 for Mr Lohse's graphic allegations, 'None of these practices, and 
nothing remotely close to hazing, occurred at our pledge events in 
2011,' he said in an email to The Associated Press.

Hazing
 has been a problem with fraternities as long as they have existed. In 
fraternities, it is often seen part of a ritual necessary to joining the
 brotherhood. Throughout the decades, acts and laws have been imposed at
 some universities to prevent such practices.

Brotherhood: 27 members of the fraternity face identical charges, according to SAE's president (there is no suggestion that any of those pictured here face charges)

Taking action: More than more than 100 faculty members wrote to the Dartmouth administration, describing hazing as an 'open secret' and calling on the administration to set up a task force to address it

The
 college has since formed a task force and brought hazing charges 
through its judicial affairs office against the fraternity and more than
 a quarter of its members, including Mr Lohse.

Dean of the College Charlotte Johnson declined to comment on those charges.

Hazing, considered a rite of passage by some fraternities, has been largely condemned and banned by colleges and universities with Greek life. However, what goes in the privacy of the fraternity’s houses is much different than their public image.

Hazing incidents have emerged across the nation where recruits were forced to complete physically challenging, often humiliating tasks like consuming large amounts of alcohol in short time spans, getting paddled, being forced to eat animal parts, and being stripped naked.

Lighter forms of hazing like drinking games are also banned by nearly every university's panhellenic associations.

Mr
 Lohse did not specify in his column whether all alleged abuses occurred
 in 2009 or later, and he declined to comment Monday, citing an 
agreement with another publication.

Dartblog.com,
 a blog written by former students about the college, obtained a copy of
 the letter notifying Mr Lohse of the charges against him. According to 
the letter, Mr Lohse is accused of threatening physical harm to new 
fraternity members, putting other students in fear for their safety 
and/or engaging in hazing during the fall 2011 term.

He
 also is accused providing alcohol to underage students, providing drugs
 and/or providing alcohol to obviously intoxicated individuals during 
the same time period.

The 
charges filed were identical for the other individuals, 'even though 
Lohse's tale does not describe them as engaged in the same activities,' 
said Mr Mahoney, who said students have been charged 'without a shred of
 real evidence.'

Administrators, he suggested, are panicking in the face
 of bad press.

'We do know that Dartmouth has come in for a lot of bad publicity because of Mr Lohse's allegations. We hope Dartmouth's administration will focus on the evidence rather than on a public relations strategy,' he said.

Ms Johnson, the college administrator, strongly denied both Mr Lohse's allegation that the college failed to act on his initial complaints and Mahoney's suggestion that the recent charges were brought to quell criticism.

She said the administration already had been working hard to tackle the issue of hazing and was not simply responding to the recent allegations and faculty pressure.

For example, the college hired a new director of Greek organizations who had been credited with turning around the fraternity and sorority system at another college, has hired two sexual assault coordinators and is in the process of hiring another alcohol and drug abuse counsellor. 

The college sees hazing as part of a larger problem, tied together with binge drinking and sexual assault, and has taken steps to address all three through the National College Health Improvement Project it launched last year.

'Clearly we put our resources where our mouth is,' she said.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon provides all of its members with anti-hazing and risk management education and, several years ago, launched a comprehensive anti-hazing program called We Stand Together.

'This idea that we have somehow thrown up our hands, said there's nothing we can do about hazing or other high risk behaviour going on college campuses is a complete mischaracterization.'

Ms Johnson also said college officials did everything they could when Mr Lohse made his anonymous complaints, but the tips he provided didn't pan out.

There are credibility issues surrounding
 Mr Lohse’s  include Mr Lohse's 2010 arrest and conviction for cocaine 
possession and witness tampering and a 2011 disorderly conduct 
conviction, following a confrontation with a security officer during 
Homecoming Weekend festivities.

'The opinion of most students is that he has a bone to pick with both the college and SAE,' said Stephanie Pignatiello, a senior who said that while she believes hazing happens, she thinks Mr Lohse's claims are greatly exaggerated.

But she also agrees with him that the college hasn't done much to solve the problem.

'They seem to be largely absent,' she said. 'I don't think much will change at the administrative level.'

Sophomore Stuart Ghafoor said reading Mr Lohse's condensed description of hazing was 'gross,' but not a surprise. He thinks SAE is being scapegoated so the college can appear to be doing something to address hazing.

'But if the administration goes after it, it could make it even more underground, which would be more dangerous,' he said.
