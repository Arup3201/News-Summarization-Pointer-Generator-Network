A courageous mother who lost parts of both of her legs while protecting her children from a tornado exactly a year ago has shown off her astonishing recovery and her new state-of-the-art limbs.

Stephanie Decker, 38, lost one leg above 
the knee and the other foot protecting her 8-year-old son and 5-year-old
daughter as the storm flattened their 'dream home' in Henryville, 
Indiana on March 3.

But she has remained humble about her heroic act of love, and has become an advocate for other amputees since leaving rehab last summer.

And in an interview marking the one-year anniversary of the tornado, she revealed that the family is almost finished building their new home in Sellersburg.

Fighting back: Stephanie Decker has shown off her remarkable recovery a year after she lost her legs

New legs: Decker lost part of both legs while protecting her two children from a tornado last March

'We're currently building our house,' she told WHAS11. 'We thought about having a scripture 
signing of our home on the day and inviting the community to come and 
just say a few things on our walls.

'But we really just want to be there for everyone else... There are so many people who went through so many tragedies and ours is a good story.'

She also showed off her new legs, which have flexible prosthetic ankles and different settings for driving and walking. She charges the 
batteries in her two ankles and one knee every night.

'I get up in the morning and instead of 
putting on a pair of shoes, I put on a pair of legs,' Decker told the Courier Journal. 'And 
then my day begins. It’s fixing lunches, getting kids off to school.'

Brave: She has shown astonishing determination throughout the year, including as she walked through the White House last June, aided by President Obama, her husband and children

Upbeat: She also danced with Ellen DeGeneres on her show just two months after the accident

She also spends as much as two hours every day training at the gym.

The legs even helped her walk to the capitol in Kentucky last month, where she lobbied for a bill requiring private insurers to give amputees in the state greater access to advanced prosthetic, as Indiana does. The bill has now advanced out of a Kentucky House committee.

She also started the Stephanie Decker Foundation to help young amputees go to camp, pursue sports and other outdoor activities.

And last summer she was pictured walking into the Oval Office with the help of President Obama, just four months after her limbs were crushed by the debris.

'Dream home': The Deckers had spent nine months building their home in Henryville, Louisiana

Gone: The house 'took about nine months to build and about four seconds' to fall, Mrs Decker said

'So many good things have come from this accident,' Decker told the Courier Journal. 'I know that's kind of strange to say.'

And even when she wakes up knowing she has a struggle ahead of her, she stays positive.

'I have a lot to be thankful for,' she said. 'When I
get to wake up and see my kids every day it really squashes that, "Man,
this is hard" (mindset) really quick.”

Decker was injured when a series of mega tornadoes raged across 
Southern Indiana and Kentucky last March, killing 39, injuring 
many and destroying thousands of homes and schools.

She has previously spoken out about 
how uncertain she was about the impending disaster that she filmed a 
message on her mobile phone to her husband, telling him she loved him.

Happy family: Stephanie was surrounded by her family at the hospital, including her husband Joe (left), son Dominic (center right) and Reese (right)

A mother's love: As soon as the storm passed, Dominic, 8, ran to a neighbor's home for help

'I assumed I was safe and I heard the
roar like a train, and I heard it behind me, and I knew it was coming,'
she told ABC News. 'And it was so loud that I knew that I needed to do 
something different. I knew staying put wasn't going to work.'

'They were screaming, "Mommy, I can’t
live without you! I don’t wanna die, please don’t let me die!" and I 
said, "you’re not going to die, we’re going to make it".'

Then she realised she had been badly 
hurt, with her leg appearing as if it had been severed. She also 
suffered seven broken ribs and a punctured lung.

'I knew it was bad. If I didn't get help soon, I was going to bleed out,' she added to ABC News.

Support: Stephanie is pictured with her husband Joe, son Dominic and daughter Reese

Fears: Mrs Decker was so worried she was going to die as a result of her injuries that she filmed a video on her mobile phone for her husband Joe, pictured, to tell him she loved him

Knowing his mother was hurt, it was 
Dominic's turn for bravery. He crawled out from under his mother and ran
to a neighbor's house.

'After Dominic left, I realised I 
couldn't get out because I actually used the comforter I tied with them 
as a tourniquet. I knew I was cut,' she said.

One
neighbour, Brian Lovins, a Clark County Sheriff’s officer, used his 
belt to create a tighter tourniquet and drove her until he could flag 
down an ambulance, which took her to hospital.

Her husband, Joe Decker, tearfully said that the flattened house had been their dream home.

His
wife had said she always wanted to have the children's handprints 
imprinted in the foundation's cement, because 'we were never gonna leave
here'.

Destruction: The Decker family home was just one of the hundreds destroyed by tornadoes in Indiana. Damage can be seen in nearby Marysville which was entirely wiped off the map by the severe weather

The small prints, with the 'Reese' and 'D' for Dominic, remain scrawled in the concrete.

Mr Decker said: 'What I told her was: "You’re alive and you get to see your kids grow up".'

The
home, which was partly built by Mr Decker and his wife's father, was 
completely destroyed, with a bathtub 200 feet away in a nearby field.

Henryville was nearly entirely 
flattened by a series of tornadoes that ravaged the South and Midwest on
Friday March 3, killing 39 and leaving thousands homeless.

The Decker’s inspirational story is 
one of the few from that fateful day, which saw deaths in Alabama, 
Georgia. Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio, with Indiana and Kentucky 
particularly hard hit, with 13 and 21 lives lost respectively.
