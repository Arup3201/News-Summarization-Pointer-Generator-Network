A Peruvian footballer is reported to be recovering in hospital after being struck by lightning during a national cup semi-final.

Joao Contreras Fuentes, a player from the Sport Aguila club, was preparing for the start of the second half in a Copa Peru tie with Fuerza Minera when he was hit by a bolt and instantly collapsed.

The 21-year-old was surrounded by alarmed players and carried off the pitch and taken by ambulance to hospital.

An assistant referee, Abraham Loayza Morales, was also hurt in the incident at the Mariscal Castilla stadium in Lima.

Sport Aguila captain Amilcar Lobon told the newspaper Diario Correo his team-mate's condition was improving.

'Thank God he's okay, he's getting better, and now we're just thinking about his recovery,' Lobon said. 'It's difficult to imagine this situation that just doesn't happen in Huancayo.

'As I reiterate, the important thing is that our friend Joao is out of danger.'

The horrifying incident sparked media speculation in Peru that Contreras had died, leading to an angry reaction from the Peruvian Football Federation (FPF).

It said in a statement on its website: 'Unfortunately the force of nature has caused a serious impact to the health of one of the Sport Aguila players and one of the refereeing team.

'We regret that some media have released definitive news about the death of the Sport Aguila player, without having checked the news and in clear violation of the fundamental rules of prudence, since the player and the referee have family and therefore deserve respect.'
