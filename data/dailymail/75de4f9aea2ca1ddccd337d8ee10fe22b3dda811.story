Harrison Ford won't be getting back into his Han Solo costume anytime soon.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the 71-year-old actor will take as many as eight weeks off from filming Star Wars: Episode VII after he broke his ankle on set in London. Though he has a reported large role in the sci-fi film, shooting will continue in his absence.

The action star was airlifted to the trauma unit at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford  on Thursday after the door of the Millennium Falcon fell on him.

He's out... for a while: Harrison Ford, pictured in London on June 5, will be off the set of Star Wars: Episode VII for up to eight weeks to mend his broken foot, claimed The Hollywood Reporter on Monday

The Reporter's source added that Episode VII is still expected to make its December 18, 2015 release date.

Harrison was injured when the door of the Millennium Falcon, the spacecraft that his character flies in the original films, fell on him.

The movie began filming in May with shooting taking place in London and Abu Dhabi.

In March, Disney CEO Bob Iger said that Episode VII will be set 30 years after the events in 1983's Return of the Jedi.

Two months is a long time to miss out on the shoot that is scheduled to last only about three or four months.

But the injury seems to be bigger than previously thought.

It was reported by a source last week that Ford clutched his chest in pain as crew members rushed to free him from underneath the prop's hydraulic door after the accident at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire.

In a statement to Sky News, the spokesman said on Monday the Indiana Jones star was ‘hoping to announce some good news soon.’

A spokesman for John Radcliffe Hospital was unable to confirm whether the actor had been discharged from hospital today.

It is thought that as well as fracturing his ankle, he may also have suffered further injuries to his chest and pelvis – although he is said to be awaiting results of further tests to confirm the extent of any damage.

The latest news comes after his wife Calista Flockhart, best known for her starring role in sitcom Ally McBeal, confirmed she had flown from the US to be at her husband’s bedside.

Reprising his buccaneering role from the early films for Star Wars: Episode VII, it is believed Ford was about to start a scene involving the 111ft vehicle when the incident occurred.

'Harris was hit by the door and looked in a bad way and was clutching his chest when he was on the stretcher,' a source told The Mirror.

The insider added that he was in 'a lot of pain' and his foot appeared 'damaged.'

Star Wars: Episode VII, which is being directed by JJ Abrams, began filming in Abu Dhabi in mid-May.

The action is set 35 years after the last film they all appeared in together - 1983’s Return of the Jedi.

Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are also reprising their film roles. Newcomers include Adam Driver, John Boyega, Daisy Ridley and Oscar Isaac.

MailOnline has contacted Harrison Ford’s agent for comment.
