Talk about hitting pay dirt.

An Oklahoma teenager has sold a 3.85-carat diamond she unearthed at an Arkansas park, banking an impressive $20,000 for the gem.

Tana Clymer said she found the diamond last October while hunting for precious stones with her family at Crater of Diamonds State Park in Murfreesboro, Ark.

The park is the only diamond-producing site in the U.S. that is open to the public, with visitors allowed to keep whatever they find.

Precious: Tana said she considered keeping the diamond and turning it into a ring, however she is now going to use the $20,000 as money for college

'No two diamonds are alike, and each diamond finder's story is unique, too,' assistant park superintendent Bill Henderson said

Tanya told television station KWTV she believes it was the hand of God that pointed her to the yellow diamond, which is about the size of a jellybean.

'I thought it was a piece of paper or foil from a candy wrapper,' Tana said.

'Then, when I touched it, I thought it was a marble.

'I think God pointed me to it.

'I was about to sprint to join my family, and God told me to slow down and look.

'Then, I found the diamond!'

The canary is teardrop-shaped.

Tana named the it 'God's Jewel', park officials said.

Tana told KWTV that she plans to use the money to help pay for college.

Last month, a Louisiana man found a 2.89 carat white diamond at the park.

Brandon Kalenda of Maurepas found the gem on March 6 and said he plans to keep it.

Kalenda named the diamond 'Jax Diamond' after his infant son Jackson.

Tana's is the 396th diamond found so far this year in the park.

More 
than 75,000 diamonds have been unearthed at the site since 1906.

Other gems discovered at the state park include amethyst, garnet, peridot, jasper, agate, calcite, barite, and quartz.
