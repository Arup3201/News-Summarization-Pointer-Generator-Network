Prepare to see double Olympic cycling champion Victoria Pendleton in a different kind of saddle as she starts training to become a jump jockey. 

The 34-year-old, who is Britain's most successful female Olympian after winning sprint gold at Beijing in 2008 and the keirin at London 2012, hopes to compete in the Foxhunter Chase at next year's Cheltenham Festival. 

Pendleton has begun working with National Hunt trainer Paul Nicholls and Team GB's eventing performance manager, Yogi Breisner.

The change of career has been funded by online bookmakers Betfair, and the former cyclist hopes to obtain her Category A amateur license which would allow her to ride in amateur races on the Flat and over jumps, as well as compete in the point-to-point field.

She told the Daily Mirror: 'I've been looking for a new and exciting challenge, and when they approached me about the opportunity to become a licensed amateur jockey, it captured my imagination. I'm motivated by the scale of the challenge and the opportunity to combine my love of horses with learning a new skill under the guidance of racing experts put together for me.'

'I will be working closely with Yogi Breisner, Chris King and Paul Nicholls to help train and advise me over the next 12 months.

Pendleton has been praised by trainer Nicholls, who says she is an outstanding athlete with a real drive

'My team and I have identified the ambitious target of riding competitively in the Foxhunters Chase at Cheltenham Festival next year, but the initial focus will be on getting me to a level whereby I am granted an amateur jockey licence, which is a significant challenge in itself given that I had never even sat on a horse until a week ago.'

Nicholls added: 'Victoria Pendleton is an outstanding athlete with a real drive and determination, so whilst this is an incredibly difficult challenge, these attributes are exactly what you need to become a jockey.

'Having the competitive mind set of an Olympic champion, I've no doubt will put her in a great place to succeed in this challenge whilst also shining a much deserved light on the sport of horse racing.'

Breisner, who is the eventing performance manager for Team GB, will be acting as a mentor to Pendleton and believes her athletic mindset will be a huge plus.

He said: 'Victoria is a hugely talented, ambitious and gutsy individual, and these traits will stand her in the best stead possible for achieving this ambitious goal.

'Having worked with her for a week, the progress she has already made in such a small amount of time is quite frankly remarkable. It's a real privilege to work with Victoria on a challenge of this magnitude.

'While no one under estimates the scale of the challenge ahead, Victoria's undoubted mental and physical strength, coupled with the team Betfair have put together to help her with this challenge, means we are in a fantastic position for Victoria to achieve the ambitious goal of riding at Cheltenham Festival in 2016'.
