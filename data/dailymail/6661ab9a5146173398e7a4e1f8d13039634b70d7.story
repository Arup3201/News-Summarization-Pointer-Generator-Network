West Ham striker Andy Carroll admits he can't wait to return to action, and believes he can help the club push on for Europe.

Sam Allardyce's side are currently sitting in fourth in the Premier League after beating champions Manchester City 2-1 at Upton Park on Saturday.

Carroll missed that game, and has indeed been absent all season with an ankle injury, but says it is 'unbelievable' to be training again with a team that is playing 'fantastically'.

West Ham tweeted to reveal Carroll or 'The Big Man' as they refer to him is back in training 

''It's unbelievable. I've been out for so long that to be back training with the lads again is a fantastic feeling,' Carroll told West Ham's official website. 'It has been a difficult few months, being in a dark gym by myself training every day.

'We're playing fantastically. The gaffer has signed some great players and we're showing the quality we've got with the goals we're scoring. That's why we are where we are in the league, so for me to be a part of that - I cannot wait.

'I think we can push right on for Europe. I don't see why not - I think all the lads are positive about that and I know the gaffer is too.'

West Ham play Stoke in their next Premier League fixture at the Britannia Stadium.
