The average homeowner wastes three days a year manually adjusting the slats on their venetian blinds.

To solve this problem, a Bulgarian start up has invented Jalousier - a device that clips onto existing blinds and automatically adjusts slats according to changes in weather, temperature, light and even the time of day.

The firm claims it can not only save users time, it can also reduce heating and electricity costs by up to 18 per cent with an average saving of $350 (£210) per home.

The Jalousier device, pictured, clips onto existing venetian blinds and automatically adjusts the slats according to changes in weather, temperature, light and even the time of day. It is expected to go on sale in October and costs $129 (£77). The firm claims it can save the average home $350 (£210) per year in heating bills

Jalouiser is fitted with sensors that automatically monitor 
for changes in light, temperature, weather and time of day. As it gets 
dark, the blinds will open to let in more light.

If it starts raining, the slats are adjusted to an angle that lets in more light, but one that is also optimised to retain room temperature.

Users
 can additionally adjust the slats manually, via the app's interface, as
 well as control them using hand gestures made when holding the phone. For example, tilting the phone forwards can tilt the slats in the same direction.

This means blinds can be adjusted remotely while on holiday, for example, or before a user arrives home.

The device is expected to go on sale in October and will cost $129 (£77). 

Jalouiser is powered by six AA batteries and connects to smartphones, tablets and laptops via Wi-Fi using a dedicated Android and iOS app, or via the dashboard on a browser. 

It can be fitted to existing blinds 'in seconds' without any tools, and comes with a CordBox to keep the blinds' cord out of reach from pets and children.

Users can additionally adjust the slats manually, via the app's interface, meaning blinds can be adjusted remotely while on holiday, for example, or before a user arrives home. 

They can also be controlled using hand gestures made when holding the phone. For example, tilting the phone forwards can tilt the slats in the same direction.

Other settings include Do Not Disturb, that stops the blinds from turning to increase privacy, and Warmee, designed to maximise temperature.

The firm  has created an Indiegogo campaign to raise funds for its blind attachment. It is hoping to raise $140,000 (£84,000) before the campaign ends on 12 March

Its Alarm Clock feature can also be used to schedule the blinds to open in the morning and close at night.

'It offers endless possibilities of customisation, like syncing your blinds with an alarm clock, shared access with family, and getting a reminder to look outside to see a brilliant moon or even the first snowfall of the year,' said Sergey Vinogradov from Jalousier.
