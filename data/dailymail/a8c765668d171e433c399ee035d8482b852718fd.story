Mark Allen booked his place in the semi-finals of snooker’s Masters with a hard-fought win over Joe Perry at London’s Alexandra Palace.

Allen made only one break of more than 50 in a scrappy affair but played his better snooker as the game went on, winning the final two frames to claim a 6-4 success.

Perry was struggling for rhythm himself, but came from 3-1 down to tie it with breaks of 50 and 68.

But Perry made Allen work hard for his position in the semi-finals and the match was tied at 4-4

He then levelled it again with a break of 67 in the eighth frame, winning it 104-24, the only time either player reached three figures.

Allen, who has now made it through to his second Masters semi, will face either Stephen Maguire or Shaun Murphy today for a place in the final.

‘For long periods, it was embarrassing,’ Allen  told BBC Sport. ‘I just could not get anything going. I was delivering the cue so badly. That is sport for you and snooker in general. It can happen. I am happy I found something at 4-4 and to be in the semis. I have always had good bottle.’
