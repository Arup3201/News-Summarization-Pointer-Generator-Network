Fernando Alonso will fly to Malaysia for the Grand Prix on March 29 after having tests to establish whether he has recovered from concussion.

The McLaren driver missed the season's first race in Australia after a crash in pre-season testing.

His adviser Luis Garcia Abad refused to confirm reports in Spain that Alonso had got the all-clear after the tests.

'It is private so I cannot confirm or deny it, but I have no doubts he will go to Malaysia as planned,' he said.
