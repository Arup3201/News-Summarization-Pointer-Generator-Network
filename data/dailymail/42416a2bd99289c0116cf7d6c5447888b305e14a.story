According to the ABC, there were people standing outside the centre encouraging the behaviour and telling the protesters their actions would get them into Australia. 

The news site said they have videos from inside the detention centre showing what appeared to be two men being taken away on stretchers

Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said the asylum seekers should dismiss this advice as this will not get them in to Australia any faster.

'I'm very concerned that somehow people are conveying a message that through non-compliant behaviour, by refusing to take food or water that somehow that behaviour will change the outcome for those individual cases in terms of their desire to be settled in Australia,' he said.

'If people are acting on that advice they should dismiss that advice.'

Ian Rintoul said guards entered the Delta compound about 4pm on Friday, with some asylum seekers reporting they had been attacked.

The government has not commented on the claims.

Mr Dutton earlier said he was confident appropriate action was being taken to deal with the circumstances on Manus Island as they unfolded.

He said he was worried about developments over the last 24 hours.

Mr Dutton would not comment on individual cases, but said authorities were providing medical assistance and offers of support

'I'm concerned about what I've learnt in the last hour or so. And the situation is volatile, there's no question about that,' Mr Dutton told reporters on the Gold Coast on Friday.

It is the biggest protest at the centre since fatal riots in February last year.

Mr Dutton would not comment on individual cases, but said authorities were providing medical assistance and offers of support.

The protests began after the immigration department threatened to force 50 refugees to move to insecure accommodation at the Lorengau settlement on Manus, the RAC says

Mr Rintoul said PNG was not safe and its government had no political will to allow secure resettlement in PNG

Mr Rintoul said PNG was not safe and its government had no political will to allow secure resettlement in PNG.

'The government should call off the threat to forcibly move refugees on January 22,' he said.

Mr Dutton said he wanted to make it clear that, even though he had taken over from Scott Morrison, the Australian government's position on border protection had not changed

No one who arrived by boat without a visa would be settled in Australia, he said

'All the asylum seekers and refugees should be brought to Australia where their processing and resettlement can be guaranteed.'

Mr Dutton said he wanted to make it clear that, even though he had taken over from Scott Morrison, the Australian government's position on border protection had not changed.

No one who arrived by boat without a visa would be settled in Australia, he said.

There were previous reports of unrest on the island in December after reports emerged that detainees were in protest over their disgusting living conditions

Of the 1200 detainees on the island, only 13 of them had been processed and given visas in the 17 months they had been there, leading to massive protests and brawls on Manus Island

'That remains absolutely the case.'

Of the 1200 detainees on the island, only 13 of them had been processed and given visas in the  17 months they had been there, leading to massive protests and brawls on Manus Island.

It is believed that the 13 people who were granted a temporary visa are required to reapply annually and are expected to live off $46 a week, until they find a job.
