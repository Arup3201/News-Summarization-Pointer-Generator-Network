The evidence heard by the grand jury deliberating over the shooting death of Michael Brown could be kept secret, it has emerged, as the panel prepares to convene to discuss the case further.  

The jury, which is deciding whether to indict officer Darren Wilson for fatally shooting the unarmed black 18-year-old in Ferguson on August 9, is expected to deliver a verdict on Monday morning.

If they choose to indict Wilson, who is white, the testimonies, documents and photos presented to them will not be released to the public because they will be used during the subsequent trial.

However, several weeks ago, St Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch said that if there is no indictment, the judge has agreed that the evidence in the case will be made public.

But on Sunday night, a contradictory statement was released, saying St Louis County Circuit Judge Carolyn Whittington has entered no such order or made no such agreement.

In the statement, sent to KSDK-TV, the county's director of judicial administration, Paul Fox, said Judge Whittington must analyze the records before she can approve their release.

He added that this cannot be done until the grand jury of seven men and five women has heard all of the evidence in the case of Brown, whose Missouri death made headlines across the world.

The statement is in stark contrast to Mr McCulloch's earlier comments that 'If there is not an indictment returned... [the judge] has agreed, that the records will be made public.'

It comes as law enforcement has dispatched hundreds of police armed with grenades, enlisted 100 FBI officers and erected barricades around Buzz Wesfall Justice Center ahead of the verdict.

Brown's shooting in August sparked violent protests across Ferguson, Missouri and nationwide - and the conflicted suburb of St Louis is anticipating further outcry on Monday morning.

On Sunday, as protesters took to the streets of Ferguson, a woman accidentally shot herself in the head with a gun bought for protection from the demonstrations, according to reports.

The 26-year-old, named in a police report as Becca Campbell, was holding the gun in her boyfriend's car when he unintentionally rear-ended another vehicle, a police report said.

It caused the gun to go off, hitting Miss Campbell, who died hours later in hospital. 

Last night, a lawyer for Brown slammed the grand jury process as 'unfair', saying that because of the procedure, officer Wilson could completely avoid trial. 

'I have no doubt if they were to indict the police officer, he would be guaranteed his full constitutional rights of innocent until proven guilty,' attorney Benjamin Crump told ABC News

'He would get every benefit of the doubt. I don't worry about the due process for officer Wilson. I worry about the due process for the little black boy dead on the ground.

'The process is completely unfair.'

Following evidence from Wilson, forensic pathologists and witnesses, the panel will have to decide whether the officer intentionally violated Brown's civil rights by fatally shooting him. 

Last month, legal experts told MailOnline the charge is more complex and difficult to prove than a murder or manslaughter charge.

Peter Joy, a professor at the Washington University of Law in St Louis, said the charge of civil rights abuse is a much higher standard than murder or manslaughter, as the 12 jury members will have to be certain Wilson intended to violate Brown's civil rights by shooting him dead.

'The civil rights abuses are even harder to prove than an underlying criminal conviction. The federal government does not step in to pursue a civil rights conviction unless they believe it was an intentional abuse,' he said.

'Racism': Protesters accuse the county police of creating a racial divide in the majority black suburb 

Devastated: Daily tributes are paid to shrines for Michael Brown who allegedly had his hands up when he died

'There are some criminal charges that don't involve that kind of mental state, like murder.For example, anger. They can be guilty of acting knowingly and recklessly, but it is different to intentionally violating a civil right.'

As a result, he said, they will need forensic evidence of damage to the car to disprove Wilson's account if they are to find him guilty.

Brown's mother Lesley McSpadden has urged protesters to refrain from violence, while President Obama has called for calm.

Obama added that he has not ruled out a trip to Ferguson following the release of the jury's verdict.
