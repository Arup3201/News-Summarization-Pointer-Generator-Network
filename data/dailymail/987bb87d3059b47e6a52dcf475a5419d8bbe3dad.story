The Scouse Brow has been voted the worst female beauty sin, topping a list of crimes that includes foundation tidemarks, spidery eyelashes and caked-on powder.

The dark, angular, pencilled-in brow look has been showcased over the years by Liverpool celebrities Coleen Rooney and Alex Curran - but has recently fallen out of favour as girls go for a more natural power brow look like Cara Delevingne's.

The survey, which found that over-plucking the brows is almost as offensive as pencilling them in too strong, revealed also that women are harsher judges of each other's looks than they are of men's.

WAGS Coleen Rooney and Alex Curran have both fallen victim to the so-called Scouse Brow in the past - a strong, dark, angular pencilled-in brow

The study found that 78 per cent of 
women would negatively judge a woman with badly applied make-up, and a 
particularly disparaging 22 per cent would even refuse to socialise with
 women who happened to be poorly presented.

In what is no doubt a blow to
sisterhood, the new survey showed that the fairer sex are 
nearly five times more likely to judge a woman by her appearance than a 
man.

The survey of over
 1,000 women revealed that 78 per cent of women admitted they would look 
negatively upon a woman whose make-up was poorly applied.

Over
 half added that they would view a woman with badly applied make-up as 
grubby and lacking in essential presentation skills with one fifth of 
women adamant that a woman with bad make-up would not be welcome in 
their social circle.

The Scouse Brow came top in the list of deadly beauty sins with women saying it was the worst beauty blunder.

Other cosmetics crimes included foundation tidemarks on the face, patchy fake tan and concealer on the lips.

Overplucked eyebrows, too much mascara and clumped 'spidery' eyelashes also took a lashing as the worst face faux pas .

1. Scouse brow 21.2%

2. Foundation tidemarks 20.4%

3. Patchy fake tan 16.4%

4. Concealer lips 9.3%

5. Overplucked eyebrows 8.7%

6. Clumped 'spidery' eyelashes 6.7%

7. Caked-on powder on face 4.5%

Emma Leslie from Escentual.com who conducted the survey said: 'It's no secret that many women these days like to take an interest in other women's appearances - whether positively or negatively.

'Of course it's never nice when this leans towards the malicious side of the spectrum.'

'A lot of these beauty 'sins' can easily be avoided by paying a little more attention when getting ready, though.

'As for the Scouse Brow coming up trumps in the list of blunders - style icons like Kate Middleton and Cara Delevingne both have bold brows, which have become an intrinsic, much-coveted element of their looks.

'So it seems that beauty really is in the eye of the beholder.'
