A law student was targeted by hackers who stole her Facebook account and used it to advertise her services as an escort.

Jazmine Jones claims police have refused to take action over the 'e-whoring' scam - and says that the fraudsters have been threatening to steal her identity to set up fake bank accounts.

The scammers have also managed to cheat other web users by posing as the 23-year-old student and asking for money because she was in trouble.

Nightmare: Jazmine Jones, a law student from Kent, has had her identity stolen by online fraudsters

Miss Jones's fraud nightmare began last October, when she discovered that her email account had been hacked by identity thieves, who used it to access her Facebook page, stealing 300 photographs as well as personal information.

The hackers set up additional Facebook accounts using her pictures, and saying that she was an escort.

'When I realised this was happening I went to the police straight away,' she said. 'They told me there was nothing they could do - "Don't take it seriously, I'm sure it will be fine."

'I also told Facebook but each time they close an account a new one opens up. In June it got completely crazy. There were 10 fake Facebook accounts of me.

'It's basically identity theft - not only this, but these accounts have been messaging guys on Facebook asking them to borrow money and saying I'm an escort to get money.'

Distraught: Miss Jones says police told her that they were powerless to act against the scammers

Miss Jones, from Beckenham in Kent, said that one man, named James, lost Â£250 after he received a message apparently from her, saying she was stranded in her car and needed money immediately.

Recently, the situation turned even more sinister as the anonymous fraudster sent the students photos of her own driving licence, obtained from her hacked emails, and threatened to set up bank accounts in her name.

'It's complete cyber bullying and I'm starting to fear for my safety,' she said. 'I've contacted the police and they've told me that unless it is a terrorism threat there is nothing they can do about it.

'I feel let down and unsupported. It seems they won't do anything unless something really serious happens. I don't know who this person is and it's getting to the point that I feel I could get attacked or something.

Danger: The hackers used Facebook to advertise the student's services as an escort

A Facebook spokesman said: 'We take our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities very seriously and react quickly to remove reported content that violates our policies.

'The goal of these policies is to strike a very delicate balance between giving people the freedom to express themselves and maintaining a safe and trusted environment.

'We encourage people to report anything they feel violates our policies using the report links located throughout the site or by using the reporting tools in our Help Centre at facebook.com/report.'

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'If someone has created a fake social media account in your name, you should report this to the social media company provider concerned, who will then be able to take the appropriate steps to have the profile removed'.
