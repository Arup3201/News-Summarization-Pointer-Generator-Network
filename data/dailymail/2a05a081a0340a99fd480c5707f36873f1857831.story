After members of the North Miami Beach Police Department were caught using photos of black teenagers for target practice earlier this month, Lutheran pastors and others have used social media to fire back.

Clergy members were discussing the situation in North Miami Beach on the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America Facebook group and decided they 'ought it make it harder to pull the trigger.'

They created the 'North Miami Beach Police, use our pictures for your target practice' event and began inviting both clergy and non-clergy members to post pictures of themselves. People also began using the hashtag #UseMeInstead on Twitter.

Lutheran pastors were 'outraged' to hear what was happening in Miami so they created the 'North Miami Beach Police, use our pictures for your target practice' event on Facebook 

Powerful statement: The event was created after a discussion on the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America Facebook group page

The campaign has 'snowballed' and people of all different faiths have been uploading their photos on Twitter

'We acknowledge the need for a police force that is trained in the use of their firearms.' the group wrote on the event page. 

'We feel that, if pictures of human targets are used for target practice, great care should be taken in not allowing the selection of these targets to allow for the dehumanization of those most vulnerable to police violence.

'To the members of the North Miami Beach Police: If you must use pictures of real humans for your target practice, we request that you use ours.' 

The campaign began to spread and the pictures have been flooding in ever since. 

The photos have begun to stack up and members of the NMBPD will soon have copies of their own because the group plans on mailing them to the department. 

'We initially started thinking if a whole lot of us, in our clergy collar and worship attire, sent our photos to them, it would make a really powerful statement,' Rev. Kris Totzke told the Washington Post.. 

'Then, it really snowballed, and we got people all over the country and of all different faiths.'

North Miami Beach police officers used mugshots of black men and teenagers (above) for shooting practice

North Miami Beach Police Chief J. Scott Dennis defended the practice earlier this month.

'Our policies were not violated,' he said. 'There is no discipline forthcoming from the individuals who were involved with this.' 

He has since apologized for the department’s use of the mugshots and the practice has been banned.
