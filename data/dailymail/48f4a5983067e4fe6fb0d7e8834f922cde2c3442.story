The wife of a man who allegedly killed three Muslim students execution-style has insisted that it was not due to their religion - but his victims' families have called on the police to investigate it as a hate crime.

Karen Hicks struggled to contain her emotions as she spoke at a press conference a day after Craig Hicks, 46, allegedly shot dead the trio near the University of North Carolina campus in Chapel Hill.

After the deaths of Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, his wife Yusor Mohammad, 21, and her sister Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, it emerged that Hicks had shared numerous anti-religious posts online - but his wife insisted that he did not target the family because of their beliefs.

'I can say with my absolute belief that this incident had nothing to do with religion or these victims' faith,' his wife insisted on Wednesday afternoon. 'But in fact was related to long-standing parking disputes that my husband had with the neighbors.'

Defense: Karen Hicks, who is married to suspected killer Craig Hicks, insisted on Wednesday that he was not motivated by race or religion when he allegedly shot three Muslims on Tuesday afternoon

Sadness: The family of victim Deah Shaddy Barakat spoke at a press conference at Swift Creek Community Center on Wednesday afternoon to call for police to investigate the killings as a hate crime

She added that 'like everyone else, I was just completely shocked that this had happened', especially because her husband of seven years often 'championed' rights of others.

'He just believed... everyone is equal,' she said. 'It doesn't matter what you look like or who you are, that's one thing I do know about him.'

Mrs Hicks' attorney said that the case highlights the need for mental health support - but refused to say whether Craig Hicks had any mental illness.

But in their own press conference held later on Wednesday, the family of Barakat called on the police to investigate the death as a hate crime.

His sister Suzanna Barakat said she cried tears of joy at her brother's wedding - little more than a month ago - but today she is crying 'tears of unimaginable pain'.  

The three victims were gunned down at their quiet condominium complex in Chapel Hill around 5pm.

Hicks turned himself in to authorities and is being held without bond. On Wednesday morning, he kept his head down as he appeared in an orange jumpsuit at the Durham County Detention Center.

On Wednesday, Durham District Attorney Roger Echols said: 'All motives will be under investigation.'

There have been questions over whether his anti-religious stance - which he freely shared on social media - had been a factor in the murders. 

Before Mrs Hicks spoke, the father of the two female victims, Dr. Mohammad Abu-Salha, said he believed the trio were targeted because of their religion and culture.

'It was execution style, a bullet in every head,' Abu-Salha told the News Observer. 'This was not a dispute over a parking space, this was a hate crime.

'This man had picked on my daughter and her husband a couple of times before, and he talked with them with his gun in his belt. And they were uncomfortable with him, but they did not know he would go this far.' 

On Facebook, Hicks shared a number of anti-religion posts, describing himself as a supporter of 'Atheists for Equality'. A banner about 'anti-theism' is prominent on his page.

Hicks posted a photo from United Atheists of America on February 8, which has the title 'why radical Christians and radical Muslims are so opposed to each others' influence when they agree about so many ideological issues'. 

Together: Craig and Karen Hicks have been married for seven years and he is a graduate student, she said

Most of the pictures he has posted in recent months criticize a number of religions, including Christianity. Other recent pictures he has published include one of a loaded revolver. 

In one post allegedly written by Hicks and shared by CNN, he wrote: 'When it comes to insults, your religion started this, not me. If your religion kept its big mouth shut, so would I.'

Craig Hicks has been charged with murdering the three Muslim students after handing himself in

He was a full-time student due to graduate in May from paralegal program at Durham Tech, Karen Hicks added. Records show she works for UNC Hospital. 

Police were called to Summerwalk Circle after shots were heard at about 5.10pm on Tuesday. 

When they arrived they found three people dead. They had been shot in the head, CNN reported. 

According to their Facebook pages, Mr Barakat had married his wife just over a month ago and was a second year student at the dental school at the University of North Carolina.

The last picture on his Facebook page, posted on January 29, said he helped provide free dental supplies to 75 homeless people in downtown Durham.  

The couple had organised an online fundraiser to get dental care to refugees from Syria, raising around $15,000 - but after news of their deaths, the total reached more than $23,000  

Mr Barakat was due to travel to Turkey in the summer to treat children who have become refugees following the civil war. 

Last month, he tweeted: 'It's so freaking sad to hear people saying we should 'kill Jews' or 'Kill Palestinians'. As if that's going to solve anything SMH [shaking my head].'  

His sister-in-law Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha had been studying for a degree at North Carolina State University in Architecture and Environmental Design. 

After their deaths, Barakat's brother Farris paid tribute to the trio on Facebook as he struggled to comprehend the killings. 

The students were shot dead near the quiet area of Finley Forest complex, near Summerwalk Circle

People claiming to be relatives gathered at the scene on Tuesday evening asking who the victims were

Tribute: Flowers have been placed outside the apartment building where the  couple and sister were shot

'It doesn't make sense,' he wrote, 'and for that I rely on the Most Wise. It hurts and for that I know that God will not burden me more than I can handle.

'I know my brother, his wife, and his sister in law are together as ultimate winners. This life was only ever a test and they have passed with flying colors...

'I haven't even begun to fully comprehend what has happened. But I know for sure those three together have done so much we are all proud of. No reason to stop being proud now.' 

He added: 'We live as Muslims to die as Muslims. May Allah enter them to the highest of paradise.' 

Following news of the deaths a hashtag #MuslimLivesMatter started trending on Twitter.  

Burcu Bozcurt wrote: 'Hate will not prevail. Three beautiful souls taken, but examples of their love & impact on others abounds. #MuslimLivesMatter #chapelhill'  

And MohaNNad said: 'Remember them like this. Deah and Yusor had names, dreams and families. #MuslimLivesMatter.'  

The couple are only thought to have been married for just a month and were fundraising for Syrian refugees

Heartbreaking: Yusor shared this beautiful photo, left, showing her dancing with her father at their wedding, right. On Wednesday, he said that he believes the trio were shot due to their religion and culture

Well-known atheist Richard Dawkins also condemned the killings on Twitter. He said: 'How could any decent person NOT condemn the vile murder of three young US Muslims in Chapel Hill?'

People called for action to be taken with some speculating that the attack could have been religiously motivated. 

A Facebook tribute page has been set up for the victims, called 'Our Three Winners'. It says: 'Deah Barakat, Yusor Abu-Salha and Razan Abu-Salha have returned to their Lord. They have set an example in life and in death.'  

It noted that funeral arrangements will be announced after they receive news from the medical examiner, who will carry out an investigation and release the bodies. 

The shooting took place in the Finley Forest complex - a typically quiet area home to students.

Bethany Boring encountered police cars, crime scene tape and people upset in the street when she went to walk her dog. 

She told WRAL: 'It's a very quiet community. It's a lot of graduate and professional students. You know, professional's families.' 

Armed: Two weeks ago he shared this image of his 'loaded 38 revolver, its holster and five extra rounds'

People living near Summerwalk Circle said the area was usually very quiet with little or no crime reported  

Daniel Waggoner who lives in the area added: 'I'm up late. I come home late and it's always quiet when I get here,' he said. 'So I mean yeah, it's surprising.' 

A campus crime alert from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was sent to students. The complex is located near campus.

About two hours after the shooting a group of young people arrived at the scene and sat on the pavement, apparently waiting for news of the names of the people who had been killed. Police later turned away people in tears, claiming to be relatives. 

The Chapel Hill Police Department said in a statement there was 'reason to believe that there is no ongoing threat to the public'.

The school added in a statement: 'We are sensitive to the impact an incident of this nature has on campus and in the community.

'We understand you want to know the facts as quickly as possible. At the same time, we must respect the job our Chapel Hill police have as they investigate this crime.'
