A Maine babysitter is accused of fatally dropping a 5-month-old baby and then choking the infant's three-year-old brother after the toddler kicked him in the groin.

Samuel Moore, 25, of Bangor was indicted Wednesday by a grand jury and is facing one count of depraved indifference murder as well as the manslaughter for the March 3 incident, which caused the death of Korbyn Garfield Antworth two days later at Eastern Maine Medical Center.

Police say Moore had been babysitting the brothers for their parents, William and Brittany Antworth, and had been 'tossing (Korbyn) around' when the couple's 3-year-old son 'struck him in the groin' to get him to stop shaking the baby.

More told investigators that he then dropped the baby from approximately 6 feet and 'he was not caught and did strike the floor,' according to Bangor Detective Brent Beaulieu.

The 25-year-old then 'choked [the elder boy] out of anger,' an affidavit reveals.

Korbyn suffered 11 rib fractures and had bleeding in his brain. Both injuries are consistent with shaken baby syndrome.

The toddler's face was covered with petechiae, small red or purple spots that indicate a minor hemorrhage, police said.

Held: Moore is being held at the Penobscot County Jail on $100,000 bond for the alleged murder of little Korbyn, pictured

Of the elder boy's injuries, Moore told the Ms Ashworth the child had 'ended up choking himself with a makeshift cape that he had tied around his neck himself,' according to Bangor Daily News.

However the alleged assault was uncovered by detectives.

When questioned about the child's injuries, Moore first told police that he 'had performed a wrestling move' on the boy that caused him to lose consciousness, the affidavit said.

'Moore admitted that [the boy] was limp for 10 to 15 seconds and this had scared him.'

Moore was also indicted Wednesday on one count of aggravated assault for the allegedly choking.

Moore is being held at the Penobscot County Jail on $100,000 bond.

The baby's cause of death has not been released.
