The Liberal Democrats achieved the lowest share of the vote of any major party in a by-election since 1948.

Nick Clegg’s party lost its deposit for the seventh time since 2010 with Andrew Graham clocking up just 1.4 per cent of the ballots cast in Clacton. 

As well as being the Lib Dems’ worst performance this Parliament, it is the second worst for any major party since the Second World War.

In the Clacton by-election, Nick Clegg's party lost its deposit for the seventh time since 2010 - candidates lose their money if they get less than 5 per cent of the vote, a major humiliation for a governing party

Only the Liberal hopeful in the Glasgow Camlachie by-election of 1948 fared more poorly. He got 1.2 per cent of the vote.

Candidates lose their deposit if they score less than 5 per cent of the vote: a major humiliation for a party of government.

In Clacton, the Lib Dems slumped to fifth place, amassing just 483 votes and a 1.4 per cent share – down from 12.9 per cent at the 2010 election. 

On Thursday they came behind Ukip, the Tories, Labour and the Greens – although they did manage to beat the Monster Raving Loony Party.

In Heywood and Middleton, the Lib Dems narrowly managed to save their deposit – with their vote share at 5.1 per cent. At the last election, they got 22.7 per cent of the vote. They totalled 1,457 votes on Thursday.

Andrew Graham (far right) picked up just 1.4 per cent of the vote last night. Only the Liberal hopeful in the Glasgow Camlachie by-election of 1948 fared worse with just 1.2 per cent

Former Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik tweeted: ‘In Middleton & Heywood by-election, Lib Dems seemed to lose larger proportion of vote to Ukip than Tories did. Am I the only one to notice?’ 

He attacked Lib Dem ‘inertia, leaving a vacuum that Ukip are filling’.

Tom Mludzinski, head of political polling at ComRes, said: ‘The Lib Dems once performed incredibly strongly in by-elections. They were outsiders. 

'Now, however, they are a party of government and it is much more difficult for them. 

'They are haemorrhaging votes in seats that aren’t theirs. We have never had a government party perform so badly.’

The Lib Dems’ worst performance in terms of votes since the general election was in South Shields in May 2013, where they got 352 votes – seventh position – and a tiny 1.4 per cent share.
