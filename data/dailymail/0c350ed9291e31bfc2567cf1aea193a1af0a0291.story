It is no secret that supermodel Hannah Davis looks good in a swimsuit. But in a new photoshoot for GQ magazine, she proved that she needs little more than a white T-shirt to look sexy.

The 23-year-old girlfriend of New York Yankee Derek Jeter is seen posing in designs by Vince and Splendid Mills, accessorized only by athletic over-the-knee socks and underwear.

And though she rarely comments on her on-off relationship with Mr Jeter, she admitted that she is ‘very happy’ at the moment.

Pared down: Hannah Davis, a 23-year-old swimsuit model, poses in a sultry new shoot for GQ magazine

Indeed, the couple’s relationship 
appears to be going from strength to strength. Last week, it was 
reported that Mr Jeter met Miss Davis’s parents over dinner in New York 
City.

The model has posed twice for Sports Illustrated’s swimsuit issue, as well as Victoria’s Secret and Ralph Lauren.

The
 U.S. Virgin Islands native did say of her scorecard with relationships:
 ‘[I’m] strangely intuitive, so I kind of know if I like you right off 
the bat.’

She grew up on the
 small, tropical island of St Thomas where she spent her teenage years 
as a champion tennis and volleyball player, even briefly joining the 
Virgin Islands National Volleyball team.

According
 to Miss Davis, the Virgin Islands are a great place to grow up, but it 
does have one drawback – the territory’s ID cards are apparently not 
welcomed by NYC nightclub bouncers.

Because of this, Miss Davis says that she is not prone to go out. ‘I’m like an old lady,’ she told GQ of her nightlife.

Miss Davis was scouted as a model at the age of 14 by a family friend.

She
 began dating Mr Jeter in late 2012, and in February 2014 it was 
reported that the two had broken up, only to apparently reconcile a 
month later.
