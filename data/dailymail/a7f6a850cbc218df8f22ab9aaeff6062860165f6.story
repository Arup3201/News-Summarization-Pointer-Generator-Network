Kay-Ann Morris, 23, has been charged on suspicion of murder after a 
seven-year-old girl's body was found at a home in Bestwood Park, Nottingham

A woman has been charged with murdering a seven-year-old girl who died from a head injury.

Nottinghamshire Police said Kay-Ann Morris, 23, would appear before magistrates tomorrow accused of killing the girl.

The girl's body was found at a house in Bestwood Park, Nottingham, at around 5am on Thursday after concerns were raised for her welfare. She is yet to be identified.

A police spokesman said Morris, from 
Bestwood Park, Nottingham, would remain in police custody until her 
appearance at Nottingham Magistrates' Court.

A post-mortem examination established the preliminary cause of the girl's death as a head injury, the spokesman added.

Officers investigating the death also arrested a 47-year-old man, who has now been released without charge.

Tributes have been paid to the 'stunning little girl' since she died. One neighbour said: 'She was a beautiful little girl, just a stunning little girl, it is so sad that she has gone.'

Anyone with information which could help 
the inquiry is urged to contact the incident room on 0115 8445012 or to 
call the Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.Â
