Anthony Weiner used campaign funds to hire private investigators in an attempt to prove he hadn’t tweeted a picture of his crotch, it has emerged.

The disgraced ex-politician paid T&M Protective Services of Manhattan, New York, $13,290 to allegedly prove his Twitter account was hacked.

But the probers reportedly realised they were on a wild goose chase and the politician of Queens, New York, later admitted he sent the photo.

Disgraced: Ex-politician Anthony Weiner, 47, paid T&M Protective Services to allegedly prove his Twitter account was hacked - even though it wasn't

Sources told the New York Daily News that the money was paid to T&M while Mr Weiner was trying to protect his reputation over the scandal.

Federal Election Commission financial statements showed that campaign money funded 'legal services', reported the New York Daily News.

'We’ve asked a firm to look into whether some of my photos could have been taken (and) manipulated,' Mr Weiner said at the time of the scandal.

This comes as it was revealed Democrats will hold a congressional seat left vacant when David Wu, another politician in a sex scandal, resigned.

Democrats poured $1million into the district, determined not to drop another safe seat after losing the district left vacant by Mr Weiner.

Political scandal: After days of denials, Weiner confessed in June that he tweeted a photo of his bulging underpants to a young woman

In December he was revealed to have been open to a threesome with e-mistress Traci Nobles and another man, reported Radar Online.

Online messages showed Mr Weiner asking: 'How about with another guy?' Ms Nobles replied: 'Hmmmm, haven't done it before'.

Mr Weiner went on to say that ‘it can be hot’, and when asked if he’s turned on by other guys, said: 'It depends on the guy, but generally yes'.

Ms Nobles, 35, a former cheerleading coach from Georgia, was one of at least six women who came forward with explicit online chats with him.

Interests: Meagan Broussard, left, and Ginger Lee, right, were two of the women involved in the political scandal which sent a shockwave through Washington

Her writings allege Mr Weiner, 47, sent explicit messages from his congressional office and boasted about masturbating in the House toilets.

The revelations were a huge political scandal in 2011, rocked Washington and contributed to Mr Weiner’s resignation from Congress on June 21.

Since stepping down, Mr Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin, an aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have mostly stayed out of the public eye.

Pregnant at the time of the scandal, Mrs Abedin gave birth to a baby boy named Jordan Zane Weiner on December 21.
