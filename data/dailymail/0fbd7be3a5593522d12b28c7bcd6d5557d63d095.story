Running low on fuel and making a desperate search for the nearest station could soon be a thing of the past.

Ford has unveiled its latest app that not only shows how far you can travel on the power you have remaining, it bases its predictions on your unique driving style.

The MyFord Mobile also lets drivers remotely access their vehicles meaning they can set the cabin temperature on a cold morning before they leave their house.

The app was announced at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and currently works with a selection of Ford’s electric and hybrid cars.

It specifically suits electric cars because the app can directly link to the battery to see a status level and accurate mileage.

But Ford spokesman Abraham Phillip told MailOnline the team is working on developing the software for petrol and diesel range. 

However, he couldn’t give a timeframe for this because it depends on the technology being integrated, and legislation in individual markets.

For example, due to emission restrictions in the EU users can’t use the MyFord Mobile app to remotely start their car, but they can in the US.

Similar restrictions may apply for the fuel management feature.

To check their driving range, drivers open the app and add their location and destination.

The app uses a traffic light system to show if the journey is possible, or at least how far the driver can travel before needing to charge their car using a map. This map also shows the nearest charging stations, including their price.

The first vehicles to offer MyFord Mobile in Europe will be the Focus Electric, available in spring 2015.

Now available in Europe, the Focus Electric is powered by an electric motor and lithium-ion battery powertrain that achieves a top speed of 85mph (137 km/h).

The 6.6 kW onboard charger has a driving range of 62 miles (100km) with two to three hours charging, and around 93 miles (150 km) driving range with three to four hours charging from a 32 A charging station.*

It additionally has Sync 2 voice control with touchscreen to let drivers programme charging times, and set a chosen cabin temperature for when they start the journey, from within the car.

MyFord Mobile is also available for the C-MAX Energi plug-in electric hybrid vehicle.

To learn a driver’s habits the app determines how far they have travelled within a certain time to gauge speed but also how often they braked, based on distances travelled, and when they accelerated significantly.

The driver is then rated on a scale from ‘Zippy’ to ‘Zen’. To be more fuel efficient, the driver needs to be at the latter end of the scale.

But if they’re not, the app offers tips such as releasing the accelerator or braking less heavily.

The Trends screen additionally shows miles, or kilometres driven, and how much CO2 has been saved.

Taking inspiration from gaming and personal fitness apps, MyFord Mobile shows CO2 savings as exercise balls, or hot-air balloons to reflect how much could be used to fill each.

In terms of the ‘remote preparation’ features, the driver can set the cabin to warm up or cool down at a set time each day, or set the precise temperature.

As well as informing drivers when they have made CO2 savings, alerts also let drivers know when they have reached certain zero-emission distance benchmarks, such as covering a distance equivalent to one round-the-world trip.

This is shown as an Achievement figure.

And if the driver can’t remember where they parked the car, the app will pinpoint its location on a map.

The first vehicles to offer MyFord Mobile in Europe will be the Focus Electric, which also has Sync 2 voice-activated controls, available in spring 2015.

MyFord Mobile is also available for the C-Max Energi plug-in electric hybrid vehicle.

More vehicles will be announced later this year.

MyFord Mobile is a free app on iOS and Android for the compatible Ford car owners.

It connects to the car via an on-board modem and this sends data directly to a remote server and is available in English, Dutch, French, German and Spanish, MyFord Mobile is free for the first five years of vehicle ownership. 

‘MyFord Mobile makes owning an electric vehicle even more convenient. It displays CO2 savings in terms of objects everyone is familiar with, and shows how further energy efficiencies can be achieved in a way that is easily understood,’ said Don Butler, executive director, Connected Vehicle and Services, Ford Motor Company.

‘Electric car drivers want to understand the environmental benefits their vehicle brings, and also to know how they could improve their contribution to help make a better future. MyFord Mobile helps them to do this.’
