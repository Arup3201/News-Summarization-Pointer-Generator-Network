Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have reached the point of no return.

The two Australians are making their final journeys from the Bali prison where they have been incarcerated for 10 years to a sinister island they have only heard about called Nusakambangan. There, a firing squad awaits.

The grim news that there is now no hope of escaping their fates hangs heavily over the family and friends of the two men.

For Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 34, leaving the Balinese prison which has been their home for the last 10 years brings only fear and dread.

Prison home: Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have been escorted out of Kerobokan prison in Bali, their home for 10 years, and have begun their finals journey, to Nusakambangan, aka Death Island

Growing up inside: Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, aged about 22 and 25 years old in 2006 (left), and the men almost a decade later (right) pictured inside Kerobokan jail this week as they awaited the news about their departure from Bali for central Java where they will be executed

The ringleaders of the Bali Nine heroin drug ring were given a Hindu blessing ceremony at Kerobokan prison and said their farewells.

Neither man has been outside the walls of Kerobokan since shortly after their arrest on April 17, 2005, when Chan, then a 21-year-old, was seated on a Qantas flight which was ready to depart Ngurah Rai airport. He was not carrying any drugs.

Sukumaran only enjoyed a few more hours of freedom, his arrest coming later on the same day at the Melasti Beach Bungalows in Kuta Beach along with Bali Nine mules Si Yi Chen, Tan Duc Than Nguyen and Matthew Norman, who had 11.8 ounces of heroin strapped to their bodies. A set of scales were also in the room.

One way trip: The two condemned men will fly to Tunggul Wulung airport in the central Javanese town of Cilacap 700km from  Denpasar airport which they have not seen for the ten years since the Bali Nine were arrested with 8.3kg of heroin in a doomed attempt to smuggle the drugs from Indonesia back to Australia

All men plus the remaining mules apprehended at the airport with heroin strapped to their bodies were interrogated and taken into custody at the Bali police headquarters before being transferred to Kerobokan.

Chan and Sukumaran left the prison never to return, escorted by 22 heavily armed men dressed in black, the members of the Brimob  special police mobile brigade.

Handcuffed and walked by figures with their faces hidden by masks and balaclavas, the pair were placed into armoured personnel carriers, called Barracuda or Wolf, and driven on the 30 minute trip to Ngurah Rai airport.

Unlikely to have got the chance to see the makeover the airport terminal has undergone since they flew into Bali in 2005, the men were driven across the tarmac to a small prop plane. They are being escorted every step of the way by the Brimob officers.

After takeoff Chan and Sukumaran got their last glimpse of Denpasar and Kerobokan prison before the aircraft turned west on its 700km journey.

The flight, expected to take two hours, took them over the mountainous terrain of eastern Java, with its volcanoes and verdant highlands, then down to the coast and tiny rundown Tunggul Wulung Airport in Cilacap, which normally opens only between 7am and 2pm and services mostly flight schools.

Muslim territory: This is the port of the coastal town of Cilacap in central Java which, in contrast to the Hindu culture of Bali, is Muslim and broadcasts on loudspeakers the five daily calls to prayer

Prison officers share a joke outside a shop at Wijaya Pura port in Cilacap as preparations took place for the executions of Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran at nearby Nuskambangan island

From the air strip to Wijaya Pura, the quay to Cilacap's port, it is a 16km drive through a sprawling industrial city, but the Indonesian police are expected to transfer the Australians to Nusakambangan in another armoured vehicle.

Although the Australians will miss the bustle of Cilacap's streets, which are choked with trucks and hundreds of noisy motorbikes, their transfer into a different culture will become obvious when they hear their first Islamic call to prayer broadcast on loudspeakers.

Death island: Nusakambangan island, as seen on this map, lies off the southern coast of central Java, and has been a prison island since the early 1900s with several abandoned facilities among its rubber plantations and rain forest and seven operational jails including Batu, to where Chan and Sukumaran are being transferred

Densely overgrown with tropical rainforest, Nusakambangan is 121 square kilometres and its seven operating prisons cannot be seen from the shore opposite.

They will then be taken to Batu or 'stone' prison, one of the island's seven facilities, where prison officers have been preparing special isolation cells to separate Chan and Sukumaran and others due for execution from the remainder of the prison population. 

Family members will have to take the police boat to Nusakambangan to visit them. The journey takes around 30 minutes and ends at Sodong dock.

This recreation of the firing squad aired on Indonesian television in January just before the execution on Nusklambangan of foreign drug traffickers. 'Eksekusi mati' means death by execution in the Bahasa Indonesian language

This eerie hooded figure, featuring in a TV recreation,  is meant to represent the condemned prisoner who has the choice of wearing a blindfold while being executed by firing squad in Indonesia

They will then be allowed visits from their families and  a minister of religion of their choosing as they are given 72 hours to live before they face the firing squad.

They will also be asked to make a written final request, which may be in the form of making a statement about their guilt or innocence.

They will also be allowed to choose whether they are strapped to the execution post when they face the firing squad and whether they wish to be blindfolded or not. 

Over on the mainland in Cilacap, Chan and Sukumaran's relatives will be staying in hotels and accompanied throughout the town by Australian embassy staff from Jakarta or Denpasar. 

Ambulances take the bodies of executed prisoners from 'death island' to the mainland

An ambulance with the body of  executed prisoner, Dutchman Ang Kiem Soei, at Cilacap in January arrives off the police boat from Nusakambangan island in central Java to thedock of Wjaya Pura port

Meanwhile, preparations for the executions are gathering apace, with ambulances due at the Java Christian Church on Friday, where they will be marked in alphabetical order, A to J, for the ten prisoners due for execution and labelled with the condemned person's names.

The ambulances will be loaded each with a coffin and taken to the island. At 10pm on Saturday, Cilacap mortician Suhendro Putra will board the police boat with the coffins and be ferried to Nusakambangan.

The families of Chan and Sukumaran may also go to the island if they wish, but Mr Putra told Daily Mail Australia that they would probably remain at Sodong dock while the executions took place.

Around midnight Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will each be taken to a clearing on the island to face a firing squad of twelve men armed with rifles, nine of which are loaded with blanks and three with live rounds.
