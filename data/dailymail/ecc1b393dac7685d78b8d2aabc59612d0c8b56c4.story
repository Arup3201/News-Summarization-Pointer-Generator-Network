Under fire Ed Balls put personal criticism to one side last night – by dancing Gangnam Style with other Labour big wigs at the party’s annual celebration of multiculturalism.

The shadow chancellor, who was booed by activists earlier yesterday after unveiling real-terms cuts to child benefit, joined his wife Yvette Cooper and host Keith Vaz at the party’s infamous ‘diversity night’ in Manchester.

Mr Vaz maintained tradition by putting in a showman’s performance, donning sunglasses and sharing the stage with belly dancers during the dance marathon.

Mr Balls, fresh from provoking anger among Labour activists after announcing real-terms cuts to child benefit, was cheered as he danced into the night

He also risked controversy by joking that many of the migrants trapped in Calais may be able to join the party next year.

He said: ‘We’ve got a raffle tonight. The first prize is a return ticket to Paris by Eurostar.

‘You could stop at Calais on the way and have a look at all those lovely people who will be at diversity night next year.’

Mr Vaz appeared delighted when two scantily-clad performers tied bright sashes to him and gyrated either side of him.

Ten shadow cabinet members joined the party, including Chuka Umunna, Harriet Harman and Sadiq Khan.

They performed the cult Gangnam dance – made famous by the South Korean pop star Psy – as confetti fell from the ceiling.

Coronation Street actors Shobna Gulati and Jimmi Harkishin - better known as characters Sunita and Dev – attended and were awarded the Diversity Award 2014, presented by Mr Vaz.

Speaking after the event Ms Cooper hailed the annual celebration of multiculturalism.

She said: ‘You just could not miss diversity night. It is the best party in the entire conference.’

Mr Vaz’s party conference was further boosted yesterday after it emerged that one his ancestors is in line to become a saint.

The Blessed Joseph Vaz, a 17th-century missionary known as the Apostle of Ceylon, is likely to be canonised in January, when Pope Francis visits Sri Lanka.

Home Affairs Committee member Paul Flynn said canonisation was a ‘family trait’ which may spur on the Leicester MP to aim for greater things.

He said: ‘This news will bring deep satisfaction to the members of the committee. It has certainly made my day.

‘I know that Keith has a picture of the Pope in his office. What we don’t know if whether the Pope has a picture of Keith on his wall.

‘We can but hope that the announcement today is a harbinger of great things to come for Keith.

'There’s only a few accolades left for him to win.’

Mr Flynn, a veteran Labour backbench MP, suggested the news may help attract an even greater class of witness to Mr Vaz’s committee.

Celebrities including Russell Brand, Shilpa Shetty and Mitch Winehouse have already been called to give evidence to MPs.

But Mr Flynn said: ‘He already has an impressive list of contacts, but this can only help.’

Mr Vaz said he was delighted with the news, but revealed he was unlikely to be allowed to visit Sri Lanka because of his outspoken criticism of the country’s treatment of the Tamil minority.

He said: ‘People are always proud to say they are related to royalty, but few MPs can boast of a saint in the family.’

A senior Labour source said: ‘Is there no end to the Vaz family’s talents?’
