More than 200 acres of the wild and 'magical' heathland that inspired author Thomas Hardy have been bought for the nation by the National Trust.

The £650,000 acquisition of Slepe Heath, Dorset, will connect existing protected heathland areas as part of efforts to conserve the landscapes of Hardy's novels.

Slepe Heath, whose windswept landscape was immortalised as fictional Egdon Heath in Hardy's Return Of The Native, is an important site for wildlife, including rare birds such as Dartford warblers, nightjars and woodlarks, the National Trust said.

Visitors to the 240-acre site, which rises 100ft above its low-lying surroundings, are given panoramic views of the area including Corfe Castle (above), Poole Harbour and the Purbeck Hills

The acquisition of the former forestry plantation will connect the protected lowland heath of Hartland Moor, which is already looked after by the National Trust and Natural England, and the Arne reserve owned by the RSPB.

Laurie Clark, National Trust Purbeck general manager, said: 'Slepe Heath is somewhere you can get that little bit closer to a true wildness.

'It's a magical and wonderfully atmospheric place where visitors can experience Hardy's fictional Egdon Heath, the setting for the Return of the Native.

'Dorset's heathland is among its crown jewels in terms of both wildlife and landscape.

'By looking after Slepe Heath we can ensure that this heathland remains open and protected for everyone to continue to enjoy.'

The National Trust said Hartland Moor and the Arne reserve were grazed by cattle in a way that conserved the landscape for wildlife, and the purchase of Slepe Heath would unite the sites into a single grazing area.

The move forms part of efforts to improve habitat for wildlife on a 'landscape scale' under the Wild Purbeck Nature Improvement Area scheme, one of 12 such large-scale areas designated across the country by the Government.

The acquisition was made possible by a legacy left to the National Trust, and is the largest area of lowland heath the Trust has acquired for more than a decade.
