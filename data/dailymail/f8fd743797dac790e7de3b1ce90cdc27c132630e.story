Graham Kavanagh is set to take charge of the Football League’s bottom club Hartlepool United on a short-term deal.

The former Republic of Ireland midfielder was sacked by Carlisle United last month with the Cumbrians at the foot of League Two.

But – under new manager Keith Curle – they moved off the bottom with a 3-0 win at Hartlepool on Saturday.

Colin Cooper quit after the final whistle when his Hartlepool side lost 3-0 to Carlisle on Saturday

Pools boss Colin Cooper quit after the full-time whistle and the Victoria Park club will now turn to Kavanagh to assist caretaker Sam Collins, the veteran defender who has doubled as reserve-team coach this season.

Chairman Ken Hodcroft will conduct the club’s search for Cooper’s replacement over the next month, with Kavanagh and former Scunthorpe United boss Brian Laws the early frontrunners for the post.
