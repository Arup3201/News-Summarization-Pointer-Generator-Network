'Keeps me off the streets': Sara Dappen, from 
Story City, Iowa, could be the world's oldest McDonald's worker, employed at her local branch at the age of 92

A nonagenarian Iowa woman could be the world's oldest McDonald's worker, still loving it at the grand old age of 92.

Sara Dappen was born in 1920, was part of the 1938 graduating class at Story City High and the 1942 class at Iowa state University.

These days though you'll find her flipping burgers at McDonald's Story City branch, where she has worked for the past five years.

'I thought it was more interesting to
keep walking around here than to be walking up and down the street, and
this keeps me from sitting,' she told KCCI 8 News.

Ms
Dappen is four years older than Britain's oldest McDonald's worker, 
88-year-old Bill Dudley, who greets customers and wipes tables at the 
fast food outlet in Mold, Clwyd.

She
too cleans tables and tidies up after customers, but she said her 
favourite thing to do was to chat with the people who come in the shop.

Both
Ms Dappen and Mr Dudley must find their shifts at the fast food giant 
helpful to supplement their pensions, but it'll never be more than a 
supplement.

The chain, 
already notorious for its low pay, become the object of ridicule this 
week when its financial advice website for employees recommended they 
take second jobs to make ends meet.

A sample budget given on the site sets aside only $20 for health care and $150 for car payments.

The financial planning tool, however, does not include allowances for either food or gas. 

The sample financial plan also makes no mention of basic necessities like child care expenses, water or clothing, to name a few.

A disclaimer on the Practical Money Skills site states that McDonald's does not endorse the site, even though the page features the fast food chain’s trademark Golden Arches.

Nevertheless, a company spokesman tried to defend its contents.

‘The samples that are on this site are generic examples and are intended to help provide a general outline of what an individual budget may look like,’ McDonald's said in a statement to the LA Times.

Opportunities: McDonald's is well known for 
employing people who have difficulty finding jobs elsewhere; but the company 
is notorious for the low salaries paid to workers. (Stock image, this is not the Story City
