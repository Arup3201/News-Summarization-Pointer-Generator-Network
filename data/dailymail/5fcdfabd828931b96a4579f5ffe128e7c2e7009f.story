Christopher Pyne has denied 'harassing' senators in order to get them to support his higher education reforms, insisting that he holds an 'excellent relationship' with the Senate's crossbenchers.

Palmer United Party Senator Glenn Lazarus accused the Education Minister of pestering him and others in a statement on Tuesday, saying he'd been 'inundated with text messages from Christopher Pyne' despite having never given him his mobile number.

But Mr Pyne dismissed the accusations, suggesting that the 'seven or eight' messages he'd sent Senator Lazarus were entirely acceptable and telling ABC's 7.30 Report that he would be 'happy to send him more'.

Education Minister Christopher Pyne has denied that he was 'harassing' Palmer United Party Senator Glenn Lazarus in order to gain his support for his higher education reforms package

'Senator Lazarus is the only crossbench senator who has refused to meet with me to discuss these reforms, so the only avenue he's left to me to be able to communicate with him, besides letters, is SMS,' Mr Pyne told ABC reporter Leigh Sales.

He then added: 'I hope you didn't mind the fact that I sent him a Christmas card today, Leigh, I'm sure he won't.'

'I would have sent him seven or eight texts and I'm happy to send him more texts.'

Mr Pyne claimed that Mr Lazarus told a reporter he was happy for the Education Minister to send him 'as many texts as he wanted' after the post had been published, saying: 'I'm as confused as the next person about Senator Lazarus wanting me to send him texts or not'.

'I would have sent him seven or eight texts and I'm happy to send him more texts,' Mr Pyne told ABC's 7:30

ABC journalist Leigh Sales, pointed Mr Pyne's ironic slip when pronouncing the name of cross bencher Zhenya 'Dio' Wang who he insisted he had an 'excellent relationship' with. He later scolded her, instructing her to study a bachelor of political science after being asked about the frequency of which he met with the crossbenchers

The Minister also made an ironic slip when pronouncing the name of cross bencher Zhenya 'Dio' Wang while insisting he had an 'excellent relationship' with him - a mistake that was quickly pointed out by Ms Sales.

'Well some people pronounce it Wang, some people pronounce it Wong; it depends where you are on the spectrum. But if you wish to pick me up on that Leigh, that's a very small thing and I'm surprised you'd bother with it. Never the less, Dio and I are good friends and I will continue to try and get their support,' he replied to the quip.

Clearly put-off by the slip, Mr Pyne then scolded Ms Sales, instructing her to study a bachelor of political science after being asked about the frequency of which he met with the crossbenchers and the quality of the relationships they shared.

'I have met with some of the crossbenchers many, many times – in fact I've met with some of them six or seven or eight times, but I'm not going to go through the day-to-day machinations of how government works, Leigh,' he said.

War of words. 'Christopher Pyne is embarrassing himself and needs to stop harassing me,' said Senator Glenn Lazarus of the Palmer United Party

'You can go and study that at university if you wish to, in a bachelor of political science. The reality is that I'm working closely with the cross bench, I secured four of their votes today and I'll be back at it again tomorrow with a new reform bill.' 

The higher education reforms, which include a reduction in government funding and permit universities to set their own fees, were rejected by the Senate on Tuesday night with a vote of 33-31. 

Senators Lazarus and Wang were amongst those who voted against the bill, alongside independents Nick Xenophon and Jacqui Lambie and the Labor and the Greens parties.

'I have never given Christopher Pyne my mobile phone number,' said Senator Lazarus before the reforms were rejected by the Senate on Tuesday night

Mr Lazarus, who is the Leader of the Senate for PUP, claimed Mr Pyne had been virtually begging him to support the higher education reforms and urged him to stop his 'desperation'.

'Christopher Pyne is embarrassing himself and needs to stop harassing me and other cross benchers,' said Senator Glenn Lazarus.

'I am being inundated with text messages from Christopher Pyne virtually begging me to support the Abbott Government's higher education reforms.

'I have never given Christopher Pyne my mobile phone number.'

The Senator claimed that Christopher Pyne's office and other Abbott Government ministers have been in constant contact with his office and those of other cross-benchers 'offering all sorts of deals and incentives to get our support for the higher education reforms'.

Education Minister Christopher Pyne insists that 'let's be clear: there is no viable alternative to these reforms'

But Senator Lazarus insisted that, 'I won't be bought and I am not prepared to horse trade'.

'It is clear that the Abbott Government is so desperate they will stoop to any level to win support.

'The majority of Australians do not want increased education costs.

'The higher education reforms are nothing more than a sinister Abbott Government budget cutting measure.

'The Abbott Government's higher education reforms are bad to the core and will only significantly reduce funding to universities which in turn will significantly increase the cost of higher education in Australia.'

Senator Lazarus went on to doubt whether Christopher Pyne will retain the education portfolio in the next year and insisted that 'Palmer United will be voting down the higher education reforms'.

With Labor and the Greens opposing the changes, the government would need support from 6 of the 8 cross-bench senators.

Mr Pyne stated that: 'In the final week of Parliament for 2014 the Government is urging the Senate to pass the vital higher education reforms to secure the future of our universities and spread opportunity to more Australians.'

'Without these changes our universities will be condemned to a slow decline – losing their competitive edge in our region and internationally.

'Let's be clear: there is no viable alternative to these reforms.'
