Ben Fogle said his wife Marina Hunt had to stop him from jumping out of the window after his drink was apparently spiked with LSD

Ben Fogle was taken to hospital suffering ‘a full on psychotic episode’ after his drink was apparently spiked with the drug LSD.

Speaking last night, the TV star revealed his terrified wife and friends locked him in a room for his safety after he tried to jump out of a window until an ambulance came to take him.

Fogle, wife Marina and their children were staying at a family friend’s house in Gloucestershire last Friday when he ‘flipped’ after returning from a country pub.

He said: ‘I don’t like using the word, but I was acting like a stereotypical madman. I thought I was doomed, I thought I was going to die.

‘My wife and friends kept trying to calm me down as I was threatening to hurt myself. I was 100 per cent out of my normal character.’

He said he ‘all was fine’ when they returned to the house about midnight and estimated he had drunk no more than half a bottle of wine.

But after going to settle son Ludo, three, back down, he realised something ‘very strange’ was happening to him as he attended to Iona, one.

He said: ‘I started feeling hypersensitive and I knew something was wrong. I picked my daughter up and she felt incredibly light, like a grain of rice.

‘I suddenly had this compulsion to jump through a window. I went back into the bedroom and asked my wife, “Are you feeling OK”. she said “yeah, are you?” and I said, “Look at me”.

‘I was staring at her and then I just flipped and had a full on psychotic episode. I was ranting, marching up and down, hitting walls, trying to jump out of windows. My wife ran out and had to get my friends who had to restrain me.’ They managed to ‘corral’ him into the living room until a paramedic arrived.

‘It was like having an out of body experience,’ said Fogle, 39, who explained that he has never voluntarily taken recreational drugs.

‘It was really upsetting because my wife had to see all of this.

‘They
had to lock the doors and restrain me from hurting myself. I wanted to 
throw myself on a glass table and through a window.’

The couple were staying with friends when he 'flipped' after returning from a country pub. Tests ruled out the episode was due to neurological or psychological reasons

At one point he found himself doing a recreation of a sketch from the Monty Python TV show. ‘I started doing very strange walks, like the Ministry of Funny Walks.

‘It went from scary to comical. I was trying to get into bags.’

Fogle asked to be restrained after a paramedic came. ‘I wanted them to give me a sedative to make it stop. The paramedic did some tests and knew that I had to go to hospital so an ambulance was called.

‘By now the whole experience took a different shift and it went from this aggressive episode into what I’d call a spacey moment.

‘In the ambulance they were saying to my wife he must be on some sort of drugs.’ He said the episode lasted about six hours and he ended up ‘very emotional and very teary’ on Saturday morning. Fogle spent about 12 hours in A&E. He said the hospital does not do toxicology tests so he could not find out for certain if his drink was spiked.

As a result he spent three days having tests on his heart and brain and being seen by psychiatrists.

Fogle, pictured with son Ludo, now three, is most angered by the fact that he handled his children while under a 'very psychotic drug'

‘I’ve spent the last few days genuinely worrying that I was going crazy,’ he said. ‘When you go through this and don’t know why you start questioning your sanity.

‘But five doctors have now concluded it was almost certainly drugs and have 100 per cent ruled out that it was neurological or psychological.’ He added: ‘I’ve always been 100 per cent certain that I was spiked, however unlikely the scenario.

‘Why would someone do it? I have no idea. It seems a bit of a coincidence that I was out with my wife and friends and I was the only person targeted.’  He said from what he has been told he is convinced it was the hallucinogenic drug LSD.

What most angers Fogle most about the person who did it is that he handled his children while under a ‘very psychotic drug’. Fogle has reported the incident to police.

He added: ‘What I’ve realised from my experience is that drink spiking is a big thing.’

Fogle, who sprang to fame after appearing in Castaway in 2000, had to postpone a five-week trip to Middle East for a BBC show while the tests were completed.

He appealed to the person who spiked his drink to come forward and explain what they had done. ‘I might stare at you for a while but I would forgive you,’ he said. ‘I just want to know what you put into my drink and into my body.’
