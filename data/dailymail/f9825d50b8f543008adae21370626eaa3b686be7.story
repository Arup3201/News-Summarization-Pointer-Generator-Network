One unlucky Financial District worker lost their appetite for lunch on Tuesday, after ordering a wrap from a Chop't salad shop and allegedly finding a much unwanted ingredient packed inside - dead rodent.

Pictures of the mouse or small rat, nestled in among lettuce and tomato, were posted to Twitter by two of the unnamed customer's co-workers.

'My colleague ordered a wrap and got a rat,' Forest Hills resident Steven Henderson tweeted earlier that afternoon.

Unpalatable: A customer who ordered a salad wrap from the Chop't location in Manhattan's Financial District found this dead rodent inside

The Chop't Creative Salad Company location at 80 Pine Street has had an 'A' rating by the NYC Health Inspector as early as September.

But the rat scare on Tuesday led the store to close for the day for a 'deep clean' Chop't founder Tony Shure confirmed to Gothamist.

Mr Henderson and fa fellow co-worker have since deleted their pictures and tweets about the incident. hoping to 'put #ratwrap2014 behind' them.

In an email to Gothamist, Mr Henderson said: 'I've had enough of this topic for one day. I saw your blog post. I've taken down the twitter post because it's caused quite the uproar and I need to get back to work.'

The two co-workers involved declined to comment further.
