Just weeks after being unceremoniously dumped by her fiance Rory McIlroy, Caroline Wozniacki is enjoying a flirtation with Spanish player Feliciano Lopez.

Golfer McIlroy, 25, announced last month the couple had split up after he realised he was not ready for marriage – just days after sending out their wedding invitations.

Until now, Wozniacki has asked journalists not to quiz her about her love life - with an apparent ban placed on reporters mentioning McIlroy's name.

But yesterday, Danish player Wozniacki, 23, giggled 
and blushed when asked about fellow player Lopez yesterday, describing 
him as ‘a great guy’.

Romance: Caroline Wozniacki giggled and blushed as reporters asked her about  Feliciano Lopez. The pair are rumoured to be dating - especially as the Spaniard has been seen at all of the Dane's recent matches

'Deliciano': Wozniacki said Lopez was a 'great guy' and that she had 'noticed him' on the sidelines at Eastbourne during the press conference - held after he first round victory yesterday

Split: The golfer, 25, announced last month he had separated from the Danish player as he wasn't ready for marriage. The couple had sent out invites to their wedding just days before the split

Spaniard Lopez took time out before 
playing and winning his first-round match against Yuichi Sugita to watch
 Wozniacki finishing off a 6-3 6-0 victory over Israel's Shahar Peer on 
Court 12.

The press conference followed her victory against the Israeli in the first round of the Wimbledon Championships.

Asked about Lopez’s presence at all of her recent matches, Wozniacki laughed: ‘You noticed that, huh?

'Yeah, I noticed he was on the sidelines in Eastbourne. He’s a great guy. This is awkward.’

When asked about how the Spaniard knows and respects her father, Wozniacki joked: 'He's already making his way in through my dad?'

Hard to get? The Danish player said she was 'happy' being single - and that it was 'pretty hard' to sweep her off her feet. Evidently trying to do just that, Lopez said he admired Wozniacki's father in a recent press conference

Later, when pressed about whether she had considered internet dating, Wozniacki continued: 'I think I'm not that desperate. I'll just see what happens.

'I'm perfectly fine being single at the moment. It's pretty hard to sweep me off my feet.

'It would have to take someone very special. I guess when you least expect it, it's going to come. Right now I'm just into my tennis. And playing here, it's great. That's what I'm focused on.'

32-year-old Lopez was dubbed 
‘Deliciano’ in 2011 by Andy Murray’s mother Judy, who revealed she was a fan of the player's good looks.

In a series of tweets, Judy joked: 'Ooh Deliciano… 
looking good out there. As always.'

Evidently mortified, her son hit back - saying her antics were 'disgusting.'

Crush: Judy Murray, pictured court side earlier this week left, dubbed Lopez 'Deliciano' in a series of tweets in 2011. Until now, Wozniacki has asked reporters not to mention her relationship with McIlroy, right

Following a four-set win over Ivan Ljubicic at the 2011 championships, Murray said: 'I think it’s about time she stopped that nonsense. It’s making me throw up. It’s disgusting.'

The player, who knows Lopez well, added his mother had been behaving inappropriately while the two had been practising.

The Scot added: 'I was practising with him before the tournament.

'It's quite funny because she’d been writing about it on Twitter like all the time. And I was practising with him before the tournament and my mum was on the side.'

Wozniacki will tackle Britain's Naomi Broady in her second round match - played today at 8pm.

Of the match, the Danish player said: 'I don't really know much about her, so I'll have to have my team do a little bit of research and some scouting.'
