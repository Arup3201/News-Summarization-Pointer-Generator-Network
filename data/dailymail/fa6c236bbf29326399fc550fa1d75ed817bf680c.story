The Cleveland Cavaliers made light of the ongoing absence of LeBron James, and an injury scare for Kevin Love, to end their three-game NBA losing streak against the Charlotte Hornets.

With James sidelined for a further two weeks with knee and back injuries, the sight of Love holding his knee was a concern for Cleveland.

But he continued in the game and top-scored with 27 points in his side's 91-87 success. Kyrie Irving added 23 while Tristan Thompson had 14 points and 14 rebounds.

The win brought Cleveland within four games of Central Division leaders the Chicago Bulls and 2.5 ahead of the Milwaukee Bucks, who lost 94-91 to the Indiana Pacers. The Detroit Pistons beat the New York Knicks 97-81.

The Atlanta Hawks lead the South-East Division by two games after they beat the Utah Jazz 98-92, Jeff Teague with 26 points, and the Washington Wizards lost 109-102 to the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Kevin Durant continued his roaring comeback from an ankle injury with 34 points, following up his 44 against Phoenix on Wednesday, and Russell Westbrook added 22 in Oklahoma's win.

The Brooklyn Nets closed the sizeable gap behind the Toronto Raptors in the Atlantic Division with a 100-98 win over the Orlando Magic, Mason Plumlee with 18 points and nine rebounds.

Toronto were on the receiving end of a 126-105 Golden State Warriors performance, Stephen Curry with 32 points and 12 rebounds while Draymond Green had 16 points, 11 rebounds and 13 assists.

That left Golden State five games clear of the Los Angeles Clippers in the stronger Western Conference's Pacific Division, with Phoenix a further four games back after a routine 112-96 win over the Philadelphia 76ers.

South-West division pacesetters the Memphis Grizzlies and Dallas Mavericks both won while the third-placed Houston Rockets were surprisingly hammered 111-83 by the New Orleans Pelicans.

Houston coach Kevin McHale rested his full starting line-up early in the third quarter and the Pelicans responded by winning the period 30-18. Ryan Anderson (22) and Tyreke Evans (21) led the Pellies in scoring.

Marc Gasol had 18 points and 10 rebounds in Memphis' narrow 109-106 win over the struggling Los Angeles Lakers while Rajon Rondo scored 29 points to lead Dallas past his former club the Boston Celtics.
