It's destination Qatar Sport Club for Wilson Palacios after the defensive midfielder left Stoke City and was in Doha to sign the deal.

The switch from the Premier League to the Qatar Stars League has come with little hesitation from Stoke, who were keen to usher the 29-year-old to the Britannia exit.

It was confirmed by the Qatari outfit after they tweeted: 'Honduras national team player and Stoke City's Wilson Palacios is in Doha to join Qatar Sport Club.'

2002-2008: Olimpia (102 apps, 32 gls)

2007-2008: Birmingham (loan) (7, 0)

2008-2009: Wigan Athletic (37, 0)

2009-2011: Tottenham (65, 1)

2011-NOW: Stoke City (38, 0)

Palacios has been held back by injuries since joining Stoke in 2011 from Tottenham Hotspur for about Â£6million, and fell down the pecking order.

There has been little room for the ex-Wigan Athletic player, and that was made more apparent with the summer arrivals of Steve Sidwell and Phil Bardsley from Fulham and Sunderland respectively.

Palacios started life in England on loan at Birmingham from Honduran outfit Olimpia, before signing a three-and-a-half-year deal at Wigan Athletic.

Stoke, who have also signed striker Mame Biram Diouf from Hannover 96, start their season against Aston Villa at home on August 16.
