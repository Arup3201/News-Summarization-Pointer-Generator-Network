The deadly albino cobra that was captured yesterday after slithering around a California neighborhood for days could have given a potentially deadly bite, this according to a snake expert.

'There's no indication that it's had its venom glands removed,' said Ian Recchio, curator of reptiles and amphibians at the Los Angeles Zoo, of the snake, caught in Thousand Oaks, California.

The venom of the albino monocled cobra can kill a human within hours of a bite.

Caught: This albino cobra was caught Thursday afternoon in Thousand Oaks, California 

The snake, about 3 feet long, was captured after being on the move since Monday.

Reports that it had bitten a dog that evening raised concerns, and authorities warned people to watch their children and keep their pets indoors.

A veterinarian later said it appeared the dog was simply injured while trying to get away from the snake.

Deadly: With intact venom glands, the bite of this cobra can kill a human within hours 

Animal control officers found the snake hiding in a lumber pile in the backyard of a house, and snared it using a long hook before packing it into a box.

The snake  was transferred Friday to the San Diego Zoo, which has a supply of antivenom for Asian cobras.

A monocled cobra gets its name from the ring-like mark on the back of its hood, but the cobra found in California lacked the mark because it is nearly pure white.

The blue-eyed snake lacks pigment, a condition known as leucism, Recchio said.

The snake probably was raised in captivity because its color would make it an easy dinner for predators in the wild, Recchio said. 

Recchio also said the snake appears to be healthy, and probably chowed down on rats and mice while it was loose.

'It looks pretty fat,' he said.

Trapped: Officers found the snake in a wood pile

The zoo didn't try to determine its sex.

'We don't have the antivenom here so putting your hands on it wouldn't be in the cards,' he explained.

Cobras are illegal in California without a permit to keep one for scientific or educational purposes. Authorities are searching for the owner.

There is a thriving black-market trade around the world in dangerous and exotic wildlife, but Recchio said he couldn't understand the motivation of the owner.

'I can't get into the person's head who would put their neighbors and their family at risk,' he said.
