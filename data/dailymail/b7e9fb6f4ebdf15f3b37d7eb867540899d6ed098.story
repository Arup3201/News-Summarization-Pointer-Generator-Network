Still a virgin: Zumreta Strsevic, 30, who was forced to get a report proving she had never had sex to quell vicious rumours about affairs at work

A Serbian woman asked doctors to vouch for her virginity after she was dogged by accusations of affairs with a former boss and other colleagues.

Zumreta Strsevic, 30, chief accountant at the Cultural Centre in the western town of Prijepolje, said she was fed up with hearing rumours about her sex life come back to her.

So she proved she didn't have one by commissioning a report from a gynaecologist which conclusively proved her virginity was still intact.

It is now evidence in a claim against her workplace.

'It got so bad that it was becoming impossible to do the job properly,' she was quoted as saying by Central European News.

'So I decided the only way to prove I wasn't sleeping with other people I was supposedly having an affair with us to prove that actually I've never slept with anyone.'

She told Serbian news website Blic that she realises the gynaecologist's findings means she will be subject to a new whispering campaign, but said she felt she had to do it to protect her honour.

'I don't care the price I'll pay to save face,' she said. 'I don't want to be drawn into their dirty games, and if they find any evidence of my alleged dishonest behaviour I'll leave work without saying anything.'

Rumours about Miss Strsevic's sex life spread so far they were even brought up at a meeting of Prijepolje's Municipal Council, Blic reported.

Miss Strsevic said the allegations were led by her current boss, who spread the rumours to colleagues.

'He accused me repeatedly over my alleged love affairs including one with a former director. When you make accusations like that, it sticks,' she said.

Hard worker: Miss Strsevic says she suspects rumour-mongers wanted her to move to another job 'because they don't want me continuing to check what they are doing with public money'

The career-focused bean counter, who had tackled financial irregularities at the Cultural Centre, said she had always focused on making a success of her business life before concentrating on her personal life.

'I don't know what they wanted to achieve with the rumours,' she said. 'Maybe they wanted me to move on to another job because they don't want me continuing to check what they are doing with public money.

'But at least now they know they can't get rid of me this way.'
