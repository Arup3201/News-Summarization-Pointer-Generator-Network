Award-winning Hollywood director James Cameron has received critical acclaim for his numerous hit films including Avatar, Titanic and Aliens.

But the multi-talented director is also a passionate deep sea explorer who last year became the first person to descend to the deepest place in the ocean alone.

He is now donating the submarine - called the Deepsea Challenger - he used for the trip to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in America for scientific research.

Cameron's dive took him to a part of the ocean no one has visited for 50 years - and he is the only human being to have travelled and returned solo

Cameron became the first to descend the 10.9km - almost seven miles - down into the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean, for
50 years - and the only person to have ever done it alone.

But he is now donating the submarine he used to achieve the incredible feat as he says cuts to funding for deep sea exploration is jeopardising research.

The submarine parts will be used as add-ons for other vessels but the Deepsea Challenger could dive again in the future.

Cameron told the BBC: 'I'd love to keep the 
Deepsea Challenger continuously operational. But I think that what I'm 
going for right now is what I call "potentially operational".

'My hope is with the sub's home now at 
Woods Hole, there will be a residential team in place - and they will 
have the knowledge of how to bring that sub back online.'

And if it does come back in service, Cameron will the first queuing up to get behind the controls.

He added: 'I'd like to go dive the sub again. There are a number of really, really 
interesting science targets out there. I would love to see the Deepsea 
Challenger dive in the Tonga Trench, the Kermadec Trench and the Sirena 
Deep (a 10.7km-deep part of the Mariana Trench).'

When Cameron travelled to the Mariana Trench, it took him two hours to reach the seafloor. 

He then spent several 
hours exploring the seafloor while 3D cameras captured images for a National 
Geographic film being released later this year.

Speaking after the dive, Cameron said he had hoped to see some strange deep sea monster like a creature that would excite the storyteller in him and seem like out of his movies, but he didn't.

All he saw were voracious shrimp-like critters that weren't bigger than an inch.

Protection: Cameron commanded the sub from a spherical cockpit - the best shape for withstanding pressure

He said: 'It was bleak. It looked like the moon. I didn’t see a fish. I didn’t see anything that looked alive to me, other than a few shrimplike amphipods in the water.'

The only previous manned dive to the Trench was carried out by US Navy Lt Don Walsh and Swiss oceanographer Jacques Piccard in a bathyscaphe called Trieste in 1960.

A series of dives - including Cameron's - in the last year have helped discover several new species.

The director told BBC News: 'As an absolute minimum, (there were ) over 68 new species - most are bacteria, some are amphipods, and there is possibly a new sea cucumber... and that number may go way up.

'There were also some quite interesting new species of giant amphipods that were 7-8in long when amphipods are normally 0.5-1in in size.'

Swinging above the docks in Guam's Apra Harbor is the Trieste, the submersible that took Don Walsh and Jacques Piccard on the first and only successful manned dive to the bottom of the Mariana Trench
