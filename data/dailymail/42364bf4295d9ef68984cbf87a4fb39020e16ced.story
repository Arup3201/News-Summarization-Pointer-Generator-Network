Police officers in Alaska's biggest city were pressed into service as cowboys, rounding up a couple of miniature horses that escaped from their corral. 

Worried residents had begun calling in after seeing the fairy tale-like animals on the loose during the beginning of their morning commute. 

The two little horses, one black and one tan, were found grazing on the sparse grass in the median of a busy four-lane East Anchorage street about 5.30am Friday.

The Anchorage Police Department 'were able to take these horses into custody' after they were found after 5.30 calls to the police

A photo tweeted from the Anchorage police department showed three officers with the two horses they apprehended. 

The tweet read, 'Some interesting runaways patrol came across this morning!'

Police spokeswoman Jennifer Castro tells Anchorage television station KTUU that officers 'were able to take these horses into custody.'

The horses were reunited with their owners after escaping from their corral and wandering a few blocks.

Castro said, 'You can call it our runaway juveniles for the day.'

No citations were issued, according to KTVA. 

It is not the first time Anchorage police have wrangled horses, but is thought to be the first time they have corralled miniature horses.
