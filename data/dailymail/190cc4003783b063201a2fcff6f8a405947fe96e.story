Mothers love them, babies love them, even the family dog loves them - and if you were to peek into the average Australian family's linen closet, you would no doubt find one.

The very first blanket that each newborn is wrapped in at most New South Wales hospitals is so popular amongst new parents that they often choose not to give them back.

A spokesperson from the Royal Hospital for Women (RHW) in Sydney admitted that it was a common phenomenon that the blankets simply disappeared.

'It's one of those unfortunate things that happen, some mother really do like them - they just go into the suitcase an no one is any the wiser,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'There's nothing special about them, but they are quite thick and warm for new born babies. It's just a fact of life that they go walk about.'

But for some mothers, the pink, white and blue striped blankets mean the whole world.

'My daughter was in the NICU after she was born, so we spent almost a week in the hospital,' Sydney mother-of-one, Melissa Wilson said.

'She was a winter baby, so the blanket kept her nice and warm and cosy! She was wrapped in it when we took her home and it's now a lovely memento of the first few days of her life.'

Ron Marks, who works for the linen supplier Health Share, said the company sends at least 300 of the baby blankets out to numerous New South Wales hospitals each day 

However, at least one third never make it back for laundering, Mr Marks said 

Other mothers have admitted to sneaking the blankets to their pets in order to accustom them to their newborn's smell and encourage a positive relationship between them.

One mum told Kidspot that her child's hospital baby blanket was tucked in beside her father-in-law who had died only a few weeks after proudly becoming a grandfather.

Each day over 300 of the baby blankets are delivered to a variety of public hospitals, and a few private hospitals, across New South Wales by Health Share.

Many mothers, like Melissa Wilson, admit the take the blankets as a memento of their child's birth 

But when they're sent back to the linen provider for laundering, at least one third are missing according to Ron Marks, the senior customer service relationship coordinator at Health Share.

Mr Marks said the blankets, known as Bunny Rugs, were a 'high loss item' despite not being an item with a high use.

'We end up needing to put a fair bit back into the circulation,' Mr Marks said of the blankets, which are sourced from a number of different providers. 

Joanne Coleman, the midwifery unit manager at Sydney's Royal Hospital for Women, said blankets are not the only thing that often go missing in hospitals, adding that hand sanitiser was another popular item

But baby blankets are not the only hospital items that are likely to be found in a patient's home.

'I think it's just like how we use this hand rub here in the hospital and we lose quite a lot of that,' Joanne Coleman, the midwifery unit manager at RHW, told Daily Mail Australia.

'People just seem to think that because we use it at the hospital, that's the way to go.

'Parents also take the blankets, but I don't know why – they're ugly! Although one of the reasons they might be taken is because people don't often come to hospitals prepared to take their newborn home and so when they are taking the baby home, they don't have anything to wrap them in and just take the blanket.

'We have had them sent back to us all laundered and with a thank you note, or sometimes the midwives in our home service program bring them back.'
