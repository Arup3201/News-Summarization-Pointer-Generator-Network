Ministers are set to use the controversial secret courts law in the case of a Libyan man who is suing the government over his rendition into the hands of Colonel Gaddafi’s torturers.

Abdel Hakim Belhadj and his wife were kidnapped and flown to Libya where he was horrifically mistreated.

He accuses the Security Services and former foreign secretary Jack Straw of serving him up to his torturers and is demanding compensation and an apology.

Accusations: Abdel Hakim Belhadj and his wife were kidnapped and flown to Libya where he was mistreated

At a court hearing yesterday, government lawyers said ministers were ‘likely’ to ask for intelligence and other secret documents to be considered under the new rules.

This could mean vast swathes of the case being held behind closed doors, with only State-approved lawyers allowed to hear the secret evidence.

The new law, which is due to come into force later this year, was bitterly opposed by civil liberties campaigners because of its extension of secret justice.

If the judge accepts the need for so-called ‘closed material proceedings’ it would likely be the first case in which the new rules are used.

It could mean Mr Belhadj and his lawyers being told little if anything about the evidence brought into play by the Government and used against him.

Instead, when the court doors were closed, he would be represented by a security-cleared special advocate.

Rory Phillips, QC for the Government, 
told the High Court it was ‘likely’ that an application for closed 
proceedings would be made.

‘It is likely that, subject to ministerial consideration, that an application... will be made,’ he said.

He also told the court the defendants, who include Mr Straw and former MI6 spymaster Sir Mark Allen, were still keen to settle the case.

He said: ‘They would be pleased to enter into a settlement process to draw a line under this case.

'(The defendants) would be pleased to enter into a settlement process to draw a line under this case'

‘The defendants for their part would like to reiterate...their willingness to sit down with Mr Belhadj and his representatives face to face.’

Richard Hermer QC for Mr Belhadj and his wife said the defendants were accused of false imprisonment, conspiracy to injure and misfeasance in public office.

The case revolves around whether ‘the defendants involved themselves in the rendition of the claimants to Libya and if so does that give rise to a private law course of action.’

Mr Belhadj has said he will drop the case for just £1 in return for an apology and admission of liability.

He claims he was snatched by the US in Bangkok in 2004, and held in a secret CIA ‘black site’. He and his wife were blindfolded and she was chained to the wall despite being visibly pregnant.

They were then flown to Tripoli where he was held for four years and tortured. The rendition took place around the time of the infamous ‘deal in the desert’ between Colonel Gaddafi and former prime minister  Tony Blair.

After his release he became a key figure in the uprising against the Gaddafi regime and is now a prominent Libyan politician.

After the fall of the regime, a document was found in the offices of Musa Kusa, Gaddafi’s spy chief which indicated Britain’s role. In it, Sir Mark appeared to take credit for the operation.

Describing Mr Belhadj by a pseudonym, he wrote: ‘This was the least we could do for you and for Libya to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built over the years. I am so glad.

‘The intelligence on Abu Abd Allah was British. I know I did not pay for the air cargo. But I feel I have the right to deal with you direct on this.

Another Libyan dissident, Sami al Saadi, 45, who was dispatched with his wife and four young children back to Libya where he was imprisoned and maltreated, settled his case for £2.2million earlier this year.

The Justice and Security Act, which contains the new secret court rules, gained Royal Assent earlier this year.

The new rules are likely to come into force in October. The preliminary hearing before Mr Justice Simon was adjourned. The case will return to court later this year.
