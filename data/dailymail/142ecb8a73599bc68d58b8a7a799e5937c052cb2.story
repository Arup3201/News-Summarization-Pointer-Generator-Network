PG tips has become the latest big-name brand to quietly shrink its product but not the cost – in a step likely to infuriate Britain's tea lovers.

The pyramid teabags are sold on the basis they contain exactly the right amount of tea for a perfect cuppa.

But each one now has had its leaves reduced by 0.2g, meaning a box of 80 regular teabags has come down in weight from 250g to 232g.

That is the equivalent of six teabags – yet the price of the boxes has stayed the same.

The change was made so quietly that it seems even supermarkets were caught by surprise.

Rip-off: Each PG tips teabag has had its leaves reduced by 0.2g, meaning a box of 80 regular teabags has come down in weight from 250g to 232g

This week, Tesco stores had shelf labels with a price of £1.99 for a box of 80 PG tips at 250g. But the boxes on the shelf were the new version, weighing 232g. 

The change was spotted by a former buying director for Tesco, Safeway and Nisa, Melvyn Searle, who said: 'I have never seen anything like this in my many years in the grocery trade.

'They have reduced the weight of tea in the teabag but not the number of teabags in the box.

'People are getting less tea and that must reduce its strength. It is very strange. I really feel that customers are being short-changed.

'This is one of the biggest tea brands in the country and people will rightly want to know where their tea has gone.'

The lighter teabags have resulted in the weight of other PG tips' boxes coming down, too. A box of 40 is now 116g instead of 125g, the 160 pack is 464g, not 500g, and the 240 carton is 696g, down from 750g.

Every day, 165million cups of tea are drunk in the UK. Ninety-six per cent of these are brewed from teabags. This means even a tiny reduction in weight can equate to millions of pounds of savings for manufacturers. But last night PG tips' parent company Unilever said that the weight change was due to a different mix of leaves – and that the tea still tasted exactly the same.

A spokesman explained: 'We've introduced a new blend and new bags whilst ensuring the same great taste of PG tips.

Sneaky: The change was made so quietly that it seems even supermarkets were caught by surprise

Spot the difference: This week, Tesco had shelf labels pricing a 250g box of 80 teabags at ��1.999 - even though the boxes on the shelves were the new 232g versions

'Our new blend includes a proportion of leaves that have been pressed to release a natural tea juice.

'This, combined with new paper, complements the blend, ensuring that the brewing time is unaffected and flavour of the blend is as great as it's always been.' The firm said it had tested its new bags with hundreds of customers who were happy with the flavour.

But Which? consumer group claimed the change was another example of 'Grocery Shrink Ray'. This is the increasingly popular trend for big-brand manufacturers to shrink their products without offering corresponding cuts in the prices.

The net result is a stealth price rise, because customers get less for their money.

Other culprits in the last five years have included Cadbury Dairy Milk, which reduced its 140g bar to 120g, Walkers Crisps (34.5g to 32.5g), Mars Bars (58g to 51g), Nestlé Munchies (150g to 126g) and Cadbury Creme Egg multi-packs (six eggs down to five). In all cases, the prices remained the same.

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'Shrinking products can be a sneaky way of putting up costs for consumers because pack sizes shrink but the prices don't.

'We want simpler pricing so that people can easily compare products to see which is the cheapest.'
