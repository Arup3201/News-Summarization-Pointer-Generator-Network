It is nothing new for England cricket captains to struggle against Australia when they take on one of the most demanding jobs in sport. More unusual is having to deal with a blackmail plot over your sex life within a month of taking charge.

Such was the alarming and, frankly, bizarre scenario facing Eoin Morgan last week ahead of England’s second defeat against Australia in a one-day triangular series also involving India here ahead of next month’s World Cup.

Yet Morgan who, until Thursday kept his private life very much to himself, has emerged from a startling affair that could have derailed his fledgling captaincy with the coolness and calmness that marks his promising leadership style.

Morgan's desire for privacy was thrown out the window this week amid a blackmail plot against him

On Saturday Brooke Tsakirakis, the woman at the centre of the unlikely scandal to hit the England team, broke her silence to publicly denounce the man who attempted to blackmail Morgan and back the beleaguered skipper.

Her words not only appeared to exonerate Morgan of any wrongdoing but would have been greeted with a huge sigh of relief from the ECB, who have spent the last year in turmoil since their Ashes thrashing the last time they came here.

‘I’m gutted and I’m furious,’ was the headline in Saturday’s Tasmania Mercury as it carried an interview with the ‘Hobart mum angry at being an innocent victim of cricket’s blackmail scandal.’

In it Tsakirakis who described herself, colourfully, as ‘ropeable angry’ distanced herself from the actions of her fiancé Nick Emery who demanded £35,000 to stop him revealing intimate details of a liaison between Morgan and Tsakirakis which apparently took place in Tasmania five years ago.

Crucially for Morgan and English cricket, she strenuously denied that she has been in contact with the Irishman in recent times, as alleged by her now ex-fiancé, and only had a relationship with him when both were single.

‘I don’t want to air mine and Nick’s dirty laundry but I’m gutted,’ said Tsakirakis. ‘I’m ropeable angry. I’m furious but I don’t think right now that anger towards him is worth wasting my energy on because I have to protect my children. They are my first priority.’

The ECB quickly called in Scotland Yard when they were contacted by Emery in Hobart, scene of Friday’s international, last Wednesday and by Thursday he had been tracked down. He was apparently remorseful and regretful and was quick to apologise for his actions. The ECB decided not to press charges but details of the affair emerged on the night before the match.

Tsakirakis said the messages relating to her relationship with Morgan were so long ago that she couldn’t remember them. She said it was just two people messaging ‘to and fro’. She believes Emery hacked into a deactivated Facebook account she had at the time she met Morgan.

‘Some of it may have been romantic or sexually explicit but it was nothing more than what any two people who are consenting adults independent of anyone else might say to each other when they fancy each other.

‘What upsets me the most are the reports in the media that Nick has said he had evidence of contact between me and Eoin in the last 12 months. I deny that completely. I have never been in contact with Eoin while I’ve been in a relationship with Nick. Well, Nick and I don’t have a relationship any longer.

‘I feel for Eoin and his partner because we are all innocent parties and I wish everyone well and to move on. I don’t even want to be vindictive about Nick but I’m not going to take responsibility for his actions.’

Morgan was the victim of a blackmail plot but the England captain's reputation has remained intact

Morgan has been in a relationship for three years with Australian Tara Ridgeway and she is said to be fully backing him over the scandal. He looked a distracted figure when he took to the Bellerive Oval on Friday and was dismissed first ball but had regained his usual composure after England’s narrow defeat.

‘It hasn’t been distracting at all,’ insisted Morgan. ‘I spoke to the ECB yesterday and I was very happy for them to deal with it. They just told me to focus on my cricket a hundred per cent and I’ve done that.

‘I was very comfortable with the ECB dealing with it,’ added Morgan. ‘I’m happy it’s all been cleared, everything is over and I’ve managed to get on with my cricket as I did today. It wasn’t easy when I came in. The ball was reverse swinging. I nicked one. It happens.’

And on Saturday Morgan was backed by England coach Peter Moores, who feels the Irishman has made an outstanding start to his one-day captaincy and has cleared this little unexpected hurdle in his path with ease.

‘He kept it out of the way of the cricket and away from the lads and moved on,’ said Moores of Morgan’s personal problem. ‘That’s what we want to do at the moment and Eoin got on with it yesterday. I think Eoin goes in with his eyes wide open with the England captaincy. It’s a high profile job, it’s a tough job, but also a very rewarding one.

‘I think he’s done really well. He’s kept the captaincy simple which is important and I also think he’s got the right level of having his own view and listening to others and being measured and making sure the players in the side have got a way of talking and shaping the way we go. We want the players to have a voice. It feels a calm dressing room and very committed as it should be. I think he can be well pleased.

‘He has an ability to handle pressure – getting a hundred in the first game at the SCG showed his ability to deliver when it’s tough. That’s something that will stand him in good stead going forward as a captain because over the next two months there are going to be some tough games.

‘I’d say since he’s been captain he’s seemed more relaxed. It’s early days, yes, but he seems happy around the lads and they seem very happy around him and you need that openness in the team. But you also need some direct leadership when a call needs to be made and he’s prepared to make them.’

Morgan has always prided himself on being a detached figure who remains something of a mystery even to Middlesex team-mates who are not even sure where he lives. 

Well, the events of this week have punctured that desire for privacy and he has had a rude awakening as to what the England captaincy can entail. To the relief of all involved he has emerged with his reputation pretty much intact.

It's been a difficult and testing week for Morgan in Australia but the England captain has not been derailed
