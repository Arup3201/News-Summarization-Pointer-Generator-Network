A new list out Tuesday reveals that America’s wealth isn’t just for the coastal elite by showing just how rich each state’s most monied top dog really is.

From Hawaii, where real estate mogul Jay Shidler reigns supreme to Maine, where L.L. Bean chairman Leon Gorman looks out onto his outerwear empire, these are the richest in each.

And while the ten richest, topped again by Washington’s Bill Gates and his $70.8 billion, haven’t changed since last year, their wealth certainly has.

Scroll down for full list...

Washington & America's richest: Bill Gates remains America's richest person. He also hails from the Washington, making him the Evergreen State's wealthiest individual

Pricey pad: The Microsoft founder's compound in Washington state was built with all the fanciest gadgetry, took 7 years to construct and cost over $60 million

Despite a sluggish economy, these elite among the elite are making even more this year than last.

Together, their combined $362 billion makes up 67 percent of the combined wealth of all 50 people on the list compiled by wealth analyst firm Wealth-X.

The firm wasn’t able to pin all of America’s billionaires and almost theres to a specific state, so for the ones who’ve renounced their citizenships like Dart Container Corp’s Kenneth Dart or only live in their home states in spirit like Walmart heir Jim Walton, they’ve used the person’s primary place of business as a guide.

The worth of the wealthiest 7 percent of households in America has gone up by around 28 percent since the financial crisis, reports ABC News.

The biggest winner of that crisis is also America’s second wealthiest man Warren Buffett, whose current $59.8 billion worth had an unbelieveable $10 billion boost thanks to the Oracle of Omaha’s smart investments while the market slumped in 2008.

This means Buffett is literally worth over a million times more than the average yearly household income in his home state of Nebraska, which is a mere $50,000.

Less surprising than number 2’s origins on the prairie, is number 3’s home state of California where the Golden State has truly lived up to its name for Oracle Corp’s Larry Ellison. Ellison is currently worth an estimated  $46.4 billion.

Easy going: Oracle CEO Larry Ellison is the thrid richest man in America and the richest man in California. Ellison's signature Woodside, California pad is modeled after an ancient Japanese emperor's residence and cost about $70 million. And with his $46.4 billion, he's also somewhat of a collector of homes

Kansan: David Koch is the richest man in Kansas but he's more likely to be seen gallivanting around East Hampton or Palm Beach with his many billions

Clocking in at number 4 is David Koch, half of the noted politically active Koch brothers who hail from the state of Kansas. David’s fortune alone is $41.5 billion.

And from one of the poorest states comes the fifth richest American—Walmart heir and CEO of Arvest Bank James Walton, worth $37.1 billion.

While his primary residence is listed in Bentonville, Arkansas, Walton is more likely to be seen on the golf courses of Palm Beach, Florida or the Hamptons, where he also owns homes.

Equally less at home in his home state, or perhaps more so, is Kenneth Dart, who took his $6.6 billion, renounced his American citizenship, and fled to Belize in 1994. Though, his business holdings peg him as Michigan’s richest man, according to Wealth-X.

Sin City: Like the Koch brothers, billionaire Sheldon Adelson has been known to use his money to sway national politics, though he hails predominantly from the state of Nevada, where he owns the Sands hotel

Made of money: Despite being a college drop out from the City College of New York, Adelson has made around $32.2 billion as a casino magnate in Las Vegas, Nevada and around the world

America's richest man remains Washington State's Bill Gates, who is worth $70.8 billion

But wealth resides outside the coastal states, with the top ten richest in America also hailing from landlocked Arkansas, Kansas, and Nebraska
