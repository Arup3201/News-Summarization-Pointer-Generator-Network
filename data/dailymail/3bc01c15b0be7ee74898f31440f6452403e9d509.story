To get my bearings on my first ever trip to the island of Mallorca, a helicopter ride seemed like the perfect idea.

From my vantage point hundreds of feet in the air, I could see all the way from the mountains to the beaches, taking in sheer cliffs and sparkling bays and everything from vineyards and golf courses to swimming pools, marinas and millionaire’s mansions. 

Mallorca, the largest of the Balearic islands, is spectacular from the air

There was Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones’ house, round the next cliff was the £30 million Mallorcan castle where Princess Diana reportedly stayed and just below me…

‘That’s Magaluf,’ says Jonny, my pilot and guide for the morning. ‘Down there.’

I peer down past my feet to what looks like just a few streets running parallel to a beach, with high-rise hotels and a few swimming pools visible from the air.

‘That’s it?’ I said. ‘That’s what all the fuss is about?’

Jonny laughed. ‘That’s why it’s good to come up here,’ he said. ‘It’s just tiny compared to the rest of the island.’

The high-rises of Magaluf seemed pretty small from my vantage point in the skies

While Magaluf seems to have the lion’s share of press coverage, there is certainly a lot more to the island than the infamous area known mainly for binge-drinking, sex-crazy Brits on their holidays.

Locals I spoke to during my week either despaired of the bad press – ‘People think the whole of Mallorca is like Magaluf,’ moaned one – or were relieved that the rest of the island was left unspoilt.

Many people had never even been there, even if they had lived on Mallorca for years. ‘Why would I, when there are so many much nicer places to see in Mallorca?’ said another.

The tiny hillside village of Deia is one of the island's prettiest and home to Lord Lloyd-Weber

After a week exploring the island, I could agree. At 62 miles across and 44 miles wide it is the largest of the Balearic islands and much bigger than I had expected.

My first port of call was the beach resort of Paguera, just 25 minutes from the main airport at Palma, where friends had booked their children in for a week at the Tennis Academy there.

Paguera is one of the closest beaches to the capital, Palma, and popular with tourists

While not the most glamorous town on the island, Paguera was actually rather nice – a pleasant main street and three sandy beaches flanked by a good choice of restaurants – and the island’s most famous son Rafael Nadal was even rumoured to have been seen at the tennis club much to great excitement.

Just minutes away is the stunning marina at Port d’Andratx. Having seen Mallorca from the air, it was time to see the island from the sea, so I went out for the day on a 52-ft Riva Rivale boat with Lorenzo and Francisco Vila, two brothers who charter luxury yachts for wealthy holidaymakers. 

Feeling right at home - on a £1.5 million luxury yacht which is often chartered by royalty

At £2,400 a day to hire, it’s not cheap but drinking wine on a £1.5 million boat in your own private bay certainly made me feel like royalty, which was fitting as the Vilas' customer the following day was a member of the Saudi royal family.

For lunch we moored the yacht and we dined on sushi and seafood at the popular Gran Folies beach club. Diners were shipped in on dinghies and could keep an eye on their luxury cruisers as they enjoyed a lengthy lunch overlooking the sea.

Back on dry land it was time to top up my tan at Mood Beach club, where I spent the day being served cocktails at one of its huge poolside beds, and then off to check out yet more yachts at the posh expat neighbourhood of Portals Nous.

Clubs such as Mood Beach (pictured) are where people top up their tans and then dance the night away

The capital Palma was yet another unexpected delight – behind the spectacular cathedral and riverside open-air cinema was a wonderful network of tiny streets where locals and holidaymakers alike ambled past people drinking in an array of delightful cafes, enjoying evening cocktails and listening to the sounds of jazz floating through the streets.

It was a surprise to find that my hotel which was surrounded by lush green golf courses wherever you looked (I was content to lounge by its beautiful pools) was just a few minutes from the centre of Palma.

Golfing is very popular in Mallorca and my hotel, just minutes from Palma, was surrounded by golf courses

Reverting to the more traditional transport of a hire car to explore the rest of the island I headed east to the seaside towns of Cala d’Or and Portopetro where I went on very different type of yacht, the 16m classic sailing boat Vita Bel II and dined out on Italian food while watching the sun set.

But the real highlights of Mallorca for me were to be found up in the hills. Twisting roads took me away from Palma and the coastal resorts to the beautiful village of Valldemossa and the Port de Soller, where I had lunch at the impressive Jumeirah hotel, perched high on the cliffs so swimming in the infinity pool felt like I was swimming straight into the sky.

My ultimate destination though was the picturesque village of Deia, home of Robert Graves which still attracts a creative crowd – locals include Andrew Lloyd Webber and PR guru Lynne Franks who runs women’s retreats in her amazing home overlooking the Mediterranean.

Over coffee Franks, who is currently down-sizing her home but remaining in Deia, told me that she had never been to Magaluf: (‘what’s the point?’) and said that the beauty of Deia is not only the scenery but the fact that so many people’s links to it go on for years.

‘It’s not like other expats parts of the island where people stay for three years and then go home,’ she said. ‘I know people here who’ve been coming to Deia for years and now their children are bringing their own children here. But it’s very inclusive here too – everyone knows everyone else as it’s so small you bump into everyone.’

La Residencia hotel in Deia used to be owned by Richard Branson and is popular with visiting celebrities

It does strange things to time too - my two days in Deia felt like a month. I visited the wonderfully preserved Robert Graves house and sampled some of the gardeners’ homemade spirits before reeling off into the sunshine, resolving to come back and live here, writing best-selling novels and making my fortune.

I explored Deia’s lovely shops, cafes and restaurants and had a wonderfully relaxing massage at Belmond La Residencia, one of the best hotels on the island with its spa and stunning views making it a celebrity favourite.

 I practically had to be prised out of my room the following morning – it had stunning views across the valley and a four-poster bed – but I was back that evening for its 80s disco on the lawn. 

There I danced the night away to Wham and Duran Duran, just near where Lord Lloyd-Weber was chatting with friends, before walking along the moonlit road to the Es Moli hotel across the valley. The real world – and especially the drinking dens of Magaluf – seemed wonderfully far away.
