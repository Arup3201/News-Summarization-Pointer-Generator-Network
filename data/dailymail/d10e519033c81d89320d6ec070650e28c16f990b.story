A suburban mother is behind bars following a string of suspected bank heists with her boyfriend.

Elizabeth Kenneally from Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, is being held in Bucks County Prison after CCTV footage allegedly showed her robbing three high-street branches with Christopher LeBlanc, 40, the son of a former mayor.

The 25-year-old, who has a two-year-old son, went missing on October 15 prompting her family and local authorities to hand out fliers and start a campaign on social media to track her down. 

Arrested: Mother-of-one Elizabeth Kenneally, 25, from Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, is being held in Bucks County Prison after CCTV footage allegedly showed her robbing a number of bank branches

Caught: She was reported missing by her family in October and was arrested on November 4 in a Delaware motel with Christopher LeBlanc, 40 

However Kenneally, who has a history of drug addiction and mental health problems, then told her local newspaper, The Mercury, that she wasn't missing and simply did not want to come home. 

The mother-of-one was arrested on November 4 in a Delaware motel just hours a after a suspected bank heist in Chester County. 

She was initially held on state charges, but is now facing federal charges relating to three robberies, according to Philly.com.  

According to the indictment filed on Tuesday in Philadelphia's federal courthouse, Kenneally and  LeBlanc robbed the Citizens Bank in Audubon Township on October 28th, a PNC Bank in East Goshen on October 31st, and a Citizens Bank in West Goshen on November 4th for a total take of nearly $5,400.

Delaware Online, reported that Kenneally, who has a 'Never Lose Hope' tattoo across her chest, faces charges in Pennsylvania of criminal conspiracy, robbery, theft by unlawful taking or disposition and receiving stolen property. 

Concern: Kenneally's mother Susan Puzio Bossley started a campaign on Facebook in a bid to track her daughter down. She told authorities that she has a history of drug addition and mental health problems

A federal grand jury has now charged her with three additional felony charges of bank robbery. 

While Kenneally was presumed missing, her concerned mother Susan Puzio Bossley, wrote on Facebook about her daughters troubles.

'My daughter needs help,' Bossley wrote on Oct. 20 on Facebook. 'So many families have someone that suffers, whether from drugs, depression, alcoholism, but some may not experience it first hand and don't understand.' 

She added that her grandson is in the care of her sister, Kenneally's auntie.
