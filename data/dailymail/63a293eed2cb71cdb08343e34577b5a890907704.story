Glamorous weather girl Nuala Carey has revealed some interesting romantic encounters outside her presenting job

Television viewers see the professional side of weather girl Nuala Carey as she explains the deep troughs and complex lows that will determine tomorrow’s weather on RTÉ.

But now the vivacious blonde presenter has revealed some surprising highs in her romantic life and some unsuspected celebrity connections.

The bubbly Dubliner, 36, has admitted to snogging famous actor Jared Leto and spending a night in the arms of Hollywood star Mel Gibson – though the latter encounter happened in the Wicklow mountains for a film.

‘I certainly don’t think I’m really wild but there definitely is a fun side to me that people don’t give me credit for,’ Nuala said. ‘It’s because of the job I do, it’s a serious job. I have to be professional, it’s only appropriate.’

In an interview with Suburbia magazine, the popular meteorologist says her career took an unexpected twist, developing from a passion for acting.

‘My life took a different turn than I expected because I was actually offered a place in Trinity College for their drama course,’ she said. ‘I turned it down so I made the decision to change my direction. I was afraid that I would be limiting myself. You could be the best actress in the world and still not be getting work. I was worried about that.’

She still dabbled in acting, however – working on Braveheart with international star Mel Gibson.

‘I did extra work for years. I worked as a body double on the film Braveheart. I spent a whole Friday night with Mel Gibson holding me in his arms in the woods in Glendalough and there were paparazzi hiding in the woods.

‘I was covered in fake tan because I was at a Debs the night before and they were trying to wipe me down. Mel was a lovely man but he was a flirt,’ she said.

‘It sounds amazing until I tell you that I was a corpse. You really don’t want to meet Mel Gibson when you’re wearing a long black wig, white make-up all over your face. It wasn’t as glamorous as it sounds but it was amazing to meet someone like him.

‘He was a real character, really charismatic and really chatty.’

But Gibson wasn’t the only star she had the good fortune to encounter; in fact, one of her friends is Love/Hate and Titanic actor Jason Barry and he introduced her to another global superstar.

‘I ended up in a hotel room with Jared Leto,’ Nuala said. ‘We didn’t do anything funny but I did have a little kiss with Jared. It was before he was with Cameron Diaz,’ she said.

Nuala said having a high profile could sometimes complicate her own love life.

‘People think you have a great life but sure everybody has problems,’ she said. ‘When I broke up with my boyfriend after seven years, I still had to go to work with a smile on my face. I couldn’t hide.’
