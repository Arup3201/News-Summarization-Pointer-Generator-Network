The former first lady Barbara Bush was taken to a Houston hospital today as doctors feared she was showing signs of pneumonia.

Though the 88-year-old's condition is stable, Bush received treatments for the potentially fatal condition throughout the day Tuesday.

It's not the first medical scare for Bush and it comes after a trying year for the health of her husband, former president George H.W. Bush.

Health scare: Former first lady Barbara Bush was admitted to a Houston hospital Tuesday for treatment of pneumonia

The former first lady was receiving treatment at Methodist Hospital, according to ABC News.

'Former First Lady Barbara Bush was admitted to Methodist Hospital in Houston's Texas Medical Center yesterday for treatment on a respiratory related issue,' family spokesman Jim McGrath said.

'She is in great spirits, has already received visits from her husband and family, and is receiving fantastic care.'

News of Barbara Bush's health concern comes at the end of 2013, a year of many such concerns for the former White House occupants.

Rough year: Bush was reportedly treated at Methodist Hospital, the same facility where her husband spent two months until January 2013 being treated for bronchitis

The Bush family matriarch had heart surgery in March 2009 for a severe narrowing of the main heart valve.

She also was hospitalized in November 2008, when she underwent surgery for a perforated ulcer.

In 2010, she was admitted to the hospital after having a mild relapse of Graves disease, a thyroid condition for which she was treated in 1989.

Bush, seen here with Princess Diana when she was first lady in 1990, was known for bluntness, but also for her polite and matronly manner while she lived in the White House

Barbara's husband George, the nation's oldest living former president, was admitted at Methodist Hospital in Houston on November 23, 2012 because of a bronchitis-related cough

He's spent about a week there earlier in November for the same condition and ended up staying for a lengthy two months before finally being released January 14, 2013.

Bush and his wife, Barbara, live in Houston during the winter and spend their summers at a home in Kennebunkport, Maine.

George Bush Sr. finally left the hospital early in 2013, but his wife Barbara is now kicking off 14 on a similarly concerning note
