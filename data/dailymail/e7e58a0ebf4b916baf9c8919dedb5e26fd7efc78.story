Two boys aged 12 and 13 have been arrested for trying to rob a bank in Israel using toy guns, police have said.

The boys were caught on CCTV as they entered a bank in Rishon Lezion, a suburb of Tel Aviv, wearing hoodies and holding fake rifles.

After threatening the bank clerks, the pair appears to have gotten cold feet, as they fled the scene without any cash.

Cops and robbers: The 12-year-old and his 13-year-old accomplice were caught on CCTV as they entered a bank in Rishon Lezion, a suburb of Tel Aviv

The 12-year-old and his 13-year-old accomplice, walked into the bank on Wednesday afternoon, holding schoolbags and fake rifles. 

Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said both were carrying fake M-16 assault rifles and that they shouted 'this is a holdup'.

'They were toy guns but they looked real. The people in the bank were scared, but then the suspects ran out without taking any money,' he said.

Mr Rosenfeld said Tel Avive police were able to identify the pair from the security footage and later arrested them.

Lawyer Gil Gabay said the children's rights had been violated.

'We are talking about children aged 12 and 13 who were arrested last night at 11pm. 

'They were investigated during the night against legal instructions. They slept on a chair in the police station,' he said.

'I think they should have been treated differently. I don't think they should have been treated like criminals.'
