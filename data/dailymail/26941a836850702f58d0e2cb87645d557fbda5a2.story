Go grease lightning: Theft of chip fat oil has soared as it is a cheap alternative to diesel

Thieves are stealing cooking oil from takeaways and restaurants to power converted cars.

Theft of the oil has soared in the UK as the price of petrol at the pumps has increased.

The crime, common in the United States and Canada, is relatively new to Britain.

Converting a car engine to run on 
vegetable fat costs around £200 but the money can quickly be recouped 
because buying the oil from supermarkets works out cheaper than 
filling up at the forecourt.

It is possible to convert used cooking 
oil to a fuel which can power any car capable of running on bio-diesel, 
although the 'home brew' equipment costs up to £1,200.

To operate most effectively the car ideally needs to have a diesel engine and will be around a decade old.

Sergeant Stuart Gunstone, a neighbourhood police officer in Ware, Hertfordshire, said there has been a recent spate of thefts in his area.

'Until now I haven't been made aware of it being a problem in the UK,' he said.

'It seems to be a specific group of offenders targeting a specific area. The problem is a lot of places leave their back doors open because it gets hot in the kitchen.'

In the latest raid, at a fish and chip shop in Ware, four tubs of used fat worth £80 were stolen.

Two other shops have also been targeted in thefts police believe are linked.

Fresh oil from the supermarket is exempt from VAT if sold as a foodstuff but an alcohol additive needs to be mixed in if it is to be used as fuel.

Fueling the future? A home brew kit to convert used cooking oil so that it can power a vehicle costs around £1,200

A few years ago the law changed to encourage people to experiment with new forms of fuel, meaning a motorist who uses less than 2,500 litres of chip fat fuel each year - 50 litres a week - wasn't required to pay any tax or duty.

Excise duty would have to be paid on any fuel above that limit at a discounted rate below the 20p standard charge.

The Centre For Alternative Technology runs courses in engine conversion and 'home-brewing' bio-diesel using chip fat and vegetable oil.

Experts say if all the conversion work is done properly, it should not reduce the performance of the car.

The 'home brewing' of vegetable oil takes around two days to complete and there's an element of risk.

Iit involves adding alcohol and leaving the mixture to stand overnight, removing glycerine - an unwanted by-product of the chemical reaction - and then 'washing' the remaining liquid with water to remove impurities.

In cold weather, bio-diesel is more prone to freezing. Using vegetable oil may invalidate the warranty with some manufacturers.
