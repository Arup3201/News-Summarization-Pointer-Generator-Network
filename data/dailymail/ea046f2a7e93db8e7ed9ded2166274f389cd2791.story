Chelsea continued their attack on Premier League referees after the club's official website published an article complaining that they have not been awarded enough penalties this season.

The piece called 'penalty puzzle' analysed how many spot-kicks the Blues have been given in each of the last five years.

The argument, that the number is 'abnormally low', echoes manager Jose Mourinho's view that there is a 'campaign' against the club.

Chelsea were angered last weekend by referee Mike Dean's refusal to award Branislav Ivanovic a penalty

The 'penalty puzzle' article leads the way on Chelsea's official website

At Old Trafford in October defenders John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic were denied a spot kick despite being wrestled to the ground.

Former Barcelona midfielder Cesc Fabregas was tripped during Chelsea’s game against Southampton at St Mary’s Stadium, but instead he picked up a yellow card for diving.

Jose Mourinho’s side appealed for a penalty against London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, only for the north London side to get away with handling the ball in their own box.

A blocked arm again denied the current Premier League leaders at home to Burnley despite the shot being clearly stopped by a raised arm.

Ivanovic was again left perplexed last Sunday at Stamford Bridge when visitors Southampton got away with yet another clear penalty against the Blues.

The article, with no byline, comes after Branislav Ivanovic was denied a penalty in last weekend's draw with Southampton, an incident the Chelsea website described as 'a clear spot-kick'.

However, general consensus, as outlined by Sportsmail's Graham Poll, was that the contact on Ivanovic, while undoubtedly present, was too slight to spot with the naked eye. 

The article also notes that Chelsea have received five penalties in just eight Champions League games, which they cite as evidence that the 'campaign' is limited to Premier League officials.  

Mourinho has been vociferous in his criticism of officials all season, first suggesting there was a campaign against his team in December, before appearing on Sky Sports last month after a challenge by Burnley's Ashley Barnes on Nemanja Matic went unpunished.

It is not the first time in recent weeks that the club's online team have sought to back up their manager's controversial view.

Last week the official Chelsea Instagram account posted historic pictures of Sportmail columnist Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness arguing with referees, after Mourinho accused them of having short memories.

Carragher had described the Chelsea players' behaviour against PSG, when nine of them surrounded the referee, as 'disgraceful'.
