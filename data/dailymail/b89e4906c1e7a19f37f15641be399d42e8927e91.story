A university professor, his wife, his sister and his two pet dogs have been found dead with gunshot wounds in their blazing Arkansas home in an apparent murder-suicide, police have said.

James Wilbanks, 41, who taught management at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, was discovered lying dead in the living room of the house in Maumelle at around 10pm on Friday.

The bodies of his spouse, Tatiana Wilbanks, 27, and sister, Elizabeth Wilbanks, 31, were located near the front door and in a bedroom. Two dogs were also found dead in the burning home.
