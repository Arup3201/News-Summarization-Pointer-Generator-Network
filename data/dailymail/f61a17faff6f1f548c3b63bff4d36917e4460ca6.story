James Attfield, who was found with more than 100 stab wounds, was described as 'shy and polite' by his family

Detectives are hunting a frenzied 
killer who stabbed a vulnerable father-of-five more than a hundred times
 in a town centre park.

Former
 barman James Attfield, described as 'shy and polite' by his family, 
suffered so many injuries it took eight and a half hours to carry out a 
postmortem.

The 33 
year-old, who had never fully recovered from a car accident four years 
ago, had multiple wounds to his hands, chest, back, neck and head.

His grieving mother said Mr. Attfield avoided crowded places and potential trouble spots and preferred a quiet life.

His mutilated body was found at dawn on Saturday in Lower Castle Park in Colchester, Essex.

He was last seen alive dinking alone in the nearby River Lodge pub where he sat at the bar for more than four hours.

Detective chief inspector Simon Werret, who has been with Essex Police for 27 years, said the murder was the most brutal he had ever seen.

He said: 'This was a violent, frenzied attack on a vulnerable man. He had wounds on his arms, hands, back, neck and head.'

Mr. Attfield's mother Julie Finch, of Coggeshall, Essex, said: 'James was known as Jim to his family and was always shy and polite.

'Four years ago Jim was involved in a car accident which left him with a brain injury and caused the left side of his body to be weak. The injury affected his reasoning and speech.

Final moments: Police have released these CCTV images of Mr Attfield drinking alone in the River Lodge pub

Investigators say the Mr Attfield spent more than four hours in the bar which is close to where his body was found

Officers say Mr Attfield left at 10.09pm leaving three quarters of a pint behind, described as 'unusual'

'Jim had always preferred going for a 
drink in a quiet 'old man's pub' rather than clubbing and never had many
 friends his own age.

'After
 the accident he was vulnerable and did not like going to crowded places
 as he knew he needed to keep away from trouble to avoid any risks which
 could lead to further injury.

'Jim was never the type of person to look for a fight and would always back down or walk away.

'Even after his accident he was always smiling and continuously challenging himself. He wanted to be the best he could be and always pushed himself to assist his recovery.

'Jim was loved by all his family and will be missed. Jim was a son, brother and father. My family and I would like to be given the space we need to grieve in private.'

Police are still searching for the murder weapon and are appealing for witnesses.

Castle Park in Colchester, where Mr Attfield was killed. Police are appealing for information on the incident

DCI Werret added: 'Jim was last seen in the River Lodge pub in Middleborough,Colchester on Friday night.

'He left the pub at 10.09pm, leaving almost three quarters of a pint behind, which is believed to be unusual.

'We do not know where he went between leaving the pub and being found injured in Castle Park at 5.45am on Saturday morning.

'Castle Park is used at all hours of the day and night and I'm sure someone will have seen something.

Mr Attfield was known for enjoying a quiet life and avoiding conflict

'Jim was not a confrontational person and would actively avoid risky situations and crowds due to his previous brain injury following a car accident four years ago.

'Jim did not have many friends and would drink alone. We still have no motive or suspect and no weapon has been recovered.

'Whoever was responsible would have come home with blood on clothing and possibly be injured themselves. If this is someone you know please call.

'Has anyone noticed a knife missing from their knife block? I would also ask people who live in the vicinity of the scene to check their gardens to see if a knife may have been discarded there.'

The detective added that Mr Attfield regularly visited the park and it was one of many routes the father-of-five could have taken to get home.

They said he had been living in a bedsit as a result of the accident, but refused to discuss his car accident.

They also refused to be drawn on his mental state saying his movements on the night of his death were 'normal routine'.

DCI Werrett refused to confirm whether Mr Attfield was still in possession of his wallet or phone when he was found by a member of the public.

Police have mounted extra patrols in the area and warned people to stay vigilant as the killer remains at large.

Superintendent Steve Ditchburn added: 'We remain concerned that we have not yet been able to trace the person or people responsible for this death.

'I would ask people to remain vigilant and to contact us if they see anything suspicious.'

Anyone with information is asked to contact the North Major Investigation Team on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
