Case: Kathryn Finch, 37, was today facing jail after having a secret relationship with gangster Carl Gordon, 27, who is serving life for murder

A prison clerk was today facing jail after having a secret relationship with a gangster who is serving a life sentence for murder.

Kathryn Finch, 37, shared dozens of illicit phone conversations with Carl Gordon as she worked at HMP Swaleside on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent.

Gordon, now 27, was locked up in 2006 after stabbing to death Michael Campbell, 21, in Turnham Green, west London, following a row over a vandalised car.

During his time at the category B prison, the former gym instructor also joined forces with arms dealer, Paul Alexander, to run an underworld gun ring from behind bars.

Alexander, 58, supplied weapons to the gang behind the murder of 11-year-old Rhys Jones, who was gunned down by Sean Mercer, 16, aided by six others, on his way home from football practice in Croxteth, Liverpool, in 2007.

During their relationship, Gordon and Finch exchanged 25 phone calls and more than 60 text messages between April 13 and May 31, 2011, Southwark Crown Court heard.

Adam King, prosecuting, told the court: ‘There were 11 calls and 31 text messages from Mrs Finch to Carl Gordon.

‘There were 14 calls and 32 text messages from Gordon to Mrs Finch. Gordon has been convicted of a firearms conspiracy going on during that time using that mobile phone.’

Finch today admitted a single charge of unauthorised transmission of an image of sound by electronic communication from within a prison.

The prison clerk had also been due to stand trial on charges of smuggling mobile phones for convicts in exchange for cash.

She was alleged to have offered her services to at least three male prisoners who were serving substantial sentences.

However, prosecutors dropped four charges of misconduct in a public office and 
two further counts of conveying a list B article in or out of prison. Finch denied all six counts.

Finch, who appeared in court wearing 
grey trousers, a pink vest and grey short-sleeved cardigan exposing a 
dolphin tattoo on her upper arm, now faces a maximum prison sentence of 
two years.

Adjourning sentence for reports, Judge Peter Testar said: ‘It’s plainly serious what she has admitted doing so I’m simply going to say that the probation service should consider all options open.’

Releasing Finch on bail, he told her: ‘I don’t know what is the right sentence in your case, it’s a serious breach of duty for somebody who is employed in prison so the court has to consider all options.

‘You must not think I’m making any sort of promises to you or giving you any sort of indication as to what sentence will be by getting a pre-sentence report.

‘You mustn’t think I’m making any promises to you by allowing you to stay on bail.’

Finch, from Eastchurch in Sheerness, Kent, is due to return to the court to be sentenced on June 5.

During his time at HMP Swaleside, Carl Gordon joined forces with arms dealer, Paul Alexander, to run an underworld gun ring from behind bars.

Alexander, a highly trained former Army sergeant, was
 arrested in 2008 by police investigating gangland killings following 
the shooting of Liverpool schoolboy, Rhys Jones.

Although the 58-year-old was not directly involved in Rhys's murder, his DNA was found on weapons supplied to the gang.

Rhys was just 11 when he became the innocent victim of a bloody 
turf war fought between two notorious Liverpool gangs, the Croxteth Crew 
and the Strand Gang from Norris Green.

After hearing rival gangsters 
were near the Fir Tree pub in Croxteth Park, Sean Mercer, then 16, armed himself with a gun and rode to the pub, before letting off 
three shots at his intended targets.

Rhys was hit by the second shot.

Mercer, who was aided by six others, was jailed 
for life with a minimum of 22 years for his role in the horrific crime.
