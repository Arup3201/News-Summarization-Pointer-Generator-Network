Warning: Motorists are being urged to check the mileage on MOT certificates to avoid being accused of illegally 'clocking' the odometer (file picture)

Millions of motorists are urged today to check the car mileage printed on new-style MOT certificates to avoid being accused of illegally ‘clocking’ their own vehicles.

The AA says innocent law-abiding drivers who fail to check the mileages printed on the new Government forms which were issued from last week may inadvertently be accused of turning back the mileage on their own cars if garages make mistake when writing it out.

As a result millions of motorists are facing an MOT ‘ticking time-bomb’, says the motoring organisation.

The AA warns today in a new report: ‘Car owners who put their vehicle in for an MOT test and fail to check the mileage on the new certificate, introduced last week, may inadvertently end up with their own ‘clocked’ car.’

It notes: ’The new certificate carries up to three of the previous recorded mileages. Should the MOT test station make a mistake, the car owner has only seven days to get the tester to correct the error and issue a new certificate. If not, the car’s mileage record is frozen and cannot be changed.’

AA head of public affairs Paul Watters said:  ‘What was designed as a security measure to deter criminal clocking may bite back on the unwary. It is highly unlikely that the tester will make a mistake but the consequences are serious enough for the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) to issue a specific warning.’

He said: ’It would be extremely awkward for an innocent owner to be accused of clocking a vehicle when they try to sell it on or get it re-tested, because they hadn’t checked the certificate.

‘With the clocking of vehicles rife in some parts of the country, threatening the safety and finances of used car buyers, the slight possibility of a mileage mistake during the MOT test is seen as a risk worth taking.’

Government statistics show that 28.2million MOT tests are carried out every year, of which 26.6 million are for cars.

The AA said there had been concern that the MOT certificate printed by the tester could be forged or tampered with: ’However, the new scheme allows a driver to check the mileage history on VOSA’s MOT computerisation database.

This underlines the importance of the MOT certificate as a guide to rather than an endorsement of a car’s roadworthiness, ownership or mileage validity.’

An official advice leaflet published by the Department for Transport’s Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) called ‘Your MOT certificate and Odometer history’ warns: ’If your MOT test was conducted on or after 18 November 2012 the MOT certificate will now show the vehicle’s recent mileage history.

'This has been introduced as part of a government initiative to reduce vehicle crime.

‘Where available, the mileage history will compose of the readings associated with the three most recent VT20s (test passes) along with the dates of those readings. This will be in addition to the mileage reading recorded at the time of the current test.’

It notes: ’It is important that you check all details on your MOT certificate at the time of issue so that any errors can be rectified. If you find a mistake in the mileage reading recorded for the current test, the MOT garage that conducted the test will be able to correct the error within seven days of the test and issue a replacement certificate.’

But the official VOSA leaflet adds:’Where an earlier recorded mileage is higher than a later one this could be caused by for example a speedometer replacement or a mistake by the Tester at the time of recording the reading. Alternatively it might suggest evidence of previous ‘clocking’ or tampering of the vehicle’s mileage.’

It stresses ominously: ‘Please note that if there is an error in one or more of the previous mileage readings then this cannot be changed.’
