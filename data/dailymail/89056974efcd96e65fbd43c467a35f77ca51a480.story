Alan Hutton's career has come full circle after he agreed a new three-year deal at Aston Villa. 

The right-back had appeared destined to be shown the door by Paul Lambert after a series of indiscretions, injuries and lack of form. 

Hutton was loaned out to Mallorca, Nottingham Forest and Bolton Wanderers but wasn't able to more a discernible impact anywhere.

He has, however, forced a way back into Lambert's plans and will stay at Villa Park into his 30s. 

Hutton has been an ever-present for the Villans this term and has forced a way back into the Scotland fold under Gordon Strachan. 

The 29-year-old has won 41 international caps and played in the gallant defeat away in Germany this month.
