Daniel Rodriquez jailed for a total of 12 years after an armed siege at his home in Kidlington, Oxon, in July last year

A man who took a cocktail of drugs before holding his two-year-old twin girls hostage in an armed siege was jailed for 12 years today.

Daniel Rodriquez, 38, from Kidlington, Oxon, armed himself with an air rifle and an imitation handgun as his daughters slept in their beds following a domestic incident on July 9 last year.

More than 50 officers in riot gear and 
armed with guns surrounded the family flat in the early hours of the morning.

The man twice fired at police as dozens of officers filled the streets for the pro-longed stand off.

Rodriquez took a cocktail of 
drugs including heroin, crack cocaine and valium while the police were 
outside frantically trying to negotiate the children’s release, a court heard.

Rodriquez was later restrained by officers with a Taser after the girls - wearing matching pyjamas - were carried from the property by police.

The man pleaded guilty to possession of two firearms and two counts of using the firearms to resist arrest.

Rodriquez was sentenced to 12 years behind bars at Oxford Crown Court today.

Prosecutor Rachel Drake described the terrifying siege to the court.

Miss Drake said: 'There was cordoning off of the areas and a very long siege situation involving negotiations between the defendant and the police.

'He was in a very agitated and distressed state and said he was considering taking his own life.

'Police were extremely concerned about the safety of the twin girls asleep in the bedroom next to the defendant.

'As the incident developed, the police were negotiating with Mr Rodriquez. About 9.30am, having supplied him with some food he passed down one of the girls.

'At 11.30am, the second of the children was passed through the window. There was no suggestion they were harmed during this incident.'

Despite handing over his children, the gunman still refused to come out of the flat.

Miss Drake continued: 'Mr Rodriquez was not prepared to give himself up to the police for many hours afterwards. His arrest eventually took place in the foyer of the flat at 3.50pm.

'Following the defendant’s arrest, a full search was made of the flat and the two firearms were recovered.'

The guns were found to be a .177 calibre air rifle and an imitation Colt Python handgun.

Rodriquez appeared in court via a video link in prison wearing a navy and white hooped jumper. He stared forward blankly during the sentencing hearing and only spoke to confirm his name.

At the time of his arrest, the father ran his own car wash firm Ace Power Wash Services in Kidlington, Oxon.

The court heard he had served six months in prison in 2002 for racially aggravated common assault, and had a string of convictions for theft, burglary, drug possession and ABH.

His most recent conviction was for burglary and theft in 2011.

In mitigation, his defence counsel Lucy Tapper said her client suffered mental health problems - including bipolar, depression and borderline personality disorder.

She told the judge that Rodriquez loved his children and never intended them any harm during the hostage crisis.

She said: 'The devastating cocktail of drugs and alcohol Mr Rodriquez had consumed, coupled with his overwhelming sense of anxiety and paranoia caused him to react in the way he did that morning when great numbers of police arrived at his house.

'The children were never, ever put in any direct danger by him. He had got them up in the usual way, got them breakfast and had them watching television. One officer reports hearing them laughing and playing in the back room.'

Judge Ian Pringle commented that it was an 'appalling' case and said Rodriquez’s possession of the firearms was an 'aggravating factor' in the case.

Jailing Rodriquez for 12 years, the judge said: 'Police staked out the house you were in with your two very small daughters. You released them one by one.

'That siege lasted until just before 4pm that afternoon - a serious aggravating feature of this case, no doubt brought about by your taking of a lethal cocktail of drugs over a huge period of time.'

Rodriquez had pleaded guilty to possession of two firearms and two counts of using the firearms to resist arrest. For those counts, he received four years in jail.

He was also jailed for eight years to run concurrently after he admitted three counts of rape and one sexual assault charge against a woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons.

Speaking after the case, Detective Sergeant Jim Homes, the investigating officer from Thames Valley Police said he was 'satisfied' with the result of what was a 'very difficult' investigation.

'It was a very unusual case, not one that we’ve dealt with before,' he added.
