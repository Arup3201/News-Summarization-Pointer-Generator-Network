Last week, I stood outside the school gates and had a frantic whispered conversation with my bank manager on my mobile phone.

I needed to cancel the £97 due to go out the next day to pay the gas bill or I wouldn’t have enough money to buy food.

The reason I was whispering? My seven-year-old son Ed attends an exclusive prep school in Chelsea, West London, and one of the other mums was walking towards me.

Where DOES all the money go? Despite her husband's £100,000 salary Mel Fallowfield says her designer purse is empty

Not for the first time I was painfully aware of the contrast between us.

She looked elegant in designer clothes and salon blow-dried hair. I was hot and scruffy, having walked for over an hour from my house to the school — to save on the bus fare.

It sounds ridiculous to admit that with a child in private education I can’t pay an essential bill without risking going hungry or scrape together the price of a bus ticket.

After all, my husband, who’s head of client strategy for an IT company, and I earn £100,000 between us.

Home is a lovely apartment in Kensington, just a few streets away from where David Cameron lived before moving to No 10.

Victim of circumstances: Mel says she is one of the squeezed middle class

We have an Audi A4 estate parked outside, I went to the Dominican Republic for half-term in February and we enjoy skiing holidays.

A few weeks ago we were at the opera and I wore a Moschino cocktail dress. I’ve got a Mulberry handbag and Cartier watch.

Not forgetting the fact that Ed attends a school where the parents include at least one supermodel and a world-famous footballer.

But scratch the surface of these trappings of wealth and a very different picture emerges.

The Mulberry handbag was a present for my 40th from a generous friend, who also took us to the opera, and the designer dress is 20 years old.

The trip to the Caribbean was a work junket and we can only go skiing because we stay for free at my brother’s home in Austria.

And my Cartier watch? Well, I took it to be repaired four years ago, but I’ve never been able to collect it as I can’t afford the £250 bill.

Sometimes I don’t have a penny in the world — scrabbling down the back of the sofa yields nothing.

It’s always touch and go whether the school fees, which are £11,000 a year plus extras such as uniform and trips, get paid.

I have nightmares about the teachers saying: ‘I’m sorry. Until you’ve paid the fees, Ed can’t come back.’

They don’t, of course. Instead I get a discreet letter a few weeks into term reminding me to pay. Then my husband’s salary drops into our account and we’re able to scrape together the cash.

Crammed in: Mel says her family's 'modest' £600,000 Kensington flat is too small for her family

I have no savings while a pension is a distant dream. And though our flat is in a desirable part of London, we’re crammed in as it only has two bedrooms. It might be worth £600,000, but that’s a modest amount in London.

The kitchen sink is leaking and the bathroom is falling apart. Needless to say, we can’t afford to get either of them mended.

We haven’t been on a two-week summer holiday since Ed was born; instead we descend on my long-suffering parents in Dorset.

One in five over 65-year-olds has more than £500 disposable income each month

So, where does our generous income go? The school fees swallow up a huge chunk and I know people will be baffled as to why we send our children to a private school when we’re so stretched. Partly it’s because I want the boys to enjoy the privileges I had as a child.

My father had his own financial services business and I grew up in Dorset with ponies, dogs and cats. I was educated at St Mary’s, Ascot, one of the country’s leading girls’ boarding schools. I assumed that my children would go to public school, too, and benefit from small classes and superior teaching.In the state schools near me there would be 30 children in a class; in Ed’s school, there are 15.

Then there’s four-year-old Bertie. His lovely pre-school costs more than £400 a month. My freelance writing job means the fees can be more than I take home some months, but he’s made wonderful friends, so I don’t want to move him.

And come September, his education will cost a lot more. Somehow we’ll have to find the money for him to go to Ed’s school — otherwise it’s not fair that only one gets the advantages. But I’ve had a few sleepless nights wondering how we will do it.

Crumbling finances: Mel has nightmares about not being able to pay her son's school fees

Then there’s my mobile phone: it’s always more than £100 a month. Gas and electricity are £140 a month and I can’t swap the providers because I owe them too much money after discovering our bills had been under-estimated.

Broadband, landline and cable TV comes to £100 a month.

When it comes to our mortgage, we’re tied into a fixed rate costing well over £1,000. Unlike other more financially savvy people, we didn’t get a tracker that would have saved us hundreds because of low interest rates.

People will wonder why we don’t move out of London where houses are cheaper. But I love where we live and my husband hates the idea of commuting.

We feel we had to have an estate car because of the children, and the Audi dealership near us was offering a good deal, so it seemed logical to go there. In any case, it’s been bought on a finance plan, so we can’t sell it.

I don’t like to compromise on cosmetics either. I’ll happily spend £50 on a pot of Clarins moisturiser. But when I can’t afford it, I go round the Clarins concessions in different department stores, pretending that I’m going away and can’t fit my big pot into my luggage, and ask for samples. Recently, that ruse kept me going for over a month.

I have to confess I smoke — though I have switched to Chesterfield at £6.25 a packet from Marlboro, which cost more.

I’m also rubbish at budgeting with the food shopping: I really couldn’t tell you how much a pint of milk costs.

I always fall for the three-for-two offers, not taking into account that we probably don’t want to end up eating roast chicken three nights in a row. 

No sympathy: 'I fully admit it's my fault. If I have money, I can't help spending it'

I’m under no illusion that I’m going to get any sympathy for my predicament. And I fully admit it’s my fault. If I have money, I can’t help spending it — chucking steaks in my shopping trolley and then wondering why the bill is more than £100. I find it impossible to stick to a tight budget.

But I believe I’m the victim of economic changes that have squeezed the middle classes.

While in the past those with a household income equivalent to  £100,000-plus would expect to own a decent-sized home, enjoy good holidays and be able to put their children through private school, static salaries combined with rising house prices and school fees have made it almost impossible.

Disaster: Rising house prices and school fees have made Mel's life almost impossible

At least I’m not alone in being incapable of matching my lifestyle to reality. One of my neighbours is planning to swap nurseries as she’s so embarrassed to be known as the ‘woman who’s always late paying the fees’.

Another friend’s husband has become a so-called ‘freegan’, rifling the bins at the local delis in Notting Hill Gate in the early hours to find thrown-out food for his family.

I’m thrilled he shares his spoils with me. Some days it’s armfuls of  perfectly good lettuces, other days punnets of strawberries. It’s always welcomed, because the fridge is often bare.

While the boys are fed nutritious meals, such as home-made (cheap) vegetable soup, my husband will often ask what’s for supper, only to be told ‘scraps’ or ‘leftovers’.

Scrambled egg on toast is a regular meal for us, though I’ve also served him cold fish finger sandwiches left over from the boys’ tea. If he’s away for work, I’ll skip supper and just have a handful of nuts.

Meanwhile, the boys’ after-school snack is often free pretzels we get from a stall in upmarket Westfield shopping centre.

I know I need to pull myself together and learn to be thriftier and not imagine that it will somehow all magically get better. It’s not as if either my husband or I stand to inherit a fortune. Neither of us have parents with oodles stashed away.

I worry that our precarious finances will finally crumble. While many women might dream about George Clooney, I fantasise about an accountant arriving at my flat to sort me out. Until he does I will doubtless continue lurching from one financial disaster to another.

So, the next time you spot a woman with a designer purse, just remember that it might have been a present (mine was) and it might well be empty — mine definitely is!
