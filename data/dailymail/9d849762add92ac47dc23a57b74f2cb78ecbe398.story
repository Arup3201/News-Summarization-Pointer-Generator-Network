Scientists have identified a gene which could help solve the problem of infertility in humans.

The team at the University of Edinburgh conducted a study with fruit flies, during which they found that when the gene SRPK is missing, chromosomes do not 'huddle' together.

They believe the huddling process is necessary to ensure the egg’s healthy development and fertilisation.

Chromosomes are thread-like structures which contain a person’s DNA, and when they divide it can lead to sterility and low fertility, according to the study.

Previous research in mice has shown that the huddling process is essential in order for eggs to remain fertile, the scientists said.

By identifying the genes involved in the process, the experts now hope to gain an understanding of what goes on in the creation of fertile reproductive cells.

Fruit fly eggs serve as a good model to understand why low fertility arises in humans, say the researchers

The team said further research is needed to help build a more detailed picture on how huddling works.

Professor Hiroyuki Ohkura, from the University of Edinburgh’s School of Biological Sciences, said: 'Fruit fly eggs serve as a good model to understand why sterility and low fertility arises in humans.

'By studying the phenomenon of chromosome clustering, shared by fruit flies and humans and identifying genes like SRPK we are gaining insights into fertility health.'

The study is published in the Journal of Cell Science and was funded by the Wellcome Trust.

Scientists from the Pasteur Institute in France and University College London shave previously found that a faulty gene could help explain some cases of unexplained male infertility.

Mutations of the NR5A1 gene were found in a small percentage of infertile men.

In the majority of cases, doctors can find no cause for male infertility, despite it accounting for up to half of cases in which couples have difficulty conceiving.

Male infertility appears to be more common within certain families, and this leads scientists to believe that there may be a genetic root for some cases, but only a handful of gene mutations which might be responsible have actually been found.
