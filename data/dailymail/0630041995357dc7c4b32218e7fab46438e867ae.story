Shares of Facebook slipped Thursday morning after the world's biggest social networking site surprised Wall Street by spending $19 billion on the messaging service WhatsApp.

Analysts that follow the company had mixed feelings on the deal, which Sterne Agee called strategically sound. But Pacific Crest Securities said it would have preferred to see Facebook grow organically, or at least act sooner on such acquisitions to avoid the sticker shock.

WhatsApp is a global messaging service for smartphones. It allows users chat with their phone contacts, both one-on-one and in groups, and well the sending of texts, photos, videos and voice recordings.

Facebook said Wednesday that it's paying $12 billion in stock and $4 billion in cash for the company. In addition, the app's founders and employees will be granted restricted stock worth $3 billion that will vest over four years after the deal closes.

The size of the deal dwarfs acquisitions made by other technology companies, such as Google's $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility or Microsoft's $8.5 billion acquisition of Skype.

Sterne Agee Arvind Bhatia said that WhatsApp comes with a large and rapidly growing user base that has a higher percentage of daily active users than Facebook.

Pacific Crest's Evan Wilson, however, said that it is hard to justify the valuation of both Facebook and WhatsApp if the social network does face significant competition from mobile messaging services.

He noted that the company's acquisition of Instagram, its reported offer for Snapchat and the WhatsApp deal signify that it does.

Shares of Facebook Inc. slipped 2 percent, or $1.38, to $66.68 Thursday about a half hour before markets opened. But the shares are still up more than 20 percent this year.

On Wednesday, Facebook announced it had snapped up the mobile messaging service WhatsApp for up to $19 billion in cash and stock in the firms biggest ever acquisition.

Facebook says it is keeping WhatsApp as a separate service, just as it did with Instagram, which it bought for about $715.3 million.

'The acquisition supports Facebook and WhatsApp's shared mission to bring more connectivity and utility to the world by delivering core internet services efficiently and affordably,' the social network said.

WhatsApp has more than 450 million monthly active users. In comparison, Twitter had 241 million users at the end of 2014.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says WhatsApp is on path to reach a billion users.

'The combination of WhatsApp and Facebook will allow us to connect many more people round the world,' Zuckerberg said.

'We want to develop more mobile experiences like Instagram and Messenger.

'WhatApp fits this vision perfectly, it has incredibly strong engagement and growth.'

'It's the only app we've ever seen that has grown more quickly than Facebook itself.'

'Their product roadmap is very exciting and won't change.

'Overall, I'm very excited about this deal.

'WhatsApp had every option in the world, so I'm thrilled they chose us.'  

Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's co-founder and chief executive has paid $19 billion for WhatsApp in a move which has taken Wall Street by surprise

As part of the deal, WhatsApp co-founder and Chief Executive Jan Koum will join Facebook's board, and the social network will grant an additional $3 billion worth of restricted stock units to WhatsApp's founders, including Koum.

Facebook promised to keep the WhatsApp brand and service, and pledged a $1 billion cash break-up fee were the deal to fall through.

WhatsApp will remain based in Mountain View, Calif., and Facebook said its own messenger app and WhatsApp's core messaging product will continue to operate as separate applications

Shares in Facebook slid 5 percent to $64.70 after hours, from a close of $68.06 on the Nasdaq.

Facebook was advised by Allen & Co, while WhatApp has enlisted Morgan Stanley for the deal.

The deal is the latest aquisition for Facebook, which last year bought Instagram.

It also reportedly offered to pay close to $3 billion or more to acquire messaging service Snapchat, though that offer was spurned by the site's founders.

Zuckerberg said WhatsApp would operate in the same way as Instagram, as a separate firm.

WhatsApp in numbers

'It would be pretty stupid of us to interfere,' he said.

He also said he was not planning to put ads on the service.

'Our strategy is to grow and connect people.

'Once we get to 2-3 billion people there are ways we can monetise.

'Now we want to focus on growing users. I don't think ads are the right way here.'

Koum also pledged not to add ads to WhatsApp, which makes money from a subscription model.

'We think advertising is not the way to go - we create a direct relationship with customers,' said Koum.

'We want to make the product better, faster and more efficient.'

Experts say the deal could help Facebook attract teens.

Professor Will Stewart from the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) said: 'Obviously WhatsApp adds instant messaging to Facebook which must strengthen their position for the moment.

'Equally, all app types rise and fade, so established social media formats like Facebook will be overtaken by something new, and picking up candidates that might have ultimately replaced them may be a good survival strategy for a while.

'This does show the growing significance of mobile, though of course Facebook is on mobile anyway.

'But, Facebook has been around a while now so the real question is what comes next?'
