A propaganda film commissioned by Thailand's military regime was supposed to promote the '12 core values' all Thai youths must learn.

But there was one scene the junta has had trouble explaining: a grinning schoolboy painting an image of Adolf Hitler while his smiling classmate applauds.

The video, screened before films in major cinemas since Saturday, has been met with ridicule on social media and condemned by the Israeli Embassy in Bangkok.

'Misunderstanding': The scene from a Thai propaganda film showing a young schoolboy proudly painting a picture of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler while his classmate applauds his efforts enthusiastically 

National myth: The video is supposed to promote '12 core values' to be imbued in all Thai youth 

A senior official in the prime minister's office, Panadda Diskul, said it was a 'misunderstanding', adding that the Nazi imagery in the cartoon scene would soon be replaced.

The 11-minute film tells the story of two schoolboys who learn to accept winning and losing is part of life.

Mr Panadda claimed the boy shown merrily painting an image of Hitler saluting beside a swastika was trying to compare his mother to a dictator, in essence a rebellious jest.

In the video, however, there is no such explanation.

The scene is part of a sequence without dialogue that depicts an otherwise normal day at school - the boys catching butterflies at a playground, doing experiments in a chemistry class and exercising on a karate mat.

It lasts just a few seconds and runs with a cheery tune playing in the background.

'The film is good, but it has caused a slight misunderstanding in our society,' Mr Panadda said. 'We won't stop the project, but we will replace that problematic picture with another, more proper one.'

The director of the film, Kulp Kaljaruek, told AFP he did not mean to cause offence but instead was trying to illustrate the child's moral progress.

'It's symbolic. The child is going in the wrong direction. But I didn't mean it (to show Hitler) in a bad way,' said Mr Kulp, whose father is head of Kantana Group, one of Thailand's largest film studios.

'You know Hitler had quite strong power in the past. But not in a good way. So it's like he (the boy) is learning from that until he becomes a good person at the end,' he said.

Mr Kulp confirmed the junta had approved the film but said 'nobody asked' about the contentious scene featuring the painting.

Israel's ambassador to Thailand, Simon Roded, said he was 'deeply saddened to see this trivialisation and misuse of Nazi symbols in an official Thai movie'.

'I was surprised that throughout the screening process this movie must have gone through to be approved for public broadcast, none of the smart, well educated people checking it had identified it as being problematic and offensive,' he said.

'If we learn anything from this incident it is that Holocaust education, especially its global messages of tolerance, should be introduced into the Thai curriculum.'

Images of Hitler, swastikas and other Nazi regalia are fairly commonplace in Thailand - adorning T-shirts and memorabilia - a phenomenon blamed on a lack of historical understanding rather than political leanings.

The study of history in the Thai school system revolves primarily around the history of Thailand and its long line of kings. World history is glossed over, with little or no mention of the Holocaust.

Last year, Thailand's Chulalongkorn University apologised for displaying a billboard showing Hitler with Superman and other superheroes. Officials said it was painted by students who did not realise Hitler's image would offend anyone. A Thai Catholic school was also left red-faced in 2011 after students dressed up in Nazi uniform for a sports day parade.

After overthrowing the nation's democratically elected government on May 22, coup leader-cum-Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha introduced the 12 values as part of a junta campaign to return 'happiness' to the people.

The values reflect traditional concepts in Thai culture the military felt needed reinforcing, ranging from upholding the monarchy to respecting parents and understanding 'true democratic ideals'.

Some student groups have hit back, calling the values, which highlight obedience towards the royalist establishment, a form of brainwashing
