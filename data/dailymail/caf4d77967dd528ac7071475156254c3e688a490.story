Thrill-seekers across Britain are still risking their lives by taking photographs of 40ft-high waves and defying police pleas to stay away from the coast.

Yet another man was last night pictured risking his child’s life to take pictures of the ferocious storms hitting the country - this time in St Aubin, Jersey.

Britain was today enduring the worst series of winter storms in more than 20 years - as people across the country prepared for even more flooding.

It comes after dramatic pictures showed how a student was nearly swept out to sea after he ignored warnings to walk out on a pier in stormy weather.

Ignoring warnings: A man risks his child's life to take a photo with his phone of the incoming waves at St Aubin on the coast of Jersey

Criticised: RNLI staff in Swanage, Dorset, slammed a man for standing at the end of a jetty in high winds with his pet dog

Dangerous: Two men peer over the edge of the sea wall at St Aubin to look at waves crashing against the coast

Meanwhile, searches 
resumed in south Devon for missing 18-year-old university student Harry 
Martin who was last seen leaving his home to take photographs of the 
weather - with more than 100 people volunteering to look for him.

Two
 people have already died in the storms. A 27-year-old man from Surrey 
was found on Porthleven Sands beach in Cornwall after he was swept out 
to sea on New Year's Eve night, and a woman died after being rescued 
from the sea in Croyde Bay, north Devon.

Officials
 around the country have pleaded with people to keep away as dozens put 
their life at risk by going to coastal areas to watch as the storm 
brought waves up to 40ft high crashing on to land.

A
 man and child were almost swept away by a huge wave at Mullion Cove in 
Cornwall as they peered over the sea wall to watch the raging sea, and 
elsewhere in Cornwall vehicles driving on a coastal road were swamped 
and almost washed away by a tidal surge.

Elsewhere
 in Cornwall, Sergeant Regie Butler pulled a man who had been drinking 
from the sea at Towan Beach, Newquay after he had ignored police 
warnings about the fierce storms.

Aftermath: The family looked completely drenched in Cornwall after the wave came crashing down over them on Friday

In
 Aberystwyth, Dyfed a man was rescued by lifeboat after he defied police
 warnings and became trapped when photographing waves from a harbour 
jetty.

In the town, debris 
was strewn across the promenade, rail lines in north Wales were left 
buckled by the power of the sea and a road collapsed in Amroth, 
Pembrokeshire.

The Environment Agency has already criticised people who lined the shore to watch the waves battering Britain's coasts.

'Clearly
 it is dangerous to get too close to these waves,' a spokesman said. 
'There is colossal power in these waves that can knock people off their 
feet. We would advise people to keep well away.’

A film crew were slammed today for staging a Porsche photoshoot at the spot where a father and child were almost washed away by storm waves.

Locals watched as the crew drove the new £43,000 Macan onto the harbour at Mullion Cove Harbour in Cornwall, as waves crashed around them.

The men, thought to be from Denmark, continued to photograph the 4x4 as darkness fell and the tide became even rougher.

They ventured out just 48 hours after a father, holding his daughter in his arms, was caught on camera being swept off his feet by a 20ft wave.

The near miss prompted further warnings from coastguards to stay away from coastal areas as Britain is battered by storms.

Local resident Dave Rich, 23, who witnessed the photoshoot, described how one man climbed onto the harbour wall to get a better look at the waves.

He said: ‘They arrived about 4pm and started to unload this Porsche off the back of a lorry and drove it all the way down to the bottom of the harbour walls.

‘The waves were still hitting the harbour quite violently so a freak one could have come up at any time and swept them off their feet.

‘There was a guy stood up on the wall telling them team when the waves were coming so they could take their pictures, he was just counting them down one by one.

‘I think in all they were there for a good 45 minutes but we left before they did as it was getting dark and quite dangerous, so they could have stayed much longer.

‘It was just so silly because people were stood on the cliffs, everyone who saw them were just amazed. There was a guy who was sat in the Porsche the whole time.

‘You never know if, or when, a rogue wave is going to break and if one had come as high as they have been lately the car, and the man, would have stood no chance.’

These dramatic photographs show how a student was nearly swept out to sea after he ignored warnings to walk out on a pier in stormy weather.

The RNLI were called to rescue Edward 
Laxton at 10am yesterday after he was spotted taking photographs on a 
jetty in Aberystwyth, Wales.

As
 the weather raged around him, waves lashed against the pier and swamped
 the 21-year-old first-year Aberystwyth University student.

Fearing
 for his safety, an RNLI team launched and rescued Mr Laxton from the 
end of the platform as the water threatened to engulf him.

Despite
 repeated warnings to the public to stay away from the coastline, the 
man had walked to the end of the wooden jetty taking images of the 
waves.
