A father has been refused permission to build an extension so his brain damaged son can get round-the-clock care because councillors say it would spoil the character of an upmarket neighbourhood.

Special constable Reece Clarke, 21, from Thorpe Bay, Essex, suffered devastating brain injuries as the passenger in a police patrol car crash in July 2011.

More than two years on, he is still in rehabilitation unit in Surrey and his father, Steve, applied for the bungalow extension so nurses could care for him there.

The father of Reece Clarke, 21, was refused permission to build an extension on to his bungalow in Thorpe Bay, Essex, so that his brain damaged son (pictured) can get round-the-clock care at home

Reece Clarke was 19 when, in July 2011, the squad car he was travelling in crashed and flipped over in Broadmayne, Basildon.

The special constable, based in Billericay and Wickford, was left with a brain injury, and multiple fractures.

He was treated at Southend Hospital before his parents won a fight to get him treatment in a rehabilitation centre. Now 21, he is being cared for at Banstead Place in Surrey.

A
six-figure compensation pay-out was agreed with police insurers in 
April after the family took the case to the High Court in

London.Wickford-based
officer PC Ian Thompson, who was driving the car, was fined £250 by 
Ipswich Crown Court in October last year after he admitted driving 
carelessly.

His colleague, PC Ian Thompson, was fined £250 by Ipswich Crown Court in October last year after he admitted driving carelessly. They were on their way to reports of an alarm sounding when the car was in collision with a taxi and flipped onto its side.

The scheme, to build a two-storey extension to the back of the bungalow, which already has a room in the roof, and extend the front, was accepted by planning officers but rejected by Southend councillors this week.

Out of 17 members of the development control committee, 13 voted down the conversion after almost 100 neighbours signed a petition objecting to it.

Councillors from across the political spectrum lined up to defend the character of the cul-de-sac, whose bungalows were designed by notable Southend architect and builder F W Goldsworthy.

Ron Woodley, independent councillor for Thorpe, said: ‘This application is a misguided attempt to turn a characterful bungalow into a full two-storey house.

‘The provision of roof lights to the first floor rooms and obscure glazing illustrates the unsatisfactory nature of this development.

‘It beggars my understanding as to why somebody would spend so much converting a bungalow into a sub-standard two-storey house when there are so many houses available.’

Fay Evans, Conservative councillor for Belfairs, said: ‘These are Goldsworthy bungalows. Old Mr Goldsworthy would be spinning in his grave if he knew what was happening.’

David Garston, Conservative councillor for Southchurch, who admitted considering moving to the close, said: ‘This would put extra stress and strain on Thorpe Hall Close, which already suffers problems with parking.’

Mr Clarke will lodge an appeal against the decision on Monday.

An independent planning inspector assigned by the Government will decide the appeal.

The rejection of the plans could delay Reece Clarke’s long road to recovery as he struggles to get over his mother’s death.

The former special constable’s devoted mother Wendy, who was his sole carer when he visited home, died unexpectedly in her sleep in October aged just 50.

Reece was heartbroken and his father, Steve, is scared to break the news that the conversion has been turned down for fear it could set back his rehabilitation further.

With tears in his eyes, 50-year-old Steve, from Shoebury, said: ‘I can’t tell him. If I tell him, he is going to flip. It might put him back a bit.

‘I kept promising him he would be coming home in June or July. If we tell him now he’s not, he is going to be distraught.’

Reece’s 18-year-old sister, Chelsea, who attended the council meeting with her father, broke down after the decision was made.

Before her premature death, Mrs Clarke with her husband had worked tirelessly to bring their son home from Surrey.

Reece struggles to show facial emotion as a result of his brain injuries, but he cried for the first time since his accident when told his mother had died.

Mr Clarke, who visited his son yesterday, now has to care for Reece himself when the 21-year-old visits at weekends.

Trying to stay strong, Mr Clarke, of Admirals Walk, said: ‘With his mum dying, it has put a strain on the whole family.

‘In the past two and a half years we have been fighting the hospital, fighting the insurance companies and I’m trying to get this sorted.

‘This would have been his chance to come home and get some normal life back.

‘I care for him at weekends and it’s killing me. It thought this would be the one.

‘I just feel they haven’t looked at the plans.’

Police insurers agreed a six-figure sum to buy and convert a house for Reece in April.

But no work can start until the plans are agreed.

Frederick William Goldsworthy built much of Thorpe Bay, including the Burges Estate.

Southend historian Arthur Woodward said Goldsworthy properties were characterised by a gothic, almost church-like arch at the front door, often with intricate carvings all around them.

Another trademark feature is tuck pointing, a highly-skilled and refined method of pointing, or re-pointing, red brickwork.

A thin pencil line of mortar will then separate the bricks to form a precise, raised, profile. This practice is rarely used on new properties nowadays.

Oak beams were another stand-out feature of the properties, and also play a major part of the bungalow on Thorpe Hall Close.

Mr Goldsworthy’s son Jeff continues the family firm F W Goldsworthy in Christchurch Road, Southchurch.

Mr Woodward said: 'It’s fair to say he built good quality properties across Southend.'
