Uruguay President Jose Mujica has defended his countryman Luis Suarez, saying that the match referee's decision should stand - despite Suarez's bite not being seen by Mexican official Marco Rodriquez.

The South American leader is the latest high profile figure to weigh in on the controversy, and he believes that FIFA are wrong to pursue Suarez for his alleged offense.

‘In football, I was taught that you obey what the referee says,' he said.

‘If we're going to take decisions in football based on what TV says, then there are loads of penalties and handballs you'd have to give that weren't given, so bad luck.’

The Uruguayans have so far been defensive of their talismanic striker, with their press choosing to focus on the national side's progression from Group D ahead of Italy after the 1-0 win.

Uruguay captain Diego Lugano had already denied that Suarez had bitten Giorgio Chiellini in a post-match interview - and has spoken out again, questioning whether a reporter had 'something against Luis'.

‘What incident? I don't know what incident you're talking about. I don't know what incident you're talking about,' West Brom defender Lugano said.

'Are you talking about the Premier League or the national team? Have you got something against Luis?’

Suarez had until 9pm on Wednesday to provide evidence to FIFA regarding the investigation into the incident that occurred minutes before Diego Godin score Uruguay's winner.

The independent disciplinary panel, chaired by Swiss lawyer Claudio Sulser, have a range of sanctions available up to a 24-match ban or a two-year suspension from all football.

A decision is expected on Thursday.
