Bigger bras are in demand. Two years ago, the classic 34B was the top-selling size at one of Britain's best known department stores.

Today, it's a generous 34DD, which suggests that women could be expanding too.

Those in the North, Midlands and Ireland tend to buy the bigger sizes, while women in the South and Scotland are a little less busty, according to sales figures from Debenhams.

Women's bust sizes have increased by three sizes in two years meaning many women have been squeezing into the wrong size bra

Wales, however, wins the biggest average bra award, with an E-cup being the bestselling size in its  stores there.

Nearly four in five women questioned in the Debenhams survey said they had squeezed into a bra that was too small for them.

The chain's head of lingerie buying and design, Sharon Webb, said there had definitely been a change.

She said: 'Sales suggest that breasts are bigger than ever before.'

And those that aren't are certainly getting a little help.

Padded
and push-up bras made up 70 per cent of bra sales in Debenhams stores 
this year, compared with  36 per cent in 2010.

It suggests that women are
keen to make the most of  their figures.

'Confidence is changing the shape of the nation,' Miss Webb said.

She
suggested curvaceous women such as Nigella Lawson, Dita von Teese and 
Beyonce were making other women feel more confident about their own 
fuller figures.

'Fit is of 
paramount importance,' she said. '

'A great-fitting bra makes you look 
incredible on the outside and feel fabulous on the inside.'

It's the women in the North, Midlands and Ireland who have the the biggest busts

During the month of October 50p from every bra sold will be donated to the Debenhams Think Pink campaign, which is donating funds to Breakthrough Breast Cancer, Breast Cancer Campaign and Pink Ribbon Foundation.
