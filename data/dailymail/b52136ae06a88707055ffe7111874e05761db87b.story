Skype murder: Ammaz Qureshi, 35, has been charged with the killing of a one-year-old in Norway

A British man has been charged with killing a one-year-old girl over Skype after allegedly instructing her Norwegian mother to submerge her in a bucket of water.

Ammaz Qureshi, 35, of Pinner, North London is said to have told his 28-year-old mistress to punish the child when her cries interrupted their online chat, and then watched as the toddler was tortured.

Qureshi is facing charges of premeditated murder and assault in Oslo after being extradited from Britain in December 2012.

Married Qureshi is accused of masterminding months of abuse against the child, including forcing her to eat chilli powder, making her to stay awake, and binding her legs for hours on end.

Qureshi, an accountant, was introduced to the Norwegian woman by her brother when she visited London in February 2010.

Despite having been married for seven years, he began a sexual relationship with her.

The woman returned to Oslo in April 2010, but the relationship continued online and over text.

Qureshi is said to have watched on Skype from his London home as his Norwegian mistress dunked the toddler’s head under the water after the child’s screams interrupted their online conversation in October 2010.

The second time she was submerged, she lost consciousness and the mother called emergency services. The girl died the next day.

When the mother was arrested, she told police Qureshi had been directing her to abuse the child since their relationship began.

Prosecutors claim Qureshi, who was not the father of the child, instructed Chaudhry to carry out cruel abuse against her daughter, such as spraying the girl in the face with a bottle of water, forcing her to sleep on the floor and had her head held under running water in the sink.

They accuse Qureshi of telling the mother to dunk her child in the bucket, which killed her.

Accusations: District Attorney Cecilie Schløsser Møller says Qureshi 'anticipated' the little girl's death

‘She was subjected to physical violence during disciplining. In the end, it went too far and she died,' Oslo District Attorney Cecilie Schløsser Møller told TV2.

‘By submerging the girl in the bucket, they would have anticipated her death. She was a small, defenceless girl who was subjected to extensive abuse.'

Qureshi has been in custody in Oslo for more than a year, following his extradition, and proclaims he is innocent.

'He denies the accusations of premeditated murder and assault. My client is baffled that he is accused of a crime committed in a country which he - at that point in time - had never set foot in,' Vibeke Hein Baera, defending, said.

‘He also says that he has not contributed to this in any kind of way, in fact the opposite.'

The mother denies premeditated murder, but admits abusing her child.

Trial is set to start this winter in Oslo District Court.
