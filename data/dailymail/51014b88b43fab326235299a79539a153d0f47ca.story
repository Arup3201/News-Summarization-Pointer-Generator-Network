Smart home technology sounds promising but the costs for individual devices soon add up.

Indeed a recent study found that making the average home 'smart' costs £1,509 ($2,519).

But now Canadian-based Piper has created an all-in-one security and home automation device that looks like a regular camera but syncs with an app that is used to control appliances.

Discreet: The small device (pictured in black on table) has a HD Panoramic camera with 180° fisheye lens and zoom alongside humidity, temperature and motion detector sensors

And because it works with an accessory called Z Wave plugs, the Piper and Piper nv (night vision) can turn even dumb gadgets, lights and more into smart devices.

Piper nv is on display at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.

The small device has a HD Panoramic camera with 180° fisheye lens and zoom alongside humidity, temperature and motion detector sensors.

Piper nv additionally has an infrared camera to make detecting intruders more accurate.

Once connected, users can remotely monitor the inside and outside of their house using the cameras. From the app, homeowners can turn on lights, turn on the heating, switch on the TV, play music and more

Security: Customise three security modes - home, away and vacation - motion detector and 105 decibel siren.

Automation: Integrate Z-Wave accessories into Piper’s security modes, control them remotely, on a schedule, or using environmental data.

HD Panoramic camera: 180° fisheye lens, electronic pan, tilt, and zoom, 1080p camera sensor

Customised alerts: Phone call, text message, email, and push notifications to users and their trusted circle when security rules are triggered

Environmental sensors: Monitor and control home temperature, humidity, ambient light and sound

Hardware: ARM processor, battery backup, internal memory for video storage, Wi-Fi.

App: Available on Android and iOS smartphones and tablets

Two-way audio: Talk directly to occupants through Piper through its app on your mobile device.

Multi-Piper setup: Supports up to five different Pipers within a home

Bedside mode: Featuring an active panic button, Bedside mode lets users manually turn on a siren in case of an emergency

If the cameras detect movement an alert will be sent to the homeowner (pictured) , and an optional siren will sound at 105 decibels

The device syncs with a free iOS and Android app and lets users set up three security modes - home, away and vacation.

Once connected, users can remotely monitor the inside and outside of their house using the cameras. 

From the app, homeowners can turn on lights, turn on the heating, switch on the TV, play music and more.

In fact, the app can control any smart device, or dumb device plugged into a Z Wave, so the possibilities are virtually endless and settings can be customised.

For example, lights can be programmed to turn on at a set time. If the cameras detect movement an alert will be sent to the homeowner, and an optional siren will sound.

This siren is 105 decibels - equivalent to sitting in a front row of a rock concert.

Or if the homeowner doesn’t want to sound the siren they can set up phone call, email or text alerts.

Alternatively, if a user is at home they can enable Panic mode. The Panic button sits permanently on their phone’s lock screen and is pressed to activate.

This sounds the siren to warn off burglars.

The app can also be programmed with ‘trusted circle’ contacts who are contacted in the case of emergency, or to check on the house if the homeowner is away and an alert is detected.

The original Piper, without night vision mode, costs €199 (£145) while the latest Piper nv is €299 (£217) each. Z Wave plugs start at €59.95 (£43) each.
