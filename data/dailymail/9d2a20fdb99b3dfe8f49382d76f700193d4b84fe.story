Gunmen shot dead three more aid workers running a U.N.-backed polio vaccination campaign just a day after similar attacks across Pakistan murdered five female polio workers.

The unprecedented killings are a major setback for a campaign that international health officials consider vital to contain the crippling disease but which Taliban insurgents say is a cover for espionage.

Suspicion over the programme follows reports last year that the CIA plotted a fake vaccination programme in Pakistan to snare Osama bin Laden's DNA.

Agents
 had reportedly started the vaccine drive against hepatitis B in 
Abbottabad, where they believed the Al Qaeda leader was hiding out just 
before he was killed, according to Pakistan officials and local 
residents.

In today's attacks, a woman and her driver were gunned down in their car in the north-western town of Charsadda.

Two
 men then opened fire on an 18-year-old worker as he was vaccinating 
children on the outskirts of the northwestern city of Peshawar.

The worker died of bullet wounds to the head, said Dr. Janbaz Afridi, the provincial director of the polio campaign.

Also in Charsadda, two female workers narrowly escaped when some men began shooting at them.

Local religious clerics and pro-Taliban lobby are reportedly trying to convince residents that the U.S.-manufactured polio drops were designed to sterilize Pakistanis and reduce the Muslim population

Despite The World Health 
Organisationâ€™s international vaccination programme, the disease has 
never been eradicated and continues to attack children in India, Nepal 
and Afghanistan.

After the number of cases spiked sharply
 last year, Pakistan stepped up its eradication efforts. The numbers 
fell from 173 last year to 53 this year, according to the Global Polio 
Eradication Initiative.

It 
has also re-appeared in Nigeria because of malicious rumours that the 
Western-donated vaccine is harmful, while a renewed threat to Europe 
has emerged from with eastern side of the continent.

It is caused by a virus which attacks 
nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. It is spread via human faeces 
and leads to muscle weakness and painful spasms, followed by paralysis 
and sometimes death when the lungs are affected.

Post-polio
 syndrome is believed to affect at least eight out of ten of the 
survivors. Although the syndrome was first described by doctors in the 
Eighties, the scale of the problem is only just emerging, as more polio 
survivors live long enough to develop it.

Polio has not been reported in Britain 
since the mid-Sixties, but there are a number of celebrity survivors, 
including actors Mia Farrow and Donald Sutherland, film director Francis
 Ford Coppola, celebrity academic David Starkey, and singers Judy 
Collins and Neil Young.

Three other female workers also escaped unhurt when they were shot at in Nowshera district.

Pakistan is one of only three 
countries where polio is endemic. Militants accuse health workers of 
acting as spies for the U.S. and claim the vaccine makes children 
sterile.

The Taliban in the lawless 
northwestern tribal region also blame the U.S. drone strikes for their 
opposition to the vaccinations.

On Tuesday, gunmen killed five female
 polio workers in a spree of attacks in several southern and 
northwestern cities, prompting authorities to suspend the vaccination 
campaign in the southern Sindh province.

The victims were shot in the head at close range, two of them as they administered vaccine drops to young children.

Four of the women were gunned down in
 the southern city of Karachi, and the fifth in a village outside the 
north-west city of Peshawar.

A man working on the anti-polio 
campaign was also shot dead down in Karachi.

The Taliban also killed three 
soldiers in an ambush of an army convoy escorting a vaccination team in 
the north-west.

The 
attacks in Karachi were coordinated and occurred within 15 minutes in 
three different areas of the city that are far apart.

In each case, the 
gunmen used 9mm pistols. Two of the women were 18 and 19, and the other 
two were in their 40s, he said.

The three-day campaign, which started on Monday, continued in the northwest and elsewhere in the country.

Taliban spokesman Ahsanullah Ahsan 
claimed responsibility for the attacks on Tuesday. There was no 
immediate claim of responsibility for Wednesday's killings.

The motive for the attacks is unclear
 but Pakistanis have viewed polio vaccination campaigns with suspicion 
since the death of Osama bin Laden.

The
 CIA's use of a fake vaccination program last year to collect DNA 
samples from residents of Osama bin Laden's compound to verify the al 
Qaeda leader's presence there. Bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces in 
May 2011.

Following the 
shootings the vaccination campaign has been suspended indefinitely in 
the north-west tribal region of Pakistan - Quetta, Killa Abdullah and 
Pishin districts.

U.S. agents reportedly started a polio vaccine drive against hepatitis B in Abbottabad, where they believed the Al Qaeda leader was hiding out just before he was killed, according to Pakistan officials and local residents

Government spokesman Noor ul Haq Baloch said. 'The reason behind suspension of the campaign is the security threat to workers.'

'At least six people working on a polio vaccination campaign have been reported shot dead in several locations in Pakistan -- Gadap, Landi, Baldia and Orangi towns of Karachi city, Sindh Province and Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province,' a statement from the World Health Organisation said.

'Those killed were among thousands who work selflessly across Pakistan to eradicate polio.'

There an estimated 280,000 children living in the tribal area were in need of polio vaccinations.
