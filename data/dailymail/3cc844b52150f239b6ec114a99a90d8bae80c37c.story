Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli was taken off in a behind closed doors friendly with Wolves after a heated conversation with referee Chris Foy.

The 24-year-old, who moved to Anfield from AC Milan in a £16million deal last month, appeared to be held back by Kolo Toure as Foy attempted to talk to him during the game at Melwood.

Sportsmail understands the Italian was involved in a robust 50-50 challenge with a Wolves player. No altercation took place and Balotelli was substituted soon after.

Toure put his arm around his former Manchester City team-mate as Foy spoke to him about the incident. Balotelli was later pictured leaving the training ground.

The ex-Inter Milan star had started the game with the likes of Adam Lallana, Jose Enrique and Lucas. The hosts ran out 1-0 winners against the Championship side, with Lallana scoring the goal.

Balotelli made his debut for Brendan Rodgers' side in last Sunday's 3-0 win against Tottenham at White Hart Lane.

He failed to score but impressed with his  movement in the box as the Reds returned to winning ways after a 3-1 defeat at Manchester City.

Rodgers had joked that Balotelli would bring 'trouble' to Liverpool, but insisted that it was worth the gamble to bring the Italy international to Merseyside.

Last month he told Sky Sports: 'Look at the talent. He's at a stage in his career where this is his chance. I've worked with those types of players all my life in youth coaching where I've never had the finished article.

'He needs to be consistent and if he can do that he will be one hell of a player. Most players I like to look in their eye and see honesty and humility.

'We went three-and-a-half hours talking it through. He's at a massive club. We can help him improve his game - he's a very bright boy and he knows this is his last chance.

'I'm excited to work with him and improve him as a footballer as well as a person.'
