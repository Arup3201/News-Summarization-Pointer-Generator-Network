Russia's Prime Minister was told exactly what his opponents think of him today when they unravelled a huge banner saying 'Putin, go away' on a rooftop facing the Kremlin.

A picture of Vladimir Putin, his face crossed out with an X, stared out from the black-and-yellow banner across the iced-over Moscow River towards the seat of Russian power.

Police quickly removed the banner - put up in protest at his plans to return to the presidency, currently occupied by Dmitry Medvedev, in an election next month.

Controversial: The banner, which was one of the first displays of anti-government so close to the Kremlin, was quickly taken down by police

Posters and chants urging Putin to give up power are common at demonstrations, sparked by claims of fraud in his party's favour in a parliamentary election in December.                 

But the banner, which bore the logo of the opposition movement Solidarity, is one of just a few such big displays near the Kremlin since he came to power in 2000.

Pavel Yelizarov, a Solidarity activist who stood in the cold on the embankment near the building, said: 'We think 12 years under Putin's rule is more than enough.'

A Solidarity leader, Ilya Yashin, said the banner faced the Kremlin because 'Putin was and remains the master of the Kremlin.'

taking over from the current leader Dmitry Medvedev (right) in next 
month's election

Support: Baristas in Moscow have been getting into the election spirit by creating Putin portraits, with cinnamon and cocoa powder, on top of cappuccinos

He wrote on his blog: 'He is the 
constructor and ideologue of the political system that has destroyed 
competition in this country.'

Putin
angered middle-class urban Russians eager for change when he announced 
plans in September to return to the presidency, which he held from 
2000-2008, in the election.

Polls indicate he will win a six-year term despite a decline in popularity and the biggest opposition protests of his rule, which are set to continue with a march in central Moscow on Saturday.   

Putin has promised limited political concessions but has at times ridiculed the protests and accused their leaders of being in the pay of the United States and Europe.   

Yelizarov added: 'We realised that the authorities are not listening to our protests, even after many thousands of people gathered. We're looking for new forms (of protest) demanding Putin leave office.'

Yashin said activists put up the banner - which was affixed to a billboard atop a seven-storey building - after climbing a fire stair and quickly left when they were done.
