Given what Tony Pulis has coped with before, the fact he calls the West Bromwich Albion job his toughest to date speaks volumes.

Harder than lifting Crystal Palace from bottom of the Premier League, six points adrift, to an 11th-placed finish in a limited time.

Harder than reshaping Stoke from Championship also-rans to top-flight heavy hitters, because of expectations.

Tony Pulis was unveiled as West Brom's new manager on Friday, as the club look to avoid relegation

Pulis has a remarkable record of never suffering relegation in 22 years of management, but he slapped down any notion West Brom, one point and one place above the drop zone, had suddenly found salvation.

‘Just because I’ve walked in the door doesn’t mean this club will stay up,’ was his stark assessment. ‘I think complacency is one of the worst words in the dictionary.

‘A lot of those people who are saying it haven’t been involved in trying to do it. It’s not easy. It’s a compliment, brilliant, but I’d rather have it at the end of the season.

‘There will be more pressure on the players to perform here than at Palace. And it’s such a short period. You have to give the chairman a lot of credit because he understands how serious the situation is.’

Prime among his tasks is energising the Hawthorns, which has been febrile for some time off the back of just four league wins at home in 2014.

He wants to act decisively in the transfer market and has identified targets to aid a team he watched earn a point at West Ham on New Year’s Day.

‘The one thing I said to them was at times I didn’t think they were positive enough,’ Pulis revealed. ‘There were times when we broke and had really good opportunities but instead of taking people on they were looking for that pass.’

Rob Kelly and Keith Downing will be in the dug-out today for the visit of Gateshead in the FA Cup alongside David Kemp, brought in by Pulis, who will watch from the stands.

He is ready to work with technical director Terry Burton to bring in players and will be supplied with funds by chairman Jeremy Peace. ‘I’ve got one or two in mind who I think can help us but we’re not down the line with any of them at this moment. It’s a very busy month for coming and going.’

Peace has previously said Saido Berahino, scorer of the equaliser at Upton Park, would not be going anywhere this month. However, Burton opened the door a little with Pulis now on the scene.

‘Tony is a totally realistic manager,’ said Burton. ‘He will work whatever way is best for the club. He tries to win matches and if he needs to sell somebody to do something else he will sell. Saido is worth what some club would pay for him.’

Even as things stand, West Brom require a striker of substance, as well as pace and genuine width. Pulis, 56, insisted he was happy with the structure of West Brom and his ‘head coach’ role - even if his style is very much as manager.

Pulis says he has spoken to his sacked predecessor Alan Irvine about life at West Brom

‘You can call me head bottle washer if you want, the title doesn’t make a difference,’ he said. ‘As long as I know there are specific areas I’m in charge of. Everyone understands our position. We have to be together to make sure the club stays up.

‘I worked with John Rudge at Stoke for 10 years. He was director of football and was never a problem. I’ve known Terry 20-odd years - I’ve no problem.’ 

Interestingly, Pulis spoke to Alan Irvine after he was sacked to do his homework on the club. He also spoke to former head coach Roy Hodgson and admitted comparisons were fair. ‘I think Roy likes being out working with players. We are Fifties children brought up the right way!’ he said.

‘You have different principles and ideas on life. People talk about three games in six days, but you compare what people go through in life to the players and it is laughable.’

The hard work for West Brom starts now.
