A grandfather who saw Jill Dando moments before she was shot dead claims police ignored his evidence about the murder.

Barry Lindsey said Miss Dando, 37, was confronted by her 'Mediterranean' killer on her doorstep in 1999 seconds before she was killed.

Mr Lindsey, now 61, told detectives to search for an olive-skinned man - but he claims they were only interested in evidence linking Barry George to the murder.

Released: Barry George wrongly served eight years in prison for the murder of Jill Dando before he was acquitted at a retrial. An eyewitness told police that Miss Dando's killer was in fact a man of Mediterranean appearance

Mr George served eight years behind bars for the killing before being acquitted after a retrial in 2008.

The 53-year-old was recently denied up to £500,000 compensation for being wrongly jailed after the Court of Appeal agreed with a minister that Mr George was 'not innocent enough' to be eligible for a pay-off.

Eyewitness Mr Lindsey told police in the days after the murder on April 26, 1999, that Mr George was not the man responsible for the murder outside the Crimewatch presenter's home in Fulham, west London.

'I told officers they needed to find a man with olive skin, dark hair and who looked like he was of Mediterranean origin,' he told the Sunday Mirror.

'But straight off, they said "We are looking at a local guy over this murder. He is called Barry George." They asked if I knew him and described what he looked like.'

He added that when he told police that Mr George was definitely not the man responsible they 'didn't want to listen any more'.

Victim: Miss Dando's real killer has never been identified after Mr George was acquitted of murder in 2008

Mr Lindsey was driving past Jill Dando's home in a green Range Rover which he was taking to a friend's house in Wimbledon when he saw her.

The father-of-five, who is a former print worker, claimed that he saw the television presenter arguing with a man.

He added: 'I hit the brakes, stopped in the middle of the road and looked through the back window. I will never forget the look on her face. It was one of absolute terror - her face had gone as white as the coat she was wearing.'

Although he considered intervening, Mr Lindsey decided to drove-off and heard a gunshot as he reached the end of the road.

He didn't know who Miss Dando was until he saw the story about the murder on the news that evening and realised what he had witnessed.

The eyewitness said the man had dark skin, looked Mediterranean, and was two stone lighter than Barry George.

Killing: Police search the road in Fulham, west London, for clues after Miss Dando, 37, was shot dead on her doorstep

Although he was interviewed at length by police and taken back to the scene, Mr Lindsey never heard from officers again.

Mr George said he fervently hopes he will live long enough to see Jill Dando’s killer brought to justice - but he very much doubts it will happen.

'The real murderer is out there somewhere but the police aren't looking for him,' he says. 'They needed someone to plug a hole and I was it – my life was disposable.'

Barry and his sister Michelle Diskin strongly believe that police used his disabilities to reinforce the notion he was  a weird, dangerously obsessive fantasist. He was born with brain damage which affects his short-term memory.

He also suffers from epilepsy and was
diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, which makes it difficult for him to
read people’s motives.

'The
police knew this but used it against him,' said Michelle. 'They would 
never have been able to do this if he had Down’s Syndrome, say, or was 
blind. I have to wonder whether they really believed he did it.

'You
see, at the time of the murder I was living in Ireland, my mother was 
elderly and unwell and our father wasn't around. The police must have 
thought that there was no one to fight for Barry, that a conviction 
would be easy.

‘They 
were so very desperate in all they did. They took cotton swabs to the 
cavity walls of his flat looking for forensic evidence.'
