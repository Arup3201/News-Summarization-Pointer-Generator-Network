Roy Hodgson prowled the turf in the searing Miami heat inspecting his England squad through his sunglasses, evoking the lyrics of Timbuk3 who claimed the future was so bright they had to wear shades.

Hodgson fitted neatly into the role of the ‘crazy teacher who wears dark glasses’ and his players were the pupils ‘who love their classes’.

Things were going great, although the most eye-catching among those players was undoubtedly Raheem Sterling, who cannot play against Honduras because he was sent off against Ecuador on Wednesday.

Out to impress: Sterling was looking sharp in training despite not being allowed to play against Honduras

With thrilling ease and fearless spirit, Sterling would keep collecting the ball and snaking towards goal with a trail of bodies in his wake in the eight-a-side games set up by Hodgson’s coaching staff at the Barry University sports campus.

He looked fantastic, free from concern over the red card and how it may affect his chances of featuring in the World Cup finals.

Hodgson has shrugged it off, too. The England boss planned to play him from the start against Honduras. ‘I even held him back a bit on Wednesday,’ he said. ‘As you can imagine he was absolutely gutted to be sent off, as were we.

‘But he 
doesn’t seem to have taken it to heart. The most important thing is he’s
 still making me aware he’s a player who can inflict an awful lot of 
damage on the opposition. He is an exceptional talent, along with our 
other exceptional talents. I don’t need to see a performance from him on
 the field to know he’s capable of playing in the Italy game if 
selected.’

Sterling
 scored one solo goal, which started with an audacious overhead backheel
 in midfield by Jordan Henderson. It was that kind of session and the 
local soccer fans invited to watch were impressed.

Captain
 Steven Gerrard agreed Sterling had been the ‘best player’ in training. 
‘Straight away after the red card I spoke to him in the dressing room 
and told him it was important to put himself back in the frame for 
Italy,’ said Gerrard.

As
 it stands, England have a happy camp. That’s unquestionable. Gerrard, 
all smiles and dry one-liners in his press briefing, said the mood was 
far more confident than it was four years ago in South Africa under 
Fabio Capello.

And
 Hodgson is revelling in the emergence of so many young and exciting 
players. Besides Sterling, Jack Wilshere looked impressive training at 
Barry University, who are famed for their soccer team — aptly known as 
the Buccaneers.

‘It gives you that headache all coaches say they want,’ 
said the manager, as he briefed the media in a room called Bucky’s Cove 
and stressed the need for 14-man games at the World Cup in Brazil, with 
substitutions more important than ever.

‘You
 don’t just have 11 players,’ said Hodgson. ‘You have players who are 
forcing their way into the team and will divide opinion. My favoured XI 
for Italy might divide opinion. That’s good for a start. It’ll give us 
enormous opportunities on the bench to change things around.

‘It’s
 going to be hot and most teams won’t be able to get through three 
90-minute games with the same team. I have the opportunity to make 
changes. It’s definitely going to be a 14-man game. You won’t see too 
many teams starting with 11 and finishing with 11, and you’ll see teams 
changing game to game as long as they have the depth to do that.’

England
 feel they have and Hodgson’s squad has been selected specifically with a
 view to using players for impact from the bench. Despite Sterling’s 
flair in training, his most likely role against Italy in 
Manaus on June 14 will probably be as a sub. The teenager has the 
ability to tear through teams if they are drained of strength near the 
end of a game in humid conditions.

‘We’ve
 got impact players,’ said Hodgson. ‘We’ve spoken a lot about Raheem 
Sterling and it’s a pity he can’t play. Ross Barkley is another you 
could put into that category. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is, too.’

Compared
 to England, Italy are trudging towards Manaus, without a win since 
September and unable to beat Luxembourg on Wednesday. ‘They’re due a win
 aren’t they,’ said Gerrard with a smile.

‘Be
 careful of going down that route,’ added Hodgson, drawing on his 
experience at Inter Milan. ‘I’ve worked in Italy. They have a much 
healthier attitude to warm-up games. It doesn’t bother them.’

Hodgson’s
 team will expect another work-out in the tropical heat against a 
hard-working Central American team cheered on by a crowd of 40,000, 
largely made up of Hondurans who live in Florida.

It will be hot and intense inside a stadium where there is no shade. Not unless the England boss is sporting his again.
