Benedikt Howedes and Julian Draxler have been training as normal after being involved in a motorsport accident which has impacted Germany's pre-World Cup training camp in northern Italy.

Formula One driver Nico Rosberg and professional touring car driver Pascal Wehrlein were taking part in an event with Germany's sponsors Mercedes on Tuesday when Wehrlein's car struck two people who were subsequently taken to hospital, with one of them being airlifted.

Howedes and Draxler had been riding in the cars at the time of the accident, which has left a deep mark on the mood at the training camp.

National team general manager Oliver 
Bierhoff addressed the situation at a press conference on Wednesday 
morning after visiting the victims in hospital.

'Both
 drivers are really shocked,' he said. 'The players too. They wanted to 
speak only briefly and then rejoin the group. There is great shock 
within the team.'

Howedes reportedly helped with the initial treatment at the scene but played down his role.

'I
 have done nothing that anyone else would not do," he said. 'In such a 
situation obviously you want to help. I think the images will remain in 
my head for some time. I have spoken with the coaches and the team and 
that has helped.'

Real 
Madrid midfielder Sami Khedira added: 'We talked in groups within the 
team, along with Bene and Julian. Such accidents can happen from time to
 time, but we must still focus on our work. We wish the best to 
everybody involved.'

Rosberg,
 who leads the 2014 Formula One drivers' standings after his win in 
Monaco over the weekend, said on Twitter: 'I am shocked by the accident.
 My thoughts are with the two people who were injured and I wish them a 
fast recovery.'

German daily
 Bild reported that Rosberg slowed his car to avoid hitting a spectator 
who had walked on to the track, followed by a marshal, and Wehrlein 
swerved to avoid him but hit the two people, one of whom was air-lifted 
to hospital shortly before 3pm local time on Tuesday.

Media: Rosberg, golfer Martin Kaymer and Pascal Wehrlein spoke to the German press earlier in the day

Accident: Two people were taken to hospital - one with serious injuries

Walk away: None of the football players were injured in the accident

A
 statement on Mercedes-Benz Motorsport's Facebook page said: 'An 
accident occurred during a visit to the training camp of the German 
National Football Team: while driving on a closed circuit, DTM driver 
Pascal Wehrlein injured two people whom he unexpectedly encountered 
walking on the closed course.

'We
 cannot offer any statement concerning the severity of injuries, as both
 injured parties are currently undergoing medical treatment.

'Pascal
 Wehrlein was uninjured in the accident. We deeply regret this accident 
and send wishes of quick recovery to the injured. We will work in full 
cooperation with the authorities in determining the exact circumstances 
of the accident.'

Rosberg, Wehrlein, Draxler and Howedes were not injured in the accident.

The Germans have been preparing for next
 month's World Cup at an Alpine hotel in northern Italy since last week 
and will remain there until June 1.
