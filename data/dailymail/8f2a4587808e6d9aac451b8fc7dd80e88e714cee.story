Monaco has become a byword for expensive transfers and world-class players once again in recent years with James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao passing through the club and restoring some of the lustre of the Glenn Hoddle and Mark Hateley years.

The glamour associated with AS Monaco had faded considerably when Russian owner Dmitry Rybolovlev took over in 2011, when the club were languishing in the French second division.

But having finished second to Paris Saint-Germain last season, Rybolovlev has scaled back investments, selling James to Real Madrid and loaning Falcao to Manchester United as the club attempt to establish themselves on an even keel.

Radamel Falcao was released by Monaco with Manchester United paying his £285,000-a-week wages

After shining in the World Cup, James Rodriguez joined Real Madrid for £63m last summer

Promotion under Claudio Ranieri in 2013 and an outlay of £140million, which also included the likes of Joao Moutinho, brought its own problem, with some French league sides complaining that Monaco’s tax arrangements — foreign players such as Dimitar Berbatov pay almost no income tax — constituted an unfair advantage.

Eventually, Monaco paid £37.5m as a one-off payment to the French League to preserve their unique identity. ‘The idea was to put Monaco back on the map of French football and European football as soon as possible,’ says vice-president, Vadim Vasilyev. ‘I think we did that. I think people recognise that we’re good as we attract attention to the French league.’

Monaco’s win at Nice on Friday leaves them in fourth place. ‘Our ambition is to win the title in the next few years and stay in the top three and be an important actor of the European stage,’ said Vasilyev. ‘We can’t be in the top 10 but we can be an important player.’
