An 18-year-old Oregon student confessed to stabbing his friend while being interviewed by reporters outside his apartment.

Cody Clarkson spoke with Fox 12 outside his apartment in Cedar Hill in the early morning of January 13, after his friend Teddy Peal, 21, had been taken by paramedics to the hospital.

In the broadcast video, a reporter asks Clarkson who's responsible for the stabbing and he responds: 'I did it.'

'It was a big misunderstanding is all,' Clarkson explains, 'Just drinking, fighting, trying to get to sleep before I go to school. He was making a lot of noise, names got called and that's it.'

Confession: Cody Clarkson, 18, admitted to stabbing his friend Teddy Peal, 21, while being interviewed by local reporters outside his apartment after the attack

Now Clarkson is facing charges of fourth-degree assault.

Authorities say the men were so drunk that it took them six days to conduct an investigation to surmise what happened.

'Mr Clarkson and the victim were drinking heavily,' said Sgt Vance Stimler, spokesman for the Washington County Sheriff's Office. 'Their mental state at the time played a major factor into the length of the investigation.'

The victim, Mr Peal, spoke with the Oregonian today explaining what he remembers from the night.

He says he and his brother went over to Clarkson's house on the 122000 black of Northwest Barnes Road Sunday night to drink and hangout.

Wound: Peal spent two days in the hospital recovering from a punctured lung. He posted a picture of his injury on Facebook

On his Facebook page, Peal wrote that he and his brother split a fifth of whiskey and that the bottle was already half finished by the time they arrived. When they finished that, all three men moved on to 40-ounce bottles of Mickey's Fine Malt Liquor.

Apparently it was unusual for the friends to be drinking that combination of liquor.

'I normally drink Pabst,' Peal said. 'Cody doesn't drink that much.'

That's when things started to get hazy.

Peal remembers his brother falling asleep at one point and then going out to have a cigarette.

Locked out: Clarkson allegedly locked Peal out of the apartment after stabbing him, and a neighbor had to call an ambulance for the young man

He doesn't remember the fight he got into with Clarkson but he thinks it was about noise.

'I guess I was being loud,' he said. 'And I guess Cody came downstairs with the knife and tried to shut me up.'

Arrested: The men were so drunk the night of the stabbing that it took police six days to conduct their investigation and charge Clarkson with fourth-degree assault

Peal says he doesn't remember being stabbed, and only realized he was injured when he looked down and saw that his shorts were soaked with blood.

That was around 3am. He didn't have his cellphone on him and Clarkson apparently locked him out of the apartment. He got help when the downstairs neighbor came out to tell him to be quiet and he told her to call an ambulance.

Peal blacked out and the next thing he remembers in waking up in the ambulance. He spent the next two days in the hospital recovering from a punctured lung.

That day, Peal posted on his Facebook page that he was 'In the hospital cause my so called friend Cody stabbed me in the chest and pierced my right lung'.

He also shared a picture of his wound, writing: 'There's my staples. It's going to be a fancy scar with that hardware on it.'

At first, Clarkson told police that he stabbed Peal in self-defense but after conducting an investigation, he was charged with fourth-degree assault.

Clarkson was booked at the Washington County Jail and released soon after. He is due in court on January 30 for an arraignment.

In his interview with the Oregonian, Peal said he's not ready to make peace with Clarkson.

'I'm not going to forgive anyone who's going to stab me over an argument, he said. 'That's no friend. I can't trust him.'
