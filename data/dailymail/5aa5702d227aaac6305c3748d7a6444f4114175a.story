The parents of the innocent Brazilian shot dead by anti-terror police revealed last night they received £300,000 compensation from Scotland Yard – but want more after learning police ‘spied’ on them after the tragedy.

The figure – far higher than previously thought – was disclosed by the couple as they said they would sue the force again over claims that undercover officers gathered private information about them after Jean Charles de Menezes was killed at Stockwell Tube station in South London in July 2005.

In an exclusive interview with the Daily Mail at their home, a modest smallholding near the remote town of Gonzaga in south-eastern Brazil, they said they felt ‘violated’ at the thought of the police intruding on their privacy as they were grieving.

'Violated': The parents of Jean Charles de Menezes, Matozinhos, 75, and Maria, 69, believe they deserve more

Mr de Menezes’s father Matozinhos Otomio da Silva, 75, said: ‘We are a humble couple, and since Jean’s death we have both suffered with our health. We don’t want to be greedy, but we could really do with some extra money.’

Mother Maria Otomio de Menezes, 69, said of the ‘spying’ claims: ‘It makes me feel sick. They ruined everything for us, and now we’re hearing that they didn’t even respect our right to grief in privacy.

‘There are no excuses that could justify that. Nobody has contacted us about this.

‘They probably think that because we’re poor Brazilians we won’t find out and we don’t need to know.’

Mr de Menezes, a 27-year-old electrician, was shot seven times in the head by officers who mistakenly thought he was a terrorist. An inquest jury later found the Met guilty of health and safety failings over its bungled operation but no officer faced criminal charges.

Details of the privacy intrusion which allegedly followed the de Menezes tragedy were outlined in a damning report on the activities of a now disbanded Metropolitan Police undercover unit, the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS).

Officers from the SDS collected information on 18 justice campaigns – including those concerning Mr de Menezes and the Stephen Lawrence case – which resulted in ‘collateral intrusion’ on family members.

Shot by mistake: Jean Charles de Menezes

The Met said it regretted ‘enormously’ the distress caused.

Mr de Menezes’ parents said they had not been officially informed of the allegations or received any correspondence from the Met since settling compensation with them in 2009, although their lawyers in London have been notified of the spying scandal. 

Mr de Menezes’s father said: ‘We went to London twice for the inquiry into Jean’s death, and both times our hotel rooms were booked and paid for by the police.

‘Now I’m wondering if we were being watched and listened to while we were in there.

‘It was the policemen who killed Jean who were being investigated, but now it turns out that Jean’s family and friends were being investigated. They admitted they’d got it wrong and Jean wasn’t a criminal, but then they treated us as if we were criminals.

‘I think it is unforgivable. If having our son taken from us wasn’t enough, they were also spying on our suffering and grief. It makes us feel violated.

‘We’re all told that Britain is a free country where people’s rights are respected, but we’ve seen something very different.’ The couple said that with the money they received from the Metropolitan Police, they bought a piece of land and a house in the nearby town of Gonzaga, which they rent out for £70 a month.

Mr de Menezes’s mother added: ‘We wanted to leave something for our other son, Giovan, and our three grandchildren. As well as the rent we get our pensions, but it’s only enough to survive.

‘For our lives to really change for the better, we needed a lot more than what we got. But no amount of money could have paid for my son’s death. They could have offered me the whole of London, I would have preferred to have my son back here alive.

‘I’ve never understood why they killed him without even asking any questions. He was a hard-working lad who was just trying to make a life for himself, and help his family too. How did he end up being mistaken for a terrorist?’

In 2009, the Mail revealed the de Menezes family had reached an out-of-court settlement with the Met but would receive reduced compensation because they were so poor. Sources said the undisclosed six-figure award was scaled down on the grounds that they could not have expected much cash support from their son.

Although the amount was covered by a confidentiality clause, sources said it would have been much higher if Mr de Menezes had left a widow and children or came from a wealthy family. But when he died his parents were subsistence farmers living in a dilapidated one-bedroom shack in the rainforest.

Above the road into Gonzaga, a sign reads: ‘Land of Jean Charles de Menezes. Victim of terrorism in London. Here we value life.’

The parents of Stephen Lawrence – who received £320,000 from the Met for the blunders that blighted the initial police investigation into his murder – could also be in line for more compensation in the light of the spying allegations.
