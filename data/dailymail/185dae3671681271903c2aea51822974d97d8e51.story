Worried police officers are now allowed to remove their names from their uniforms, in a change brought in after an increasing number of cops reported receiving death threats from criminals.

NSW officers pushed for the change to obscure their identities after they and their families reportedly received verbal abuse via telephone and on social media.

One male cop was allegedly warned he would be decapitated when  a western Sydney man - who claimed to be a member of terrorist group Islamic State -  called Rosehill Local Area Command.

Police Association of NSW president Scott Weber told Daily Mail Australia: ‘We’ve had officers targeted on Facebook, Twitter and trolled and attacked with threats against their families and this is why the commissioner has agreed to it.’

The move to replace name badges with registered ID number badges in NSW comes after Queensland Police already approved the change last year in response to officers being threatened by bikie gangs.

In Queensland, officers can also now choose to only display their rank and registered number instead of their name.

A police union source told Daily Mail Australia that criminals were remembering distinctive names and the move – backed by Queensland’s premier Campbell Newman 18 months ago - offers officers more protection. ‘People are very happy with it,’ he said.

Mr Weber said in NSW ‘all officers can apply’ to have their name badge swapped for a number. He denied that the move was about hiding their identities.

ID registered numbers are already in use in place of names in Queensland Police after officers were given the choice

‘It’s about making sure they are protected due to social media. We’ve had them be targeted and trolled and it’s not about hiding names it’s about protecting families in a heightened terrorism environment.

‘In the age of social media it’s paramount for officers to have some kind of protection,’ Mr Weber said.

Prompting the change were calls from officers who were worried about being identified at ‘protests or large scale events’.

‘This is what the officers have wanted for a number of times across NSW and that is what they’ve deemed they need.

When asked if a member of the community has the right to ask an officer their name, Mr Weber said: ‘There are still officers who will give their name and we have really good customer service in dealing with the community. 

'But the officer can just give a registered number if they feel intimated.’

One state that isn’t giving up its name badges is Victoria.

A Police Association of Victoria spokesperson said ‘We’ve had name badges for years and I don’t think there’s any move to change it.’

He said he hadn’t received any complaints from officers to move to ID numbers.
