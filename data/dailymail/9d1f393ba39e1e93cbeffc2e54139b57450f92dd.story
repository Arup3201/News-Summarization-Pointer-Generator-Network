The ‘spoiled’ cheerleader fighting a bitter law suit against her parents previously threatened to sue a teacher for kicking her out of the Homecoming dance because he thought she was drunk.

Senior tutor William Schilling spotted Rachel Canning out in the parking lot with a group of boys – including her boyfriend Lucas Kitzmiller – and thought they were acting suspiciously.

Earlier in the evening Rachel, now 18, had apparently been hard loudly boasting that she had Everclear, a brand of vodka.

Entitled: Rachel Canning, left, threatened to sue her school after she was kicked out of her Homecoming Dance because she was strongly suspected of being drunk of vodka

Bragging: Rachel was heard bragging by teachers that she had a bottle of Everclear. They searched her car, didn't find any and the teacher who hauled her into an office was convinced she was drunk

Above the law: Rachel, pictured in her Homecoming Dance dress, felt she had a case against the teacher

She was hauled into a school office and questioned while teachers searched the car she had been standing near.

They didn’t find any alcohol and she was cleared of drinking, but in Tuesday’s court hearing a lawyer representing Rachel’s parents Elizabeth and Sean revealed Mr Schillings had told them he was convinced she was drunk and would have been able to prove it ‘if he’d had a breathalizer’.

Despite that Rachel was insistent she was completely innocent – even though she was suspended for two days in the aftermath of the incident. She was so angry that, according to her parents, she started to threaten legal action against Mr Schilling.

In court documents seen by MailOnline, Elizabeth wrote: ‘Rachel also had starting threatening filing a lawsuit against Mr. Schilling from Morris Catholic for making her miss her Homecoming Dance’.

Explaining the incident she went on: ‘On October 12, 2013 we were contacted by Morris Catholic High School, and spoke with Mr Schilling, who advised us that Rachel was suspected of drinking and had been heard bragging loudly, inside the Homecoming Dance, and having ‘Everclear’, a grain of vodka alcohol.

‘Mr Schilling relayed to us that Rachel had been seen in the parking lot with her boyfriend and several other boys acting in a suspicious manner, which caused the Morris Catholic authorities to search their vehicle.

She added: ‘Mr Schilling also related to us that they had discovered plans for a post-homecoming dance alcohol party, presumably at our house, hosted by Rachel.

Not impressed: The judge hearing her claim that her parents should pay her school fees and maintenance even though she refuses to live by their rules took a very dim view of her case

‘Rachel was suspended for this behavior for two days by Morris Catholic, being placed on probation for the rest of the fall semester and not being allowed to participate in the Peer Ministry Group because of her behavior.’

Rachel’s version of events was very different. She wrote: ‘There was an incident where I was accused of being intoxicated at my high school’s Homecoming dance. I was found not to be intoxicated.’ 

But her alleged reaction to threaten legal action seems to demonstrate the kind of mentality that has led her to sue her parents for maintenance, college bills and legal fees, after claiming they abandoned her.

She even went on to allege that her mother was the cause of her bulimia because she called her 'porky' and that her father had an 'inappropriate affection' for her. However, Mrs Canning said the girl developed a 'hatred' for her mother because all she did was try to get her treatment for her eating disorder.

And a Department of Children and Families investigation cleared Mr Canning of any claims of abuse, with Rachel's parents claiming an official assigned to the case came to the conclusion she was just 'spoiled'.

Her pleas for immediate financial assistance were denied in a hearing at Morris County Court on Tuesday, but Judge Peter Bogaard set a trial date for April 22.

Rachel’s controversial legal battle is being funded by the father of her best friend, millionaire lawyer Jon Inglesino. The Cannings believe he is enabling their daughter’s behavior and encouraging her to take the matter to court.

She is currently living In their large mansion in Rockaway Township, New Jersey. 

War: Elizabeth and Sean Canning aren't just fighting with their daughter, but the Inglesinos - in whose home they claim Rachel had her first drink - and with the parents of her boyfriend Lucas Kitzmiller

Princess: Rachel even accused her mother of being the cause of her bulimia, claiming that Mrs Canning had called her 'porky' and 'fat'. Mrs Canning because she tried to help, Rachel developed a 'hatred' towards her

Sean Canning wrote: ‘The fact the Inglesino family has subsidized a lawsuit, rather than providing responsible guidance in abiding by a parent’s rules is not an acceptable society norm.’

Yesterday we revealed the parents claim in court papers that Inglesino, the managing partner at Inglesino, Wyciskala & Taylor and a member of Gov. Chris Christie’s School Funding Task Force – allegedly allowed Rachel to drink in his house.

Apparently when Rachel was a 15-year-old freshman she got so drunk on vodka at Inglesino’s home that she was sick all over the sidewalk and into a garbage can after her dad Sean picked her up for a basketball game.

And according to the Canning family, Inglesino’s wife Amy gave Rachel and her friends wine coolers in the back of a limo bound for New York on her daughter’s 15th birthday.

In an excerpt from explosive court documents, Sean – a retired police chief from Lincoln Park – wrote: ‘The Inglesino household, according to Rachel in the past, is more lenient. She would often tell us how the Inglesino parents would allow alcoholic parties to be held at their house….

‘Rachel’s first time drinking alcohol was at the Inglesino house, in March of 2011 and on other occasions including their daughter’s 15th birthday where they have freely provided alcohol.

‘Rachel came home bragging saying that during the limo ride to NY, Mrs Inglesino gave all the girls wine coolers to drink. This type of behavior we did not condone.’

The war of words between the Inglesinos and the Cannings is not the only family feud to have developed during the bitter legal dispute.

On Wednesday MailOnline exclusively revealed that the parents of Rachel’s boyfriend Lucas Kitzmiller are furious the Cannings are blaming him for making her ‘obsessed with alcohol’ and getting her suspended from school.

They also dragged his dad Jeffery and mom Lisa into the battle, saying they regularly brought the boozed-up pair home well after curfew, turning up at 3.30am on one occasion.

They gave Rachel an ultimatum that she had to either split up with her boyfriend, or move out. In one exchange between the Catholic high School girl and her father last November she wrote: 'Well I'm not coming home if I can't see him'.

Rachel refused to dump Lucas and actually moved in with his family for two nights, before relocating to the Inglesinos.

But Jeffery Kitzmiller defended his son and his wife, Lisa. He said: ‘My son has been painted in a questionable light by some of the comments from the Cannings.

'Their only experience of him is that he met the father long enough to shake hands. That's the only interaction they have ever had. They made their decision about him from that.

'If you read the court papers you can see the trend is with every boyfriend she's had it's always the boyfriend who's the bad influence. We have been dragged into this.’

Rachel’s chances of winning against her parents look slim after Tuesday’s initial hearing, especially after her pleas for immediate financial aid were shot down in flames by Judge Bogaard.

He was incredibly vocal in his criticism of the high school student. After reading an expletive-laden and vicious answerphone message left by Rachel, from Lincoln Park, New Jersey to her mother, in which the girl said: 'I wanna s*** all over your face', he said: 'Have you ever in your experience seen such gross disrespect for a parent? I don’t see it in my house.’

If looks could kill: Inglesino's children Jamie, left, and Lauren, right, glower at Rachel's father, Sean. The Cannings claim their daughter once came back from a party at the Inglesino house so drunk she vomited on the sidewalk

The judge added that Rachel had given her mom and dad: ‘The proverbial f you’. He also warned he must consider the 'slippery slope' where 'we open the gates for a 12-year-old to sue for an Xbox, a 13-year-old to sue for an iPhone… what about a 15-year-old asking for a 60 inch TV?'

Yesterday a Facebook account called ‘Education for Rachel’ appeared, apparently set up by the controversial teen. Incendiary posts were made defending her position and attacking other groups such as baby boomers.

One message read, ‘Educating children is first in parenting skills’. Hundreds of people, ‘liked’ the page and scores reacted with fury to her comments. But yesterday – despite certain media reports - Jon Inglesino confirmed to MailOnline that it was a fake account and had not been set up by Rachel.

Around the same time a page called, ‘In Support for Sean and Elizabeth Canning’ was set up.
