Arrest: Stephen Gough has been arrested walking naked through Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire. He had only been released from prison three weeks ago

A man known as the 'Naked Rambler' has been arrested again - this time in the lesbian capital of Britain.

Stephen Gough, 53, was detained as he strolled naked through Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, after a complaint from a member of the public.

His arrest comes three weeks after he was released from Saughton Prison in Edinburgh, where he had served a six-month sentence for repeatedly breaching the peace.

Gough, a former marine from Eastleigh in Hampshire, vowed to continue walking naked in his 'fight for freedom.'

He crossed over into England and had 
completed around 220 miles before his arrest on suspicion of breaching 
the peace at around midday on Wednesday.

Hebden Bridge earned the title of the
 ‘lesbian capital of Britain’ for having the highest number of 
homosexual women per head in the UK.

Speaking as he set off from prison on
 October 5, Gough said: 'I have no route or location in mind but my 
plans are to head south basically.

'I have no idea if I’ll be arrested 
again. I’ll just have to wait and see what happens. I’ll be fine in the 
woods but when I get to a town there could be trouble.

'When I’m not walking and it’s cold I do wear my clothes to keep warm.

'But I’m going to sort out my clothes
 from the carrier bags and put them in my rucksack and get on my way 
naked. Hopefully the weather will stay warm.'

Gough has spent most of the last six years in prison after being repeatedly jailed for breach of the peace.

He was last jailed for five months after being seen unclothed near a children’s play park in Dunfermline, Fife, on July 20.

But after being released he insisted 
that it was his right to walk naked and said the threat of prison would 
not deter him from being naked in public places.

He said: 'I’ve been in prison so many times during my life - over 20 times I think for various things.

'They treated me just the same as always this time round, like any other prison. I was in solitary confinement again.

'But I do this because I want to. I 
don’t know why the police and authorities have such a problem with it. 
I’m not hurting anybody.

'I want my freedom. But that’s the 
way it works for people who fight for their freedom, they get locked up 
for it. But I will continue to fight for freedom.

'There are a lot of totalitarian countries out there that people criticise but in some ways we aren’t much different.'

Gough was held for a breach of the police and this morning released. But this morning he was arrested in Halifax having enjoyed just 25 minutes of freedom. He will return to Halifax Police Station on November 2.

The town received the title after being found to have more lesbian people per head than anywhere else in the UK - including better known centres such as Brighton and Manchester.

It boasts many businesses run 
by, and aimed specifically at, the lesbian community - from dog walkers, decorators 
and fashion to wine bars and hotels.

The former mill town had been in steep decline until the 1970s when cheap housing attracted many people in search of alternative lifestyles - including artists and musicians.

Many of those attracted to its growing 'bohemian' reputation included members of the gay and lesbian community who began to settle in the area.

Sally Hines, director of the centre for interdisciplinary gender studies at the University of Leeds told the BBC that a 'progressive local government policy' towards supporting and financing LGBT [Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transexual]-friendly initiatives,' were also an attraction to those who chose to live there.

Once the town had an established gay and lesbian community - more people from those communities were attracted to living there.

Similar patterns have been noted in other areas with strong gay and lesbian communities, including Brighton and Manchester.
