Trial: Marcin Kostrzewa (pictured today arriving at Plymouth Crown Court) allegedly broke into his neighbour's flat and took the restricted files

A Polish man who tried to sell secret nuclear submarine documents he stole from his neighbour's airing cupboard has been jailed for more than four years. 

Marcin Kostrzewa was sentenced to four-and-a-half years behind bars after a jury at Plymouth Crown Court took less than an hour to find him guilty following a three day trial.

The court had heard how Kostrzewa broke into neighbour Shane Spencer's flat and took the restricted files.

He had become 'obsessed' with Mr Spencer after finding out he worked with subs.

Marcin later stole the paperwork after using English and Polish words to search Google using terms like 'spy games, spies and secret documents'.

Kostrzewa then contacted the Polish embassy and tried to sell the information for £50,000 but was trapped in an undercover sting.

He had denied committing the burglary between January and April 2014 and claimed he had found the contents in a bin as he was carrying out research for a spy novel.

The 31-year-old claims he just wanted to get arrested so he could meet a real MI5 Agent.

But jailing him for four and a half years, Recorder John Williams said: 'You are not the bumbling fool you have sought to portray in your evidence.

'In my view you are both calculating and clever. 

'You stole and sought to sell documents which you understood to be sufficiently sensitive and no doubt secret to warrant a large amount of money.'

He added that the loss of the documents could 'affect military operations' - though the metalworker tried to sell them to a friendly government.

In a statement read to court, Mr Spencer said he had been suspended from his work at Devonport Dockyard for Babcock Marine.

The court heard he had lost his high level of security clearance and was thinking of moving abroad.

Alexander Chalk, for the Crown Prosecution Service, said the Pole had previous convictions in his home country, including robbery and burglary.

He added the documents were marked restricted, the third of five classifications at the time, below top secret and secret.
