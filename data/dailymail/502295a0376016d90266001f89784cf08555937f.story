After a hollow winter of taking the positives from defeat, it would be churlish not to celebrate Saturday’s victory over Australia. It was built up as a must-win game, and England won. On a basic level they can do no more.

Yet the reflections of Australia coach Michael Cheika in the aftermath contained the tiniest note of warning.

‘We’ve got to be able to deal with scrums, to deal with bombs, those high balls and the mauling,’ he said. ‘I’m not worried. We’ve got something we are going to be adding on down the line that will do that. There are clear areas we’ve got to sort out but if we do it we’ll be all right.’

England's scrum was dominant and Australia simply did not know how to deal with it on Saturday

Maybe he was whistling to keep his spirits up. The dominance of England’s forwards was such that it is hard to imagine Australia finding players of equivalent impact and stature in the next 12 months.

With the nations due to face each other in World Cup Group A it was important England held the psychological advantage of maintaining supremacy over Australia at HQ - as they have done on three of the last four meetings - and they did. Yet what if Cheika does work his miracle?

There is no doubt England were playing Australia at their least prepared and familiar under him. If he is the coach his track record suggests, they will improve.

And this was a victory earned in one facet of the game. It is an important aspect, and can drive a team to victory against the toughest opponents, but if Australia discover a way to match England’s scrum and maul - the vague add-on that Cheika hopes will bring change - what then?

So take the positives by all means - they were deserved - but let’s not get carried away. England were the only nation of note to lose to South Africa this winter and Australia are the southern hemisphere’s work in progress.

They have players missing - as have England - Cheika has been in the job one month and the team were at the end of a spiteful run of 15 Tests in 25 weeks. This is their worst winter in nine years and they have dropped to fifth in the world rankings, their poorest position since 2008.

Having been criticised for losing to New Zealand and South Africa, it would be harsh to deny England their due, but this was a win achieved in a very specific way. Australia’s running rugby was superior. Some better decision-making or tighter passing near the try line and it could have been very different.

England’s performance was of the bloody, battered, fight-to-a-standstill variety. Courtney Lawes, along with Ben Morgan the man of the match, made 12 tackles in the first hour - a remarkable number for a second row.

In total, England delivered 158 tackles to Australia’s 48 and if it didn’t feel like the Alamo that was because England’s forwards were so dominant the home team were behind for only three of 80 minutes and led for 68.

Sometimes all that matters, short-term, is victory and this was one of those days. Stuart Lancaster, the coach, pointed out that of England’s 26 tries in 2014, 21 had been scored by the backs, but the game told its own story. This was a nuts-and-bolts triumph.

England had identified Australia’s weakness in Ireland last week - it was hardly the best-kept secret - and had ruthlessly exploited it. ‘If you can go through the middle, why do you need to go wide?’ Lancaster asked, and he is right.

England powered through the heart of Australia’s defence and there is every likelihood the same tactic will work on October 3 next year. Its wider worth remains to be seen.

To win the tournament - and that has to be England’s aim as hosts - is likely to require more and even floundering Australia had the better backs on Saturday, as usual.

Certainly, England have no equivalent of Israel Folau. Yet after being humbled by South Africa, Brian Ashton went back to basics at the World Cup in 2007 and England became unlikely finalists. It is perhaps no coincidence, then, that at the end of the game the most animated of England’s coaches was Graham Rowntree, marshal of the forwards.

If England have been taking positives that many neutrals had barely glimpsed through the winter, the one consistent quality has been Rowntree’s group.

Unfortunately England's back are not expansive enough and they do not have a quality star like Folau (left)

The line-out has been consistent, the scrum solid and there will be those who argue that England should continue playing to these strengths and damn the critics. Right now, it would be foolish to pretend England’s backs are a match for the very best: not on the showing this autumn.

So to Cardiff, for the opening Six Nations game on Friday, February 6. To say it will be a lively encounter rather underplays the mood and significance. Wales are also World Cup group opponents but few are calling this a must-win game - maybe because it is thought unlikely that England will deliver on the demand.

And that puts Saturday’s game into the sharpest perspective. It was a necessary step, an important step, but with limitations. Not least because what England are best at, Wales are, too; plus several others.
