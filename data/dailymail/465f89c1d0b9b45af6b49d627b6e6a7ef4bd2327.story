In his map, A History of Residential Contruction in the USA, scientist Seth Kadish has tracked the building of houses around the country from pre-1930s to now.

The maps uses shades of purple and yellow to show when the most houses were built in a given county.

The map shows that vast swathes of the country's homes in the West and Southeast were built in the 1900s, and even more in the Northeast and Midwest were built in the 1930s or before.

Visual statistics: In the pale yellow counties, more homes were built pre-1930s than in any other period, and the darker counties have mostly modern structures

There are only two counties in the whole country in which houses from the 1940 predominate, Anderson County, Tennessee, and Cottle County, Texas.

Three counties have predominantly homes built from 2005 to 2013: Cameron Parish, Louisiana, Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana and Hancock COunty, Mississippi.

Plaquemines Parish was one of three Louisiana towns most heavily hit by Hurricane Katrina, which explains its plurality of new homes.

Hancock County was also severely struck.

Cameron Parish was similarly decimated by Hurricane Rita in 2005 and Hurricane Ika in 2008.

Seth Kadish says that according to his map, the typical county would have mostly houses built in the 1970s, then an even distribution of pre-1940, 1980s, and 1990s houses, then an even distribution of 1950s, 1960s, and post-2000 houses, and the smallest number of houses from the 1940s.

Kadish said he became interested in the distribution of construction eras after he and his wife moved to Portland Oregan into a house built in 2006.

Previously, the couple had lived in a 1930s condo in Providence, Rhode Island.

Kadish's blog Vizual Statistix is an outlet for his 'passion for data visualization.'

It shows that three towns hit by hurricanes have the most new homes and many parts of the Northeast and Midwest have primarily homes built in the 1930s or before
