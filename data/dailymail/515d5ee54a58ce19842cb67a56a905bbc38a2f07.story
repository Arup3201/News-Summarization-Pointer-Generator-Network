Three pitch invaders arrested after they disrupted a Tottenham Hotspur match last night have been revealed as YouTube stars making films that aim to 'offend and harass the general public'.

Gomes Garcia, Nathan Brown and Dan Jarvis  are the founders  of TrollStation, a controversial prank group with 100,000 subscribers whose videos have been seen by millions worldwide.

Last night all three men ran onto the White Hart Lane pitch during the Europa League match with Partizan Belgrade, and at one point the referee took the teams off the pitch for ten minutes. 

All three men are still in custody after being arrested following the pitch invasion and one of the three men was also arrested for handling stolen goods.

They all wore T-shirts promoting audio manufacturers BassBuds, whose official Tottenham headphones have been pulled down from the club's online  store today.

Trouble: Tottenham's clash was interrupted three times by the pitch invaders, which led the game being temporarily suspended for ten minutes

Action: Spurs midfielder Mousa Dembele attempts to stop Jarvis, with the trio wearing 'BassBuds' t-shirts, and police confirmed no action we be taken against the players who tacked them

The gang's previous stunts include turning a Tube carriage into a strip club, faking a kidnapping and one film where a black man is kept as a slave and whipped in the street. 

Message: Two days ago one of the group's founders tweeted this picture holding a picture of Nathan Brown holding a YouTube award

One member also pretended to take cocaine in public places and another confronted comedian Russell Brand at a 'People Before Profit' rally he organised. 

Police have also been called to speak to them on a number of occasions. 

Before their latest prank at Spurs, Garcia, Brown and Jarvis filmed themselves boasting about how they would disrupt the match and also chanted 'Yid Army' - a controversial phrase linked to Spurs' Jewish support which some consider anti-Semitic.

The trio ran on to the pitch during the first-half of the Europa League match, attempting to take selfies with the Tottenham players and evading stewards who tried to catch them.

After the third pitch invasion, referee Yevgen Aranovsky led the players into the tunnel for several minutes on safety grounds.

BassBuds issued a statement via Facebook condemning their actions, adding: 'We are appalled that the game was interrupted in this manner. We do not condone the interruption of any sporting fixture in this way.'

Despite this, Spurs severed links with the company after the stunt and could well take legal action if they are found to have links to it.

UEFA confirmed on Friday afternoon that they have opened disciplinary proceedings against Tottenham. 

A tweet by the Metropolitan Police confirmed the arrest of the three pitch invaders - they added that one of the three was also arrested for handling stolen goods

Upset: Roberto Soldado did not take kindly to the second pitch invader Garcia, ripping his shirt off in anger

BassBuds, a sponsor linked with Spurs, denied they had anything to do with the incident

Garcia was one of the pranksters disrupting a Russell Brand monologue earlier this month

TrollStation also posted a video on their YouTube where they set up a 'strip club' on the London Underground

Brown runs gleefully onto the pitch displaying the BassBuds logo on his top

The TrollStation video, uploaded to YouTube late on Thursday night, starts with Gomes introducing the prank and his fellow pitch invaders 'Nathan' and 'Jarvis'.

He says: 'Today we're going to see who lasts longer on the pitch.'

The three pitch invasions are then filmed from the stands, in breach of the ticket terms.

Nathan is the first to run on to the pitch, making his way past Jan Vertonghen before stopping to pose for a selfie with a frustrated Kyle Naughton.

He then runs past Benjamin Stambouli before  the orange-vested stewards catch him as the crowd egg him on.

'Trollstation is a collective of social misfits playing mad ASBO games on the public.'

Gomes is the second prankster to run on to the field, evading security all too easily. He has his shirt pulled off by Roberto Soldado but continues bare-chested before being dragged to the ground by stewards.

Dan Jarvis, the third to run on, sends a steward flying as he climbs over the sponsor boards but is wrestled to the ground by Mousa Dembele. It is at this point the referee leads the players off.

In a statement published on their website, Tottenham confirmed: 'Three pitch invaders at tonight's match have been arrested and are assisting police with their enquiries.

'We apologise to fans for the disruptions caused by this totally unacceptable behaviour.'

YouTube are also considering their response, MailOnline understands. 

The match, which eventually finish 1-0 to the hosts, was suspended after the events

One of the men who ran onto the pitch was tweeting about it on Wednesday evening

'Tonight my cojones will be put to the test,' he wrote, hours before disrupting the game at White Hart Lane

The match resumed after a short delay and Tottenham won 1-0, sealing their passage to the knockout stage of the competition.

The TrollStation Twitter account posted about the prank on Friday morning, calling for the trio to be released from custody.

The Metropolitan Police confirmed to Sportsmail that the three men were arrested at the match and remained in custody.

Another tweet suggested a repeat performance, saying: 'The questions is Emirates Stadium or Stamford Bridge?'

They had hinted a prank was imminent ahead of the event, with Gomes Garcia tweeting on Thursday afternoon: 'Tonight my cojones will be put to the test.'

They even apologised to BassBuds in one tweet afterwards, saying they 'had to do it... we support Arsenal'. 

The trio have gained a large online following for their pranks, racking up thousands of YouTube views.

BassBuds sell official Tottenham merchandise, but the club have deleted products from their club shop

TrollStation were tweeting before the events, saying they were Arsenal fans, and 'planning' their next venture

Mousa Dembele tackles Jarvis to the floor as he sprinted onto the White Hart Lane pitch

A prank last month, which saw them seal off part of a London Underground carriage as a strip dancing club, attracted over 200,000 views on YouTube. 

Free lap dances were offered to passangers travelling on a Northern Line train through central London with the 'strip club' coming complete with bouncers and a velvet rope.

Another prank saw Nathan dancing wildly to techno track 'Sandstorm' by Darude on an Underground platform as unimpressed commuters watched on in bemusement.

They also ambushed Russell Brand at one of his recent protests and hid in the changing rooms at a Kent leisure centre so they could ride the flumes after it closed.

They also faked kidnappings in a supermarket, a mobile phone shop and a bus stop, complete with 'gangsters' in black balaclavas and hoodies, who bundled the 'victim' into the boot of a car. 

Dan Jarvis posted a video on his Facebook page after staying in a leisure centre after hours last month
