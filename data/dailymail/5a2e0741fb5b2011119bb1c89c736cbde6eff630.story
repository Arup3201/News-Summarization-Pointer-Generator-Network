A new documentary explores the ever-enduring fashion sense of a group of age-defying women in their seventies, eighties and nineties.

Based on photographer Ari Seth Cohen's blog and book of the same name, Advanced Style features women like 81-year-old New York boutique owner Lynn Dell Cohen, who takes pride in her unique fashion sense and ubiquitous glamour.

'I'm dressed up for the theatre of my life every day,' she says in a trailer for the film, striking a pose in bejeweled tortoiseshell sunglasses, a leopard print hat and matching earrings. 'I get such a kick out of it!'

Forever young: A new documentary called Advanced Style explores the ever-enduring fashion sense of a group of age-defying women in their seventies, eighties and nineties in New York

Fun-loving: Inspired by photographer Ari Seth Cohen's blog, the film features boutique owner Lynn Dell Cohen, 81 (pictured). 'I'm dressed up for the theatre of my life every day,' she says. 'I get such a kick out of it!'

Another woman in the film looks in the mirror as she puts on a layered pearl necklace, explaining: 'I never wanted to look young - I wanted to look great!'

The movie, which is directed by Lina Plioplyte, has already been released in the U.S. and will hit UK theatres on Friday.

According to a description, it 'paints intimate and colorful portraits of independent, stylish women aged 62 to 95 who are challenging conventional ideas about beauty, aging, and Western culture's increasing obsession with youth.'

One such woman is Tziporah Salamon, 63, who wears many different hats as a stylist, performance artist, model and design teacher at Parsons.

'I take it to the Nth degree,' Ms Salamon says in the clip, sitting in an armchair in a white floral fascinator and pearl necklace. 'Most people don't.'

Perfectly poised: Another vivacious star is Harlem-born 83-year-old Jacquie Tajah Murdock, who was tapped by Lanvin to model in the label's fall/winter campaign in 2012, during shooting of the film

Fiery-haired Ilona Royce Smithkin, 94, is a performer as well as an acclaimed artist born in Poland.

'There is no time-limit to anything,' she says in the trailer while applying bright orange eyelashes to match her distinctive locks. 'When you look good, you look good.'

Forever in fashion: The film also features the late socialite Zelda Kaplan (pictured), who passed away in 2012 at the age of 95 after collapsing on the front row of a New York Fashion Week show

Inspiration: Devoted 'to capturing the sartorial savvy of the senior set', 30-year-old Mr Cohen was initially inspired to launch the blog - which was turned into a book - by his own grandmother's personal style

After failing to land any high-profile modelling jobs in her youth, Ms Murdock became a dancer and performed at Harlem's famed Apollo Theatre.

'What a fabulous way to die - doing exactly what she loved to do, which is be out in public, be where itâ€™s happening,' Ms Salamon told New York Magazine.

'Certainly it was happening at the tents during Fashion Week - looking great, being part of the world, being part of life.'

Streetstyle: Tziporah Salamon, 63, is a stylist, performance artist, model and design teacher at Parsons. 'I take it to the Nth degree [when it comes to fashion],' Ms Salamon says in the clip. 'Most people don't'

Positive outlook: 'I never wanted to look young,' one star says of her fashion ethos. 'I wanted to look great!'

Mr Cohen launched his photography blog in 2009, shortly after he first arrived in the city.

'There is no time-limit to anything. When you look good, you look good'

Devoted 'to capturing the sartorial 
savvy of the senior set', the 30-year-old was initially inspired by his 
own grandmother's personal style.

He told Stylecaster: 'I was best friends with my grandmother growing up, and was always inspired by her energy and wisdom.

'I wanted to show that creativity, style, and vitality advance with age, and hopefully help change people's ideas about getting older.'
