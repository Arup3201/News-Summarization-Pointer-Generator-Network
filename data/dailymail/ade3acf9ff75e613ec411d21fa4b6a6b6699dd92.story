A former Royal Navy recruit who dreamed of becoming a master seaman was found hanged weeks after police told her they were dropping a probe into alleged sexual abuse she suffered as a child.

Leya Keating, 21, who was raised by adoptive parents before moving to Portsmouth, told police in 2012 that she had been abused by her biological father and his partner after suffering flashbacks.

She was sectioned in December that year after trying to commit suicide, and made several more attempts on her life until April 2014, when police said they were dropping their investigation.

She discharged herself from the hospital where she was staying in the morning of May 31 last year, and her body was found near train tracks on Hayling Island, Hampshire, at around midday.

Dog walker Simon Lown told the inquest into her death: 'Something caught my eye. It was a bright pink hoody about 50 metres away. 

'You often see children playing in that area and at first I thought she was playing hide and seek. As I walked past I saw the person was not moving at all and I thought something was not right.

'I shouted at her, "is everything alright?" and I got no response.'

An inquest at South Hampshire Coroner's Court (pictured), heard that Miss Keating attempted to kill herself 37 times until April 2014, when police dropped their probe into her claims. She was found dead in May

Paramedics were called, but she was pronounced dead at the scene. Speaking to Leya's adoptive parents, Mr Lown added: 'I am only sorry I did not find her sooner.'

The inquest, taking place in Portsmouth, heard that Miss Keating had four siblings who used to live in Huddersfield.

Miss Keating's birth mother, Marie Sharpe, told the coroner that her marriage to Miss Keating's biological father broke down after he became violent.

She said: 'We lived for many years as a family unit but my marriage broke down due to violence.

'It ended up with me being hospitalised on a weekly basis. The situation escalated and I lost my children, which to this day I regret.'

However Miss Keating remained in contact with her birth father, and alleges that it was during this time she was sexually abused by him and his new partner.

She was taken into care, and in 2002 was sent to live with her adoptive parents, Thomas and Louise Keating, who described her as a 'boisterous, wonderful girl.'

Mr Keating said: 'We adopted Leya and her sister. They were wonderful children. Leya was super fit, she loved to play football with the lads, she was boisterous and extremely good at sport.

'She qualified as a kayaking instructor aged 14. Sometimes she was hard work but she had a BTech in sport from college.

'When she was 16 she started talking about joining the police force. We went to a talk and someone did a speech about the Navy. 

'Leya said she thought that was more suited to her, she loved boats and sailing and wanted to be a master seaman.'

Miss Keating then joined the Navy in 2010 and left home for Plymouth before moving to Portsmouth after her passing-out parade in 2011.

However in 2012 he life began to unravel after she confessed to her adoptive family that she had suffered sexual abuse as a child when she began suffering flashbacks.

Just months later she was sexually assaulted while in the sick bay of a Royal Navy base by a fellow patient, who was subsequently jailed.

She also phoned her adoptive mother that same year and told her she had been discharged from the Navy after injuring her foot.

Mr Keating said: 'She had a boyfriend in Portsmouth and wanted to make a new start for herself. 

'Maybe she felt she had let us down and could not move back. Her life seemed to be getting more and more chaotic.'

Her historic allegations of abuse were reported to police in July 2012, but in December she tried to kill herself for the first time.

Detective Sergeant Simon Clacey, of Hampshire Police, said: 'There were 37 reports to the police between April 2013 and April 2014. 

'She attempted to take her own life on numerous occasions, she took overdoses, threatened to jump off bridges and walked into the path of moving cars and trains.'

Miss Keating had been in contact with birth mother Marie Sharpe since 2010, and in 2013 she messaged Ms Sharpe to say she had been sectioned.

She added: 'Things seemed to escalate quite rapidly from that point. 

'I got a phone call one evening saying she was on Portsmouth Bridge and she was saying goodbye to me, saying she was having flashbacks. I managed to talk her down.' 

In April 2014, Miss Keating was told police would not be taking any further action over the sexual abuse she was said to have suffered as a child. 

Det. Sgt. Clacey told the inquest: 'That wasn’t because she wasn’t believed, but because there was no corroborating evidence.'

At the time of her death, the 21-year-old was a patient at a psychiatric hospital but was allowed out alone for a few hours to get some fresh air. 

Nicholas Edmonds, a nurse at Elmleigh Hospital in Havant, said in a statement read to the inquest: 'Leya had an emotionally unstable personality disorder.

'On May 31, I gave her medication for anxiety and she asked for a self-discharge form. 

'She told me nothing was working for her and it was pointless her being in hospital, but she expressed no suicidal thoughts to me.

'Because she had expressed no suicidal thoughts, it was agreed she could leave.'

The inquest heard Leya was told to keep her phone with her but she ignored calls from the hospital.

Sonny Ogundele, who had worked as a mental health nurse at the hospital since 2007, told the inquest Leya had been a patient from February 2014 up until her death three months later.

He said: 'On April 10, Leah was expressing thoughts to self-discharge. She was let out into the garden but she ended up on the roof. 

'She moved across the roof to the front of the hospital and started threatening to jump off.

'I was trying to talk her out of jumping. She had put a ligature around her neck and staff went up there with the fire brigade.

'This was a reaction to being restricted. She improved with more leave. She was taken off the section and transferred to an open ward.

'She went out on her own several times without any problems.

'On May 31, Nick was doing the meds and he told me that Leya was getting agitated. He talked to her and told me she was asking for a self-discharge form.

'She wanted to go out and get fresh air, which she had done several times before. We discussed our previous knowledge and experience of Leya and what we had done for her in the past. 

'She was still positive about the progress she was making.'

The inquest heard she had self-harmed in the early hours of the morning she was allowed out.

Mr Ogundele said: 'If we keep her in, she becomes more agitated. It is about being restricted. When she left, she was not agitated. Mr Edmonds has carried out risk assessments several times.'

South East Hampshire coroner David Horsley asked: 'He came and discussed it with you and you left him it to him as he had done it before'

Mr Ogundele replied: 'Yes.'

A statement from psychiatrist Dr Zaid Alabassi, said Leya had been diagnosed with an emotionally unstable personality disorder when she was aged 19.

She claimed she was sexually assaulted by her biological father and his partner, and was also sexually assaulted by a man while in the sick bay during her time at the Royal Navy.

The statement read: 'Leya’s illness is characterised by repeat acts and threats of self-harm.

'She was discharged from the Navy on medical grounds. When she was in the sick bay, she was attacked by a fellow patient who went to prison.

'Her personality disorder arose from her traumatic upbringing.'

Consultant psychiatrist Dr James Mcintyre was asked by Mr Horsley: 'Do you think if she had lived, there was a chance of recovery?'

Dr Mcintyre replied: 'She had a lot of strength and was a likeable person. 

'She had powerful emotions. When her frame of mind was not focused on activities she enjoyed, she could go to a negative place. I think the second sexual assault destabilised things for her.'

The inquest was adjourned until tomorrow.
