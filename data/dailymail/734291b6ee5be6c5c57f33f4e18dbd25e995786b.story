Nurse Trevor Madziwa, 34, has been struck off after the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard he was violent to a former patient and held her captive for three hours

A male nurse who had an affair with a former patient before turning violent and holding her captive when she tried to break it off has been struck off.

Trevor Madziwa, 34, who met the young woman when he was working at the Priory Clinic in north London, jabbed his thumbs into her eyes and grabbed her around the neck when she tried to leave his flat, a tribunal heard.

He pinned the 18-year-old down, took her shoes, handbag and phone, and pulled her tights off during the attack, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) heard.

The victim feared he was going to strangle her or throw her over the balcony of his flat, and only managed to escape when she kicked Madziwa and grabbed a knife from the kitchen.

The NMC tribunal heard that Zimbabwean-born Madziwa had admitted having sex with the woman after sending her Facebook messages when she was transferred from the Priory to another hospital.

The young woman, who had a medical history of depression, bulimia and diabetes, had been admitted to the clinic in Southgate where singer Amy Winehouse was once treated, in 2008, the NMC heard.

Eight months later she was transferred to another hospital and some time after that, Madziwa began bombarding her with texts, emails and Facebook messages.

The panel heard that the pair met in hotels for sex sessions before the relationship began to deteriorate over several months.  It culminated in the incident at Madziwa's flat on November 20, 2011.

The NMC hearing was told that the teenager reported the incident to the police but ultimately decided she did not want to press charges.

Maurice Cohen, chairman of the panel, said: 'The fact the police took the allegation against Mr Madziwa seriously is noted.'

Madziwa, who had already admitted having a sexual relationship with his former patient and preventing her from leaving his flat, later claimed that the woman hacked into his email account to fire off a series of aggressive messages to herself.

But Mr Cohen dubbed Madziwa's evidence 'implausible' and 'contradictory' as the NMC misconduct panel found him guilty of verbally and physically abusing the woman while holding her captive.

Mr Cohen said: 'Mr Madziwa displayed verbally and physically abusive behaviour towards [the alleged victim] and a sanction is needed to meet the public interest.

'It was a serious departure from the relevant standards as set out in the code.

'There is no evidence he has considered the consequences of his actions on [the young woman] or on the profession.

'The panel finds Mr Madziwa has a harmful and deep seated attitudinal problem.  His actions amounted to abuse of his position and power - this was not an isolated incident but occurred over a protracted period of time.

'The panel finds Mr Madziwa's behaviour breaks fundamental tenets of the profession.  A striking-off order is the only sanction that would satisfy the public interest.'
