Two elderly women accused of sorcery were saved by police just as a mob were about to set them on fire in rural Papua New Guinea.

Police came just in the nick of time 
as the angry lynch mob had strapped the two women to poles and were 
ready to burn them over the alleged murder of an eight-year-old girl.

The attack took place in the same town
where 20-year-old Kepari Leniata was stripped, beaten and burned to 
death, accused of being a witch.

Police in Mount Hagen in the Papua New
Guinean highlands, were able to safely remove the two elderly women 
from the crowd which was about to lynch them for being ‘sorcerers’.

It is believed the murdered eight-year-old was 
‘gang raped and killed by two known suspects,’ police commander Teddy 
Tei said, adding that the suspects were among the mob accusing the women
of being witches.

A holy man, known as a ‘glassman’ for 
having supernatural powers, had claimed the women were responsible for 
the child’s death and accused them of sorcery.

About 20 people were arrested, The Telegraph reported.

The event took place a week after a 
mother-of-two was tossed on to a pyre of tyres and burned alive, after 
being accused of killing a neighbour's six-year-old son with sorcery.

Still alive: Sorcery and witchcraft are still practiced in remote villages in Papua New Guinea's highlands

Kepari Leniata, 20, 'confessed' after she was dragged from her hut, stripped naked and tortured with hot iron rods.

She
was then dragged to a local rubbish dump, doused in petrol and, with 
hands and feet bound, thrown on a fire of burning tyres.

Papua New Guinean police have launched a murder 
investigation and are reportedly preparing charges against those 
responsible.

Authorities and international diplomats have spoken out against the torching of the young mother, including the country's Prime Minister Peter O'Neill who addressed the matter in a statement over Miss Leniata's murder last week.

‘No one commits such a despicable act in the society that all of us, including Kepari, belong to,' he said.

‘Barbaric
killings connected with alleged sorcery. Violence against women because
of this belief that sorcery kills. These are becoming all too common in
certain parts of the country.

'It
is reprehensible that women, the old and the weak in our society should
be targeted for alleged sorcery or wrongs that they actually have 
nothing to do with.’

Part of the culture: Sorcery and witchcraft is widely believed in Papua New Guinea, which brought in a Sorcery Act to protect against attacks on those accused of practising black magic (file picture)

The two shocking events took place in the highlands of Papua New Guinea where many believe that witchcraft exists, and sorcery is used to kill enemies.

The cost of a witch doctor revealing a
cause of death or casting out an evil spirit is usually 1000 New 
Guinean kina (£303), plus a pig and a bag of rice,

In 1971, whilst still a colony, the country introduced a Sorcery Act to criminalise the practice, however the law has recently seen a rise in attacks on innocent people accused 
of black magic and convictions by 
‘kangaroo courts’ made up of of local village elders.

Last
July, 29 people were arrested accused of black magic and cannibalism 
after allegedly murdering seven people in order to eat their brains and 
use their genitals for sorcery rituals.

In 2009 a man was hacked to pieces by machetes after a ‘kangaroo court’ convicted him of sorcery.
