South Africa coach Heyneke Meyer has named five uncapped players in a 36-man squad for the Springboks' European tour.

The group contains 29 players involved in this year's Rugby Championship, plus newcomers Robbie Coetzee, Julian Redelinghuys, Nizaam Carr, Jaco Kriel and Seabelo Senatla, while Coenie Oosthuizen and Johan Goosen both earn recalls.

South Africa launch their tour against Ireland in Dublin on November 8, which is followed by appointments with England, Italy and Wales.

'It's wonderful to have this kind of continuity in selection, while the five uncapped players in the squad have all been rewarded for superb form throughout the season,' Meyer told www.sarugby.net.

'Many of the selected players were at our training camp in Stellenbosch last week, where we put in a lot of very hard work. We will have to hit the ground running when we assemble in Johannesburg on Wednesday before we depart on what will be a challenging tour.'

Players not considered for the trip due to injury include Saracens hooker Schalk Brits, Bath flanker Francois Louw and scrum-half Fourie du Preez.

Ulster scrum-half Ruan Pienaar's involvement, meanwhile, will depend on a fitness test in Dublin next week. Pienaar suffered knee ligament damage during South Africa's Rugby Championship clash against New Zealand last month.

The Springboks have confirmed that none of their overseas-based players will be available to face Wales on November 29 as that game falls outside the International Rugby Board's autumn Test window.

It means South Africa will tackle Wales without the likes of wing Bryan Habana, fly-half Morne Steyn, prop Gurthro Steenkamp and lock Bakkies Botha, who all play club rugby in France.

Squad: B Botha, S Burger, N Carr, M Coetzee, R Coetzee, D De Allende, L de Jager, J de Villiers (capt), B du Plessis, J du Plessis, E Etzebeth, J Goosen, B Habana, C Hendricks, F Hougaard, J Kriel, P Lambie, W le Roux, V Matfield, T Mohoje, T Mtawarira, L Mvovo, T Nyakane, C Oosthuizen, R Pienaar, J P Pietersen, H Pollard, J Redelinghuys, C Reinach, S Senatla, J Serfontein, G Steenkamp, M Steyn, A Strauss, D Vermeulen, W Whiteley.
