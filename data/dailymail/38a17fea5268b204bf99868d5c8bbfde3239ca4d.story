Police who patrol school grounds in the Los Angeles suburb of Compton are to be given semi-automatic rifles to help deal with firearms incidents.

The move - revealed as children prepared to return after the summer holidays on Monday - came after officers said they needed to better equipped to deal with attackers who are increasingly well-armed.

In several recent US school shootings, suspects have been armed with high-powered guns and protected by body armor, and officers also cited the prospect of a terrorist attack.

Officers in Compton will now be able to call upon an AR-15 semi-automatic assault rifle, which would allow them to penetrate a suspect's body armor and target them from further away than with handguns.

But residents in Compton - which has long been associated with gang and gun culture - claimed the move was unnecessary, and added that police had never had to shoot anyone on a school campus before.

The local school board, which has responsibility for 26,000 students in the south LA suburb, has allowed specially selected officers to carry the AR-15s in the back of their cars after undergoing training.

William Wu, Compton police chief, told the school board in a meeting last month: 'This is our objective: save lives.

There have been at least 74 school shootings since the Sandy Hook massacre, in which 26 people died

'Handguns you'd be lucky to hit accurately at 25 yards. With a rifle in the hands of a trained person, you can be go 50, 100 yards accurately.'

Some students and parents, who have previously accused school police in Compton of racial profiling, expressed concern over the switch to more powerful weapons on school grounds.

'The school police has been very notorious in the community and in reality has never had to shoot anyone before,' said Francisco Orozco, a recent Dominguez High School graduate and founder of the Compton Democratic Club, told KPCC. 

'So this escalation of weapons we feel is very unnecessary.

'The school police has not even earned the right to carry handguns.' 

According to Mr Wu, several other US school districts in California, Florida, Utah and Kansas already have police armed with semi-automatic weapons.

He said: 'These rifles give us greater flexibility in dealing with a person with bad intent who comes onto any of our campuses.'

Ladd Everitt, spokesman for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, said the development was 'deeply disturbing'.

He told Fox News: 'There is no other free nation in the world that would even consider this.'

According to The Washington Post, there have been at least 74 school shootings since the deadly Sandy Hook massacre of December 2012.

Although Compton - which has a population of 100,000 - has a global reputation for violence, the murder rate has dropped dramatically in recent years.

It is ranked as LA's 11th 'most deadly neighborhood'  over the past 12 months, according to the Los Angeles Times. 

It ranks high in both violent crime and property crime rates, with gunshots being the most common cause of death.

The national debate over racial profiling by police has been reignited recently by the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. 

When violent riots erupted in the city, the local police departments responded with armored vehicles, SWAT units and military-grade armors in the following days.
