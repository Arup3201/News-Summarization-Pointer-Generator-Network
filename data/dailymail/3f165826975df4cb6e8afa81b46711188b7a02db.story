Chris Froome has abandoned the 2014 Tour de France after the Team Sky leader crashed for the third time in two days.

The defending champion had a precautionary X-ray on his wrist following a crash on Tuesday's fourth stage and took another tumble on the route from Ypres to Arenburg Porte du Hinaut.

Froome's injures proved too severe for the 29-year-old to continue after a discussion with Team Doctor Alan Farrell, as the battered and bruised cyclist looked in pain getting into Team Sky's car.

Froome fell about 30km into the stage, 
before going down again with 69km to go, making it three nasty 
falls in the space of 24 hours.

He got back to his feet, holding his right arm, and tried to get back on the bike, but abandoned the Tour after speaking with Farrell and Sports Director Nicolas Portal.

Stage five is recognised as among the most dangerous days in the schedule, particularly given the rain-soaked conditions on Wednesday.

The stage commemorates 100 years 
since the start of World War One and features many of the cobbles used 
in the Paris-Roubaix one-day race 'the Hell of the North'.

The wet weather forced race organisers to remove two of the nine cobbled sections, too, but Froome's falls came prior to
 the first section of cobbles he had been dreading since the route was 
announced last autumn.

The sad sight of Froome, dominant in 
winning the 2013 Tour, grimacing by the roadside was reminiscent of Sir 
Bradley Wiggins' abandonment with a broken collarbone in the first week 
of the 2011 Tour.
