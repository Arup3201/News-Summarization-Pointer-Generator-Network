British soldiers face new criminal prosecutions over the death of a hotel receptionist in Iraq.

Investigators examining claims that UK troops abused and murdered innocent civilians have identified fresh lines of inquiry linked to the case of Baha Mousa which could lead to new charges.

Only one serviceman has ever been convicted over Mr Mousa’s death.

Corporal Donald Payne became the first member of the Armed Forces to be convicted of a war crime after he pleaded guilty to inhumanely treating civilians. He was jailed for one year and dismissed from the Army.

But the issue is set to rumble on for at least another three years, even though ten years have elapsed since Mr Mousa was killed and more than £50million of taxpayers’ money has been earmarked for trials and a public inquiry.

Despite the seriousness of an episode which heaped shame on the Army, critics will question whether reopening the case is a justified use of the cash-strapped Ministry of Defence’s time and resources.

After trawling through thousands of documents and other pieces of evidence connected to the case, the Iraq Historic Allegations Team said yesterday that it wanted to speak to ‘several’ soldiers.

The development paves the way for current and former British service personnel to be hauled before the courts for another trial. Some could face a retrial after being cleared at an earlier court martial.

The IHAT investigation is part of an 
inquiry set to cost £35million and last until the end of 2016. It is 
examining claims of abuses in Iraq by UK forces personnel from 2003 to 
July 2009.

Mr Mousa, 26, an innocent hotel receptionist, died after being seized by UK forces during a raid on suspected insurgents in Basra, southern Iraq, in September 2003.

They wrongly believed the father of two was a terrorist involved in the murder of four of their colleagues.

He was taken to Darul Dhyafa military base for questioning where he was so badly beaten he collapsed after sustaining 93 injuries, including fractured ribs and a broken nose.

In September 2011, a public inquiry found Mr Mousa and nine other detainees suffered ‘an appalling episode of serious gratuitous violence’ by members of 1st Battalion the Queen’s Lancashire Regiment (1QLR).

The inquiry, led by Sir William Gage, named 19 soldiers said to have assaulted detainees.

Survivors claimed they endured humiliating mistreatment and brutality, including interrogation techniques banned by the Government.

At a court martial in 2006-07, seven soldiers from 1QLR, including its former commanding officer, Colonel Jorge Mendonca, faced charges relating to the killing of Mr Mousa and to the other detainees. But the £20million trial ended with all being cleared apart from Corporal Payne.

GP Derek Keilloh was struck off for failing to report details of the war crime while working as a young Army medic in Iraq.

The MoD has paid £2.83million in compensation to the families of Mr Mousa and nine other Iraqi men abused by British soldiers.
