Buzz Aldrin has backed plans for a one way trip to Mars, claiming the first visitors should remain on the red planet until they die.

During a Reddit AMA he told users the first visitors should build up a permanent settlement on Mars.

He also admitted he struggles to deal with people who say the moon landings were fake - and admitted he loved his time on the lunar surface.

Buzz Aldrin, the lunar module pilot, walking on the surface of the Moon near the leg of the Lunar Module (LM) "Eagle" during the Apollo 11 extravehicular activity (EVA). He said that missions to Mars should be one way, and lead to a permanent colony being set up.

'My first words of my impression of being on the surface of the Moon that just came to my mind was 'Magnificent desolation.'

The magnificence of human beings, humanity, Planet Earth, maturing the technologies, imagination and courage to expand our capabilities beyond the next ocean, to dream about being on the Moon, and then taking advantage of increases in technology and carrying out that dream - achieving that is magnificent testimony to humanity.

But it is also desolate - there is no place on earth as desolate as what I was viewing in those first moments on the Lunar Surface.

Because I realized what I was looking at, towards the horizon and in every direction, had not changed in hundreds, thousands of years.

Beyond me I could see the moon curving away - no atmosphere, black sky.

Cold. Colder than anyone could experience on Earth when the sun is up- but when the sun is up for 14 days, it gets very, very hot. No sign of life whatsoever.

That is desolate.

More desolate than any place on Earth.

'There is very little doubt, in my mind, that what the next monumental achievement of humanity will be the first landing by an Earthling, a human being, on the planet Mars,' he said.

'And I expect that within 2 decades of the 5th anniversary of the first landing on the moon, that within 2 decades America will lead an international presence on Planet Mars.

'I have considered whether a landing on Mars could be done by the private sector,' he said during the discussion to promote the 45th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, which is on 20 July.

'It conflicts with my very strong idea, concept, conviction, that the first human beings to land on Mars should not come back to Earth.

'They should be the beginning of a build-up of a colony / settlement, I call it a 'permanence'.

He also hit back at claims it would be a suicide mission.

'A settlement you can visit once or twice, come back, and then decide you want to settle.

'Same with a colony.

'But you want it to be permanent from the get-go, from the very first.

I know that many people don't feel that that should be done.

'Some people even consider it distinctly a suicide mission. Not me! Not at all.

'Because we will plan, we will construct from the moon of Mars, over a period of six to seven years, the landing of different objects at the landing site that will be brought together to form a complete Mars habitat and laboratory, similar to what has been done at the moon.'

He also hit out at firms offering what he claims amount to tourist trips.

'Tourism trips to Mars and back are just not the appropriate way for human beings from Earth – to have an individual company, no matter how smart, send people to mars and bring them back, it is very very expensive. It delays the obtaining of permanence, internationally.'

Aldrin also admitted he didn't waste time listening to people who said the moon landings were faked

Aldrin was also asked about conspiracy theorists who say the moon landings were faked.

'I personally don't waste very much of my time on what is so obvious to a really thinking person, of all the evidence – we talked about Carl Sagan recently, who made a very prophetic observation.

'He said that 'extraordinary observations require extraordinary evidence to make them believable.'

There is not extraordinary evidence of (as far as I know) all the claims that have been made that we did not go to the moon.'

He also said he believed alien life exists.

'There may be aliens in our Milky Way galaxy, and there are billions of other galaxies.

'The probability is almost CERTAIN that there is life somewhere in space.

'It was not that remarkable, that special, that unusual, that life here on earth evolved gradually, slowly, to where we are today.'

He also hit out at calls for Nasa to return to the moon

'Returning to the Moon with Nasa astronauts is not the best usage of our resources.

Because OUR resources should be directed to outward, beyond-the-moon, to establishing habitation and laboratories on the surface of Mars that can be built, assembled, from the close-by moons of Mars.

'With very little time delay - a second or less.

'Much better than controlling things on the Moon from the Earth. So when NASA funding comes up for review, please call your lawmakers to support it.'

Gravity (2013), starring Sandra Bullock as Ryan Stone.

'I thought that the movie Gravity, the depiction of people moving around in zero gravity, was really the best I have seen.

'The free-falling, the actions that took place between two people, were very, I think, exaggerated, but probably bent the laws of physics.

'But to a person who's been in space, we would cringe looking at something that we hoped would NEVER, EVER Happen.

'It's very thrilling for the person who's never been there, because it portrays the hazards, the dangers that could come about if things begin to go wrong, and I think that as I came out of that movie, I said to myself and others, 'Sandra Bullock deserves an Oscar.'

Aldrin was also asked how the decision was made on who would walk on the moon first.

'I felt that there was an obligation on my part to put forth the reasons why a commander who had been burdened down with an enormous amount of responsibility and training for activities (and because of that, in all previous missions, if someone, a crew member, was to spacewalk, it was always the junior person, not the space commander who would stay inside).

We knew this would be different because 2 people would be going out.

Buzz Aldrin, the second man to land on the moon, celebrated communion on the heavenly orb

'There was a group at Nasa who felt the junior person (me) should go out first, but many people felt the great symbology of the commander from past expeditions or arrivals at a destination.

'The decision that was made was absolutely correct as far as who went out first, symbolically.

However who was in charge of the what happened after both people are outside, I believe, could have been done differently.

'I was not the commander, I was a junior person, so once both were outside, I followed my leader, because we (NASA) had not put together detailed jobs of people outside.

'I believe it could have been improved. But it was very successful for what it was.

'And the decision wasn't up to me, or Neil, it was up to people much higher up in Nasa.'
