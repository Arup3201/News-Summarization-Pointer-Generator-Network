Everton defender Antolin Alcaraz has likened his injury-plagued first season at the club to being in prison.The Paraguay international followed his manager Roberto Martinez from Wigan last summer but did not make his debut until December 29, managing only seven appearances in total.

In his absence the 20-year-old John Stones established himself as a more than capable deputy to Phil Jagielka and Sylvain Distin, both of whom suffered injuries of their own in the second half of the season.

Alcaraz is now looking forward to having a full pre-season and proving his worth.

'On a personal level, it’s one to put behind me,' the centre-back told evertontv.

'It’s one to forget almost as it’s been full of negatives.

'The frustration as a player is that an injury stops you doing what you most enjoy.

'It’s almost like it is taking your liberty away from you and you become a prisoner in your own situation.

'But it’s gone now and it’s not worth looking back and feeling sorry for yourself.

'You have to look ahead, be positive and I’m looking forward to next season and hoping for better things.

'I took solace in is that I was able to play a few games towards the end of the season and physically I came through those okay, and that is promising for next season.

'What I want more than anything is to make sure that I am 100 per cent fit, totally free from injuries and have the chance to do what I do.'
