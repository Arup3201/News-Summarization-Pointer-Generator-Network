A sweet-toothed designer has created a chocoholic's dream - a sofa that looks like a giant chocolate bar.

The tasty-looking leather creation even comes complete with secret hiding places for indulgent snacks.

It has a detachable table that looks like a half-ripped wrapper and the memory foam cushions appear to melt at the touch.

Designer Iris Koser, 27, said: 'I wanted to design a very emotional piece of furniture that appeals to as many senses as possible. Chocolate was the most sensual inspiration I could find.

A chocolate-loving designer has invented every woman's dream: a mouth-watering sofa. The tasty-looking leather creation comes complete with secret hiding places for indulgent snacks

'There is just something about chocolate, it is a kind of sweet temptation that appeals to all the senses.

'And it is perfect for women - it has no calories!

'But I couldn't help putting in secret drawers for chocolate bars. We all need that, don't we?'

After unveiling the piece in her final degree show at Hochschule M|nchen University, Iris was flooded with calls from buyers eager for a glimpse.

Designer Iris Koser, 27, said she wanted to design a very emotional piece of furniture that appeals to as many senses as possible

She modelled the piece on her favourite - milk chocolate - but due to high demand, she has agreed to tweak it to suit each customer's taste.

Iris, who specialises in 'sensual furniture', said: 'I love any kind of chocolate. My favourite is milk chocolate but I also love bitter sweet, or flavoured ones - maybe ginger or chilli, or dried roses.

'Maybe because it makes you happy; maybe because it is so delicious.

'But everyone has their own favourite. I make it into particular brands, play with the form of the cushions, and stamp specific brands in the leather, like on a real bar of chocolate.'
