This is the incredible moment a crafty crab manages to rise to the bait but leave unscathed.

Extraordinary footage has emerged of a blue swimmer crab evading entrapment, opening a pot with its pincers and absconding with a sizeable bite of herring.

The video, captured in Largs Bay Beach in South Australia and uploaded to Facebook this week, has received over 430,000 Views and 2,000 likes.

Builder Mark Katnich decided to drop a GoPro in the crab net while he went crabbing over the weekend, reports The Advertiser.

'It was interesting to see for someone who's been crabbing a bit to see what it's actually like down there,' he said.

'I'm always having a bit of a go at my son for not putting the top on properly, and this time it was me.' 

Mr Katnich said it was the first time he had filmed one of the crab traps, with the footage offering a fresh perspective to one of his favourite hobbies.
