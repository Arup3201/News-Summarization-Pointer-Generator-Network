A celebrity wannabe dubbed 'Britain's vainest man' has revealed he wants to sue the NHS for £25,000 for 'botching' his free nose job. 

Sam Barton, 22, who wants to look like The Only Way is Essex star Joey Essex, has bragged how he will splash the money on a new BMW to help him 'feel much better' about the operation. 

Mr Barton, from Sutton Coldfield, in Birmingham, said he had decided to sue the NHS because of all the negative coverage he had received since his case was highlighted. 

He had received a free  nose job worth £5,000 on the NHS in a bid for the perfect looks.

He said: 'When I initially had the operation done, I wasn't really happy with the result. I thought it looked worse. But my family and friends told me it looked fine.

'But all the negative comments about it do get me down sometimes. Although there are days when I just laugh them off.

'It doesn't look fitting to my face, and is uneven. It is too big and looks terrible.

'The fact that people have made the comments has driven me to sue the NHS. It was pointless having the operation it's a lot to go through for no reason.'

Mr Barton, who claims to be best friends with Benefits Street's White Dee, intends to continue changing his face.

'I don't really feel good about myself. I still want loads of surgery done', he said.

He has spent £20,000 for his teeth, £5,000 on Botox, £2,000 on waxing and £2,500 on tanning treatment

He has also applied for free Botox for life on the NHS and wants an operation to have his ears pinned back.

He has said he needs the free cosmetic treatment to combat the anxiety over his appearance that his 'new-found fame' has provoked. 

In an earlier interview he said: 'Since I was in the newspapers people recognise and stare at me more and it makes me sweat a lot through anxiety.

'I have over 20,000 followers on Twitter and I do get trolled sometimes by some nasty individuals.

'I am very self-conscious about my appearance and I have told the doctors that I need to have regular Botox treatment to keep up my appearance and to make me feel more confident and less self-conscious.'

Mr Barton, who is the grandson of Aston Villa's European Cup winning boss Tony Barton, previously revealed he had spent £55,000 on reconstructive surgery and beauty treatments to turn himself into the 'perfect man'.

But he has amassed hefty credit card debts of £25,000 in just four years in search of the glamorous Joey Essex look he hopes will make him a star.

He has spent £20,000 on treatment for his teeth, around £5,000 on Botox, £2,000 on waxing and £2,500 on tanning treatment.

He has also had a nose job and a procedure to straighten his nose, together worth £10,400, although one was done for free on the NHS.
