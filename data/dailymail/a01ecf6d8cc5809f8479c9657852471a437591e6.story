Those who frequently use the word 'like' in conversation may be more thoughtful, research shows (library image)

It is, like, a really annoying habit.

But don’t be too swift to dismiss those who pepper their conversation with ‘like’.

Because far from being a sign of low intelligence, it may signal thoughtfulness.

Those who frequently use the ‘discourse marker’ may be simply taking time to think about what they are saying, if you know what I mean.

The theory comes from US researchers who analysed recordings made of more than 200 men and women as they took part in conversations in their everyday lives.

The team, from the University of Texas, looked at how often the volunteers used the word ‘like’.

They also counted up mentions of ‘I mean’ and ‘you know’.

So called filled pauses – ‘ums’ and ‘uhs’ were also totted up and the results compared with information about the volunteers’ personalities.

Despite frequent use of ‘like’ often being seen as a sign of empty-headedness, the word was a particular favourite of conscientious types.

The researchers admitted this could be a rogue result.

But, assuming it is reliable, it may be that ‘like’, as well as ‘I mean’ and ‘you know’ are signs of more considered speech.

In other words, footballers who fall back on it in World Cup interviews, and starlets who say it over and over may be more thoughtful than you give them credit for.

The study, published in the Journal of Language and Social Psychology, also found that the three discourse markers were more popular with women than men and with the young than the old.

The researchers said: ‘As people become older, the gender effect disappears.  This may be indicative of normative life transition into adult roles, such as when one graduates from college and enters a job market.

‘A career role change may be a possible factor that leads people to change their use of filler words.’

Similarly ‘ums’ and ‘uhs’ were more common in the young.  However, their use was not linked to gender or to personality, despite their often been seen as a sign of anxiety.

The scientists from the University of Texas anaylsed 200 people's conversation - and found those who used 'like' and other filler words had more considered speech (library image)
