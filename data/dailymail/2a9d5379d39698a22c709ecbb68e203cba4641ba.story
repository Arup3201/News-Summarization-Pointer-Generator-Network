A five-year-old girl has received a confidential multi-million dollar payout from pharmaceutical manufacturer CSL Ltd and the state of Western Australia after becoming severely disabled from a flu vaccination.

Saba Button got the vaccination under a government-promoted scheme in April 2010 when a GP injected a 0.25ml dose of CSL 2010 Fluvax into her left arm.

As a consequence of the vaccination, she suffered hypoxic brain injury and severe disabilities.

Her life expectancy has been significant shortened and she will require constant care for the rest of her life.

Days after she was vaccinated and dozens of other adverse reactions in children were reported, the state government suspended its seasonal flu vaccination program.

The Buttons said the settlement - which media reports suggest was in the order of several million dollars - was a huge relief.

'No one wants to really go through court ... to settle it through mediation is a great relief for us,' father Mick Button told reporters.

He said Saba inspires him every day, and the settlement would provide the family with financial security to meet her needs.

'You can't buy your health but it is a good outcome,' mother Kirsten said.

'Amazingly strong': The Buttons are focusing their attention on their daughter's treatment and are happy to put the settlement behind them

Saba was a toddler when she received a flu shot, which left her with severe disabilities requiring constant life-long care

CSL denied any liability and claiming that the State of Western Australia and the state's health minister were responsible for any compensation due.

CSL also cross-claimed against the state and the minister for a contribution in the event its defence were to fail.

The state and the minister filed a defence to the cross claim denying any liability in the matter.

The claim and cross claim were privately mediated, resulting in all of the parties reaching a settlement.

On Friday, Federal Court of Australia Justice Michael Barker approved the agreement.

Fluvax is now banned in children aged under five years and hundreds of other adverse reactions were experienced by children days after Saba was vaccinated
