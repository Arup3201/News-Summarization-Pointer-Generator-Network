An Australian jihadist who posed with decapitated heads on Twitter appears to now be giving advice on how to access deadly explosives in Sydney.

Mohamed Elomar, who is wanted by the Australian Federal Police for his activities in the Middle East, has renewed his social media attack on his former home country on a new Twitter account after his previous one was shut down last week.

The 30-year-old invited wannabe jihadists in Sydney - the city where he was born - to contact him if they want to get their hands on dynamite and grenades.

'Anyone in Sydney who is after explosives (dynamite sticks, C4 sticks, orica mine sticks, grenades ) lots more. If interested DM me,' he wrote.

Disgusting: Mohamed Elomar, who is believed to have left Australia last year to fight in Syria, is shown holding up the decapitated heads of two men

Elomar invited wannabe jihadists in Sydney to contact him if they want to get their hands on explosives.

He also gave tips on the best way to avoid the security services.

'Buy a phone cover ur idenity if you have to wear a Niqab, activate simcard with false details, when u use phone make sure in different area,' he wrote.

'That way it's hard for ASIO to track u down, remember "The hearts of freemen are tombs of secrets" and moslem secreacy is faithfulness.'

Elomar and his friend Khaled Sharrouf, also from Sydney, are thought to be fighting with al-Qaeda off-shoot Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and will be arrested on terrorism-related charges if they ever return to Australia.

He reportedly set up the Twitter account after his previous one was shut down

The 30-year-old advised 'brothers who are confused about jihad' to get in touch

Before Elomar's previous Twitter account was shut down last week, he wrote that Australia should be worried about what is coming to it. He also sent tweets aimed directly at ASIO last Tuesday, claiming he had been injured but would soon be fighting again.

Offering up his advice to 'brothers who are confused about Jihad in the West' he said 'please DM I would love to have a chat'.

The account that is purporting to belong to Elomar also claimed he had 'just divorced his wife'.

Elomar's wife Fatima, 29, appeared in court in Sydney on July 8 after she was arrested by joint counter-terrorism detectives at Sydney Airport on May 3 while trying to board a flight to Malaysia.

She was alleged to be carrying cash and camouflage gear on behalf of Elomar.

She was later charged with supporting terrorism, specifically 'preparing for incursions into a foreign state with the intention of engaging in hostile activities'.

The pair have four children together.

'To my 4 beautiful kids inshallah I will see them on day of judgment, this is islam allah swt will test us and test us,' Elomar wrote on Sunday.

Despite jihadists Elomar and Sharrouf using Twitter to threaten ASIO and Australia, transparency reports from Twitter show the Australian government only requested for information to be removed or withheld on Twitter two times in the first part of this year.

The government have also not requested anything to be taken down from Twitter this year.

Twitter said specific requests for the contents of communications, for example what has been sent in direct messages, require a valid search warrant from an agency with proper jurisdiction over Twitter.

Elomar's jihadist friend Sharrouf previously spent time in jail for his part in a foiled plot to blow up targets in Sydney and Melbourne.

He is thought to have flown to Syria with Elomar late last year on his brother Mustafa's passport.

Sharrouf has also taunted Australian police via his social media account recently, boasting that he would 'slaughter' Australians.

Mohomed Elomar (right) used to be a champion boxer. Here he is seen fighting Pises Buachai at the Entertainment Centre in Sydney, Wednesday, March 7, 2007. Elomar won the fight.

Elomar is also the brother of Ahmed Elomar, who was arrested in Lebanon for alleged terrorist links in 2007 and then sentenced to jail in Sydney in June for brutally bashing a police officer in the Hyde Park riots.

The two brothers, Ahmed and Mohamed, used to be champion boxers, Ahmed has competed in more than 20 professional bouts.

In 2007, their father Mamdouh Elomar slammed the clerics who he believes radicalised his sons in Sydney.

Mr Elomar told The Sun-Herald that he urged his children to stay away from Sheik Mohammed at the Global Islamic Youth Centre.

'Sheiks like Feiz ruin people,' Mr Elomar said.

'He is not a sheik; he is brainwashing all these children. I know my religion, so I can tell him when he is wrong, but these kids believe everything he says and think it's their religion. Someone needs to stop him.

'Today our kids are either at one extreme, partying or using drugs, or at another extreme with their religion. I don't teach my children to hate non-Muslims. I have taught them to love everyone.'
