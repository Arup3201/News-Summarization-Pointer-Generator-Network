Danish striker Nicklas Bendtner may be a free agent but the former Arsenal flop has still found a way to work on his shooting over the summer.

But it is not the sort of target practice that most forwards would have in mind during the off-season - as the 26-year-old spent an afternoon firing a shotgun.

Bendtner - who posted the image on his Instagram account - did not have his contract renewed at Arsenal and he will be hoping to hit the target more when he eventually finds a new club, having scored just twice last season for the Gunners.

Target practice: Former Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner shows off his weapon

Free agent: Bendtner is weighing up his options after being released by Arsenal at the end of the season

He has interest from Eintracht Frankfurt but the former Arsenal striker wants to stay in the Premier League.

Villa
 are bringing players in on a shoestring budget and have made Bendtner 
an offer but discussions are ongoing as they try to strike an agreement.

Villa
 are allowing Nicklas Helenius to return to Aalborg on loan while 
Christian Benteke and Libor Kozak are out with long-term injuries. It 
means a return for Darren Bent and a need for more cover with Bendtner 
the target.

Connection: Dane's stay at the club was hit-and-miss, as he struggled with injuries and disciplinary issues
