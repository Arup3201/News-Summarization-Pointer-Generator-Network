Bent crooked over a computer... leaning onto your elbow to answer the phone... slouched on the sofa when you get home... picking up children in both arms... it's no wonder the modern back is a crooked mess of tight muscle knots and painful nodules.

And many of us are spending a fortune every year begging pricey physiotherapists, chiropractors, osteopaths, Pilates teachers and massage therapists to snap us straight again.

But a new gadget - named the Nodger and not much more complicated than a crooked stick - is promising to change our lives forever... and save us a tidy pile of pounds in the process.

Team FEMAIL can't get enough of the crooked contraption, and the 'Nodg-imonials' read pretty impressively, too

The Back Nodger, which costs £29.99, claims to be able to 'instantly relieve knots and muscle tension all over your body' by allowing you to 'self-massage', applying deep and precise pressure into your own knots without the assistance of a doctor, masseuse or even a really good pal. You can do this all on your own.

This method of releasing knots is often known as acupressure or Shiatsu massage, the ancient Japanese technique used by sports masseurs and physiotherapists all over the world by improving blood flow and reducing tension.

To use the nodger you hold the foam handle with two hands, one above the other. Then hook it over your back with the red nodule on the peskiest knot.

my handbag. I have never had so many visitors at my desk wanting to try 
it out. It sounds dodgy, but it works a treat'

Relax your 
shoulders and push the nodger away from you to apply targeted pressure 
into the knot, allowing the pressure to continue for one deep breath in 
and out.

 Alice says: 'Thank You Back Nodger. This is the best product I've 
bought in years. My husband is happy too as he says I don't ask to be 
massaged as much now.'
