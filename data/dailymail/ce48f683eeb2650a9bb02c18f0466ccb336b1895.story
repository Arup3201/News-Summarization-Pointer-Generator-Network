Nine out of ten CQC staff members believe there is a culture of bullying at the NHS watchdog, a shocking report has found.

Analysis of the Care Quality Commission – the shamed quango which has faced damning criticism for its failure to spot a number of healthcare scandals – found that 92 per cent of staff felt bullied or harassed.

Staff said there was a culture of ‘systemic bullying’ with many too frightened to speak out even when promised anonymity because they believed the bullying might get worse or they would be punished as a result.

The CQC was accused of failing to pick up on systematic neglect at Mid Staffs and Morecambe Bay trusts. Staff said they were 'overwhelmed' by work

Workers charged with inspecting hospitals for abuse and neglect were ‘overwhelmed’ by work, caught in a ‘blame’ game and ‘broken’ by the behaviour of their managers.

The £54,000 report was commissioned by the CQC last December after new chairman David Behan said allegations of bullying were ‘shocking and unacceptable’.

It comes a month after the CQC – the official watchdog for inspections of hospitals, care homes, GP practices and dentists – was condemned for covering up its failure to spot problems at Morecambe Bay hospitals where up to 16 babies died through neglect.

In a bid to protect their reputations, bosses at the watchdog told officials to destroy a damning document which said its inspection of the hospital – which gave the trust the all-clear – had been flawed.

The CQC has also been accused of failing to spot the horrific abuse of disabled patients at Winterbourne View hospital.

Former inspectors who exposed catastrophic failings claimed they had been bullied, harassed and gagged to prevent them criticising the regulator. 

Kay Sheldon, a CQC board member, tried to warn that patients were being put in danger by the organisation’s poor performance.

But Dame Jo Williams, chairman at the time, allegedly used taxpayers’ money to commission a mental health assessment of Miss Sheldon and tried to get her suspended.

The £54,000 report was commissioned by the CQC last December after new chairman David Behan said allegations of bullying were ¿shocking and unacceptable¿

Miss Sheldon welcomed the news, tweeting: ‘Bullying culture in organisation was one of the main concerns I raised in 2011. Completely refuted by board & exec team.’ 

Altogether 92 per cent of the 236 CQC staff who gave evidence felt they had been bullied or harassed in the workplace. The report’s authors, at consultancy firm People Opportunities, believe the problem affected ‘the whole organisation’.

Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘The CQC appears not only to have let down the patients it was charged with protecting, but also the commission’s own staff.

‘No wonder it was unable to expose failings within the NHS when it presided over its own culture of bullying and poor management.

‘The organisation urgently needs to show it provides value for taxpayers’ money if it is to retain the faith of the people picking up its bills.’ 

CQC chief executive David Behan said: ‘We are very grateful for the staff who came forward to share their experiences. Without their honesty and courage, we would not have been able to identify improvements that need to be made.’

'Horrified': Ann Clwyd

The biggest hospital in Wales has been branded ‘dangerous’ in a damning report, while an MP compared it to the 2010 scandal at the Mid Staffs Trust.

The report, from the Royal College of Surgeons , claimed patients  at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff had died while stuck on the waiting lists  for operations and that its A&E department was failing to cope with demand.

It warned: ‘Patients are clearly coming to harm. In cardiac surgery we heard patients are regularly dying on the waiting list.’

The perception among doctors, the report said, was that operations were being cut to save money. Labour MP Ann Clwyd, whose husband died at the hospital, said: ‘To hear from the RCS through a leaked report that departments are dangerous, with patients dying regularly, that is horrifying – and particularly because we didn’t know about it.

‘The situation sounds to me  similar to the Mid Staffs situation. This is the Welsh Mid Staffs moment.’ Health board chief Adam Cairns apologised for poor performance at the hospital, but rejected calls for his resignation.
