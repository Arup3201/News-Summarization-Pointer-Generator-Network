Forecasters are expecting up to eight inches of snow in the New York region as the first serious winter storm of the season blanketed much of the northeast.

Armies of salt spreaders and plows, so far used only once or twice this winter, attacked about two inches of snow in New York and Philadelphia. The flurries began about 2.15am Saturday and were expected to let up by Saturday evening.

This winter has been unseasonably dry and devoid of snowfall, thanks to the movement of air pressure above the North Atlantic Ocean, which has kept most of the cold Canadian air out of the northeastern United States.

Before the snow storm today, Philadelphia had received just half an inch of snowfall for the season -- well below the average of 7 inches the city usually sees.

One person died after he slipped in the snow and was run over by a skidding SUV in East Harlem, New York.

About 1,500 customers on Staten Island lost electricity for a few hours as the region coped with its first snow storm.

In New York City, Mayor Michael Bloomberg called a Saturday morning press conference, hoping to avoid a repeat of last season's highly-criticized slow response to heavy snowfall.

The mayor said hundreds of sanitation workers were put on overnight shifts late Friday and began spraying down the streets with salt water to prepare for the onslaught.

Some 1,500 snow plows and more than 230,000 tons of salt are at the city's disposal, though this storm will not require the full might of city resources, officials said.

Forecasters said the white blanket 
wouldn't stick around for too long, though. Freezing rain had already 
begun to fall by 9.30am in Philadelphia as the temperatures warmed above
freezing.

By Sunday, any precipitation was likely to come down in the form of rain as temperatures climb above 40 degrees Monday.

'So it's a short taste of winter and the temperatures continue to be warm through Monday and at least midweek,' Valerie Meola, meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Philadelphia office said.

Flurries and freezing rain is expected for the Washington D.C. area.Â

Philadelphia International Airport is under a ground delay for arriving 
flights because of snow and ice accumulation. A spokeswoman says 
arriving flights are experiencing delays of less than two hours, but 
most departing flights are leaving on time.

The storm marked the first significant snowfall for some East Coast 
residents, including in Philadelphia. A rare October snowstorm knocked 
out power to nearly 3 million homes and businesses in the Northeast.

The northeast flurries come after Chicago was hit by heavy snow yesterday evening as officials worked on Friday to prevent a repeat of last year's 'snowmageddon,' when a blizzard left hundreds of drivers stranded along one of the city's main thoroughfares for up to 12 hours overnight.

Extreme weather is also set to hit the Northeast, with snow forecast to reach Boston, New York and Philadelphia on and Saturday morning.

The snow could go as far south as Baltimore and Washington DC, forecasters say.

With Chicago getting socked by its 
first major snowstorm of the winter and drifts forming, officials 
detoured buses off icy Lake Shore Drive, the iconic road running along 
Lake Michigan.

Bus service was partially restored by the end of rush hour except for the southern portion of the road.

Last year's storm, which dumped more than 20 inches of snow, brought Chicago to a standstill and caused serious embarrassment to a city known for its ability to keep working in some of the most severe winter weather.

Transit spokesman Brian Steele said icy ramps and drifting snow led to the decision to move buses away from the lakefront Friday and onto roads where there was less wind and slower traffic.

No significant problems had developed yet, he said, adding, 'The decision was made solely as a precaution.'

More than 700 flights were cancelled at Chicago's airports, the bulk of them at O'Hare International Airport, the Chicago Department of Aviation said.

While the snow started in the morning, the worst of the storm hit just at rush hour. Eight inches of snow were expected by nightfall, and the National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning lasting until late Friday.

Chicago deployed its full fleet of 278 plows to push through the snow on main streets and Lake Shore Drive, but they had to inch along with commuters headed home in heavy traffic.

'The biggest challenge for us right now is congestion. We're caught in it just like everyone else,' said Guy Tridgell, a spokesman with the Illinois Department of Transportation.

During last year's February blizzard, the city's third-worst storm on record, authorities had to remove 525 vehicles that got stuck on Lake Shore Drive, which was closed for 33 hours.

City officials began work in November to create two turnaround points on the road to make it easier for cars to avoid getting stuck.
