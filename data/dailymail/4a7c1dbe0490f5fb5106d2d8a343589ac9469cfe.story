Scaling back: 21-year-old Bank of America intern Moritz Erdhardt was found dead in his dorm this past August after working three days straight. In response to his death, banking institutions are remodeling their intern programs to scale back work load

Many Wall Street institutions are remodeling their entry-level programs in response to the death last summer of a Bank of America intern who had a seizure after working three days straight.

21-year-old finance student Moritz Erdhardt, from Germany, collapsed and 
died in the shower at his student flat in Bethnal Green, east 
London, after allegedly working through the night eight times in a two 
week period.

When he 
did not show up for work, another intern who lived in the same flat 
called the building manager, who found Mr Erhardt's body in the shower at 
about 8.30pm on August 15.

It is believed his epileptic fit was possibly caused by exhaustion.

Mr Erdhardt's death has rocked the finance world, and now many banks are looking into taking the stress off young employees.

Goldman Sachs formed a 'junior banker task force' that has decided the firm will no longer offer two-year entry level contracts and will instead make young employees full-time from the start.

Junior bankers are expected to get more predictable hours along with opportunities to receive feedback from their managers. Working on the weekend will be discouraged.

'The goal is for our analysts to want to be here for a career,' David Solomon, Goldman’s co-head of investment banking, said in an e-mailed statement to Bloomberg Businessweek. 'We want them to be challenged, but also to operate at a pace where they’re going to stay here and learn important skills that are going to stick. This is a marathon, not a sprint.'

Exhausted: Mr Erdhardt died from a seizure which his family believe was caused from sleep deprivation

According to the New York Post, both JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are looking into restructuring their entry-level programs.

Following Mr Erdhardt's death, Bank of America formed their own panel to look into the summer program but have yet to announce their changes.

Mr Erdhardt's death is even more tragic considering he was on the verge of a job offer after his internship ended.

A source told The Sunday Times he was 
about to be offered a £45,000 analyst job at the bank starting after he 
graduated from university next year.

The
source said: 'He was one of the best interns. They hadn't made him the 
offer yet because they didn't get that far but it was going to happen.'

Talented Mr Erhardt had already completed placements at KPMG Consulting, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank's corporate finance division before working for Merrill Lynch.

Making changes: Goldman Sachs will now be offering new employees full-time jobs instead of the previous two-year contracts. Above, Mr Erdhardt is pictured in the center with friends

Mr Erhadt had studied business administration as an exchange student at the University of Michigan before attending WHU Otto Beisheim School of Managment in Vallendar, Germany.

A representative for the Otto Beissheim School of Management business college where Mr Ergardt studied and from where he was due to graduate next year, called him 'a wonderful person.'

Head of PR Peter Augstin said: 'We are all deeply shocked. He was a wonderful person and a dedicated student. He will be sadly missed. We are still trying to come to terms with his death.'

His emails and swipe card will be analysed to discover
what times he entered the company's buildingnear St Paul's Cathedral 
in the City.

It is believed the student regularly left the office at 5am only to return to the flat to have a shower and change his clothes before returning to work.

CCTV evidence shows him returning to his flat just after 5am on the day he died.

Popular: Friends said Mr Erhardt (pictured left with a friend) called Mr Erhardt, pictured center, the 'superstar' of the internship programme

In an online portfolio Mr Erhadt told prospective employers that his upbringing taught him to always be driven to be good at everything.

He wrote: 'I have grown up in family that expected me, in whatever respect, to excel in life.

'Therefore I have become highly competitive and ambitious nature from early on.

'Already during my times in elementary school I began playing soccer as well as tennis, I engaged in track and field athletics, and I started ski racing.

'Sometimes I had a tendency to be over ambitious, which resulted in severe injuries.

'With respect to my performance in school, I was striving for excellence and trying to be the best all the time.'

Reflecting
on his intensive approach to his education he added: 'Over the last 
year, I have learned that complacency implies stagnancy.'

Mr Erhardt's father, Dr Hans-Georg Dieterle, 51, has said he does not blame Merrill Lynch for his son's death and he and his mother, Ulrike, will be asked to give evidence.

Dr
Dieterle has said his son had been 'exploiting himself' and believes Mr
Erhardt drowned after suffering a seizure in the shower.

He also called on the British Government to restrict working hours like Germany.

A statement from BAML said: 'We are deeply shocked and saddened by the news of Moritz Erhardt'sdeath.

'He was popular amongst his peers and was a highly diligent intern at our company with a promisingfuture.

'Our first thoughts are with his family and we send our condolences to them at this difficult time.'
