Carly Swann suffers from a condition which means she cannot raise a full smile or even blink on the right side

A woman struck by a syndrome that deformed her face has now been the victim of botched surgery - which means she will never smile again.

Carly Swann, 32, was just 14 when her face became paralysed, meaning she cannot raise a full smile or even blink on the right side.

The mother-of-two suffers from a condition called cholesteatoma - an abnormal collection of skin cells inside the ear which apart from
 hearing loss, can also lead to facial nerve damage resulting in a 
weakness to half the face.

For half her life, Ms Swann, from Sheffield,
 avoided looking in mirrors because she was ‘too 
repulsed’ by her own reflection.

In total, she has had 16 operations for her condition.

In 2007, the mother-of-two had an operation at the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield, using muscle taken from her left thigh and put into her cheek.

The operation was a success and she regained control and movement in her face, allowing her to smile again - and for two years she lived a ‘happy’ life.

But when an infection meant her face would need to be operated on again, the outcome left her devastated.

Surgeons at The Royal Hallamshire Hospital interfered with the muscle holding the sling to correct her smile  - which caused it to disappear.

Ms Swann later discovered that her operation notes from 2007 were not requested from the hospital who had corrected her smile and restored her confidence.

She was awarded a substantial sum in compensation from Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust after they admitted clinical negligence.

Ms Swann, who works as a PA, said: 'It was the worst point in my entire life when I saw what they had done - my face was ruined.

'They had completely destroyed my chances of smiling again. I physically hated the way my face looked and just wanted to shut the entire world out.

'What was hardest was that for two years I had finally been happy with the way I looked.

'I could go out with my friends and actually be happy and feel comfortable with my face.

'After the surgery I couldn’t bear to look at myself again and it was the lowest I had ever felt. The two hospitals that did the operations just hadn’t communicated with each other at all.

'If they had read the notes sent over to them they would have known not to remove the muscle and my face would still be fine.

'I’ve had 16 operations in total including having a scar created to look like a laughing line on my right hand side. But I’m not having any more now - I’m done.'

Ms Swann was just 14 when she began experiencing problems.

Friends spotted her drooping face at school after a PE lesson and a GP confirmed she had Bell’s Palsy - a form of facial paralysis - but claimed she should recover in two to three months.

But with no signs of improvement, she was sent for MRI scans which concluded she in fact had cholesteatoma. 

And when she returned to school, she was bullied by her classmates who teased her about her skewed appearance and mocked her by saying she looked like she’d had a stroke.

In the years that followed, she became a recluse who was too embarrassed to go out in fear of seeing her reflection in shop windows.

People would tell her to ‘cheer up’ and she took to covering her face with her hands.

She added: 'I found it really hard to meet new people, and would always angle my face away from them so they could only see my left side.

'I would never eat out at restaurants because I’m not able to chew my food properly because of the paralysis.

“The worst thing about it is when I’ve put it to the back of my mind and don’t think about it.

'Then I hear someone saying, "what’s wrong with her face", or, "why does she look like that"? Then it all comes flooding back to me.'

Despite her struggle, Ms Swann, a single mother of two girls - Ashon, six and Madalyn, 11 - has only recently been able to come to terms with her appearance.

She said: 'It’s only in the last six months that I have got my confidence back since the operation.

'I’ve started to go to a charity called Changing Faces which if I’d been aware of when my facial palsy started, things could have been very different.

'I had been searching for 18 years for someone to talk to and eventually I am now learning to be happy with how I look.'

David Throssell, Medical Director at Sheffield Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'After suffering from facial palsy, Ms Swann had a successful operation at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals which restored some of her facial movements, including the ability to smile.

'We are therefore extremely sorry that a further procedure some years later to prevent a potential serious infection from occurring meant that some benefits of the previous procedure were lost.

'We can only imagine how devastating this must be for her and her family and a full review of Miss Swann’s care has been undertaken as a consequence, and we would like to offer our apologies for this.'
