Fashion week came and went quicker than you can say Cara Delevingne but it isn't just on the catwalk that new trends are born.

Behind the scenes, the most talented hair and make-up artists in the world work like a well-oiled machine to set the next season's beauty trends - and if they have anything to do with it, we'll be wearing fake freckles, smudged lipstick or perhaps even no make-up at all.

FEMAIL went backstage to meet the hotbed of talent conjuring up SS15's beauty looks and we can assure you that you'll be getting creative in six months' time.

Bridal hair: James Pecis, L'oreal Paris' creative director, said he wanted to create something 'strikingly different' for Julien Macdonald's show so used lace cut-outs on models' hair

HAIR 

Last season we welcomed the scrunchie (thanks, Cressida Bonas), but hair accessories are looking more glamorous for next summer.

Julien Macdonald's show was case in point. L'Oreal Paris' James Pecis created what he calls 'mermaid hair', which was slicked back using gel, a recurring theme backstage this season.

For two of Julien's models - the show's brides - James braided the lengths around the nape of the neck and attached delicate sections of lace to the crown with double-sided stick tape.

Pecis said: 'We wanted something very modern and strikingly different.' 

Pipping Pecis in creating something different was the creative team over a Bora Asku.

While most stylists went for a sleek, easy ponytail, or a graphic, urban one like TIGI by Catwalk's at KTZ, the team backstage at Bora's show transformed it into a sort of elephant's tail using black string.

Perhaps the quirkiest look of London Fashion Week was Mark Hampton's for Sophia Webster. 

Dubbed ‘The Cyber Twist’ and inspired by rave-wear, each model was styled as a 90s raver with twisted and knotted hair piled into bows and bunches. 

At PPQ, it was all about glitz and glamour and the team created a modern tiara with a centre parting and lots of glitter spray.

Centre partings reigned supreme at Marios Schwab as well where TIGI by Catwalk created 'childlike' hair. Models' natural hair texture and colour shone through and was punctuated only by a precise centre parting - a style we spotted on numerous catwalks.

If fiddly plaits, hair lace and glitter spray are too much for you to fathom, fear not. Plenty of stylists opted for effortless, loose waves.  

Our favourite style came courtesy of Toni & Guy's Hair Meets Wardrobe global hair ambassador Mark Hampton who created the ‘woodstock waves’ at Marchesa inspired by the  free spirited festival girl the collection was based around.

At Matthew Williamson, he styled hair into 'the flirtatious bounce' to ooze a glamorous Seventies vibe. The look was designed to look 'undone' with voluminous waves creating a understated look that bounced along the catwalk to the cool, hip hop soundtrack.

NAILS

At Brazilian designer Mariana Jungmann's showcase, Ciate nail technician Naomi Gonsalez created metal nails inspired by Yemanja: Queen of the Ocean, a Yoruba deity. 

She painted nails chrome silver layered with a semi sheer finish and decorated with chain and diamente embellishments for one tough luxe look.

X marks the spot: Nails were  rebellious and butter London technicians scrawled graphic symbols onto them

Fashion can come across oh-so-serious sometimes but we can always rely on design trio Joe Bates, Sid Bryan and Cozette McCreery to put the fun back into it. 

The three designers, aka Sibling, are as well known for their fun sensibility as their love of knitwear and they're beauty look followed suit.

Inspired by 80s New York City style, as depicted through the lenses of acclaimed photographers Amy Arbus and Maripol, models played dress up with huge bows worn on their heads.

Nails were notably rebellious and butter London technicians scrawled graphic symbols found on Tatty Devine's tribal inspired jewellery onto nails. X marks the spot. 

MAKE-UP

In some cases, it was a case of more is more. Backstage at Sophia Webster, Revlon created the look and it was as daring as the shoes. Taking on a Mayan masked beauty theme, the models' faces were chalked up white to create an ancient tribal feel.

Eyes followed suit and were darkened with lashings of black eyeliner juxtaposed against vibrant flashes of blue, yellow, orange or purple underneath the eyes aiming to embrace each girl’s individuality.

Tan counts as make-up too, especially thanks to James Read's latest product: the first-ever BB wash off tan.

James created the 'hacienda tan', inspired by the Manchester raves of the 80s and 90s at Sophia's show.

'It's designed to look as though they've been at an acid house rave,' he told us backstage.

'I used lots of moisturiser to create a dewy look and used my new BB Wash Off Tan on top. It's ideal because it hides imperfections but is water-resistant and sweat-proof, perfect for those all-night raves!'. 

The glow giver also trialled his new product backstage at Holly Fulton, whose collection was inspired by the Eighties and Nineties - think a young Jerry Hall.

'This season's must have tan is wet-look poolside chic, glowing and glossy with an overall dewy fresh look,' added James.

Topshop Beauty may have made waves when they unveiled the freckle pencil but it's going south next summer.

St.Tropez sprinkled their way into the top skin finishing trends with a beachside Freckle Tan at Preen by Thornton Bregazzi.

'To tie in with the make up, we added just a breath of base colour to the body, then took the delicate dusting of freckles down from the face onto the chest, arms and legs,' said St.Tropez Global Tanning & Skin Finishing Expert, Nichola Joss.

Eye wise, models were often seen sporting graphic, double-lined eyeliner created using masking tape (a handy trick from Sharon Dowsett).

Brows are still big news - we still blame Cara Delevingne - and at Julien Macdonald they were brightened with a dust of gold eyeshadow by L'oreal Paris' Val Garland. 

'It's all about washes of colour across the eyes, it's very wearable,' she told us backstage.

At Hunter, ‘handsome’, bushy, groomed brows were the order of the day. While they paid lots of attention to brows, L'oreal Paris beauty buffs teamed them with flushed cheeks and glossy lids. 

The Joseph girl, including Sam Rollinson, rocked bold brows created by Maybelline's Sharon Dowsett who said it's important to work with what you've got. 

At Whistles and Temperley, brows were brushed up to create more volume.

Berry nice: Over at Topshop Unique, while the skin was kept minimal, it was the lip that took centre stage. Here shows Jourdan Dunn and Cara Delevingne being beautified

Perhaps the biggest - and most wearable - beauty trend is berry lips. They were absolutely everywhere this season  but throw out your lip liner because it's all about the blurred lines.

FEMAIL went backstage ahead of the Topshop Unique show and watched Cara and co be beautified by Topshop Beauty's mastermind make-up artist, Hannah Murray. 

While the skin was kept minimal, it was the lip that took centre stage. ‘Lips are effortless, with a pop of colour and a just kissed glow. The whole look is designed to look like the girls have done it themselves on the bus, they don't care if their lipstick is smudged,' said Hannah.

It's easy - and purse-friendly - to do yourself at home. Use your finger to help create two textures, firstly pat on Lip Ombre in Baffle, before applying Lipstick in Temptation in the same fashion creating a deep burgundy colour on the lips.

With a clean finger, smudge around the lips to achieve an intense finish with a soft diffused edge and voila, lips a la Cara. 

Lips were lovely over at Burberry as well. Developed by Burberry make-up artistic consultant Wendy Rowe the look featured natural, dewy skin with a huge focus on the deep ruby red lips that were slightly matte.

Good news for the ladies who don't know the difference between a BB cream and a foundation because some make-up artists practically shunned make-up alltogether. 

Make-up maestro François Nars went for absolutely zero make-up at the Marc Jacobs show in New York, opting to spend time on skincare instead, and it seems that he brought it to London. 

Lucia Pieroni, using Nars Cosmetics, created a fresh faced, iridescent and luminous look at Christopher Kane and Val Garland went for a 'beautifully organic' look for Erdem.

At Temperley, Lisa Eldridge  said that relaxed catwalk collections needed to be met with equally relaxed beauty.

The result is bare-faced beauty that is actually extremely achievable and requires most attention on building up a healthy complexion.

'The beauty is very much skin based' says Lisa, adding 'We wanted to create sport-glossy skin that looks effortless.'

When describing how to get the look Lisa explains that using a balm can help achieve the glossy look the girls had on the runway.

'We have just used tinted moisturiser and a super balm on the lips eyelids and eye brows.' 

Here's to a beautiful SS15.
