A leading New Zealand wine brand will begin their upcoming harvesting season by herding an unorthodox new team into their workforce.

South Island winery Brancott Estate will employ Wooly Workers, a flock of about 2000 sheep, to pluck leaves from the vine canopy and uncover the ripening grapes in preparation for picking.

The breed of Romney/Corriedale cross-ewes create a speedier and more efficient means of preparing grapes to be picked at their prime.

Patrick Materman, Chief Winemaker at Brancott Estate, told Daily Mail Australia the Wooly Workers'have been years in the making.

'We have been experimenting with a few different methods for years. In 2011 we first realised the sheep could be integral to harvesting juicy grapes,' he said.

'Not only are they quicker and more efficient than human or mechanical leaf-pluckers, they are just the right height to pluck all the leaves around the bunches, without causing any damage to the fruit.'

While using tractors to pluck the leaves burns an immense amount of diesel, human labourours are highly cost ineffective.

Leaf removal is particularly important for Pinot Noir vines, as the developing fruit needs to be exposed to sunlight to increase flavour and colour in the berries.

While the method has proven highly effective, it does require close monitoring of the sheep to ensure they do not eat the higher canopy's

'New Zealand has cool weather, so this method is very important here. What's more, the dry summer weather means there tends to be very little green feed left on the farms in Marlborough, so they love to come here for a good meal – and luckily for us, they're not interested in the grapes.'

'You'd be forgiven for thinking we're pulling the wool over your eyes,' said Materman. 

'But sheep play a vital role in preparing the vineyards for harvest.'
