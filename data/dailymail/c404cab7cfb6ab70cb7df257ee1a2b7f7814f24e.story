'Idiot': Culture Secretary Maria Miller was accused of doing nothing to involve the rest of the Empire during the 100th anniversary celebrations

Culture Secretary Maria Miller was branded an ‘idiot’ last night amid claims that the commemoration of the First World War will ignore key British allies.

In the latest in a series of rows over the commemorations, allies of Education Secretary Michael Gove expressed concern that the 100th anniversary events will include no special mention of the role played by Britain’s allies in Australia and New Zealand.

Plans have been drawn up to honour soldiers from ‘New Commonwealth’ countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh and India - in order to inspire schoolchildren whose families originated in those countries.

But Australian officials have expressed concern that ANZAC soldiers who fought and died at Gallipoli and in the fields of Flanders will be overlooked.

A senior Whitehall source told the Mail: ‘This is awful - the idiot Maria Miller is doing nothing to involve the rest of the Empire, who sent vast numbers of people to help us.

‘The DCMS [Department of Culture Media and Sport] say they don’t want too much focus on death!’

In an article for the Mail last week, Mr Gove delivered a coded criticism of the commemoration plans drawn up by Mrs Miller, saying there should be greater emphasis on how Germany was to blame for the conflict.

He also denounced ‘left-wing myths’ about the war as a ‘shambles’ peddled by Blackadder and other programmes.

Allies of Mr Gove blamed Mrs Miller earlier this week after Cabinet sources were quoted saying that the Education Secretary should ‘get back in his box’ and stay out of the debate.

The extraordinary spat took another turn last night following claims in Australia that the role of the ANZACs is being ‘whitewashed’ by the Department of Culture.

Casualties: 62,000 Australians died in the Great War but there are fears there will be no mention of them

62,000 Australians died in the Great War but an Australian official quoted in The Australian newspaper said that documents circulated on the commemorations have ignored the ANZACS.

‘There has been no mention of old Commonwealth Allies like Australia or New Zealand but more interest in celebrating the role from New Commonwealth countries,’ the source said. ‘I think it’s fair to say Commonwealth ties are being frayed a little on this one.’

A source close to Mrs Miller hit back, dismissing the complaints in Australia as unfounded and branding the criticism from within Whitehall as ‘petty and childish’.

‘Not only is this complete nonsense with no understanding of our WW1 centenary plans, but such petty and childish comments have no place in government,’ the DCMS source said.

‘We are consistently delivering complicated Government policy effectively and would suggest others focus on doing the same.’

A Culture Department spokesman said: ‘The UK will be commemorating the huge contribution and sacrifices made by members of Armed Forces from Britain, Australia, New Zealand and other Commonwealth countries and Allies in a wide range of centenary events throughout the 2014-2018 period.

‘Helen Grant, Minister with responsibility for the First World War commemorations recently met the High Commissioners from New Zealand and Australia to discuss our plans.

‘We are clear that Britain could not have prevailed without the contribution of our Commonwealth partners and our plans for the centenary will fully reflect that.’
