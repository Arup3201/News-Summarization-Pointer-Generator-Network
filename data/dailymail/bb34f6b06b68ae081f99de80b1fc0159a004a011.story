President Barack Obama will declare the glitches in a new healthcare website 'unacceptable' on Monday as his team scrambles to fix problems that have tainted the roll-out of his signature healthcare law.

Fresh from two weeks of budget battles that have consumed Washington, Obama will hold an event at 11:25am in the White House Rose Garden with consumers, small business owners, and pharmacists who have been affected by the new law.

The move is the highest-profile step in a broad damage control effort that the administration has launched since technical problems with the website, healthcare.gov, have prevented Americans nationwide from signing up for a program that will largely define Obama's domestic policy legacy.

Issues: The new Obamacare website, Healthcare.gov, is not working the way it should. The government admits it needs to be fixed as it is causing 'frustration'

'The president will directly 
address the technical problems with HealthCare.gov - troubles that he 
and his team find unacceptable - and discuss the actions he has pushed 
for to make it easier for consumers to comparison shop and enroll for 
insurance while work continues around the clock to improve the website,'
a White House official said on Sunday.

The
president will say the product itself and the goal behind it - insuring
millions of uninsured Americans - are good despite the problems that 
have plagued its roll-out.

Meanwhile,
the Department of Health and Human Services said in a blog post it was 
bringing in a 'tech surge' of people from inside and outside government 
to help iron out glitches in the online insurance exchanges that are a 
central part of the program known as 'Obamacare,' which launched on 
October 1.

Obama's 
event, the HHS blog, and comments from Democrats on Sunday television 
news shows demonstrated a full-on push to offset criticism from 
Republicans and opponents of the law who say its rollout is 
representative of wider issues.

Tough stance: President Barack Obama will declare the glitches in a new healthcare website 'unacceptable' in a White House address on Monday

Republicans
in Congress have chastised Obama's top health adviser, Health and Human
Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, for declining their invitation to
testify about the glitches to an oversight panel on October 24.

Senator John McCain has described the enrollment process as a 'fiasco'.

Officials stressed on Sunday that the problems were being addressed.

'I
think that there's no one more frustrated than the president at the 
difficulty in the website,'Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said on NBC's 'Meet the Press'.

Obama 
told aides in a recent Oval Office meeting that the administration had 
to take responsibility for the fact that the website was not ready on 
time.

Administration 
officials are expected to travel the country in the coming weeks to 
encourage people to sign up on the exchanges, targeting areas where 
there are high percentages of uninsured, according to one official.

Opposed: Senator John McCain has said the Obamacare rollout has been 'a fiasco'

The
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is expected to provide 
private health coverage to an estimated 7 million uninsured Americans 
through the new online marketplaces that opened for enrollment in all 50
states on October 1.

But
the website, the administration's online portal for consumers in 36 
states, was hobbled by problems including error messages, garbled text 
and delays loading pages.

Administration
officials blame the problems partly on an unexpectedly high volume of 
visitors in its first 10 days. According to HHS, there were more than 19
million visits to the website.

'We are committed to doing better,' the department said in its blog post on Sunday.

Despite the problems, it said, other parts of the system were functioning well.

'Individuals
have been able to verify their eligibility for credits, enabling them 
to shop for, and enroll in, low- or even no-cost health plans,' the 
department said.
