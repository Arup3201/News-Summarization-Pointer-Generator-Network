Australia reached the semi-final’s of the World Cup as they defeated Pakistan by six wickets on Friday.

Under the lights at the Adelaide Oval a drop by Rahat Ali proved to be the turning point as Australia chased down the below-par 213 set by Pakistan.

The recalled Josh Hazlewood took 4-35 to restrict the 1992 World Cup winners to such a low total before Shane Watson hit an unbeaten 64 to give the hosts victory in a fiercely contested tie.

Aggressive, brave, attacking captaincy choices have been the building blocks for the best sides in the World Cup so far.

Brendon McCullum, AB de Villiers and today Michael Clarke are proving that despite the wickets by-and-large being a paradise for batsmen, their ingenuity can and does lead to success.

Yet Misbah brings his own unique style of captaincy to the table with a calm demeanour, even in the face of collapse and struggle, that breeds belief within his side and almost earned them a shock win.

Pakistan came into the match in a confident mood, on the back of four successive victories, following heavy defeats in the first two matches of the World Cup group stage.

Batting first, after winning the toss, seemed the sub-continental side’s best chance of defeating Australia.

Sarfraz Ahmed, Pakistan’s centurion in their previous match against Ireland, couldn’t replicate his heroics as he edged Mitchell Starc to a diving Watson at slip for 10.

And Hazlewood, brought back at the expense of Pat Cummins, justified his selection as he sent down a wide ball that moved away from Ahmed Shehzad and was edged to Clarke at second slip.

With both of Pakistan’s openers back in shed, the indomitable Misbah strode to the crease, in what was to be his final one-day international match.

The circumstances, with Pakistan 24-2 in the sixth over, were nothing new to Pakistani captain who has long been called upon to be the saviour of the side – not least in this World Cup.

But every great sporting saviour needs a bit of luck from time to time and Misbah’s came just two balls into his innings.

Hazlewood steamed in, saw the ball clip the 40-year-old’s thigh pad and hit leg stump, the bails lit-up but then stayed in place.

It was a lifeline both Misbah and his side desperately needed and along with Haris Sohail, Pakistan’s innings began to be rebuilt.

The pair shared a 73-run third wicket partnership and just when they looked ready to propel their side to a competitive total, greed became the undoing of their usually risk-free leader Misbah.

Equally it took a stroke of genius and bravery from Australian captain Clarke, who brought Glenn Maxwell back despite Misbah having twice previously sending the allrounder clear of the ropes and initially sending him out of the attack.

But, it was Maxwell who had the last laugh as the right-handed batsman eyed the shortest boundary once more but instead holed-out to Aaron Finch in the deep for 34.

It was a sad end for one of Pakistan’s greatest players, who passed 3,000 ODI runs as captain during his innings.

A typical Johnson short ball got rid of the set Haris (41) before Maxwell claimed his second scalp of the innings as Umar Akmal (20) was dismissed in an identical fashion to his captain.

So at 124-5 Shahid ‘Boom Boom’ Afridi, the only batsman to have hit more sixes than fours in ODI’s, was required to clear the ropes a few times.

Though he did that, smashing three four’s and one six in his innings, he needed to make far more than the 23 of 15 balls that he amassed. 

Pakistan bowled well early on, but didn't take their chances as Australia began to exert control

Australia’s fast bowlers; Hazlewood and Starc (2-40) had been on top from the beginning of proceedings and after bowling out their opposition for just 213, they were the side on top going into the break.

The statistics really best summed up Pakistan’s batting performance; eight batsmen made double figures, none of them passed 50, all 10 were out caught.

Pace bowlers have dominated the World Cup thus far and with both sides boasting some of the best in business it was of little surprise that Australia faltered in their chase of their modest target.

Sohail Khan trapped Finch plumb in front for just two and although Finch reviewed the decision, there was no changing how straight the delivery was.

What followed, from the eighth over onwards was a masterclass in brutal but glorious fast bowling from Wahab Riaz.

The 29-year-old’s first over accounted for the dangerous David Warner for 24 as he sent a short and wide delivery down third man’s throat.

Wahab’s second got rid of Clarke (8) as another well-directed short ball was gleefully taken by Sohaib Maqsood at forward short leg.

The left-handed bowler continued to steam in and had Shane Watson scampering around as if he was holding a bat for the first time. 

Steve Smith hit an excellent half century to set Australia back on the path to victory at the Adelaide Oval

And for all the world the sensational spell looked to be ending with a third wicket to Wahab’s name but for a spectacularly poor drop by Rahat Ali at fine leg as Watson sent the ball to him.

Meanwhile at the other end Steve Smith, easily Australia’s best batsman for the past 12 months, was batting supremely and with great composure as he passed 50 for the third consecutive innings.

But having made 65, the 25-year-old seemed to momentarily lose concentration and fell lbw to a fuller Ehsan Adil delivery.

The task of seeing Australia home then fell on Watson's shoulders and despite his troubles at the beginning of his innings, he shared an unbeaten 68-run partnership with Maxwell (44 not out) as Australia reached their target with 16 overs to spare.

Undeniably Wahab produced one the greatest World Cup bowling spells and deserved so much more then to be on the losing side.

Australia may have outplayed India, their semi-final opponents, during the tri-series prior to the World Cup but the match on Thursday will be very different.

The 2011 World Cup champions have considerably raised their game and Australia will face their sternest test yet in Sydney as they chase a fifth World Cup title.
