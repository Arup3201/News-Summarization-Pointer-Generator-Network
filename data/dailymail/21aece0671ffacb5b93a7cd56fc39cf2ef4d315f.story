A bitter feud that has torn apart the family of the man who built the euro and reunited his country according to a new book.

Helmut Kohl, who ruled West Germany before reunifying the country in 1990, is estranged from his two sons, who accuse his second wife of 'imprisoning him'.

Walter and Peter Kohl claim their stepmother Maike Kohl-Richter, who is much younger than the former Chancellor, has caused a rift in the family that has led to their father's increasing isolation.

Affair: The sons say they were told by a friend of Helmut Kohl that he had an affair with Maike Richter in the years before popular wife Hannelore, left, killed herself

They say Mr Kohl, 82, who is barely able to walk or speak following a serious fall five years ago, is being kept a ‘prisoner’ by Maike Kohl-Richter, 49, who decides who can see him and writes his letters.

His sons have branded her a virtual 'stalker' and claim his father started an affair with her while still married to their beloved mother Hannelore.

Hannelore killed herself in 2001 after suffering for years from a debilitating condition which made her allergic to light.

Her sons were devoted to her but distant to their father, who they claimed was 'married to politics' as they grew up.

Now their bitterness is directed at Maike, 49, with Peter Kohl claiming she has even had him and his brother removed from the visitor list kept by police allowing access to his home near Karlsruhe.

Since his fall Mr Kohl's days of drinking several bottles 
of fine Rhine wine to wash down his favourite dish - stuffed pig's 
stomach - are long gone.

He
 sees very few people from his old political days with his sons claiming
 his second wife is a gatekeeper who controls every second of his time.

Damning account: Maike is accused of creating her own personal 'Helmut Kohl museum' at her home

It has long been known that Walter and Peter Kohl grew up unhappy in the home of Europe's greatest statesmen; Walter wrote a book two years ago stating as much.

But the new work by Peter, a biography of his mother that is a tribute to her and the way she brought them up, is damning of their stepmother.

He says he learned of his father's marriage to his former secretary over the internet. He said: 'The picture I saw was of a sickly old man, his sad eyes looking as if he wanted helping.

'I think she (Maike) moved quickly to erase all connections and memories of Hannelore Kohl, her children and grandchildren.'

Peter recalls visiting his stepmother's apartment in Berlin before she married him, stating: 'Every conversation with her was a hymn of praise about my father. Her flat in Berlin was full of pictures and souvenirs of my father which made me think of a propaganda film about him.

'I was in some kind of private Helmut Kohl museum. There was Helmut Kohl photography standing or hanging wherever you looked. It was years of careful collection to serve a hero-worship... as one might know from reports about stalkers.'

Kohl-Richter has been criticised in the past by the German press who called her the 'Lady Macbeth of Oggersheim' and said she angered the public after being spotted wearing some of Hannelore Kohl's clothes.

The sons claim their stepmother has also cut off ties to their father's ghostwriter.

'For my father this is all unbelievably damaging and reprehensible,' Peter said. 'I find her responsible for all of this damage. One cannot deal with the intellectual heritage of my father like this.'

Most hurtfully, says Peter, is the knowledge that his father began his affair with her when his mother was still alive.

'A close confidante of my father dated the relationship from the second half of the 1990's,' he said. 'I don't know but I have no reason to doubt it.'

Peter nearly broke down on a TV show last week when he described the last time he had seen their father when he visited him with his own daughter two years ago.

He says he had been initially pleased to
 see them but then indicated they should go 'otherwise there will be a 
huge problem again.' Left unsaid was that the problem was his new bride.

The revelations have come in a new 27-page forward to the 2002 book Hannelore Kohl: Her Life, which is re-released this week.

Kohl-Richter has so far not commented on the claims by Helmut Kohl's sons and has declined to be interviewed by the press.
