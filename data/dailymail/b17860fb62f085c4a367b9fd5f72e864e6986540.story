Prime Minster Tony Abbott stumbled over tough questions about which of his 'three' personas was the real Tony in a gruelling TV interview as it emerged up to six of the Prime Minster's most trusted lieutenants turned their back on him.

Six senior Cabinet members were part of the 39 who backed a spill motion on Monday, as did nine MPs who had previously promised to give him their support and vote it down, according to reports in the Daily Telegraph.

At least one was found making approaches to Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull.

Prime Minster Tony Abbott stumbled over tough questions about which of his 'three' personas was real

In a tense exchange with the 7.30 Report 's Leigh Sales on Monday night, Mr Abbott was accused of being unable to answer basic questions including 'Who are you?' and 'What do you stand for?'

However, after the 61-39 ballot, Mr Abbott promised 'good government starts today', after surviving 'a very chastening experience.'

In a tense exchange with the 7.30 Report's Leigh Sales on Monday night, Mr Abbott was accused of being unable to answer basic questions including 'Who are you?' and 'What do you stand for?'.

Sales said the public had seen three different versions of Tony Abbott.

'We've had the Tony Abbott in opposition, the guy who promised no more chaos, the adults back in charge, there'd be no excuses, no broken promises,' she said.

'Then there's the Tony Abbott that we've had so far in government with the surprise policies and the broken promises and the captain's picks.

Mr Abbott might well reflect on the revelations that six of his ministers turned their back on him and voted for a leadership spill on Monday 

While Mr Abbott expressed contrition about his performance in recent weeks, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten today revelled in the prime minister's misfortune, questioning whether he had the mandate to remain leader

'Now you're offering us a third Tony Abbott, one that's going to change. Who are you?'

The Prime Minister responded: 'Well Leigh, let's just focus for a second on the captain's picks, there have been two captain's picks.'

But Sales interjected: 'Can we actually just focus on the big picture there, because there's been three different Tony Abbotts. I just want to know which one are you, who are you?'

Mr Abbott then steered the conversation back to the topic of 'captain's picks' – more specifically his paid parental leave scheme and his knighthood of Prince Phillip – but Sales pressed him again. 

'How about my point, though, that we're up to Tony Abbott 3.0? Do you accept that you have thoroughly confused the public about what your government is and what you stand for?'

Mr Abbott replied: 'Let's look at the situation that we inherited Leigh.'

Leadership murmurs: Mr Abbott was not opposed by any of his colleagues, including Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull. The pair are pictured sharing a moment on the floor of Parliament as it resumed in 2015

Discussion: Mr Abbott is now formulating plans on how his team can claw back support in the polls

She responded: 'Can we just look at the big picture, about you?'

The Prime Minister then said: 'No, no, I'd rather have a conversation rather than an argument Leigh.'

Sales then said: 'No, no, I think it's a reasonable question and one that voters would be asking themselves and that it would be remiss of me not to put to you.'

Mr Abbott then responded by talking about the budget deficit.

'And let me answer it by saying going into the last election the then government was saying the deficit would be $18 billion,' he said.

'It turned out to be $48 billion, there was a $30 billion budget black hole that the Labor Party created, should have known about, and wasn't telling us about.

'Obviously when the circumstances change, there are some things that have to change with them.'

Mr Abbott continued by defending funding cuts to the ABC, to which Sales responded:

Survivor: Mr Abbott survived the threat to his leadership, but 39 of his own MPs voted against his leadership

'But it's interesting that you're not able to answer the question to me who are you, what do you stand for? Which Tony are you?'

Mr Abbott replied:

'Well obviously we stand for a government which believes in lower taxes, smaller government, greater freedom.

'We are a government that believes in values and institutions that have stood the test of time.

'Above all else we are a pragmatic government which wants to do what works, and if we try to do something sensible one way and it doesn't work we'll try to bring about the same sensible outcome in another way.

'And there are challenges Leigh, we at least accept that there is a serious fiscal challenge, that a bit of intergenerational theft has been going on that the former government started and we are determined to fix.

The victor: Prime Minister Tony Abbott walks from the party room after a majority of his backbench voted against his leadership

'The Labor Party is in denial about all these things. Now, you can embrace a government which is not perfect but which is at least fair dinkum.

'Or you can go with the people that gave us that problem and are now trying to say that it's none of their fault and they're not even going to address it.' 

Analysts predict Mr Abbott will get him through to the May Budget, as long as the NSW poll is not an unlikely unmitigated disaster, along the lines of Victoria and Queensland.

A majority of the Liberal backbench is thought to have voted against the PM and the vote count is considered dire for Mr Abbott, in that there was no direct challenger for his leadership.

Contrast: Mr Abbott swept into the party room meeting accompanied by his deputy leader, Julie Bishop and a large number of supporters. The motion to spill the leadership was lost 61-39

On his own: Malcolm Turnbull arrived to the party room meeting without any colleagues in tow

But the most recent Newspoll suggests the electorate will take some convincing, with Mr Abbott's disapproval rating at a record 68 per cent and Labor holding a clear two-party majority 57 to 43 per cent, if an election was held now.

Worse, the Newspoll figures revealed Mr Turnbull was by far the preferred Liberal Party leader, with 64 per cent voting in support of him compared to just 25 per cent backing Mr Abbott. 

The poor approval ratings are the most bleak ranking for a Prime Minister in more than 20 years, comparable only to Paul Keating in 1994.

The PM conceded the government had been having a difficult time recently, citing the Queensland election result that delivered a massive swing against the Liberals.

'Who wouldn't be nervous after watching the result in Queensland,' he said. 

'So all of us are determined to lift our game and the fundamental point I make is that the solution to all of these things is good government.

'And good government starts today.'  

The sweet taste of the other side's leadership dramas. Labor big-wigs Bill Shorten (centre), Tanya Plibersek and Penny Wong made sure to sweep by the assembled media after grabbing their morning coffees

Mr Abbott swept into the party room meeting on Monday morning flanked by a large throng of supporters but tellingly, Malcolm Turnbull was not one of them, sidling into the meeting on his own. 

The vote was instigated by rebellious backbenchers, who revolted following his controversial decision to knight Prince Philip and the disastrous defeat of Campbell Newman's Liberal National government in Queensland two weeks ago.  

The most influential person to come out in favour of the spill motion was Liberal Senator Arthur Sinodinos, the former chief of staff to Prime Minister John Howard. 

Treasurer Joe Hockey said any Cabinet minister who supported the Liberal leadership spill motion should resign Six did. 

He said he trusted his Cabinet colleagues Malcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop. 

'If you are going to be disloyal to someone, you should front them,' Mr Hockey said. 

Mr Hockey stood by the government's controversial decisions to overhaul Medicare, higher education, pensions and welfare, which have contributed to the leadership unrest.

'We have no choice,' he said of the budget changes.
