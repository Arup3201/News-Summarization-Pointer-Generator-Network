Real Madrid fielded the most expensive line-up in history for their Super Cup victory over Sevilla, with the 11 players costing the club an astonishing total of £364million in transfer fees.

But while Real are far and away the biggest spenders on the planet, despite PSG's attempts in recent years, England’s finest have not been shy of opening the chequebook either as money in the game grows exponentially.

Meanwhile, Spanish rivals Barcelona have paid £75m for Luis Suarez and £50m for Neymar in the past two seasons and can name an eye-poppingly expensive team too.

Sportsmail has organised the costliest starting XIs for England’s big five teams, as well at the Catalans, and found some surprising results. Chelsea top the domestic list, with a team costing £298m – hardly the little horses Jose Mourinho pertains – but it is Manchester United, rather than neighbours City, who come second.

Louis Van Gaal could name a side valued at £255.6m, a price swollen greatly by recent sizeable acquisitions Juan Mata, Luke Shaw, Ander Herrera and Marouane Fellaini.

Manuel Pellegrini’s most expensive XI comes in at £241.5m, although his substitutes would ensure a squad value rockets. A bench of Joe Hart, Fernando, Stevan Jovetic, Alvaro Negredo, Jesus Navas, Samir Nasri, Gael Clichy would cost £94m.

Barcelona also trail United, largely because the club’s most valuable player cost nothing. A Lionel Messi-free side reaches £251.75m in fees.

Liverpool have a team with the lowest overall cost despite Brendan Rodgers splurging most of the Suarez money this summer. They come in at £175.5m, a few million behind Arsenal at £179.3m after Arsene Wenger’s big-money moves in the market.
