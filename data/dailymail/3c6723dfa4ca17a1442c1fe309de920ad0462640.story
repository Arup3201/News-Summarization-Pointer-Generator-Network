Foreign journalists have been invited on a week-long all expenses paid trip to the Great Barrier Reef as part of the federal government's campaign to stop it being put on the United Nations 'in danger' list.

The reporters, who all hail from countries on the world heritage committee, are being flown to Queensland to see the reef and learn about the government's conservation efforts, Guardian Australia reports.

The trip next week, which has reportedly been organised by a Great Barrier Reef taskforce set up by the Department of Foreign Affairs, comes before a Unesco committee meeting in June where the reef's World Heritage status will be considered.

Conservation groups have since hit out at the government saying it should spend less time showing off their efforts to journalists and more time protecting the reef.

'We want to see the reef fixed and protected,' Felicity Wishart, spokeswoman for the Australian Marine Conservation Society, told Daily Mail Australia.

'The government is spending what seems like a massive amount of money sending bureaucrats, diplomats and ministers around the world to try and avoid an 'in danger' listing.

'Now they want to bring journalists to Australia to reassure them everything is under control - it's kind of missing the point.'

A spokesman for the DFAT told the Guardian diplomatic efforts, like the journalist junket, was needed to counter misinformation spread by conservationists about the reef.

'There is currently a campaign to list the Great Barrier Reef as in danger... we think there are a number of assertions about the management of the Great Barrier Reef and its vulnerability which are not grounded in fact and which need to be rebutted,' he said.

The journalists from Germany, France, the Philippines, India, Japan and Portugal will meet with scientists, the chair of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and staff from the Environment Department. 

Environment Minister Greg Hunt stepped up the government's campaign against an 'in danger' listing last month arguing it is the 'best managed marine ecosystem in the world'.

The conservationists say they are worried the journalists will be spun misleading information and will seek to provide them another side of the story when they arrive.

'There's lots of talk and money being spent but there's no protection of the reef,' Ms Wishart said. 

'This is just a spin job to international journalists about the great things they are doing.'
