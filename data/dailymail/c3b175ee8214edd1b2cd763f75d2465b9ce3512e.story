Kath Locket was diagnosed with Foreign Accent Syndrome after she began to sound Polish

A mother-of-two proud of her Staffordshire accent was shocked when she woke up sounding like an Eastern European.

Kath Locket went to bed one night, but was later rushed into hospital unable to speak or swallow.

Baffled doctors eventually diagnosed her with Foreign Accent Syndrome, a condition that has only ever affected 150 people worldwide 

It emerged a rare condition had caused slight damage to the part of her brain controlling language.

This meant that despite being born and bred in Staffordshire, she was left with a strong accent that sounded distinctly European.  

Ms Lockett says she now feels she feels robbed because  she sounds nothing like her family and friends - and is mistaken as a foreigner by people in her local area.

As someone who used to phone into local radio stations regularly, she still has recordings of how her voice used to sound before the incident eight years ago.  

Now, she bursts into tears at the sound of her former Staffordshire accent.

She told ITV's This Morning: 'I feel like I’ve been robbed.

'Now all I get is Italian, Lithuanian, Hungarian, Russian, Polish.

'I have no homeland now.  I want to go home, that’s all I want to do.’

Mrs Locket, who has always lived in Stafford, had been suffering ill health and headaches before she lost her accent.

One night she spoke to her sister on the phone and noticed her voice was changing.

She told This Morning presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden: ‘I started off with just a lisp and I was a bit concerned.

‘With ill health I got over-fatigued, so I thought it was that and went to bed.

‘But when I woke up it was still there and this lisp was getting a little bit strange.

‘On the Tuesday, I was fine and went to work. At that time I could speak.

‘By Wednesday morning, it was starting to go like an alien.

‘And by Thursday, it had gone completely and I lost my swallow as well.’

Doctors confirmed Ms Locket had been struck down with a rare brain condition called severe cerebral vasculitis and she was rushed to hospital.

She said: ‘It was so scary for my family - they were terrified for me. I was in hospital for 13 days and a tumour was mentioned. 

'I had to write everything down because I couldn't speak. By the time I left, I was half a stone lighter because I couldn’t swallow.'

Foreign Accent Syndrome  is speech disorder that causes a sudden change to speech so that a native speaker is perceived to speak with a “foreign” accent. 

Foreign Accent Syndrome is most often caused by damage to the brain caused by a stroke or traumatic brain injury. 

Other causes have also been reported including multiple sclerosis and conversion disorder.

In some cases no clear cause has been identified.

Speech may be altered in terms of timing, intonation, and tongue placement, so that is perceived as sounding foreign.

Listeners can usually still understand the sufferer's speech; it does not necessarily sound disordered.

Foreign Accent Syndrome has been documented in cases around the world, including accent changes from Japanese to Korean, British English to French, American-English to British English, and Spanish to Hungarian.

There have only ever been 150 confirmed cases of Foreign Accent Syndrome in the world so far. 

Despite still having a stammer, Ms Locket said she was delighted when she was finally allowed to go home.

But she soon noticed people reacting strangely when she spoke.

She said: 'My daughters said I needed to get out, fresh air would do me good.

'So I went to the local art gallery in Stafford.

'Instantly, one of the ladies said "Will you fill in a questionnaire?".

'I said "No, it's OK".

'And she said "What part of Poland are you from?".

'And my daughter got a bit upset and defensive and she said "No, she’s from here".

Then, on the bus home, two strangers overheard her accent.

Ms Locket recalled: 'He asked me what part of Russia I was from.

''I thought "What is this, can’t people see it’s just I haven’t been very well?"'

A few days later, Mrs Locket’s daughter saw an article in the paper about Foreign Accent Syndrome.

It told the story of a lady from Newcastle upon Tyne who lost her Geordie accent and now speaks with a Jamaican lilt.

Mrs Locket managed to track down Professor Nick Miller from Newcastle University, a specialist in speech disorders who had helped the lady in the article.

Professor Miller made the diagnosis of Foreign Accent Syndrome, a condition so rare there were just 61 confirmed cases between 1941 and 2012.

Foreign Accent Syndrome is where damage to the parts of the brain controlling speech result in a speech impediment which leave the sufferer sounding like someone from abroad.

The causes are unknown, and there is no current cure. 

Mrs Locket (left) says the syndrome has robbed her of her identity as she no longer sounds as though she is from Staffordshire. Speech disorder expert Professor Rosemary Varley says loss of identity is a common psychological effect of the rare condition

However the psychological effects on sufferers can be devastating.

Ms Locket has now decided to campaign to raise awareness of the psychological effects people that with Foreign Accent Syndrome suffer. 

Professor Rosemary Varley, an expert in speech disorders at University College London said psychological effects, such as loss of identity, are well known in Foreign Accent Syndrome sufferers.

She said: 'When you hear a voice down a telephone you make judgements about the sex, the age, the mood.

'You also have a guess at their education, what job they do and their regional identity.

‘What Foreign Accent Syndrome does is robs you of that regional aspect.’

She added that the condition is 'not at all well-understood'.

Cases are very sporadic, there is no centre for the study of the syndrome and as a result sufferers are often sent to many different doctors before being diagnosed, she said.

As well as speaking in a seemingly foreign accent, sufferers also forget words or struggle to speak with correct grammar, she added.

For Mrs Locket, these symptoms are all too familiar.

‘I have medical students come to my house. I’m a living study’ she said.

Meeting other people with the syndrome has helped, and she know wants to campaign to raise awareness about how the syndrome affects sufferers, and why a cure is so desperately needed.

Mrs Locket said: 'I’m here to give other Foreign Accent Syndrome sufferers a voice. 

'It's not just a headlines in a paper. It’s much bigger than that.

‘It changes the dynamics. I don’t speak like my brother, I don’t speak like my ma. 

'I had struggled saying my daughter’s name, my son gets a terrible time.

‘You don’t realise what it is until it’s gone.

‘Just think for one moment if the voice you have today, the voice your mother has, if they lost that. If they sounded like me.’
