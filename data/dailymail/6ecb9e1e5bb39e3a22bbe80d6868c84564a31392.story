Automatic tax rises on alcoholic drinks, including Scotch whisky, have been axed to bring some cheer to Britons struggling with the cost of living.

The move is part of a £300million sweetener for drinkers which the Treasury freely admits is expected to result in ‘higher consumption’.

In a radical shift, George Osborne is scrapping the alcohol duty escalator, which has increased the tax on drink by 2 per cent above inflation every year since 2008.

Cheers: Chancellor George Osborne announced automatic tax rises on alcoholic drinks will be axed to help bring some cheer to Britons struggling with the cost of living

Budget: Yesterday's Budget included a raft of welcome measures, including cutting the duty on beer, by the equivalent of 1p per pint and freezing the taxes on spirits including Scotch

He is also cutting the duty on beer by the equivalent of 1p a pint and freezing the tax paid on spirits, including Scotch, to support the industry.

The move will be welcomed at a time when Westminster politicians are keen to woo Scots away from voting for independence in a referendum on September 18.

However, the changes represent a major shift in fiscal and social policy away from using taxes to drive up the cost of booze as part of a concerted attempt to discourage excessive alcohol consumption. 

Treasury papers issued alongside the Budget even make clear the changes will lead to a rise in drinking, stating: ‘There will be an increase in consumption compared to the previous policy.’

The change puts the Government on collision course with the medical profession which has been arguing for minimum alcohol prices in order to encourage Britons to cut back.

A programme set up by the parents of IRA victim Tim Parry to support British terror victims was saved.

The Government was embroiled in a row when it emerged the £150,000-a-year Survivors For Peace project faced closure after Lottery funding dried up.

Colin Parry, whose 12-year-old son Tim was killed alongside Johnathan Ball, three, in the IRA bombings in Warrington in 1993, last month  criticised David Cameron’s ‘offensive and thoughtless’ refusal to throw it  a cash lifeline.

y the Chancellor committed a full year’s funding to the programme and vowed to look for a permanent solution.

The timing of the news was particularly poignant for Mr Parry and his wife Wendy who today mark the 21st anniversary of Tim’s death.

Mr Osborne said: ‘Survivors for Peace no longer receives lottery funding. I know myself what incredible work they do.

‘To honour the memory of all victims of terrorism, we will provide the funding the programme needs.’

Announcing the changes, Mr Osborne said: ‘Scottish whisky is a huge British success story. To support that industry, instead of raising duties on whisky and other spirits, I am today going to freeze them. And with some cider makers in the West Country hit hard by the recent weather, I am going to help them by freezing the duty on ordinary cider too.’

While home drinks producers have been given tax breaks, the Chancellor said wine, which is mainly imported, will rise by 6p a bottle. High-strength sparkling cider goes up 8p a bottle.

Mr Osborne said the automatic price rises linked to the alcohol duty escalator were no longer necessary or justified.

‘We’ve introduced new laws to prevent alcohol being sold below minimum tax rates, and this helps prevent supermarkets undercutting pubs, and helps stop problem drinking,’ he said.

‘It’s a far more targeted approach than the alcohol duty escalator hated by many responsible drinkers.’

However, the Treasury documents said the new rules will increase consumption and cost the Government £300million a year in lost taxes because of the savings given to drinkers.

Katherine Brown, of the Institute of Alcohol Studies, condemned the change as ‘staggering’. She said: ‘With alcohol costing the country £21billion a year, and alcohol-related hospital admissions more than doubling over the last ten years, it comes as a shock to learn that the Chancellor believes that it is right to further incentivise drinking by making alcohol cheaper.

‘It is yet more evidence to suggest the Government has turned its back on public health and frontline workers such as nurses and police offers, who have to mop up the mess that alcohol creates day in day out.

'It is yet another sad day to see how the profits of multi-national alcohol producers have been prioritised over public health and safety.’

While drinkers have been spared rises in duty, there has been no protection for smokers.

The duty on a pack of 20 cigarettes has gone up by 24p. It will rise by 8p on a pack of five small cigars, 23p on a 25g pouch of hand-rolling tobacco and 13p on a 25g pouch of pipe tobacco.

Scottish vote: The move is likely to be welcomed at a time when politicians are keen to woo Scots away from voting for independence in the referendum on September 18

Theatre companies will get tax relief of up to 25 per cent.

Performing arts companies, including those putting on dance, opera and plays, will  be eligible for a tax break of  20 per cent.

Regional firms that tour will have their bills cut by an even more generous 25 per cent for any initial investment in new productions. The tax changes will come into effect September 1 following a consultation.

Theatre firms, many of which  operate as charities, will welcome the move, particularly because it comes after cuts to funding for the arts during the recent austerity years. The Treasury said the tax cut would be worth up to £15million a year and was in recognition of the ‘unique value that the  theatre sector brings to the  UK economy’.

The Chancellor told MPs that he was applying the same tax relief to theatres that is already offered to film companies.

The Coalition’s new transferable tax allowance for married couples was made slightly more generous yesterday.

George Osborne announced that  the amount a person in a couple can transfer will be raised in line with  the increase in personal income tax allowance.

It was originally planned that a married person who earns under the £10,000 income tax threshold would be allowed to transfer £1,000 of their allowance to their spouse – reducing their annual tax bill by £200.

But now the Chancellor’s move to raise the personal allowance to £10,500 means a husband or wife will be able to transfer £1,050 of their allowance to their spouse, cutting their annual tax bill by £210. 

Only the 24million basic rate taxpayers will benefit, but David Cameron has signalled he wants to go further if re-elected with a Conservative majority. Labour have said they will scrap the tax break if they win the election.

Flood defences will get a £140million boost following the devastation of the wettest winter for 250 years.

The cash injection will be used to repair and improve defences across Britain, after about 5,000 properties were flooded and the Somerset Levels left underwater for weeks, causing around £1billion of damage.

David Cameron visited flood-hit areas last month and said money would be ‘no object’ in the relief efforts. He promised a £5,000 ‘repair and renew’ grant to help homeowners who had been affected.

But Labour claims the budget for maintaining defences has been cut by 20 per cent under the Coalition, affecting flood-hit areas in theSouth East and South West. 

Green groups say more money for defences is urgently needed.

They point out that the Government’s climate independent advisers recommend an extra £500million.
