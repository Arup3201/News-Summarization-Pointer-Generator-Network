Casey Kasem's children are being prevented from visiting their ailing father according to his daughter Kerri.

Kasem, now 81, was known for his years as the host of the countdown show ‘American Top 40’.

He is suffering from Parkinson's disease and retired from his radio hosting in 2009.

Kerri, Mike and Julie Kasem say they have not been allowed to see their father for three months.

Kerri, Mike and Julie Kasem say they have not been allowed to see their father Casey Kasem (right) for three months because of their step mother, Jean (left)

Protest: Casey Kasem's three children along with friends and colleagues  attempted to see their seriously ill father in Holmby Hills, California on Tuesday

Refusal: Jean Kasem pictured with Casey, pictured back in 2003, 23 years after their marriage

His oldest daughter Kerri Kasem alleges Jean Kasem 
has 'aggressively blocked the kids from the house.'

‘I don't get
it, I don't understand it,’ said Kerri to Fox News ‘He has 
Parkinson's and all the research we've done indicates socialization 
would help him. He needs help walking but this was three months ago.

We
don't know how much he's deteriorated. We don't know about his medical 
care. We don't have phone numbers for his caretakers, we don't have 
phone numbers to the house.

We're not allowed to know who his doctors are. We're pretty scared at this point.’

Kerri says she has no idea why she might be banned from seeing her father 
however her father told he in the past that her step-mother was 
insecure.

She says that she hasn’t even been allowed in the house for 10 years.

‘Jean has never, once  in the 30 years called us up and said, 'Let's hang out, let's do something.' It just doesn't happen.

Not your typical wicked step-mother: Casey Kasem's children say they know they have already been cut out from their fathers' will but do not regard Jean Kasem (pictured) as evil because there is 'no communication'

She's
never wanted a relationship with any of us. It's not just the kids. 
This is his brother, our cousins, my Dad's best friends, people he's 
worked with,’ she says.

According
to TMZ, Kerri, Julie and Mike have hired a lawyer to negotiate with 
Jean and say if she doesn't let them see their dad, their lawyer will go
to court and ask a judge to create a conservatorship for Casey and make
them the conservators.

WARNING CONTAINS STRONG LANGUAGE

Listen below to hear one of Casey's legendary meltdowns

Police called: Jean Kasem called law enforcement to get the protesters to leave

Breaking it up: The police arrived at the house to try to calm the group of placard holders

Issues: Kerri Kasem says she has no idea why she might be banned from seeing her father however her father told he in the past that her step-mother Jean (pictured) was insecure. She says that she hasn¿t even been allowed in the house for 10 years

In fact, she and her siblings - from Casey's first marriage to Linda Myers - just want to see their father.

'Your children are here for you,' Kerri told the website. 'We have not abandoned you."

The group held signs up with various messages imploring Jean to relent.

One of his daughters held up a neon placard with the words: 'Jean, why won't you let me see my Dad.'

Apparently, the protest has nothing to do with money. None of the children are beneficiaries in Casey’s will.

Peacemaker: A police officer was seen ringing the buzzer in an attempt to speak to Jean Kasem

Loud and clear: Casey's kids haven't seen their father in so long and are anxious to know how he's faring

Kerri
Kasem told Fox News, 'She can have it all.' We've always said this to 
our Dad, 'Give it to her. Come and live with people who love you.'

We don't want any of it. We don't care about the money. We make good livings. We're all self-sufficient.

We all have great jobs, great careers, self-esteem and we're proud of who we are. I am who I am today because of my Dad.

I'm not after his money because of the morals and integrity I have because of how my father raised us.

I just want to see my Dad before he dies, that's it! It's awful because
we are such a close family. I talked to my Dad every single day before 
he got sick and couldn't talk on the phone.’

Kerri
Kasem believes that if her father is allowed contact with his kids, 
receives the  medical care he needs and the physical therapy and the 
love, his condition could improve somewhat.

Taking a rest: The protesters took a break and sat down on a wall

Don Pitts, Kasem's agent of more than 35 years, told CNN he did not want to take sides in the argument, but he did say Casey is still of sound mind at age 81.

'He has Parkinson's, has it very bad. It took his speech, and for somebody who made millions of dollars using his voice -- for him to lose that gift, that beautiful instrument -- it must be frustrating. But he's handling it very well,' Mr Pitts said.

'His mind is very sharp, his brain works well. You can tell in his eyes he understands everything you're saying. He just has trouble translating it from the brain to his vocal cords.'

Kasem was married to Linda Myers from 1972 to 1979 and had three children together: Mike, Julie, and Kerri Kasem.

Kasem has been married to American actress Jean Kasem since 1980 and had one child together, Liberty Jean Kasem.

Along with his successful DJ-ing career,
Casey was a prominent voiceover actor, famously voicing the character 
of Shaggy in the Scooby-Do franchise.
