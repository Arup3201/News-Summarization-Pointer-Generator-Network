Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy was feeling less vibrant than his team's bright orange strip after they blew a chance to climb into the play-off places.

The Tractor Boys, who have now lost four of their last five away games, were caught cold by goals in the opening 30 minutes by Huddersfield strike pair Nahki Wells and James Vaughan.

McCarthy responded by making two changes at half-time and was rewarded when Luke Varney reduced arrears earlier in the second period.

Goals: Wells 12, Vaughan 30

Ipswich: Bialkowski; Chambers, Smith, Berra, Fryers; Chaplow (Bishop 45), Skuse, Tabb (Williams 67); Varney, Murphy, Wood (Sears 45)

Goal: Varney 48

Bookings: Smith, Berra 

But Ipswich couldn't force an equaliser let alone manage the victory that would have seen them leapfrog Brentford into the top six.

'We were poor – nowhere near as competitive as usual,' said McCarthy.

'I was very angry at half-time and strong words were spoken. 

'I had to walk off at the end to calm down slightly rather than shake all the players' hands. It's been disappointing, let's leave it at that.'

Huddersfield, who hadn't won in seven matches, went ahead after 12 minutes. 

Wells capitalised on loose play from Zeki Fryers and curled a left-footer into the corner for his 13th goal of the season.

After Ipswich's 23-goal top scorer Daryl Murphy had seen an effort cleared off the line, the home side extended their lead after half-an-hour when James Vaughan rose well to head in Jacob Butterfield's cross at the far post. 

Luke Varney headed a goal back after 48 minutes but Huddersfield deservedly held out to leave manager Chris Powell declaring: 'We deserved it. 

'Our first-half display was arguably the best we've played since I've been here. 

'Vaughan and Wells took it to them from minute one.

Fortunately for Ipswich's promotion hopes, three of their remaining five matches are at Portman Road starting with bottom-of-the-table Blackpool on Saturday.

McCarthy added: 'I don't feel happy-slappy at the moment but me and (assistant) Terry Connor will watch this game back at seven o'clock in the morning and we'll start preparing for the next one. 

'I don't have any fears about the response on Saturday.'
