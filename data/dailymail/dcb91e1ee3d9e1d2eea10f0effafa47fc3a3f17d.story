Mystery: Katrice Lee was only two when she went missing from a British Army base in Germany in 1981

The family of a little girl who disappeared more than 30 years ago have spoken of their devastation after David Cameron ruled out any further investigation of the mystery.

Katrice Lee was only two when she went missing from a British Army base in Germany in 1981.

Her parents believe military police made mistakes in the early stages of their investigation into her disappearance - but the Prime Minister has resisted calls to reopen the inquiry.

Katrice's father, Richard Lee, 62, today appealed to Mr Cameron to meet the family to explain why the case will not be taken forward.

Mr Lee, who lives in Hartlepool, County Durham, said: 'I want to meet up with the Prime Minister and I want him to look me in the eye and tell me why he isn't looking into the case any further.

'He said he was going to and then he met up with the military police, but why hasn't he asked to meet up with us and get our side?'

Mr Cameron promised to look into the case last month when Tory MP Caroline Dinenage raised it during Prime Minister's Questions.

But Ms Dinenage, the local MP for Katrice's mother, Sharon, of Gosport, Hampshire, received a letter from Mr Cameron stating that the case would not be reinvestigated.

Mr Cameron wrote that he had reached the decision following a meeting with military police.

It is another blow for Katrice's family, who have campaigned for three decades for police to release their files on the case.

They claim military police have been uncooperative over the years and that mistakes were made in the hours after Katrice was reported missing.

Mr Lee said: 'Things weren't done that should have been done 30 years ago and now the people who are working in the office with the Prime Minister are people who were never there in the beginning.

'Who better to speak to than us, Katrice's family?'

Mr Lee has been working with Hartlepool MP Iain Wright to push for progress in the case.

He said: 'I'm not going to let this issue go away. I won't give up.'
