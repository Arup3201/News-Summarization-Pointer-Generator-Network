A French family has been massacred by a gunman who opened fire on their car then fled to Belgium and attempted to overdose on pills.

Local officials told media the family of three all died when a gunman opened fire on their vehicle in the town of Grande-Synthe.

Forensic police officers were pictured working late last night at the scene of the shooting in northern France.

Local prosecutor Eric Fouard said the gunman opened fire on the family in a busy area near the town of Grande-Synthe.

The attacker then fled east from the town - which is located near Dunkirk - and into Belgium.

A Frenchman aged in his 70s was killed, alongside his 69-year-old wife and their daughter who was in her 40s.

Mr Fouard said the suspect was arrested not long afterwards in Belgium, where he had attempted to overdose on pills.
