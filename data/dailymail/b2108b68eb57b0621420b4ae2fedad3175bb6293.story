A surfing enthusiast who couldn't bare to hang up his wetsuit for winter has taken to the snow with his surfboard in tow. 

Charles Navillod, 26, braved the cold spells when he ventured out on his surfboard in Tignes, France, in just his wetsuit.

After a few attempts, he mastered the art of snowboarding on a surfboard.

French photographer Tristan Shu, 37, shot these photos of his friend Charles, whose surfsnow adventure was made all the more tricky by the light powdery snow.

Mr Navillod said: 'I'm a keen surfing enthusiast and I thought why not combine my passion for surfing with my passion for snowboarding.

'It is surprisingly a lot different snowboarding on a surfboard, as the board cuts through the snow a lot more than a snowboard does, but once you get used to the way the board moves, it isn't all that bad.

Charles Navillod couldn't bear to hang up his wetsuit for winter so he took to the slopes

'Being from the alps, I've always skied, and I wanted to try something new, something exciting to throw me off guard and then I had a brainwave moment - I would ski with a surfboard.

'I wore a wetsuit because I didn't want to be weighed down by all my snow gear, especially as I knew getting my balance on the surfboard was going to be trickier than getting my balance on a snow board.

Mr Shu said he wasn't sure if it was going to be a great success or a big flop but luckily Charles pulled it off

'I would say it isn't to everyone's taste, but it was certainly good fun and urge people to have a go if they want to shake up their annual snowboarding holiday.' 

Mr Shu said: 'Watching Charles snowboard was quite a marvel.

'I wasn't sure whether it was going to be a great success or a big flop, but luckily, he pulled it off, he looked like he enjoyed himself and I got some great photos of the bizarre day.'
