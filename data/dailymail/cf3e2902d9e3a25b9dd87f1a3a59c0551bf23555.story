Ronald Koeman wants to bring Graziano Pelle and Terence Kongolo to Southampton from his former club Feyenoord.

The striker and centre back could follow their former manager to St Mary's with Pelle the subject of an Â£8million bid.

Kongolo is on international duty with Louis van Gaal's Holland side but has only played one minute so far - as a late substitute against Chile.

Meanwhile, Sammy Lee will become Koeman's assistant after plumping for a move to Southampton over Championship side Brighton.
