Murder mystery: William Glenn, 44, from Mississippi, has turned up strangled to death and wrapped in a curtain in Phnom Pehn, Cambodia, where he had been teaching English for two months

Police in Cambodia are investigating the mysterious death of an American teacher whose body was found wrapped in a curtain at a garbage dump in the capital of Phnom Penh.

U.S. diplomats in the Southeast Asian nation could not immediately be reached for comment. But Cambodian police official Mom Sitha identified the man as

The victim has been identified by authorities in Phnom Penh as 44-year-old English teacher William Glenn, a native of Mississippi, who had been in Cambodia for two months, working at several schools in the capital.

According to police official Mom Sitha, Glenn left his guesthouse early Tuesday on a motorcycle taxi and never returned. His body was discovered Wednesday, and no suspects have been apprehended yet, he said.

Earlier this week, Glenn’s estranged Thai wife has revealed that the teacher had told her of his fear that 'someone was after him' shortly before he disappeared.

Nittaya Glenn, 44, said in a phone call from Bangkok that her husband was living in fear shortly before his death.

She told the Cambodia Daily: 'He called me many times and said that some Cambodian people wanted something from him.

'He was afraid and wanted to leave quickly.'

The woman said she had suggested her estranged husband relocate to China and even offered to pay for his plane ticket.

Mrs Glenn said the last time they spoke was on Monday - three days before his body was found.

She claimed that her husband had a drinking problem and could sometimes be aggressive, but the problems had never been severe enough during their marriage to get him into serious trouble.'

'Yes, we had marital problems like many people and he sometimes got into fights when he was drunk.

'But I don't understand that in five years in Bangkok it was always sorted out - yet in two months in Cambodia he is murdered.'

The murder of Mr Glenn - who is believed by detectives to have been strangled to death - has sparked lengthy debates on expatriate forums in Cambodia, with numerous conspiracy theories being put forward for his murder.

They range from a drug deal gone wrong, a failure to pay borrowed money to flirting with another man's wife.

Other writers have suggested that the roots of Glenn's troubles lie in Thailand, and that he might have been the victim of an 'international hit'.

Gruesome discovery: Glenn's body was discovered by a young boy in a garbage dump in Phnom Pehn Wednesday

But Phnom Penh police said last night that no reason for Glenn's murder had been found and investigations were continuing, along with assistance from the US Embassy in Phnom Penh.

Mr Glenn's body was discovered by a young boy searching for 'anything useful' in the garbage dump.

Expatriate residents have expressed both suspicion and sympathy in their posts, but point out that people who worked with the American at a local school doubt there was 'local involvement' in his death.

His former colleagues are said to have based their beliefs on what William Glenn had told them about the life he left behind in Thailand, although no details about this have emerged publicly.

But many people tend to agree that the method of disposing of the body points to premeditation, rather than a robbery gone wrong.

In a fatal robbery, they say, the body would have been left at the scene of the crime, whereas Glenn had been tied up and then swathed in a curtain before being driven to the place where his body was found.

The Khmer Times said that speculation about a relationship gone wrong was rampant and dumping a body in a visible place guarantees it is found quickly and ensures payment should it be a contracted death.

Glenn, who had recently been teaching at an English school in the city before he reportedly stopped working there, had been staying at the Tattoo Guesthouse, where he was said to be a perfect patron.

A receptionist told local reporters that Cambodian police and 'the FBI' had spent four hours searching his room and taken away all his belongings.

'He was always sitting alone writing in a book or on his laptop, but he came back every night, even at the weekends,' the receptionist told the Cambodia Daily.

Mr Glenn arrived in Phnom Penh shortly after midnight May 4, travelling on a bus from Bangkok, said 22-year-old receptionist Kim Chhern.

'I only spoke to him when he arrived but when I saw him he was always alone and often drunk, she said. 'But he was no trouble and only complained about the internet
