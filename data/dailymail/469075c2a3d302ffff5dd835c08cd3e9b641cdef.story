Roma are stepping up their pursuit of Tottenham defender Vlad Chiriches.

The 24-year-old pulled out of the club’s tour of the USA and has been on the list of targets for Roma coach Rudi Garcia for more than a year. He has struggled to settle in England and is keen on Italy.

Chiriches arrived at White Hart Lane from Steaua Bucharest last summer in a deal worth £7.5 million but made only 17 league appearances during an interrupted debut season in the Premier League.

Not Spur? Vlad Chiriches has emerged as a target for Serie A side Roma
