Guilty: Tracey Lynn Garner has been found guilty of murder August 29, after killing an Alabama woman by giving her silicone injections as a buttocks enhancement

A Mississippi woman was convicted yesterday of murder in connection to illicit silicone buttocks injections that led to a Georgia woman's death.

Tracy Lynn Garner, 54, was found guilty of depraved-heart murder and conspiracy to commit wire fraud in the 2012 death of Karima Gordon, 37, after a jury deliberated for five hours, according to the state attorney general's office.

The murder conviction carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.

'We felt confident that the evidence would lead to a conviction,' Attorney General Jim Hood said.

'We hope this verdict will deliver some sense of justice for Ms. Gordon's family.'

Judge Winston Kidd set sentencing for Tuesday. 

Garner was immediately taken into custody after the verdict was read.

Her attorney, John M. Collette said he could not comment on the case because a gag order remained in effect.

Gordon, an Atlanta-area resident, died eight days after receiving the injections in 2012.

Prosecutors said Gordon's death was caused by injections that Garner administered.

They said Gordon was referred to Garner by Natasha Stewart, an adult entertainer also known as Pebbelz Da Model.

Stewart was convicted of manslaughter in February and is serving a seven-year prison sentence.

The prosecution said Stewart told Gordon that Garner was a nurse.

During the trial, Colette suggested that Gordon wanted exactly what Garner had to offer.

'She wanted this underground, bargain basement butt enhancement,' Colette said.

He
 also stated that Gordon had other injections that could have caused her
 death, and argued that the silicone found in Gordon's body didn't match
 silicone seized from Garner's Jackson home.

'We don't know how much she'd gotten before she ever came to Mississippi,' Colette said.

'What silicone caused her death?'
