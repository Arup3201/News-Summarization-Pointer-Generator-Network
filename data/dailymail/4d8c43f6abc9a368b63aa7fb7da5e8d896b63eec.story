As any music fan knows, stuffing headphones into a bag causes them to become tangled, or damaged.

The Mous Musicase attempts to solve this problem by storing the headphones inside a phone case fitted with a ‘winder.’

This means the headphones are protected, but they can also be extended or retracted easily, by spinning a handle on the back.

The Mous Musicase is the brainchild of Josh Shires and James Griffith.

The London-based designers experimented with prototype versions of the case using a 3D printer, and have now set up a Kickstarter campaign to fund further development. 

The case is currently available for the iPhone 5, 5S and 6, although a 5C case is in the pipeline if the pair raise enough funds, and Mous is only compatible with Apple’s proprietary headphones.

But, Mr Shires told MailOnline that if the campaign is successful, he will expand the range to other handsets and headphones.

Early bird backers can buy the case for £15 ($23)

A basic black case costs £17 ($27), a white Retro edition costs £19 ($30), and the limited edition Kickstarter green model is £21 ($33).

Once the campaign ends, on 9 December, the cases will start at £19.99 ($31). 

Customers will also be able to customise and choose their own case and winder colour combination, with prices starting at £24 ($38).

If successful, iPhone 5 and 5S Mous Musicases will be shipped internationally in time for Christmas.

James Griffith told MailOnline: ‘We really wanted to make a product that just fitted into people’s lives.

‘Mous Musicase solves the problem of tangled, damaged and forgotten headphones in the form of an iPhone case.

‘It’s the busy week mornings when you really see this problem come to life.

'I have seen people with their Daily Mail in one hand, their other hand attempting to untangle their headphones.’

Josh Shires added: ‘Mous Musicase integrates the protection of a case to your headphones too, giving you peace of mind that you’ll get your headphones out the way they should be - undamaged and untangled’.

‘We have designed a solution to these really big problems without compromising on its aesthetics.

‘Mous Musicase has been built in a way to look both bold and quirky but at the same time compliment the Apple design.’ 

At the time of writing, the campaign had raised £2,152 ($3,405).

Inspired by headphones constantly getting tangled in a bag, experts from the University of California, San Diego, recently investigated the probability of knotting, the type of knots formed and the dependence on string length in their study.

Dorian Rayner and Douglas Smith confirmed that ‘complex knots often form within seconds’ and that stiffer wires are slightly less likely to form such mind-boggling tangles.

When shaken up, the wires form coils and the loose end weaves though the other strands, creating the annoying knots.

Professor Robert Matthews from Aston University then set out to investigate this so-called ‘Murphy's Law of String’.

Murphy’s law is an adage that basically means anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. Similarly, Matthews said that any string that can get into knots, will do.

Building on earlier mathematical research, he concluded that string - and headphones - really does have a perverse tendency to knot spontaneously.

He also found the longer the string is, the more likely it is to spontaneously knot.

Joining the ends together dramatically reduces the probability of the string performing the manoeuvres needed to form knots, making tangling less likely, something he calls the Loop Conjecture.
