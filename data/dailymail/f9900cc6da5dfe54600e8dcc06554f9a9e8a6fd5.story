Guilty: Lee Howett, 26, was jailed for two and a half years for stabbing a man with a pair of hairdressing scissors

A gay hairdresser has been jailed for two and a half years after he stabbed a man with a pair of scissors in revenge for making a homophobic comment.

Lee Howett snapped after a passenger waiting at Basildon rail station, Essex, abused him over his sexuality during a series of skirmishes.

The 26-year-old then took a pair of hairdressing scissors from his bag and stabbed him close to his right shoulder blade.

Judge David Owen Jones told him: 'People who use scissors as a weapon in a public place to stab somebody must face imprisonment.'

Howett, of Stanford-le-Hope, Essex, was in an emotional state after confronting an ex-partner, Basildon Crown Court heard.

He lashed out at a man who was with a group of people enjoying a night out, the court heard.

Howett had been drinking heavily and was sitting on a bench waiting for a train to arrive at Basildon station when a group of three men carrying pints of beer joined the platform at around 11.15pm on Sunday, June 24.

The trio had been celebrating after one of them found out he was set to become a father for the first time.

But Howett became annoyed with their rowdy behaviour and shouted at them to shut up. 

Two separate scuffles broke out, during which a homophobic comment was made by the victim, who also sustained a bite mark from Howett.

Howett then went back to the bench and took a pair of hairdressing scissors out of his bag before approaching the group for a third time and stabbing the victim close to his right shoulder blade.

The court heard how the defendant was emotional after a confrontation with his ex-partner in a Basildon pub.

The couple had broken up just two weeks before the incident following a volatile relationship.

Chris Whitcombe, mitigating, said: 'Having been abused by his ex-partner it is right to say that his emotions were running high.

'By the time he got to the train station the situation was extremely raw and whilst that doesn’t excuse his behaviour it puts it into context.

'Howett has been subjected to homophobic abuse since his school days. He has been an openly gay man since his teenage years.

'He would normally get up and walk away and had never confronted anybody before, but whatever had taken place previously was the catalyst and he reacted extremely badly.'

Following the attack Howett waited at the train station for police to arrive and made a full admission.

He pleaded guilty to one count of wounding with intent.

Judge David Owen Jones sentenced Howett to two and half years in prison. 

Addressing Howett, he said: 'It may be and I accept it probably was the case that one of the young men made a homophobic comment towards you.

'That must have been hurtful but unfortunately you reacted very badly when it would have been easier to distance yourself from the group.'
