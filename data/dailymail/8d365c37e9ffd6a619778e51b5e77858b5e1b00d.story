Thousands of miles from the playground, real lessons of life and death are played out every day in what's left of the wild world.

This was one such class in Kenya's Maasai Mara National Park, where a lioness taught her cubs how to hunt and kill a wildebeest to stay alive.

Captured by South African photographer Mark Dumbleton, the lioness began by circling her prey before her cubs joined the hunt.

The animal fought back - but outnumbered and separated from the herd, it was only a matter of time before it was overpowered.

Mr Dumbleton, a wildlife photographer since 2007, said: 'It was amazing to watch a mother training her children for when they have to leave the pride.

'I couldn't believe the animal instinct they had. The lioness was roaring at them, but they knew exactly how to take down such a large animal.

'The whole experience only lasted a couple of minutes.'

Red in tooth and claw: Deep in the Maasai Mara, a lioness prepares to teach her children how to hunt

Circling: Captured frame by frame, the animals close in on a wildebeest separated from its herd

Chase: Weighing more than 500lbs when fully-grown, the wildebeest initially managed to evade capture 

Running: The lion cubs pick up on tips they have been taught by their mother and attack from both sides

Fear: As the rapid-fire sequence unfolds, the wildebeest kicks up dust in its frantic bid to escape

Weakening: The wildebeest then begins to slow, coming face to face with the animal which wants to take its life

Teamwork: Lionesses hunt in prides, rarely alone, and here the mother closed in to help her cubs

Overpowered: Outnumbered and tired, this was the moment the wildebeest could no longer put up a fight

Eyeing its prey: The family unit take a look before one of the animals sinks its jaws into the stricken beast

Killed: Lit by the golden evening sun, the wildebeest is dealt a fatal blow by the victorious hunters

Dinner: Wildebeest are strong and fast, but are vulnerable as soon as they are separated from the heard

Beaten down: South African photographer Mark Dumbleton said the hunt was over within minutes

'I couldn't believe the animal instinct they had,' he said. 'They knew exactly how to take [the animal] down'
