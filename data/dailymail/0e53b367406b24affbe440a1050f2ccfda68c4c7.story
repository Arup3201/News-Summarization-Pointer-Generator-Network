Mufid Elfgeeh, 30, of Rochester, faced accusations in court that he illegally bought guns to shoot and kill members of the U.S. military returning from Iraq

A New York food market owner has been accused of plotting to kill U.S. soldiers returning from action overseas and Muslims from a rival sect over Syria's civil war.

Yemeni-born businessman Mufid Elfgeeh, 30, allegedly bought two handguns and two silencers to launch vengeance attacks against U.S. armed forces and Shiites.

Elfgeeh, from Rochester, was arrested on Saturday when he tried to buy the firearms from an FBI informant, federal authorities said.

He faces two counts of receiving and possessing an unregistered firearm silencer.

No plea was entered during a court appearance Monday. Public defender Mark Hosken, who was appointed to handle the case, was not available for comment.

The investigation included linking Elfgeeh's home computer to tweets from alias Twitter accounts expressing support for Al Qaida, violent holy war and Sunni insurgent groups in Syria, according to court papers.

The FBI gave an informant a Walther PPK .32-caliber handgun and a Glock 26, 9 mm handgun, both with functional silencers affixed to the barrels, two boxes of .32-caliber ammunition, and two boxes of 9-millimeter ammunition, according to the affidavit.

Elfgeeh, a naturalized U.S. citizen who operates Halal Mojo and Food Mart in Rochester, paid the informant $1,050 in the transaction completed on Saturday afternoon and was immediately arrested for possession of the silencers not registered in his name.

U.S. Attorney William Hochul said yesterday that Elfgeeh faces 10 years in prison for each silencer and the possibility of a $250,000 fine.

Elfgeeh frequently used Twitter to tweet and retweet messages expressing support for various terrorist groups and holy war, seeking donations to assist fighters in Syria, and praising Al Qaida as 'our only savior,' authorities said.

According to an FBI affidavit, a government informant taped a December conversation with Elfgeeh in which he stated: 'I'm thinking about doing something here to be honest with you.

'I'm thinking about just go buy a big automatic gun from off the street or something and a lot of bullets and just put on a vest or whatever and just go around and start shooting.'

Authorities said Elfgeeh changed his plans in March to killing returning soldiers, and he said in a taped conversation with an informant that he planned to act alone: 'It could be right now in the daytime, and I could be ... like this guy here or something ... I could just go back and wait for him to when he leave to go to his garage, and just walk up slowly, boom, boom, boom, inside his garage.'

When an informant asked him whether he was going to release a video message of his attacks, Elfgeeh responded: 'Once we do five or ten already, 15, something like that ... then we gonna say something,' according to the affidavit.

Even though Elfgeeh used the word 'we,' most of his comments indicated he intended to act alone and not immediately.

The FBI said it had been investigating Elfgeeh since early last year.

In an appearance Monday before a federal magistrate, Elfgeeh was appointed a lawyer from the Federal Public Defender's Office and was sent to Monroe County Jail.

A bail hearing has been scheduled for June 16.
