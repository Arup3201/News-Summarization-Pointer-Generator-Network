Twenty years after Sir James Dyson invented the bagless vacuum cleaner, his firm has launched a machine that never needs to have its filter cleaned.

The company has spent six years working on the Dyson Cinetic, which it says will work without losing suction for at least ten years.

Dyson claims it has improved its famous cyclone technology to reduce the amount of dust that gets stuck in the filter, meaning it no longer needs to be replaced or even cleaned, but still maintains its performance.

Revolutionary: How the Dyson vacuum cleaner will be able to run for 10 years without its filters being cleaned

The machine goes on sale tomorrow for £419 to £469, depending on the number of add-on accessories.

Sir James described the development as the most significant since it removed the bag from the vacuum cleaner in 1993.

Britain is falling behind the rest of the world because it is not training enough engineers, Sir James Dyson said yesterday.

The inventor, right, whose firm now makes all its products in Malaysia and Singapore, said expertise and technology no longer exists for high-tech production in the UK.

Speaking on US television, he said: ‘One of the reasons we do this in Singapore, which is a very expensive country, is because we have all the support for the robots and the automated equipment there which we wouldn’t have in England.

‘Unfortunately, we have to have this factory in Singapore... The problem is manufacturing has drifted away so fast [in Britain] we have lost the skills to make things.’

Sir James, whose firm still carries out its research and development in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, said he was trying to address the lack of engineers in the UK by funding programmes at universities including Oxford, Cambridge, Manchester and Imperial College, London.

He added: 'Getting rid of bags solved the frustration of my vacuum losing suction.

‘Washing filters – or worse, buying them – is still a nuisance. Dyson Cinetic cyclones are so efficient at separating microscopic particles that everything gets thrust into the bin, and you can forget about fussy filters.’

The firm said a team of 29 engineers went through 50 versions of the technology, with 2,000 prototypes and at a cost of £7.5million, before perfecting the system.

They found that by shrinking the cone-shaped cyclones inside the cleaner – and having more of them – they could increase the power of the centrifugal force generated, sending more dust straight into the waste container and leaving less to float on to the filters.

The new DC54 model has 54 cyclones, compared to 14 larger ones in the best-selling £330 DC39.

Each cone works like a chimney, with the clean air escaping up out of the centre, and the dust and dirt being flung to the outside of the cones and out of the hole at the bottom.

One problem the engineers faced was that the smaller cones were more likely to clog with dust.

So they developed a flexible rubber section at the bottom of each cone that oscillates and vibrates with the airflow, ensuring all the particles are pushed through.

Alex Knox, Dyson’s director of engineering, said: ‘We know people don’t wash their filters. With no maintenance, the filter slowly blocks, the machine loses suction and your machine’s performance drops.’
