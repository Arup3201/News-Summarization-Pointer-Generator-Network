Each piece takes Catherine more than 100 hours to draw and she shares every inking with her 127,000 Instagram followers.

The Brisbane-based artist started drawing full time two years ago when she reflected on her life.

Catherine said, 'I didn't have much to show for the 24 years I'd been around so I made a promise to myself to draw full time for one year.'

That promise to herself led to her dropping out of her architecture degree and vowing to return to studies if she didn't sell one drawing in the year.

Two months later, Catherine knew she would never return to university after she had her first major sale.

Luxury brands and crumpled designer bags feature heavily in CJ's art and have become part of her identity as an artist.

'I'm captivated by the allure of luxury. There's something special about seeing something which should be perfect looking not so perfect,' she said.

Despite not planning her drawings, she spends between 12 and 15 hours a day working on her art.

'Instagram has been a huge tool for me.'

'There's a large art following on there and people saw and shared my work through Instagram.'

'It was through there I had my first major break.'
