It is such stuff as a football fan's dreams are made on – being pulled from the crowd to replace an injured player and scoring a crucial last-minute goal.

For 20-year-old Sarah Crilly, the dream came true when she was asked to pull on the Scotland jersey as she sat in the stands watching the national women's team play.

Miss Crilly was a spectator at the game against Norway in which Scotland, having already been hit by two late call-offs, suffered a series of injuries. When yet another player was carried off, with only ten minutes to go, Miss Crilly was  summoned to the dressing room.

Great Scot! In boots two sizes too big Sarah Crilly, wearing number 14, bears down on goal before equalising for Scotland against Norway

She took to the pitch in borrowed boots two sizes too big – and three pairs of socks to ensure they stayed on – yet kept her nerve to score the equaliser as Scotland trailed 2-1.

Miss Crilly, of Carluke, Lanarkshire, said: 'I was there for a day out with my friends and the next thing I know I'm stepping on the park. It was crazy. I couldn't believe it when I scored. It was incredible.'

She has been playing football since she was three and has been with Hamilton Ladies since she was 11.

She has played for the  Scotland under-17 and under-19 teams and had been helping out the full squad in training.

Miss Crilly was then invited to the 
friendly at Dunfermline's East End Park last Thursday ahead of two 
crucial Euro 2013 qualifiers against Wales and France later this month.

She said: 'I was standing with my friends waiting on a cup of tea when the team administrator came up and asked if I had my boots with me. I didn't. So she took me to the changing room and got me kitted out.

'The shorts were way too big and baggy and I was wearing three pairs of socks. I must have looked ridiculous.'

Miss Crilly, who studies sport at Stirling University, would not  normally have been allowed to play – but the referee agreed to relax the rules as it was a friendly.

Scotland boss Anna Signeul said: 'Sarah 
was training with the players during the week but she wasn't in the 
squad – so we asked if she could play because we were a player short. 
I'm very pleased with her – the first ever game with the  A-squad and 
she scores.'

Hamilton Ladies manager Kevin Murphy said: 'I wasn't aware Sarah was even at the game.

I was at work and got an email from someone at the game to say she'd come on as a sub.

As you can imagine, I was quite surprised.

'For her to score the equaliser is fantastic – and it's thoroughly deserved.

'She works so hard and deserves the recognition.'

Miss Crilly said: 'I want to finish university and find a rewarding career but a chance to play pro football is everything – that is the ultimate goal.'

Her mother Moira, 57, said: 'We are so proud of her, she works so hard.

'Since she could walk, she has always had a ball at her feet.'
