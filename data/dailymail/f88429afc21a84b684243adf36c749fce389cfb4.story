With their beaks touching, this pair of swans appear to be kissing as their slender necks form a perfect heart shape.

The duo could have swum out of a romantic card as they formed the loving symbol at their home at the Abbotsbury Swannery in Dorset.

And after sharing their 'kiss', the birds at the sanctuary, near Weymouth, were only to happy to pose up cheek to cheek on their idyllic pond.

Love birds: These swans appeared to be coming over all romantic as they formed a perfect heart shape at the Abbotsbury Swannery in Dorset

Home to a colony of around 600 nesting Mute Swans, the Swannery was originally set up by the Benedictine monks who built their monastery at Abbotsbury during the 1040s.

Originally the swans were farmed to produce food for the monks' lavish banquets, and when the monastery was destroyed by Henry VIII in 1539, they Swannery came under the stewardship of Ilchester Estates, which still oversees it today.

Unlike most British swans, these are not owned by the Queen as they were sold by Henry VIII to Sir Giles Strangways, Earl of Ilchester.

Heart to heart: The birds are among the 600 who live at the Swannery, which is the world's only only managed colony of Mute Swans.

The sanctuary is home to the world's only managed colony of Mute Swans.

As well as being a popular tourist destination the Swannery is also popular with film makers due to its natural wildlife habitat, and was used as a location for Harry Potter And The Half Blood Prince.

Every July the swans moulting feathers renders them flightless for around six weeks, anabling them to be rounded up, weighed and measured.

Any swans that are new to the colony are ringed as part of the round-up, which involves around 50 canoes
 driving the birds into a lagoon where they are checked over and given 
inoculations before being released back into the wild.
