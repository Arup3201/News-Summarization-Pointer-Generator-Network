Women who suffered horrific acid attacks in Pakistan - often for doing nothing more than spurning a man's advances - have found themselves shunned by society and struggling to find work as result of their facial disfigurement.

Now a surgeon from a British clinic hopes he can help them improve their appearance and rebuild their lives by giving them pioneering hair transplants. 

Surgeon Asim Shahmalak, 53, from Cheadle, Greater Manchester, has spent £50,000 of his own money performing reconstructive surgery on six women who have been disfigured.

Dr Shahmalak said some of the victims were attacked with sulphuric acid which can be bought for as little as 15p a bottle on the back streets of Karachi where the women live.

Shockingly, one six-year-old girl had been doused with acid by her father for refusing to go to school but was still too young for Dr Shahmalak to help. 

One of the women he was able to treat was Kanwal Ashar, 24, who had acid thrown over her by a man who had been stalking her after she had turned down his proposal.

She had been working in a beauty salon and the man became obsessed with her.

Dr Shahmalak gave her two new eyebrows and a right eyelash with hair transplanted for the back of her head in a series of intricate operations performed over three days.

She had struggled to find work since the attack four years ago and she hopes that the surgery will help rebuild her life.

She told Dr Shahmalak: 'I can go to a wedding now and show my face now I have got my eyebrows back. You have changed my life.'

Kanwal Qayum, 27, was doused in acid after telling a jealous former friend that she was starting a new job as an air hostess.

He attacked her in her sleep and she has previously had extensive surgery on her face and neck as she recovers from her wounds.

She had previously had eyebrows tattooed on her face with ink, but Dr Shahmalak gave her two permanent new brows and a right eyebrow from hair harvested from the back of her scalp.

Asma Fayyaz, 23, was horrifically scarred three years ago after falling into a pan of boiling fat when she slipped in her kitchen.

She had a new right eyebrow and a right eyelash transplanted by Dr Shahmalak and his team from Crown Clinic, based in Manchester. 

Mona Bhatti, 42, has also been given new eyebrows. She was shunned by Pakistani society after having a sex change operation. Born a man, she was splattered with acid while begging on the streets after changing sex to a woman.

Dr Shahmalak is one of only nine surgeons in the world qualified to do the kind of intricate eyelash and eyebrow transplants the women needed.

He performed the first eyelash transplant in the UK on a Manchester woman back in 2009. 

As well as carrying out the transplants in Karachi, he helped train local doctors and technicians in his techniques so that his work could carry on at local hospitals on his return to Britain. 

Last week, the doctor returned to Karachi to meet the women and review all the surgery he had performed last year.

He said: 'It was wonderful to meet the women again and see how their lives had been improved by the surgery.

'I wept when I first heard what had happened to them. Their stories were heartbreaking - scarred for life because you want to better yourself and work as an air hostess.

'Doused with acid because you turned down a man's proposal - people were better treated in the Middle Ages.

'It was incredibly moving to see the smiles on their faces after we performed the surgery. They had given up hope of ever getting help because the Government in Pakistan cannot afford to do anything for them. We were their last hope.

'They are not accepted by society because of their disfigurement. They cannot get jobs and, in some case, they have been disowned by their families and left to beg on the streets.

'They are too frightened of reprisals to tell the police who has attacked them and even if they did, they have no faith that the culprits will be brought to justice.'

Dr Shahmalak, a former NHS general surgeon, said that he had investigated the availability of sulphuric acid while he was in Karachi and found it could be bought for as little as 15p a bottle near to where he performed surgery on the women.

He said: 'It easy to buy with no questions asked. And as long as the authorities turn a blind eye to horrific cases like these, the attacks will continue.'

Dr Shahmalak, a father-of-two, worked with the Karachi-based charity Smile Again which had found patients needing surgery.

They have identified five new cases who the doctor will return to treat later this year.

He said: 'There is so much more work to do. I am just glad that I am able to make a difference to these women's lives.'
