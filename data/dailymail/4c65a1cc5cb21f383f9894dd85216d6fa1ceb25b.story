Traumatised: Vincent Cooke who stabbed a burglar to death in self-defence

A homeowner who stabbed a burglar to death has spoken of how the terrifying night has destroyed his life and he has been left dependent on a cocktail of medication to help deal with the trauma.

Vincent Cooke, 40, was confronted on his doorstep by two thugs who then forced their way into his £350,000 home in the Cheshire stockbroker belt last year.

In the struggle that ensued, Mr Cooke grabbed a carving knife to protect himself and fatally stabbed 37-year-old robber Raymond Jacob.

Earlier this month a judge sentenced his accomplice Michael Thorpe, 34, to ten years in jail for aggravated burglary.

Last night Mr Cooke, who now suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, described how the terrifying confrontation last September has ruined his life.

'If you'd said to me a year ago that I would kill a man, I would never had believed it.'

Mr Cooke is now on anti-depressants, sleeping tablets, beta-blockers and painkillers to help him deal with the terrifying ordeal.

'I used to love coming home from work and preparing dinner for my family. Now I can’t even see a knife without recoiling.'

He said that if we watches a TV programme with blood in, he will suffer from nightmares, waking up screaming and sweating.

He explained he can go without sleep for days, mulling over what would have happened if he had done something differently.

Mr Cooke, a boss of a courier firm, said he is desperate to go back to work, but is currently too tired to return.

After the stabbing Mr Cooke, who said he acted in lawful self defence, was questioned for 12 hours and later released without charge but was kept on bail for almost a month until he was told he would not be charged.

He and his family have since left their luxury home after suffering nightmares about the tragedy and have only just returned six weeks ago.

Mr Cooke had been at his his £350,000 home in Bramhall, near Stockport, Greater Manchester, last September watching an evening film when he heard the door bell ring.

He thought it was his wife Karen, his wife of 14 years, returning from picking up their 13-year-old son Anthony from a friend's house.

He described how he joked in high-pitched voice 'Who is it?' and the answer was 'Gas.'

Mr Cooke said the door buckled as it was kicked in and the men who had had hoods over their faces demanded to know where his wife and son were and told him they knew he had money in a safe as well as jewellery and a Rolex.

Mr Cooke was surprised at the level of detail the men knew about his life, but at the trial it emerged that the raiders had been given information about Mr Cooke’s safe from the victim’s uncle who helped him run a transport storage firm.

After being frogmarched around the four-bedroom home to look for valuables, Mr Cooke was opening the safe when Karen and his son Anthony, 13, returned home and stumbled on the robbery.

Mrs Cooke who is also now on anti-depressants and suffers panic attacks, recalled: 'Vinnie shouted at me, "We are being robbed. There are two of them. They have knives. Get out.’"I grabbed Anthony, screaming, and ran to a neighbour, who called 999.'

Mr Cooke said that was when Jacob started to attack him and lunged at him with a knife.

He managed to twist away from him and grabbed a kitchen knife from a set left on the windowsill.

He recalled: 'I didn’t choose the carving knife — but in a way I am pleased I did or it would be me that was dead.'

Mr Cooke -  who was also stabbed in the scuffle -  said he knew he had nicked him a couple of times, but due to the thick jacket Jacob was wearing he was not sure if it had just gone into the material.

During the trial the court heard Mr Cooke explained 'I felt like I was now fighting for my life, if I did not stab him first he would stab and kill me.'

Mr Cooke managed to break free but then heard screaming and saw Jacob fighting for his life and dialled 999.

Paramedics were unable to revive Jacob and he was declared dead at the scene.

Thorpe was arrested later after a neighbour spotted him fleeing the scene in a Citroen Berlingo and made a note of the registration plate.

He later claimed he and Jacob had been invited into the house by Mr Cooke to discuss a business deal importing trainers, but a violent row broke out and Jacob was killed.

During the trial Mark Kellet, prosecuting said: 'In a victim impact statement from Karen it said stress and anxiety had been caused to the whole family caused by having men in the house.

'It had an effect in terms of mental health and a financial impact and impacted Anthony in particular and they had to move out of the area at a time when Anthony was involved in GCSE’s. Moving away from family and friends has a significant impact on him and what happened to his house.'

Jacob had dozens of convictions for burglary, robbery and theft.

He once served an 18-month prison sentence for beating a man unconscious and leaving him looking 'like a piece of meat'.

In a statement issued at the time he was vindicated Mr Cooke said: 'I hope to now be able to get on with my life but will never forget the day that I had to fight for my life.

'I just want to get my life back on track. I’m still very traumatised by what happened. I’m still having nightmares every night about this incident.'

Earlier this month a judge sentenced his accomplice Micheal Thorpe to ten years in jail for aggravated burglary.

Passing sentence, Judge Mushtaq Khokhar told Thorpe: 'For anyone who lends themselves to an enterprise of this nature, it would be perfectly obvious that you would scare the victim with a knife by brandishing it and it was foreseeable that it might be used.

'It is natural to put up a fight, that is what happened in the kitchen, the complainant came upon a knife, not surprisingly in the kitchen, and sought to defend himself and his property and it was after that struggle between the two men that your accomplice was stabbed.'Judge Mushtaq Khokhar

'It is natural to put up a fight, that is what happened in the kitchen, the complainant came upon a knife, not surprisingly in the kitchen, and sought to defend himself and his property and it was after that struggle between the two men that your accomplice was stabbed.'

He added: 'It was a sad loss of life but at the same time if you embark upon unlawful enterprise with all the risks that are attached, serious injuries can occur.'
