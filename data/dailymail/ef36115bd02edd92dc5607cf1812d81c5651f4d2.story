These artworks are so beautiful you may be forgiven for thinking they’ve been meticulously painted by hand.

In fact they are the result of a computer algorithm and contain up to almost 17 million different colours, with each pixel being a different colour to the one next to it.

Called ‘rainbow smoke’, the designs and software were created by Hungarian programmer Jozsef Fejes as part of an online competition.

An online contest, set up by Programming Puzzles and Code Golf Stack Exchange recently challenged coders to create images where every pixel was a different colour. It was won by Hungarian Jozsef Fejes for his algorithm that created 'rainbow smoke' designs, pictured

The contest was set up by Programming Puzzles and Code Golf Stack Exchange. 

It challenged coders to create images where each pixel was a unique colour, with no colours being repeated and no colours missing. 

The images had to be created using just algorithms, cover at least 256 x 128 pixels and use all the 15-bit RGB system - a total of 32,768 individual hues. However, coders could make larger pictures if they wanted to.

A pixel in the RGB system is made up of three bytes for red, green and blue. This is where the name 'RGB' comes from. Each colour then has different intensity levels of green, blue and red light.

Fejes' images began using the 15-bit RGB colours, but his algorithm was also capable of creating up to 24-bit RGB images, which contain a total of 16,777,216 colours.

Each image, or range of images, were then put to a public vote, which Fejes, also known as fejescoco, won with 144 votes.

The images had to be created using just algorithms, cover at least 256 x 128 pixels and use all the colours in RGB 24-bit images - up to 16,777,216 colours. Each colour in a pixel is made up of different intensity levels of green, blue and red light, for example

Fejes' final full-size pieces cover 4096 x 4096 pixels. The images pictured are compressed so don't display all the colours. The view also varies depending on the number of pixels a screen can handle - for example, it will look different on a phone to a laptop to a high-definition TV

Fejes’ program works by plotting a single colour before placing a similar colour next to it, based on intensity levels of light in each colour.

In some of his images, the program picked a colour at random, in others the program plotted all the variations of reds, oranges, yellows, and so on, in sequence.

‘At first I didn't really know if it was going to end up looking beautiful or not, it was just an interesting programming challenge for me,’ Fejes told New Scientist. ‘I was very surprised at how beautiful it turned out to be.’

Although the contest said entrants had to cover at least 256 x 128 pixels, Fejes' final full-size pieces cover 4096 x 4096.

These images are compressed versions so don’t display all the colours.

The view also varies depending on the number of pixels the screen can handle - for example, it will look slightly different on a phone to a laptop to a high-definition TV.
