In the week since Manny Pacquiao dominated and dismantled Chris Algieri over 12 lop-sided rounds in Macau, the clamour for him to fight Floyd Mayweather Jnr has reached unprecedented levels.

Pacquiao stoked the flames by dutifully calling out Mayweather to anyone who would listen and his promoter Bob Arum quickly followed suit, as he had done with gusto in the build up.

The WBC, whose welterweight and light-middleweight titles Mayweather holds, then claimed they will do whatever they can to make the fight despite having ranked the pair as No 1 and No 2 for the last year without installing Pacquiao as Mayweather's mandatory challenger.

'If Mayweather retires without defeating Pacquiao, the question about being the best in the world will linger,' said president Mauricio Sulaiman.

'There is no fight in this decade that has been expected for so long.'

Indeed, it is now five years since the fight first captured the imagination after Pacquiao stopped Miguel Cotto in 2009. Las Vegas bookmakers immediately installed him as the favourite to beat Mayweather.

But rows over drug testing, purse splits and promotional disputes have almost strangled the life out of the so-called 'Fight of the Century'.

On Thursday, promoter Oscar De La Hoya tweeted: 'I'm prepared to put up the biggest guarantee in sports history to give the fans The Fight.'

That followed reports in the Philippines that Mayweather would be guaranteed $100million with Pacquiao pocketing $80m were they to finally touch gloves.

But amid all the commotion, one man has remained silent; Mayweather himself.

In fact, when he commented on the fight last month, he rubbished comments from his dad and trainer Floyd Snr that the two would finally meet in the ring.

'Well my father is totally wrong... the best thing for Pacquiao to do is be quiet before he really gets exposed,' he said.

'They're bringing up my name to sell tickets. All you've got to do is look at his [pay-per-view] numbers that he did on his last couple of fights and look at my numbers.'

And his numbers are certainly impressive.

While Pacquiao managed around 750,000 pay-per-view buys for his rematch with Timothy Bradley, Mayweather regularly hits the million mark.

He was also named the richest sportsman in the world in 2013 by Forbes magazine having earned $105million for just two fights, against Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez and Marcos Maidana.

Reports in the Philippines stated that Pacquiao would pocket $80m if the pair were to finally touch gloves

He could replicate that over the next 12 months from his final two fights on his Showtime television contract, expected to take place in May and September next year.

Another two victories would take 'Money' to 49-0, an identical record to legendary heavyweight Rocky Marciano.

Is he willing to risk that against Pacquiao?

Even if he is, Mayweather's relationship with key promoters remains a barrier.

Mayweather, according to the reports, would earn $100 million if he were to fight Pacquiao

His bi-annual fights are broadcast on Showtime in the United States while Pacquiao's are broadcast on HBO.

Both networks are believed to be ready to show the fight simultaneously, as they did with Mike Tyson against Lennox Lewis in 2002.

But HBO have a deal with De La Hoya's Golden Boy and he hopes to schedule Alvarez's prospective fight with Miguel Cotto on the May date normally reserved for Mayweather.

And in the same Fight Hype interview, Mayweather said: 'Oscar De La Hoya has always been disloyal; very disloyal... De La Hoya is a piece of s***. Oscar is a snake!'

The Filipino fighter was given a hero's welcome on his return to his home country this week 

But that hurdle pales into insignificance when compared to Mayweather's feud with Arum.

Having signed him to his Top Rank company after the 1996 Olympics, Arum promoted Mayweather for the best part of a decade until he struck out on his own following a disagreement over how he was being marketed.

And a year ago, Mayweather said the Pacquiao fight will never happen 'because I will never do business with Bob Arum again.'

He also told Pacquiao to leave Top Rank if he wants the fight to take place but the Filipino recently signed a new deal to take him through to 2016 and likely his retirement to the Senate in his homeland.

That leaves public pressure and the hope that Mayweather's ego relents for long enough for him to agree to what would be the richest fight in history.

For as straightforward as his victory over Alvarez was last year, few disagreed that it was a good test even if it came slightly too early for the young Mexican.

Maidana then surprised many with his performance but there was little doubt about the result at the final bell. The rematch served only to allow Mayweather to notch another fight on his Showtime bedpost.

And as the world waits for the next lucky winner of the 'Mayweather lottery', there is a diminishing list of names who would provide credible opposition.

Bolton's Amir Khan, who 12 months ago was so sure he would face Mayweather that he scrapped a fight with then world champion Devon Alexander, remains on the shortlist.

But first, ironically, he must beat Alexander in Las Vegas on December 13.

Khan aside, only Danny Garcia, currently operating at light-welterweight, stands out but he would not bring the razzmatazz that both Khan and Pacquiao guarantee.

Whether Mayweather cares remains to be seen.
