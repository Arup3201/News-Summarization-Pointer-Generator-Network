Trapped in a snow cave: Nicole Sutton sent a series of desperate text messages to rescuers while stranded next to her dead boyfriend's body on a New Zealand mountain, but died hours after they arrived

A mountain climber sent a series of desperate last texts to police saying she feared she wouldn't make the night after getting trapped in a snow cave next to her dead boyfriend's body.

Nicole Sutton, 29, and her 31-year-old boyfriend Hiroki Ogawa became stranded in blizzard conditions near the top of Mt Taranaki in New Zealand.

Rescuers knew exactly where they were, but gale-force winds made it almost impossible to reach them.

When they were finally able to make it, they found Miss Sutton barely alive beside the body of her boyfriend, who had perished during the night.

Medics fought desperate to save Miss Sutton, but she died in their arms.

Early
today, their bodies were flown down from the mountain as her father, 
Keith Sutton, told of the tragic series of text messages his daughter 
had sent.

He revealed he had sent just one to Miss Sutton, but told her to remain in touch with police to conserve her battery.

‘We
knew that Nicole didn’t think she'd survive the night based on the 
texts the night before and based on her assessment, I had no reason to 
think I knew any better,’ he said.

‘So
this morning (Monday), I faced the reality that our daughter wasn’t 
with us - only to find out she was, and then she wasn’t.’

Several
attempts had been made to reach the couple - who had buried themselves 
into a snow cave against the bitter conditions - by helicopter and by 
rescue teams on foot, but the treacherous weather was against them.

Finally a climbing team reached the cave, finding them close together in waist-deep snow.

Mr Ogawa was dead, but Miss Sutton, who the team had heard crying out for help, was conscious.

Died together: Miss Sutton with Hiroki Ogawa who were said by friends to be the love of each other's life

Hardly had they reached her and she had been able to talk to them when she lapsed into unconsciousness. Several hours of medical treatment failed to save her.

‘I’m thankful that Nicole was able to speak to the searchers,’ said her father. ‘Anybody who’s a parent will know what that’s like,’ he told the New Zealand Herald.

‘But the circumstances in which that occurred, they were good circumstances, with people doing their job and doing the best they could.

‘We respect the people who have given us information about those brief moments that they had with Nicole.

‘The fact she knew that Hiroki had died was important to me because for a moment I thought maybe she didn’t know what had happened. So that was a relief to me.’

Miss Sutton and Mr Hiroki met two years ago and were said by friends to be the love of each other’s life. Miss Sutton’s parents said they expected the pair would marry.

They met after Mr Ogawa, who is from Tokyo, moved to New Zealand where began working as a tutor and lecturer in geography and earth science before beginning a research fellowship investigating the impact of sea-levels on Pacific islands.

Miss Sutton, who was working with an environmental planning and design consultancy, was an accomplished skier but did not have the same climbing experience as her boyfriend.

The paper reported that when the couple realised they could not make it back down the mountain,  on the west coast of the North Island safely when bad weather set in, they dug a trench in the snow, climbed in and huddled together.

Mr Sutton said Mr Ogawa was an experienced mountaineer and had been up Mt Taranaki on many occasions.

‘Hiroki has done training with other people. He goes off to mountains to be in snow caves for the weekend. That’s what he does. So I’d say he’s probably done hundreds.’

A break in the weather allowed rescue teams to fly into the area by helicopter early today and winch the couple’s bodies from the mountain in an operation that took about an hour.
