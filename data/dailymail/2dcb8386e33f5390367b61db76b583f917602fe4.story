David Cameron was today forced to defend another u-turn as the government ditched plans for minimum alcohol pricing.

The Prime Minister had championed the idea of setting unit price to curb cheap booze deals but faced a Cabinet revolt, with senior ministers warning it would hit the poorest people hardest.

Multi-buy offers will also not be banned but there will be a ban on the sale of alcoholic drinks priced below the level of duty and VAT, to the fury of some MPs.

It is the latest in a string of policy reversal's ordered by Mr Cameron since he became Prime Minister.

The Home Office carried out a consultation on a 45p minimum unit price earlier this year.

It would mean a can of strong lager could not be sold for less than £1.56 and a bottle of wine for less than £4.22.

The list of government u-turns now runs to more than 40 since the coalition was formed in May 2010.

In the early days ministers tried to argue that it was a sign of strength to admit when they got things wrong.

But strategists feared too many reversals risked looking weak.

Major policies floated and then ditched by David Cameron include:

But today Home Office Minister Jeremy 
Browne said there was not enough ‘concrete evidence’ that the move would
reduce the level of problem drinking without hitting people who drink 
responsibly.

Mr Browne also
ruled out a ban on multi-buy promotions due to a ‘lack of convincing 
evidence’ that it would have a significant effect on consumption.

The main change which will go ahead will see a ban on selling alcohol below the value of alcohol duty and VAT.

It will come into effect in England and Wales by spring 2014 and will mean ordinary strength lager will not be sold for less than around 40p.

However, Tory MPs condemned the decision.
Backbencher Tracey Crouch said the decision left the UK ‘dangerously 
lagging behind’ other countries when it came to public health.

Mr Cameron defended the u-turn, coming
days after the government also dropped plans to force tobacco firms to 
sell cigarettes in plain packaging.

Speaking
in Downing Street the Prime Minister said: ‘We are introducing today 
what is effectively a minimum price because we are saying it's going to 
be illegal to sell alcohol below the rate of duty plus VAT.

‘So supermarkets or shops deeply discounting alcohol will be made illegal. That, I think, will be a positive step forward.’

Curbs: Minimum alcohol pricing has been dropped but retailers will be banned from selling booze below the cost of duty and VAT

Mr Cameron added that there were arguments with ‘a lot of merit’ in favour of a minimum price but there were also problems.

‘There's
a degree of legal uncertainty - it's been introduced in Scotland but 
it's still under legal challenge - and there's also question marks about
the evidence behind it and how well it can work.

‘So,
when we have more evidence about how it can work and when we've got 
more certainty about the legal issues I think it's an idea that has 
merit, that I'll be happy to consider again.’

He stressed that the decision had been made ‘by me as Prime Minister’, as had the shelving of plans for cigarettes in plain packaging.

It follows claims by Labour that new Tory election guru Lynton Crosby, a lobbyist who counts tobacco giant Philip Morris as a client, had influenced the public health policy u-turns.

Backlash: Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, a former GP, said doctors wanted to see minimum pricing introduced while Tracey Crouch (right) warned the u-turn would cost lives

But Mr Cameron said: ‘In the end the buck stops absolutely here. These are both decisions that I have made, I think they are the right ones because we need the evidence base, we need the legal certainty and then we can move ahead.

‘But until then it makes sense not to move ahead.’

However in the Commons Tory MPs lined up to criticise the decision to abandon minimum alcohol pricing.

Miss Crouch told Mr Browne: 'Scientific studies show a clear positive impact between introducing minimum pricing and alcohol-related deaths.

'Does this not show that the decision to delay minimum alcohol pricing today leaves us dangerously lagging behind in terms of public health policy, which will ultimately cost lives?'

Dr Sarah Wollaston, a former GP, said: 'Doctors up and down this country who are fed up with being lectured on how to reduce avoidable mortality within the NHS see the one tool they are asking for that could reduce avoidable mortality in liver disease taken away.'

Tory MP Andrew Griffiths was also angry at the decision to drop the policy. He said supermarkets would still be able to undercut pubs which served reputable customers.
