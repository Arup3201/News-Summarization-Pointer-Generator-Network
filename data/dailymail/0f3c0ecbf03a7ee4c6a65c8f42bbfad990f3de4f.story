Shane Geraghty has become England's forgotten man in recent seasons but the London Irish No 10 delivered a sweetly struck drop goal to snatch victory over Exeter at the Madejski Stadium yesterday.

The Exiles looked buried towards the end of a scrappy contest but, with the clock in red, Geraghty converted from 30 metres to secure his side's second win in nine games.

It prompted calls from director of rugby Brian Smith for the 28-year-old to be handed an international recall, having gone off the radar since emerging as the next big thing in 2007.

'There are very few ball players who want to step up like that,' said Smith. 'It shows the class of the player to get us home at the death. He's definitely international class and I wouldn't swap him for another ball player in the league.

'A lot of things came his way early and easily. He was a prodigious talent but he's a better player now than when he got his chances for England. If Shane was at a top-four club, everyone would be behind him. He hasn't changed as a player but he's matured a lot as a person.'

Geraghty's last Test was against New Zealand in 2009, but the playmaker has not given up on his international ambitions.

'I spoke to Stuart (Lancaster, the England coach) before the autumn and he said to just keep playing well,' said Geraghty. 'There are a lot of talented players in that 10 position, so I'm not expecting a call-up any time soon in that regard. But I still think I can offer something at 12 or even off the bench.'

Irish have been unable to generate any momentum this season and Geraghty's late three points ended a losing streak at the Madejski dating back to September. Exeter, too, are woefully out of form.

The opening quarter was littered with the sort of mistakes you expect from two struggling sides, with silly cross-field kicks and fluffed passes undoing any good work.

Promising Chiefs youngster Henry Slade rattled the left upright with a fifth-minute penalty and it remained scoreless until the 20th minute, when Gareth Steenson kicked the opening points. But the hosts hit back and, off a 12-man driving maul, flanker Blair Cowan touched down.

Exeter's lineout struggled but the boot of Steenson kept the scoreboard ticking, edging his side back in front. Their opening try was as much down to Irish inaccuracies as it was to Exeter precision, with Alex Lewington sloppily knocking on before lock Dean Mumm dived over.

Having trailed at half-time, three tries in 12 second-half minutes from Tom Guest, Lewington and Cowan secured the bonus point and put the hosts back ahead.

Exeter's response came through a close-range Dave Ewers try, but the reliable boot of Tom Homer kept the Exiles on course for a rare win. The Chiefs rallied with two penalties from Steenson but, as Chiefs defenders charged towards him, up stepped Geraghty with the perfect kick.

It leaves Exeter in fifth position and director of rugby Rob Baxter admits his side need to snap back into life if they want to keep up their play-off challenge. 'We're going through that period where a win is proving tough to find,' said Baxter. 'It can be difficult to break the cycle. There will be some brutal honesty.'
