Two U.S. students survived a week lost in
a blizzard-hit New Zealand mountain range by taking regular dips in hot
thermal springs they had stumbled across, rescuers said today.

Alec Brown and Erica Klintworth, both 21,
had planned a two-day trek on the South Island's rugged West Coast but 
ended up spending more than a week in the wilderness after a snowstorm 
hit.

They survived by rationing their meagre supplies of peanut butter and rice and eventually walked to safety after nine days.

The two students, on a foreign study program in New Zealand with University of Wisconsin Stevens Point, had planned to hike and camp for a few days at some hot springs.

Survival: Alec Brown and his girlfriend Erica Klintworth survived for nine days on a mountain in New Zealand with only meagre supplies

But heavy rain and a snowstorm during the Southern Hemisphere winter prevented the couple from being able to cross a river and return.

'Unfortunately it rained and rained, day after day, and snowed,' Alec Brown said.

He said the nights were tough to take because the rain and sleet pounded down on the tarpaulin covering their sleeping hammock and the river roared - reminding them all the time of their predicament.

When they realised they were going to be stuck they started rationing: 'a biscuit and jelly one day,' Brown wrote 'and even less another.'

Brown's mother Lisa, of Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota, said she panicked when she first found out her son was missing.

'It's too much for a mom,' she said. 'Especially when they're that far away. I just felt so helpless.'

Inhospitable: The couple were trapped on a mountain in the Arthur's Pass National Park on New Zealand's South Island for nine days before they walked to safety while a helicopter was searching for them

She had faith that Alec, an environmental science major, knew the outdoors well enough to survive, she said, adding that Erica, who is studying graphic design, is a strong woman.

The couple's ordeal began on June 1 when friend Katie Jenkins dropped them off at a national park on the South Island's West Coast so they could hike in and camp for a few days.

'They were just going to the hot springs, to chill out and study for finals,' she said.

It was eight days before she realised they were missing and raised the alarm.

The couple didn't take much food - some carrots, rice, peanut butter and trail mix, said Police Sergeant Sean Judd, who coordinated rescue attempts.

He said that after three days, a steady rain started.

Hot springs: Alec and Erica dipped into hot pools to keep warm and slow down energy loss as they survived on the mountain for more than a week

'Then on Wednesday the snowstorm hit and it got progressively worse,' Judd said.

Alec Brown said that soaking in the hot pools 'helped keep us warm and slow energy loss.'

It wasn't until Sunday that the river finally seemed safe enough to cross again.

He prepared for their hike out by cooking up a 'good meal' of rice, marshmallows, peanut butter and chocolate, he said.

'We then left and crossed the icy waters only up to our waist,' he said. 'We were climbing the mountains under the dense tree cover when we first heard the helicopter we assumed was looking for us. The helicopter never saw us and we walked out just fine and met up with the search and rescue by the road.'

It was when they attended a debriefing, he added, that 'we found out what a big deal all this was.'

The student said he relied on his past experience hiking and camping and felt confident in the couple's ability to survive.

'I believe when you go into the bush you take your life into your own hands and need to be prepared to handle whatever conditions occur,' he said.

'We could have been more prepared, but in the end we were prepared enough to walk ourselves out.'
