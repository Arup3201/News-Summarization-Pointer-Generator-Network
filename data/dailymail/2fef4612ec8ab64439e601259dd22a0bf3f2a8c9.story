Profiting from hard times? Many items in the 
'What You Need' section of Jamie Oliver's new book come from the celebrity chef's own
range of Tefal utensils

Jamie Oliver's mission to get Britain to eat well on a budget got off to a controversial start last week when he lambasted working-class families for buying gigantic flatscreen TVs while eating junk food.

But his new austerity cookbook, which promises ‘exciting food that’s not hard on your wallet’, might not quite provide the low-cost answers hard-pressed households need.

Home cooks wanting to try all the ‘money-saving’ meals in Save With Jamie would need to spend more than £500 on kitchen utensils and food ‘staples’ before buying a single main ingredient.

In the book – which itself costs a wallet-straining £26 – Oliver lists 47 items of equipment needed for the recipes, including a griddle pan, a pestle and mortar and three different kinds of grater, which would cost at least £360.

In addition, Oliver cites a list of ‘stock cupboard essentials’, including groundnut oil, sesame oil, quinoa, organic yogurt, polenta and kaffir lime leaves.

When totalled up, the hefty shopping list of 107 foods, spices and oils would cost almost £150.

The Mail on Sunday has calculated the figures for ingredients and equipment using the cheapest alternatives available. But most of the items pictured in the ‘What You Need’ section of the book come  from the TV chef’s own range of Tefal utensils, which come at a  hefty premium.

While a basic food processor – which is required in almost 20 of  the book’s recipes – costs from £60, Oliver’s branded version costs £150.

Other items on his list include a set of three saucepans that retail at  £130, a single griddle pan at £67, three non-stick frying pans for  £95, and graters which cost up to  £20 each.

Oliver, who has long been an outspoken food campaigner, was widely condemned last week for his comments about the eating habits of working-class families, when he recalled a scene from one of his previous TV shows which, he said, showed ‘the mum and the kid eating chips and cheese out of Styrofoam containers, and behind them is a massive TV.’

‘It just didn’t weigh up.’  he added.

The interview was to promote his new Channel 4 show, Jamie’s Money Saving Meals, which starts tomorrow and is tied in with the supposedly budget cookbook.

‘Naked Chef’ Oliver, who is worth an estimated £150 million, says he is determined to demonstrate  that fresh cooking could be more economical than pre-made convenience food.

He added: ‘The fascinating thing for me is that seven times out of ten, the poorest families in this country choose the most expensive way to hydrate and feed their families: the ready meals, the convenience foods

‘I meet people who say, “You don’t understand what it’s like.” I just want to hug them and teleport them to the Sicilian street cleaner who has 25 mussels, ten cherry tomatoes, and a packet of spaghetti for 60p, and knocks out the most amazing pasta. You go to Italy or Spain and they eat well on not much money.

‘We’ve missed out on that in Britain, somehow.’

His comments were challenged by the Child Poverty Action Group, whose head of policy, Imran Hussain, said: ‘For many families it’s low income which gets in the way of healthy eating.

'As official statistics show, parents of poor children are much less likely to be able to afford fresh fruit for their children.’

Last night, a spokesman for the chef hit back at the accusations that the Save With Jamie cookbook is out of touch with the average household’s budget.

He said: ‘Jamie always puts a list of kitchen kit and store cupboard ingredients in his books as a guide for people and, in fact, we get a lot of positive feedback from readers about those pages. 

‘Of course, as it’s merely a guide, no one would be expected to buy everything at the same time and, in most cases, readers would find that they probably have a fair few of the items on the lists anyway.

‘And of course you don’t have to buy everything before attempting a recipe or three – you would only have to buy a tiny proportion of the entire list to make some delicious, affordable food which costs, on average, around £1.32 per portion.’
