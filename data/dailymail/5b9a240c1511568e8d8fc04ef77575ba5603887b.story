A new 'cocoon bed' lets slumberers enjoy a good night's sleep suspended between trees like a butterfly before it emerges from its chrysalis.

These images show the just-released Cocoon Tree hovering between trees thanks to a system of suspension wires.

It is the brainchild of Frenchman Berni Du Payrat, who says he was inspired to create it after looking at an ostrich egg, and costs between £3,000 and £9,000.

Cosy: A new 'cocoon bed' allows sleepers to experience a night of rest suspended above the ground

Floating: The pod is suspended by wires and can hold up to a tonne. The interior contains a bed that's perfect for snuggling

Doze: The inventor says the Cocoon Tree is perfect for lovers and even small families

The Cocoon Bed is made of aluminium and weighs only 130
 pounds. It is rigged up with ropes and secured by nets and can hold the
 weight of up to a tonne.

A large mattress and a custom made 
duvet can be placed inside it, accommodating two people, or even a 
couple with small children.

Berni said: 'It is just great to sleep in a cocoon. It's very romantic if you want to spend time with a partner.

'I take my girlfriend there and she loves it. It's so nice to wake up outdoors with the sun shining.

'It was a great project and I'm really pleased with the result.

'The only problem is the birds, they're so noisy when the sun comes up.'

Rise: The pod can be installed in two hours by the buyer or a professional team can do the heavy lifting

The intimate contraption, which can be assembled in less than two hours, took two years to complete  and can come in different 
forms, such as ground cocoons.

It even features air-conditioning mechanisms that can be 
powered sustainably by sun and windpower and is sheltered from the elements by a robust waterproof outer skin, with mosquito screens for the openings.

Berni says it's like having a grown-up tree house.
