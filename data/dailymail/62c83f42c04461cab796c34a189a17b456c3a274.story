A grieving pensioner has spoken of his 'devastation' after being told the ornamental stone border around his wife's grave was too big.

Joe Grant lost his wife Blanche last year after 58 years of marriage. Her health had deteriorated during an 11 year battle with Alzheimer's.

The 85-year-old, from South Shields, Tyne and Wear, now visits his wife's grave every Saturday and said he was 'proud' of the decoration including the white chippings and ornamental stone border.

But he has been left angered after the council insisted the ornamental garden was too big and not in keeping with its policy.

Mr Grant, who has tirelessly campaigned for the rights of dementia sufferers since his wife was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2001, said: 'I feel devastated - how has it taken a year for them to come to tell me about this?'

Mr Grant said he had no way of knowing the council's regulations before he built the decorative garden at Harton Cemetery in South Shields.

Mr Grant said: 'It's very sad that the council has asked me to change the grave and I'm really annoyed.

'I want Blanche to rest in peace and I'm very proud of what I've done to the grave.

'Every Saturday I go to the cemetery and chat to Blanche. It's important to me that it looks nice in honour of her.'

Mr Grant, a retired engineer for the Merchant Navy, was married to his wife, a machinist, for nearly six decades.

Too big: South Tyneside Council has said graves are only allowed to have ornamental gardens up to 3ft in length, while this one is 5ft

In December last year he was invited to Downing Street in recognition of his work in campaigning for more help for Alzheimer’s and dementia sufferers.

Today, Mr Grant said his 'wife was his life'.

He said: 'I have been her voice for all those years and I'm still her voice now.'

South Tyneside Council has stood firm in its assertion that graves are only allowed to have ornamental gardens up to 3ft in length. The ornamental garden on the grave of Mrs Jones is 5ft.

A council spokesman said: 'We very much sympathise with Mr Grant, but the Council has a responsibility to enforce the cemetery’s regulations and ensure it can be properly maintained and accessible to everyone.

'These rules are provided to everyone when a grave is purchased.

'Graves in the lawned section can have small ornamental gardens up to a maximum of 3ft in length, but in this case the decorations are 5ft in length.

'We have met with Mr Grant and will do everything we can to help him bring the area in line with regulations.'
