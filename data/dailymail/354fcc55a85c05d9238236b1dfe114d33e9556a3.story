Craig Gordon insists he has no intention of acting as understudy to Allan McGregor and David Marshall after finally winning back his Scotland place.

The Celtic goalkeeper saw his two-year injury nightmare finally come to an end this summer when he signed for the Hoops.

And the 40-cap stopper was handed an immediate recall to the Dark Blues set-up when Scots boss Gordon Strachan named him in his squad for Sunday's opening Euro 2016 qualifier with Germany.

Ambition: Craig Gordon is fighting for a starting spot after the Celtic keeper was recalled to the Scotland squad

The 31-year-old, however, is at the back of the queue to face the new world champions in Dortmund as Hull's McGregor and Marshall of Cardiff battle it out to be the nation's number one.

But former Hearts and Sunderland keeper Gordon is determined to make up for lost time and force his way back into a Scotland jersey. 

He told the Celtic View: 'It's good competition (with Allan and David) and I enjoy meeting up with the squad.

'The standard of training among the keepers is fantastic. It's been great to be involved in it and it improves my game as well.

'The next stage is to go there and try to show up well in training and demonstrate that I'm more than capable of holding my own and pushing for a start.

'I don't want to just go along there looking to make up the numbers now that I have been included in the squad.

'I want to put pressure on the other two goalkeepers and try to force myself into contention for a starting spot.

'I wanted to get back in as soon as possible and (the Germany game) was the very first opportunity. I hadn't set myself a goal to try and be in this squad. I wanted to get back in however long it took.

'Now that I have managed to get called up the next goal is to force myself on the park and getting a game.'

Gordon is Celtic's new first-choice stopper after Englishman Fraser Forster sealed a £10million switch to Southampton.

But he admits his recall to the Scotland squad - which will be without Ipswich's Christophe Berra after the defender withdrew through injury - has come earlier than he thought possible.

'It was a nice to be called back into the squad,' he said.

'I wasn't totally expecting it as I thought it might be a bit early as I have only played a few games but, nevertheless, I have done well enough in those few games to show I am back at a level that could be considered for the Scotland squad.'

Strachan's men will have the chance to emulate the famous 1967 team - which included Jim Baxter, Denis Law and Billy Bremner - that defeated England at Wembley if they can become the first side to topple the World Cup winners on Sunday.

Germany boss Joachim Low, however, is without former skipper Philipp Lahm, record-breaking frontman Miroslav Klose and Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker after the trio retired following their triumph in Brazil.

Gordon said: 'It's a fantastic opportunity to become the unofficial world champions - we have previous for that, beating the World Cup winners straight after the tournament, and hopefully it will be a chance for us to do the same.

'It will be difficult as Germany will want to put on a big show for all their fans after coming back from the World Cup.

'There will be a few new faces to come into their side and a few will have retired, so there will be a few changes there.

'It probably won't cause them too many problems as they have such great strength in depth but it could be something for us to hold on to

'They have had a pretty settled squad for the last wee while so it will give us a chance to go over there and acquit ourselves well.'

Berra, meanwhile, has been forced to pull out of Strachan's group after sustaining a knee injury in the Tractor Boys' 1-1 draw at Derby on Saturday.

Strachan has already called up Aberdeen's Mark Reynolds as cover after Berra was kept behind by Ipswich's medical team for further treatment.
