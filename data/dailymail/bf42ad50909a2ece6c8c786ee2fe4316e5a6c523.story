No need to panic: Celtic midfielder Scott Brown pictured whilst on international duty for Scotland

Scott Brown has insisted there is no need for panic over Celtic’s hunt for a new manager as he firmly backed the board to land the right man in the end.

Roy Keane’s decision to withdraw from the process on Monday ruled out the leading target of major shareholder Dermot Desmond.

The Parkhead hierarchy are now continuing to assess other candidates, with Steve Clarke currently the bookmakers’ favourite ahead of the likes of Malky Mackay, Owen Coyle and Jackie McNamara.

Celtic legend Henrik Larsson is also still believed to be under consideration - with fellow Swede Sven-Goran Eriksson also touting him as the ideal man for the job.

Despite the rumour mill going into overdrive, Brown is calm about the situation and stressed the players had every faith in those who will make the call on Neil Lennon’s successor.

‘The club will definitely get it right,’ said the Celtic captain. ‘They will find the man they want for the job and put him in place.

‘I know it seems to be dragging on in some people’s eyes, but these things take time when you are looking for the right man.

‘I’ve tried to concentrate on doing my own work, but the lads have been telling me that Roy Keane did not want to be considered for the job.

‘To be fair, he could have been a great manager, but the club know exactly what they are doing and I’m positive they will get it right.

‘The club always take their time to get it right and that is why, as players, we have full trust in them.’ Brown is currently undertaking his B coaching licence with the SFA in Largs before heading off on holiday.

Celtic return for pre-season training on June 24, ahead of an opening Champions League qualifying clash on July 15 or 16.

And Brown believes the experience within the Parkhead squad – and the remaining coaching staff – will help any new manager hit the ground running.

‘We’ll be coming back for the pre-season and the Champions League qualifiers fit and ready to go,’ he insisted.

‘It is going to be hectic and it is going to be all-on for whoever comes into the club.

‘Celtic need to be in the group stage of the Champions League and the squad knows what is required.’

While Celtic seem no closer to unveiling their new boss, Eriksson has insisted that Larsson is the only man for the Parkhead hotseat.

The former England manager, currently coaching Chinese Super League club Guangzhou R&F, has been approached by agents asking if he would put his name forward as a possible replacement for Neil Lennon.

Earning 
£2million a year in the Far East, however, 66-year-old Eriksson says 
Larsson is the outstanding candidate to take the Scottish champions 
forward.

Currently
 coaching Falkenbergs in the Swedish Allsvenskan, Larsson is believed to
 have held talks with Celtic’s major shareholder Dermot Desmond over a 
week ago, but is believed to be reluctant to break his contract.

‘Henrik is Mr Celtic - or was anyway - and has done well in Falkenberg,’ said Eriksson.

‘I think he would be an excellent choice. Absolutely.

‘How long did he play there, almost 10 years? I think it would be a very popular choice among fans. He is still the king in Scotland.’

Meanwhile, Paul Lambert expects to unveil Keane as his No 2 at Aston Villa once the Republic of Ireland assistant returns from two international friendlies in the USA next week.

In a clear indication Keane is close to agreeing a shock move to Villa Park, on Tuesday he pulled out of his role as an ITV pundit for the World Cup to concentrate on coaching.

He had been expected to be the broadcaster’s lead analyst but will instead not travel to Brazil, meaning he has more time to invest in any potential return to Premier League football.

‘Roy has been a tremendous part of our pundit team in recent years, but we fully understand his decision to concentrate wholly on his coaching,’ an ITV spokesperson said. ‘We wish him every success for the future.’
