No one knows exactly why this magnificent 1920s racing car was carefully dismantled, piece by piece, and buried under a shed.

But the amount of time and effort put into the job is likely to pale in comparison to the painstaking task of rebuilding it to its former glory.

After having been laid to rest for potentially more than half a century, the 1928 MG MK IV has not only been restored to its former grandeur but has also scooped the Best Vintage Car award at the British Classic Car Show.

The resurrected MG, similar to this 1924-27 MG, is the only survivor in the country that displays the correct coachwork

It took Fred Body, from Cheddar in Somerset, more than a year to piece together all the parts of the two-seater car. But almost everything he needed was there.

'When it was found it was completely taken apart, laid out flat and covered in gravel and one or two inches of concrete,' said car enthusiast Body who bought the parts of the car when they were put up for sale.

Speculating on why it was buried in such as way, he told the BBC: 'I think what must have happened was the war was coming and someone thought 'they're not taking my car for scrap'.

'They carefully took it apart and buried it thinking they would come back and put it together again.'

The vehicle was discovered in 1999 under a cowshed on a farm in Gloucestershire. Prior to this date, nobody knows anything about the car's history, or its previous owner.

Only 135 examples of this model of MG were made in 1928, according to the Early MG Society, and Body's restored model is the only survivor in the country that displays the correct coachwork.

Despite spending most of its days underground, most of the parts were in good order. It even had all its identification including Guarantee plate and original number plates.

Surprisingly, some of the original leather from the seats and paintwork was also preserved, meaning Body could restore it as close as possible to its original colours.

The only parts that did not survive were those made from aluminium, which had corroded. The instruments were also missing - the most difficult parts to find - which Body speculated may be adorning someone's fireplace.

The MG was completed early this year and won the vintage car award at the end of April. Commenting on the MG's resurrection, a spokesman for the Early MG Society said it was one of only a few genuine MGs that have come to light in the last 25 years.
