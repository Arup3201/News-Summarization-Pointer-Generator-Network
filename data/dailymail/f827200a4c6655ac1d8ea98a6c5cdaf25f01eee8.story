Hit Channel 4 show Big Fat Gypsy Weddings is to return for a one-off episode next Monday and features two new traveller brides: Ina and Danielle, both 16.

Both are marrying their first loves and are pulling out all the stops to make their supersized glittery weddings go with a bang.

Sweet sixteen: Teenage bride, Ina Casey, arrives at her wedding in classic Traveller style

Colourful: Ina and her bridesmaids pose outside her home before hopping into a limo for the journey to church

Glitter ball: 16 year old Ina shows off her enormous 'glitter fabric' dress

Big blue: Ina's bridesmaids show off their aqua dresses - complete with bodices made from 'glitter fabric'

Ina, who is marrying her first (and only) boyfriend has set her heart on an outfit made from a 'glitter fabric' material more commonly used in wallpaper.

Despite her youth, Ina is convinced she has met 'the one', saying: 'Some people have to kiss 100 frogs to get their prince, I only had to kiss one.'

But as the wedding draws nearer the reality of leaving her family to start a new life begins to kick in and on the big day itself, the emotions come flooding out.

Ina's cousin and Maid of Honour is 18-year-old Estella. As she points out 'you spend half your life playing with Barbie dolls and the other half trying to look like one', but unlike Ina, Estella is in no hurry to settle down just yet.

The new episode also catches up with Danielle, 15, and her 21-year-old fianc√© Brendan.

The couple appeared in the last series, with Danielle's hen night - to which she wore an eye-catching tutu studded with fairy lights - featuring in one episode.

Nearly done! A nervous looking Brendan gets some reassurance from his new wife, Danielle

This time, it's Brendan's turn to celebrate, although unlike his bride-to-be, his party involves a spot of hunting, followed by songs and drinks around the campfire as Brendan is too afraid to go to the pub in case he gets into a fight.

Unlike the nervous Ina, Danielle is 
desperate to start her new life with her man and the wedding is 
scheduled to take place just a day after her 16th birthday.

'People think that I'm 15 and I don't
know what love is', says Danielle. 'But he's perfect for me and 
hopefully I'm perfect for him.'

Nevertheless a cloud hangs over the 
happy couple. Brendan is due to appear in court charged with receiving 
stolen goods and a 
guilty verdict could mean a lengthy prison sentence.

Danielle is determined to keep her fiance on the straight and narrow, while Brendan is equally desperate to avoid spending time at Her Majesty's pleasure.

See the full episode on Monday at 9pm. For more information, see channel4.com
