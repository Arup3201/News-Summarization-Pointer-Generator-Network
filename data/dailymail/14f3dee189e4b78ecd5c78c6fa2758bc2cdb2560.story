British cheese and wine is as good as
anything France has to offer, a Cabinet minister will declare today in 
an audacious speech in Paris.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson 
believes Stilton and sparkling wine from English vineyards can compete 
with camembert and champagne.

In a bold raid on Paris’s claim to 
being the food capital of the world, the minister will serve up 
traditional roast beef tonight in an attempt to boost exports of British
cuisine.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson claims British cheese and wine is as good as anything that can be found in France

Mr Paterson, who took charge of the 
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in last month’s 
reshuffle, is taking a more combative approach to promoting British food
and drink.

UK food exports to France have doubled from £1.1 billion to £2.2 billion since 2000.

Sales in cheese like Stilton and cheddar have quadrupled while whisky and beer exports have trebled.

Leading a trade delegation to the 
French capital, Mr Paterson will highlight how English sparkling wine is
increasingly served in leading Paris restaurants.

He said: ‘Whether it’s fromage or fizz, our top quality produce is proving to be a match for world-renowned French cuisine.

‘They’ve got a growing appetite for our food and drink, putting our industry in a great position to increase exports.’

Tonight a ‘St George’ reception, 
organised by beef and lamb industry body EBLEX, will see traditional 
roast beef served to French food importers.

Tomorrow Mr Paterson will meet the 
French Food Minister Guillaume Garot to argue that French families want 
to eat more British produce.

In a highly-provocative move, a reception is being held in Paris today to taken on France's claim to being the home of cuisine

Mr Paterson added: ‘Across the world demand for food is growing, and food and drink exports can be a significant source of British economic growth.

‘That’s why this Government’s doing all it can to help businesses at home and open up markets abroad.’

Food and farming is worth £89billion to the UK economy, according to Defra. The industry employs 3.5 million people.

Food and drink exports were up by 9 per cent last year to £18.2billion.

Last month Mr Paterson urged patriotic diners to help close Britain’s ‘dessert deficit’ by buying more British puddings.

‘We have a huge opportunity to replace imported desserts with desserts made here,’ he said.

There have also been deals struck to export more pork to China.
