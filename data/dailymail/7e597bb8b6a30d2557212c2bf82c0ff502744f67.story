Sportsmail take a trip into the Wimbledon 'Locker Room' - the place where you can find out some of the best of action on offer.

Samantha Murray is our pick in Brit Watch, plus we give the lowdown on the seed in danger. Discover which game is the ground pass bonus and find out the all-important, weather forecast for Tuesday's opening day of drama at SW19.

Samantha Murray (no relation to Andy) has a mountainous task in the shape of Maria Sharapova, having been granted a wild card.

Hailing from Stockport, the town of Fred Perry, she faces the French Open champion second on No 1 Court.

Heather Watson is second up on No 3 Court against Ajla Tomljanovic.

Full of optimism: Heather Watson faces Ajla Tomljanovic on Court three

Jelena Jankovic faces Kaia Kanepi fourth on No 2 Court and could be in for a tough match.

Estonia’s most famous sportsperson beat Laura Robson in the fourth round last year on her way to the quarter-finals and has also made the last eight at the French and US Opens.

Kenny de Schepper against Kei Nishikori could be an entertaining tangle first up on Court 12.

The Japan player is seeded 10th here but his French opponent made the fourth round last year beating 22nd-seed Juan Monaco in the process.
