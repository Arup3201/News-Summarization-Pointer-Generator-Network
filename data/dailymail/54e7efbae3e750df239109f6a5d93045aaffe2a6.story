When the talent-spotters descended on Drammen over the weekend they were not making their way to the music festival headlined by local synth pop favourites Donkeyboy and the former A-ha frontman Morten Harket.

The main attraction in this small city is Martin Odegaard, a 15-year-old sparkling in midfield for champions Stromsgodset, fresh out of school and poised to break a 110-year-old record this week as the youngest footballer to represent Norway at senior level.

His team were beaten on Saturday but it is easy to understand the excitement. Odegaard has the quick feet and technical class more readily associated with South American footballers.

Future star: Martin Odegaard has been called up to Norway's senior squad for their friendly against the UAE

Debut: The talented teen made his first appearance for Stromsgodset's senior team in June 2012

Congratulations: The midfielder's Stromsgodset team-mates applaud him during that game against Mjondalen

The ball sticks to him, the fans adore him, team-mates trust him and his boss David Nielsen likens him to Lionel Messi.

‘He has something really special,’ purrs Norway manager Per- Mathias Hogmo, who has called the teenager into a squad containing only home-based players for a friendly against the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday.

If he handles this well, he will either stay in the squad for next week’s friendly against England at Wembley, or play for the Under 21s in a competitive game against Portugal. Everyone agrees Norwegian football has never known anything quite like it.

Maturing: Odegaard has bulked up in the two years since making his bow for the Norwegian champions

There is known interest from more than 20 big-name European clubs who have requested tickets for games at Stromsgodset’s compact Marienlyst Stadion.

Only the best need apply. Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Real Madrid lead the hunt. Odegaard has been to England to train with Manchester United and has spent time in Germany with Bayern, Stuttgart and Borussia Dortmund.

Liverpool have been in touch, aware that Martin and his father Hans-Erik are lifelong fans.

Fast-tracked: Odegaard could make his international debut when Norway face United Arab Emirates 

Ronny Deila gave Martin his debut before leaving Drammen to become Celtic manager. And Tore Andre Flo at Chelsea’s academy should be in the loop because his brother Jostein is the director of football at Stromsgodset.

‘He’s a quality player, mature in the head and doesn’t get affected by all the hoopla that’s going on around him,’ said Nielsen. ‘The call-up is a good thing. It’s another experience for him, to go and get to know the coach there. He will be a future player for Norway. There’s no reason to wait.

‘You see these technical players involved at the big clubs and he’s going to be one of them. You can pick anybody. You can pick Lionel Messi or you can pick David Silva. He is a rare talent and we’re glad to have him.’

Odegaard’s tender years are obvious when you meet him. He smiles, he is polite and quietly spoken, a little sheepish about the erupting clamour. He says he wants to focus on the ‘small things’ and doesn’t expect to play for Norway when so many good and more experienced players are available.

Watch from the stands, though, and it’s hard to tell a 15-year-old is on the pitch. His shoulders are broad and his beautiful balance and awareness keep him clear of rough stuff. More than that, it’s his confidence and body language.

‘At the beginning it was not so easy,’ said Nielsen. ‘He was playing on his own, but he’s become a team player; he’s producing goals and scoring chances. He is 15 ... playing 90 minutes every week.’

Team-mates are quick to pass to him. They look to him for inspiration. He has quick feet and tricks but doesn’t showboat. He takes set-pieces with his left foot but Nielsen lets him play in peace.

There is no over-protection from the boss although he did react angrily and burst on to the pitch during Saturday’s 3-2 home defeat by Stabaek when Odegaard was brutally body-checked.

He glides with the ball, with traces of a young Michael Laudrup, thanks to long practice sessions with dad Hans-Erik, who played more than 200 times for Stromsgodset as an industrious midfielder and is now assistant manager of Mjondalen in the second tier.

Hans-Erik designed coaching drills to improve his son’s vision and worked with him each day from the age of five, often in the gym during the dark and cold Norwegian winter.

‘You can see he has a good first touch and good vision, so he never gets caught by the speed of the game,’ said Hans-Erik. ‘That’s what’s good about him. You can put him up through the levels and he can adapt.

‘His strength is not good but he deals with it because he doesn’t get caught, he has such vision. I had a plan, since he was five, to train him, always with the ball, to train his vision and technique. It is one thing to see, but another to understand and react.’

World at his feet: Odegaard keeps the ball from Magne Hoseth, a Norwegian player who was tipped for a bright future as a youngster in the late nineties while playing for Molde

Martin first trained with the Stromsgodset seniors at 13 and appeared in a first-team training game against Mjondalen at the same age. ‘He has not come through quickly at all, because he’s been this good since he’s been six,’ said Nielsen. ‘There are no overnight stars. They always work hard somewhere and he’s worked really hard.

‘This is probably the 15-year-old in the world who has trained the hardest and put in the most hours. He is an exceptional training talent, it’s just unbelievable. Everything he does is quality. He trains at a different level to any other player I’ve ever seen.’

Nielsen himself made his top-flight debut in Denmark for Odense at 16 and was the subject of interest from Bayern Munich. Despite a long career it did not quite unfold as planned.

He had spells in England at Wimbledon, Norwich and Grimsby before struggling with a gambling addiction, and is well placed to offer advice, not that he thinks it will be needed.

‘That’s why we’re all so calm,’ said Nielsen. ‘We don’t stress about the media hype because we see how he is reacting. You have to be careful but he’s shown we’ve been right to play him. He’s a part of the team. He’s not a 15-year-old but a player in my squad.

‘You never know what’s going to happen down the road, but this player has got the talent and he is going to make it big-time. He is focused. He wants this and he has no distractions around him. Of course, there are always things that can happen, but we don’t think about that. We just need to guide him here and there.’

Nielsen believes the best development programme would involve at least another season in Norway before Hans-Erik and his wife Lene make a family decision. Martin has a brother, Kristoffer (17), and sisters Emilie (10) and Mari (six).

Grounded: The 15-year-old could feature against England at Wembley when Norway visit on September 3

‘My phone has been hot,’ said Hans-Erik. ‘Since the end of May, there was just one day in July when there were no calls. The first one came last autumn. Since then it’s increased and by the time he was picked for the national team, every club knew him.

‘The big danger for every young kid is that they are satisfied too quickly. They need a hunger to im-prove. Since he was five, he has always been focused to improve. At some point he has to move on to improve more, but when that will happen I don’t know.

‘We have to see. We have feet on the ground but we know everything has taken off and there’s so much attention on him. I’ve said to all the agents and the clubs that he is too young to go alone.

‘I don’t think it’s good for any 15-year-old boy to move abroad to a different country with a different language, different culture, to be alone sitting in a flat, coming in late on February nights, hungry.

‘You need a family to feel secure. So if that’s going to happen soon, we move with him. And that’s not easy because I have a job, working for my father-in-law’s textile shops, and we have a family.’
