An Illinois teen has been suspended after she brought a clutch purse to school to conceal her feminine hygiene products.

Galesburg High School kicked Carrie Harding's 17-year-old daughter out of class last Monday, claiming she was violating a ban on purses that was introduced campus-wide in October 2013.

The school allegedly told the girl she could only continue to carry a purse if she had a doctor's note saying she had a medical condition.

Purse: Carrie Harding's 17-year-old daughter was given in-school suspension Monday because she carried this purse, pictured, to class

'Really, a medical condition? I mean, every woman has it every month. It's not a medical condition, it's nature,' Harding told WQAD.com.

Principal Roy Van Meter said at the time handbags were being outlawed after students were caught texting inside them or bringing 'inappropriate' items to class.

'Things like people texting in purses, in class or inappropriate items coming into class; and so it wasn't a single incident, it wasn't even two or three, it was a combination of all those,' he said on October 18 explaining the ban.

He declined to comment on Monday's incident, which Harding said was taking the rule way too far.

'Checking
 for weapons and checking for drugs and checking for all that, I am in 
compliance with that all the way, but this was the last straw,' Harding 
said.

She said her daughter got sent to in-school suspension after she was spotted with a purple, gold-studded bag in class.

'She carries her personal feminine napkins in it, hand sanitizing lotion and wipes during her monthly cycle.'

But she said 'that time of the month' was not a valid excuse, according to the school.

Harding said her daughter normally loves school but after the incident, she didn't want to go back'I didn't find it fair. I thought it was quite degrading actually,' said Harding.
