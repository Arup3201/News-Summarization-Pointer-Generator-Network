A Georgia grandfather was nearly beaten to death last week with a tire-iron by a down-and-out man he'd tried for years to help.

The family and friends of Roy Davis, 78, expressed their shock at his brush with death an described him as a caring and generous man.

'He would give you the shirt off his back,” said niece Ginger Gaff.

But it may have been that generosity that attracted his attacker.

Besides a broken arm, finger, and a lost eye, Davis needed three dozen staples in his head

According to Newton County Sheriff's deputies, Mark Winder attacked Davis despite years of friendship.

'I have known him for a couple of years or so and he would come on by and he would help me. I would give him a little bit of money and he would help me clean my garage and I’d help him pay probation and stuff like that,' Davis told My Fox 8. 

Winder came by Davis's home last week asking for the loan of a tire iron. 

'When I turned around I recon he knocked my brains out with the tire iron,' Davis recalled.

Davis was then dragged into the house.

Winder continued beating the man, all the while asking him to hand over his cash.

'They say he drug me around the house,' Davis said, 'had me tied and bandaged up with old tape.'

Relatives say despite his ordeal when he woke up in the hospital he was actually acting happy

Davis eventually played dead to keep the beating from continuing.

Besides a broken arm, finger, and a lost eye, Davis needed three dozen staples in his head.  

But when he woke up in the hospital he was actually acting happy.

'He was actually in a good mood flirting like he always does. He was ready to come home,' Gaff said.

Winder is charged with aggravated assault and battery.

'He is really lucky he is alive,' Gaff told My Fox 8. 'Real lucky he is alive. I mean with the guns all around here, he could have easily been killed and he probably would have killed him.'
