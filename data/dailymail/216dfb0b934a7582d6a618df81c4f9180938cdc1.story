A frail 97-year-old care patient had human excrement smeared on his nose by a nurse who scolded him for being incontinent, a jury was told.

Care home worker Barbara Kowalska is accused of ranting at elderly cancer patient Albert Inggall, calling him 'dirty and filthy' before shouting at him: 'If you do this again you’ll be eating s*** cake.'

The 34-year-old nurse, who was working at the BUPA-run Donnington Care Home, in Donnington, near Newbury, Berkshire denies a single count of the neglect of a person with mental incapacity.

Accusation: Barbara Kowalska, a nurse at the BUPA-run Donnington Care Home, near Newbury, is accused of smearing human excrement on an elderly patient's nose

The jury at Reading Crown Court heard that Kowalska had got the human excrement on her gloves as she helped clean up dementia sufferer Mr Inggall, who had no control over his bowel and bladder and also needed help to get around, eat and dress himself.

She then deliberately rubbed her faeces-covered finger on his nose, the jury was told.

The registered nurse had been called to help care assistant Tina Braybrooke clean up the elderly man, who had been living at the care home for more than two years.

Because of his failing state of mind Mr Inggall had been made subject under the Mental Capacity Act as having no ability to decide his own care.

Michael Williams, prosecuting, told the jury that the incident happened between August 24 and 28 2012.

'Tina Braybrooke recalls her coming into the room and ranting that Mr Inggall was dirty and filthy,' he said.

'She told Mr Inggall who was sitting in his chair "if you do this again you’ll be eating s*** cake".

'She said she was upset that he was spoken to in this way but felt to scared to say anything to Miss Kowalska.'

As the pair began cleaning up Mr Inggall and got him onto a commode before putting him back to bed, Kowalska made the indignant act.

'During the cleaning up Miss Kowalska had got faeces on her glove and Tina Braybrooke describes her using her finger to smear faeces on Mr Inggall’s nose,' said the prosecuter.

Miss Braybrooke reported the incident to another colleague and the matter was then reported to police by the home’s general manager.

After her arrest, Kowalska, formerly of Newbury, told police she had held up a pan of faeces to Mr Inggall’s face because he was asking about what was going on.

She said was not aware anything had got onto his nose.

The trial continues.
