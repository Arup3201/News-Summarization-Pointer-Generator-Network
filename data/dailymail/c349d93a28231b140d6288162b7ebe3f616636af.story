Accrington Stanley have highlighted the class divide in English football between the fourth tier and top flight with a cheeky Twitter post on Premier League's record-smashing £5billion TV rights deal.

The self-described 'club that wouldn't die' say that one match in the new deal, worth an average of about £10million would cover their most significant outgoings - player wages - for two decades.

As Sky Sports and BT Sport poured a combined £5.136bn into the 168 games that will be shown live between 2016 and 2019, and the headline clubs contemplated what they'd do with their riches, Stanley's social media mouthpiece put things into perspective. 

'The Prem Lge has a new £5bn TV deal. £10m per match. 1 game would pay our annual wage bill for the next 20 years,' ASFC posted on Twitter on Wednesday afternoon.

Sky Sports took up five of the  seven packages on offer for the three seasons from 2016-17, while the other two went to BT Sport as the deal marked a 70 per cent boost on the current deal for the Premier League, already the world's richest football competition. 

While League Two's 15th-placed club didn't go into exact details of their costings, the more the numbers are crunched on the staggering deal the more clubs down the pecking order's proverbial jaws will drop. 

BT Sport are forking out £7.6m a game for their packages of Saturday afternoon games and midweek matches, but Sky are paying a whopping £11.1m-a-match for their five sets that include a first for Friday nights, Saturday lunchtimes, two slots on Sunday, Monday evening, and Bank Holidays. 

If CIty claim top spot in 2016-17, as they did last season, they will get around £156m from TV rights alone

Of course, comparisons between Accrington Stanley and world famous Liverpool gave the club international recognition in the 1980s in an advertisement for the Milk Marketing Board.

When one kid was disgusted by his friend having a glass of milk, he says: It's what Ian Rush drinks... He said if I didn't drink lots of milk, when I grow up, I'll only be good enough to play for Accrington Stanley.'

The milk hater said: 'Accrington Stanley, who are they?'

'Exactly,' was the famous response that has now become a catch phrase.

As with the milk ad, Accrington see none of the Premier League deal that works out at £1,887 per second of action shown.

Of course, the clubs don't see all of this money, but they do get the lion's share with the bottom club in the 2016-17 season when the new deal begins expecting £99million from the TV rights, up from £62m this season and £1.5m more than this year's top club will get.

The top club, and the Crown Ground faithful may want to look away now, will get around £156m for the 2016-17 campaign up from £97.5m this time around. 

With Premier League clubs concentrating on building their brands internationally and working out how to best monetise already packed stadiums, Accrington Stanley just want their turnstiles at the Crown - with a capacity of 5,057 with 2,000 seated - to be troubled. 

@ASFC boasts 20,200 followers which it's pointed out would fill the Crown Ground more than four times over: 'Be lovely if even 10% of you could make it to a game 1 day.'

The club also shows what the simple purchase of a scarf would do for its young players. 'Selling 15 of these pays 1 of our young professionals for a week,' the club posted on Wednesday with a link to its red and white merchandise.

'We may not be in Prem. We may not be on TV. We may not be glamorous. But we care about every share & shareholder #stanleyfamily,' says the account, directing followers to invest in their £100 share packages that earn them a vote at the club AGM and the honour of joining the ranks of Sir Alex Ferguson and famous fan David Lloyd.

'So watch the Prem on TV. Enjoy it. Just please keep an eye on your local lower league club. We all need your support. Thanks.'
