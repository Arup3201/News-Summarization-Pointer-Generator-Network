THE estranged father of supermodel Agyness Deyn has spoken for the first time about the rift with his daughter and how he holds out little hope of being part of her life again.

Ken Hollins spoke exclusively to The Mail on Sunday following the surprise wedding of Ms Deyn, 29, to American actor Giovanni Ribisi in a Los Angeles registrar office last month.

Asked if he attended the wedding, Mr Hollins said: ‘I don’t think anyone went, did they?’

He said he was extremely proud of his daughter – but does not expect to meet her again.

‘I’ve
got just about every magazine she’s ever appeared in. The door’s always
open for her, she knows that and I’d do anything for her. It’s just one
of those things,’ he said.

Ms
Deyn was formerly known as Laura Hollins, the middle child of three 
born to Mr Hollins and Lorraine, a specialist hospital nurse, in 
Littleborough, near Rochdale.

When
her parents divorced in 1996 after 23 years of marriage, Ms Deyn, her 
younger sister and older brother lived with their mother.

Mr Hollins, who lives in Bury, disputes claims that he played little part in his daughter’s upbringing after the divorce.

He said: ‘Children always gravitate towards their mothers.’

Secret: Details of the wedding emerged when Ms Deyn's sister posted a photograph of the couple online

Ms Deyn is now based in America, but it is unclear how she met 37-year-old Ribisi. The pair were spotted ‘passionately kissing’ in a queue at Los Angeles County Registrar, where they were married on June 15, but had not previously been seen together.

Ribisi, who has appeared in Saving Private Ryan and Avatar, is still most famous for his role in the long-running sitcom Friends, in which he played Phoebe’s brother, Frank.

Some observers have suggested the surprise wedding might suggest a baby is on the way.

Mr Hollins says his daughter will not contact him, even if she does have children. ‘No, I’ll be pushing daisies by then,’ he added.
