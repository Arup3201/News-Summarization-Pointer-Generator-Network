A six-month-old baby and a man in his 20s are dead after what authorities believe is a police-assisted murder-suicide.

The unidentified man stabbed young Roberto Varela to death and charged at Folsom, California police with a knife, giving the officer no choice but to shoot the suspect dead, cops said.

Arela Aguilar, the baby’s mother and the man’s aunt, was also stabbed but is expected to survive, said police.

Neighbors claims the two have had a frosty relationship that recently took a turn for the worse as they constantly argued in the days leading up to the tragedy.

Aguilar and the man are said to have increasingly been at odds, and were heard early Thursday morning shouting at each other loudly enough to have been heard by neighbors.

The argument spilled out into the neighborhood about 12 hours later, around 2.30 p.m., when neighbors say they heard shouting and gunfire.

‘I heard ... gunshots and a lady screaming,’ James McClean told the Folsom Telegraph. ‘A whole bunch of police cars showed up.’

Aguilar was soon seen on the grass in front of her apartment holding a wound and screaming in pain, neighbors told the Sacramento Bee.

First responders soon arrived to take care of the ailing woman and the man came charging out of the home and at cops.

‘Then a police officer showed up and a guy came running out and running at the cop and yelling ‘f-you’ … the cop shot him,’ Bryan Thomas told the Telegraph.

Police tried to revive the man but were unsuccesful.

‘We came outside and saw all the commotion, them trying to resuscitate the guy,’ Joshua Smith told KMAX.

Another woman, covered in blood, was soon led away from the home in tears, footage showed.

The dead toddler was not found by investigators until some time later, KMAX reported.

‘That’s more shocking than the whole thing, that a baby was involved,’ added Smith.

Investigators are working to determine exactly what happened, but believe the man’s intention was to die from police gunfire.

The investigation remains ongoing.
