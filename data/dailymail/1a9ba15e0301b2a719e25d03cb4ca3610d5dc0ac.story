Convicted: PR man Richard Hillgrove has been given a suspended sentence for tax evasion

A controversial PR adviser who failed to pay a £100,000 tax bill and spent the money on school fees, luxury holidays and parties has avoided jail.

Richard Hillgrove, who has worked for figures such as Charles Saatchi and Sting, siphoned off VAT, income tax and National Insurance and took the money for himself.

However, he walked free from court today after being given a suspended sentence and told to pay just £5,000 towards the costs of his prosecution.

Hillgrove, 42, a New Zealander who lives in Somerset, is the owner of Hillgrove Public Relations Limited and calls himself 'the UK's leading crisis communications and corporate reputation management expert'.

In 2011 and 2012, he failed to pay HM Revenue and Customs £52,268 of VAT charged to customers of his company, Bristol Crown Crown Court heard.

He also deducted £44,846 in taxes from the wages of his employees during the same period but failed to pay it to HMRC.

At the same time, he spent thousands of pounds on 'extravagant' purchases such as expensive restaurant meals and the fees at leading public school Millfield.

Hillgrove ignored repeated warnings from his accountants - brought in to help repay debts from a previous business - and told them to 'hold fire' on sending tax returns.

The jury was told that he 'failed to grasp' his company's 'cash flow issues' and continued to withdraw too much money.

Recorder Robert Linford today sentenced him to 15 months imprisonment, suspended for two years, and ordered him to pay £5,000 towards prosecution costs and complete 200 hours of unpaid work.

'It is quite clear from the perusal of your bank accounts you were servicing a lifestyle that you simply couldn't afford,' the judge said.

'You told the jury that in the public relations world there's an expectation that public relations consultants take their clients out and spend money on them to keep them as customers.

'I have no doubt at all that the desire to keep customers sweet explains some of the extravagant spending. It does not explain the trip to Madeira or the expensive 30th birthday party for your wife.'

The judge said Hillgrove's defence during his trial had been 'unpleasant' at times, adding: 'This was not a conspiracy against you. To suggest that it was is ludicrous.

'You need to rebuild your life and pay the Government what you owe them.'

Mr Linford also warned Hillgrove that he would be under added scrutiny from HMRC in the future, and would face dire consequences if he ever 'fouled up' again.

Hillgrove's wife Lois, who supported her husband from the public gallery, collapsed and had to be helped from the courtroom as the judge pronounced the sentence.

Hillgrove had denied two charges of cheating the public revenue, but he was convicted by a jury in March.

During the trial, prosecutor Joss Ticehurst said Hillgrove should have 'trimmed down' his spending to pay the taxman but failed to do so - as he never intended to hand over the money owed.

'This was a deliberate act on the part of Mr Hillgrove to not pay his taxes,' Mr Ticehurst said today.

'It wasn't simply a one-off, this was for the period of a year. For the period of a year at the start of a new company, and on the back of a history of poor payment of taxes.'

Hillgrove told the judge he was working in London five days a week to pay his overheads of £18,000 per month.

'I have always done ringing the newspapers and getting people who want to be on television and get their stories across,' he told the judge. 'I can't do that if the sentence is custodial.'

Speaking after the verdict, he refused to confirm whether or not Mr Saatchi is currently a client of his, describing the mogul as 'a friend of a friend'. He added that he planned to appeal against his sentence. 

Hillgrove PR, founded by the Stetson-wearing New Zealander Richard Hillgrove, claims to represent dozens of well-known companies and individuals.

Among the list of current and former clients on the firm's website are Sting, Little Chef, KPMG, Yo! Sushi, Aldi, and Dragon's Den stars James Caan and Duncan Bannatyne.

He calls himself 'the UK's leading crisis communications and corporate reputation management expert and the doyen of both personal and business branding', and many of those who have worked with him have given rave reviews.

For example, John Bird, founder of the Big Issue, called Hillgrove 'the kind of promoter I could have done with for the last 20 years'.

However, last year Hillgrove found himself on the receiving end of media attention when it emerged that he was advising both Charles Saatchi and the Grillo sisters, who had been fired as personal assistants to Saatchi and Nigella Lawson.

He described himself as a 'behind-the-scenes svengali' for the billionaire art collector as he was accused of spreading rumours about Saatchi's ex-wife Nigella Lawson taking drugs.
