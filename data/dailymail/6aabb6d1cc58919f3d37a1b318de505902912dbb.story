A federal judge has slammed Miami-Dade County for refusing to delay demolition of a soldier's home while he trained in California for deployment to the Middle East.

The soldier's kids and pregnant wife were kicked to the curb and the house was razed in 2011 after U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Jesus Jimenez did not heed numerous county requests to fix building code violations.

Jimenez had repeatedly asked for extensions to fix the problems while he training or on a mission. At one point his commanding military officer also weighed in, asking to officials to stay the hearing 90 days while Jimenez was conducting training on how to defuse improvised explosive devices in Iraq.

Homeless: Jesus Jimenez, his wife, Laura, and their newborn son in 2011 after their house was demolished before Jimenez deployed to Afghanistan for the second time

Demolished: The couple's home was razed for code violations and Jimenez's wife didn't even have time to take out all their belongings

The family was able to save soem of their belongings, but much of what they owned was lost--including a piano--when the home was demolished.

'They didn't care,' 32-year-old Laura Jimenez told the Miami Herald.

U.S. Judge Robert Scola Jr. sided with the father of four, last week, scheduling a September trial to decide what the county owes Jimenez. But he urged both sides to first attempt a settlement.

At issue is a World War II-era law, reinstated in 2003, that allows for the temporary suspension of legal or administrative proceedings that could affect active duty military members' civil rights.

'While it is possible that the Jimenezes employed dilatory tactics to avoid remedying the violations on their property and complying with the applicable building ordinances,' Scola wrote, 'their behavior does not negate the (county's) failure to stay the proceedings....'

The county argued that Jimenez was in the Army Reserves when it issued the violations. But Scola ruled that since Jimenez was on active duty when he requested the stay, he should have been protected.

Before: The county complained the Jimenez home had a deteriorated roof and porch beams and Jimenez asked for more time to fix it, but to no avail

Fair? the county placed this notice on the home two months before they razed it

County officials declined to discuss the case with the Herald, citing the ongoing litigation. But in court filings, Miami-Dade representatives said they'd given Jimenez more than enough time to fix the violations between deployments.

The family rented seven rooms in two houses without permission. Among the problems with their home that sparked the initial code enforcement citations: deteriorating porch beams and a deteriorated roof, as well as a damaged door and an uncovered electrical junction box.

Jimenez says he tried to fix the initial problems but didn't have the money to take out the necessary construction permits.

Then he was sent to a Wisconsin training base and was fined for failing to complete the work.

Meanwhile, inspectors reviewed the house more closely and ordered more improvements, including covering exposed wiring and other hazards. After more failed negotiations over the home, the family's power was shut off.Â 

Eventually, Jimenez hired an engineer and an architect to make the necessary changes, but the county said the problems were so extensive it would be better to start from scratch.

Jimenez says the county targeted his family while ignoring other similar houses in the neighborhood. His attorney wants the city to drop all liens, suspend code-enforcement activities and pay $395,000 in 20 days. In exchange, the family would agree to sell the property where the house was demolished, as well as two other neighboring homes they own.

Fighting back: This sign now stands in place of the home, blasting the county for demolishing it. Jimenez is suing the county and a federal judge has sided with the soldier
