A man attacked his gay flatmate with a hammer, embedding it in his skull as he slept, a court has heard.  

Connor Huntley, 18, was sleeping when Joseph Williams allegedly launched the attack just hours after the pair settled into a new flat in Margate, Kent. 

The 30-year-old had previously made 'disparaging comments' about homosexuality, the Old Bailey heard. 

Connor Huntley (pictured) needed brain surgery after being attacked in the flat he shared with Joseph Williams in Margate 

Williams, who told police his mental health had 'deteriorated' after the alleged assault, denies attempted murder and causing grievous bodily harm with intent. 

Jurors were told Mr Huntley from Dover had been looking forward to moving into the flat after leaving school, and was getting along well with Williams on May 27 last year. 

‘He was upbeat - his first night in his own flat away from people’, said Edward Woolley, who helped Mr Huntley move in to the property. 

‘He probably felt a bit grown up in his own place.’

‘They got on like a house on fire. It was like they had been friends for ages.

‘They were telling each other about their childhoods, they seemed quite friendly to me.’

But Mr Woolley's girlfriend, Abbie Smith, told jurors the accused had hinted at violence in the weeks beforehand.   

The teenager was 'getting along well' with the accused on the day the alleged attack is said to have taken place 

‘He said, just out of the blue, that he couldn't live with Connor because he would end up hitting him.

‘We were not having a conversation about Connor, he just said it,' she told the court. 

‘I stuck up for my friend a bit, saying he had done nothing wrong.

‘But that was left at that.’

Mr Huntley was last seen by the couple at 11.30pm on May 27. Williams is thought to have spent the night at the home of his girlfriend. 

At 5.10am, the accused allegedly sent a text message to his partner to tell her he had had a nice time. 

Forty minutes later, he sent a series of messages saying 'help', the court heard. 

At 10.30am Ms Smith tried to visit Mr Huntley, who, it is thought, often wears women's clothing, but that Williams refused her entry. 

He later phoned 999, telling operators: 'I don’t know how to say this but he’s dead in my flat. I hit him on the head with a hammer in his sleep.’

The trial at the Old Bailey in London (pictured) continues. Williams denies attempted murder and grievous bodily harm with intent 

He is alleged to have told them: 'My mental health just deteriorated'. 

Police arrived to discover the teenager lying on an air bed with the hammer embedded in his skull. 

He suffered a depressed skull fracture and traumatic brain injury.   

Yesterday prosecutors claimed Williams had made 'disparaging comments' about homosexuality in the past. 

Prosecutor Philip Bennetts QC said: 'They were not the obvious flatmates.' 

'On the morning of 28 May last year the defendant attacked Mr Huntley with a hammer while Mr Huntley was asleep. There were at least two blows to his head.

'The hammer penetrated his skull and was embedded in his skull.

'The injuries were life threatening at the time but fortunately he survived.' 

The trial continues.
