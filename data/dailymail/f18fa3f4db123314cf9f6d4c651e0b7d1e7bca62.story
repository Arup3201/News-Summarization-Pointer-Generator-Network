A week Sir Michael Stoute will probably want to forget might just end with a reminder why the 10-time champion Newmarket trainer is held in such high esteem.

Becoming embroiled in the spate of positive tests for Morphine which have hit the sport is hardly the way Stoute would have chosen to prepare for Ascot’s £1million Qipco King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes, the midsummer highlight of the Flat season.

Especially when one of your two horses involved is the headline-grabbing Queen’ s 2013 Ascot Gold Cup winner and 2014 runner-up Estimate.

The fact that the blame for the positives appears to lie with a feed manufacturer will hardly have lessened the embarrassment.

Bad week: Estimate, trained by Sir Michael Stoute and owned by the Queen, tested positive for morphine

But the reason the Queen turned to Stoute to train her horses was because of his reputation for patiently and successfully producing champions.

Five winners in the King George, starting with Shergar 1981, have been sent out from his Freemason Lodge Stables and one more will make Stoute the most successful trainer in the race’s history.

In Telescope, the 2-1 favourite, Stoute saddles a Ryan Moore-ridden colt which has been typically given time to find its feet after injury disrupted its 2013 season and prevented a Derby tilt.

Defeat on his first two runs in 2014 did not derail the Stoute master-plan and when Telescope streaked seven lengths clear in Royal Ascot’s Hardwicke Stakes his place in this afternoon’s race was sealed.

That performance inevitably drew comparisons with Stoute’s latest King George winner, Harbinger, owned like Telescope by Highclere Throughbred Racing, who completed the Hardwicke-King George double in 2010.

Favourite: Sir Michael Stoute's horse Telescope is strong favourite for the King George VI

Gold Cup: The Queen and her daughter Princess Anne greet the horse, Estimate

Harry Herbert, racing manager for Highclere, said: ‘Sir Michael has trained him brilliantly to come in his own time.

‘We have had late-maturing horses with Sir Michael. At this time of year, they find their strength and maturity and start improving in leaps and bounds. You just never know how far.

‘Telescope had a very high profile for a long time. It was incredibly public when he didn’t make the Derby and there have been a couple of other issues. Suddenly he got the reputation of being  a talking horse.

‘But he has never been out of the first two in his life, was impressive when he won last season’s Great Voltigeur Stakes and would run in the Champion Stakes but got a tiny bone chip in a fetlock joint.

‘He developed mentally and really relaxed and switched off through the winter so Michael  said it was going to take a race or two to get him fit and after he was beaten by Noble Mission at Chester in May, Sir Michael said to make sure I told the owners not to lose faith.

Feed: Estimate's positive drug test was a result of horse feed contaminated with morphine

‘At Royal Ascot we saw the blossoming Telescope. In right conditions he is a talented horse.’

One of those owners is ex-Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who might make it to Ascot after a bug prevented him leaving with his former team on their US tour earlier this week.

Ferguson is shrewd enough to know Telescope and Stoute’s reputation are built into his odds with strong opponents lining up.

They include William Haggas-trained Eclipse Stakes winner Mukhadram and Aidan O’ Brien’s 2013 Breeders’ Cup Turf hero Magician, who looks  a big danger.

A high temperature has ruled out Andre Fabre’s French hope Flintshire but the heavy showers that fell on the track yesterday turning the going Good have ensured the participation of John Gosden’s King Edward VII Stakes winner Eagle Top.

Gosden saddles two other three-year-olds making this the clash of the generations the King George is meant to be.

They are Derby third Romsdal and Oaks winner Taghrooda, who receives a significant 15lb from Telescope. A win for any of his trio would be a significant blow in Gosden’s attempts to win a second trainers’ championship.
