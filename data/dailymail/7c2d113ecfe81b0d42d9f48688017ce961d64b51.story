The Duchess of Cambridge's brother has failed to make a profit with his food business for the third year in a row, after recording an annual £23,000 loss.

James Middleton's cake and bread brand Nice Group London Limited made a total loss of £23,353 for the 12 months to March 2014, accounts filed this week have shown.

It means the company, which was set up in April 2011, is yet to post a profit, having lost £19,928 in its first year of trading and £21,148 in its second year. The company also owes creditors £76,394.

The cake and bread business run by James Middleton, 27 (left), the brother of the Duchess of Cambridge (right), has lost more than £23,000 in its third year 

A visit to the company's website today shows it is still under construction 

Mr Middleton, 27, has again had to ask his family for financial help for the business, according to the accounts filed at Companies House. 

Under a section entitled Creditors: Amounts falling due within one year, it reads: 'The bank overdraft is secured by a member of the director's family.' 

He told MailOnline: 'My focus over the last year has been on Boomf as it really has taken off.

'We managed to secure £1million in funding and are up 320 per cent from last Christmas, we are shipping all over the world and we are also in Selfridges printing onto marshmallows there and then.

'We have our first TV advert coming out next month, which is very exciting and we are launching new products this year so my energy has been focused on Boomf.'

He added: 'This will be a deciding year for Nice Group.'

Mr Middleton, a former public school boy, dropped out of the University of Edinburgh in 2006 after a year of studying to go into business.

He set up Nice Group London in 2011, the same year sister Kate married Prince William.

But he has so far failed to recreate the success of his parents, Carol and Michael, who made millions with their own Party Pieces venture.

Mr Middleton has defended his losses in previous years, telling MailOnline: 'Nice Group is a start-up company and as you can imagine there are overheads needed to start a company.

'It is not uncommon for start-up companies to make a loss in the early stages of development and it is not something I am concerned about right now.' 

Nice Group London is registered to the family's trading headquarters close to their Berkshire home.

It filed the accounts signed by Mr Middleton - the sole director and shareholder - with Companies House. The paperwork covers the company's third full year of trading.

Mr Middleton is also a director at Nice Cakes, which sells things such as personalised cupcakes which have company logos and photographs printed in edible ink.

It caused controversy in its early days by selling a line of adult-themed cakes iced with naughty slogans. 

These included a 'stud muffin' cake featuring a picture of a man and the caption: 'A willy that wriggles and gives me the giggles'.

Another is the Cake Kit Company, which sells bits needed to make different styles of birthday cakes, including a princess-like doll. 

Hopefully the budding entrepreneur will have better luck with the bespoke marshmallow company he founded, Boomf - which sells nine marshmallows for $25 (£15).
