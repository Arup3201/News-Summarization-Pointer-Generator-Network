Squadron Leader Ronald Fairfax Hamlyn shot down five enemy planes during three missions in a single day during the Battle of Britain in August 1940

The remarkable story of an RAF hero who achieved 'ace' status in a single day of flying has come to light after his medals were put up for sale.

Squadron Leader Ronald Fairfax Hamlyn - known as the 'Pied Piper of Harrogate' - shot down five enemy planes during three missions in a single day during the Battle of Britain.

On the first occasion he shot down a Junkers 88 bomber  in his Spitfire followed by a Messerschmitt 109 (Me109) off the Kent coast. 

Records show how he took off again at 11.35am and chased another Me109 across the English Channel before taking it down over Calais.

He then achieved his fourth and fifth hits after lunch with two more Me109s off the Isle of Sheppey.

His log book shows the three separate flights lasted just three and a half hours.  

Within days Squadron Leader Hamlyn was invited on to the BBC to broadcast his account of 'Bringing Down Five German Bombers' to the nation.

In all, the airman claimed 11 kills during the Battle of Britain, with eight in only six days in August 1940.

His exploits helped repel Adolf Hitler's plans to invade Britain. 

The failure of Germany to achieve its objectives of destroying Britain's air defences, or forcing Britain to negotiate an armistice or even an outright surrender, is considered its first major defeat and a crucial turning point in the Second World War.

Before breakfast, he set off in his Spitfire for his first mission of the day.

On his first flight of the day, lasting an hour and ten minutes, he shot down a Junkers 88 bomber followed by a Messerschmitt 109 off the Kent coast.

He then returned to the mess at Biggin Hill, in south east London, for breakfast. 

He took off again at 11.35am and was soon in action, chasing another Me109 across the English Channel and taking it down over Calais.

He then returned for lunch in the mess shortly after 1pm following an hour and 35 minutes of flying. 

After lunch he returned to the skies, this time achieving his fourth and fifth ‘kills’ - two Me109s off the Isle of Sheppey. His final mission lasted just 45 minutes.  

Squadron Leader Hamlyn was personally commended by Winston Churchill for his exploits and was awarded the prestigious Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) for the 'ace in a day' feat.

He went on to fly Hurricanes and sink German shipping in the North Sea and the English Channel before being posted to an air sea rescue squadron which helped recover more than 60 men from the sea.

His impressive medal group, including the DFC and the Air Force Cross, is now being sold at auction for an estimated £60,000.

They have been owned by a private collector for more than 15 years. The medals are being sold with his log book, which includes his own drawings of German aircraft and shipping he had destroyed.

Oliver Pepys, of auctioneers Spinks of London, said: 'As far as we are aware there were only two British airmen in the Second World War who achieved ace in a day status, Ronald Hamlyn was one of them.

'It is a very distinguished but very rare list. His job was to shoot down enemy aircraft and he had one fabulous day where he got into the groove and just carried on.

'These men might have had tally-hunting in their mind but when you have a Messerschmitt 109 in your sights you probably aren't thinking about that at the time, it is more kill or be killed.

'But I'm sure when he got back to the mess he would have had a few drinks to mark the achievement.

'The size of the estimate reflects the story and the man behind the medals. It is there to guide people to the fact this medal group deserves serious consideration and a high bid.'

The citation for his 'Distinguished Flying Medal' in August 1940 stated: 'The pilot's feat of destroying five enemy aircraft in one day shows great skill, courage and good marksmanship'

Squadron Leader Hamlyn, from Harrogate, in North Yorkshire, joined the RAF in 1936 at the age of 22, and was posted to 72 Squadron in Scotland.

By June 1940 the squadron was rushed to Kent and he took part in air patrols over the beaches of Dunkirk where 400,000 Allied troops were waiting to be evacuated.

He was then moved to 610 Squadron which he served in for the Battle of Britain.

The citation for his 'Distinguished Flying Medal' in August 1940 stated: 'The pilot's feat of destroying five enemy aircraft in one day shows great skill, courage and good marksmanship.'

Squadron Leader Hamlyn retired from the RAF in 1957. In civilian life he worked for the Save the Children charity. He died in 1991 aged 77.

His medal group is being sold by Spinks on November 20.
