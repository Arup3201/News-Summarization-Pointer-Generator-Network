On the way home from Old Trafford on Monday night, the debate, as it turned out, was the wrong debate.

Should Danny Welbeck have been sold to Arsenal last summer? Should he have celebrated his winning goal back in Manchester?

Both questions were irrelevant. Welbeck is an honest and talented footballer but he wouldn’t make a difference to Louis van Gaal’s United. He is good without being really good.

Welbeck, whose international record is better than his club record, scored a well-taken and well-anticipated goal on Monday and celebrated appropriately. His overall performance, though, was modest. Had he been playing in red rather than in blue and yellow, the result would not have been different.

On Tuesday Welbeck said: ‘Manchester United is a club that means so much to me. I’m a fan and it’s hard to knock them out. I’ll always respect the fans. I had a lovely reception and I’m thankful for that.’

But United’s problems under Van Gaal go much deeper than any associated with his decision last August to sell a player he figured — with reason — would have been his fourth-choice centre forward.

Tactical genius? Not quite. Louis van Gaal received 3/10 for his tactics on Monday night, but what about the players?

The most telling moments of this FA Cup tie came in the second half. It was a close game at that point. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger will have been disappointed his team had conceded an equaliser so carelessly so soon after taking the lead but at half-time he appeared to tell his team to continue in the same vein. Van Gaal, however, sniffed danger, or thought he did.

He made two substitutions, neither of them positive, and that seemed indicative of a coach unsure of his players and unconvinced by his original plan. He did a similar thing at Swansea recently and United lost that one, too.

Later, with United chasing in the wake of Welbeck’s goal and Angel di Maria’s sending-off, Van Gaal pushed Marouane Fellaini — and, soon after, Chris Smalling — to the top of the United formation and asked them to feed off a diet of long balls pumped from their own half.

With their exit from the FA Cup against Arsenal, Manchester United's attention now rests solely on the Premier League.

Yet United haven't beaten a side currently in the top half since their home win against Liverpool in mid December last year.

This is a valid tactic and one that worked at West Ham last month. Fellaini, in particular, can be strangely effective in that role.

Nevertheless, while this was going on, United’s Spanish playmaker Juan Mata and their Colombian centre forward Radamel Falcao sat in the dug-out. They were still there when an aimless hoof from Phil Jones rolled out of play for a goal-kick and referee Michael Oliver signalled the end of the game. This, perhaps, is most damning.

Van Gaal’s tactical preferences can be discussed all night long. United, whether they knew it or not, hired a pragmatist last summer and it is that side of the manager that the supporters are seeing now. 

More pertinent is the fact that one of European football’s leading coaches decided — at the sharp end of a home cup tie that he knew his team must win — to put his trust in some Hackney Marshes football rather than ask two players in whom his club has invested millions of pounds to go on and change the game through method and design. It is a strange state of affairs and one that tells us Van Gaal has limited faith in his players. It also points to problems that will greatly affect United’s transfer strategy this summer.

They’re out of the FA Cup and Manchester United face the hardest run-in of the top-four hopefuls... 

ARSENAL 3RD: West Ham (h) - March 14, Newcastle (a) - March 21, Liverpool (h) - April 4, Burnley (a) - April 11, Sunderland (h) - April 18, Chelsea (h) - April 26, Hull (a) - May 2, Swansea (h) - May 9, Man Utd (a) - May 16, West Brom (h) - May 24

Van Gaal knows he needs a right back, central defender, holding midfielder and a centre forward. That is probably about £150million right there. The Dutch coach also knows, however, that he needs to ease out some very big names to make that happen. Van Gaal has to make decisions about Mata, Falcao, Robin van Persie and Rafael da Silva and that is before he addresses the issue of whether less glamorous types such as Jones, Smalling and Jonny Evans are evergoing to mature into footballers good enough to help United back to the top of the Premier League.

Van Gaal has spoken many times about his squad lacking balance. What he has been understandably less candid about is the fact that it is just not good enough. There are problems with players such as Di Maria that need time and tactical tuning to address. There is, at least, no doubt about his quality. The cross he delivered for Wayne Rooney to equalise on Monday was evidence of that.

Di Maria is not the issue. It is the supporting cast — such as Adnan Januzaj and Ashley Young — that Van Gaal remains unsure about.

At Arsenal, Wenger has his critics. His team remain skittish and unpredictable. Nobody can accuse the Arsenal manager of not knowing his own mind, however. There is a methodical consistency about Wenger that, for better or for worse, is clear from the way he chooses and sets up his teams.

The same cannot be said about Van Gaal. At the United training ground on Wednesday, the increasingly irritable manager will be looking for something new, trying to find yet another way of turning water into wine before Sunday’s home game with Tottenham.

What is unclear though, is whether this constant changing of personnel and tactics tells us more about the limitations of the manager or the players.
