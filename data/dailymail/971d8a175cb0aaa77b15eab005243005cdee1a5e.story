A rise in the number of flies has prompted a run on the unusual Christmas gift of Venus Fly Traps, a report says.

Britain's women are buying the carnivorous plant to give to the men in their lives, says high street retailer Homebase.

Demand has rocketed by 50 per cent, making it one of the fastest selling plants in the UK.Â 

Unusual: Venus Fly Traps, which have the Latin name Dionaea muscipula, trap flies and insects by suddenly closing the spikes of their leaves around them. Demand has risen by 50 per cent this year

Homebase Marketing Director Jo Kenrick said: 'This is fidelity in a plant pot. It's a reminder that trust is essential in every relationship - as well as being an environmentally friendly way to keep pest in your kitchen under control.'

The hidden meaning in the gift of a Venus fly Trap emerged when Homebase carried out customer research into its growing horticultural market.

However, as well as being used to send a message to partners, the recent boom in food waste home composting bins across Britain has also had a huge effect upon demand for the unique fly eating plants.

Experts believe that environmentally aware homeowners are choosing the carnivorous plant to reduce the additional number of flies created by the bins.

Carnivorous: Venus Fly Traps derive all of the food and energy they need for growth from its prey

Venus Fly Traps, which have the Latin name Dionaea muscipula, trap flies and insects by suddenly closing the spikes of their leaves around them. Powerful juices secreted by glands in each leaf then digest the victim while it is still alive.

It is a native of subtropical wetlands on the East Coast of America.

Venus Fly Traps derive all of the food and energy they need for growth from the prey that they catch. Adding fertilizer to the soil can kill it.

Ms Kenrick said: 'Venus Fly Traps take a little while to settle into a new home, but they're can be a much better alternative to insecticides sprays.

'The sudden popularity of Venus Fly Traps shows how British plant tastes are changing. Until comparatively recently, our most popular plants would have been those found in a typical English country garden, with roses, tulips, chrysanthemums and other native plants on the top of everyone's list.

'However, recently we've noticed a move towards less traditional plants, with Australian tree ferns, dwarf palms and olive trees becoming more popular. We believe that the increased number of people taking holiday abroad may be having an effect.

'Seeing exotic plants growing overseas, encourages British people to recreate a little bit of their holiday in their gardens when they return.'
