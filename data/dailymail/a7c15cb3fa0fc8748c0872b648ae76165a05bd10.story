Two gunmen burst through the front door of a house last night and shot a six-year-old boy in the neck in a gun attack in Dublin.

The men pushed their way into the hallway of the house in Croftwood Gardens, Ballyfermot before one of them opened fire.

The youngster was rushed to Crumlin Children's Hospital where he is understood to be in a 'stable condition'.

The incident happened at 10.15pm on Friday and detectives are currently trying to determine a motive for the shooting.

Gardai have confirmed that the child was not the intended target of the gun attack and said they are 'following a definite line of inquiry'.

The scene has been secured by specialists from the Garda Technical Bureau who are conducting a full forensic examination of the scene.

Officers are also canvassing local residents to see if they witnessed anything unusual in the period leading up to the shooting.

A senior officer has been tasked with co-ordinating the investigation.

The two men involved in the shooting are believed to have escaped the scene on bicycle.

A garda spokesman said: 'The shooting occurred shortly after 10pm, a six-year-old boy received what is believed to be a gunshot wound to his neck. When gardai arrived on scene they administered first aid until the arrival of the ambulance.

'The injured boy was taken to Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin. His condition is described as stable and non life-threatening.'

Irish Justice Minister Frances Fitzgerald said: ' I share the shock of the community in Ballyfermot at the appalling shooting of a child last night.  The thoughts and prayers of everyone will be for the recovery of the child.

'Acting Commissioner Noirin O'Sullivan has assured me that the Gardaí are making significant progress with their inquiries and that they are determined to bring to justice those involved in perpetrating this dreadful incident. 

'In that they have the full support of the local community and I would appeal to anyone who has information which could be helpful to the Gardaí to pass this on immediately.

'This incident is a stark reminder of the dangers of a gun culture and the men and women of An Garda Síochána have the full support of the Minister and local communities for the work they do day in day out in counteracting the activities of those who show such a callous disregard for human life.'

Local Sinn Fein councillor Daithi Doolan told Mail Online: 'This is absolutely shocking. My thoughts and prayers are with this young boy and his family.

'I would urge anyone who has any information about this shooting to come forward to gardai.'

Cllr Doolan said residents in the area have recently been complaining about joyriding and other types of criminality.

'We need to work with the local council, gardai and government to bring an end to this type of violence.'
