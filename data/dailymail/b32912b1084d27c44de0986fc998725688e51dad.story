Swansea are in talks to sign Ecuador winger Jefferson Montero from Monarcas Morelia for £4million.

The 24-year-old appeared in all three of his country's World Cup matches as Ecuador were knocked out at the group stage.

The Swans will also listen to offers for £10m-rated Michu.

Spanish frontman Michu made a huge impact during his first year in the Premier League but missed much of last season through injury.

Meanwhile, captain Ashley Williams, 29, has signed a new four-year contract with the south Wales club.
