It is one of the most coveted awards in showbusiness.

But even the stars who don’t win a Oscar at this weekend’s ceremony won’t go home empty handed.

A Los Angeles-based marketing firm will be handing out gift bags worth £45,000 to all the nominees and presenters at the prestigious event on Sunday night.

Ticket to paradise: Even losers at this weekend's Oscars will be winners with a goodie bag that includes a trip to Lizard Island resort on the Great Barrier Reef, pictured, which would usually cost £2,500

Everyone's a winner: A holiday to the Lizard Island resort on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, comes free for stars at this weekend's Oscars, even those who do not win an award

Large 'swag bag': The LA based firm Distinctive Assets will be offering guests at the ceremony a collection like this one, from last year, worth more than $45,000

Free hair products: The 'swag bags' also contain organic shampoo from Phyto

Known as swag bags, among the items 
included are trips to Australia, Hawaii and Mexico, personal training 
sessions, condoms, a bottle of tequila, cosmetic treatments, acupuncture
 sessions and a one-year membership to London’s Heathrow Airport’s 
private VIP service.

The confirmation of condoms in this year’s gift bag has raised eyebrows amongst some.

Guests will also be invited to 
enjoy four night stays at the exclusive Lizard Island resort on the 
Great Barrier Reef, which would usually cost £2,500.

They will also be given free hair 
care products by Phyto, skincare cosmetics by Lierac, a free £600 
facelift procedure and, at the lower end of the scale, a £2 bottle of 
Windex glass cleaning fluid.

It has become something of a 
tradition for A-list stars to receive a treasure chest of goodies at the
 Oscars.

Brands and manufacturers hope that the celebrities will be seen
 wearing or using their products and ensure free publicity.

The gift bags have been put 
together over the past 11 years by US company Distinctive Assets, with 
the cost of the packages having slowly risen.

In 2003, nominees received
 £11,000 worth of items, including mobile phones, cameras, designer 
clothes and jewellery.

The 2004 gift bag included a 
holiday at a luxury resort in Mexico.

Gwyneth Paltrow, who presented an 
award at the Oscars that year, was said to have used the holiday for her
 honeymoon with Coldplay singer Chris Martin.

Actress Calista Flockhart once 
received a Dritti T-shirt in a gift basket from Distinctive Assets and 
loved it so much that she wore it for an entire episode of Ally McBeal.

Similarly, another T-shirt designer saw their gifts end up on Beyonce 
Knowles on the cover of Ebony magazine.

In recent years, stars are said to
 have been worried about alienating recession-hit fans by being seen 
with heavily laden gift bags.

However, Lord of the Rings actor Sir Ian McKellen is one of the stars who has spoken of his delight at his gift haul.

‘They’re the most wonderful goodies,’ he explained. ‘They keep you going for a year.’

Lash Fry, founder of Distinctive 
Assets, said: ‘It’s first come, first served, because we do offer 
product exclusivity.

'We’re always looking for new and unusual products, 
it’s not always about the most expensive.

‘We’ve got things at both ends of 
the spectrum and everything in between, stuff for guys and stuff for 
girls. More is more is our philosophy.’
