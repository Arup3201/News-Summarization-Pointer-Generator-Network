The remains of Gerry and Mary Menke have been formally identified by forensic experts

Forensic experts have formally identified the first remains of Australian victims of the MH17 disaster as Victorian-based couple Mary and Gerry Menke.

The couple were among the 298 people killed when the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 was downed over insurgent-held eastern Ukraine on July 17.

The Menke family said in a statement on Friday they were 'relieved' that Mary and Gerry had been identified.

'We look forward to receiving Mary and Gerry again soon in the place and the community they loved so much and which loved them.

'We wish to thank all those who have helped in this process,' the family said.

Gerry and Mary Menke ran a successful abalone pearl company in Mallacoota, Victoria. Mrs Menke also operated a hairdressing and beauty studio with her daughter.

It is understood they were returning home to Mallacoota after celebrating Gerry's 70th birthday in France when the plane was shot down.

In a statement released by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Menkes' family said 'they will be remembered by everyone who knew them for the vivacity and spirit with which they lived.'

'They were inseparable partners in everything they did, loyal friends, deeply loving siblings and children, devoted parents to four children and doting grandparents to five grandsons.'

The couple (pictured) are the first of 38 Australian victims to have been identified nearly a month after the plane crash

Gerry Menke was from the Netherlands, born in Hilversum in 1944.Â  He was one of six siblings who immigrated to Australian in 1953.The 70-year-old's fascination with the ocean from a young age led to a successful and lifelong career in the abalone industry, in which he was a diver for 35 years before focusing his efforts on the pearl business.

Mary came from Bignell in rural Christchurch and was working in an Australian pub when she met Gerry during her working holiday around the country. She was 65-years-old.

'Mary was a woman as colourful in spirit as she was in appearance,' the Menke family said. 'Her easy smile and laugh were as bright as the shock of blonde curls piled on her head.'

After a 'whirlwind romance', the couple were married in Mary's home country of New Zealand and 'rarely spent a day apart', said family.

Mary and Gerry are survived by their four children - Sara, Brett, Anna and Paul - along with their extended families.

The Menke family sent their deepest condolences to those affected by the tragedy.

Dutch forensic experts have so far identified 127 victims. Most of the identified victims have been Dutch but other nationalities have been publicly revealed, including from Malaysia, UK, New Zealand, Canada, Belgium and Germany.

It is Australian government policy to keep the nationality of formally identified Australian victims secret unless the family is happy for it to be published.

A total of 38 Australians were killed in the disaster.
