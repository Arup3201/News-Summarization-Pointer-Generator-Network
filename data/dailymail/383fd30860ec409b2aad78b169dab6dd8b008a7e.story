Kidnapping victim Hannah Anderson broke down in tears as she defended herself today over letters and texts she sent to her abductor in her first interview since she was rescued in the Idaho wilderness.

In an interview with the Today show, she remarked on how 'cruel' people had been because of her decision to talk about the ordeal online, saying: 'In the beginning, I was a victim. But now knowing everyone out there’s helping me, I consider myself a survivor instead.'

The 16-year-old also clarified some details about what her relationship with kidnapper James DiMaggio was like and why they exchanged 13 text messages on the day he abducted her after killing her mother and brother.

Denying that it was phone calls they exchanged, Hannah said the 13 texts were regarding arrangements to pick her up from cheer camp, explaining where exactly she would be and the address.

Emotional: Hannah broke down in tears as she talked about her brother Ethan, saying he had a good heart

Hannah Anderson told the Today show: 'There are gonna be harder times in life but if I can get through this I can get through a lot more'

Survivor: Hannah said she will tell her entire story eventually, but now is not the time to do it

According to search warrants, Anderson exchanged about 13 phone calls with DiMaggio before she was picked up from cheerleading practice that day.

The San Diego County Sheriff's said it could not immediately explain the discrepancy.

Authorities have also said that letters from Anderson were found at the home. Anderson said that they were written about a year ago when she was having trouble getting along with her mother and she sought advice from DiMaggio. 

'Me and him would talk about how to deal with it,' she said. 'And I’d tell him how I felt about it. And he helped me through it. They weren’t anything bad. They’re just to help me through tough times.'

Explaining why she chose to go on social media after her rescue and the subsequent backlash at her decision to do so, she said: 'I didn't know people could be so cruel. I connect to friends through Facebook and Instagram.

'It helps me to grieve 
to post pictures and tell people how I am feeling. I'm a teenager, I'm gonna go on it.

'It's going be a little overwhelming 
returning to school with people and their opinion but I know a lot of my friends will have my back.

'There are gonna be harder times in life but if I can get through this I can get through a lot more.'

She broke down when talking about her brother Ethan, saying he had a 'really good heart' and said her mom was strong-hearted and very tough.

'She knew how to handle things', she said.

As for the future, Hannah said she wants to be a firefighter in San Diego.

She said support from her friends and family has allowed her to cope with the harrowing ordeal, which saw her rescued by the FBI Hostage Rescue team in the Idaho wilderness August 10 after agents shot and killed DiMaggio, who had held her captive for a week.

'In the beginning, I was a victim but now, knowing everyone out there who is helping me, I'd consider myself a survivor, instead,' she said.

She credited the Amber Alert system, which helped spread the word about her kidnapping, with saving her life.

Four horseback riders who encountered her and DiMaggio in the River of No Return Wilderness called police after seeing her face on the TV news as part of an Amber Alert that extended into Idaho. Their tip led the FBI to DiMaggio.

Friend say DiMaggio, 40, had a 'crush' on Hannah and once told her that he would date her if he were a teenager.

Investigators
still don't know what drove him to murder Hannah's family and abduct 
her - taking her on a 1,000 mile road trip that ended August 10. 

Police say DiMaggio, one of Christina Anderson's closest friends, invited Christina, Hannah and Ethan to stay at his house in Boulevard, California, on August 3. He told them that he was leaving town and moving to Texas.

That night, he killed Christina and Ethan. Autopsy results show Christina was tortured and then bashed in the head. He also shot their family dog, Cali.

He then rigged his house with arson wire and set it to burn down 20 hours after he left. Border patrol cameras spotted DiMaggio and Hannah in his blue Nissan Versa car about 12.10am August 4.

Police weren't called to his house until later that night when it caught fire.

For six days, police hunted for DiMaggio and Hannah. Authorities issued and Amber Alert for California almost immediately and informed border patrol agents at the Mexican border.

Later, the alert was extended to Washington and Oregon after drivers reported seeing DiMaggio's Versa heading north toward the Canadian border.

The
family of James DiMaggio, who kidnapped Hannah Anderson after killing 
her mother and brother, are asking for a DNA test because they believe 
he is her biological father.

A
spokesman for James DiMaggio's family made the request after it was 
revealed he left $112,000 to Hannah's grandmother, who he named as the 
sole beneficiary of his life insurance policy.

DiMaggio, who was like an uncle to the 
Anderson children and their father's best friend, died in a shootout 
with FBI agents on August 10 in the Idaho wilderness six days after he set fire to his home.

Hannah
was rescued and returned to Southern California. Her eight-year-old 
brother Ethan and mother Christina died from blunt force trauma.

Andrew Spanswick told 10News.com: 'He expected the grandmother to take care of the two children with the 
money. He stated he did not want it to go to their parents because they 
were having marital problems and he didn't trust them with the money on 
their own.

'We are requesting DNA samples from 
Hannah and anything they can get from Ethan. There are rumors Jim was 
the children's real father.

'The parents didn't marry until 2002. We think it's strange he left them so much money with no explanation.'

He also described Hannah's behavior as suspicious saying: 'Some things that Hannah is saying on her Facebook doesn't add up so far; her latest posts are disturbing.'

It is unclear what these Facebook posts are.

Stacy Hess, a spokesperson for Brett Anderson, said in a statement: 'Brett and Tina Anderson did not meet Mr DiMaggio until the sixth month of Tina’s pregnancy with Hannah.

'Brett Anderson’s DNA was used to identify the body of his dead son Ethan Anderson.'

And David Braun, Tina Anderson's uncle, reacted angrily to the idea.

'I would tell them to shut up with their accusations and their implications up until after the funeral, until after my precious Tina and precious Ethan are buried -- the family members that your family murdered,' Braun said.

When four horseback riders came across the 
16-year-old in the Idaho wilderness with DiMaggio they said she did not 
seem to be under duress. She later claimed it was all an act as she did not want to endanger them.

They later tipped off police, leading to the rescue of the teen and the shooting death of DiMaggio.

Search warrants unsealed last week said Hannah was picked up from a cheerleading practice at 4pm on August 4, but Caldwell said the practice was a day earlier.

Firefighters found the body of Christina Anderson, 44, when they extinguished flames at DiMaggio's home in Boulevard, a tiny town about 65 miles east of San Diego on the U.S.-Mexico border.

A spokeswoman for the family said: 'Brett Anderson’s DNA was used to identify the body of his dead son Ethan Anderson'

What remained: Firefighters found the bodies of 
Christina and Ethan Anderson covered with tarp, showing that they were 
killed before the fire that burnt down Jim DiMaggio's Boulevard cabin

A search warrant says she was found near a crowbar and what appeared to be blood next to her head.

The San Diego County Medical 
Examiner's Office said she died of a blunt head injury, without 
elaborating on the nature of the wound or the circumstances of her death
in a posting to its website. The manner of death is listed as homicide.

Investigators found eight-year-old Ethan Anderson's body as they sifted through rubble. Authorities identified his remains several days later by extracting DNA from his bone marrow.

The medical examiner's office said on Tuesday the cause and manner of the boy's death remained under investigation.

Hannah Anderson says she didn't learn her mother and brother died until after she was rescued. She said on a social media site last week that she was 'on the road to Idaho' when the fire ignited.

'He had set to wear (sic) it would catch on fire at a certain time,' she wrote.

A memorial service is scheduled Saturday for the mother and son in Santee, an east San Diego suburb.
