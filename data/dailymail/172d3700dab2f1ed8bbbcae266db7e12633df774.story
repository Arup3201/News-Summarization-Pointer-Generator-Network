A controversial new adapter for the iPhone 5 which users will have to buy in order to continue using Apple accessories will cost at least £18, it has emerged.

The new phone, which was unveiled in San Francisco on Wednesday, includes a 
controversial new 'docking connector' which will render thousands of 
Apple accessories obsolete.

The newer, slimline port means that 
thousands of current Apple accessories will need a new 
adapter to work with the phone -  or become unusable.

According
to the website Gizmodo, the new 'Lightning to 30-pin' adapter will 
cost about £18 while a 0.2m cable version of the adapter will cost about £24.

With
the new model, Apple is ditching the docking port connector it's used 
for iPods, iPhones and iPads for nearly a decade in favor of a smaller, 
narrower one.

The newer, slimline port means that 
thousands of current Apple accessories will need a potentially clunky 
adapter to work with the 'iPhone 5' - or become unusable.

There will be adapters 
available so that the new phone will be able to connect to sound docks 
and other accessories designed for the old phones.

Pricey: The cheapest version of the adapter will cost about £18

Speaking at today's launch, Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said:

‘The
iPhone from its start used the 30 pin connector, and it has served us 
well. A lot has changed and it is time for the connector to evolve - and
our new connector is called Lightning.’

Many fans were
left angry last month when images allegedly showing the iPhone 5's new design 
leaked out, showing the traditional 30-pin dock connector - used for 
charging, syncing files and pumping audio to hi-fis - had been 
re-designed into a smaller shape.

The new 'Lightning' dock: While providing 
somewhat of a disconnect for previous users, the new port is faster and
can be plugged in either way up
