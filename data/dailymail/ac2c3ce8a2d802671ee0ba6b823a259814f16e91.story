Santi Cazorla became the latest footballer to commemorate his FA Cup moment by nabbing one of the pitchside photographer's cameras to capture the special occasion.

In the aftermath of Arsenal's dramatic 3-2 victory against Hull City at Wembley, the Spanish playmaker - who scored a stunning free-kick to spark the Gunners' comeback - sneakily borrowed Back Page Image's Kieran McManus' lens to snap a few shots of the celebrations.

The 29-year-old, wearing an Arsenal scarf wrapped around his head, ignored the temptation for yet another footballer selfie, to take a picture of match winner Aaron Ramsey striking a victory pose with Tomas Rosicky.

McManus was unaware that Cazorla had used his camera until afterwards. He said: 'After photographing Arsenal lift the trophy and celebrate with their fans I went to collect my remote camera from behind the goal and had realised it had been moved.

'Wondering why, I looked back through the images on the memory card to see if I'd captured any of the goals when I realised that somebody had picked it up and used it to photograph some of the Arsenal players celebrating.

'It wasn't until I got back into the photographers room that somebody told me that it was in fact Santi Cazorla who had turned from goalscorer to photographer! Although the pictures are bit soft I think for his first effort he's done ok!'

The photographer's boss, Javier Garcia MD of Back Page Images, remarked: 'Players picking up cameras from behind the goal to take images of their team-mates after winning important matches at Wembley has become almost as commonplace as selfies, but they are still intriguing images as it gives you an insight into how they might approach photography were the tables ever turned.'

'For the majority of the season, interaction between players and photographers on match-days is almost non-existent yet they all know we are there waiting to capture thepositive, negative, quirky and spectacular moments, so it is fascinating to see what they produce.

'Although Cazorla's images won't win any photographic awards, his attempts to photograph his team mates are probably better than Kieran's attempts at scoring from long-range free kicks in a Cup Final!'

But, this isn't the first time that a player has made use of a photographer's cameras. At the Wembley semi-final, Hull winger Ahmed Elmohamady also stepped behind the lens.

After his side beat 
League One's Sheffield United, Elmohamady took Sportsmail's very own award-winning snapper Graham Chadwick's unit from behind the goal and 
began clicking away.

The final shots are perhaps less composed than Cazorla's efforts, but still likely to make his own personal photo album.

However, the most memorable act of camera theft must be Jamaican sprint legend Usain Bolt's typically showman celebration after wining gold at the 2012 London Olympics.

After crossing the finishing line ahead of compatriots Yohan Blake and Warren Weir, the 25-year-old 
dropped to the track and performed press-ups, before borrowing a 
photographer camera to take souvenir snapshots of the occasion.

We suspect the final shots were taken for 'express' development.
