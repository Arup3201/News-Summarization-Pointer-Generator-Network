His family released a statement outlining their loss: 'James Stephenson was a true family man, married to Lisa with two daughters, Faith, aged three, and Ellie, seven months. He was the second child of Kevin and Caroline, a brother to Claire and Ben, and his sudden premature death has shocked them all.

'He was head chef at Applegarth Farm in Grayshott where he has led the development of the business over the last two and a half years. He was a keen golfer and an avid supporter of Leeds United Football Club.

'He will be remembered for his willingness to always help others and as a wonderful son to Caroline and Kevin, as a devoted husband to Lisa and father to Faith and Ellie.'

A 33-year-old man from Waterlooville has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by driving without due care and attention.

A Hampshire police spokeswoman said that the investigation into the circumstances of the accident was ongoing.

The incident is one of three in the past week in which cyclists have died.

Also on New Year's Day, at about 4am, a 23-year-old man died after he was in collision with a Ford Focus car on the A259 Grand Parade, St Leonards, East Sussex.

Three men and a boy, were arrested later during the day, all on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.

And on December 28, a 79-year-old cyclist, Michael Long - of Hop Gardens, Fairwarp, East Sussex, died after he was in collision on the A22 at Nutley with a Renault Megane being driven by a 32-year-old man from East Grinstead.
