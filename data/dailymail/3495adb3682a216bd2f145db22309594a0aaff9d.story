Doctors have told three-time Indianapolis 500 champion Dario Franchitti that he can no longer race because of injuries he sustained in an Indycar crash in Houston last month.

Franchitti, 40, fractured his spine, broke his right ankle and suffered a concussion in the October 6 crash, which occurred when he made contact with another car and hurtled into a fence.

He underwent two surgeries on his ankle and recently returned home to Scotland to recover.

He announced his departure from the sport in a statement he shared on Twitter, calling today 'a sad day - but I'm eternally grateful'.

'One month removed from the crash and
based upon the expert advice of the doctors who have treated and 
assessed my head and spinal injuries, it is their best medical opinion 
that I must stop racing,' he explained in the statement.

'They
have made it very clear that the risks involved in further racing are 
too great and could be detrimental to my long term well-being. Based on 
this medical advice, I have no choice but to stop.'

Franchitti added that he hoped to stay involved with the team to help in any capacity he could.

It
has been a troubled year for the driver, who split with his wife, 
actress Ashley Judd, in January. After the crash it was reported that 
they were going to give their 13-year marriage another try.

An insider told Us Weekly: 'They are 
going to give it another try after he recovers. His accident made her 
realize how much she loves him.'

The three-car smash happened in one of
the sharp turns and also involved Japan's Takuma Sato and E.J. Viso of 
Venezuela. The two other drivers were able to leave their cars and walk 
away.

The Scottish racer's 
car went airborne at over 100 mph into the safety fencing and causing it
to spin several times against the fence, firing debris into the 
grandstands and injuring 13 spectators.

Sato said that his car had clipped the wall before Franchitti's car collided with his.

Safe: Franchitti is pulled from the wreckage after the crash. He was alert and flown to hospital

'On the last lap I caught the marbles and brushed the wall and lost 
momentum,' Sato said. 'A couple cars passed me as I was off line and in 
Turn 5. I got very loose and Dario and I came together.'

Franchitti
was filmed moving in the aftermath of the 
crash while safety stewards dashed to offer assistance. His team owner 
Chip Ganassi said Franchitti was 'awake and alert' in the helicopter.

Senior
Captain Ruy Lozana of the Houston Fire Department said that two of the 
13 spectators were sent to hospital while the rest were fine to be 
treated at the scene.

Franchitti was taken to a hospital near Reliant Park in Houston to be treated.
