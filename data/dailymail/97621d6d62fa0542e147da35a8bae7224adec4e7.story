With cast-iron Le Creuset saucepans, a six-hob oven and a Bosch dishwasher, Cat Fletcher’s kitchen would be the envy of many.

So it may be a surprise to learn she did not pay a penny for any of those items – nor, indeed, for almost everything else in her well-equipped home.

Amazingly, she has furnished the three-bedroom semi in Newhaven, East Sussex, to an impressive standard for free by scouring websites where people give away their unwanted items.

As well as sofas, cushions, cutlery, clothing and linen, mother-of-three Miss Fletcher, 49, has also managed to pick up a 15ft palm tree, which would have cost £1,000 to buy, for the garden, and a sailboard for windsurfing.

She also frequents charity shops on the look-out for bargains – and once found a brand-new £900 Habitat sideboard in a skip.

It has taken her five years, and everything might not match, but the end result is akin to the fashionable ‘shabby chic’ style which some fork out thousands to achieve.

Miss Fletcher, who estimates she has 
saved at least £20,000 by her unconventional approach, said: ‘I don’t 
think there is any shame in it. I feel it is more shameful to be a 
consumer and be all hoity-toity about it than to do what I do.’

She is among the growing number of people in ‘austerity Britain’ to have joined Freegle, an online community with 1.4million members nationally.

On its website, people advertise 
items they want to give away, with the only condition usually that the 
person who wants it has to collect it.

Miss
Fletcher, who has 18-year-old twin daughters and a 21-year-old son, 
said: ‘There is a misconception that it’ll be junk but a lot of affluent
people give things away, perhaps because they are changing the colour 
scheme of their home or because they are moving and a piece of furniture
doesn’t fit in their new place.

‘It may be costly for them to have it taken away or put into storage, so both sides benefit.

‘The
monetary value of the items is not important to me. We’ve had things 
which we would never have had otherwise, but what matters to me is that 
it is something which I need and which still has some useful life left 
in it.

‘Some
people are maybe too proud to do what I do, but I’d say to them that 
there are lots of different levels of second hand. People don’t think 
twice about buying furniture from antique shops and auctions, for 
example.’

A keen environmentalist, she was 
formerly a personal assistant to a university academic but was made 
redundant 18 months ago and says her thriftiness helped her survive 
that.

Her
skill at bargain home-furnishing also recently helped her to secure a 
six-month contract working as a resource co-ordinator for Brighton 
University on an  arts project.

Miss
Fletcher, who emigrated from Australia in 1997, said: ‘Five years ago 
many people would have turned their noses up at free items. But people 
are more conscious of getting value for money since the recession hit 
and considering where they are spending their income.

‘I
can maintain my home without it eating into income for food and raising
three kids. Living the way I do allows me to live comfortably but 
within my means.’

The
plasma television in her sitting room was a gift from relatives, and 
when she does make a purchase – she bought an iPhone, for example – she 
says she ‘always goes for quality’ and does not replace things just 
because an updated model comes out.
