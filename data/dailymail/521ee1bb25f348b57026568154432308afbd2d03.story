In addition to burrito bowls, Chipotle is now serving food for the soul as well.

The chain started publishing the works of famous writers on their take-out cups and bags on Thursday.

Author Jonathan Safran Foer came up with the idea for the fast-food flash-fictions while eating at a Chipotle restaurant, having forgot to bring a book or his smart phone to entertain him.

'I really just wanted to die with frustration,' Foer told Vanity Fair of the boring experience.

Foer knew Chipotle CEO Steve Ells, and pitched him the idea in an email.

'I said, "I bet a shitload of people go into your restaurants every day, and I bet some of them have very similar experiences, and even if they didn’t have that negative experience, they could have a positive experience if they had access to some kind of interesting text,"' Foer recalled.

Ells went for it, and let Foer take charge of editing. In the end, he convinced writers Toni Morrison and George Saunders to get on board as well as journalists Malcolm Gladwell and Michael Lewis.

'I selected the writers, and insofar as there was any editing, I did it,' Foer said.

'I tried to put together a somewhat eclectic group, in terms of styles. I wanted some that were essayistic, some fiction, some things that were funny, and somewhat thought provoking.'

The new 'Cultivating Thought' cups debut Thursday, but Morrison, Foer and Lewis' contributions can be read now on Vanity Fair's website.

Foer's collaboration with a fast-food chain is somewhat surprising considering he wrote 'Eating Animals', an indictment of mass food production in the United States, and is a vegetarian. 

However, he says the opportunity to get good writing into the hands of 800,000 Americans was a great opportunity.

'A lot of those people don’t have access to libraries, or bookstores. Something felt very democratic and good about this.'

But Foer said the opportunity to get literature into the hands of 800,000 Americans was too good too miss
