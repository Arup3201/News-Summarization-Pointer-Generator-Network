Authorities across the country are on high alert this week following the death of Melbourne teenager Numan Haider, who was shot dead by police after he stabbed two officers.

Haider was known to police, had been seen in his local area brandishing an ISIS flag and recently had his passport cancelled over security concerns. 

A spokesperson for Victoria police told Daily Mail Australia 13,000 officers received a message from Chief Commissioner Ken Lay on Tuesday night.

Officers were urged to 'exercise caution throughout their shift' in light of the attack on two counter terrorism officers outside Endeavour Hills station in Melbourne's south-east on Tuesday evening.

The note warned police to be on the lookout and prepared for any situation.

NSW Police also sent a message to all of their staff urging them to remain vigilant following the incident.

Released via the internal communications system, officers were warned in the memo to be on alert and cautious following events in the last week - which also included the country's largest ever terror raids.

This comes as it was announced officers in Queensland could soon be able to take weapons home with them, as part of new safety measures being implemented to protect the force.

'If the risk is there, we'll be very sympathetic to requests,' Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart said, according to the Daily Telegraph.

In additional to extra measures being in placed for authorities, security at this weekend's AFL grand-final will be increased with scores of undercover police attending the game.

The match will take place at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday, and Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Ken Lay has asked people to be reassured by the beefed-up police presence rather that frightened by it.

Commissioner Lay said recent events should not be detterent for people who were planning to attend the game and that he hopes people will 'enjoy this weekend as Victorians have always celebrated their grand final footy' The Australian reported.

There were already security plans put in place before Haider's death, in light of the recently increased terror threat which was pushed up to high this month.
