Earlier this week Princess Beatrice visited the RHS Chelsea Flower Show with the Queen. And it seems the floral exhibits gave her style inspiration as she attended the first garden party of the season at Buckingham Palace today.

The Queen's granddaughter wore a colourful flower print skirt with a long sleeve cream blouse with an embellished collar and gold buttons.

She continued the floral theme with her headwear, wearing a fascinator topped with a cream rose designed by Welsh milliner Robyn Coles.

The outfit was a safe bet for the 25-year-old who isn't always praised for her fashion choices. Most famously, she was mocked around the world for the unusual Philip Treacy-designed fascinator she wore to her cousin Prince William's wedding to Kate Middleton.

When it came to her footwear today, she seems to have taken her cue from another Middleton - Pippa - who recently advised against wearing heels to an event on grass.

The sister of the Duchess of Cambridge offered her pearls of wisdom in the June edition of Vanity Fair, referring to the best way to dress for a day at Ascot.

She wrote: 'It is a busy day trying to fit in horse racing, betting, picnics, and afternoon tea - oh, and avoiding sinking your heels into the grass. I recommend wedged shoes - there's often a lot of walking.'

Her sister, Kate, is another firm fan of wedges and is frequently pictured in a pair.

The sensible foorwear was definitely needed for Princess Beatrice as she spent time on her feet mingling with some of the hundreds of guests invited to the palace event.

The Queen was also in attendance wearing a matching lavender coat and dress designed by Angela Kelly.

She was joined by the Duke of Edinburgh who was in good form despite recently needing medical attention.

It was revealed today that the Duke has had a 'minor procedure' carried out on his right hand that required him to wear a bandage - but didn't stop him carrying on with royal business as usual.
