Growing up with a parent who suffers from depression is never easy but for Becky, 14, from Hull, things became considerably worse when her mother lost her job as well.

So strapped for cash did the family become, Becky and her younger sister Rosie, eight, found themselves with less than £1.50 a day to spend on food.

But despite the difficulties, Becky, who is determined to find a way to make a better life for herself and her sister, has taken the first step on the road to becoming an artist.

Talented: Becky dreams of becoming a Manga artist and making a better life for herself

The budding cartoonist spent a week with Japanese artist Chie Kutsuwada learning how to create Manga comic strips, following a stint spent filming new Channel 4 documentary, Children on the Breadline.

'It’s been 
difficult,' explains the 14-year-old of her straitened upbringing. 'I mean sometimes, mum has sold her own necklaces and family 
items. 

'She can’t get those things back. It’s like selling memories, 
it’s just not right.'

Worse still, says the teen, was becoming one of the estimated 300,000 children per year who are forced to rely on food banks to eat.

'I 
was really on edge with the idea,' she reveals. 'I didn’t want to be fixed with the 
label ”poor person”, as a couple more stereotypes are thrown in with 
that — like poor personal hygene, and that’s something I take pride in.

'Using the food bank felt a little bit embarrassing, but when my mother came home with a huge gigantic
 smile on her face, it felt a little less daunting.

'After going to the 
food bank we’ve made a couple of new friends and I’m very grateful for 
what we have.'

Food banks and food aid charities gave 
more than 20 million meals last year to people in the UK who could not 
afford to feed themselves – a 54 per cent increase on the previous 12 
months, according to a report by Oxfam, Church Action on
 Poverty and The Trussell Trust.

'The
 troubling reality is that there are also thousands more people 
struggling with food poverty who have no access to food aid, or are too 
ashamed to seek help, as well as a large number of people who are only 
just coping by eating less and buying cheap food,' comments Chris Mould, chairman of The Trussell Trust.

'Trussell
 Trust food banks are seeing parents skipping meals to feed their 
children and significant repercussions of food poverty on physical and 
mental health.'

Becky, however, is one of the lucky ones and is determined not to make the same mistakes as her parents.

'I
 want to break the cycle, I want to make sure I have a decent future for
 myself and my own family,' she reveals.

'I wanted to be a manga understudy either for 
some manga company. Just be an understudy. Help illustrate stuff.

'I’ve 
been drawing for as long as I can remember. It can be a release. I mean 
you can draw your emotions on a sheet of paper, sometimes you can’t 
write them down, you can’t speak them but you can definitely draw them 
on paper.'

And while studying Manga in Hull has proved difficult, her time spent studying with Manga cartoonist Kutswada has already given her a boost.

'My mum seems brighter than usual 
and I hope she keeps it up,' she says rather poignantly. 'I love this new feeling, and I remain just 
as optimistic as ever!'

Becky appears on Children on the Breadline, tonight at 7.30pm on Channel 4
