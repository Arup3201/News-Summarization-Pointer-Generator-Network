Twiggy is back with a new Autumn/Winter collection for Marks and Spencer and the model-turned-fashion-designer says there something for everyone in the range.

Speaking to the MailOnline she said: 'I hate it when they put an age to clothes. Obviously I am not going to go around in gold hot pants any more but there are items in the new collection that women of all ages will love.

'I do my collections for all age groups, it's not just meant for someone my age. My daughter wears a lot of my jackets.'

This season's must-haves: The model shows off some of the coats on offer including this biker jacket with a fold back collar, left, and faux fur winter warmer 

The 64-year-old said she took inspiration from her own wardrobe in creating the new range, while also including updated versions of items that have previously been big hits, such as the flattering pink lace dress she wore to her daughter's wedding, which will now be available in jade.

She's also been sure to include many dresses and tops with long or short sleeves following demand from women who say they feel more confident covering their upper arms up. 

Twiggy said: 'There are certain areas which are bothersome for most women and that's top of the arms and the tummy. I feel much more comfortable myself with a little sleeve.'

For all ages: Animal and floral prints are a feature as Twiggy advises being brave when it comes to style 

When it comes to looking good, Twiggy had the following style tips: 'Every women is built differently, the thing is to find your comfort zone, sometimes you have to be brave and try things out but don't go stupid and wear things that won't flatter you.

'It helps if you can go shopping with someone you trust. I take my daughter and she'll be honest with me.'

The designer added that her wardrobe staples have evolved rather than changed over the decades.

'My style hasn't really changed that much of the years,' she revealed. 'I still love tailored jackets like the one in my new collection. I would wear it with skinny jeans but if you don't feel comfortable in them you could wear them with a pleated or pencil shirt. 

'There's also a navy blue riding jacket I based on one in my wardrobe which I have always loved. I love that I can reinvent things doing my own designs.' 

Versatile: Twiggy said many of the items can be dress up or down

The new collection, which is exclusively on sale from www.marksandspencer.com/Twiggy from 10th September, includes faux fur coats, animal print jumpers and pretty embellished tops and dresses.

Accessories include wearable mid heel courts and classic brogues in vibrant colours, along with statement totes and stylish shoulder bags. 

Bold colours of pink and jade feature throughout and Twiggy said many of the items can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion.

'My comfort zone is skinny jeans and jackets but I also know a lot of women love dresses so we have lots of then', she explained. 'There's a drapey jersey dress and that's the sort you could wear to the office. Then in the evening you can put on a necklace and heels and go straight to a party!'

Twiggy looks glowing as she poses for pictures of the collection and she said it's all thanks to her healthy lifestyle. 

'I'm a firm believer that you are what you eat,' she said. 'I don't diet but I like to eat healthily. I don't think big diets work. Everyone I know who has been on a diet loses weight but then puts it straight back on again. I think it's better to eat what you like but not so often. 

'I love chocolate but I'll just have it occasionally. If I said to myself "you can't have chocolate", I would think about it constantly!'

She also said she keeps in shape by doing pilates and tap dancing.

'It's a form of exercise that people don't think of but it's really good for you,' she said of tap dancing. 'It burn calories and is mathematical so use your brain and you look and feel like Fred Astaire!'
