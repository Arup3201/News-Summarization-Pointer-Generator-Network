Artur Mierzejewski, 34, saved a man from drowning on the East River

A Good Samaritan braved choppy East River waters on Monday to rescue a man who wanted to do the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge in the river but nearly drowned instead.

Artur Mierzejewski, 34, told DNAinfo New York that he was walking through the Gantry Plaza State Park about 8pm. He noticed a group of three men in their twenties at the end of the Queens park's pier.

One of them yelled 'ALS challenge' and jumped off the pier, the news website reported.

But soon the man started to realized he couldn't swim back.

He yelled to a friend that he was having a hard time getting back to the pier. The man attempted a rescue but couldn't get very far himself.

Mierzejewski had to act.

'I knew that feeling,' Mierzejewski, who nearly drowned in Poland when he was 8, told DNAinfo. 'I could not just watch this guy drown and not help.'

He jumped into the river and started to pull the man out.Â 

'I thought I was not going to make it,' Mierzejewski told DNAinfo.

'His head would sometimes slip under the water, and he was pulling me down with him,' he added. 'But once we made it to the pillar (of the pier), I heard police sirens and I knew we were going to be okay."

Once they were close to the pier, detective Andrew Perbse jumped in.

A crowd gathered to watch as Mierzejewski tried to pull the man from the East River

'I jumped down into the water, grabbed the two men, made sure they had 
their life ring, and the other guy had the pylon and just told them we 
were going to get them out of the water,' Sperber told ABC 7.

The two simmers were taken to a hospital with minor injuries, NBC 4 reported. Mierzejewski refused treatment.

But he made sure to share a thought with the man he saved.

'I guess you're not going to do anything that 
stupid again,' Mierzejewski told him, according to DNAinfo.

'For sure not,' he replied.

Rescuers eventually pulled Mierzejewski and the men he rescued from the water

The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge is an effort to raise awareness for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, which is a debilitating neurological disease.

In the challenge, participants douse themselves with a bucket of iced water and challenge their friends to do the same.

The ALS Association has so far received $79.7 million in donations since July 29.

It provides cares for people suffering from ALS and supports research to find a cure.
