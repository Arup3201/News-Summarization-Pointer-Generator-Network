Three teenage boys have been jailed for the fatal bashing of a 16-year-old boy who was lured to a bush reserve during a staged drug deal.

Quinn De Campe died the day after being bashed, kneed and kicked by the three teens in Balga bushland in Perth's north in December  last year.

But the sentence handed to the trio of teenagers is 'irrelevant' because it won't bring back their only son, his parents say.

Judge Denis Reynolds sentenced the three attackers on Thursday to six and a half years in jail for manslaughter, to be served concurrently with a four year sentence for aggravated armed robbery.

The fourth boy was sentenced to three-and-a-half years behind bars.

'The sentence is irrelevant - nothing is going to change what's happened,' Quinn's father Vaughan De Campe told reporters outside court.

But he and wife Shelley said it was important to discourage and hopefully diminish such senseless crimes, seen all too often on the streets.

'Quinn grew up to believe that people's differences were to be celebrated and not judged. Ultimately, it led to him losing his life,' they said.

'Regardless of the sentence handed down today, it will never change the fact that our son has lost his life in a cowardly and brutal attack that was perpetrated by juveniles.

'It is us and our family that will live with this life sentence. Nothing will ever take away the pain of losing Quinn, our only child.'

Judge Reynolds said the offending was an extremely serious example of its kind because Quinn had been lured to an isolated location and left there severely injured after being outnumbered three to one.

'The three of you were persistent,' he said.

'The three of you were unrelenting.

'Your whole focus was to get the money.'

When they lured Quinn to the bush reserve and - brandishing a broken bottle - The teens assaulted him after he refused to give up his belongings, which included $175 to buy the cannabis.

Quinn was punched, kneed and kicked so hard it left a shoe imprint on his head and caused his attacker to limp.

Quinn was declared brain dead and died from traumatic brain injury the following day

He was chased down when he tried to run away and was found bleeding, bruised and unconscious. He was declared brain dead and died from traumatic brain injury the following day in hospital.

His attackers, who were around the same age, were initially charged with grievous bodily harm but that was later upgraded to murder.

They last month pleaded guilty to manslaughter - a plea bargain accepted by the prosecution.

Along with the fourth boy, they also pleaded guilty to aggravated armed robbery.

Judge Reynolds said all the offenders had been initially remorseless, with one lying 'big time' to police.

They had all developed remorse during the 11 months they have already served at Banksia Hill Juvenile Detention Centre, but in each case, that was overlaid with regret for the impact on themselves, he said.

All will be eligible for parole after serving half of their terms.
