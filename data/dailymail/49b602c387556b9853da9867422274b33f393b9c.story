The Supreme Court of Alabama has ordered the state's probate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to gay couples in the latest development in a fierce battle over the power of federal law.

In its ruling on Tuesday evening, the all-Republican court said a previous federal ruling stating that banning same-sex marriage violates the US Constitution does not prevent it from following state law.

In Alabama, marriage has been legally defined as the union of only one man and one woman for two centuries, it said, siding with an argument recently offered by a pair of conservative organizations.

'Alabama probate judges have a ministerial duty not to issue any marriage license contrary to this law. Nothing in the United States Constitution alters or overrides this duty', the court added.

The state's probate judges now have five days to file a letter stating why they should not have to adhere to the court's decision, according to ABC.

Six justices concurred in Tuesday's 134-page opinion, which was not signed. However, the court's most outspoken opponent of gay marriage, Chief Justice Roy Moore, recused himself. 

Last month, two conservative groups appealed a decision by District Judge Callie Granade of Mobile, who ruled that Alabama's constitutional and statutory bans on gay marriage were unconstitutional.

Immediately after Granade's ruling, Moore told probate judges across the state they were not obliged to issue same-sex marriage licenses. His stance created widespread confusion among judges.

Some refused to issue the licenses to engaged same-sex couples, while others shut down their operations for all couples, gay and straight, until they could get a clear answer.

Justice Jim Main agreed with the result but said he has concerns about procedural aspects 'of this highly unusual case'.

In a dissent, Justice Greg Shaw said it was 'unfortunate' that federal courts refused to delay gay marriage in the state until the US Supreme Court could settle the issue nationally.

But, Shaw said, the state Supreme Court does not have the power to consider the issue.

The court released the decision while Gov. Robert Bentley and most state leaders were assembled in Montgomery for the state of the state address.

Bentley's spokesman said the administration was reviewing the decision and had no comment.

Joe Godfrey, executive director of the Alabama Citizens Action Program, said he was 'very excited' about the decision blocking judges from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

'We are concerned about the family and the danger that same-sex marriage will have. It will be a devastating blow to the family, which is already struggling,' Godfrey said.

He added the ruling will give 'some stability' in Alabama until the Supreme Court rules later this year.

However, lawyers representing same-sex couples seeking the right to marry in Alabama said the court showed 'callous disregard' in its decision.

It added that the court overstepped its bounds by declaring that Alabama's ban on same-sex marriages is constitutional, something the justices had not been asked to consider.

'It is deeply unfortunate that even as nationwide marriage equality is on the horizon, the Alabama Supreme Court is determined to be on the wrong side of history,' said Shannon Minter, legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights.

The court's decision Tuesday came in response to a request from the Alabama Policy Institute and the Baptist-run Alabama Citizens Action Program to halt same-sex unions after Granade's ruling.

Gay marriage has been legalized in at least 36 US states, as well as the District of Columbia.
