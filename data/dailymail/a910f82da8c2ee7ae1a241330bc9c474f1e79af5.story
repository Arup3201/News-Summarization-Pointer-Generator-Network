A former Taliban fighter serving four life sentences for trying to recruit home-grown terrorists to kill British soldiers can keep his family home, a court has ruled.

In a legal first, police tried to confiscate Munir Farooqi's four-bedroom home after he turned the property in Manchester into a 'production centre' for extremist propaganda.

But in a landmark High Court ruling, senior law lord Sir Richard Henriques QC refused to make the order because of the effect it would have on Farooqi's 'wholly innocent' family.

A judge has ruled Munir Farooqi (left) can keep the Manchester home he used to recruit terrorists (right)

The judge found that the family home, which once contained a collection of 50,000 extremist books, DVDs and CDs, cannot be forfeited to pay Farooqi's £400,000 in legal aid costs and £100,000 in prosecution costs.

The case is believed to be the first ever bid to seize the home of a convicted terrorist using new laws under Section 23A of the Terrorism Act 2000.

Farooqi 
had argued that the family home and the two rented properties were not 
owned by him and were in the names of other family members including his
 wife Zeenat and daughter Zulaikha.

His family said it would be unfair to confiscate the their home, which houses three generations.

They
 also said the two other properties are the main source of income and the 
livelihood for the families and confiscation of those would be a 'gross 
injustice'.

Father-of-three Farooqi was at the centre of a plot to radicalise and persuade vulnerable young men to 'fight, kill and die' in a jihad in Afghanistan, his trial in 2011 heard.

The judge ruled Farooqi's family were 'wholly innocent' and should not have to move out

Farooqi was inspired to head to Afghanistan by the allied invasion which followed the 9/11 terror attacks.

He joined the Taliban as an 'active terrorist' but was captured and jailed in November 2001. But by May 2002 he was released by the authorities in Pakistan and headed back to Manchester.

The father-of-three ran a Dawah, Islamic book stall, on Longsight market in Manchester to spread the word of Islam.

Farooqi's operation was 'sophisticated, ruthless and well honed', the judge said, with him dedicating his life to the recruitment of men willing to fight abroad in the name of extremist Islam.

His son, 
Harris, was cleared by the jury in the same trial as his father of a 
single count of engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorism.

But after Farooqi's conviction, his son and other family living at the property fought the authorities' attempts to get a forfeiture order for the house.

Farooqi's family say they cannot live in one of his two other properties, which have been divided into flats and provide them with income

Farooqi owns two other houses in Manchester, which are rented out, with those assets worth £510,000 in all.

But, in 
his ruling today, judge Sir Richard said that the two other houses were 
'unsuitable' to rehouse the family if the main home was forfeited as 
they are divided into flats.

However, the judge did order that Farooqi should be liable for the legal costs of bringing the trial.

Pakistani-born
 British citizen Farooqi, was captured in a police sting when two 
undercover anti-terrorism police officers infiltrated his group wearing 
secret bugging devices.

He had bragged to the officers how he had fought with the Taliban and told them they could become 'martyrs' for the cause.

Under
 Clause 23a of the Terrorism Act 2000 a convicted terrorist can have 
their assets seized by the state under a forfeiture order.

The
 Farooqi family were informed of the Crown Prosecution Service's 
Proceeds of Crime Unit's intention to seize the house at the end of 
Munir Farooqi's trial.

The courts found Farooqi attempted to radicalise men and recruit them for jihad at the house.

But the judge ordered the seizure proceedings to take place after the outcome of Farooqi's appeal.

His outraged family say they are entitled to a private and family life and will use the Human Rights Act to fight the move.

Their
 solicitor Simon Pook said the act had been misinterpreted and would be 
in breach of the European Convention of Human Rights if it created case 
law.

The CPS has said the 
power to forfeit residential premises in these circumstances is a new 
power under the Counter Terrorism Act 2008.

He also found 'amusement' in the sight of the flag-draped coffins of fallen allied troops returning from Afghanistan.

Farooqi 
was given four life sentences and told he must serve a minimum of nine 
years before he can be considered for parole after being convicted of 
preparing for acts of terrorism, three counts of soliciting to murder 
and one count of dissemination of terrorist publications, following a 
four month trial at Manchester Crown Court in 2011.

The forfeiture proceedings had been brought by the North West Counter Terrorism Unit (NWCTU) and the Crown Prosecution Service.

Outside
 court today, Detective Superintendent Julian Richardson said: 'Munir Farooqi 
was convicted and sentenced in 2011 of preparation for terrorist acts 
overseas, three counts of soliciting to murder and dissemination of 
terrorist publications and given four life sentences.

'All of the offences took place at Victoria Terrace, Longsight, Manchester, which is the Farooqi family home.

'The ruling by Sir Richard Henriques demonstrates a proportionate response to the evidence placed before the court.

'The
 Crown agreed that the ruling give due consideration to those 
'interested parties' so that no innocent party was unduly punished or 
made homeless as a result of this hearing.

'The
 £500k costs order should draw to a conclusion this protracted and 
complex investigation into the most serious offences that threatened the
 lives of coalition Forces overseas.

'Munir
 Farooqi threatened to kill 40-50 military personnel when planning his 
attacks. The ruling provides some redress to the state for the 
significant cost to the public purse and hopefully acts as a deterrent 
to those considering terrorist acts.'
