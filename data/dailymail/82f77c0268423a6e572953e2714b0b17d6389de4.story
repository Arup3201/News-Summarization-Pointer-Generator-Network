Ms Riggien, who was born in South Africa and lived in Ireland before moving to Australia in 2006.

Also remembered for her great love of religion, Gary Morton, the senior pastor of Crossroads Church in Maitland, told Daily Mail Australia that Ms Riggien had been an active member and regular attendee for the last 18 months.
