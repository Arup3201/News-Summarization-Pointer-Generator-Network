A radio show host who asked a Canadian politician what it was like to be a sexually-attractive mother has been fired.

JetFM DJ Justin 'Drex' Wilcomes asked British Colombia premier Christy Clark the leading question after it was submitted by a male listener during the on-air interview.

The 47-year-old mother of one seemed surprised by the question, which used the acronmym MILF, a lewd term referencing a mother's sex appeal.

She laughed, and said: 'You know, I take that as a compliment.

'Better a MILF than a cougar, so tell him I said thank you.'

The term cougar is used to mean an older woman who seeks the company of much younger men.

After the interview, which was broadcast last month, Canadian websites and news programmes discussed the appropriateness both of the DJ posing the question, and of the politician's reply.

JetFM, a rock radio station that serves the Comox Valley on Vancouver Island, yesterday said it had released Justin 'Drex' Wilcomes from his employment contract.

'We treat employee matters as private and will not comment further, other than to say that this was an internal decision,' the station said in a statement.

The politician's office said it had neither complained about the DJ's conduct, nor sought his sacking.

The Vancouver Sun reported that Wilcomes had no comment yesterday, but said he told a local radio station that he 'did what was expected of me' as an FM radio station host and called the termination an overreaction.

'I work at a rock station; we do entertainment and comedy,' he said.

'I donâ€™t think it was a bad thing.. ...more the media attention is what they were angry about.'

Miss Clark, who has an 11-year-old son, Hamish, by ex-husband political strategist Mark Marissen, has refused to rise to sexist suggestions that either her job or her family might be compromised by her high status role.

In a television interview conducted just before she was elected as leader of the British Columbia Liberal Party in 2011, she compared her position to that of male Canadian Prime Minister, Seven Harper.

She said: 'Steven Harper manages to go home for dinner with his kids every night, or most nights when he's in the country, and he has breakfast with them in the morning, and he's a pretty busy guy.

'He does a pretty good job.'
