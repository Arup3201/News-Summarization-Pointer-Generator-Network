A pair of juveniles have been charged in connection with a fire that caused millions of dollars damage at a South Carolina Walmart store on New Year’s Eve.

An 11-year-old boy has been charged with third-degree arson and shoplifting while his 13-year-old cousin is charged with third-degree arson, according to the Columbia Police Department.

Police say the 11-year-old is accused of stealing a lighter from the Walmart store in Columbia on Dec. 31 and intentionally setting a fire in the greeting card aisle.

Columbia firefighters evacuated the store as a precaution and contained the fire to the source area, according to  investigators who responded to the scene.

No injuries were reported.

In an effort to identify suspects, police on Thursday released Walmart surveillance images including a photo showing the boy and girl entering the store, reports The Smoking Gun.

The parents of the respective suspects turned the minors in to police late on Friday afternoon.

The children were then charged and subsequently released into their parents’s custody.

The fire forced Walmart to close temporarily for repairs, but the store has since reopened.

Police had also released footage of an adult male and a vehicle that they believed may have been linked to the arson attack. It isn’t known if they were linked to the juveniles. 

The car was described as a possibly white, older model Chevy Tahoe or GMC Yukon.

Police had also released footage of an adult male pictured entering the store around the same time as the two children - it isn't known if he is still involved in the investigation 

Footage of this car - described as a possibly white, older model Chevy Tahoe or GMC Yukon - was also released by police investigating the crime
