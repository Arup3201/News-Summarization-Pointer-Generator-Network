French women are covering up in unprecedented numbers, with just one in fifty now willing to go topless on the beach - and France's free-falling economy could be to blame.

According to a poll by the French edition of Elle magazine this summer, just two per cent of women surveyed are now happy to shed their bikini tops when sunbathing.

And according to one sociologist, a general air of low confidence in the country thanks to its consistently poor economic performance could be behind the cultural shift.

Jean-Clade Kauffman, the author of a book on female nudity, said the French are newly averse to 'risk and revolution' thanks to austerity measures causing unrest in the country.

She said: 'France has also been hard hit by austerity since the start of the financial crisis.

'If breast-baring is a sign of risk and revolution, covering up is a sign of safety. In uncertain times, you always dress more conservatively.'

The survey shows a dramatic change of attitude in France, which used to be a haven of toplessness, even when it was taboo across most of the world in the 1960s.

Actress Brigette Bardot, who appeared in sexually-charged films of the era and was photographed holidaying topless in the Riviera.

But now women are far more hesitant, from Brest to Bordeaux, according to the magazine survey.

Muriel Trazie, 60, sunbathes in Paris often, and said: 'It's seen as vulgar. People are more prudish these days.'

Meanwhile Sandra Riahi, 22, in a bikini, chimed in: 'I've never done it. I'd be too embarrassed.' 

Kaufmann also suggested the decline was because today's women have forgotten the freedoms won by feminists in decades past.

She said: 'French young women today are more conformist. They've already attained freedom ... So they've gotten lazy and taken it for granted.'

In one Parisian park, local authorities have gone so far to erect signs reminding women in the area to remember their bikini tops. 

Social media has also been mooted as a culprit. Nathan Assouline, a 22-year-old beach monitor at Paris Plages, an artificial beach in the capital, said some sunbathers could be discouraged by the rise of phone cameras.

He said: 'I see lots of old men loitering around here,' he said. 'I have to stop them from taking photos on their phones. It happens all the time.'
