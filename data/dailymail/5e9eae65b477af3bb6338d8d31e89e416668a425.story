The eerie remains of a Japanese warship that lay undiscovered on the ocean floor for more than 70 years have been captured on film.

Musashi was attacked by the US Navy in 1944 and went down with more than 1,000 members of crew on board. 

Despite numerous witness accounts its exact location remained a mystery for decades.  

But the ship was discovered earlier this month after Microsoft's billionaire co-founder Paul Allen spent eight years searching for it with his personal submarine.

The remains of a Japanese warship that sunk more than 70 years ago have been captured on film for the first time

Allen has now released footage showing the huge warship, which was the heaviest and most powerfully armed battleship ever constructed, on the floor of the Sibuyan Sea - nearly two miles under the surface. 

He is hoping the discovery  'brings closure' to those who lost relatives aboard the ship, according to his website. 

His yacht, the M/Y Octopus, has a remote operated probe Octo ROV that initially located the Musashi at the beginning of March. The Octopus is also outfitted with an exploration submarine.

Allen and his research team used the historical records of four different countries in order to pinpoint the location of the ship.

After discovering it Allen posted a photo of a valve from the wreckage, which he described as the 'first confirmation' that it was of Japanese origin.

He wrote in a tweet: 'RIP (rest in peace) crew of Musashi, approximately 1,023 (lives) lost.'

He promised that  he would soon post video of the ship's catapult and valve areas.

The Sibuyan Sea - at the heart of the Philippines' central Visayas islands - now covers busy shipping lanes and lies on the path of most tropical storms that cross the country from the Pacific Ocean.

But in 1944, it was the scene for a battle considered the largest naval encounter of the Second World War - a battle which would be the Musashi's last. 

Paul Allen, one of Microsoft's co-founders, was able to find the ship using his private yacht and sub the M/Y Octopus. Above, one of the ship's 15 tonne anchors

The Musashi was the Japanese Navy's biggest battleship during the Second World War

The battleship, which weighed 73,000 tonnes fully loaded, and was armed with nine 45 Caliber Type 94 main guns, was sunk by American warplanes on October 24, 1944. 

It was the height of the Battle of Leyte Gulf - in which US and Australian forces defeated the Japanese. 

About half the crew died when it went down. 

Sister ship the Yamato was damaged in the fighting, according to the US Navy, and American warships finally sank it a year later as it attempted to reach Okinawa.

Mr Allen took to Twitter to reveal he had found the wreck of the Musashi, sunk in 1944

For Seattle-born Allen, 62, who founded Microsoft with Bill Gates in 1975, the discovery of the Musashi is a thrilling moment.

'Since my youth, I have been fascinated with World War II history, inspired by my father’s service in the U.S. Army,'  Allen said. 

'The Musashi is truly an engineering marvel and, as an engineer at heart, I have a deep appreciation for the technology and effort that went into its construction. 

'I am honoured to play a part in finding this key vessel in naval history and honouring the memory of the incredible bravery of the men who served aboard her.'

Allen, the 51st richest person in the world with a net worth of $17.5billion, according to Forbes Magazine, is known for his love of history - and also his generosity with the Octopus to help other exploration missions.

In 2012, Allen loaned the same ship that located the Musashi to the British government to locate HMS Hood bell from the bottom of the Denmark Strait. 

The search was eventually called off due to bad weather.  

The Octopus has also collaborated on Google Earth’s 'Explore the Ocean' feature, and has helped the Discovery Science Channel capture footage for a documentary to study the effects of nuclear detonation on the marine environment.

Director James Cameron has also used it, for a seven-hour solo journey to the earth's deepest point back in 2012.

But Allen is not confined to undersea exploration, either.

The American is also working on a project called Stratolaunch, which aims to put 'cost-effective' cargo and manned missions into space.

He launched SpaceShipOne, the first privately built craft into suborbital space in 2004. 

Spokespersons for the Philippines' navy and coast guard told AFP they were not informed of the discovery.

For four days in October 1944, the seas around the island of Leyte bore witness to what some believe is the biggest battle in naval history.

The Battle of Leyte Gulf, formerly known as the Second Battle of the Philippine Sea, began on October 23, pitting the combined force of the U.S. and Australian forces against the Imperial Japanese Navy.

Three days earlier, the Americans had launched an attack on Leyte; the Japanese responded with Sho-Go - an operation designed to lure U.S. forces away from the San Bernardino Strait.

But the Japanese navy was attacked by U.S. submarines as it moved into position on October 23 - the first of four major encounters over the battle.

The Musashi survived this first encounter, but the next day, as it passed through the Sibuyan Sea, came under bombardment from the U.S. warplanes.

It was first hit at 10.30am, and then again in a second wave.

However, the ship did not finally disappear under the waves until 7.30pm that evening. It had been struck by at least 17 bombs and 19 torpedoes during the battle.

By October 26 - the end of the battle - the Japanese lost 26 battleships, but only sank six of the U.S.'s ships.

The Japanese had also suffered huge numbers of casualties: more than 10,000 men are believed to have died. The Allied Forces, on the other hand, lost around 1,500.
