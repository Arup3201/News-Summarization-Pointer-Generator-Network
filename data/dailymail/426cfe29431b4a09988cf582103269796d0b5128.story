A Labour donor and close friend of Tony Blair paid almost £40million in bribes to secure business contracts worth billions, a court was told.

Victor Dahdaleh, 70, is accused of passing money to a member of the Bahraini royal family in exchange for huge aluminium contracts.

The Jordanian-born metals magnate allegedly issued orders for the payments using a fax machine at his home in Belgravia, Central London.

Dahdaleh is also accused of paying the company's chief executive Bruce Hall around £3million in bribes until he left the business in 2005

One of the alleged recipients was 
Sheikh Isa Bin Ali Al Khalifa, the minister of oil and industry and 
chairman of state-owned Aluminium Bahrain BSC (Alba).

Another was Alba chief executive Bruce Hall, 61, who received £3million in kickbacks which he spent on luxury property.

Prosecutor
Philip Shears QC said the bribes were paid over eight years up to 2006 
to win business for companies in which Dahdaleh had an interest.

He told Southwark Crown Court: ‘Corruption on any scale, particularly such as this, destroys the fair market place.’

Dahdaleh
has been close to Labour for years, pouring money into party causes and
enjoying a warm friendship with Mr Blair and Lord Mandelson.

Opening the case at Southwark Crown Court, prosecutor Philip Shears QC said: 'This case is about corruption. It is corruption, we suggest, on a very large scale.

'In a nutshell our case is that over the course of about eight years between 1998 and 2006 this defendant, Victor Dahdaleh, made corrupt payments totalling the Sterling equivalent of about £40million to the chairman Sheikh Isa Bin Ali Al Khalifa and the Chief Executive Officer Bruce Hall, of one of Bahrain's largest companies, Aluminium Bahrain BSC (Alba).

'These payments, we say, were corruptly made in order to win business for companies who hoped to trade with Alba.

'During that period Mr Dahdaleh was engaged in negotiations with contracts made between Alba and companies in which he had an interest in respect of the products and components associated with the production of aluminium.

'You will hear that many of the instructions to banks to make corrupt payments were made by Mr Dahdaleh in London, using a fax machine which clearly bears his details, so most of the fraud was carried out here.'

He added: 'It is clear there was no legitimate purpose for such payments to be made by Mr Dahdaleh.

'Corruption on any scale, particularly on this scale, is such that it destroys the fair marketplace.

'Companies who are prepared to engage in such unlawful conduct get an unfair advantage over competitors and prevent honest and hard working companies from conducting business on an equal footing.'

The trial is is expected to continue into next year at Southwark Crown Court. The businessman denies all charges

The court heard Alba accounts for 10 per cent of Bahrain's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and nearly 70 per cent of its non-oil exports. Its shares are three quarters owned by the Bahraini government.

As chairman Sheikh had a 'significant influence' over contracts awarded by Alba, it was said.

But as the UK has no extradition treaty with Bahrain the Sheikh could not be made to stand trial here, jurors were told.

Mr Shears said the payments were largely made or received through companies controlled by Dahdaleh and the Sheikh.

'It is pursuant to a criminal conspiracy,' he added.

Dahdaleh, has dual Canadian and British citizenship and lives in Belgravia, central London, was questioned about the payments by the Serious Fraud Office in 2010 but made no comment.

He later claimed the money transfers were made in respect of sponsorship payments to the Bahraini government.

But the prosecutor said there was no such practice in Bahrain and such acts 'were not only unheard of but unlawful.'

Dahdaleh, who has hearing problems and was allowed to sit outside the dock, denies six counts of corruption, one of conspiracy to corrupt and one of transferring criminal property.

The case, which is expected to go into next year, continues.
