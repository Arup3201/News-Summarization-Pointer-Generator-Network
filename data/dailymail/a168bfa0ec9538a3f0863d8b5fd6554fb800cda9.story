Burned: Phillip Lechter says his new iPhone 6 bent and burst into flames earlier this month, while he was attending a football game at the University of Arizona

Yet another iPhone defect has been revealed from a man in Arizona who reports that he suffered serious burns when his phone burst to flames in his pocket.

Arizona business coach Phillip Lechter says the incident happened on October 11, while his family was visiting the University of Arizona to watch a football game against USC.

On his personal blog, Mr Lechter writes that he was riding to a tailgate party in a rickshaw with his wife and 7-year-old son, when the cart tipped over.

Mr Lechter says he was checking to see if his wife and child were ok when he 'felt a burning sensation on my leg and smelled smoke from my pants'.

'I surveyed the rickshaw quickly and could not find anything that could have set me on fire. Then it hit me, my phone was in my pocket.

'Somehow in the process of the tipping of the rickshaw my new APPLE iPhone 6 had bent in my front pocket and caught on fire.

Mr Lechter says the smoke was thick, and he could even see flames burning through his pocket and boxers. 

'The smell was disturbing. I could feel my leg burning. I pulled the Apple iPhone 6 out of my pocket and threw it to the side,' Mr Lechter said, adding that in the process he incurred more burns to his hip.

Broken: He says his phone then burst into flames, searing a hole through is pocket and boxers to burns his thigh 

But he says the leather phone case saved him from even more pain to his hand.

'A bystander was not so lucky; he picked up the phone without the case and burned his fingers.

Someone from the crowd then put out the flames by pouring a cup of water on the phone.

Mr Lechter went to the hospital after the incident where a doctor treated him for an approximately 4-square-inch second degree burn to his right leg.

Though Apple has replaced the phone for Mr Lechter, he wants them to go another step further and pay his medical bills.

Shortly after the latest iPhone's release, critics started reporting various issues with the device including how it could be bent. Users also started complaining about hair getting caught in the seam between the glass and aluminum exterior.

Apple did not return MailOnline's calls for comment Thursday morning.
