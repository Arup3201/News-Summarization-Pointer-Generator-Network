AFL star Lance 'Buddy' Franklin is set to cement the rest of his playing days in Sydney as he prepares to sell the keys to his $1.7 million Melbourne home  next month.

The Sydney Swans's star recruit ended his nine-year association with Hawthorn last year when he penned a near $1 million-a-year deal to play for Sydney on a nine-year contract.

Now less than a year after leaving Hawthorn the star full forward is about to bury his old life back in Melbourne when he puts his East Brighton home, in the city's south, up for auction next month.

The home is listed with East Brighton's Nick Johnstone Real Estate  for between $1.6 and $1.7 million

Franklin, who lives in Bondi in Sydney's east with girlfriend Jesinta Campbell, has been the driving force behind Sydney's premiership bid this year and polled just four votes shy of a maiden Brownlow Medal at Monday's premier AFL event.

Having already claimed the Coleman Medal and All-Australian selection, Franklin was one of several favourites to win AFL's top prize. 

At 27, Franklin has played in three grand final appearances and will line up in his fourth on Saturday against his old club  Hawthorn.

On his decision to sell his Melbourne base Nick Johnstone, of Brighton's Nick Johnstone Real Estate, said Franklin's property at 55 Hodder Street East Brighton would probably sell for the same  price he paid to acquire it four years ago.

It is being quoted at between $1.6 million to $1.7 million. In 2010 the star bought the newly built home for $1.635 million.

Mr Johnstone said the property was 'a substantial four-bedroom home with a pool and a theatre room'.

At the time, the property was advertised at between $1.45 million to $1.55 million but Franklin paid a little extra for the keys.

Mr Johnstone said the property was 'a substantial four-bedroom home with a pool and a theatre room'. 

Franklin's luxury home is decked out with three generous living zones, four bedrooms and resort-style indoor/outdoor living centred around a pool. 

It even has its own cinema and a gourmet kitchen with butler's pantry. 

Mr Johnstone said Franklin originally lived in the house but turned it into a rental property at the end of 2013, when he signed with the Swans and relocated to Sydney.

'He has signed a nine-year contract with the Swans and he's living in Sydney now,' Mr Johnstone said.

Born in Perth, Franklin was picked by Hawthorn as the No.5 draft in the 2004 national draft.

He played in the 2013 AFL grand final, in which Hawthorn defeated Fremantle, and in Hawthorn's 2008 premiership-winning side against Geelong.

Franklin's  move to Sydney was reportedly signed and sealed well before the 2013 grand final win - but was only made public days after. 

The full-forward expressed his desire to move to Sydney and a deal was stitched up and kept tight lipped during Hawthorn's premiership campaign.

The club kept the deal under wraps for fear that if it was leaked it might disrupt the club's preparations for the flag.

On Monday his loyal girlfriend of one year, model Jesinta, was by his side to attend the special Sydney Swans Brownlow awards held in Sydney.

The Swans held their own Sydney-based ceremony so that the players could continue to train ahead of the Saturday's grand final.

As part of a live cross from the main event, Franklin spoke about Saturday's upcoming match against his former team - the Hawks.

'I found myself up against the Hawks on Saturday, I'm really looking forward to the challenge,' he said.
