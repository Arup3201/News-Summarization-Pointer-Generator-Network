Support for the UK Independence Party has dropped sharply in the wake of its surprise local elections success.

A new opinion poll today showed 12 per cent of people said they were backing Nigel Farage’s party, down from an 18 per cent spike last month.

It suggests the party’s popularity is closely aligned to the media exposure it received in the run-up to council elections which saw it gain 139 seats.

Dip: There has been a sharp drop in support for UKIP since the record peak of 18 per cent in May

The surge in support for the anti-EU party spooked the Tory party and forced David Cameron to rush forward plans to try to legislate to hold an in-out referendum on Britain’s relationship with Brussels.

Today the Tory party launched an online campaign to get voters to pile pressure on Lib Dem and Labour MPs to back a backbench Bill which would guarantee a referendum before 2017.

In the latest ICM/Guardian poll, support for Labour stood at 36 per cent, up two points on May.

The Tories were up one point on 29 per cent and the Lib Dems up one on 12 per cent, suggesting all the main parties have gained from a six point drop in support for UKIP.

It means Mr Farage’s party is still neck and neck with Nick Clegg’s Lib Dems, who have seen their support slump since joining the coalition.

Tory rebel MP Andrew Bridgen accused Mr Cameron of pursuing policies which boost UKIP's support.

'By pressing ahead with gay marriage and delaying a promise on an EU referendum until he was forced to do so, Mr Cameron has fuelled the rise of UKIP,' he said at the weekend.

'We have created our own nemesis.'

However voters still rate Mr Cameron and George Osborne more highly than Labour to run the economy, the poll found.

When voters were asked to put aside party preference and concentrate on who could manage the economy properly, 35 per cent named the Prime Minister and Chancellor, while only 24 per cent chose Ed Miliband and Ed Balls.

Less than half of those questioned said they believed Mr Cameron had the backing of his party following months of infighting, compared to 62 per cent at the end of last year.

The Guardian said that ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1,002 adults by phone between June 7 and 9.
