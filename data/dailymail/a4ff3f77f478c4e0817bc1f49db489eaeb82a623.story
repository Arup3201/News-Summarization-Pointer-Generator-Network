Vietnamese Quoc Ta, 33, (pictured) had been deported from the UK twice before he was arrested  at Derby train station carrying £4,500 of cannabis

An illegal immigrant who had twice been deported from Britain was caught with 2.2lb of cannabis on a train - after sneaking back into the UK for a third time.

Quoc Ta was jailed for eight months after a court heard how transport police officers boarded a carriage and noticed an overwhelming stench of cannabis.

Local councillors yesterday said the case proves that Britain remains an ‘easy touch’ for foreign criminals despite Border Force attempts to claim down on the influx of offenders from abroad.

Ta, from Vietnam, now faces being deported for a third time once he is released from prison after being caught with cannabis with a street value of up to £4,500 while sitting alone on the train at Derby station.

The 33-year-old admitted possessing the class B drug with intent to supply.

Ta first came to the attention of UK authorities in 2008 when he was arrested in connection with a burglary. He was not convicted but was deported to Vietnam.

He was arrested in April 2012 after being recruited as a ‘gardener’ growing cannabis for a south-east Asian gang and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. On his release he was deported in December 2012.

Derby Crown Court was not told how Ta made it back into the country for a third time, but prosecutor Karen Davenport-Coles said he was arrested in January when British Transport Police went on to the train where there was an ‘extremely strong smell of cannabis’.

Laura Chaplin, defending, said, told the court on Monday that Ta, of Leeds, returned to the UK for a third time having been ‘the victim of a very serious assault in Vietnam, through owing money.’ She said a knife had been used in the attack and threats had been made against his family.

Miss Chaplin said Ta had agreed to transport the cannabis for payment after finding himself ‘in a very desperate situation.’ Following the hearing, Councillor Alan Graves, leader of Derby’s UKIP group said: ‘Clearly, he’s not the sort of person we want in this country. I would imagine once he got into an EU country, he found it very easy to get back into this country.

 ‘He obviously wants to come to this country because we are an easy touch.’ Fellow councillor Lucy Care, deputy leader of Derby’s Liberal Democrats, said: ‘It doesn’t seem right to me that somebody that we’ve sent out of the country because he is not following our laws is able to get back in again so soon afterwards. It makes a mockery of having gone to the effort to get rid of him.’

A Home Office spokesman said all passengers entering the UK were ‘checked against police, security and immigration watch lists on arrival.’ He added: ‘Where we believe someone poses a risk, Border Force officers can - and do - refuse them entry.

‘Border Force officers use an array of search techniques including sniffer dogs, carbon dioxide detectors, heartbeat monitors, scanners and visual searches to find well-hidden stowaways on vehicles.

‘Those subject to deportation orders face an indefinite ban from returning to the UK. They are entitled to apply to have the ban lifted after 10 years.’

Last August, a court heard how a Lithuanian burglar who was deported upon early release from prison was caught back in the UK just 12 days later.

Police suspected Marius Siurkus, 32, returned to Peterborough to retrieve jewellery he had stolen during the burglary and hidden under floorboards.

Incredibly, Siurkus’s accomplice in the burglary, countryman Mantas Pronckus, had also twice previously been freed from prison early and deported - only to return to the UK and continue offending on each occasion.

The same month, 14-year-old Alice Gross disappeared after going for a walk along a canal near her home in Brentford, west London. The teenager’s body was later recovered from the River Brent.

The badly decomposed body of the prime suspect in the murder, Arnis Zalkalns, 41, was found in a park one mile away in October, after it had been revealed the Latvian had been allowed into the UK despite being convicted of murder in his homeland.

Foreign criminals make up about one in eight - or 11,000 - of all those behind bars in England and Wales.
