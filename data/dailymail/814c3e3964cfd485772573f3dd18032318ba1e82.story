Gareth Southgate believes Raheem Sterling's busy schedule should exclude him from England Under 21 duty, but suggested Luke Shaw could do with the game time.

The former Middlesbrough manager highlighted that, despite still being eligible, Sterling's participation in the Premier League, Champions League and senior national side meant he was unlikely to benefit from playing for the Young Lions.

'Whilst as a coach you always want the best possible players available, sometimes I don't think it is the right or appropriate challenge for the individual player,' the England Under 21s boss said.

Raheem Sterling has become a regular with both England and Liverpool, for whom he also plays in Europe

Luke Shaw is in the England Under 21 squad, though, as he bids to regain his form and fitness

'Raheem is one who I don't say is finished at this level but, clearly, having played in the World Cup, he's now made himself pretty much a first-choice for the senior team.

'What would we get back in terms of his feelings and his mood? He is a great professional, I have to say, so I am sure he would react to it in the right way because he did when he came back with us last year. His training was fantastic.

'But are you going to get exactly the same performance? He has got England seniors, he has got Liverpool with the league, he has got Liverpool with the Champions League.

'On the list of priorities, the 21s wouldn't necessarily be so high. For the group, you think you're bringing back the best players but it wouldn't necessarily guarantee you get a better performance whereas the boys with us this week, for them this is everything.

Gareth Southgate said he wants the best players for his Under 21 side but has to consider all factors

Spouthgate said he did not doubt Sterling's attitude but felt it would not benefit him to join the Under 21s

'So we win both ways, really. We give Raheem the experience of continuing with the seniors and we also get the experience for the group that remains with us.'

While Sterling was included in the senior squad for the Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia, defenders Calum Chambers and Shaw dropped into the Under 21s.

The former was bumped back up after an injury to John Stones, although Manchester United left-back Shaw remains with the Under 21s.

It was not a decision Southgate took lightly but, like Sterling, believes the decision is for the betterment of the individual and country.

'Leighton Baines did really well last month, so would Luke start for the seniors this time around? What's the best experience for him?' he said.

Louis van Gaal is a strong advocate of the international Under 21 level of football, and explained that to Shaw

Calum Chambers was initially in the Under 21 squad, but was promoted after the injury to John Stones

'I think certainly from his club perspective playing two matches would be good because he has not had a lot of football.

'I know Louis van Gaal was very positive to him about it. Also, having been manager of a national team and spoken so much about the importance of the Under 21s in preparation for the Dutch last summer, I didn't think we were going to have an issue from the club.'

Southgate admitted that he had considered whether Shaw's meteoric rise would affect his motivation, but has faith the former Southampton man is in the right frame of mind.

He said: 'You're thinking, "where's the player with it," because his world has changed a lot since we had him last November.

'He has played as many matches this campaign as our other left-backs, but his world has changed considerably.

Southgate said Roy Hodgson had spoken to Shaw about playing for the Under 21 side

Stuart Pearce was Southgate's predecessor as Under 21 manager, but was sacked last summer

'But he has been brilliant. Roy spoke to him, which I think was important, I then spoke to him before we met up and a really good chat since we got here.

'He is looking forward to the game. Yes, he played at the World Cup, he has played friendlies for the seniors, but he has only got three caps for us.

'So although he is making brilliant progress in his career, he is not the finished article so experiences like this can only help him.'

Having won their European Championships qualifying group at a canter, the unbeaten Young Lions now face a two-legged clash with Croatia as they look to progress to next summer's finals in the Czech Republic.

They prepare for that tournament in the shadow of a miserable performance at last years's edition in Israel, where the Under 21s returned home embarrassed after losing all three games.

It led to manager Stuart Pearce losing his job, with the former Under 21s boss this week saying successor Southgate should get the pick of the talent to avoid similar failure this time around.

Goalkeepers: Jonathan Bond (Watford), Jack Butland (Stoke City), Sam Johnstone (Manchester United).

Defenders:  Eric Dier (Tottenham Hotspur), Luke Garbutt (Everton), Ben Gibson (Middlesbrough), Carl Jenkinson (West Ham United, on loan from Arsenal), Michael Keane (Burnley, on loan from Manchester United), Jamaal Lascelles (Nottingham Forest, on loan from Newcastle United), Liam Moore (Leicester City), Luke Shaw (Manchester United).

Midfielders: Lewis Baker (Chelsea), Tom Carroll (Swansea City, on loan from Tottenham Hotspur), Jake Forster-Caskey (Brighton & Hove Albion), Will Hughes (Derby County), Thomas Ince (Hull City), Alex Pritchard (Brentford, on loan from Tottenham Hotspur), Nathan Redmond (Norwich City).

Forwards: Patrick Bamford (Middlesbrough, on loan from Chelsea), Saido Berahino (West Bromwich Albion), Harry Kane (Tottenham Hotspur), Cauley Woodrow (Fulham).
