This is the moment a weatherman gets an unexpected surprise on live TV as an excitable dog jumps up to greet him mid-forecast.

Ryan Phillips, a meteorologist for NBC 6 South Florida, was giving a post-Thanksgiving summary on Friday when suddenly a large pooch jumped up on the desk in front of him and rolled around.

The one-year-old American bulldog named King was meant to be waiting in the sidelines for the 'Pet of the Week' segment, but had somehow managed to escape.

'Hey King. How are you? Whoo! Live TV,' a shocked Phillips says, as he strokes the animal.

Recovering his composure, he adds: 'Alright, let's just go to the map so we can get him off of here in a graceful fashion. '

The segment then cuts to a screen of text showing the weather headlines. King can be heard whimpering in the background as he's escorted back to his kennel.

Phillips then reappears on-screen without his four-legged friend. He jokes that King was probably attracted to him because he's got some steak treats hidden in his jacket pocket.

The pup is currently up for adoption and temporarily living at the Pooches In Pines animal shelter in Florida. Since, his television debut, the applications have no doubt been flooding in.

'King is adorable! Hope he gets his forever home really soon!' one viewer mused after watching him in action.
