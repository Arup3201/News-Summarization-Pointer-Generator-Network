Councils who ‘cheat’ the system to force up council tax bills without the backing of local people are to be punished by the government.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles warned town halls they must ‘be straight with people’ and not use loopholes to avoid holding local referendums on rises of more than two per cent.

Just a third of councils - 115 from 351 - have so far agreed to a freeze in bills, compared to 99 per cent in 2011 and 85 per cent last year.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles accused councils who try to avoid holding a referendum on rises in council tax of being 'democracy dodgers'

Mr Pickles attacked ‘democracy dodgers’ planning to impose rises of 1.99 per cent without seeking permission from local residents.

He said he wanted council tax to be frozen, without cuts to services like bin collections or filling potholes.

But many council leaders warns that after two years of cuts in funding from Whitehall they are unable to sustain services without increasing council tax bills.

Mr Pickles insisted that authorities who sanction big rises in bills had to explain it to local people.

The BBC has come under fire for the way it reports the government's austerity programme.

Eric Pickles said the 'wasteful' corporation needed to curb its own spending and rethink the language it uses to describe public spending reductions. 

'You would think listening to the BBC that sensible savings and improved services were a bad thing,' the Communities Secretary wrote in the Daily Telegraph.

'To them every saving is a cut. It’s high time the BBC curbed some of her wasteful ways and became more transparent with our cash.'

Downing Street refused to say if David Cameron agreed with Mr Pickles.

'How broadcasters report is a matter for them,' the Prime Minister's official spokesman said.

'What the Prime Minister is doing is getting on with making the case for the government's economic policy.

‘I don’t have a problem with councils that want to put up council tax if they have a good reason – to fund local opportunities,’ he said in an article for the Daily Telegraph.

‘But I do have an issue if they don’t ask permission first. They have to man up. Be straight with people. Take them into their confidence.

'If the public believes you’ve got a sensible case they might well listen. But councils should also stop treating residents with contempt.’

The threshold for triggering a referendum on council tax rises has been lowered to two per cent.

‘Democracy dodgers who try creep in under the radar, putting up their stealth tax by 1.99 per cent in a bid to avoid our 2 percent referendum threshold, need a reality check,’ Mr Pickles said. ‘We will take into consideration anybody cheating their taxpayers. Anybody using loopholes will lose out next year.’

Local authorities had to cut waste, innovate and focus on ‘putting people first’, Mr Pickles add.

‘What residents really want is cuts to taxes not bin collections; potholes filled not pockets. Councils that put their people first, will get the idea. To those that don’t we’re sending out a message loud and clear.

‘The days of the knee jerk tax and spend hike are over. And there is a clear dividing line here. We want to freeze council tax and save on average families 72 pounds a year on a band d property. Labour scoff at this and brand it a gimmick. It just shows how out of touch they are.’

However Sir Merrick Cockell, chairman of the Local Government Association (LGA), said: 'Councils have the skills, confidence and ambition to lead our communities, but to see the true benefits of local decision-making, particularly around creating the right environment for stimulating economic growth, we need the freedom to make independent decisions about local issues.

'England is one of the most centralised democracies in the world. Even within our own Union, locally-elected representatives in England have less power to make decisions on behalf of their communities than those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

'It is time for Government to let go of the reins and give councils the independence to meet the needs of their communities and offer genuine local accountability.'
