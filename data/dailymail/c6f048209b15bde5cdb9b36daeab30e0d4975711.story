‘I congratulate Wayne like I did Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole. Four players have now played 100 times for England under my watch.

‘He also has passion. He could have walked away and he didn’t, he took the criticism, then came back stronger than ever.'

Hodgson added: ‘He has energy - two qualities that meant a lot to me are enthusiasm and energy.

‘He is right up there with the very best. He has skill and he scores goals, he also scores important goals as he did last month against Estonia.'
