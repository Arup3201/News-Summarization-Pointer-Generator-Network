Affecting more than eight out of 10 women, cellulite is considered one of the curses of our gender ... but the next weapon in the quest to banish orange-peel thighs has arrived.

A pioneering invasive cosmetic treatment which targets the dreaded appearance of quilted, pitted fat has hit the market causing a media storm.

Cellulite occurs when the strands that connect the
 layers of tissue and the fat below the skin (fibrous septae) gradually harden and 
contract, while the fat between stays the same and protrudes out in a lumpy fashion.

Diet, exercise, creams and massage could help, but rarely manages to permanently shift cellulite

Diet, exercise, creams and massage do help, but chronic sufferers are constantly on the look out for a long-term solution.

The Sunday Times Style magazine has repotred that new laser cellulite treatment Cellulaze claims to melt the fat and then break down the fibres anchoring the tiny fat pockets, thus banishing the appearance of cellulite.

It is the first scientifically validated laser cellulite treatment to win the approval of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which accepted the results of Cellulaze's year-long trial last January.

The study was conducted in the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and monitored a group of women with an average age of 47.

It showed that just one Cellulaze 
treatment prevented the return of cellulite for at least a year. There 
are even claims that the earliest patients have remained cellulite-free 
for three years.

The treatment, which costs upwards of £2,500, takes one to two hours and involves a local anaesthetic and mild sedation, followed by the insertion of a laser rod, like a fine knitting needle, just below the surface of the skin through a series of tiny cuts, reported the Sunday Times.

Women in the UK spend a staggering £56 million a year on anti-cellulite products

Laser beams then transmit energy 
sideways from the rod to smooth out lumpy fat cells and heat dermal 
tissue. The method promotes skin thickening and tightening, resulting in
 tighter, smoother skin. The laser directly targets the structure of 
cellulite.

As well as destroying the lumps, it stimulates collagen production just below the surface, and, in most cases, gives a smoother result than anything previously achieved by other anticellulite treatments.

The Cellulaze laser fiber claims to level 
out bumps of fat, treat dimples by releasing the fibrous bands that 
pull down on the skin, and stimulate collagen production to increase skin’s
 depth and elasticity for a smoother look.

Liquefied fat is then pressed out.

Hassan Shaaban, a consultant plastic 
surgeon at the Sthetix clinic in Liverpool, was the British pioneer, and
 has now become the principal specialist training other doctors from 
across Europe in the technique.

He
 warns that not every patient will benefit. 'We classify cellulite 
severity from one to four,' he says. 'This treatment works best on 
stages two and three. In other words, women with serious cellulite will 
first have to lose fat by other methods.'

Wraps and massages can only go so far

The physician will mark the areas of cellulite to be treated with a marker

A couple of small incisions will be made, about the size of the tip of a pen

Local anesthesia or numbing solution is used (you'd be awake during the procedure)

The Cellulaze laser fiber is threaded through a very small tube and inserted through the incision

Treatment involves a local anaesthetic and mild sedation, followed by the insertion of a laser rod

The cosmetic surgeon Angelica Kavouni, of the Cadogan Clinic in London, underwent the training last December and has already treated 15 women.

'I am cautiously optimistic that it works, but I think most patients will also have to make lifestyle changes such as diet and more exercise to maintain the results,' she told the Sunday Times.

If you’re prepared to go down the invasive route to reduce those lumps and bumps - and you don't mind investing £2,500 for a year of silky smooth thighs - then this laser-powered treatment may be worth a go.
