A female care home manager faces being struck off after boasting about ‘unspeakable’ sadomasochistic sex acts to colleagues and flashing her breasts at pensioners.

Lesley Weir also showed colleagues marks on her breasts, buttocks and upper thighs and bent a colleague over a desk to spank him, a hearing was told.

A conduct and competence committee found all but one allegation against the Bupa employee was proved. She was cleared of asking a colleague ‘is she dead yet?’, about a cancer patient.

The Nursing and Midwifery Council must now decide whether her actions while manager between February 2008 and August 2010 at Amerind Grove home in Ashton, Bristol, amounted to misconduct and whether her fitness to practise is impaired.

A former colleague told the hearing: ‘On one occasion, she told me about being abused over a car bonnet in a car park.

‘This was what she wanted to happen. She talked of a number of sexual partners and involved BDSM [Bondage, Discipline, Sadism, Masochism], sadomasochistic sex, where Lesley was the slave and her partner was the master. 

‘She showed us bruises she got from her sexual activity and was quite open when sat in the reception area.’

The workmate, who has been granted anonymity by the hearing, said he was scared to report Weir for fear she would lose her temper.

He also told how Weir had spanked him on two separate occasions, including in her office.

Another former colleague said Weir had proudly showed off bruises on her buttocks and breasts, and talked of the ‘unspeakable things’ she liked having done to her.

The hearing also heard how Weir had 
lifted her skirt to flash a couple of pensioners as they visited a 
friend admitted at the home.

Terry Lewis, 76, said he had complained underwear belonging to their friend, a 93-year-old dementia sufferer, had gone missing, to which Weir retorted that he should be ‘on knicker inspection’.

She then told the man he could inspect her underwear first ‘because I’m not wearing any’ before lifting her skirt.

The nurse was sacked from the home after bosses discovered that she had pocketed £900 of rent paid by a nurse who lived in a flat above the home. 

Weir stuffed the envelopes of cash into her diary instead of passing them to the home’s accountant and handed the money back when she was discovered in August 2010 claiming she always intended to pay it back. 

Weir, who is not attending the central London hearing, wrote to the NMC admitting the majority of charges, but denied flashing her buttocks or asking if the patient was ‘dead yet’.

If the panel find that her fitness to practise is impaired, she could be struck off the nursing register.

Mark Elliott, regional director, Bupa care homes said: 'Even though no residents were involved, Lesley Weir’s actions were deplorable for someone in a position of such responsibility.

'We dismissed her in 2010 and referred her to the NMC.'

The hearing continues.
