Squeezed into a four-bedroom council house in Guernsey lives a woman branded the UK's most prolific single mother.

Joanne Watson, 40, has 14 children, ranging in age from three to 22 and
 survives largely on state benefits after the breakdown of her marriage 
in 2010.

Once 
celebrated in endless articles in the press for her clan of immaculately
 turned-out blonde children, who were then supported entirely by the 
salary of her hardworking husband John, Joanne Watson and her family 
have now become figures of ridicule - and even hate.

Mum of Britain's biggest family Joanne Watson, 40, left, stands at the head of her 14 children at their family home in St Martin, Guernsey: From left to right, Indianna, three; Tallulah, four; Armani (known as Arnie), five; Nerilly-Jade, seven; Lilly-Arna eight; Charlie, nine; Febrianne, 10; Brittany, 11; Caitlin, 12; Georgia, 15; Mariah, 16; Shanice, 19; Bradley, 21; and Natasha 22

The family's bubble was burst four years ago when an accident meant John, 46, had to give up work as a lorry driver.

The
 financial pressure of caring for his 14 children meant John made a 
decision he will forever regret. As his health improved and with bills 
mounting, John claimed benefits while simultaneously taking some 
earnings.

He was caught, and the man who for 
two decades had been seen as the model father was sent to prison. The 
couple, who Joanne says had been arguing for years, separated and 
divorced.

'I feel pretty sore about what went 
on,' John says now. 'I've been married 20 years and been a good father. 
I've worked hard. Nobody can say I haven't, because I have.'

'I did get done for benefit fraud,' John admits.' But I paid my punishment, I went to prison and I paid all the money back.

Joanne leaps to her ex-husband's 
defence. 'He wasn't doing it to go on holidays and buy mobile phones,' 
Jo says. 'He was doing it to support us.'

The publicity the case attracted has 
made life - one that was already played out in the public eye - yet more
 difficult for the Watson children. Georgia, 15, says her regular 
appearance in the papers makes life at her school in St Martins very 
difficult.

'When we're in the papers, everyone 
talks about it at school the next day,' she says. 'Last time I was in 
the paper everyone was discussing it. People were leaving messages on my
 Facebook page. There were over 100 comments and not one of them good.

'A boy at school the next day saw me 
and said, "Oy, what's a Watson doing here?" I said I'd been here all 
along but he said I shouldn't be there because there was too many of us.

'We're only a family. We're like everyone else,' she adds.

But Georgia is not entirely like 
everyone else. She is a sweet, calm girl with an outlook that is mature 
beyond her years. She helps tirelessly at home: planning school uniforms
 and packed lunches for the rest of the children, bathing her 
three-year-old sister Indianna and putting her to bed.

While her home life is no doubt happy
 and full of love, she has, perhaps, missed out on some of the carefree 
moments that children in smaller families take for granted.

Son Bradley, a professional boxer, says the taunts are never-ending.

'If your name is Watson, it doesn't 
go down too well,' 21-year-old Bradley says evenly. 'They never say 
anything to my face, but your ears are always burning. I don't like it, 
but what can you do about it?'

But while the children of the 
household struggle with life under the microscope, Jo is defiant about 
the public's reaction to her and her brood.

'When I was in town this week, a 
woman looked at me and said, "Oh look, it's the baby-making machine." I 
just glared at her,' Jo adds. 'Sod them all,' she says. 'This is the way I am.'

Despite Jo's ability to rise above 
the attention though, it's clear that her children despair of their 
mother's continual procreation - and of their own cramped (if always 
neat and tidy) quarters.

'Our family is huge, laments one of 
the littlest boys. There's a new one born nearly every year. Being in a 
big family is horrible. If she has any more, that's it, this house won't
 fit us.'

Indeed, the house is full to 
bursting. With 11 children still living at home, getting ready for 
school is a military style operation, with little uniformed bodies 
filing out of the front door in a seemingly endless line. Packed lunches
 are a production line involving bags of fruit and dozens of sandwiches.
 There are mountains of washing to be done daily - 56 loads a month, to 
be precise.

Supplies, supplies: Joanne at home with her weekly shopping

Joanne pays only £27 a week rent for 
the house, a heavily subsidised fraction of the normal cost, receives a 
total of £160 a week in family allowance for the 11 children still 
living at home, and another £405 a week in supplementary benefit. But 
money is still tight, and a budget must be adhered to.

And since her marriage broke down, 
with a little help from her children, Jo has to do it all herself. But 
despite the workload, Joanne believes firmly that ending her crumbling 
marriage was the right thing to do.

'When I was expecting my 14th child, 
my husband phoned the papers to tell them so they could arrange a 
photoshoot. But I refused to do it. I couldn't go on playing happy 
families. It's not right. I couldn't take any more. The way we were 
arguing, I didn't want the children to hear it any more.'

Since her marriage broke down, Joanne
 has been on the look out for a new love - and hasn't given up on the 
idea of having another baby.

In the hopes of meeting a new man, 
Joanne signed up to local dating agencies. But even there she met with 
prejudice.

One dating agency refused point blank to have her on their 
books, saying the men they dealt with wouldn't want someone like Joanne.

'She made me cry,' says Joanne. 'She 
said the men wouldn't want someone on state benefits, with so many 
children, or living where I live.'

But Joanne has developed a thick 
skin. Last year, Joanne was left devastated when her pregnancy with what
 would be her fifteenth child ended in miscarriage. She had fallen 
pregnant just three weeks after embarking upon an affair with leisure 
centre worker Craig Le Sauvage, 35, who was an old neighbour.

Two weeks later, she split up from 
Craig, who subsequently told his story to the papers. Headlines 
appeared: "How I escaped the baby machine", talking of how Jo bombarded 
Craig with texts begging for a fifteenth baby. Joanne was devastated, 
but now says that nothing people say about her can match the hurt of 
losing the baby she named Billy. 

Fighting back tears, Jo looks through
 a box of scans and tiny foot and handprints from the little boy.  
'Holding his little body, seeing his tiny feet and hands. That hurts,' 
she says. 'People criticising me, slagging me off, that's not hurt.'

Joanne's 16-year-old daughter Mariah 
recently had her first child - making Joanne four times a grandmother. 
The media glare this brought upon the family (and their decision to take
 part in Channel 4 documentary 15 Kids and Counting, which aired last 
night) means the Watsons are unlikely to be out of the headlines any 
time soon.

But Joanne, who once enjoyed the fame and notoriety her large family brought her, now insists she regrets their infamy.

'I don't want anyone coming to our house looking for a dirty story,' says Joanne. I wish they would just leave us alone.'
