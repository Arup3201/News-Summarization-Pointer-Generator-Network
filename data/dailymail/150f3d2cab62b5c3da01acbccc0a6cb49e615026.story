If the summer heat is getting too much for you then ‘cooling’ space vests may be the answer.

Previously the reserve of astronauts and Formula 1 drivers, the Japanese Space Agency now wants to make the technology available to the public.

Jaxa recently announced it is selling a limited run of its vest for the price of £350 ($590).

The 'coat' uses a network of tubing and pumps to circulate coolant liquid around the body at a temperature of 4°C (39.2°F).

One litre (33.8 oz) of water can cool the vest for around 30 minutes, according to the space agency.

The vests can also absorb and evaporate sweat immediately, and are completely machine-washable.

The underwear was developed following a collaboration with Teikoku Sen-I Co, originally a manufacturer of linen, and now of disaster-prevention products.

While the garmet may help holiday goers keep cool, it also has some serious medical applications.

Similar Nasa vests have previously helped children with sweat gland disorders go outside without fear of heatstroke.

Nasa’s liquid-cooled garment was originally developed to protect the Apollo astronauts from the high temperatures on the moon.

But children with problems such as HED (hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia), who were unable to regulate body temperature, were able to use it to play outside during the day.

Jaxa said it will create a limited run of 1,000 vests which it plans to produce later this year.
