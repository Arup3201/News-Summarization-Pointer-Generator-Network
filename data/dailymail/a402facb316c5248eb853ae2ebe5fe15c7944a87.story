Growing numbers of the elderly and disabled are being looked after in ‘flying’ visits from carers that last just 15 minutes, a leading charity has warned.

UK charity Leonard Cheshire Disability said that time is so tight during the short home visits that some of the most vulnerable are forced to choose between having a cup of tea or being helped to go to the toilet.

Its call for an end to the ‘scandal of flying 15-minute visits’ is backed by TV presenter Esther Rantzen who said that the disabled are being treated ‘like products on a conveyor belt’.

The warning comes amid growing concern that cash-strapped councils are putting the elderly and disabled in danger by cutting back on the amount of time carers have to provide help with basic tasks, including dressing, bathing and heating up meals.

Rushed visits are particularly distressing for those with dementia and raise the odds that mistakes will be made when dispensing medication.

Leonard Cheshire Disability’s survey of English local authorities found that two-thirds are commissioning visits of just 15 minutes.

The figure is up 15 per cent on five years ago.

The responses from 63 councils revealed that in some areas, three-quarters of all home visits are completed in a quarter of an hour or less.

One 84-year-old woman who receives a 15-minute visit in the afternoon, said: ‘I end up choosing – have I got time to check if they can fill the hot water bottle?

TV personality Esther Rantzen said: 'I believe it is cruel to treat people like products on a conveyor belt'

‘Shall I choose between getting my meal prepared or them emptying my commode.

‘Do I get a drink or do I go to the toilet?

‘These visits are company.  I get really lonely and I rely on the visits of my carers but they are never stopping long.’

Claire Pelham, Leonard Cheshire Disabilty’s chief executive, said: ‘It is disgraceful to force disabled people to choose whether to go thirsty or go to the toilet by providing care visits as short as 15 minutes long.

‘Most of us need 40 minutes to get up, get washed and dressed and have breakfast in the morning.

‘We should demand better from our councillors and remind them that disabled people are real people with real feelings and should be treated as they themselves would wish to be treated – with kindness, with care and with respect.’

Dr Peter Carter, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘People with a disability should not have to make choices between on essential care function or another because visits are being scheduled for so little time.’

Esther Rantzen said: ‘I believe it is cruel to treat people like products on a conveyor belt.

‘Providing this kind of care is a personal service and should be accompanied by a conversation and at least half an hour of the car worker’s time.’

The charity is calling for the Care Bill, which will be debated in the House of Lords on Wednesday, to be amended to make care visits at least 30 minutes long.

But social care leaders said that sometimes 15-minute visits are ‘fully justified’.

Sandie Keene, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, said: ‘It is totally wrong to believe that all tasks need more than 15 minutes to carry out.

‘And frankly naive to believe that simply by abolishing 15-minute slots a magic wand will have been waved, and improvements automatically achieved in our care services. It doesn’t work like that.’
