A couple's dream honeymoon became a nightmare after they were struck down with stomach bugs. 

Just days after touching down in the Dominican Republic, Rebecca and Matthew Lott say they were infected with crippling gastric illnesses, turning their five-star getaway into a 'horrendous' ordeal.  

Matthew, 28, said the start of their wedded life together was ruined by the experience at the Caribe Princess Resort in June this year after they booked with Thomson Holidays, part of the TUI UK group. 

The couple's honeymoon to the five-star Caribe Princess Resort turned into a nightmare

They suffered from symptoms including diarrhoea, sickness, blood in their stools and fever from early in the first week of their two-week stay, and continued to feel the effects after they got back home to Prestwich. 

Account manager Matthew said: 'We'd had a perfect wedding day, it was everything we'd hoped for, but now our lasting memory of such a special time in our lives is clouded by the honeymoon, which was just a disaster. 

'We were concerned about the conditions at the hotel and both of us suffered from horrendous symptoms throughout our honeymoon and even now we are still suffering from on-going illness which has had a huge impact on our lives.' 

Following their wedding, Matthew and Rebecca Lott headed for their honeymoon to the Dominican Republic, where they contracted severe stomach illnesses

The honeymoon suite is advertised on the hotel's website as costing $2,324 (£1,500) for a two-week trip in June, excluding flights.

The newlyweds have now asked solicitors to investigate as they believe the resort was responsible for ruining their first trip as a married couple. 

The couple claim undercooked food was served throughout their stay, including raw pieces of chicken, and said flies swarmed over food being served, and birds flying around inside the restaurant were a regular sight.

Nichola Blackburn, from Irwin Mitchell solicitors, said: 'We are now investigating how our clients became ill during their honeymoon. 

'This was meant to be a holiday of a lifetime for Rebecca and Matthew who were celebrating the start of their married life. The illness they suffered ruined their holiday'. 

A Thomson spokeswoman said: 'We are sorry to hear of the Lotts' experience at the Caribe Princess Resort in the Dominican Republic this summer.

'Thomson closely audits all resorts to which we operate to ensure that health, hygiene and comfort levels are maintained in line with industry standards.

'As this case is now subject to legal proceedings it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.'
