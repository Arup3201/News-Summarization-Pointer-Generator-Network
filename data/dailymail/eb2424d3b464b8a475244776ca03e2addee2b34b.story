President Obama had some kind words for Hillary Clinton, saying that he knows she would be a 'very effective' president if she decides to run.

The President praised his former Secretary of State during an interview for Live with Kelly and Michael at the White House.

The interview aired Friday morning but was taped on Thursday- the same day that Obama secretly had lunch with Mrs Clinton.

Opening up: President Obama said that he and Hillary Clinton have become 'buddies' and though he doesn't know what she is going to do in 2016 but if she runs, she would be a 'very effective' president

'Hillary and I, we're buddies,' he said in the interview.

'I think because we ran in the longest primary in history and our staffs, I think, were doing battle politically, I think the perception was that this was always kind of a marriage of convenience when she came in as secretary of State.

'I always admired her. As soon as she got here, she couldn't have been more effective, more loyal and since that time, we've become really, really good friends.'

The lunch with Clinton- which was accidentally revealed by a People magazine editor who tweeted that Clinton was headed to meet Obama after her interview for the magazine- was an indication that the two have remained close in spite of her decision to step down from the State Department in January 2013.

Though his words were clearly 
positive, Obama made it clear that he was not leaving his Vice President
 out of the race entirely as well and was purposeful in mentioning Biden
 even though he was not in the conversation- or building- at the time.

'I
 think I've been blessed to have some people around me like her, and 
Vice President Biden, and my chief of staff who are just great, 
hard-working, effective people, and I love them to death,' Mr Obama 
said.

Cat out of the bag: The 'Live with Kelly and Michael' interview was taped on the same day that Clinton had a secret meeting with the President which was accidentally revealed by People magazine with this tweet

Not for her: President Obama said that his wife Michelle will never run for office

Clinton has not officially announced that she is running for president, and Obama admitted that he doesn't 'know what she's going to decide to do' in 2016 but she is seen as the one to beat.

One woman that apparently will never be challenging Clinton for a political position: Michelle Obama.

The president revealed in the interview with Kelly and Michael that his wife has no desire to run for office.

When asked by Kelly what he would say if Michelle turned to him in 10 years and said that she wanted to run for office, the President said: 'I would say where did you take my wife because I was sure there was an alien body-snatching going on.'

'One thing I can promise you is Michelle will not run for office.'
