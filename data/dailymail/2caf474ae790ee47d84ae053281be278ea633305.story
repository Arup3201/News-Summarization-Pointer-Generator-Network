A popularly held belief this summer is that Liverpool are in the midst of what has become known as ‘doing a Spurs’.

Anybody not affiliated with the club seems to be in agreement that spending so much on so many players is going to end badly. There is basis for this argument but Liverpool’s situation is very different this summer.

The comparisons, of course, stem from the fact that both clubs sold their best players for a handsome sum and went on something of a ‘spree’.

New boys: Liverpool signed Southampton duo Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert earlier this summer

Thumbs up: Many of Liverpool's signings were targets before Luis Suarez moved to Barcelona for £75m

Spending spree: Tottenham received £86million for Gareth Bale from Real Madrid last summer but many of the club's subsequent signings failed to impress last term

Unlike the situation Spurs faced last year though, Liverpool already had many of these targets in their sights, while not a single player signed so far has been acquired using the money made from Suarez. 

From as early as the end of last season, it was clear that Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Emre Can were already targets.

In the cases of Lallana and Lambert, Liverpool have signed two experienced Premier League players, with great track records and, while this is not a guarantee of success it makes that ‘bedding in’ period all the more easy. 

Not only this, but Lambert is a low-risk signing given his experience and small fee, whilst Lallana – who may miss the first couple of fixtures with a knee injury - was in the Premier League team of the year, so you can’t really ask for more of an indication of a ‘good buy’.

Signed: Liverpool completed a deal to sign young Lille frontman Divock Origi on Tuesday

And while Dejan Lovren only has one season of Premier League experience, he adapted very well to its rigours, and played in the Champions League for previous clubs Lyon and Dinamo Zagreb.

Many may see £20 million as a lot for Lovren, given he’s had just one season in the Premier League but you’re unlikely to get a top international defender for less these days and again, his experience in the Premier League means there will be little-to-no transition period.

As for Can and Lazar Markovic, both are still unknown quantities but they are as much ‘for the future’ as they are first-team guarantees and all indications from pre-season are that both will grow to become superb players.

All smiles: Dejan Lovren joined Liverpool in a £20million move from Southampton earlier this month

The transfer of Loic Remy obviously fell through amid suggestions the Frenchman failed a medical, which was a shame as he would have been snip at £8.5million.

So, the Reds will continue looking elsewhere for a striker replacement for Luis Suarez, while at the same time Fabio Borini could still leave for Sunderland in a whopping £14million deal.

All things considered, Liverpool’s business has so far been positive. No signings have yet got fans salivating with excitement, but should Brendan follow through on some of the reported interest in the likes of Karim Benzema, Isco or Marco Reus, then this could go down as Liverpool’s most fruitful summer in over a decade.
