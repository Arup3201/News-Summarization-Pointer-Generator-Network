Counter-terrorism police have conducted more raids following major operations in Sydney and Brisbane that saw four people charged, including one accused of plotting to kidnap and kill members of the public.

The additional search warrants were carried out on Thursday night, according to Australian Federal Police acting commissioner Andrew Colvin.

Police were still  turning up backyards late into the night looking for weapons and evidence following the biggest anti-terrorism raids in Australian history.

Mr Colvin would not reveal further details but said the investigation was far from over.

A 'number of people' were still being detained following the raids in Brisbane and Sydney on Thursday morning.

Omarjan Azari appeared in Sydney's Central Local Court charged with conspiracy to prepare a terrorist attack on Australian soil

Omarjan Azari, 22, was the first to be charged in the nation's largest counter-terrorism operation.

He appeared in court on Thursday charged with a conspiracy to prepare a terrorist attack on Australian soil.

According to court documents, police intercepted a phone call three days ago between Omarjan Azari and Mohammad Ali Baryalei, who is alleged to have recruited half of the 60 Australians fighting in the Middle East.

The account said Baryalei ordered him to carry out an attack, which Sydney Central Local Court heard was 'clearly designed to shock, horror and terrify the community'.

A second man, a 24-year-old from Merrylands in Sydney's west, was charged with possessing ammunition without license and unauthorised possession of a prohibited weapon.

He has been bailed to appear in Fairfield Local Court on September 24th.

Nine people were detained on Thursday, and two females were issued Future Court Attendance Notices.

It comes as Prime Minister Tony Abbott revealed on Friday morning that terrorists were 'within days' of carrying out planned attacks on Parliament House and a possible public beheading on Sydney streets.

He said the detainees were people 'of interest to our police and security services in connection with terrorist events we believe, on the basis of intelligence, were likely within a few days'.

Mr Abbott said the national security challenge was 'more serious today than at any time in the past'.

'It is a serious situation when all you need to do to carry out a terrorist attack is to have a knife, an iPhone and a victim,' he said.

The prime minister said he had been advised in early September of potential threats to 'government, government people and Parliament House'.

This triggered a review of security and a decision to put the AFP in charge of internal and external security of the parliament.

'The community expects government at all levels to keep them safe and this government will not let them down.'

About 12 homes were searched in Sydney's northwest suburbs by NSW Police and Australian Federal Police (AFP). 

Police executed search warrants in Beecroft, Bellavista, Guildford, Merrylands, Northmead, Wentworthville, Marsfield, Westmead, Castle Hill, Revesby, Bass Hill and Regents Park. 

The AFP also carried out three search warrants in Brisbane in the suburbs of Mount Gravatt East, Logan and Underwood. 

The Queensland raids were not directly related to the operations in Sydney.

Omarjan Azari's lawyer Steve Boland did not apply for bail for the accused terrorist but asked Magistrate Richard Bailey if Azari could go back down to the dock during the hearing.

Magistrate Bailey agreed and Azari, who had sat in the dock stroking his beard and smiled briefly while talking to Mr Boland, left the courtroom. 

He is due to reappear in court via video link from prison on November 13.

The accused terrorist was taken from court in a high risk security orange prison jumpsuit by heavily armed NSW Corrective Services officers.

Officers with shotguns drove Azari - who put his head down between his handcuffs in the back seat of an armoured vehicle - from Central Local Court where the Sydney man made a brief appearance.

As a person accused of conspiracy to prepare for a terrorist act, Azari will be taken to a maximum security prison, most likely the High Risk Management Correctional Centre - also known as Supermax - inside Goulburn prison.

'Police believe that this group that we have executed this operation on today had the intention, and had started to carry out planning, to commit violent acts here in Australia,' AFP Acting Commissioner Andrew Colvin told reporters in Sydney. 

'Those violent acts particularly related to random acts against members of the public.' 

Police sources revealed more details to Daily Mail Australia, that the plot involved abducting a member of the public in Sydney and beheading them. ABC reported that the abducted member of the public would be draped in an Islamic State flag and beheaded on camera. 

Channel Seven reports that the random beheading would have been carried out in the streets of Martin Place in Sydney's CBD.
