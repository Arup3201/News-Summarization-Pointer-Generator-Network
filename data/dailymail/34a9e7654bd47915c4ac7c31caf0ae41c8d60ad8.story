A 26-year-old Florida woman may never walk again after her kind gesture to offer a stranger a ride to the hospital turned into a nightmare attack that has ruined her life.

Tallahassee-resident Katie Schlinger told her traumatic story to MailOnline, revealing details about the night she offered to drive a stranger to the hospital before 'he physically and sexually attacked her'.

Ms Schlinger says she fought back and escaped with her life, but two spinal surgeries later, she still can't use her right arm or walk on her own. And since she's uninsured, she already owes one hospital $250,000 and is about to be kicked out of a third.

Survivor: 26-year-old Katie Schlinger survived a horrific attack late last month when she offered to drive a stranger to the hospital

It all goes back to December 20 when
 Ms Schlinger was in Aiken, South Carolina, to support her brother as he
 underwent open heart surgery at Aiken Regional Medical Center.

Arrested: 23-year-old Michael Antwon Fuller is currently facing charges in Schlinger's attack. He was found semi-conscious in her car with a pistol

She
 was smoking a cigarette in the car at the nearby Quality Inn around 4am
 when she was approached by 23-year-old Michael Antwon Fuller who asked 
her for a cigarette and the two started talking about their relatives in
 the hospital.

Fuller 
told her he was worried about his uncle at the hospital and wondered if 
she wouldn’t mind driving him up there so he could see him.

‘Yeah
 I’ll give you a ride if you promise not to hurt me,’ she joked, 
agreeing to drive him since the hospital was only four minutes away and 
Fuller was clean cut, well-spoken and well dressed.

‘Who could hurt that precious face?’  Ms Schlinger recalls him responding.

As
 they drove up to the hospital, Ms Schlinger began to turn into the main 
entrance but Fuller told her it was a different entrance. The second 
entrance was the emergency entrance and he told her not to turn there 
either, she told MailOnline.

From there the road
 went pitch black and when Ms Schlinger turned to tell him she didn’t think
 there was another entrance, he allegedly hit her face with the mouth of his gun. 

Ms Schlinger
 says she started to cry and begged him to take her car or her money, 
but she says he told her to just keep driving and hit her on the head with his 
pistol. 

She agreed 
and started driving but slowly moved her hand to the door handle. She 
hit the gas right before she opened the door and hurled herself out of 
the moving vehicle. 

By the time she stopped rolling and got up, Fuller had somehow put the car in park and caught up with her, she said.

Outside of the car, she says he pointed his gun at her and forced her to perform oral sex.

‘I
 kept begging him not to rape me,’ she said. Hoping to save herself, she
 offered to drive him to an ATM and give him all the money in her bank 
account.

Totaled: Schlinger tried to escape by reversing her Dodge Durango towards the emergency hospital area. It hit a tree and the crash caused Fuller to pass out

‘I lied and told him I had thousands of dollars in my bank account. I didn’t have thousands of dollars,’ she said.

‘I knew if I kept driving I was going to die, so I put the car in reverse and aimed for the emergency hospital area.’

According to Ms Schlinger, Fuller
 tried to stop her, continuing to hit her on the head with his pistol 
before moving over onto her lap to try to control the car.

The two were fighting over the wheel and the car propelled into a tree, totalling the $8,000 Dodge 
Durango she just paid off.

Even
 though the crash happened right in front of the hospital, no one seemed
 to notice the crash so when she came to, Schlinger was still alone in 
the car with Fuller – trapped underneath him from their struggle.

The bill: Since the attack, uninsured Schlinger has been treated at three hospitals and already racked up a $250,000 bill already

She
 says it took nearly half an hour to move his weight off her without 
waking him. She decided it was safer to climb out the window than open 
the door which she thought would wake him up as well. After falling out of the car she crawled to a bush to hide, and eventually a car went by that brought her to the hospital.

Survivor: Friends of the 26-year-old are currently raising money online for cover some of her medical bills

While
 Schlinger was being treated at the hospital, police arrived on the 
scene and found Fuller still in the car, semi-conscious with the pistol.

Fuller was arrested 
and is facing charges of kidnapping, criminal sexual conduct, unlawful 
carrying of a pistol and possession of a weapon with the commission of a
 crime.

Ms Schlinger, who is still recovering
 from the accident at a rehabilitation center, describes the experience 
as horrific and says she still continually wakes up with night terrors.

'It's been awful. It's been the most painful, traumatic experience of my life. The man ruined my life,' she said.

But it was just the beginning of the nightmare. Doctors 
treated Ms Schlinger at Aiken before transferring her to MCG Health 
Systems in Augusta, Georgia where she underwent two spinal surgeries.

At
 first, doctors said she would never be able to walk again and though 
there’s now hope that she’ll regain some of that movement, at the very 
least she’ll have to carry a cane for the rest of her life.

Because
 she is uninsured, she was dismissed from the second hospital but her 
victim advocate was able to secure her transfer to a $2,000 a day rehab 
facility for a free 10 day stay which she started on Friday.

Schlinger
 says she was told she needs at least four months of rehab to regain 
skills like writing again, but has to do as much as she can with the 10 
days she has.

‘I can’t write, I can’t dress myself, I can’t do anything, I can’t brush my teeth by myself, I have to relearn,’ she said. It also doesn't help that she won't soon be able to go back to her job at a storage facility, since she can't type or move.

She hasn’t gotten the bill from the Aiken hospital yet, but the total for MCG is already 250,000.

Friends
 and family have started an online campaign to raise $100,000 to cover 
some of her medical bills. As of early Sunday, they had raised over 
$9,000 of that goal.
