When Kelly Lynn Miller appeared at a press conference in Thailand on Wednesday, the American fugitive didn't appear to take the hearing about her extradition very seriously - resting her head on her hands in boredom and casually applying lip-gloss through the proceedings.

Authorities say the 36-year-old has been on the run for six years after fleeing the U.S.  to avoid a five-year prison sentence for killing truck driver Donald Goodwin, 57, in a 2004 drunk-driving accident. She managed to evade detection, and even give birth recently, by constantly moving around a set of Thai islands.

On Thursday,  Goodwin's younger sister Faye Dees spoke out to the Daily Mail Online, saying she wasn't at all surprised by Miller's nonchalant behavior in Thailand based on how she reacted to her brother's death and interacted with the family at trial nearly a decade ago.

Victim: Kelly Lynn Miller, right, was arrested in Thailand on Tuesday after  years on the run. She was supposed to report to prison for hitting and killing truck-driver Donald Goodwin, left, in 2004, but instead fled the country

Dees, 66, says Miller didn't even try to help her brother after fatally striking him with her car in 2004, according to a witness at the scene who spoke to her.

‘She didn’t seem too concerned about Donny’s life according to the first witness on the scene. She didn't even know she had hit him,' Dees said. 

When the witness asked Miller if she knew Goodwin, she 'didn't even know who he was talking about'.

The witness 'ran up there immediately to see if he would render any help and [Miller] just got on the phone and started calling for help. She was just so uncaring.’

Unmoved: On Thursday, Goodwin's sister spoke out to the Daily Mail Online, and said she was surprised by Miller's nonchalant behavior at a press conference in Thailand on Wednesday (above). Faye Dees, 66, says Miller acted similarly during her homicide trial in 2006 and 2007

Return: On Wednesday, Thai police held a conference announcing the arrest of Miller and her upcoming extradition back to the U.S. She reportedly gave birth to a baby boy two months ago, who will also be sent back to the U.S. 

Goodwin had apparently pulled over to the emergency lane to check the tires on his tractor-trailer when Miller drunkenly swerved and side-swept the hauler - instantly killing Goodwin, according to AL.com. 

When Dees was finally able to confront Miller at her sentencing hearing in 2007, she and the rest of the Goodwin family were met with 'attitude' from the convict.

'When we were allowed to get up and make a comment to the judge...there were times she had facial expressions like "I can’t believe what you’re saying." She just had an impression like she just didn’t understand what the big deal was,' Dees recalled. 

Dees says she and the rest of the family first found out about Miller's arrest Wednesday afternoon, when a reporter contacted her elderly mother, 87. 

'She was pretty upset about it. She lives alone and she’s wasn’t feeling particularly well and she got the news just out of the blue...She was really too upset to talk.,' Dees said.  

She says before his death, Goodwin purchased a 7-acre property across the street from his mother's house and had taken time off to care for her when she underwent a quadruple bi-pass surgery.

Another life: Miller said the father of her child is an American national living in Thailand legally, who did not know she was a fugitive 

'He was counting down the days to when he could retire,' Dees said. 'He was going to retire at 62 and he was just trying to work on his little piece of land.' 

Goodwin left behind a son now in his 30s, also named Donald, and was divorced. 

Goodwin's younger brother Larry also spoke with the Daily Mail Online, and said his brother's passing was 'real tough' on the son.  

When asked what she would tell Miller, if she had the opportunity, Dees said: 'I would just let her know that the whole family is elated that she has finally been caught. We didn’t think she ever would be, but justice is going to prevail for her.'

'I hope she has additional time added onto the original sentence and I hope it’s as much as they can possibly give her. I don’t know what they can do. I hope she doesn’t get off any time for good behavior or anything like that.

‘[Goodwin's] life did matter to his family and to people that cared about him. It may not have mattered to her,' Dees said. 

Miller is set to be extradited back to the U.S. soon. 

She was arrested Tuesday on the remote island of Koh Lanta, according to the Thai publication Phutketwan, about a month after authorities received a tip.

Tourist Police officials said the 36-year-old woman had been moving between Koh Lanta, Samui and Hang islands without a current visa.

Investigators said Miller delivered her son two months ago in a small clinic on the island of Samui, and his birth was not registered. It's believed that the father is an American national living in Thailand legally. The baby will also be deported back to the U.S. 

Thai authorities believe Miller's relatives in the US had been wiring money to her to help her make ends meet.

After the 2004 crash, Miller was arrested  on DUI charges but released the next day after posting $1,000 bond.

In 2006, a Jefferson County jury indicted Miller on a charge of vehicular homicide. She was re-arrested but again freed from jail after posting $10,000 bond.

Miller was expected to go on trial in January 2007 but pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years in prison.

Before Miller was set to report to prison, she took off and was officially declared a fugitive in 2010.

Following her arrest in Thailand Tuesday, Miller allegedly admitted to police that she flew into Bangkok in January 2009 and then spent the next six years traveling on an expired visa.
