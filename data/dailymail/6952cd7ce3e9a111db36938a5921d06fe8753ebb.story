Troubled: Former England star Paul Gascoigne has revealed that he downed dozens of bottles of children's medicine Calpol in a desperate bid to get drunk

Troubled England football legend Paul Gascoigne drank dozens of bottles of children's medicine Calpol in a desperate bid to get drunk, he admitted today.

The alcoholic 45-year-old has admitted that he became hooked on the pink liquid because he wrongly thought it would get him drunk.

The situation became so serious that he was banned from every chemist in Newcastle after staff realised what he was doing.

Speaking to The Sun, the former midfielder, who was released from a clinic in the U.S following five weeks of treatment for alcoholism said:

'It was crazy. I thought it had 0.00001 per cent alcohol in it and I thought if I drank enough it would get us drunk, because I didn't want to be seen drinking. I had loads of bottles.'

Gascoigne admitted that he eventually sought treatment to come off the medicine after he was turned away from a chemist after a member of staff quizzed him about why he needed it.

He also admitted going into rehab for laxatives and Red Bull. Calpol is a paracetamol-based medicine which can caused fatal liver and kidney damage when taken in high doses.

Gascoigne also spoke about his bizarre bid to help police killer Raoul Moat after he turned up at a police seige with a fishing rod, chicken and lagers.

The former football star left police officers and watching media shocked when he arrived at the police cordon in Rothbury, Northumberland, during the climax of the manhunt in 2010.

Gascoigne thought he knew the crazed gunman from his work as a bouncer at a Newcastle club and 'without thinking' decided to go and help him after seeing news reports.

But during his interview with The Sun, he admitted he didn't know what he was doing and said it was an example of how serious his drink problem had become.

Gunman Moat shot his former girlfriend Samantha Stobbart and murdered her new boyfriend Christoper Brown in Birtley, Gateshead, before blinding PC David Rathband as he sat in his patrol car.

The officer saved his own life by pretending to be dead and said afterwards it was the thought of his children that kept him fighting for survival.

The rampage sparked a week long manhunt which ended when the 37-year-old shot himself in July 2010.

PC Rathband, 44, was blinded after being shot in the face by killer Moat in July 2010 and after struggling to come to terms with his disability was found hanged in February 2012.

Gascoigne also revealed yesterday how a DVD 
message from Sir Alex Ferguson helped save his life during his five-week
stay in a U.S. rehab clinic.

He said he watched the Manchester United manager and family and friends make emotional appeals for him to battle his demons.

Gascoigne said: 'I was blown away watching people like Sir Alex telling me to stay strong and pull through.

'Sir Alex reminded me I'm a fighter. 
He said he was speaking on behalf of all the United players and everyone
was rooting for me,' he told The Sun.

Gascoigne spent three days in a coma after an
adverse reaction to detoxification and said doctors spent two weeks 
trying to save his life.

Gascoigne gave special
praise and thanks on friends DJ Chris Evans and ex-cricketer Ronnie 
Irani for organising the finances to pay for his treatment.

Hundreds
of thousands of pounds were raised within just days to meet the 
Â£7,500-a-week clinic fees. Footballers including Arsenal's Jack Wilshere
and Liverpool's Steven Gerrard put their hands in their pockets to help
the stricken star.
