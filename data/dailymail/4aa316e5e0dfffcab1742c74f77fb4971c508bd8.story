Immigrants from the Middle East seeking asylum in the UK  will face tough new language tests after 100 per cent of applicants claiming to be Palestinians were found to be lying. 

Experts in Arabic dialects and accents will also check applicants from Syria and Kuwait.

Mark Harper said 'linguistic analysis' will be used on those that are believed to be lying about their origins

The Government made the move after a pilot scheme revealed that on top of the bogus Palestineian applications, 80 per cent of asylum seekers who claimed to have fled the war in Syria had also lied about their country of origin, along with 79 per cent from Kuwait.

Immigration Minister Mark Harper said that ‘linguistic analysis’ will be used on applicants if it is strongly suspected that claims about their origin are  false and they do not have any documents to prove where they have come from. 

Mr Harper said the language testing would be voluntary, but anyone who refused to take it would have their decision ‘taken  into account against them’.

Arabic is the main language of the Middle East and North Africa. However, there are notable differences in dialect, accent and vocabulary in the Middle East.  

Now applicants claiming to be Palestinian, Kuwaiti or Syrian  will be assessed after speaking  to an Arabic expert in their native dialect.
