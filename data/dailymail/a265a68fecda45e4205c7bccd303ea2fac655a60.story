Separated: Martina Hingis and her ex-husband Thibault Hutin during happier times

The husband of the former Swiss tennis champion, Martina Hingis, claims he had to flee to France to escape his estranged wife and her mother, saying they assaulted him, tried to steal his car and threatened by text message to 'set the Russians on him'.

Thibault Hutin, 27, a French equestrian, said that 32-year-old Hingis and her mother, Melanie Molitor, beat him and scratched during a dispute at their apartment in the Swiss village of Feusisberg.

Molitor's boyfriend Mario Widmer also hit him in the head with a DVD player, Hutin claimed.

Hutin - who accused his wife of serial adultery when the couple separated in July - said he believed Hingis had tried to break into his car a few days before, as he could see that someone had tampered with it and she was the only person other than himself  to have a key to the garage.

'As far as I was concerned, there was only one possible culprit: Martina!' he said.

Hutin, who has yet to finalise his divorce with the tennis player, said Hingis had made off with his passport and credit cards when he fled the apartment.

'I have bruises and scratches on the neck, head and right forearm,' he told the Swiss newspaper Blick. 'I'm really scared and asking myself, what comes next - a bullet?

'They wanted to massacre me - I'm shocked! What comes next - a bullet?'

'I have been brought up never to hit a
woman,' he said. 'I fought back because Mario Widmer - Melanie's 
partner - hit me on the head with the DVD player.'

Police
in the central Swiss canton of Schwyz confirmed that Hutin had called 
them, and that they had been called to deal with a family argument on 
the evening Hutin described.

Hutin
said he had to ask police to retrieve his passport and credit cards 
from the apartment, and had left Switzerland for Paris where he felt 
'safe from them'.

'They wanted to massacre me,' he said. 'I'm shocked! I'd never have thought it would come so far.

'First she betrays me, then she tries to break into my car. Now she's attacking me physically and stealing my possessions.

'Most
recently I have even received a text threatening  to set the Russians on me.

'I don't know how much further this is going 
to go.'

Star: Martina Hingis won three consecutive Australian Opens, one Wimbledon title and one US Open between 1997 and 1999

Hingis would not comment, while Widmer said the allegations were 'ridiculous'.

The Slovakian-born, Swiss-raised Hingis was the world's number one women’s singles player for 209 weeks, winning three consecutive Australian Opens, one Wimbledon title and one U.S. Open between 1997 and 1999.

She also held the world number one doubles ranking for 35 weeks, making her one of just five women in history to have been the world number one in singles and doubles simultaneously.Hingis won nine doubles titles and one mixed doubles title for a total of 15 major titles in her career.

After an early retirement due to injury in 2002 at the age of 22, Hingis made a return to tennis in 2006 but quit in 2007 after testing positive for cocaine in a routine drug test.

She denied using the drug but opted not to contest the ban imposed by the International Tennis Federation and bowed out instead.

Since retirement, Hingis has been active with World Team Tennis, and has been coaching up-and-coming young tennis players.

In 2009, she competed in the UK dance competition Strictly Come Dancing but was eliminated in the first week.
