The Great British boozer - for many beer-swilling Brits it's a treasured national institution.

But, new research has claimed the humble pub may have been invented by, of all people, the French.

According to drinks industry expert and author Ted Bruning, the first drinking houses to serve paying guests alcohol were set up by Norman conquerors just after 1066.

Following William of Normandy's victory at the Battle of Hastings, the invaders set up watering holes for visiting French merchants.

Zut alors! New research claims the Great British pub is in fact... French

According to drinks industry expert and author Ted Bruning pubs originated after the Norman conquest in 1066 when the invading French needed watering holes for their merchants

And worse still for those who cherish the more traditional British ideal, these were wine bars in the City of London - not the genteel country tavern we've become accustomed to.

They would predate the first English-style 'alehouses' by around 150 years, said drinks industry expert and author Ted Bruning after spending 30 years trying to find Britain's oldest pubs.

After the Norman invasion of 1066, a wave of French merchants travelled to and from London to buy and sell wares from the banks of the Thames.

The wealthy merchants would arrive at The Vintry, the wharf full of wine warehouses in the City of London.

So, traders based there decided to open up areas of the wharf to sell glasses of wine to the visiting merchants and the crews of the ships.

And these, Mr Bruning claims in his new book Merrie England: The Medieval Roots of the Great British Pub, may well be the earliest known examples of pubs as we know them today.

Other theories have claimed pubs started in Roman times as roadside stalls serving wine to marching soldiers while beer became popular a lot later as a hygienic alternative to the disease ridden water system in Britain.

While there are pubs around the country claiming to go back further because they are on sites which may once have served some kind of alcohol.

But drinks experts continue to argue over what constitutes the first ever pub as we know them today said Mr Bruning, who used to write for the Campaign for Real Ale.

Ted Bruning said: 'It can't be absolutely proved that the Great British Pub originated as a City wine bar where French speaking expats chose to hang out.

'But I can't find any trace of anything resembling a pub in Anglo-Saxon times, so by a process of elimination I can only conclude - however much I dread to say it - that the Normans invented the pub.'

The first alehouse, which would have brewed and sold beer, appears to have arrived much later, in 1212, in south London are The Great Fire of Southwark.

Ancient documents relate to new safety regulations for buildings in the area including some which mention premises making and selling beer.
