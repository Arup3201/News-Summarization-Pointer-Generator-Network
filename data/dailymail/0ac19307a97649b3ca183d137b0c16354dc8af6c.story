The snap was taken by Tampa Police Department's Marine Patrol unit on Saturday morning after it was called to rescue the dog.

Residents in Tampa's Seminole Heights neighborhood saw the dog, named White Boy, struggling to climb out of the water after hearing a strange noise coming from the river the previous night.

The officer who rescued the dog, Randy Lopez, a 30-year veteran of the department's Marine Patrol Unit, said both the fresh water and the commotion likely drew in the manatee

'You don't see that every day, and it's a great reminder... the importance of kindness.'

The officer who rescued the dog, Randy Lopez, a 30-year veteran of the department's Marine Patrol Unit, told ABC News both the fresh water and the movement of the dog struggling probably attracted the manatee.

'They're curious by nature so I'm sure the the sound of the dog splashing in the water trying to get up the sea wall got his attention and he came over to investigate, maybe calm the dog and tell him it was going to be alright,' he said.

A police department spokeswoman told ABC News the dog was reunited with its owners.

White Boy had suffered bug bites and had bloody paws but was otherwise it was not injured.

The dog seemed happy to be back with his owners on dry land after his ordeal
