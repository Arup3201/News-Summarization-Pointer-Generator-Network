To his millions of followers, Kevin Pietersen presented a picture of a loyal man who had been forced into exile from the country he loves.

Twenty-four hours after being dismissed by England, Pietersen took to Instagram to post a picture of him looking distraught after his final Test innings in Sydney as England crashed to a defeat that sealed their 5-0 Ashes humiliation.

‘So sad that this will now be the last time I leave a field in an England shirt,’ posted Pietersen. ‘I love England and honestly hope they have every success in the future.’

Sweet words, but those who observed him in the England dressing room saw a different side of KP.

Sportsmail can
 reveal that as soon as Pietersen was away from the public eye in the 
Sydney pavilion he whistled happily all the way into the England 
dressing room and continued as he sat down in his place alongside 
team-mates.

Pietersen’s 
apparent nonchalance over his dismissal, at the start of an embarrassing
 clatter of wickets that left English cricket as a complete laughing 
stock, shocked his team-mates and the England management.

Some
 senior England figures believe he departed the international scene with
 a whiff of hypocrisy. His actions were considered another example of 
the attitude and poor example that had completely exasperated senior 
figures and convinced them it was the end of the road for their gifted 
maverick.

‘It said everything about his apparent commitment to England,’ one of the people in that dressing room told Sportsmail on Thursday, ‘It confirmed we had lost our way, lost the team ethos that had taken us so far.’

In
 isolation it may not seem too serious but to a chastened England, who 
had welcomed Pietersen back after the Andrew Strauss text-gate scandal, 
it was pretty much the final straw.

Pietersen
 had started the Ashes as an integrated part of the England group but as
 time went on old habits began to creep back, with his behaviour 
starting to deteriorate after the Perth Test.

Sportsmail’s
 information is that Pietersen was perceived to be  undermining coach 
Andy Flower, whom Pietersen tried to oust as batting coach when he led 
his failed coup against Peter Moores in 2008, and whose relationship 
never recovered from ‘text-gate’.

Out of place? He was a character, but South African-born Pietersen never belonged

There
 was the pivotal team meeting after the Melbourne Test, revealed in 
these pages on Thursday, where Pietersen misjudged the mood of other 
players and started trying to garner support for his anti-Flower stance.

Pietersen’s
 decision to whistle a happy tune after his demise in the final Test was
 not the only time he clashed with his team-mates in Sydney.

Reports that he squared up to captain Alastair Cook are wide of the mark but the pair, Sportsmail
 understands, did disagree over the best preparation for the final Test.
 Cook wanted to concentrate on fitness, where England had been found 
wanting, whereas Pietersen thought they should be working on skills.

It was then that Flower confronted Pietersen over what he saw as 
attempts to turn younger players against him after the  Melbourne 
meeting and decided in his mind that England’s record runscorer had to 
go if they were going to emerge from the ashes of their worst ever tour 
with their team principles reinstated.

Critic: Pietersen told Andy Flower the issues that the England players had with his management

At
 that stage it looked sure that Flower was going to stay to oversee that
 rebuilding process but even after he resigned last Friday Pietersen had
 fallen out with far too many important figures for any sort of reprieve
 to be granted.

He was told 
his fate on Monday night, ahead of a final meeting between Cook, 
managing director Paul Downton and one-day coach Ashley Giles, and knew 
that his England career was over when he conducted a coaching session at
 The Kia Oval on Tuesday. It was confirmed by the ECB on Wednesday.

It
 is important these details emerge because the ECB remain adamant that 
they cannot publicly say what Pietersen has done wrong for legal 
reasons, with the last details of Pietersen’s contract settlement still 
being finalised.

That 
decision is leaving them open to ridicule from England fans, who expect a
 proper  explanation. There was even support for Pietersen on Thursday, 
from Prime Minister David Cameron as only a one-sided version of events 
has so far emerged.

Re-integrated: Team-mate Matt Prior posted this picture of Pietersen on Twitter in late 2012 with the caption: '"Re-integration complete. Well played".'

James 
Whitaker, the new national selector, became the first man involved in 
the seismic decision to speak publicly about the sacking on Thursday, 
but his appearance on Sky TV was little more than an embarrassing 
shambles.

No newspapers were
 allowed at the announcement of England’s squad for their tours of West 
Indies and Bangladesh and Whitaker’s answers to Sky’s Tim Abraham, who 
was admirable in the circumstances, seemed strictly controlled.

However,
 the usually personable Whitaker did allow himself to say of Pietersen’s
 sacking: ‘In a way it was a tricky decision but in another way it gives
 other players an opportunity to excel in that environment. There is a 
legal position and I’m not at liberty to say anything else.

‘Any
 team has certain values that good teams adhere to and carry with them. 
England over the past four or five years have shown these good values. 
Over time they can (slip) a bit but now is the time to rewrite those. We
 want to win back the positive perception of what the England team are 
all about.’

It has been a 
miserable week for that objective and England clearly remain paranoid 
about any confidentiality clause in their agreement with Pietersen. But 
if one exists, isn’t Pietersen breaking it by leaking details of the 
Melbourne team meeting to his mouthpiece Piers Morgan?

Pietersen’s
 attack on Prior, the most selfless of England players, via Morgan on 
Twitter on Wednesday was a spectacular own goal for his status as a 
martyr and perhaps revealing of the real reasons behind his departure.

And surely it frees up senior England figures to say far more than Whitaker managed on Thursday.
