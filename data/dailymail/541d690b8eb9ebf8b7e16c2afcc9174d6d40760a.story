One of the secrets of Frank Maloney’s success – although not the biggest secret as it turns out - was that he was one of the lads.

A cheeky South London chappie and a tough-nut Millwall fan, he invariably celebrated his triumphs as manager of world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis by enjoying a night out with the boys at one or other of those flesh-pots which are euphemistically known as gentlemen’s clubs.

The loyalty which is bred into most working-class road warriors was also fundamental to Maloney’s solid relationships with Lewis and all the boxers in his stable.

Maloney was both a promoter and manager and the boxers he has worked with include...

Lennox Lewis 

David Price

Rendall Munroe

John McDermott

David Haye

Julius Francis 

Jon Lewis Dickinson

They trusted him, they felt safe confiding in him and some of them over-achieved because his belief in them never wavered.

He managed and promoted them with a passionate machismo, fighting their corner as fiercely as they battled in the prize ring.

So no, I did not see this coming and I will be surprised if anyone else did outside the very immediate family circle.

Frank – or Kellie as she now wishes to be known – is a good pal, an entertaining dinner companion, a boxing brain worth picking and will remain so.

The Mental Midget – as dubbed by legendary US promoter Don King during one of their feuds – always has been a character larger than that diminuitive stature.

Now that the Union Jack suit worn while working the corner of Lewis and David Haye on big world title fight nights has been exchanged for female attire that figure will become one of bizarre fascination, also.

Maloney’s effervescent sense of humour will help cope with the curiosity, however morbid, and once the shock at the sex change has subsided she will chuckle along with the inevitable jokes which are already rife on the social media,

The major concern will be the fall-out for those three beloved daughters from two marriages.

Glove story: Maloney is best known for managing Lewis, who rose to become world heavyweight champion

As for Kellie, nee Frank, the hide of a rhino developed in the concrete jungle of prize-fighting should deflect even the most wounding of the barbs.

Maloney was derided at first for bringing Lewis back to his London birthplace from Canada,the country where he had spent most of his formative years and for which he had won his Olympic gold medal.

The mood in Britain changed as Maloney’s prediction that he was bringing home this country’s first world heavyweight champion for more than a century began to look accurate.

So persuasive was Maloney that the Americans began to believe in Lewis, also. So firmly that Riddick Bowe – the same Big Daddy who had dethroned the great Evander Holyfield - preferred to dump his WBC belt In a dustbin rather than defend that cherished, linear title in London.

During their 12 years together Maloney guided Lewis onwards to the undisputed world championship and Lennox the Lion is still the most recent heavyweight to hold that distinction.

Maloney’s negotiating skills allied to the exceptional power and natural talent of Lewis generated one of the most successful partnerships in the history of the British ring.

Their friendship survived their professional split in 2001.

Maloney guided Haye to his first world title, at cruiserweight before the Hayemaker took his swing at the heavyweight division, and also helped Scott Harrison and Paul Ingle to similar glory.

There were dozens of British champions and Maloney looked to be on the brink of helping another domestic heavyweight to a world belt until David Price suffered consecutive stoppage defeats by American Tony Thompson

Maloney had been against Price rushing into that re-match and soon after, last October, the retirement announcement came: ‘I’ve fallen out of love with boxing and no longer feel I can continue to give it my best efforts.’

Now we know there were other demons haunting one of the most popular personalities in the hardest game. Perhaps, as Maloney retreated with greater frequency from the family house in Kent to a second home in Portugal, we might have suspected some kind of identity crisis.

But, no, there was not even an inkling of trans-sexual feelings, gender re-orientation or hormone treatment in preparation for an operation. Not in this corner. Nor so much as a hint of uncomfortable behaviour at public or social occasions.

When Maloney was voted Promoter of the Year by the Boxing Writers’ Association of America - perhaps the most important of several individual accolades – I was invited to New York to make the presentation and he was saluted with affection by many of the biggest names in the sport in the US.

The majority of what Maloney called ‘my special bond’ with such domestic champions as Julius Francis, the late James Oyebola, Rendall Munroe and Graham Earl - ‘they gave me some of my favourite nights in the ring’ - survived a heart attack five years ago.

Now, as this 61-year-old attempts to begin a new and very different life, more support is likely to be forthcoming from the tough world of boxing than Kellie Maloney might imagine at this moment of revelation.
