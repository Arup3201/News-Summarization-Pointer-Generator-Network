He is one of Britain's greatest minds, whose day job is to contemplate and explain the very deepest mysteries of the universe.

But by night it appears Professor Stephen Hawking is happy to take part in less intellectually challenging activities, having joined a group of men dressed as Bananaman on a stag do in Cambridge.

Groom Chris Hallam, 29, and nine of his closest friends had gone out in the city in fancy dress when they bumped into the celebrated academic.

Every time they eat a banana... Professor Stephen Hawking stopped for a picture with a gang of men dressed as Bananaman on a stag do in Cambridge

And they were stunned when the Brief History of Time author agreed to pose with them for a souvenir photo.

Father-of-one Chris is due to marry fiancée Kizzy Davis, 34, on March 29 and says he will never forget his night out.

The self-employed builder from Norwich, said: 'We only came across Professor Hawking because we were lost.

'We were just looking for a bar and spotted him getting out of his car.

'His son was with him and asking him "Should we ditch the meal and go out with these boys?"

'They could have just told us to carry on but they were all brilliant.

'It's been mad. People just keep saying "I can't believe it, is it really him?".'

It is not the first time Prof Hawking has got involved in activities linked to a stag do.

It emerged in 2012 the 72-year-old visited a swingers’ sex club in California and also stopped in at Stringfellows.

It was said that he arrived at the Freedom Acres club in Devore with an entourage of nurses and assistants 
before paying for young, naked dancers to perform privately for him.

A Cambridge University 
spokesman said at the time: ‘It is not true that Professor Hawking is a “regular” 
visitor to the club in question.

‘This report is greatly exaggerated. He visited once a few years ago with friends while on a visit to California.’

During his Stringfellows visit he happily posed for pictures with the club’s dancers.

Owner Peter Stringfellow even declared himself a fan of the professor.

He said: ‘I am often asked during interviews of all the people I have met, who I am most impressed with.

‘Of all the film stars I have met, the
 majority are really nice people, rock stars are a lot of fun and good 
company, some of the richest men in the world can be surprisingly funny,
 but when all is said and done Professor Hawking is The Man.

‘I remember asking him if he’d like to
 have a conversation with me about the universe or if he’d just like to 
watch the girls. The answer was quite simply, "The girls".

Powerful symbol: As one of Britain's most iconic symbols of human triumph over adversity, Prof Hawking, 72, has lived with the debilitating illness motor neurone disease since the age of 22

Genius: Stephen Hawking at his Oxford University graduation in 1962 - two years before his diagnosis with motor neurone disease

Professor Stephen Hawking, 72, has lived with debilitating motor neurone disease since the age of 22 but despite this cruel struggle he still became the world's most renowned astrophysicist.

He is a sufferer of the most common form of motor neurone fisease - amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - which has robbed him of almost all physical movement

He is an exceptional case, having survived for more than 40 years, despite doctors giving him just two years to live when first diagnosed.

In his incredible life his countless scientific papers, best-selling books and numerous 
awards have earned him comparisons with Albert Einstein and Sir Isaac 
Newton.

But he is as much a celebrity as he is a scientist,
 appearing on TV cartoon The Simpsons, starring in Star Trek and 
providing narration for a British Telecom commercial that was later 
sampled on a Pink Floyd album.

In the 1970s, already confined to a
 wheelchair, he produced a stream of first class research, including 
probably his most important contribution to cosmology.

This was the discovery of Hawking radiation, which allows a black hole to leak energy and gradually fade away to nothing.

By
 applying quantum mechanics to black holes, he had taken the first steps
 to combining quantum theory and general relativity. One describes the 
universe at the sub-atomic level, and the other at very large scales.

Bringing the two theories together is one of the great unfulfilled goals of modern physics.

In
 the 1980s, Prof Hawking and Professor Jim Hartle, from the University 
of California at Santa Barbara, proposed a model of the universe which 
had no boundaries in space or time.

The concept was described in A Brief History Of Time, which sold 25 million copies worldwide.

In
 recent years, Prof Hawking has examined the relationship between 
science and religion, writing a 2010 book, Grand Design, which argues 
that evoking God is not necessary to explain the origins of the 
universe.

He met the Pope at a scientific event hosted by the Pontifical
 Academy of Sciences in 2008.
