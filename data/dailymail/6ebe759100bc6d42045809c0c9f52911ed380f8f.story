Seventy six British schoolchildren and eight teachers have been left stranded at their hotel whilst on a history trip to the U.S. because of Hurricane Sandy.

The group, from St Martin’s Comprehensive in Caerphilly, South Wales, had arrived at JFK airport in New York on Saturday but only got to explore the city on Sunday before the bad weather arrived.

Since then they have been forced to remain at the Marriott Courtyard in Lyndhurst, New Jersey as the ‘Frankenstorm’ built up around them.

Their remaining plans to go to Philadelphia and Washington, from where they plan to fly home on Friday, are now up in the air.

The children are aged between 14 and 18 years of age but are coping well, said head of history Matthew Ferris, who is on the trip.

He said: ‘It’s a real shame for the children but we have to put safety first. ‘We have ordered in some pizza and they are making trips to the deli over the road where they serve those massive American style sandwiches.

‘The PE teacher who is with us has kindly offered to supervise them in the swimming pool and we have organised games of charades.

‘There’s a bit of Dunkirk spirit and the
kids know we are in the middle of a major storm, so they are being 
understanding even if they are disappointed.

‘With modern technology most of them have been able to get in touch with their parents over the Internet, or I’ve been emailing colleagues back home who have spoken to their relatives’.

Mr Ferris added that the children had been ‘badgering’ him for two years to organise the trip and that they had paid £1,000 each to come.

He said: ‘On Sunday we did get to see some of New York and went on a bus tour. We also walked around Times Square and went up the Empire State Building which I was really pleased about as we couldn't do that today'.
