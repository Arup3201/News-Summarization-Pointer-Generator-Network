The Austrian government is looking at ways to expropriate the house where Adolf Hitler spent his early childhood as it seeks to end a dispute with the owner over its use.

The move is the latest in efforts by the government to ensure that the house, in Beaunau, is not used in a way that makes it even more of a shrine for Hitler's admirers. The government has already made an offer to buy the house from the owner.

Municipal officials in Braunau have already complained that it draws neo-Nazi visitors to the town on the border with Germany.

Municipal officials in Braunau have already complained that it draws neo-Nazi visitors to the town on the border with Germany; the interior ministry has rented the house for years to prevent misuse, but it has remained empty for three years after the last tenants moved out

Interior ministry spokesman Karl-Heinz Grundboeck said his ministry expects expert opinions by the end of the month on expropriation if the owner - a woman authorities refuse to identify - turns down their offer to purchase it.

The interior ministry has rented the house for years to prevent its misuse, subletting it to various charitable organisations. But the building has stood empty since a workshop for the mentally disabled moved out more than three years ago.

Local officials say the owner vetoed plans to move in a new charity and a school late last year because she was opposed to renovations that would be required.

Alderman Harry Buchmayer said officials had 'tried very hard' to find a solution but the owner 'does not seem ready to co-operate'. 

Mr Grundboeck described expropriation as the 'last option', saying the government hoped the owner would agree to sell. She has reportedly turned down past offers.

Among prospective buyers over the past few years was a Russian parliamentarian who threatened to raze it - a plan doomed to fail as the Renaissance-era building is under historical protection.
