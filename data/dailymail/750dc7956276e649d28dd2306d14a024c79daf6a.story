Count on a pack of wily coyotes to help catch a sneaky criminal.

Daniel Rice, 21, was being held in an Iowa jail a week ago on charges of theft, burglary and criminal mischief when he was taken to a hospital in Muscatine to be treated for a heart condition.

During his stay at Trinity Muscatine hospital last Monday, Rice somehow managed to slip out of handcuffs and took off on foot wearing only a flimsy hospital gown, which he later lost.

Wanted man: Daniel Rice, 21, pictured left in his booking photo and right in a Facebook image, was arrested last week on theft, burglary and criminal mischief charges in Iowa, but was able to escape from custody 

Great escape: Rice slipped out of handcuffs while being treated for a heart condition at Trinity Muscatine hospital 

Wily coyotes: Two days after the escape, a 911 dispatcher in Illinois got a call from a man saying that he was being chased by 20-30 coyotes. Above is a file photo of the animals 

Busted: Rice was located October 22 in Loud Thunder Forest Preserve in Illinois, 8 miles away from Muscatine 

As sheriff's deputies in Muscatine, Iowa, were busy searching for the fugitive, officials in Illinois City, Illinois, located 8 miles away, got an unexpected call from a man saying that he was being chased by a large pack of wild coyotes, according to Muscatine Journal.  

The call was placed just after midnight on October 22 from Loud Thunder Forest Preserve by Rice, who gave the 911 dispatcher a false name, Zachary Turner, in a bid to conceal his identity, reported WQAD. 

On the 911 call, the fugitive said that he and another person were being pursued in the woods by 20-30 coyotes.

'I got a stick to defend ourselves,' the suspect told the 911 dispatcher.

Rock Island County Sheriff’s deputies responded to the nature preserve and found Rice, whom they quickly identified as the Iowa fugitive thanks to a pacemaker scar on his chest.

More legal troubles: In addition to his previous charges, the 21-year-old husband and father now faces one count of escape from custody 

The 21-year-old suspected thief was accompanied by his wife, Samantha May, reported KWQC. According to her Facebook page, the woman has three children, including a newborn baby.

Ever the fan of aliases, on social media Daniel Rice goes by the name Ethan D Leaver.  

Rice was taken into custody and is being held in the Muscatine County Jail on $50,000 cash bail. He is due back in court November 3.

In addition to his previous charges, the 21-year-old now faces a count of escape from custody.
