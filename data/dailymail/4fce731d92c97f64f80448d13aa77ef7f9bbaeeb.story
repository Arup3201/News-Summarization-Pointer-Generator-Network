Memories: Liv Stevens was a sixth former at Stowe School from 2006-2008

The motto at Stowe School, ‘persto et praesto – I persist and I excel’, was a source of inspiration for pupils when I attended. Especially when it came to having sex.

Teachers knew it was happening, but there wasn’t much they could do about it. Confined to the school grounds for weeks at a time with hormones raging, pupils were regularly having sex.

There was a game known as the Temple Challenge, where couples would compete to have sex at all  of the 40 tiny neo-classical buildings in the school’s 750 acres.

In one girls’ boarding house, a tally chart of locations where pupils had sex was updated regularly. 

Pupils had sex anywhere they could: in unlocked classrooms in the evenings, in the cricket pavilion, even outside boarding houses.

I never heard of anyone getting caught, but there were a few close calls.

Once a girl was forced to sneak out of a boy’s  bedroom window when the housemaster came knocking.

These rendezvous weren’t one-night stands, but part of loving relationships – and never underage as the school only accepts girls from 16.

Two old school friends are still going out with the boyfriends they met aged 16.

All the girls knew that the school’s medical centre, the San, stocked the morning-after pill. On at least one occasion I accompanied a friend to get one.

The school should be both open and realistic about sex and accept that it’s better to prepare, and offer pupils contraception if they need it.
