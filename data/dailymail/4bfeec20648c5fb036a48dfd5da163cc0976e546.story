A new treaty was agreed yesterday to protect sharks - including the porbeagle species which is native to British waters.

Five species of sharks and two manta rays were given protection under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites).

Governments voted earlier in the week in favour of the move to list the sharks and rays as species under the Cites treaty, which will mean the international trade in them is strictly regulated to ensure it is sustainable.

'Shark populations are in free fall, but have been thrown a lifeline today - Cites has finally listened to the scientists,' Ali Hood, director of conservation for the Shark Trust, said.

He added: 'This is a tremendous result, reflecting years of campaigning for trade controls for these high-value species.

'Now parties face the challenge of implementation, and we urge the EU to reach out and assist less-developed nations with capacity building and practical implementation.'

There were concerns that the final 
Cites meeting in Bangkok, Thailand, could reverse the decision but the 
move was confirmed yesterday.

Conservationists
say protection is necessary to reverse declining numbers of sharks and 
rays, which are being overfished for food and so-called Traditional 
Chinese Medicine, or TCM.

Almost 100 million sharks are caught 
every year, targeted largely for their fins for use in shark fin soup, 
which is a delicacy in Asia and especially in China, wildlife experts 
say.

Hunters hack the fins off live 
animals and then toss the creatures back into the ocean to drown. Many 
of China's richest citizens believe the soup has medicinal benefits and 
serve it at celebrations.

Each fin can fetch up to £380 ($600) a pound, with a single bowl of the prized soup fetching up to £108.

But as species which are slow-growing and slow to reproduce, the sharks are vulnerable to overfishing.

Manta rays have also seen numbers 
decline dramatically in some areas in the face of a growing trade in 
their gill plates, which are sold in China as medicine claimed to treat a
range of health complaints from asthma to chickenpox and even cancer.

Some
countries have been reluctant to include marine species, which can 
generate large revenues, in the treaty that regulates or bans 
international trade in wildlife. The shark fin business is worth an 
estimated £320 million a year.

UK fisheries minister Richard Benyon welcomed the move: 'I am extremely pleased to see that the Porbeagle, three Hammerheads, the Oceanic Whitetip sharks and the Manta rays have all received greater protection under Cites.

'The UK government has been leading calls for greater protection of sharks and I feel very strongly that trade in these vulnerable species must be regulated to ensure it is sustainable and so I welcome the positive step that Cites has taken.'

Until 2010, there was small fishing quota for porbeagle sharks in British and other European waters when commercial landings were banned due to overfishing.

The sharks were caught as bycatch rather than targeted. The decline of porbeagles in the North East Atlantic is worse than anywhere else in the world.

They can grow to more than 11.5 feet (3.5 metres) long and their prey is mainly fish such as mackerel, herring and pilchard.

A 10-feet long porbeagle hooked by two anglers off the Cornish coast last year is believed to be the biggest recorded in UK waters – they released it alive. 

A U.N. agency also warned yesterday shark populations in the Mediterranean and Black Sea 'have dropped dramatically' over the past two centuries because of overfishing.

A study released by the Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization says sharks in the Mediterranean have declined by more than 97 percent over the past 200 years and 'risk extinction if current fishing pressure continues.'

In the Black Sea, catches of the main shark species have declined by about half.
