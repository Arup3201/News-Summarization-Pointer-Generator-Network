Sam Burgess, who will switch codes to try to play for England in the rugby union World Cup next year, will get the chance to bow out of rugby league on a high after helping South Sydney reach Australia’s NRL Grand Final for the first time for 43 years.

The Rabbitohs came from 12-0 down to beat reigning champions Sydney Roosters 32-22 in front of a crowd of 52,592 in Sydney, where they will face either Canterbury Bulldogs or Penrith next Sunday.

It means Bath’s rugby union team will have to wait another week to get their hands on Burgess.

Burgess, who moved to the NRL from Bradford in 2009, was joined in the South Sydney team by brothers Tom and George.

The 25-year-old came out on top in the highly-anticipated battle with Roosters' Sonny Bill Williams, who is also switching codes after the Kiwi announced he would be returning to rugby union.

And there are high hopes for Burgess in union and he is expected to make an instant impact for England in the 15-man code.
