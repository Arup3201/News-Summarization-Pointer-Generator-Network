Marin Cilic's jubilant coach Goran Ivanisevic declared it was ‘justice’ after the world No 14 overwhelmed Roger Federer to make Monday night’s final of the US Open with a career-best performance.

The 25-year-old Croatian played outstandingly well and was a thoroughly deserved winner, but his success is nonetheless tinged with controversy.

In April last year he tested positive for the stimulant Nikethamide contained in some glucose tablets bought by his mother.

Final challenge: Cilic produced a fantastic performance to beat Roger Federer on Saturday

Deserved: Federer is one of the more outspoken players in regards to drugs, but he has absolved the Croat

He denied any wrongdoing and was given a nine-month ban, later reduced to four, as the Court of Arbitration for Sport accepted its ingestion was an accident.

Despite being outspoken on doping, Federer sportingly stated after his defeat that he believed Cilic — who has always enjoyed a good reputation in the game — is someone who was not guilty of being anything more than naive.

Yet CAS did not fully exonerate Cilic, and people outside tennis will again look at this sport and wonder how serious it is about tackling doping when bans are so short and careers continue so seamlessly after violations.

Naive: Cilic tested positive but his ban was reduced to four months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport

Opponent: Cilic will face Kei Nishikori of Japan in the US Open final on Monday in New York

Shortly before Cilic’s positive test, Serbian ex-top 20 player Victor Troicki declined to give a blood test after his match at the Monte Carlo Open. CAS reduced his ban from 18 months to one year and he is back playing.

His supporters such as Novak Djokovic peddled disgraceful slurs about the experienced doctor involved, and faced no sanction.

Both cases involved complex evidence but the emerging reality is their suspensions cannot be much of a deterrent to potential dopers in tennis. 

Use of doping is likely to be limited but it surely exists in the game, probably including at the highest level, and the sport needs to be ever vigilant.

It is a fine achievement by Cilic to make the final, and the sense of injustice over his ban may have motivated him. But there are still mixed signals here.
