It was a spoof video featuring a woman who seeks out sex with asbestos workers which was meant to be funny.

But unfortunately for manager Tim Pow, most of his colleagues at the Christchurch Earthquake (CERA) Recovery Authority failed to see the joke.

It probably did not help that his email arrived shortly after the New Zealand organisation were criticised for not treating asbestos management seriously during the city's reconstruction.

This video,  a spoof of a woman seeking to have sex with an asbestos removal worker, was sent to Earthquake Recovery Authority contractors in Christchurch, New Zealand

The woman says to her date that asbestos removal workers are braver than firemen or policemen because  'you know you're going to die of mesothelioma'

Nor did Mr Pow's quip ‘Now who said asbestos was not the game to be in' endear him to his colleagues.

New Zealand Demolition and Asbestos Association executive member Helina Stil said the email was 'pretty strange’.

'They think it's all funny and stuff like that, but actually it's not. It's detrimental to what we're trying to achieve as women, but it's also detrimental to the industry as a whole.

'Tim is a really, really nice guy but in this instance, the email was inappropriate.'

Ms Stil said she was concerned that the email also appeared to make light of the fact asbestos was a highly dangerous substance.

CERA residential red zone operations manager Tim Pow's message in the email with the video attached said: 'Now who said Asbestos was not the game to be in.'

‘I think it's actually very, very poor timing and very, very poor taste.'

The video entitled Aspestos Girl was sent to about 40 CERA contractors by Mr Pow, who works as a residential red zone operations manager.

It features a fictional woman who gets verbally and physically excited about being on date with an asbestos removal worker.

‘I kind of have a thing for asbestos removal workers,’ she said. ‘Some girls date firemen or policemen but you all are much braver because you know you’re going to die of mesothelioma.'

She continues: ’I'm just asking you to come back to my house, sniff some sealant and remove my asbestos - you know, have sex - before you die of mesothelioma’.

Mesothelioma is a rare fatal cancer of the lining of the lungs or abdominal cavity and can be caused by asbestos, a known carcinogen.

The video was sent to about 40 Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority contractors by the company's residential red zone operations manager Mr Pow

Mr Pow's email containing the video has been labelled 'very inappropriate' and 'very poor taste'

A Christchurch contractor, who did not want to be named, told stuff.co.nz that the video was ‘in very poor taste’ and had caused outrage among the recipients.

CERA chief executive Roger Sutton said the email intended to give people a laugh ‘but in reality it was just dumb,’ he said.

‘The content has caused offence to some, and to anyone that has been offended, I apologise on behalf of CERA.’

CERA was a strong supporter of women working in the rebuild, and about half of its senior leaders were women, along with 64 per cent of its fixed-term and seconded staff, he said.

The company also treated asbestos management ‘very seriously' and had strict requirements in place for contractors dealing with the substance at Crown-owned properties.

Mr Sutton said CERA would be reminding staff of its policies and expectations for the use of work email.

Christchurch has suffered a series of earthquakes with the most violent killing 181 people in February 2011.

Three years on, the rebuild of the city will take at least another five years as gaps are expected to keep appearing throughout the city business district.
