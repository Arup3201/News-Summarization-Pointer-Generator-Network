Two days after their historic win, the South Sydney Rabbitohs are showing no sign of slowing down their celebrations.

There has been non-stop parties at Sam Burgess' house, private parties at a Surry Hills hotel and now a possible forehead tattoo that appears to be making its rounds of the team.

A candid photo of player Adam Reynolds has been circulating social media, showing the 24-year-old with what appears to be a tattoo of the team's logo above his left eyebrow. 

The black and white image, posted by fellow team mate Tom Burgess, offered little explanation other than the caption: 'BUNNY LOVE #pride'.

As over 7,700 Instagram followers liked the photo and began speculating about the tattoo's authenticity, a second image was posted to Reynold's own account. 

Captioned simply 'we done it', the image showed the halfback arm in arm with Rabbitohs' captain John Sutton who sported a replica of the apparent tattoo.

Fans and critics of the team took to social media to share their opinion on the unconfirmed ink, with one Twitter user writing: 'Adam Reynolds… knows it's an eye 'brow', not eye 'burrow', right?!'.

Despite quips that Reynolds will struggle to find another team to sign him on for next year's season if the tattoo proves permanent, the footballer who grew up on Morehead Street near Redfern Oval, revealed just how much the community and his love for the team make him who he is.

'I started at Souths and I came back here ... it's where I belong,' Reynolds told the Sydney Morning Herald.

'Every kid who grows up in Redfern or Waterloo has a ball in their hand from a young age….Maybe it's just a result of the die-hard love this area has for rugby league – the passion.'

While Reynolds is due to come off contract at the end of 2015, his desire is to stay in red and green.

'We have put it off to concentrate on football, but I would like to get it sorted,' he said.

'I will leave that up to my manager. He has done a great job in the past and I'm sure he will again.

'It is a great club ... I would love to stay. You only have to see how the fans have reacted to what we have done.

'It has touched so many lives. The fans are great here. To give back to them means a lot.'

With Souths' victory celebrations in full swing, Reynolds' manager Steve Gillis said he would sit down with Rabbitohs' management over the next few weeks to nut out his client's future.

'There is no timeframe on it at the moment,' Gillis told AAP.

'We want to let the boys enjoy the celebration. They have their (end of season) ball coming up. We will let it runs its course.

'Then we will sit down with them in the next two to three weeks. The preference is to stay at the club, that is the plan, we will see how it goes.'

Reynolds said he still found it hard to believe he had won a premiership with Souths.

'It was on the bucket list. It is going to be a great week, I just want to enjoy it,' he said.
