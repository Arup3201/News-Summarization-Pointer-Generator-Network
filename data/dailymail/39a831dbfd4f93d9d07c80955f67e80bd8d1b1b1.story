A convicted paedophile is reportedly working in a toy shop and a legal loophole in child protection laws means he is not breaking any rules.

Stephen Maxwell Murray, who was convicted in 1991 in the Preston Magistrates Court on three counts of indecent assault and one of supplying liquor to a minor, has been working at the Melbourne store Animasia for at least four years, the Herald Sun reports.

He was sentenced to six months in prison in 1991.

He later worked in a comic store called The Crypt in Melbourne before he was allegedly sacked by owner Carmel Barbara due to public outcry about his hiring.

Ms Barbara continued to employ Murray after finding about his past conviction but said she wanted to ‘give him a chance,’ the Sunday Herald Sun reported in 2005.

He now works at Animasia In Carlton, in Melbourne’s north, where he reportedly sells Japanese anime-inspired toys and runs model workshops in the school holidays.

It is not illegal for Murray to work at the store because there are no laws that stop convicted paedophiles from working in shops with young customers.

When Daily Mail Australia called Animasia, the owner of the store did not wish to comment and said Murray was not there. 

Victorian Attorney General Martin Pakula told Daily Mail Australia: ‘Like any parent I'm extremely concerned at the prospect of this happening.’ Mr Pakula has asked the Department of Justice and Regulation to review the definition of child related employment under the Sex Offenders Registration Act.

He said the act ‘already includes commercial services and business activities, child photography, talent or beauty competitions - to ensure it covers relevant employment which involves contact with children that poses a threat to them.’

On a web forum called Gunpla Builders Australia a colleague of Murray's at the Animasia store posted in 2011: 'Animasia @ Grattan Street is finally online after 10,000 years of hiding under a rock! [sic].'

The shop describes itself as an 'Anime speciality store that specialises in Gundams and Mecha'

The worker added: 'Just FYI...Steven still won't participate with the internet revolution because he's still busy playing with his Godzilla and Mothra figures...LOL...However, rest assured that this thread has been officially endorsed and approved by Steven himself.'

The shop describes itself as an 'Anime speciality store that specialises in Gundams and Mecha.' 

In Victoria, legislation called the Working With Children Check attempts to help protect children from physical and sexual harm by screening people’s criminal records and professional conduct.

Those deemed to pose an ‘unjustifiable risk to children from working with or caring for them’ are banned from child-related work.

The Working with Children Act 2005 defines who needs a check and it is an organisations responsibility to determine which of their workers need it and to ensure their checks are valid.

Victorian Attorney General Martin Pakula told Daily Mail Australia: 'Like any parent I'm extremely concerned at the prospect of this happening'

The Act defines ‘direct contact’ with a child as involving ‘physical contact; or face to face oral communication; or physically being within eyeshot.’

However, the WWC Check does not assess a person’s suitability to work with or care for children in a particular role.

‘It is the responsibility of organisations to assess if a worker is suitable to work with children and continue monitoring their behaviour around children,’ the Victorian government’s Working With Children website said.

‘Organisations should be vigilant at all times by doing thorough reference checks and establishing sound, ongoing supervision practices so that children are safe from harm.’ 

The Sex Offenders Registration Act - which captures all persons convicted of a relevant sexual offences against children - prohibits registrants from working in child related employment (whether employed, volunteering, an officer of a body corporate or a member of a partnership) but not retail stores that young people may visit.

The penalty for a registrant working in such child related employment is two years imprisonment.
