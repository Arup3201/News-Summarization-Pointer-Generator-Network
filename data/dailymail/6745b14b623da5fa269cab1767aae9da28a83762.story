A soon-to-be-launched logo will tell discerning shoppers if the products they are buying from Walmart were made by women.

The stamp, which is designed to resemble a ring of women with their arms around each other, was developed by two nonprofits and Walmart, which will begin selling goods branded with the logo starting in September.

Maggie's Salsa, which is owned by Maria Magdalena De La Cruz Cook-Garcia, lingerie brand Smart & Sexy and cleaning agent CLR are just some of the companies that will be represented in this new scheme.

The initiative was inspired by recent research from Walmart which found that 90per cent of female shoppers specifically seek out products from women-owned businesses.

Pamela Prince-Eason, chief executive of Women's Business Enterprise National Council, which helped developed the logo, told Bloomberg Businessweek that she expects it to fit shoppers' needs.

'People are looking for reasons to feel good about the company they're buying from,' she explained, comparing it to similar logos that indicate Kosher or Fair Trade products.

She added in a Today interview that 18- to 34-year-olds are particularly likely to buy a product based on who made it.

'This is a group that cares very much about causes,' she explained. 'They tend to make consumer decision on just wanting to be supportive of women-owned businesses as much as they will on quality.'

Businesses need to be 51per cent owned or run by women and approved by Ms Prince-Eason's group as well as WEConnect International before they can use the logo.

The move is part of Walmart's 2011 promise to source $20billion of goods from women-owned businesses by 2016.

Ms Prince-Eason said that while Walmart is the first store to back the initiative, she is also in talks with several other retailers including Macy's and Office Depot.
