Colombia talisman James Rodriguez believes that his side are ready to conquer host nation Brazil in the quarter-finals of the World Cup.

Rodriguez struck twice on Saturday evening in the 2-0 win over Uruguay to become the competition’s leading scorer with five goals in four games, moving ahead of Lionel Messi and Neymar in the race for the Golden Boot.

The 22-year-old, who scored one the goals of the tournament with a sensational volley against the Uruguayans, has helped this vibrant and fast-paced Colombia side take the world by storm, with Jose Pekerman’s team enjoying their best ever Wold Cup campaign.

The Colombian’s reached the round of 16 in 1990 but have never before progressed into the quarter-finals of the competition.

Monaco playmaker Rodriguez said: ‘We're very happy because we are making history. As a younger man, I always wanted to be here. That was a great dream of mine and we hope that we can make it far.

‘It is a dream and we are making history and we want to do even more because this is a team that wants to win a lot.’

Colombia will meet Brazil on Friday evening in Forteleza and Colombia, who have won every game at the World Cup so far, feel that they have nothing to fear with all the expectation on the host nation.

‘There is no pressure,’ Rodriguez added, ‘Obviously they have their good players, they play well but I believe they must also follow us closely.’

‘We have good players and we can be dangerous, so this is going to be a beautiful match. It will be something extraordinary for us to play.’

Colombia emerged through Group C with a flawless record after victories over the Ivory Coast, Greece and Japan and they have now scored thirteen goals in Brazil and conceded just twice.
