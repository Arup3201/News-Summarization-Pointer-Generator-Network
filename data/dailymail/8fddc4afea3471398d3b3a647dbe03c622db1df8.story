The final touches are just about done for one of the biggest nights in British boxing on November 22, when Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew's rematch will headline a huge show at the Echo Arena in Liverpool.

There have been setbacks but everything is now agreed and they are ready to go at each other again. I can also confirm that it will be an eliminator for the world cruiserweight title and currently we almost have a pick of the belts to go for.

My best bet would be that the winner fights Marco Huck for the WBO title, but in reality I think the loser will also get a world-title shot. Frankly, this is the highest-profile fight in the whole division, a real grudge match, and the impression I get from my conversations is that all the title holders will want a piece of these two going forward.

The card will be on Sky Box Office and I must say I am proud to announce here the incredible line up we have. Scott Quigg will defend his WBA world super bantamweight title and we are in negotiations witg Joseph Agbeko, a two-time world champion, and also highly-ranked Shingo Wake. This would be the biggest test of Quigg's career and he has too much on the horizon for a slip up.

We have begun initial talks with the McGuigans over the fight everyone wants to see – Quigg v Carl Frampton. Frampton has an injury at the moment and I wouldn't expect him to fight again until February or March so we wanted to get Quigg out in the meantime. I'm confident the fight with Frampton is going to happen next year.

Also on the bill, I have James DeGale looking to impress ahead of his mandatory shot against Carl Froch next year. We have agreed terms with his opponent, it's a real fight - and we will announce the fight as soon as the contracts are signed.

The Liverpool card will also include WBA world bantamweight champion Jamie McDonnell against Walberto Ramos with the winner facing a unification bout with WBO champion Tomoki Kameda after we agreed a deal last week.

Then, of course, there's Anthony Joshua. He will fight Michael Sprott in an eliminator for the British title after fighting first on October 11 against Denis Bakhtov for the WBC international heavyweight title. The October 11 show at the O2 Arena will be Joshua's first title fight ahead of a world title shot by the end of 2015. I can't tell you how excited I am by this guy. The stabilisers are off and now we are picking up serious speed.

Also on the Liverpool show, there will be an outing for the incredible and unbeaten Callum Smith and his brother Stephen. Callum will face a huge step up against Montenegrin star Nikola Sjekloca (27-2) whose only defeats have come via points losses to Sakio Bika and recently Arthur Abraham for the WBO world title. The bout has been approved by the WBC as an official eliminator with the winner moving into a final eliminator in 2015. It's a massive statement fight for Callum - he is ready!

I can't help thinking that this will be the highest quality card in this country in years with plenty more still to come.

I'd like to say a few words about Paul Smith, who travelled to Germany last weekend and lost his world title challenge on points to Arthur Abraham. I am sickened by the scorecards that were produced in Kiel.

Everyone knows that if you fight away then it is unlikely you will get the verdict from a tight fight. And this was a very tight fight, so I knew what we were up against when I climbed in the ring at the end of the fight.

Paul Smith gave a good account of himself against Arthur Abraham and many have questioned the result

The judges voted unanimously in favour of Abraham, much to Smith's frustration and disappointment 

But to hear the three judges gives Abraham, a great champion, the verdict by such wide margins was a disgrace. It was inept judging at its worse.

We have made an official petition to the WBO and they will review the footage and I cannot see any other option than to make Paul the mandatory challenger for the title and order an immediate rematch.

I'd also like to see greater scrutiny placed on judges in terms of a greater test of their knowledge of the sport. These people have livelihoods and dreams in their hands and cannot be allowed to make such terrible decisions.

I've been talking in detail with Wembley and they are very keen for us to come back with another show after the success of Froch-Groves. I can reveal here that I have pencilled in June 27 and July 4 and will likely hold a show on one of those dates.

It could be Carl Froch, possibly against James DeGale, and Kell Brook versus Amir Khan would fill it. Kell will probably make his comeback in March and would then be ready for a huge summer fight. Watch this space.

I've got a show in Leeds on October 4 and it could potentially place two top British fighters on a collision course. We have Josh Warrington, a great young fighter who at 23 already has the British and Commonwealth featherweight title. On Saturday he fights Davide Dieli for the European belt at the First Direct Arena.

Josh is the biggest individual ticket seller in the country. He sells 2,000 himself, through his own phone, more or less. Then he often delivers them by hand.

The European title was vacated by Welshman Lee Selby, who fights Joel Brunker in an IBF world title eliminator on the October 11 bill in London. The idea of Selby and Warrington fighting in the future appeals to me.

The Leeds card will also see Brian Rose return after his world title challenge, and Ricky Burns fights at light-welterweight against Alexnadre Lepelley. Expect one of the best atmospheres you've seen on Saturday - the Leeds fans are ready to blow the roof off. There's a lot to look forward to at the moment.
