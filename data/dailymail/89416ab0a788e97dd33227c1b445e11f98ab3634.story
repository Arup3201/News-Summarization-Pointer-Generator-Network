A supercar has become the world's fastest production model after reaching a top speed of 270mph. 

American firm Hennessey has claimed for some time that its Venom GT is the fastest thing on four wheels.

But until now the firm hadn't been able to attempt beating the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport's record-breaking 269mph because it was on VW's private test track.

However, it emerged today that the Texan manufacturer was given access to Nasa's space shuttle landing runway in Florida for a one-off blitz in the 1,200bhp machine.

The Venom GT managed to reach 270.49mph compared to the average top speed of 200mph in a Formula 1 car.

The speed makes it slightly quicker than the 269.86mph achieved by Bugatti in 2010. 

The record was revealed to TopGear.com, with test pilot Brian Smith telling the website that the car was capable of going even faster.

He said: 'At the very top end, there was a little wandering, but hey, we're going 270mph.

Pilot Brian Smith said he could get another 5-10mph out of the Venom GT (pictured), but the runway in Florida was just 3.22 miles long

The £800,000 Hennessey Venom GT is powered by a twin-turbocharged, 7-litre V8 engine which develops a whopping 1,244bhp.

This gives it a 0-62mph time of just 2.7 seconds. In Florida, it went from 20mph to 120mph in 7.71 seconds.

Since
 its launch in 2011, it has been praised by the motoring press while 
Steve Tyler, from Aerosmith, is among the 11 people to take delivery so 
far.

'It was still pulling. If we could run on an eight-mile oval, we could go faster than that.'

Bugatti, meanwhile, can make use of Volkswagen's Ehra-Lessien test track which has a straight of 5.5 miles.

Despite the jaw-dropping top speed - 
which is almost four times the UK motorway and three times the highest US highway speed limit - the Venom GT 
won't be entering next year's Guinness World Record book.

They
 only took the car on one run, and for a record to stand, the driver must perform two runs.

Nasa would only allow the one run so, for now, the 
Veyron Super Sport retains the official top spot.

Romans International, the high end sports car dealership in Surrey, sold the UK's only Venom GT last year.
