For travellers with a taste for the high life, it’s the ultimate luxury holiday.

A high-end travel company has launched a 22-day round-the-world trip, where guests stay in five-star hotels and fly each route by private jet.

The trip, which departs London in March 2015, sees travellers visit Mexico, Brazil, Easter Island, Tahiti, Australia, Cambodia, India and Tanzania – but it will only suit those with a lot of spare cash.

Whirlwind trip: The 22-day round--the-world tour includes a stop off in Sydney to see the Opera House

Luxury flights: The 22-day trip, which costs up to nearly £39,000, includes transport on a private jet

An epic journey to circumnavigate the globe, the Captain’s Choice Tour will cost guests £34,850 per person for those sharing a twin room throughout the trip, or £38,780 for anyone travelling solo. It works out at about £1,500 per day.

The price includes all travel and transfers, luxury accommodation, sightseeing trips, all meals, wine and beers, all tipping and taxes, travel insurance, dedicated flight crew and tour doctor, as well as special luggage handling and custom arrangements.

Flights will be on board a customised Boeing 767 that holds just 92 guests and boasts spacious, leather VIP seats.  

Travellers will enjoy gourmet meals, ‘copious quantities’ of champagne and fine wines throughout their flights.

The route: The 22-day trip departs from London, flying to Mexico, Brazil, Easter Island, Tahiti, Australia, Cambodia, India and Tanzania

Captain’s Choice said was launching the flight to mark 91 years on from the first successful circumnavigation of the globe by air that was completed in 1924 and took took 175 days.  

The tour departs from the Harrods private jet terminal at Luton Airport on March 5, 2015, with the first port of call Chichen Itza in Mexico – filled with ancient wonders from the Mayans and Aztecs.

The journey continues southwards to Brazil, and Rio de Janeiro, host city of the World Cup and 2016 Olympics, with a stay at the famous Copacabana Palace Hotel, which overlooks the shores of Copacabana beach. 

Other hotels include the Fiesta Americana in Mexico; Hangaroa Eco Villa in Easter Island; Hilton Moorea Lagoon in Tahiti; Four Seasons in Bora Bora; Four Seasons in Sydney; and Raffles Grand Hotel in Cambodia.

Guests can visit one of the world’s great waterfalls, Iguassu, before travelling on to remote Easter Island with its mystical Moai statues. 

Once-in-a-lifetime trip: Jetsetters will stop off in Easter Island as part of the epic journey

Wildlife spotting: Holidaymakers will have the chance to see giraffes in Tanzania

On board luxuries: Jetsetters will be served 'copious' amounts of champagne during all flights

The pace slows with a two-night stay at Moorea in Tahiti in stunning overwater bungalows on the edge of pristine beaches. 

A landmark point in the journey is reached as the tour crosses the International Date Line en route to Sydney, for a three-night stay. 

From here the tour heads to Cambodia for a visit to the remarkable ruins at Angkor Wat, the largest Hindu temple and religious monument in the world. 

Hot on the heels of this is the breathtaking Taj Mahal in Agra in India where guests will stay 660 metres away at the Oberoi Amarvilas.

Stunning scenery: The trip also includes tour guides for some of the world's most famous sights - including Angkor Wat in Cambodia

Eastern wonder: The 22-day round-the-world trip stops off in India, with a visit to the Taj Mahal

The final stop on the tour, prior to completing the circumnavigation in London, is Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, the starting point for a safari into the Serengeti and the opportunity for game spotting.

Katie Panagou, Manager UK for Captains Choice, said: ‘This tour will be groundbreaking, even by the standard set by the concept of private jet touring. 

‘The logistics involved in creating an itinerary of this nature, such as keeping all flights to daytime, thus ensuring everyone always has a good night’s sleep, maximising touring experiences and including all the highlights, serving gourmet regional food throughout and booking the best available hotels with seamless transfers and short-circuiting the official channels are almost beyond comprehension. 

‘They take years of experience and knowledge to engineer, but the real beauty of it is that our guests will have absolutely no idea of what goes on behind the scenes, either before or during the trip.’
