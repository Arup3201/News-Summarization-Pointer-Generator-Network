Less than 24 hours after details of their tour to New Zealand were announced, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been plunged into a diplomatic row.

It centres on a planned visit to pay their respects to the king of the Maoris, Tuheitia Paki, at Turangawaewae Marae – his people's sacred  place – during a visit to the country's North Island.

But yesterday it emerged that the visit had been called off after the king made it clear he was offended that the couple could spare only 90 minutes out of their schedule.

Snubbed: Kate and Prince George are on a 10-day stay in New Zealand

According to sources, the long list of demands around the visit and tight timeframe would have broken proper protocol on the marae.

So the king told both the New Zealand government and Kensington Palace that the visit was off.  Now William and Kate, who will still travel to nearby Hamilton, no longer have a specific meeting with any Maori leader outside of the usual 'traditional  welcomes' they will receive during their ten-day stay in New Zealand, their first tour with Prince George, which begins on April 7.

The meeting was important because not only was it seen as a mark of respect to the indigenous community, but William and Kate would have been following in the footsteps of the Queen and Prince Philip who made the same detour on their visit to New Zealand in 1953.

Locals had been planning the couple's itinerary for weeks, saying they were looking forward to welcoming the young royals to the 'heart of the kingitanga', the Maori monarchy.

The ensuing furore has forced New Zealand prime minister John Key to make a statement. 'I think it's a shame the couple aren't going, but it's a decision made solely by King Tuheitia's people,' he said.

'My understanding was the palace [Kensington Palace] offered King Tuheitia's people an opportunity for the prince to visit.

'They were offered a 90-minute slot, that was longer than pretty much any other engagement that they have, and King Tuheitia's people decided that wasn't long enough and on that basis they rejected him attending.'

He added: 'He [Prince William] has a pretty tight timetable [and] 90 minutes by the time you also travel there and back and have to fit in a number of other things, was, I would have thought, quite generous.'

Tuheitia Paki, 55, came to the throne in 2006 after the death of his mother, queen Te Atairangikaahu.

Maori academic Professor Rawiri Taonui said the cancelled meeting was a snub that needed to be smoothed over.

'It's an awkward, clumsy and glaring oversight,' he said. 'The king may have over-reached in terms of the time that he's looking for, but ultimately I think it's the government's responsibility.'

Kensington Palace said there would be numerous chances to meet members of the Maori community at the many traditional welcomes the couple will receive.
