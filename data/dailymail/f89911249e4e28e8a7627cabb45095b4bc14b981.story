England practised penalties at the end of yesterday’s session as they prepare for the possibility of a shootout after the group stages — but this time they did it without a keeper.

Although it is by no means certain that England will get through a group involving Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica, Hodgson is preparing for every eventually.

But it is the decision to practise without a goalkeeper and instead ask the players to direct shots through various hoops that is of most interest.

Redundant: England goalkeepers Fraser Forster, Ben Foster and Joe Hart have not been used for penalty practise in training

Relaxed: Roy Hodgson is relatively calm about the whole penalty shootout business

Hodgson added: ‘It’s more for the fun of it at the moment, but I don’t think practising penalties every day for the next two or three weeks until the group stage is over is going to make a vast deal of difference.

‘We haven’t got down to thinking who the five will be.

‘But it’s not a difficult decision when the time comes because we know who the penalty takers are. We know who takes penalties for their clubs It’s an easy thing to do.

‘You don’t need three weeks of preparation for that.’

Beaten away: David Batty sees his penalty saved by Argentina goalkeeper Carlos Road in the last 16 in France '98

Agonizing: Jamie Carragher sees his penalty go wide during the quarter-final shootout against Portugal in 2006

Captain Steven Gerrard, vice-captain Frank Lampard, Rickie Lambert, Leighton Baines and Wayne Rooney are the likely first five if they are still on the pitch after 120 minutes.

England have gone out of the World Cup three times on penalties, losing to West Germany in 1990, Argentina in 1998 and Portugal in 2006.

They have also been eliminated from the European Championship the same way three times, losing on penalties to Germany in 1996, Portugal in 2004 and Italy in 2012.

The only shootout they have won was their first, against Spain in the quarter-finals of Euro 96.
