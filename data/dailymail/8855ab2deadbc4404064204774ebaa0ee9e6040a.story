A heartbroken girlfriend took her own life four months after her boyfriend drowned while the pair were on a round the world trip together, an inquest has ruled.

Kate Downey, 30, was found dead in a room at Newcastle International Airport’s Premier Inn on March 15, just months after boyfriend John-Paul Conley drowned while the pair were on holiday.

An inquest into Miss Downey’s death at Newcastle Coroner’s Court has ruled she died as a result of suffocation. The coroner concluded she committed suicide and intended to take her own life.

An inquest has ruled that Kate Downey, 30, committed suicide in a room at Newcastle International Airport's Premier Inn four months after boyfriend John-Paul Conley drowned while the pair were on holiday

Archeologist Miss Downey and Mr Conley, a docker at Teesside docks, had both taken a year out from their jobs in order to go travelling.

The pair had been in Laos, in south-east Asia, for just a few days when Mr Conley was swept away while swimming in a river on the island of Don Khone.

Rescue workers launched a search operation for 35-year-old from Linthorpe, Middlesbrough, aided by £30,000 raised by his family back home to pay for boats and helicopters.

After four days his body was found washed up on one of the beaches further downriver.

Speaking at the time, Miss Downey’s brother Lee, 35, said his sister 'was understandably devastated.'

Hundreds of tributes flooded in for Miss Downey, a former Nunthorpe School pupil, when the news of her death spread.

'Hope you have found your Shangri-La, having the next great adventure with Jonny. RIP our beautiful sister xxx,' her brother said.

Many other tributes were also paid on Facebook, with one person saying: 'Such another tragic loss for the families and friends of them both. Thoughts and prayers to you all and may they both now rest in peace together.'

Another wrote: 'When two people are in love and do so many things together they have a few sad times but so so many happy times.

'If they are parted through tragedy the one left living can feel so much pain inside we all can’t see as tears will hide.

'If they feel that they can’t go on we can’t imagine the pain of there broken heart only that they need to be together once again.'

The inquest was held last Thursday.
