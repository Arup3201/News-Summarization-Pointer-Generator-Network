A 53-year-old Alabama man said he killed his 34-year-old wife and her pet parrot because he was annoyed with their banter.

Robin Penton attempted suicide March 10 after shooting dead his wife Collen Penton and their three dogs at their Huntsville home.  The exotic bird's neck was snapped.

In a suicide note written after killing Colleen, Penton wrote that he killed the dogs (a pointer, chihuahua and Rottweiler) because his wife didn't train them. He said that he killed Colleen and the bird because they both 'talked too much'.

Behind bars: Robin Penton, 53, appeared in court on Wednesday after allegedly murdering his wife March 10

Penton survived the suicide attempt after police arrived on the scene and paramedics rushed him off to the hospital.

He was in court on Wednesday as investigators recounted what they found at the crime scene.

Authorities were tipped off about the shooting when Penton called his brother to say he had just shot his wife and planned to commit suicide as well.

Penton's brother then called police, who showed up at the scene and found two banged-up motorcycles in the garage.

They followed a blood trail into the bathroom where they found Colleen's body face-up on the floor, her shirt off, and dead of an apparent head wound.

Investigators say she had been shot three times and suffered a fractured skull after being hit over the head with a kerosene heater.

Her body had been decorated by Penton after her death, with a make-shift tribute of flowers and a ceramic angel figurine.

Penton later told police that he took the flowers from his mother's grave.

Police also found Penton in the bathroom, having passed out after washing down some hydrocodone with rum.

He was rushed off to the hospital where doctors were able to revive him. Authorities say he probably would have died had they not immediately gotten help.

Penton explained his violent act in suicide notes left behind at the home.

He said there was so much blood because he cut Colleen's nose. He said he beat her and then dragged her into the bathroom where he shot her as well as the dogs.

In the notes, he also threatened his former boss who laid him off as well as Colleen's ex-husband and his step children, Colleen's biological children.

He partially apologized for his behavior, saying Colleen 'didn't deserve this, but she wanted it'.

After Pender was discharged from the hospital, he elaborated to police that he snapped when he read a text message Colleen wrote to a friend that day, complaining that her husband had only been home for a few minutes and was 'already talking crap'.

While police say he cried and confessed to killing his wife, he showed no remorse and promised to follow through on his other threats.

He says he messed up the motorbikes to get back at his former boss, who sits on the board of the bank used to take out a loan to purchase them.

A friend and former co-worker were called to the stand on Wednesday to testify for Penton, and said he never showed signs of aggression or even complained about his wife or boss in the past.

The defense was trying to get bond lowered from $500,000, but the judge denied that request.

It was revealed Wednesday that Penton served time in prison in the 80s for rape, sodomy, assault and indecent exposure.

He also told police that he beat Colleen in the past, but not often because he didn't like to go it.
