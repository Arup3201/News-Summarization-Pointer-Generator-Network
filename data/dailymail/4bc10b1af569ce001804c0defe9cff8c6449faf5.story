Schalke have been given a boost with news that striker Klaas Jan-Huntelaar hasn't broken his leg as first feared - following their Champions League first leg last 16 2-0 defeat against Real Madrid.

Huntelaar was forced off injured after a clash with Real defender Raphael Varane during the first-half encounter on Wednesday night in Gelsenkirchen.

The 31-year-old was rushed to hospital amid concerns that he had fractured his right fibula but scans revealed that he has in fact suffered a severe bruise to his lower leg.

'Lower-leg injury for @KJ_Huntelaar. A more exact diagnosis to follow after further examination in hospital. #S04RMA,' Schalke's official Twitter account wrote at first.

However, Dutch journalist Stefan Coerts later tweeted: '#Huntelaar injury update: #Schalke's Dutchman has suffered a severe bruise to lower leg. No fractured fibula as initially feared.'

Huntelaar, who had returned to the side after missing three games through a domestic suspension, declared himself fully-fit and ready for action ahead of Schalke's clash.

'I am eager to play,' he told reporters on Tuesday. 'I can finally play again on Wednesday and I am happy about that.

'We simply gave away our last home game against Real (last season). We need to tackle this game better this time,' he added.

The hosts were already down 1-0 before the Dutchman's withdrawal on 32 minutes through Real superstar Cristiano Ronaldo's strike.

Things got worse for the Bundesliga side in the second half when defender Marcelo rocketed in their second with a brilliant solo effort on 78 minutes.

Schalke face the uphill task of turning around their two-goal deficit when they travel to the Santiago Bernabeu on March 10.
