Police have launched a criminal investigation into the death of a nine-day-old baby who contracted an infection from a suspected contaminated drip.

Officers from the Metropolitan Police's Homicide and Major Crime Command are investigating the death of Yousef Al-Kharboush, who died in the neonatal intensive care unit at St Thomas' Hospital, south London, on June 1.

They are also 'investigating the circumstances' of a second baby who died at the same hospital ten days later. Detectives from Cambridgeshire are investigating a third baby death.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said it was focussing on the production of the intravenous feeds and not the NHS trusts which run the hospitals where the babies died.

The families of the babies involved have been notified, the spokesman added. 

The source of the infection was allegedly linked to an outbreak which is believed to have been caused by a batch of intravenous liquid called total parental nutrition (TPN).

The feeds, manufactured by ITH Pharma in north west London, are designed to be given to babies born prematurely who are too weak to eat on their own. 

It is thought they were given to babies in intensive care units in 11 hospitals across England.

During the outbreak, there were 19 confirmed cases of babies developing sepsis, from which three babies died.

The outbreaks occurred at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, The Whittington Hospital, Brighton & Sussex University Hospital NHS Trust, Addenbrookes, Luton and Dunstable University Hospital, Peterborough City Hospital, Southend University Hospital, Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Basildon University Hospital, and Harley Street Clinic.  

The Met Police spokesman said: 'Officers from the Metropolitan Police Service's Homicide and Major Crime Command launched a criminal investigation following the death of a baby at a London hospital in June 2014.

Detectives from Cambridgeshire are investigating a third baby death, which took place at the Rosie Hospital in Cambridge, on the same site as Addenbrooke's (pictured)

'Following discussion with the Crown Prosecution Service, we are investigating the circumstances of a second baby at the same hospital.

'The deaths took place of 'baby A' on Sunday, 1 June and 'baby B' on Tuesday, 10 June at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust.

'Officers have also been liaising with colleagues in Cambridgeshire Constabulary about a third baby who also died in similar circumstances at the Rosie Maternity Hospital, part of Cambridge University Hospitals.

'The families have been notified of this investigation by the forces concerned.

'The current focus of this investigation is on the production of intravenous feeds. We are not investigating the health trusts.

'The MPS is working with a number of agencies to progress matters.

'We are aware of a small number of other babies who received this feed and are working with relevant agencies to speak to those families.'

A spokesman for ITH Pharma said: 'ITH Pharma is aware of a police investigation and will fully co-operate as and when required.

'There has never been, nor should there be any suggestion of intentional wrongdoing by ITH Pharma or its employees. We understand it is normal practice for the police to investigate such circumstances and it would be inappropriate for us to make any further comment during the investigation.'

The investigation came after Public Health England (PHE) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) completed their investigation into the outbreak of the infection, called Bacillus cereus.
