A controversial plan which would have forced the unemployed to apply for at least 40 jobs a month before being granted the Newstart Allowance has been scrapped.

The backdown on a key plank of the Federal Government's welfare benefits reform has come about after a stream of negative feedback.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott, however, is defending his government's about-face, insisting he's 'fair dinkum' when it comes to listening to feedback.

The government's proposal to double the job application target for Newstart Allowance recipients was widely criticised as punitive for job seekers and an administrative nightmare for businesses.

The status quo of 20 applications will remain.

The Prime Minister conceded the government had made some significant 'refinements' to the practicalities of the policy.

'The only fair dinkum consultations are (ones) that can and do result in some refinements and where necessary some changes,' Mr Abbott said.

'I would like to say isn't this the whole point of consultation? Consultation that can't result in any changes is meaningless.

'The consultations that this government has will be fair dinkum.'

Employment Minister Eric Abetz said the government had acknowledged the policy would have put a burden on business and possibly diminish the value of job applications.

At the same time, he maintained it should be the full-time job of the unemployed to gain employment and believes the 40 job application target would not have been too onerous. He has previously stated that seeking one job in the morning and another in the afternoon was 'not too hard'.

Greens Leader Christine Milne said she was pleased the government had backed down. 

She says the next step is for the government to abandon plans to force those under the age of 30 to wait six months before they can claim the dole.

That program is set to come into vogue in January 2015.

St Vincent de Paul Society CEO, Dr John Falzon, is also urging the government to rethink its plans.

'What we had hoped for was a jobs plan, what we have got instead is a bashing the young unemployed plan.'

The Greens have also called on the government to abandon plans to force those under the age of 30 to wait six months before they can claim the dole

The government also plans to extend the work for the dole program. Those under 30 will have to complete 25 hours a week of the program. Older job seekers between age 30 and 50 will have to complete 15 hour

He said the government has missed the point and the labour market structure is the problem, not those seeking work.

'You don't help young help people into work by forcing them to live below the poverty line and you certainly don't help them into a job by forcing them to rely on charity to survive,' Dr Falzon added.
