The BBC's director of news is understood to have reprimanded Newsnight host Jeremy Paxman over negative slurs he made about the corporation, before he announced his departure from the show.

The presenter branded the corporation 'smug' and complained that the station Radio 1Xtra being played in the lifts was 'hell', during an interview last month.

Sources told the Guardian, James Harding sent a note to Paxman condemning his public criticism of the BBC.

Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman is understood to have received a note from bosses reprimanding over negative comments he made about the BBC, shortly before announcing his departure from the show

They claim Mr Harding said Paxman's comments were 'disloyal' and prompted the University Challenge presenter to reply, denying the accusation and pointing out his long service at the corporation.

It comes after Ben Cooper, the controller of Radio 1Xtra addressed Paxman's dislike of his station's work, sending an email telling him to 'take the stairs' if he did not enjoy the lift entertainment.

A BBC spokeswoman told MailOnline the corporation does not comment on internal issues.

Paxman decided to step down from the position he has held for 25 years, last summer.

He informed the BBC's director general Tony Hall and Mr Harding at the time, but agreed to stay on to help the team after the appointment of a new editor following a difficult period for the show.

The BBC confirmed Paxman will continue to present University Challenge following his last stint hosting Newsnight in June.

Speaking earlier this week when Paxman's departure was announced, Mr Harding, 44, who previously edited The Times, said he had 
become the 'great lion of BBC journalism' and would be sorely missed. 

James Harding, the BBC's director of news, is said to have cracked down after Paxman said in an interview that the corporation was 'smug'. Mr Harding reportedly claimed the comment was 'disloyal', a claim Paxman is said to have denied, pointing out his long service to the BBC in his reply

He said: 'Jeremy has led from the front: 
fearless, aggressive and persistent.

'He never failed to ask the 
difficult questions and always refused to accept glib or deceptive 
answers.

'Of course we will miss him but he has set standards for our 
journalism that the rest of us must follow.

'We
 accept his decision to move on but I think it is fair to say that the 
only people really celebrating his decision will be the politicians and 
public figures he has so often and so brilliantly held to account.'

It is said that rival broadcasters, including Channel 4 have privately expressed an interest in working with Paxman on future projects.

It is not yet known who will replace him when he leaves Newsnight in June.

Paxman decided to leave Newsnight last summer, but agreed to stay on to help the show through a period of transition as a new editor joined the team. He is set to leave the show after 25 years, in June

James Harding was the former editor of The Times newspaper before he became head of BBC News last year.

Mr Harding, 44, was the youngest person to become editor of The Times when he was appointed in December 2007, aged 38.

He had previously worked at the Financial Times.

He worked at The Times for five years before resigning in December 2012.

It was announced in April 2013 that Mr Harding would become head of BBC News and in August last year he officially started in the role.

Since taking on the position, which was formerly held by Helen Boaden, Mr Harding has spoken of a desire to double BBC News’ worldwide audience which currently stands at around 250million.
