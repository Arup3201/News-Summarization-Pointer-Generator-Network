Liverpool legend and Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher has launched a scathing attack on Arsenal defender and World Cup-winner Per Mertesacker.

The German centre half looked short on form and confidence as the Gunners lost 3-2 to Stoke at the Britannia Stadium, and Carragher believes Mertesacker let his team-mates, and in particular his fellow defenders, down.

'What confidence does that (type of performance) give the young lads around him,' Carragher said on Sky Sports 1's Monday Night Football.

Jamie Carragher described Per Mertesacker's performance against Stoke City as 'unacceptable'

Peter Crouch scored within the first 25 seconds against Arsenal and Mertesacker was partly at fault

'He's got to help these (younger defenders) and protect them and stop them getting asked questions.  

'You're in a game away at Stoke in a tough venue - let your players around you know you're not going to accept what's going on.

'This is your captain on the day. We talk about leadership, character - like (Arsene) Wenger always talks about after the game.

'He's abandoned ship, he's left them on their own and that is not acceptable for a player of that quality and experience. He's abandoned ship. It's just not acceptable.'

Arsenal struggled to deal with Bojan (right) for large periods - Calum Chambers was sent off for this challenge

Young full back Hector Bellerin also looked as though he could have used more guidance from Mertesacker
