A third of Americans have been arrested by the time they are 23 according to a new study released in the Crime & Delinquency journal on Monday.

Amongst males the figure dramatically increases to almost half of black males and nearly 40 percent of white males, which can have a negative impact on their ability to find work, go to school and participate fully in their communities.

The study analyzed national survey data from 1997 to 2008 of teenagers and young adults and their arrest histories, which ranged from truancy and underage drinking to more serious and violent offenses. Minor traffic violations were excluded.

Almost half of black males have been arrested by the time they are 23 according to a new study released in the Crime & Delinquency journal on Monday

This is the first report since the 1960s on how the risk of arrest varies across race and gender, said Robert Brame, a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina and lead author of the study.

The study's most striking finding is the variance amongst males of different races:

Nearly 40 percent of white males have been arrested by the time they are 23, which can have a negative impact on their ability to find work, go to school and participate fully in their communities

‘A problem is that many males – especially black males – are navigating the transition from youth to adulthood with the baggage and difficulties from contact with the criminal justice system,’ said Brame.

The negative impacts can be great, he said. 

‘Criminal records that show up in searches can impede employment, reduce access to housing, thwart admission to and financing for higher education and affect civic and volunteer activities such as voting or adoption. They also can damage personal and family relationships.’

The research also looked at arrest rates amongst females, although unlike with their male counterparts there was little variation between races.

The report found that:

Brame says the next step is to develop an understanding of the economic, social and law enforcement factors that can influence arrests and what role gender and race play. 

The report found that by age 23, 49 percent of black males, 44 percent of Hispanic males and 38 percent of white males have been arrested

'As a society, we often worry a great deal about the effects of children watching television, eating junk food, playing sports and having access to good schools,' said Brame.

'Experiencing formal contact with the criminal justice system could also have powerful effects on behavior and impose substantial constraints on opportunities for America's youth.

'We know from our two studies that these experiences are prevalent and that they vary across different demographic groups.

'Going forward it will be constructive to support systematic studies into the sources of these variations and to continue efforts to understand the effects of criminal justice interventions on sanctions on future behavior.'
