A secret diary kept by fugitive terror suspect Samantha Lewthwaite has revealed her advice for being a good wife and having a happy marriage.

The 'white widow' of the one of the July 7 bombers wrote how she juggled family life with her jihad views while allegedly plotting terrorrist  attacks

On marriage she says: 'When a man comes home - wife beautiful, food prepared, kids clean... immediately he will forget the pain of his day. He will always want to come home.'

Fugitive: Samantha Lewthwaite wrote in her diary about how to be a good wife while allegedly plotting terror attacks

Lewthwaite advises women that a good wife should 'protect your hubby's money' and under the heading 'The art of saying sorry' she says women should not be stubborn.

Extracts seen by the Sunday Times, also reveal her plans to open a juice bar and frozen yoghurt stall with 'slimming smoothies' called Peanut Butter Bomb and the Mango Bang.

The diary was found in a police raid at a villa in the Kenyan resort of Mombasa where she was living with her four children before going on the run in December 2011.

The 29-year-old British Muslim convert is the world's most wanted woman after being accused of allegedly ordering the killings of two radical Muslim clerics, two Protestant preachers, and three others with links to terror-group al-Shabaab.

In her diary, Lewthwaite, from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, covered her 'to do list' for the juice bar with heart-shaped doodles and a drawing of a glass topped with a cocktail umbrella.

She priced the yoghurt at one scoop for 100 Kenyan shillings (70p) or four scoops for 300 shillings.

Lewthwaite described her 'Pregisize' classes for expectant mothers as 'specifically designed aerobic workouts with added strength and toning which are 100% safe.

Each member would get a 10 per cent discount, a 'stylish T-shirt', a monthly newsletter and healthy recipes.

The paper quotes her diary: 'Let us help you to maintain a healthy body and mind during this spiritual journey.'

Attack: The collapsed car park of the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi where al-Shabab gunmen killed more than 60 people

Wounded: A victim is carried away from the mall. The siege, which lasted several days, ended after soldiers stormed the building and the roof collapsed

Lewthwaite is the widow of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay, who blew himself up on a Piccadilly Line train between King's Cross St Pancras and Russell Square stations.

She was the daughter of a former soldier before converting to Islam.

The convert is linked to the Westgate Mall massacre in Nairobi in which 67 people were killed, and is thought to be hiding in Somalia.

Interpol issued a 'Red Notice' warrant for her arrest shortly after the attacks for terrorist offences in Mombasa dating back to 2011.
