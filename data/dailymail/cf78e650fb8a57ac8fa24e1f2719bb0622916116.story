Pro-marijuana advocates have been backed by billionaire George Soros for years, a new report has revealed.

Soros has funneled at least $80million towards legalization since 1994, and has been joined in his efforts by a former insurance executive who openly admitted he often smoked the drug.

The billionaire’s money finds its way into local ballot initiatives around the world via the Drug Policy Alliance and the American Civil Liberties Union, according to a Washington Times report detailing his unrivalled support for drug legalization.

Marijuana man: George Soros has been funding pro-pot legalization pushes to the tune of tens of millions of dollars

Joining Soros in his fervent support for marijuana legalization was former Progressive Insurance chairman Peter B Lewis, who died last year after donating at least $40million to the cause.

Soros and co have been behind every major marijuana legalization push in the United States, and even Uruguay, the paper claims.

His strategy is similar to the one that toppled prohibition, force the federal government’s hand by legalization through individual states.

The billionaire’s Open Society Foundations, which contribute roughly $4million annually to a variety of causes, carry an annual balance sheet of more than $3.5billion, according to 2011 tax returns.

David and Charles Koch, billionaire brothers active in conservative causes, had a relatively paltry $308million allotted to their foundation and institute, the paper noted.

Soros’ activism in the space is unrivaled by any opposing group, and accounts for about one-third of the Drug Policy Alliance’s annual operating budget, a group spokesperson admitted.

Those efforts helped realize the recreational use of marijuana in both Colorado and Washington during 2012 ballot initiative, according to the Times.

‘Mr. Soros, Lewis and their various nonprofits provided 68 percent of the funding that went to New Approach to Washington, the group that mobilized signatures to get the initiative on the state ballot and then promoted it,’ the paper reported.

Soros was also heavily involved in the push to legalize marijuana in Uruguay, the Times asserts.‘He also offered to pay for a study to evaluate the ramifications of the experimental legislation, which he has said will reduce overall drug use and help fight illegal drug trade,’ said the Times.

Those who oppose legalization say Soros and friends are buying their way to victory through brainwashing.

‘When we look at what we’ve been able to raise in other states, they raise millions. We’re lucky if we can raise $100,000. It’s been a process of basically brainwashing the public,’ Calvina Fay, the executive director of Save Our Society From Drugs, told the paper.

‘They run ads, put up billboards, get high-profile celebrity support and glowing media coverage. If you can repeat a lie often enough, the people believe,’ she continued. 

Next up on the agenda for 2014 are Alaska, Florida and Oregon, according to donation records obtained from those respective states.

The Soros-backed Marijuana Policy project has already donated $210,000 to state races and is expected to pour ‘hundreds of thousands of dollars to help fund a media blitz… to help support the measure,’ according to the report.

Soros and Lewis have combined to put almost $150,000 to work on an Oregon intiaitve, records showed.

Soros found a new partner in Florida in Democratic fundraiser John Morgan, and they have contributed 80 per cent of the funds used in that state.

Soros and friends are looking to Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana and Nevada for 2016, a source told the Times. Other states being considered are Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont.

‘It’s only a matter of time before marijuana is legalized under federal law,’ Tom Angell, founder and chairman of the Marijuana Majority, told the Times. 

‘We now have 20 states plus the District of Columbia with medical marijuana laws, two states have already legalized it for all adults over the age of 21 — politicians will have to follow the will of the people.’
