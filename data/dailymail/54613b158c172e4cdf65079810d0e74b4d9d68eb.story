Soldiers in the Territorial Army are 35-years-old on average, figures show.

Compared to the average age of a soldier in the regular service, who is 29, the reservists are six years older.

Critics say servicemen and women in the TA are not 'like for like' replacements of the armed services and say the reforms risk creating a 'Dad's Army'.

The Telegraph reports the average TA soldier is three years older than the average age of a first time dad in the UK, who is 32.

Ministry of Defence plans to increase reservist troops from 11,000 to 30,000 by 2018 to make up for the cuts to the regular army have come under criticism.

The MoD figures show the average age of senior TA officers is 51, junior officers are 42 and senior and junior NCOs are 46 and 38. In comparison, regular army officers are 37 years old and other ranks average at 29.

Questions: John Baron, Tory MP for Basildon and Billericay, raised questions about the plans

John Baron, Tory MP for Basildon and Billericay, raised questions about the Government's plans.

He told the Telegraph: 'The resulting capability gaps, the strong prospect of fals economies and a substantially older Army suggest the risks far outweigh any benefits.'

Earlier this year, campaigners warned controversial plans to replace thousands of full-time soldiers with reservists risks creating a new wave of veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

The aim is to reduce the number of regular soldiers from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2018 - an army small enough to fit inside Wembley Stadium - while doubling the number of reservists to 30,000.

But experts said Defence Secretary Philip Hammond's proposals could see a massive increase in the number of troops seeking help for severe psychological trauma.

An MoD spokesman said: 'Reservists have always been slightly older than their Regular counterparts, partly because they carry out so many specialist roles that require years of experience.

'However we are transforming our Reserve, strengthening its requirements and reversing its decline over the last decade.

'As part of this we are running sustained recruitment campaigns aimed at young people and are introducing higher fitness and deployability requirements. We expect that these measures will mean the average age of our Army Reserve will fall slightly.'
