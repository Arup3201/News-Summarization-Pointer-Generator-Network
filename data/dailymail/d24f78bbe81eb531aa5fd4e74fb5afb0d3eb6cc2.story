An Oklahoma middle school teacher has been fired for taking nearly a dozen of her students on a snack run, with two of them locked in the trunk of her sedan.

Heather Cagle, a veteran math teacher and yearbook instructor at Wells Middle School in Catoosa, was suspended in October after it was revealed that she had piled 11 children into her car to go to Wal-mart in the middle of the school day.

At the time, Cagle said she was trying to do 'something sweet' for her yearbook students by getting them treats.

Terminated: Heather Cagle, a veteran math teacher and yearbook instructor from Oklahoma, was fired Wednesday for taking 11 students off campus without permission in October to go on a snack run, with two of the kids riding in the trunk of her car 

Veteran educator: Cagle, a married mother of one, was hired by the Catoosa School District in 2005 

Cagle, a married mother of one, had been at the Catoosa school for a decade, reported Tulsa World. 

On October 21, Mrs Cagle invited 11 kids between the ages of 12 and 15 to go on a ride to a Wal-mart located in close proximity to the school to get some food.

She placed two students in the front seat of her Honda Accord, crammed seven in the backseat and stuffed a pair of 12-year-old girls into the trunk, according to school district attorney Karen Long.

The lawyer said Cagle was required to obtain signed permission from the students' parents before taking them out of school, which she had failed to do.

About 50 fellow teachers, parents and former students turned up at the meeting Wednesday to support Cagle as she tearfully begged district officials for her job, telling them that she never meant to hurt anyone and vowing to never repeat her ‘terrible mistake.’

Following a six-hour hearing, the Catoosa School Board voted 4-1 to terminate Cagle's employment.

'Student safety and well-being are of paramount importance to the administration, and the administration respects and supports the board's decision, Catoosa Superintendent Rick Kibbe said in a statement.

Tearful plea: During a hearing Wednesday, Cagle tearfully begged for her job, vowing never to repeat her 'terrible mistake'

Blowing off steam: Cagle and her attorney said she was just trying to do something nice and 'fun' for her students 

'Catoosa Public Schools has and will continue to be a district which provides all students with a safe and appropriate learning environment.'

Cagle's attorney, Richard O’Carroll, forcefully defended his client whom he called an 'exceptional teacher.'

‘There wasn't any danger and it was a farce. All you got to do is cry a lawsuit or something these days.’ O'Carroll told the station Fox23. ‘It wasn't the best judgement. She went 400 yards on an empty road through a parking lot. No one was hurt.’

The attorney representing the school said that the students suffered mental abuse, and that the teacher tried to cover up the sneaky snack run by telling the kids to keep it 'hush hush.’
