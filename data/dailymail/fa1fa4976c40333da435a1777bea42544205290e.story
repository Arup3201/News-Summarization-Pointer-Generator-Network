Gwyneth Paltrow's separation announcement may have surprised her fans Tuesday, but her decision to call the divorce a 'conscious uncoupling' won't surprise anyone who's ever read her GOOP lifestyle site.

That's precisely where Paltrow told the world she's parting ways with Coldplay crooner Chris Martin, followed by a lengthy explanation of the New Age process from her own lifestyle guru Dr. Habib Sadeghi and his wife.

Sure, it's a divorce, they explain: but it's a divorce all about the 'wholeness in separation,' 'coming together' and 'two people playing teacher.'

GOOPy divorce: Gwyneth Paltrow's announcement she'll be separating from husband of 10 years Chris Martin was a surprise to fans, but her decision to label the divorce a 'conscious uncoupling'--a decision endorsed by her physician friend and lifestyle guru Dr. Habib Sadeghi--will shock no one

Conscious uncoupling - a private act: 'We have always conducted our relationship privately, and we hope that as we consciously uncouple and coparent, we will be able to continue in the same manner,' Paltrow wrote on her GOOP lifestyle site

'We have always conducted our relationship privately,' Paltrow writes in a public announcement of the end of her marriage that immediately shut down her GOOP site. 'We hope that as we consciously uncouple and coparent, we will be able to continue in the same manner.'

She lets Drs. Sadeghi and wife Dr. Sherry Sami take it from there.

'A conscious uncoupling is the ability to understand that every irritation and argument was a signal to look inside ourselves and identify a negative internal object that needed healing,' they write.

The couple say that every pet peeve and bit of resentment is 'just the echo of an older emotional injury.'

'From this perspective,' they say, 'there are no bad guys, just two people, each playing teacher and student respectively.'

To the fans: The announcement showed up on Paltrow's GOOP site Tuesday evening and immediately garnered so much traffic, the site shut down

Dr. Habib Sadeghi D.O.

Paltrow's message about 'conscious uncoupling' was followed up on her website with a lengthy explanation of the GOOPy divorce technique by a couple of doctors named Habib Sadeghi and Sherry Sami.

The couple live in Los Angeles along with their son and daughter.

Sadeghi is a doctor of osteopathy who founded an LA clinic Be Hive of Healing, 'an integrative health center based in Los Angeles.'

'Through a unique and individualized approach to healthcare that includes evidence-based, Western medical interventions and intuitive Eastern healing modalities,' reads the bio on his clinic's website, 'Dr. Sadeghi has been able to achieve astounding results in patient cases that were otherwise deemed hopeless by traditional medicine.'

Sadeghi's expertise evidently also extends into the realm of marriage counseling.

According to his site, the clinic also provides services called Integrative Bioregulatory Medicine™ (iBm), Integrative Psycho-Synthesis (iPs), weight release, and Anthroposophical Medicine.

His most recent book is called Within: A Spiritual Awakening to Love & Weight Loss and contains a forward by Paltrow.

Sadeghi's wife is a children's dentist and orthodontist.

She believes that a healthy mouth equals a healthy body and that problems of the mouth such as constricted airways 'can affect a variety of symptoms such as ADHD, seizure, bed-wetting, grinding and mouth breathing, which can potentially alter the development of the face and jaws.'

So why can't they use their evolved presence of mind to simply move past resentments and stay together?

According to the teachings of conscious uncoupling, humans simply aren't meant to stay married for so long.

They point toward the exponential increase in lifespan that humans have experienced in the last century or so:

'We’re living three lifetimes compared to early humans, perhaps we need to redefine the construct. Social research suggests that because we’re living so long, most people will have two or three significant long-term relationships in their lifetime.

'Our biology and psychology aren’t set up to be with one person for four, five, or six decades.'

For super couple Paltrow and Martin, just one decade was apparently enough.

The post rounds itself out with a final bit of counter-intuition about how fantastic divorce can really be.

'You’ll see that although it looks like everything is coming apart; it’s actually all coming back together.'
