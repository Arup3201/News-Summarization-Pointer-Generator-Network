Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard can become part-time England players under Roy Hodgson’s plans for the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign.

Captain Gerrard and Lampard are considering their international futures, but Hodgson revealed they can pick and choose their games if they prolong their England careers.

Hodgson wants their experience around the squad following England’s dismal showing at the World Cup.

Plenty still to offer: Steven Gerrard has the option of continuing to play for England as they embark on qualifying for the 2016 European Championships

Carry on, Frank: Lampard has also been given the opportunity of postponing his international retirement

The manager said: ‘I’m not asking them to do anything they don’t want to do. If the question is, "could they still play a part?" then obviously the answer is "yes".

‘They probably could, but they are under no pressure whatsoever from me and I will accept whatever decisions they come up with.

‘It would be nice if they don’t formally retire because when players do they disappear from England selection.

‘There could be dialogue, perhaps, whereby at any moment I could speak to one of them and say, “do you want to play in this game, are you up for it?" That’s how I’d really like to see it.’

Hodgson has been given the FA’s full backing to continue as manager, despite finishing bottom of Group D, and maintains he has never considered walking away from the most prestigious job in English football.

Going nowhere: Roy Hodgson has been given assurances from the FA top brass that he can stay in his post until 2016

He added: ‘The FA have asked me to continue. They want me to continue. I’m very happy that they want me to continue.

‘I think there is an interesting group of players here to work with. I get no feeling that any of them will want me to resign. I have no reason to do so. I have no intention of doing so. I think I’ve stood up to the criticism, to the comments and that’s as much as I can do.

‘The reason I’m staying on is that I’m not a quitter. I believe in this team and that the FA seriously want me to keep doing this job, as do the players, therefore I’ll continue to do it and I’ll try to lead the team to Euro 2016 and try to get some good results.’

Impact: Hodgson also confirmed that psychologist Dr Steve Peters, speaking here with Steven Gerrard, will continue to work with the team going forward

Hodgson confirmed he will take psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters to Euro 2016 if England qualify for the tournament.

‘He’s been very, very good,’ Hodgson added. ‘He hasn’t played a major part in terms of global team talks — what he has done is he’s been very good with individual players.’
