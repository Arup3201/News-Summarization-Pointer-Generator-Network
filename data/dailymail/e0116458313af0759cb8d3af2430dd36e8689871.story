A husband and wife team who recruited bogus brides at the school gates face jail after they admitted arranging four sham marriages.

Polish mother-of-four Andzelina Surmaj, 30, and her 38-year-old Czech husband 
Milan Cina, will be sentenced next month after arranging the illegal weddings at churches in Accrington and Clayton-le-Moors, Lancashire.

Nigerian men were introduced to Cina as a
‘wedding organiser’ and paid the couple up to £4,500 to
trick the Home Office into granting them leave to remain in the UK on a
marriage visa.

and Slovak women outside her children's school to act as bogus brides

Surmaj would then approach cash-strapped
Czech and Slovak women from the local community outside her children's 
school - telling them they could earn £1,500 to act as a bride.

Burnley Crown Court heard how ‘naive’ clergy at St Peter’s Church and St Andrew’s Church, in Accrington, and All Saints Church, Clayton-le-Moors, were hoodwinked with false documents showing the bogus bride and groom lived together in the parish.

The ‘facilitators’ would then provide the wedding dress, transport and often act as witnesses to make sure the scam worked.

Surmaj, of Girlington Road, and her now 
estranged husband Cina, of Lister Gardens, both Bradford, admitted 
assisting unlawful immigration to member state by participating in the 
organisation of the sham marriages of Oladotun Ogundari to Alena 
Kuejova, Omorodian Idehen to Kristina Makunova, Josef Badzo to Mercy 
Idehen and Adegboyega Adekunle to Ingrid Gulasova.

Surmaj also admitted assisting unlawful immigration to a member state by taking part in a sham marriage to Samuel Kolawole in September 2009, making a false statement with reference to marriage by signing the church register at St Peter’s-in-Newbold and possessing a false Czech Republic identity card.

Cina also pleaded guilty to assisting unlawful immigration to member state by acting as a witness at the sham marriage of Lukman Durojaye to Maria Pretczynska in December 2008.

The other offences took place between 2008 and 2011.

The defendants will be sentenced on March 19 and were told by Judge Beverley Lunt they would be going to prison.

Surmaj alleged that she did not realise now serious it was to arrange the marriages and was bailed on condition that she lives at her home address, does not travel outside the UK and reports to the police station twice a week.

Cina was remanded in custody.

The case follows a lengthy investigation into 
around 50 ‘suspicious’ marriages in East Lancashire, and a number of 
successful prosecutions.

DI Paul Roach said: 'Rather than blend into the background of a metropolitan city, they played on the naivety of the rural parishes where they feel they won’ t be challenged and can brazen it out.

'Once they realise they can get away with it, they hammer away at one church until they get found out and then move on.'

Since the scale of the scam first came to light, Lancashire clergy have been educated on what warning signs to look out for if they suspect a bogus wedding.

No vicars in East Lancashire have been implicated in the sham marriages.
