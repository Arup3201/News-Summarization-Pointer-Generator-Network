The famous weathervane at the Home of Cricket has been damaged during high winds over the weekend. 

Father Time, who sits above the Mound Stand at Lord's, has been bent almost 90 degrees by strong wind in London.

Weekend gales in St John's Wood have knocked the deathly steel figure parallel to the ground, but mercifully still in his elevated roof-top position with scythe and bail on stumps intact.

The famous weathervane has been at Lord's since 1926 after it was presented to the MCC

Father Time is one of the famous features at Lord's and staff are working to get it back to normal

Staff from Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which owns Lord's, are working with specialists to restore it to its original position as soon as possible. 

Lord's is due to host its first game of the season on Sunday, April 12 when Middlesex entertain Nottinghamshire in the LV= County Championship. 

This is not the first time the weathervane has fallen foul of the elements, back in 1992 it was struck by lightning and the subsequent repairs were featured on children's TV show Blue Peter. 

Father Time was given to MCC in 1926 by the architect of the Lord's Grand Stand, Sir Herbert Baker. During World War II, it was wrenched from its original perch when it became entangled in the steel cable of a barrage balloon.

Father Time tweeted to say he had been diagnosed with copper damage and will be undergoing treatment

It was reattached to the top of the Grand Stand where it sat until 1996 when it was relocated to the Mound Stand.

The symbolism of the figure derives from Law 16(3) of the Laws of Cricket: 'After the call of Time, the bails shall be removed from both wickets.'

But he has, as his name indicates, moved with the times - and tweets these days on behalf of Lord's Cricket Ground, including an update on his latest mishap.

The two posts read: 'NEWS: I've was felled by high winds last night! Ouch!

'Apologies for my poor grammar in the previous tweet - but I'm not feeling my best after being damaged last night!'

Father Time later tweeted: 'I've been diagnosed with copper damage and will be undergoing treatment ASAP.'
