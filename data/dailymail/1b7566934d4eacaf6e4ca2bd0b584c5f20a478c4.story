It is the news that could finally stop culinary Insta-spammers in their tracks. A team of scientists has discovered that sharing and consuming an excess of food pictures may actually decrease pleasure in the real thing.

It is an unwelcome truth that many of us now celebrate a culinary triumph or top notch restaurant meal not by instantly diving in - but with a photo session. The phrase ‘Tweet before you eat’ has entered common parlance and we no longer flinch when the party at the table next to us begins snapping away at their plate (though we draw the line when they come over to snap ours - true story).

However, new research from Brigham Young 
University suggests that oversharing and consuming ‘food porn’ on social 
media sites such as Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram can make it less 
enjoyable to eat.

Many people simply can not start eating a meal without ensuring they have shared the experience with friends and followers

Looking at those pictures of perfect eggs Benedict or your friend’s incredible Sunday roast efforts can ruin rather the whet the appetite by making you feel like you have already eaten the food.

The study found that overexposure to images of foods increases our sense of satiation (a drop in enjoyment associated with repeated consumption) when we actually eat those same foods.

One of the study’s coauthors and BYU professor Ryan Elder explains: ‘In a way, you’re becoming tired of that taste without even eating the food.

'It’s sensory boredom – you’ve kind of moved on. You don’t want that taste experience anymore.’

Published in the Journal of Consumer Psychology, the study recruited 232 people to look at and rate pictures of food.

In devastating news to poser foodies everywhere, sharing pictures of your food may actually decrease your pleasure in it

In one of their studies, half of the participants viewed 60 pictures of sweet foods like cake, truffles and chocolates, while the other half looked at 60 pictures of salt foods such as chips, pretzels and French fries.

After rating each picture based on how appetising that food appeared, each participant finished the experiment by eating peanuts, a salty food. Participants then rated how much they enjoyed eating the peanuts.

In the end, the people who had looked at the salty foods ended up enjoying the peanuts less, even though they never looked at peanuts, just at other salty foods. The researchers say the subjects were satiated on the specific sensory experience of saltiness.

If we avoid looking at pictures of salads, we might enjoy them more

Supposedly, looking extensively at pictures of delicious sweet treats can help curb your cravings....

'No it's OK, I looked at loads of cake pictures earlier!' This food-photo phenomenon could be used to help those trying to reduce cravings

While this could be bad news for those of us who regularly post or look at foodie images online, the findings could actually be of some use to dieters

Those with a serious penchant for a certain naughty food, say ice-cream, may be able to reduce their enjoyment in a Ben & Jerry’s binge by viewing numerous pictures of their weakness food.
