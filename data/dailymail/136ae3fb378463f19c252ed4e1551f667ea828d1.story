David Furnish, Zachary Furnish-John, Elijah Furish-John and Sir Elton John at the Woodside End of Summer party

Say what you like about Sir Elton John, but he certainly knows how to throw a party. For years, his annual White Tie and Tiara ball — held at his opulent Woodside mansion in Old Windsor, to raise money for his Aids Foundation — has been one of the social events of the season.

Now, having apparently been scrapped because of an influx of ‘riff-raff’, the event was reborn on Thursday night as the Woodside End Of Summer Party.

Liz Hurley was there, along with an eclectic selection of Sir Elton and David Furnish’s chums, including comedian David Walliams, actor Sir Ian McKellen and designer Jasper Conran.

So what went on in Old Windsor? Who is the millionaire who paid £50,000 to kiss Elizabeth Hurley? And why was David Furnish the big talking point of the night?

HERE COME THE D-LISTERS

Not everyone who came to the £3,000-a-ticket event in the grounds of Sir Elton’s lavish home was in the superstar bracket. Male model David Gandy — who turns up at parties all over town — was there, as was socialite Tamara Beckwith, who pronounced herself knocked out by the ‘festival vibe’ of the party.

Hollyoaks actor Kieron Richardson also scored an invite, as did Rosanna Davison, the daughter of crooner Chris de Burgh, who is known mainly for winning Miss World way back in 2003.

Higher up the celebrity food chain, Sir Elton played host to David Walliams and his supermodel wife, Lara Stone, and also comedian Jimmy Carr and his girlfriend Karoline Copping. Lulu was in attendance, too.

In previous years, Sir Elton has welcomed such luminaries as Catherine Zeta Jones, Rod Stewart, Naomi Campbell as well as former U.S. President Bill Clinton and the Duchess of York.

The lack of big-hitters this year, it seems, was mainly down to timing. At this point in the calendar, the Hollywood crowd are in Venice for the film festival, while the fashionistas are in the Big Apple for New York Fashion Week.

THE VENUE

Sir Elton bought Woodside in 1975 and his staff have been known to mutter that it’s bigger than nearby Windsor Castle, with eight bedrooms, a billiards room, 30 acres and a squash court. As Elton himself shrugs: ‘One queen living next door to another.’

The spectacular estate boasts a Roman terrace, Italian gardens, a secret garden and a white scented garden. Indeed, the gardens are so big that guests were offered a tour by rickshaw. There were some grumbles that there weren’t quite enough rickshaws to go around, though, and there were also long queues for the lavatories.

At the start of the evening, Sir Elton and David came out to mingle with their two sons, born to a surrogate mother. Zachary, nearly four, and Elijah, 20 months, are regulars at their fathers parties

THE SMALL TALK

At the start of the evening, Sir Elton and David came out to mingle with their two sons, born to a surrogate mother. Zachary, nearly four, and Elijah, 20 months, are regulars at their fathers’ parties and have also been wheeled out at Sir Elton’s Oscars bash. They were wearing matching £95 canvas shoes in the classic Burberry check and little Elijah kept a tight grasp of his Thomas The Tank Engine toy throughout.

A guest says they stayed at the event for around an hour before being taken off to bed at 8.30pm. Apparently they are Sir Elton’s only topic of conversation now, and he chatted about them to all the guests all night, from potty training to his choice of schools. Very un-rock ’n’ roll.

DAVID THE HUNK 

David Furnish’s muscular physique was the talk of the party. He posted pictures to his Instagram account recently showing some impressive muscles, a result of serious iron pumping. He has also allowed his hair to go grey.

He was very much the social powerhouse at the party and circulated with a determination to speak to every guest. Elton, known for being a little reticent on social occasions, was said to be ‘a bit quiet, but David was on fine form’, said a guest.

THE BOW-TIE BAN 

No more white tie — the dress code this year was ‘summer chic’. This translated as the usual red-carpet dresses for the ladies, and lounge suits for the men. David channelled the Great Gatsby look in a pink jacket.

Elton donned a midnight-blue tuxedo with a long platinum chain, and — ever flamboyant — some hand-made sparkly shoes, thought to be by American husband-and-wife designers Donald J. and Lisa Pliner, and costing an eye-watering £10,000 a pair.

THE CARNATION CULL

Sir Elton remained true to his favourite florist Rob Van Helden, who favours gigantic displays of spectacular and immaculate flowers. Van Helden knows Sir Elton will not tolerate chrysanthemums, carnations or lilies at any price.

He has been decorating Sir Elton’s parties for decades and did the flowers for his civil partnership to Furnish in 2005. He garlanded the statues in the garden with stunning displays of roses and hydrangeas.

POSH FIZZ AND NOSH

there were masses of champagne and Grey Goose vodka cocktails, while staff seemed to have been told to refill glasses after three sips. They also offered to mix any drinks that were requested.

Dinner was a rather unadventurous affair of smoked salmon, followed by chicken with grilled vegetables and then fruit tart.

THE COSTLY KISS

After dinner, the serious business of fundraising got under way. Liz Hurley, who has attended every Elton summer party since 2001, flew in from New York, where she has been filming, to support him.

She is best friends with both Elton, 67, and Furnish, 51, a film-maker — Elton gave her away at her wedding to Arun Nayar and the pair are godparents to her son, Damian.

Julian Bharti, a 27-year-old investment banker, won the lot of a kiss with Liz, paying a staggering £50,000 for his ten-second grapple.

Those who were there contend that the actress was very game about it, but kept her teeth firmly clenched just in case.

Bharti is the son of Stan Bharti, who founded the Forbes and Manhattan investment bank. He is the MD of the Delano Capital Corporation and lives in Toronto with his wife, Christy, and their three children. To give some idea of his wealth, he bought a $5.5 million holiday home in Los Angeles, which he spent $3 million renovating, but is selling it again because it’s too much effort to visit it.

He told me: ‘My father and I were kindly invited by the amazing people at Chopard, so I would extend a special thanks to them if given the opportunity.

‘And the kiss — well, I have had a crush on Elizabeth Hurley since I was about eight years old, and we noticed they were trying to get people excited to donate. I joked to my father that it would be funny if I made a big donation in exchange for a kiss with Elizabeth.

‘And, before I knew it, Dad had whisked me over to her asking if she would be cool with that, which she kindly was, and all of a sudden I was standing on the stage with Elton John who was announcing the contribution and kiss. The entire thing was a unique “once-in-a-lifetime” experience for me — and, of course, the kiss was amazing!

‘I would like to thank Elizabeth Hurley for being a good trouper. As a very happily married man, I would also add that my wife, who is back in Toronto, loved the entire story.’

SINGING FOR SUPPER 

Entertainment was provided by Gary Barlow, Chrissie Hynde and James Blunt. Sir Elton also sang. Afterwards, celebrity DJ Fatboy Slim opened a pop-up nightclub with dancers and a spectacular light show until 1am. Elton is not one for dancing, but his partner was on the dance floor with Hynde until the bitter end.
