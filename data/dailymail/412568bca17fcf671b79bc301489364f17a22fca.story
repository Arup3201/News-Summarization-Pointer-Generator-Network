Google has
 backed down in a row over free speech by re-instating links to news 
stories it had previously stripped from the internet.

The
 company was accused of over-zealously tearing down links to webpages 
following demands from people claiming their so-called 'right to be 
forgotten'.

But
 links to articles which had previously been deleted have now 
re-appeared on the website after public outcry at what many viewed as 
unacceptable censorship of the internet.

Google has reinstated links to news articles after accusations a new ruling on the 'right to be forgotten' was leading to unacceptable censorship of the internet

Earlier 
this week, MailOnline reported how links to a number of completely 
accurate news stories had disappeared from Google's search results 
following requests using a controversial European Court of Justice 
ruling.

The
 changes meant anyone searching for information through the search 
engine would have been completely unaware the news stories existed.

Following the widespread criticism of the new system, many links were today re-indexed on Google.

A
 MailOnline article about a Scottish referee found to have lied about 
his reasons for giving a penalty during a top flight football match was among those re-instated.

The webpage had been among the first removed from Google after the new rules came into force.

MailOnline understands that links to articles on other news websites have now also been reinstated.

Google
 has declined to comment on the re-appearing links, but this morning 
insisted the process of deleting search results was still 'work in 
progress'.

Links to a MailOnline article about Scottish referee Dougie McDonald, who lied about a penalty incident, have been re-instated on Google following outcry at so-called 'right to be forgotten' rules

Head of communications Peter Barron told the BBC: 'We have to balance a whole range of things - 
free expression, privacy and the public's right to know.

'This
 is new territory for us all. We opposed the ruling. There's no right of
 appeal in the ECJ but we think it's important to have a public debate 
about this. This is a very, very important issue for the future of 
privacy, free expression and journalism.'

It

 emerged earlier today that Google now has a backlog of more than 
250,000 censorship requests to deal with and is deleting links purely 
because people did not want their comments on news stories to be viewed 
online.

Mr
 Barron said: 'The European Court of Justice ruling was not 
something that we welcomed or wanted, but it is now the law in Europe 
and we are obliged to comply with that law.

Google's Peter Barron today said the new law is not something the company 'wanted or welcomed'

'We
 are aiming to deal with it as responsibly as possible. We've had more 
than 70,000 requests so far. That's a huge task. In most cases we've had
 about four webpages per request, so that's something like 250,000 
requests to remove content.'

BBC 
economics editor Robert Peston this week highlighted a letter he had received from
 Google about a 2007 blog post he wrote about investment bank Merrill 
Lynch and its former boss Stan O'Neal, which would no longer be shown 
in some search results.

It emerged today that the page was not hidden in response to a 
complaint from the bank or Mr O'Neal, but a request from a member of the
 public who posted a response to the blog and no longer wanted it to be 
available to people searching his name.

Mr
 Barron acknowledged that Mr Peston's article was 'very much in the 
public interest', but said: 'It relates to an ordinary member of the 
public who left a comment on Robert's blog - maybe something 
embarrassing - and he contacted Google and asked to have that page 
revealed.

'If
 you search for Merrill Lynch it will appear. If you search for Stan 
O'Neal it will appear. Only if you search for the very narrow term of 
the name of the individual commenter would it not appear.'

Mr
 Barron added: 'We have to balance the need for transparency with the 
need to protect people's identity as well. In all cases where we remove 
content, we let the webmaster of the site know that we've removed 
content.'

Mr
 Peston said it was 'a bit weird' that his article could be blocked 
because an individual regretted a comment he had voluntarily posted 
years ago.

He
 said: 'People voluntarily put things up. Nobody coerces them to leave 
comments on my blog. I just think it's slightly odd that there should 
now be a law in place that basically says if you feel a bit embarrassed 
about what you said, you can hide yourself.

'I'm not 
saying it's Google's problem, but it does seem to me to be something a 
bit weird about a world in which you can allow people to cause enormous 
bureaucratic difficulties for all the search engine companies and lots 
of uncertainty about what can be found and can't be found, just because 
they feel a bit embarrassed about what they said a few years earlier.

'This does seem a sort of feather-bedding of people that some might think is a bit over the top.'

A warning telling website users that links may have been taken down now appears in some search results

Internet
 users have found that they are able to keep hold of links to their 
archive by using the US domain Google.com, rather than the .co.uk domain
 bound by the European rules.

The
 purge of search results applies to Google's local search pages covering
 the EU's 28 member nations and four other European countries, 
encompassing more than 500 million people.

But users in Europe who switch to the firm's American domain, Google.com, will find unaltered search results.

Google
 is only deleting information that appears on its own results pages. It 
has no control over information on external websites, which did not fall
 under the court's ruling.

The internet giant said it is currently receiving about 1,000 requests for the removal of information per day.

Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘This draconian ruling risks turning internet search engines from being the great 21st century emancipators of millions of ordinary people into arbitrary censors.’ 

Which article has Google reinstated?

Scottish referee Dougie McDonald quits with a stinging blast at the SFA and his critics 

In
 November 2010, we reported how under-fire referee Dougie McDonald 
delivered a withering blast at Scottish football as he finally bowed to 
mounting pressure and quit the game.

McDonald,

 who was found to have lied about his reasons for granting a penalty in a
 Celtic v Dundee United match, took a pot shot at former Parkhead winger
 Aiden 
McGeady and Dundee United manager Peter Houston.

McDonald
 could not resist one final verbal volley at the SFA, claiming their 
lack of support led to a weekend strike by Scottish match officials, 
while pointing the finger at McGeady and Houston for allegedly 
questioning his integrity.
