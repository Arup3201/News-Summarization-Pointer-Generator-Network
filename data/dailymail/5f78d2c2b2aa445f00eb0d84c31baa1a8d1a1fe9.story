To celebrate the first birthday of the nation's beloved Prince George, FEMAIL launched a picture competition last week, asking readers to nominate their little lookalike princes (and princesses).

The response was phenomenal and we received thousands of entries, from those who looked scarily similar to George, to those who were perhaps long lost cousins. We even had a few parents who tried to enter themselves as Duke and Duchess doppelgängers!

However, our hunt is over, and we have found a baby so alike to His Royal Highness that he ought to start practicing a finger painting signature.

Meet Marc Younis, an 11 month-old from London, who beat hundreds of hopefuls and today claims the crown of the best Prince George lookalike.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Doppelganger: 11-month-old Marc (left) is the winner of our Prince George lookalike competition - and as these photos reveal, he's the very image of the young royal (right)

The judging panel agreed that it is 
Marc's adorable chubby cheeks and wide-eyed look that helps him bear such a 
striking resemblance to the young Prince.

The two boys are also of very similar ages meaning that their height and body stature is almost identical.

However,
 the most noticeable similarity between the two babies was the prominent
 eyebrows that both boys have, with George taking after his father Prince
 William.

Nella Nam, Marc's mother, says that like Prince George, Marc has just started to take his first steps.

Separated at birth? The judging panel agreed that both Marc (left) and Prince George (right) shared the same chubby cheeks and bold eyebrows 

'He's very energetic like the Prince and just starting on his feet,' she said.

She adds that her little prince is already a bit of a connoisseur when it comes to dinner time.

'Marc is a
 very loveable cuddly boy but he has very picky taste already in food! 
He can never get enough of cheese sandwiches! There has to be always one
 in his hand.'

When
 it comes to entertainment Marc has to do without royal tours and 
stuffed bilbys but has developed a taste for the high tech.

Drooling with delight: Marc pulls the perfect George pout at his baptism

They could be twins! Marc (left) and George (right) share the same fair hair, curious expression and cheeks

'Cbeebies is a show that keeps him occupied the whole day and he's already tech savvy enough to try and turn on the episodes on my iPad.'

It isn't just the MailOnline who have picked up on the identical features of the two boys, Nella says that friends constantly compare her son to the young Prince.

'Since I have put his pictures up everyone has noticed the similarities so it would be something very special for him to be remembered as prince George's 1 year old birthday doppelgänger!' 

The competition was extremely close and although Marc was our clear winner we had a lot of entries from babies who will surely be practising their Prince George pout for years to come.
