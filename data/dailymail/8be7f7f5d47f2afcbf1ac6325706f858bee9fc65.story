It has been viewed more than 8 million times on YouTube, and now the video of seven-year-old brain cancer patient Jack Hoffman scoring a touchdown for his Nebraska Husker team has been named the best moment of the year at the ESPY awards.

'This is super-duper awesome,' Jack, of Atkinson, Nebraska, said as he collected the trophy from  Tate Donovan and Kerry Walsh-Jennings. 'I'm glad you are all now on Team Jack, I know with you, we can't lose.'

The video of Jack Hoffman, who has been 
fighting brain cancer, showed the boy running across the pitch and 
scoring a 69-yard touchdown before being lifted on to the shoulders of 
the players in April.

Jack was accompanied to the Los Angeles awards with his family and Taylor Martinez, the Nebraska Huskers quarterback who helped guide him across the line for his touchdown, according to SB Nation.

Jack was up against tough competition in the Best Moment category, with fellow nominees including Olympic soccer player Alex Morgan, Olympic tennis gold medalist Andy Murray and Indianapolis Colts head coach Chuck Pagano, who has also battled cancer.

'We’re not what you would call red carpet people and so we've had some great fellow Nebraskans lend a helping hand in that regard,' Mr Andy told 1011.

Jack proved to have plenty of fans among the high-profile sportsmen at the ceremony.

Many of them, including South Carolina's Jadeveon Clowney, ESPN anchor Stuart Scott and Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson posted pictures of them posing with Jack on social media, Omaha.com reported.

The brave cancer patient's chance to join the Huskers came through his family's friendship with the team's former star running back Rex Burkhead.

Burkhead befriended Jack shortly after the brain cancer was diagnosed in April 2011. Their friendship grew into the Team Jack campaign that has raised awareness and funds for research.

'Jack is a fighter, a strong kid,' Burkhead said. 'To see him run around and enjoy the Husker experience, it's a dream come true, especially for kids in the state of Nebraska.'

The video of the sports fan, who announced last month that he had completed his last round of chemotherapy, moved so many people that he was invited to meet the President.

Jack's father, Andy Hoffman, said President Obama presented his son with a new football and told him he was proud of him.

'We’re honored because Jack represents every kid who has gone through this horrific disease without any changes in the first-line protocol to treat his form of pediatric brain cancer in 25 years,' he added.

His son's touchdown also resulted in Upper Deck, a sports and entertainment trading card company, creating a sports trading card for the 7-year-old, KETV7 reported.

Jack won 
the hearts of fans and everyone in the football program for his 
courageous bout with brain cancer during his appearance in April.

Wearing a miniature Burkhead uniform complete with a No. 22 jersey, Jack ran onto the field late in the scrimmage. He then ran 69 yards for a spectacular touchdown that he celebrated in front of the crowd of 60,174.

Running back Burkhead is the captain of the support network Team Jack.

On
a fourth-and-1 play, he took a handoff from Martinez. Jack started 
running left, but Martinez redirected him. The little guy turned on a 
dime and followed a wall of blockers down the field.

Players
from the Red and White squads left their sidelines and followed him 
into the end zone to mob him and lift him on their shoulders after his 
69-yard touchdown.

The crowd at Memorial Stadium cheered as Jack celebrated - a moment that left his father misty-eyed on the sideline.

Asked what he was thinking when he ran on to the field, Jack said, 'Scoring a touchdown.' And when he broke free and scored? 'It felt awesome.' And the crowd reaction? 'Really awesome.'

Football operations director Jeff Jamrog and fullback C.J. Zimmerer came up with the idea to get Jack involved in the spring game.

Mr Jamrog had called the Hoffmans before the game to tell them the Huskers had a special play planned for Jack.

Receivers coach Rich Fisher motioned Jack over on the sideline to show him the play he drew up. Mr Hoffman said that's when it hit him that his son really would get his day in the sun at Memorial Stadium.

'It was a lot of emotions right at once,' Andy said. 'Very emotional to see that. Husker fans have been so incredible to Jack and our family and especially to this cause.'

Mr Hoffman said Jack was 'doing 
great' and that an MRI at Children's Hospital in Boston showed that the 
tumor has shrunk substantially in the past year. 'We're very optimistic for Jack,' he added.

Burkhead,
who is preparing for the NFL draft, said he got as much joy out of 
Jack's touchdown as he did for any of the ones he scored for the 
Huskers.

'For Jack to get down here and do it, I know it made his day.'
