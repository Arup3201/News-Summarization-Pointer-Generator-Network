Police have reopened the case of a 7-month-old New Jersey girl who went missing more than 26 years ago.

Melissa Diane McGuinn disappeared from her Trenton, New Jersey, home on March 6, 1988, and while her family haven't seen or heard from her since, her mother, Becky McGuinn House, is convinced she's still alive.

And recently Trenton police got a new lead that could prove she's right.

'I've always felt in my heart that she is out there,' House told ABC News. 'It's not just a whimsy feeling. It's a strong feeling. I feel she is alive.'

Tragic: Becky McGuinn House with her daughter Melissa who disappeared aged just 7 months

When Melissa went missing, House and her husband Robert McGuinn were sharing a row house in Trenton with another couple - Wanda Reed and her partner - who had an infant son.

The two young mothers became close friends and regularly cared for each other's children to give the other a break.

So House was not worried on that fateful day when Wanda took her baby girl downstairs while House got dressed.

But minutes later, House heard arguing and a neighbor allegedly came running up the stairs and asked where Melissa was.

'(I felt) like somebody had ripped my heart out,' House said.

A massive search began but there was no sign of the missing infant.

Reed was arrested on kidnapping charges but her story about what happened chopped and changed and finally she was deemed mentally unfit to stand trial.

'She was 30 years old, but she had the mind capacity of a 5-, 6-year-old,' House told ABC.

Search: New Jersey police searched for the missing baby but the case went cold after several years

Reopened: However, police have now reopened the case of Melissa, who they believe would look like the picture, right, now

She reportedly first told detectives she
 gave baby Melissa to a man in a car but her description of the car 
changed when pressed.

She later said she threw the baby in the nearby Delaware River.

An intense search of the river ensued but police found no evidence the story was true.

Law enforcement continued to chase leads for several years but then the case went cold and was closed.

After their loss, House and McGuinn moved to Arkansas where they started a new life, having more children. But they always held out hope of finding their little girl.

'The hardest part is not knowing,' House told ABC.

'Knowing that there's a beautiful young lady out there somewhere that is mine. And I don't know: dead, alive, mistreated, happy?'

After her husband died in 2008, House said she always lost hope she'd be reunited with Melissa.

But that same year she received a call out of the blue from New Jersey State Police Sgt. Wanda Stajanov who had a new lead in the case.

While the lead didn't go anywhere, Stajanov was moved by the case.

'When she called, I felt like there was some hope that somebody actually cared,' House told the TV network.

With Detective Paul Sciortino, Stajanov has been re-interviewing witnesses and going through old police reports in an effort to finally solve the mystery of where House's little girl disappeared to.

'I absolutely believe that she's still out there,' said Sciortino.

And luckily the investigators actually have a sample of Melissa's DNA, so if they find someone who fits her description they'll easily be able to match her.

So far four women all in their mid-twenties have been tested, and all but one have been ruled out.

House and the detectives are eagerly waiting DNA results on the fourth but if that too is not her daughter, she said she'll never stop looking.

'I feel one of these days, I'm going to walk up and actually look at myself, just younger. And it's going to be her,' she said.
