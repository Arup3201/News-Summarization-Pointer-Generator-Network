Kathlyn Ehl, a policy advisor to gubernatorial Republican candidate Rob McKenna has apologised after writing on her Twitter page: 'shut up and speak english #asians,' on January 25

But the tweets only came to attention recently after The Stranger published them

Yesterday Mr McKenna branded the tweets both 'insensitive and wrong.'

They were posted online before Miss Ehl joined his campaign in April.

They were quickly deleted, but remained accessible on archived Web pages.

In an email message to The Seattle Times, Miss Ehl apologized.

'These insensitive comments were harmful, not just to those groups which I mentioned in the tweets, but also to my family, friends and my co-workers," she wrote.

'For causing that pain, I am sorry.'

She recently graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in political science, according to her LinkedIn profile.

'My actions were not just unfortunate, they were offensive,' she wrote in the email.

'It is a lesson to others that social media comments made in frustration not only can hurt others, but they exist long after the moment has passed.'

Yesterday afternoon McKenna released a statement saying he was glad she had apologised.

'The fact that she made the comments before joining my campaign does not make them any less hurtful to Asian Americans and the elderly.

'They were insensitive and wrong regardless of their context.

'She has done the right thing by apologizing. I am hopeful that she has learned a humbling lesson that will give her greater perspective about having charity in her heart when considering the challenges faced by others.'
