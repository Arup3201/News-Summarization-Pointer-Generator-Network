The former US Marine who killed American Sniper Chris Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield has been moved into a psychiatric prison for evaluation of whether he should be moved into the general prison population. 

Eddie Ray Routh was transferred on Monday to Jester IV Unit, a psychiatric facility in Richmond, about 25 miles outside Houston.

Routh was convicted on February 28 of double murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole.

Routh, pictured here during his trial, argued that he was insane and not criminally liable when he killed Kyle and Littlefield in 2013

His lawyers argued that he suffered from mental illness, including PTSD from his time serving in the military, even though he never saw combat. 

A jury rejected his insanity defense that he should be put in a psychiatric treatment facility instead of prison.

However, because of his psychiatric state, Routh could still be kept out of the general prison population and be kept in a mental facility in the prison system instead. 

He was transferred from a state prison near Abilene, where he underwent an initial evaluation, to Jester IV Unit, which has more advanced medical facilities.

When Routh was transferred from county jail into the state prison system on March 6, a new booking mugshot was released by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. 

The Marine veteran appears thinner since he last appeared in public on the day of his murder conviction. 

The 2013 murder of Kyle, a Navy SEAL who wrote the best-selling book American Sniper, and his friend Littlefield drew nationwide attention.

Kyle is the deadliest sniper in American history, with 160 confirmed kills. 

His trial took place not long after the release of 'American Sniper' the movie, an Oscar-winning biopic that starred Bradley Cooper as Kyle.
