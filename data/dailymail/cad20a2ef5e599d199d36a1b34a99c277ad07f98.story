A mother has been given a new zest for life after losing 11 stone through diet and exercise. 

Wendi Huggett, 40, once weighed 21st 1lb and wore size 34 clothing. Her large size made it difficult for her to move around pain free and she felt ashamed that her daughter had a 'fat mum'.

Now Wendi, of Llanelli, has completely transformed her lifestyle and her figure - and has never felt better.

Health kick: Wendi has dropped 11st after taking up Zumba and changing her diet. She used to weight 21st 1lb

She now weighs 9st 11lb and is a size eight and teaches five Zumba classes a week to help other people improve their health and fitness.  

She said: 'I'm fitter and happier, and I'm much more capable of dealing with the challenges which life throws at me.

'I love teaching classes, and I get a huge amount of satisfaction at being able to provide a service for other women who are keen to become healthier.'

Wendi piled on the pounds after having her daughter, daughter Tierney, now 14, as she suffered from severe postnatal depression. Through comfort eating, she gained seven stone in just three years.

She said: 'I developed what I consider now to be an addiction to food. In the depths of depression I felt as if I couldn't control anything - but I could control what I ate. So if I wanted to have a bar of chocolate or a round of toast to make me feel better, I didn't hold back.'

As the weight piled on, she began experiencing joint and back pain and was so depressed she would avoid leaving the house unless strictly necessary.

Low confidence: She was concerned that her daughter would be bullied because of her size

She said: 'It became increasingly difficult to move around, which just fed into the cycle. After a while even something as simple as standing up long enough to finish washing the dishes was extremely difficult.

'On the rare occasions when I did venture out of the house, I felt as if I was under scrutiny. Little children would point at me and ask their parents why I was so large. When I went shopping, I was paranoid that people were peering into my shopping basket, looking for sweets and treats which would explain why I was so fat.'

When Tierney turned three, Wendi made the decision to lose weight for the sake of her daughter.

She said: 'I couldn't bare the thought of Tia being bullied in school. I had been larger than average at school and had experienced some bullying. I didn't want Tia to be made an object of fun because she had a fat mum.

Transformed: Wendi was a dress size 34, right, until she stuck to a diet and joined the gym. Now she's a size 8

'In the years since her birth I'd tried dieting, but had only managed to yo-yo my weight. I realised I could only make a lasting change if I overhauled my whole attitude to food.'

She swapped her toast with butter and cheese for breakfast for porridge. The ham and coleslaw sandwiches she once had for lunch were replaced with a more protein-heavy meal such as chicken with salad.

The creamy chicken pasta bake with garlic bread she once devoured as an evening meal was ditched in favour of brown rice with steamed vegetables and salmon. And she resisted snacking on a family-sized bar of milk chocolate throughout the day like she used to.

Along with her new healthy eating plan, which she still maintains, she joined her local gym where she started doing cardio interval training. 

She said: 'I hated doing the gym at first, but doing a bit of running, followed by a bit of cross training and rowing, made it more varied and interesting.'

Seven months after changing her diet, she lost eight stone and this encouraged her to keep going with her new, healthy lifestyle.

She said: 'A personal instructor at the gym liked to demonstrate how much I was losing by going into the weights room and coming out with the equivalent of what I'd lost between milestones. It was a huge motivator.'

Then she discovered Zumba classes - which led to her following a new career path.

She explained: 'I decided to investigate Zumba classes. I loved the energy and the music, but at one class the instructor was so bored and listless that I thought, "I could do better than this".'

NOW: Porridge

LUNCH

DINNER

NOW: Brown rice with steamed vegetables and salmon

She took a training course to become an official instructor and led her first class in June 2011. 

She said: 'Being up there in front a class is a huge rush. I'm proud of my commitment towards the women in my classes. I'll never let them down - even if there's only three or four people in the class, I'll never call a class off.'

Now Wendi says she's glad her daughter has a mother she can feel proud of and she sets her an example of healthy living. 

She said: 'Tia's enormously proud of me, too. She looks at pictures of the old me and can't quite believe it.

'I'm happy to say that she's fitter and stronger than I was at her age. She's very mindful of nutrition and loves kickboxing. It's satisfying to see that she's managed to avoid some of the traps I fell into at that age.'
