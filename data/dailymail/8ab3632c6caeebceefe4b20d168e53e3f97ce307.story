A morning commuter bashfully played down his reputation as a hero today after he grabbed a gun without hesitation from a robber who pointed the weapon in his face.

Casey Borgen was listening to music and engrossed in his phone on a Seattle bus on November 25 when he leapt into action, tackling the robber as other passengers rushed to help him. 

Mr Borgen said on Friday: 'A lot of people thought it was a conscious action to try and take him down but it was pure instinct. I recall thinking as it was happening that it was a bad idea.'

Unlikely hero: Casey Borgen said it was 'pure instinct' which caused him to grab the gun that a robber pointed in his face during his morning commute in Seattle

Mr Borgen looks up from his phone in shock to see a gun being pointed in his face on the Seattle bus - before he sprung into action and tackled the gunman

When asked during an interview with Today whether he would repeat his bravery, Mr Borgen said: 'Absolutely not. I've abstractedly thought about the idea of being mugged for a phone but it was so preposterous.

'But in the moment with no real understanding of why a gun was being pointed at me, something came over me.

'I had no thoughts about doing a good deed or anything but the people who jumped in.. they had the choice to help.'

Mr Borgen, pictured with his wife Liz and his two young children, said she was shocked that he had stood up to a gunman who tried to mug him

He said that his family were in disbelief over his actions and that he had really surprised his wife Liz.

He added: 'I'm fairly mild-mannered, I have no martial arts training.... but things turned out ok.'

Mr Borgen said that the incident would not put him off riding the bus.

He said that he
 could not remember what music he was listening to when he was accosted 
by the armed mugger because his iPhone was on shuffle.

The
 surveillance video from the RapidRide bus shows Mr Borgen grabbing 
19-year-old Travonnte Brown's gun, swinging blows at the assailant.

Thug: Trevonnte Brown, 19, is seen here walking the aisles of a Seattle bus. He robbed two people of their phones and is about to approach another victim

Fighting back: Mr Borgen grabs Brown's gun in a flash and pushes him to the back of the bus

Fellow commuters joined in, tackling the gunman to the 
ground and holding him for police.

Moments before he comes across Mr Borgen, Brown can be seen moving up the aisle of the bus, pointing his gun at passengers and stealing their cell phones. 

Chris Briggs was one of his victims. He told KOMO-TV that Brown came up behind him on the bus and poked him with his pistol and demanded Mr Briggs' hand over his cell phone.

'He jabbed me a little harder and said, "Don't make this any harder than it has to be," he told the TV station.

After
 police arrested Brown and put him in the back of a squad car, he went 
berserk and kicked out a window, officers said. He had to be transferred
 to a police van to be transported to lockup.

He is charged with two counts of first-degree robbery and one count of first-degree attempted robbery.

Several passengers pile on and pin Brown to the floor until police come
