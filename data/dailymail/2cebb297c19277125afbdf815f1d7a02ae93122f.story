Northern Territory police have seized a number of vehicles under the state's tough anti-hooning laws.

Tennant Creek police have seized a V8 Holden Commodore utility after several reports were received of it hooning on Bornite Street and Scheelite Crescent on Saturday night.

The vehicle has been seized for a mandatory 48 hours.

Under the anti-hooning legislation, anyone caught doing burnouts, donuts, drifting or other hooning behaviour could lose their vehicles, slapped with hefty fines or face 12 months imprisonment.

This Holden utility was seized by police for Hooning in Tennant Creek on Sunday

Territory Duty Superintendent Helen Braam said 'hooning is a selfish and irresponsible act.

'Deliberately losing control of your vehicle - which is what you do when you fishtail around corners - places members of the public and their property in great danger, not to mention the damage to the roadway, that our taxes pay to repair!!' Superintendent Braam said.

'The old advertisment where people would wiggle their pinkies indicating the size of a males anatomy always comes to mind when people are found hooning, obviously only relevant where the driver is a male - which it's believed was the case in this instance.'

'Once again, it's an offence to hoon – it's an offence to refuse to disclose the driver of a vehicle if it's registered to you - basically just do the right thing - it's one matter to disregard your own safety - but entirely a different matter when you disregard the safety of others.'

Vehicle sezied after a 28-year-old driver was caught allegedly doing burnout and fishtailing his car sideways

It follows after a 28-year-old male driver was caught allegedly doing a burnout while fishtailing his car sideways with smoke pouring from the rear tyres – all in front of four police officers.

The hooning act occurred around 2.45pm on Friday on Berrimah Road.

Northern Territory police have taken to their Facebook page to post confiscated vehicles and describing the act as 'selfish' after motorists were caught driving illegally.

The posts have received a significant amount of shares and comments.

'Best they seize the car BEFORE the hoon driver goes on to KILL HIMSELF OR OTHER INNOCENT PEOPLE who might just happen to be in his way!' one woman wrote.

'Should have had the car crushed!' another said.

'They should have it [car] crush and not just a word this way owners who commit this act would think twice about it.' one wrote. 

The Northern Territory Government is getting hoons off our streets. New anti-hooning laws mean that if you're caught hooning on Territory roads and in public places you could lose your car and your cash.

First Offence: Police can immediately impound your car for 48 hours every time you are detected hooning and you can be fined $220. If you are caught hooning again within a two year period:

Second Offence: The court can impound your car for a further period of between three to six months and you can receive a fine of up to $2200 or 12 months imprisonment.

Third offence: The court can forfeit and dispose of your vehicle and you can also receive a fine of up to $2200 or 12 months imprisonment.
