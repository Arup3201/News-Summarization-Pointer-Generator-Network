Two of the most powerful figures in the NHS are facing calls to resign over their roles in a scandal at a maternity unit where mothers and babies died needlessly.

Mike Farrar, a senior manager tipped to be the next head of the NHS, and the country’s chief nurse, Jane Cummings, are accused of failing to investigate unsafe care.

Up to 14 babies and two mothers are feared to have died because of poor care at Furness General Hospital since 2001, while another nine infants suffered brain damage.

Last week it emerged that three officials at the Care Quality Commission had tried to cover up evidence of a botched inspection that took place in 2010 and passed the hospital as safe. Bereaved families believe that had the watchdog thoroughly investigated the unit, subsequent deaths of babies could have been avoided.

Mr Farrar, 52, earns £200,000 a year as head of the NHS Confederation, which represents managers and hospital chief executives. He is in the running to succeed Sir David Nicholson as head of the NHS when he ‘retires early’ next year in the wake of his failings over the Mid Staffordshire scandal.

From 2007 to 2011 Mr Farrar was chief executive of North West Strategic Health Authority, which should have been supervising the hospital. He was repeatedly warned by bereaved families about unsafe care and although he commissioned three reports to investigate the unit between 2008 and 2010, he never published the findings.

Jane Cummings, who earns £130,000 per year, has also been accused of failing to intervene

He also reassured the CQC the unit was making improvements in 2010 and said there would be no need for further investigation.

Mr Farrar’s actions are now being investigated by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, which is considering whether the strategic health authority is guilty of maladministration and failed to properly supervise midwives.

His former deputy Jane Cummings, who now earns £130,000 a year as the chief nursing officer of the NHS, has also been accused of failing to intervene. She was formerly the chief nursing officer at the regional health body between 2007 and 2011, and served as deputy chief executive under Mr Farrar in her last six months.

Her role was to monitor the ‘quality performance’ of hospitals in the region and the Mail understands she should have been aware of problems at the Furness maternity unit in Barrow, part of the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust.

Last night grieving families called on the pair to consider their positions. James Titcombe, 35, the father of baby Joshua, who died at the unit in 2008 when he was nine days old, said Mr Farrar ‘has never apologised to us or acknowledged his mistakes’.

He added: ‘There was a failure of the North West Strategic Health Authority in its duty with midwifery supervision. Mr Farrar should consider his position. He has never taken responsibility for his role.’

The NHS Confederation, representing Mr Farrar, confirmed that three reviews of the maternity unit had been carried out between 2008 and 2010. It added the findings were never made public because they apparently involved the death of only one baby, Joshua Titcombe.

Mrs Cummings, 52, said: ‘I am committed to staying in my current role to support nursing.

‘What happened at Morecambe Bay was very sad and must have been awful for the families.

‘I was deputy chief executive of the North West SHA from May to October 2011. I worked with staff and stakeholders to take action over issues brought to my attention.’
