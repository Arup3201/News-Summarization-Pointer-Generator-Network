A married mother of four from Massachusetts was found lying in a pool of blood in her driveway after police say she was brutally stabbed by her husband, who yelled out, 'die, b****, die' as he was being led away in handcuffs.

The Plymouth district attorney's office says police responded to calls of a stabbing in the town of Rockland Wednesday night.

When officers arrived, they found 52-year-old Patricia Langley prostrate on the ground outside her Rockland home suffering from fatal knife wounds. Her husband, 56-year-old Richard Langley, was arrested at the scene after admitting to the stabbing.

According to court documents, Langley told police he killed his wife for cheating on him.

Domestic tragedy: Richard Langley, 56 (right) is accused of stabbing to death his wife and the mother of his children, Patricia (left) in the driveway of their home

The
 56-year-old father of four recounted how he returned home from a 
shopping trip to Walmart Wednesday and found 'sexual' text messages on 
his wife's cell phone, which caused him to fly 'off the handle.'

He confronted his wife about her alleged infidelity, but she refused to address the matter, which made Langley furious, Boston Globe reported. 

But
 during his interview with police, the man accused his slain wife of 
being the aggressor, saying that she pulled a kitchen knife on him, 
which he ultimately wrestled out of her grip and used to stab her at least
 twice.

After he allegedly 
plunged the knife into Patricia Langley's chest, Richard Langley kicked 
her as she lay bleeding in the middle of the driveway on a quiet 
suburban street. 

While 
neighbors who flocked to the scene after hearing Patricia’s screams used
 towels to stop blood from pouring from her fatal wounds, Richard 
Langley reportedly sat on the stairs puffing on a cigarette.

The court papers stated that the man repeatedly asked those around him, 'Is she dead yet?' reported Boston Herald.

Patricia Langley was begging for help and saying she could not draw a breath.

When one of the neighbors asked her who stabbed her, Richard Langley reportedly chimed in declaring, 'I did. I stabbed her.'

When
 officers responded to a 911 call, a dying Mrs Langley
 told officers: 'My husband stabbed me. He killed me.'

The woman was rushed to a hospital where she was pronounced dead.

As
 he was being handcuffed, the 56-year-old suspect once again confessed 
to the killing, telling Rockland police Sgt. Peter Chernicki, ‘I stabbed
 the b****.’

When police 
searched the couple's home, they found a pool of blood in the living 
room, where they recovered the presumed murder weapon. The family dog 
was locked in a bedroom.

Langley was ordered held without bail Thursday. He is due back in court July 11.

Plymouth District Attorney Timothy Cruz told the Patriot Ledger the stabbing death was 'one of the most vicious' cases his office has
 ever handled.

At around 7.30pm Wednesday, neighbors in the small, tight-knit community of about 17,000 heard a woman's screams coming from the driveway outside the Langley family's one-story home on Moncrief Road. 

Several nearby residents rushed to the scene, only to discover Patricia Langley lying covered in blood on the ground. They tried to stop the bleeding, but to no avail.

Police say her husband, Richard, did not attempt to flee and was standing nearby when officers arrived, boasting that he stabbed her.

Mrs Langley worked as a special education
 teacher's aide at Rockland Public Schools. The woman and her husband 
have three grownup daughters and a son.

Salt of the earth: Mrs Langley worked as a special education teacher's aide and was active in her community and church

According to Mrs Langley’s Facebook page, last month the family celebrated the graduation of one of their daughters.

Both spouses lived in the 180 block of Moncrieff Road in Rockland for at least two decades.

Richard Langley, a burly man known to everyone as Rick, worked as a general manager for a local glass company.

The couple's acquaintances in Rockland say they have never heard any sounds of fighting coming from the Langleys' home.

Patricia Langley was described by her friend and neighbor Laurie Nigro as a kind and selfless woman and a great mother who was active in the local school system, WCVB reported.
