West Ham United have made up for their transfer deadline day nightmare by announcing betting company Betway are to be their new long-term sponsors.

The Hammers confirmed the news on their Twitter page earlier today and will replace former sponsors Alpari whose UK branch was closed because of insolvency.

The Hammers confirmed last month that they search for a new sponsor had begun following the news that the currency broker was shutting down it's UK branch in the wake of the Swiss National Bank's decision to end its capping of the Swiss franc against the euro. 

A win at home to United would show the teams around them that the Hammers aren't giving up their chances of European qualification without a fight.
