Aston Villa left-back Joe Bennett is having a medical at Brighton on Wednesday ahead of a completing a deal for a season-long loan move.

Bennett, 24, was bought by Villa for around £2.75million in 2012 after impressing at Middlesbrough but found his opportunities limited last season through injury and Ryan Bertrand’s arrival on loan.

Paul Lambert’s capture of Aly Cissokho has seen Bennett look for game-time elsewhere and Sami Hyypia’s Championship side have edged ahead of rivals in pursuit of his signature.

On the move: Joe Bennett is set to join Brighton on a season-long loan from Aston Villa

Familiar face: He will join new Brighton manager Sami Hyypia on the south coast

Brighton were set to complete a deal for another left-back, Stephen Ward, last week, but Burnley stole in at the eleventh hour to sign the player.

Bennett has two years left on the Villa contract he signed two years ago, and has made 30 appearances in the Premier League for the club so far. 

He will be the fifth player to leave the club on a season-long loan this summer after Nicklas Helenius, Antonio Luna, Yacouba Sylla and Aleksandar Tonev

VIDEO Lambert delighted with team effort
