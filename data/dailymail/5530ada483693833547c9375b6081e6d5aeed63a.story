Yes, it's a bank holiday. And yet believe it or not, it could also be the hottest day of the year so far.

Forecasters predict it will be the warmest May bank holiday in years as temperatures in places pass 23C (73F) – eclipsing France and Italy.

Despite our tradition of rather disappointing bank holiday weather, MeteoGroup forecaster Billy Payne said: 'It was getting warmer throughout the weekend and today there is potential for it to be the hottest day of the year so far.

'There will be longer intervals of 
sunshine as well, with East Anglia, East Midlands, Lincolnshire and 
London getting the best of it.' Tesco expects to have sold one million 
sausages and 28million bottles of beer over the weekend.

The warmest temperature so far this year was 23.1C (73.5F), in Faversham, Kent, on April 25.

Sadly the fine weather won't last.  
The Met Office's three-month forecast says May is likely to be colder 
than average because of chilly winds blowing across cold seas.

June and July could also be cooler and
more unsettled than usual, threatening the tennis at Wimbledon and 
Glastonbury music festival.

Today's good weather comes as the 
Environment Agency is warning  that at least 55 of our most popular 
bathing sites will fail to meet new EU water cleanliness standards.

The rain and the hail added to the tonnes of mud on site as the course lived up to its name. Participants braved muddy trenches, and waist-high swamps

The course was designed by British Special Forces. On average, only 78 per cent of participants finish the course, while average time is 2.5 hours

The course features a 12-15 mile trail run, containing more than 20 military-style obstacles

The regulations that will decide 
whether a beach is fit for swimming are up to twice as strict as current
rules and come into force in 2015.

Resorts likely to be ruled too 
polluted for bathing include Lyme Regis in Dorset, Blackpool in 
Lancashire and Southsea in Hampshire.

Malcolm Bell, the head of Visit 
Cornwall, where several beaches are at risk, said: 'We are going to face
a challenge to explain to people that things have not got worse, it is 
just that the hurdle is higher.'

While the south of the country will continue to bask in the blazing heat tomorrow, it is likely to remain cloudy with outbursts of rain in the north east and Scotland

Yesterday saw a warm start to the Bank Holiday with temperatures reaching 18C in Lincolnshire and 18.3C in Cambridge.

Today will see another sunny day in many parts with temperatures set to soar to 20C across southern England and Wales. But areas in the north of England and Scotland will remain cloudy with showery intervals.

A Met Office spokesman said: 'Today will see temperatures reach up to 20C in some parts of the country with London, East Anglia and Lincolnshire enjoying the warmest weather.

'Further west and in the north it will be much cooler with the possibility of rain in some parts.

'Overnight there's a chance of coastal fog across the Channel which may cause a misty start for people living in the east of England. This should clear throughout the day on Monday.

'Temperatures will reach highs of 23C, possibly even 24C in some parts, which will make Monday the hottest day of the year so far. The current record this year is 23.1C on April 25.'

Britain's cherry lovers can look forward to a bumper crop of their favourite fruit this year, a new report showed yesterday.

Despite the cold spring weather delaying the cherry season, the quality of the fruit is likely to be excellent, according to the latest research.

Trade magazine The Grocer reports that Mansfields, the UK's biggest cherry grower, is expecting a major increase in fruit volumes from its Kent orchards to around 700 tonnes after last year's crop was hit severely by the wet weather.

A Co-operative Farms spokesman added: 'A good winter chill has meant blossom is only just coming out which is a good thing as the frost-susceptible period is shorter.'

Coupled with high soil moisture content and a dry summer, it would result in a good fruit size at harvest, he added.

This
year's sunny Bank Holiday is a big improvement on last 
year, which saw rain and a temperature high of 16C (60.8F) at Exeter 
Airport.

But the warm weather is not expected to last with rain moving in from the west from Tuesday.

The rain may not reach the south east of the country until late in the day, meaning the region may enjoy one more day of sunshine.

The wet weather is expected to remain until Friday when it begins to clear.

The short heatwave comes after a miserable start to Spring and has seen a surge in demand for barbecues, with Asda reporting a sales increase of 142 per cent while Marks and Spencer report sales of its barbecue range 'The Grill' are expected to double on last year.

Meanwhile Superdrug has reported an increased demand for beauty products such as false toe nails, wax strips and fake tan.

Hay fever sufferers have also been warned about a steady rise in the pollen count as the weather heats up, with tomorrow expected to be the worst day.

Alexander Burkill of the Met Office said tree pollen would be more significant than grass pollen until the middle of May.
