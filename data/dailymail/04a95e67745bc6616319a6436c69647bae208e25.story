Facebook has confirmed it is placing clickable warnings over extreme 'graphic' content on its site.

The warnings, which are placed over flagged images and videos, state that the content might 'shock offend and upset'.

The move comes after the Californian social media site came under fire for failing to impose greater controls on disturbing images.

The warning asks the user 'are you sure you want to see this?'. 

Content with the warning will not be seen by users under 18 and videos will also not autoplay like other newsfeed items.

Videos to come under the new measures include footage of the death of French policeman, Ahmed Merabet, who was shot in Paris during the Charlie Hebdo attacks.

'A photo or video containing graphic content may appear with a warning to let people know about the content before they view it, and may only be visible to people older than 18,' Facebook said.

Facebook has confirmed the scheme has been rolled out on its site since December.

'When people share things on Facebook, we expect that they will share it responsibly, including choosing who will see that content,' a spokeswoman told the BBC.

'We also ask that people warn their audience about what they are about to see if it includes graphic violence.'

As well as changes to graphic content warnings, Facebook said today said it will begin firing off police-sanctioned 'Amber Alerts' to members of the leading social network to help locate children who have been abducted or gone missing.

Alerts including pictures and details about missing children and their possible abductors will appear in news feeds of Facebook members in areas where those being sought might be found, according to the social network's trust and safety manager Emily Vacher.

Facebook members sharing the news will be able to link to relevant information at the website of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which issues Amber Alerts at the behest of police

The Amber Alert warning system was started after the 1996 kidnapping and murder of 9-year-old Amber Hagerman in Arlington, Texas. 

Since then, more than 700 children have been found as a direct result of the alerts. The alerts are issued over TV and radio, on highway signs, as text messages and over the Internet. 

But one psychologist said the current measure did not go far enough to protect young people.

Dr Arthur Cassidy, who runs a branch of the Yellow Ribbon Program suicide-prevention charity, is calling for an outright ban on graphic clips.

He told the BBC that many children used the service and they could work around the new restrictions.

Currently, Facebook only allows children 13 years or older to be members. 

However, many can get around this rule by giving false details.

It is unclear whether changes will be made to the warnings, and Facebook did not immediately respond to the Dailymail.com.

The site has long faced criticism for what has been described as an 'overly complex' response to disturbing content.

Its policy states it would ban any content 'shared for sadistic pleasure or to celebrate or glorify violence'.

In 2013, it placed warnings over clips of beheadings, but the scheme was not rolled out across the entire site. 

The measure was later reversed.

Later that year, the group bowed to pressure from child internet protection campaigners by taking down a graphic video of a woman being beheaded in Mexico.

They had accused Facebook of irresponsibility after it lifted a ban on users posting videos of beheadings - and demanded the social networking site explain its decision to parents.

Critics accused the firm of 'taking leave of its senses'. 

Facebook said at the time that while the images must not be posted for 'sadistic pleasure' they should be available for those who wish to condemn them.
