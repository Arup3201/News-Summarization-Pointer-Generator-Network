The driver of an out-of-control monster truck that charged through a crowd of spectators in Mexico killing nine people has been charged with manslaughter.

Francisco Velazquez, 51, who appeared before a judge in a Chihuahua state court wearing a neck brace, listened to the names of the nine victims as they were read out in court. One of the victims died in hospital during the hearing.

He told the court that during the show on Saturday, he had been knocked unconscious inside the truck's cabin.

Out of bounds: At the Extreme Aeroshow in Chihuahua, Mexico Saturday, a monster truck driver lost control of his vehicle and drove into a crowd of spectators

Body count: At least 8 are dead after the tragic accident. Twelve remained in intensive care Sunday

Lost control: Witnesses say they saw the driver bang his head and lose his helmet before driving into the crowd

'I was driving to one side and then I 
turned around and drove to the other side, my helmet came off and I hit 
my head and lost consciousness. I wasn't conscious when the truck fell,'
 he said.

Prosecutor Gerardo
 Carbajal said: 'He didn't meet the age and health requirements needed 
to be part of the show,' but he didn't say what those requirements are.

Organisers of the event have said hundreds of people gathered without permission in the pit area of a makeshift arena in a park.

Veteran
 monster truck show organisers said spectators should never have been 
standing that close to the arena floor unprotected, regardless of the 
trajectory of the truck.

They
 said properly organised shows take place in an arena with a safety zone
 separating spectators from the trucks, which the Chihuahua city show 
lacked.

Authorities have made no other arrests in the case.

Chaos: Injured people are treated during the panic that ensued following Saturday's horrific tragedy

Aftermath: Horrified family and friends of victims search the crowd for their loved ones. On Sunday, 12 people remained in intensive care with four in critical condition

Video taken from the stands by spectator Krizthall Martinez shows the truck making an initial pass over two cars.

It
 then makes a second pass at higher speed, coming down sharply nose 
first and bouncing violently before piling straight into the crowd, 
which stood directly in the path of the monster truck unprotected by any
 wall or barrier.

Spectator Daniel Dominguez, 18, said he 
was happily watching the show with a group of relatives when the truck 
came down hard in the middle of the cars.

‘The driver hit his head and his helmet flew off,’ Dominguez said. ‘The truck came directly at where we were.’

Dominguez's 11-year-old sister was taken into surgery for injuries to her legs, and his mother was also treated for minor contusions.

The governor of the Mexican state declared three days of mourning to honour victims.

The three-day show, which included performances by airplanes, the monster truck acts and other events, was cancelled after the accident on its second day in a park on the outskirts of Chihuahua, the capital of Chihuahua state..

Path of destruction: Initially, the mayor of Chihuahua announced that 47 people had been injured in the accident, but that number has now grown to more than 70

Locked in: Authorities are also investigating whether a mechanical error might have happened with the truck, causing the gas pedal to remain engaged

On Sunday, two armed men threw a 
firebomb at monster trucks and other vehicles parked at a hotel that 
were part of an unrelated monster truck production at the air show.

Chihuahua
 Gov. Cesar Duarte Juarez said his administration, which was listed as a
 sponsor of the air show, was investigating whether Civil Protection 
authorities had correctly enforced safety regulations.

He and other officials didn't say if those regulations required any protective barrier for spectators.

Some
 witnesses said the driver appeared to have hit his head on the interior
 of the truck, which is nicknamed ‘Big Show,’ as he drove over the old 
cars. At least two reported seeing the driver's helmet come off before 
the huge vehicle drove into the crowd of terrified spectators, who tried
 to flee.

‘I fell over, and 
when I turned around I saw the tire very close. It hit me and threw me 
to the other side,’ Jesus Manuel Ibarra, 41, said as he was treated for 
injuries to his arm and hip.

Six people were killed at the scene of 
the truck show Saturday, and another three people died receiving medical
 attention. Four bodies were found under the monster truck's
 wheels.

Chihuahua Mayor 
Marco Quezada said 79 people had been hurt. Twelve remained in intensive
 care, with four in critical condition, he said.

In custody: The monster truck driver survived the crash and was arrested Sunday on suspicions of manslaughter. Tests indicated he may have been drinking

Over: The airshow was cancelled after the accident

Medical attention: An injured spectator being airlifted out of the monster truck show yesterday

Gonzalez,
 the prosecutor's spokesman, said investigators were looking into the 
possibility of a mechanical failure that left Velazquez unable to 
release the gas pedal.

Several
 witnesses said, however, that the driver appeared to have become 
incapacitated after striking his head as he bounced over small cars at 
high speed, crushing their roofs.
