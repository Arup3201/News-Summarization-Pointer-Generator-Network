When they were hellraising as one of the Swinging Sixties’ most glamorous couples, they are unlikely to have given much thought to what they’d be doing 50 years later.

But those decades have passed and, while most people will have noticed that Mick Jagger is still  strutting the stage, fewer will realise that his old flame Marianne Faithfull is too.

Admittedly Miss Faithfull, who shot to fame in 1964 with her version of the Rolling Stones song As Tears Go By, is confined to rather more modest  venues than Jagger. The Stones have been playing to sell-out crowds at five hugely lucrative concerts to celebrate their 50th anniversary.

Strutting her stuff: Marianne Faithfull on stage in show in Austria; Marianne is appearing at the Landesteater in Linz Austria in a ballet called seven deadly sins

She, meanwhile, is playing the lead role in Bertolt Brecht’s ballet The Seven Deadly Sins at a theatre in Linz, Austria – backed by male dancers dressed only in leather shorts.

While Jagger, 69, is playing to fans who have paid up to £1,000, tickets for Miss Faithfull’s ballet start at £9.70.

The singer, who turns 66 later this month, admits performing has become a necessary struggle – but is worried she would become ‘bored and lonely’ in retirement.

She dated Jagger for four years and after they split in 1970 she attempted suicide and spiralled into heroin addiction and poverty, ending up sleeping rough in Soho.

In 1979 she released a comeback album, Broken English, which established her as a formidable musical force. She has been recording and performing ever since, most recently with Jarvis Cocker and Nick Cave.

But Miss Faithfull, who will celebrate 50 years in music with a world tour in 2014, confessed that performing has become more difficult with age.

‘It is a struggle,’ she said. ‘I find songwriting much harder than I used to. But I still have more to say. And I still work for my living.’

Five years ago she admitted that she had never saved any money for her old age. ‘The problem with living life as if there is no tomorrow is that you get to this age and realise it isn’t true,’ she said.

It is not a problem Jagger is likely to have. He, along with the rest of the Stones, is expected to net around £4million from the five concerts.

Back in the day: Marianne Faithfull and Mick Jagger had, and still have, a strong stage presence

And while he appeared far younger than his years on stage at the O2 arena in London, Miss Faithfull’s endless performing seems to have taken its toll.

The singer suffered a severe cold last month, which forced her to miss one  of her shows in Linz. She struggled through the next performance, coughing and appearing a little unsteady.

At one point, one of her dancers handed her a glass of water so she could clear her throat.

Another had to support her during the ovation to make sure that she did not stumble.
