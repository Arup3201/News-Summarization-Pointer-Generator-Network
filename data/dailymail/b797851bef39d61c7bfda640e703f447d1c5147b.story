A photographer who shared an image of a 13-year-old boy from Brooklyn on his website has helped to raise more than $1.2 million for a public school located in New York City's most dangerous and crime-ridden location - and earned his young subject a meeting with President Barack Obama in the process.

Last month, Humans of New York creator Brandon Stanton was in Brooklyn's Brownsville neighborhood when he ran into Vidal Chastanet and asked him to participate in his online photography project, which involves him sharing candid shots of New Yorkers, along with a personal quote from the person about the life.

And after the Mott Hall Bridges Academy student named his principal, Nadia Lopez, as the most influential person in his life, explaining that she made he and his fellow students ‘feel like they matter’, Mr Stanton was inspired to start an online fundraiser to help Ms Lopez send her students on a class trip to Harvard University – a campaign which has since become so popular that it has even caught the attention of President Obama.

Chance meeting: Vidal Chastanet, 13, told Humans of New York creator Brandon Stanton, 30, that his principal, Nadia Lopez, was the most influential person in his life

'When we get in trouble, she doesn't suspend us,' Vidal said of his Principal when he was first interviewed by Mr Stanton. 'She calls us to her office and explains to us how society was built down around us. And she tells us that each time somebody fails out of school, a new jail cell gets built.'

He added: 'And one time she made every student stand up, one at a time, and she told each one of us that we matter.'

Since posting those words on his website, Mr Stanton has seen his campaign hit headlines around the world, resulting in a slew of donations and a wealth of public interest, including a , Vidal, Ms Lopez and Mr Stanton were invited to the Oval Office where they sat down with President Barack Obama and shared with him their amazing story.

Life-changing moment: Mr Stanton photographed President Obama as he had a one-on-one talk with Vidal and offered him some personal advice

Amazing advice: The President told Vidal to never be afraid to ask for help because 'everybody always needs support'

'Ms. Lopez always said that there was no place her students did not belong,' Mr Stanton posted on his blog, alongside a photo from the trio’s trip to the White House. 'Recently we received an invitation that proved just that.'

Another picture taken by Mr Stanton shows President Obama speaking with Vidal.

According to the website, the President told the youngster: 'You don’t do things alone. Nobody does things alone. Everybody always needs support. For a young man like you, you should never be too afraid or too shy to look for people who can encourage you or mentor you.’

Earlier in the week, when Vidal, Ms Lopez and Mr Stanton appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres Show, Ms Lopez explained that before she read Vidal's words and learned of the Mr Stanton’s campaign, she had felt like she was starting to burn out and was slowly losing faith in her work.

'I was in a place that I was broken, and I think every educator gets there,' she told Ellen. 'You give so much, you put in long hours, and I literally went home and I broke down and cried and told my mother I couldn't do it anymore.'

Ms Lopez added: '[My mom told me] that "God placed you in that school for a reason”. And then Monday, when I read [Vidal's words], I couldn't even believe it that he thought enough of me.'

After hearing their story, Ellen announced that Target would outfit every classroom in Ms Lopez's school with state-of-the-art technology and give similar grants, totaling $100,000, to other schools in the area.

Since launching the campaign on January 22, Mr Stanton’s IndieGoGo page has received more than 50,000 donations – resulting in enough money to send Mott Hall’s sixth graders on their Harvard trip every year for the next decade.

All of which, Mr Stanton explains, was inspired by Vidal and Ms Lopez’s determination to improve the lives of the people around them.

'Since many of her scholars have never left New York, [Miss Lopez] wants them to know what it feels like to stand on the campus of one of the world's top schools, and know that they belong,' Mr Stanton wrote on his blog. 

'She thinks the experience will broaden their horizons and expand their idea of their own potential.’

When Mr Stanton spoke with Ms Lopez last month, she explained the importance of setting goals for her students who are growing up in Brownsville.

Large audience: Mr Stanton (pictured) photographs and interviews everyday people he meets on the street. Nearly 50,000 people have made donations to Vidal's school since the campaign started on January 22

Perfect timing: Ms Lopez admitted that before she read Vidal's words, she was ready to give up, explaining that she was feeling 'broken'

'This is a neighborhood that doesn't necessarily expect much from our children, so at Mott Hall Bridges Academy we set our expectations very high,' she said. 'We don't call the children "students", we call them "scholars".’

She added: 'When you tell people you're from Brownsville, their face cringes up. But there are children here that need to know that they are expected to succeed.'

During an assembly last week, Lopez announced to her students that more that $700,000 had been raised by the campaign, a number which has since almost been doubled. 

She explained that the donations will be used for the school's Harvard trips, summer programs and a scholarship fund named after Vidal. The 13-year-old will also be its first recipient.
