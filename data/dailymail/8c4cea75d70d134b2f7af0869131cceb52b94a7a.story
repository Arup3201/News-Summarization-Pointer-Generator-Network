Book ban: Parents in Alabama want to remove The Complete Book of Pregnancy and Childbirth

Parents in Alabama are seeking to ban a book on pregnancy and childbirth from a high school because they claim it displays 'pornographic' drawings illustrating how to have sex while pregnant.  

Teresa Offord, library media specialist at B.B. Comer High in Talladega County, told The Anniston Star that a parent petitioned the county to remove The Complete Book 
of Pregnancy and Childbirth by Shelia Kitzinger.

Offord said the book was moved to a reference section and only students with 
parental permission were allowed to check it out.

But a new investigation by the newspaper along with journalism students from the University of Alabama proves that this is only the tip of the iceberg.

The team collected challenge forms from the past five years from each of the
state's public school district's to determine how many books were being
banned.

Out of 132 districts, nine reported challenges, 77 reported no challenges - and 46 provided no information.

But Barbara Jones, director of the American Library Association's Office 
of Intellectual Freedom, says that only about 20 percent of all book challenges are typically reported - because librarians and school officials are afraid to lose their jobs.

'Transparency is important for democracy,' Jones told the paper. 'School are no different. We need to know what's going on.'

The pregnancy book is only the latest in a long list of books that have been targeted for removal in libaries around the country.

Important works of literature such as The
Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank, praised for its insight into the 
impact of the Second World War on children, was banned by a Virginia 
school over the 'sexual content and homosexual themes' when the 
definitive edition was released in 2010.

IN 1983, Alabama's State Texbook Committee propsed banning the book because it was 'a real downer'.

In 2010, a California school banned the 10th edition of the Merriam-Webster 
Dictionary because it included a definition for 'oral sex'.

People for the American Way reports that school and public library books 
are among the most visible targets and are frequently challenged for 
various reasons. 

The organization claims that between 1990 and 2000, there were 6,364 challenges reported to or 
recorded by the Office for Intellectual Freedom, and 71per cent targeted materials in schools or public libraries.
