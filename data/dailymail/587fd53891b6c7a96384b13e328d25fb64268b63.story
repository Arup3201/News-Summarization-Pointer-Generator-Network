An explosion killed the leader of
one of Syria's most powerful Islamist insurgent groups, Ahrar
al-Sham, on Tuesday, with some eyewitnesses saying it was the work of a suicide bomber.

At least 28 of the group's commanders were also wiped out in the blast, according to an organisation that
monitors violence in the civil war.

Ahrar al-Sham is a hardline Islamist group and part of the
Islamic Front alliance that has been in armed conflict with Isis, also known as the Islamic State, and the regime of Bashar Assad.

An explosion killed Hassan Aboud, the leader of one of Syria's most powerful Islamist insurgent groups Ahraral-Sham, along with 28 of its commanders, during a meeting in Idlib

Location: The blast occurred in Idlib province, northwest Syria

A statement posted on Ahrar al-Sham's official Twitter feed
said the blast had hit a meeting in Idlib province in northwest
Syria and confirmed Hassan Aboud, the group's leader, among at
least 12 dead.

'We don't know the cause of the explosion yet,' Abu Mustafa
al-Absi, a member of Ahrar al-Sham's politburo told Al-Jazeera
TV in an interview. 'We do not rule out the infiltration of
elements who were able to plant a bomb,' he added.

However, a statement released by the group said the leaders had 'died through a car bomb'.

A spokesman for Ahrar al-Sham  that Hashem al-Sheik Abu Jaber would assume overall leadership of the group, while Abu Saleh Tahan would fill the role of military chief.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the monitoring
group, said some 50 of the group's leaders had been gathered at
a house when the blast went off. Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the
Observatory, said the blast had occurred inside the meeting.

Ahrar al-Sham, which is widely believed to have received
funding from Gulf states, aims to implement Islamic sharia law
in Syria. It was at one point considered the strongest insurgent
group in the Syrian civil war.

Its views are more moderate than Isis. In June Aboud condemned Isis in an interview with the BBC.

He said: 'Isis does not reflect Islam in any way. Islam is a religion of peace. It is not a religion of slaughter. Isis represents the worst image ever of Islam.'

Syrian state TV flashed an urgent news headline reporting
Aboud's death.

Syria descended into civil war after an uprising against
President Bashar al-Assad's rule in 2011. The United Nations
recently put the death toll above 191,000 people.

In January another senior Ahrar al-Sham leader, Abu Khaled
al-Soury, was killed in a suicide attack. Soury had fought
alongside al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden and was close to its
current chief Ayman al-Zawahiri.

Al-Zawahiri recently announced that Al Qaeda has expanded into the Indian subcontinent. He said in a video statement that a regional group had been formed that he vowed would bring Islamic law to the region and 'wage jihad against its enemies.' 

Some analysts saw the announcement, which showed al-Zawahiri speaking in front of a dark curtain, as an effort to revive the fortunes of Al Qaeda, which has been largely eclipsed, at least publicly, by the Islamic State. 

Tonight President Barack Obama will address the nation in a televised address from the White House and outline his plans to confront Isis.

Isis was kicked out of Al Qaeda in February for ignoring al-Zawahiri’s insistence that it restrict its activities to Iraq’s borders.

The separation, however, far from diminishing the group, marked the start of its terrifying expansion.

Over the past few months it has rampaged across Iraq and Syria, capturing dozens of towns and strategic positions, killing hundreds of civilians and waging a well-organised online propaganda war.

Its ranks have been bolstered by hundreds of fighters from Yemen, Libya, Saudi Arabia and Western nations such as Britain, America and Australia.

Al Qaeda has been side-lined as a result, jihadists seemingly far more impressed by Isis’ leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and his brutal confrontations with those people deemed to be ‘Un-Islamic’ than al-Zawahiri, who hasn’t been able to dictate events in recent years.

However, the West ignores Al Qaeda at its peril. The terrorist organisation still has strongholds in eastern Libya, Syria and the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt and has significant alliances with the likes of the Taliban in Afghanistan.
