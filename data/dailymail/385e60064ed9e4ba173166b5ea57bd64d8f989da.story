The 16-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot at point blank range by the Taliban because of her unswerving campaign for education says she hopes to be her country's prime minister one day.

Brave Malala Yousafzai, who has made an astonishing recovery since being shot in the head, refuses to be daunted by the terrorists who tried to assassinate her.

She revealed her political aspirations just hours after she was awarded Europe's top human rights prize and on the eve of the announcement for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, for which she was a strong contender but lost out to chemical weapons watchdog OPCW.

Malala Yousafzai, who was among the favourites to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, says terrorists cannot kill her dream of better rights for women

In an interview with CNN, Malala said she had initially wanted to be a doctor but later learned she could help more people through becoming prime minister of Pakistan.

'I can spend much of the budget on education,' Malala said to applause and laughter as she sat next to her father, human rights activist Ziauddin Yousafzai, the founder of a girls' school in Pakistan.

Malala recounted the moment she was shot while sitting in the back of a vehicle travelling home from school and reiterated that she was not intimidated by threats to her life.

'I'm never going to give up,' Malala said when asked about repeated death threats made by the Taliban.

'They only shot a body but they cannot shoot my dreams.'

On October 9 last year a masked gunman jumped into a pick-up truck taking a group of girls home from school and shouted 'who is Malala?' before shooting her in the head.

Her father asked his brother-in-law to prepare a coffin for her funeral but Malala was flown to the UK and woke up a week later at a hospital in Birmingham. Following treatment she gradually regained her sight and voice.

Malala said her first thought after finding herself in Britain was of two friends she was with who were also injured in the callous attack.

'If I was shot that was fine for me but I was feeling guilty that they have been the target,' she said.

The world's reaction to her attempted murder led to the creation of the Malala Fund, which campaigns for girls' education around the world.

She has since received multiple awards including the prestigious Sakharov Prize for free speech, which is awarded by the European Parliament annually in memory of Soviet physicist and dissident Andrei Sakharov. Previous winners include South Africa's Nelson Mandela and Burma's Aung San Suu Kyi.

Earlier this week the Pakistan Taliban repeated their threat to kill Malala as well as attack any bookshops which decide to stock her new memoir 'I Am Malala', which was published on Tuesday.

Shahidullah Shahid, a spokesman for the terrorists, told the Dawn newspaper in Pakistan: 'Malala abandoned Islam for secularism for which she is being given awards.

'The Taliban will not lose an opportunity to kill Malala Yousafzai and those who were found selling her book will be targeted.'

Malala's failed assassination attempt has also drawn international attention to the struggle for women's rights within Pakistan.

Malala addressed the United Nations on her 16th birthday, and she expects to meet the Queen later this month.

The Nobel Peace Prize committee had a record 259 candidates, including 50 organisations, that were nominated this year.

Undaunted: Malala Yousufzai believes she could help more people as prime minister

Before she lost out, humble Malala said it would be a 'great honour and more than I deserve' to win the accolade, but insisted she had more to do before she could feel she has truly earned it.

'I need to work a lot,' she said.

Malala's father said he did not regret how outspoken his only daughter has been growing up, including when she first started blogging and speaking out against the denial of education to young girls in Pakistan's Swat Valley.

'I will never put my head into the yoke of slavery,' he said.

Malala spoke passionately against forced marriage and the denial of education to girls and boys throughout the world.

She urged young girls in the developed world to take advantage of their education - and to do their homework and be kind to their teachers.

'I would like to tell all the girls: realise its importance before it is snatched from you,' she said.

Malala lives with her family in Birmingham. She said that while in Pakistan she liked to listen to Justin Beiber, but now longs for the Pashto music of her homeland.
