Calling for change: Professor John Kay said cash bonuses for executives should be scrapped to end the culture of short-term profit in the City

Cash bonuses for executives should be scrapped to help end the culture of short-term profit in the City, according to a Government-backed review.

The report also questions whether the directors of large companies should be paid any bonuses at all.

Professor John Kay, from the London School of Economics, said: ‘Many people doing responsible and demanding jobs – Cabinet ministers, judges, surgeons, research scientists – do not receive bonuses, and would be insulted by the suggestion that the prospects of bonuses would encourage them to perform their duties more conscientiously.’

But he stops short of demanding an end to boardroom bonuses altogether.

Instead, the review recommends all bonuses should be paid in shares that can be cashed in only once an executive has retired.

The Kay report is a key plank of attempts by Business Secretary Vince Cable to overhaul the financial sector. Mr Cable has already unveiled reforms aimed at giving investors more say on excessive rewards.

The report found ‘short-termism’ is strangling growth in the UK economy by starving it of investment as executives seek to bump up their bonuses with quick profits, through risky takeovers or cost-cutting,  regardless of the long-term consequences.

Executive bonuses were unusual in the UK until the 1980s, Professor Kay said, when incentive schemes started to become increasingly common.

Most bonus schemes encourage chief executives to make decisions that will boost profit in the short-run, even if they have negative effects in the longer term, he added.

The failed banks RBS and HBoS were 
‘characterised by acute short-termism’ in the run-up to their collapse 
and bailout by taxpayers, Professor Kay said.

Public
outrage over multi-million pound banker bonuses soared after a series 
of scandals scarred the finance sector, including the systems failure at
RBS, money-laundering at HSBC and the Libor rate-rigging debacle.

'Hanging bankers at the end of the street' will not help solve the economy’s problems, Tony Blair said last night.

Defending free market principles, the former prime minister warned against increased state intervention and the desire for revenge.

He insisted public anger should not lead to a reversal of reforms started by Margaret Thatcher.

‘Don’t take 30 years of liberalisation, beginning under Mrs Thatcher, and say this is what caused the financial crisis,’ he said.

Mr Blair, who is an adviser to the investment bank  JP Morgan, said: ‘We must not go back to the state running everything.

‘We must regain the basic values of what society is about. We’re not against wealth, but we are in favour of social responsibility.’

Mr Blair, who stepped down five years ago, is thought to be on an annual income of £20million.

He also has a role with insurer Zurich.

Former Barclays boss Bob Diamond, who quit over the Libor scandal, was forced to waive his £20million golden goodbye.

However he is still walking away with around £2million, on top of a total of around £120million he pocketed from the bank since the credit crunch began in 2007.

Unprecedented pay revolts  have rocked a number of companies in this year’s so-called Shareholder Spring, including insurance company Aviva, media group Trinity Mirror, and drugs firm AstraZeneca.

‘It is great John Kay has raised the question of why executives need any bonus,’ said Deborah Hargreaves, of the High Pay Centre.

‘They already receive a very generous level of basic pay and they should be making their maximum effort anyway, without needing a further incentive.

‘Would they really get out of bed two hours later if they did not have the prospect of a bonus?’

But Professor Kay’s proposals are likely to be met with stiff resistance in boardrooms and the Confederation of British Industry has given them a lukewarm reception.

‘Executive pay should always be linked squarely to good performance over a meaningful period of time, but it is for individual companies to decide their own pay strategy,’ said Matthew Fell, director for competitive markets.

Previous attempts to rein in boardroom pay have failed to curb the tide of excess.

Mr Cable aims to respond to the review later this year.
