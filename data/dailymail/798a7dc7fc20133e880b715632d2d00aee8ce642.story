A Northern Ireland-based company was the supplier of halal food found to contain traces of pork DNA, it was revealed today.

Food distributor 3663 said McColgan Quality Foods Limited supplied a 'very small number of halal savoury beef pastry products' that contained pork traces to prisons.

The company said all halal products from the manufacturer had been withdrawn from supply.

Northern-Ireland based company McColgan Quality Food Ltd has been revealed as the distributor of the halal pastry products that contained pork

The consumption of pork is forbidden under Islamic law.

In a statement the company said: '3663 
would like to clarify that the very small number of halal savoury beef 
pastry products that have been withdrawn from supply were only ever 
distributed to custodial establishments.

'The products in question are from one particular food manufacturer, McColgan Quality Foods Limited, and have not been distributed to any other customer.'

The Ministry of Justice said 3663 has not been suspended, but a 'sub-contractor' has been.

3663 has said it was 'shocked', and described as 'wholly unacceptable' the discovery that some of the halal products it supplied were found to contain pork DNA due to McColgan Quality Foods being accredited by the Halal Food Authority.

According to buynifood.com, a website devoted to the produce of Northern Ireland, McColgan Quality Foods - based in Strabane, County Tyrone - is said to be 'approved for the preparation of halal product'.

The 'halal' beef pastries were supplied to prisons but have since been withdrawn

The website lists among McColgan customers popular supermarket brands including Lidl, Spar and Costcutter.

A spokesman for McColgan's said the company is proactively cooperating' with the Food Standards Agency.

In
a statement he added: 'McColgan's has already taken swift measures to 
identify, isolate and withdraw all of the products which are supplied to
The Prison Service while an investigation to determine the 
circumstances surrounding this deeply regrettable and unforeseen 
incident takes place.

'McColgan's is keen to stress that at 
no point has pork of any kind been included in the recipes of any of the
halal-certified products it supplies.'

3663
is currently contracted to distribute a wide range of products 
including ambient, frozen, fresh and chilled foods to the MoJ, all 
sourced from fully accredited and approved manufacturers and producers.

Following the horse meat scandal, 3663 
recognised a potential connection between a halal beef producer 
mentioned within the FSAI (Food Safety Authority of Ireland) report and a
supplier of halal savoury beef pastry products stocked for the MoJ.

3663 informed the MoJ of the potential connection as a precautionary measure, then took the decision that these halal savoury beef pastry products should be quarantined to prevent their use pending DNA testing.
