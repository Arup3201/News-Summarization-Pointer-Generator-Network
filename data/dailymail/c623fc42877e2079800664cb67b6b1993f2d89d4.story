Gary Lineker gave best friend Richard King a wedding to remember earlier this month by putting together an impressive video filled with famous face all claiming they have no idea who the groom is.

After being selected as King's best man, Lineker began putting together the comical clip with the likes of Pele, Diego Maradona, Jose Mourinho and Amir Khan all starring in cameo roles as they play along with Lineker's joke.

Celebrities and sports stars past and present all pretend to rather rudely have never heard of Lineker's friend despite different suggestions from the man asking the questions.

Mourinho is the first face to feature in the video, which was presumeably played before Lineker's best man speech.

With a completely straight face, the Chelsea boss says: 'Good wishes, yes. But who is Richard King? He knows me, maybe, yes but I don't him.'

King's existence is then jokingly questioned by Rio Ferdinand and Olympic hero Matthew Pinsent, who claims to have 'never heard of him' despite the Lineker's claims that he was 'in the boat in Barcelona when you won the gold medal.'

The award for most deadpan denial of the clip may go to Chelsea captain John Terry, who looks complelety bemused when asked to send King his best wishes.

Lineker, who clearly spent months putting the video together, saves the best till last as football icons Pele and Diego Maradona appear to jump on the 'who is Richard King?' bandwagon.

'I don't know him. I am the King,' says Brazilian legend Pele before Maradona simply adds 'Richard King? No.'

Who the f**k is Richard King? He is the groom with the greatest best man in the world, that’s who he is. Gary Lineker’s friend and business partner, King, got married at the weekend and the former England striker was there by his side. 

And just to prove how much of a great kind of guy he is, he made this brilliant video as part of his best man’s speech to humiliate, and delight, the groom.

When your friend gets Pele and Maradona to appear in your wedding video you know you’re doing something right with your life.
