The top-to-toe bandages protect Isla's skin from allergens

A little girl has such severe allergies that even a kiss could prove deadly.

Isla Franks, six, suffers such severe reactions that she is wrapped in bandages from the neck down for 24 hours a day, to protect her super-sensitive skin.

Her condition is so severe that she had to be rushed to hospital after her little sister gave her a kiss - hours after she had drunk a glass of milk.

Her parents have to keep her clothes in a freezer instead of a wardrobe - because of her extreme reaction to dust mites.

Isla was diagnosed with extreme 
allergies to eggs, milk, wheat, grass and dust when she was just six 
months old - and her parents told she would have to be wrapped in bandages to protect her skin.

Isla has a special cupboard for her food to stop it coming into contact with anything else.

Her
 mother Katy, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs, said: 'We can’t do the things
 that other families can - even something as normal as going out for 
dinner could be deadly for Isla.

'If
 anything Isla is allergic to so much as brushes past her skin, she 
comes up in a huge angry rash which is really painful for her.

'And if it goes anywhere near her face, her throat will start to swell. She has so many allergies, it’s difficult to keep her away from them.' 

The schoolgirl struggles to live a normal life - and is regularly sent home from school after suffering from flare ups.

Last
 month, she suffered a reaction after sitting next to a school friend 
who owned a cat - revealing another allergy for her worried parents to 
add to the list.

Mrs Franks added: 'We noticed that 
something wasn’t right when Isla was six months old - she stopped 
sleeping properly and was really grumpy.

'Her skin would flare up so badly that people even stopped me in the supermarket and asked if I had burned her.

'The
 hospital carried out all sorts of tests, and discovered she was 
allergic to eggs, milk, wheat, dust and grass - we were devastated.

'We were told she had to wear bandages to cover her skin from the neck down to stop her skin flaring up.

'When her skin gets particularly bad,
 Isla has to have a layer of wet bandages, to cool her skin, over her 
usual layer of dry bandages, which she has to wear 24 hours a day.

'Isla doesn’t know any different from having the bandages on, but they do irritate her. I have to sleep with her at night now to stop her scratching in her sleep, and pulling them off.

'There are a lot of things she misses out on that all her friends can do, which does upset me.

'Isla can’t go to parties, or round to her friend’s houses to play, because it’s too dangerous for her. If one of the other children touched her after eating something, it could kill her.

'She can’t take part in sports day, 
or even sit on the carpet with the other children at school, because if 
there’s any trace of dust in it, Isla’s allergies will flare up.

'The one blessing is that she’s been the same her whole life, so she doesn’t really know any different.

'She does sometimes get upset when she sees other children doing things she can’t do.

'The other day, she saw some children eating ice cream, and asked ‘what does that taste like, Mummy?’, which was really upsetting.

'But she’s a brave girl, and doesn’t let her allergies get in the way of running around and being a normal little girl.

'It sounds like a cliche to say you can’t wrap your kids up in cotton wool - but I literally have to.'
