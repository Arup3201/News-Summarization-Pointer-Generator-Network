Frank Lampard finally got the chance to meet his New York City team-mates on Tuesday as they prepared to take on St Mirren in a friendly at Manchester City's academy stadium.

After agreeing a contract with the MLS side in July, Lampard joined Manchester City on loan in August, on a deal initially reported to be until January, where he would then join up with his New York team-mates to prepare for the American season, beginning in March. 

Lampard's City deal now runs until the end of the Premier League season, therefore meaning that the former Chelsea midfielder had not met his New York team-mates due to his Premier League commitments in Manchester.

Lampard agreed a deal to join New York City in July, but later joined Manchester City on a short-term deal - now running until May

In preparation for their first competitive match, against Orlando on March 8, coach Jason Kreis and his New York City players have travelled to London to play two friendlies, giving Lampard a chance to meet his new colleagues.

Alongside a picture on his Facebook page, the 36-year-old former England man said: 'Great to finally meet all my NYCFC teammates! Good luck to the lads for the game against St Mirren today and we all look forward to giving New York a team to be proud of!'

Included in the line-up for the photo is former Barcelona and Spain forward David Villa, the most high-profile of Lampard's new team-mates stateside. The majority of the squad wore blue hooded tops for the snap, with Lampard posing in a black New York-branded jacket.

After leaving Chelsea and agreeing a deal with New York City, Lampard joined Manuel Pellegrini's Manchester City on a short-term deal

The friendly against Scottish outfit St Mirren, followed by another against Danish side Brondby on February 15, will take place in the brand new Manchester City Football Academy Stadium, a 7,000-seat £200million venue. 

Speaking ahead of the friendlies at the beginning of January, New York City coach Kreis told the club's official website: ‘St Mirren and Brondby will provide top-class opposition for us ahead of our first competitive MLS game against Orlando on March 8.

‘We’re delighted to be taking on such strong opposition at a very important stage of our pre-season.’
