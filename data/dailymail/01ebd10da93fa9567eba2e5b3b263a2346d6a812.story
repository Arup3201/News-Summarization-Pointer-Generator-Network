England coach Steve McNamara was left ‘very disappointed’ after winger Ryan Hall was denied a potentially match-winning last-minute try against Australia in the Four Nations.

The Kangaroos were clinging to a 16-12 lead when Hall attempted to touch down ahead of full-back Greg Inglis with 46 seconds left.

Neither Hall nor his team-mates initially celebrated and with referee Gerard Sutton not giving a try, his brother Bernard, the video official, needed ‘sufficient evidence’ — according to Australian NRL rules — to overturn the decision. 

Ryan Hall had a last-minute try disallowed as Australia beat England 16-12 in the Four Nations on Sunday

But the referee consulted his video assistant to rule out the try, denying the visitors a famous win

 

He ruled that Hall had failed to find downward pressure, which left Australia celebrating a face-saving victory at Melbourne’s AAMI Park.

Tries: Jennings, Hunt, Inglis,

Goals: Smith (2)

England (12) 12

Tries: Watkins, Hall

Goals: Widdop (2)

McNamara believes the try should have been awarded and told the BBC: ‘I thought it was a try but we probably need to have a lot closer look at that. It looks like his fingers are on the ball when the ball hit the ground so we are very disappointed.’

Hall admitted he was unsure whether he had scored, adding: ‘I knew I’d got something on it but I wasn’t sure whether I grounded it or not, so I didn’t want to make a big fuss about it because we wanted the ball back at least.

‘Someone said that if it was Super League rules, that would have been a try, but we’re not in Super League are we?’

Australia coach Tim Sheens felt the right decision was made. ‘Had it been a try I think Ryan Hall would have been celebrating, but he wasn’t,’ he said. ‘They all went back for a line drop-out so I think we got the right decision.’ 

England must now beat New Zealand in their next game to have any chance of winning the Four Nations

Hall was in sublime form for England and scored a try of his own earlier on but it was not enough

The defeat leaves England two points behind New Zealand and level with Australia, but they will secure a place in the Wellington final on November 15 — and a potential rematch with the Kangaroos — if they win by more than 10 points in Dunedin on Saturday.

It will be the first meeting between the sides since Shaun Johnson broke England hearts with a try 20 seconds from time in last year’s World Cup semi-final at Wembley.

Sunday's game turned on the second-half introduction of half-back Ben Hunt as Australia, who opened the scoring with Michael Jennings’ 17th-minute try, hit back with two tries in seven minutes.

Hunt touched down captain Cameron Smith’s grubber kick within two minutes of coming on for his debut and Inglis went over to restore his side’s lead.

England face an anxious wait to hear if two key forwards will be available after being placed on report. A match review panel will today examine an alleged trip by Sean O’Loughlin and a potential ‘chicken wing’ tackle by Liam Farrell.

Australia also missed a glorious opportunity late in the first half when Jennings got past Watkins but failed to find his winger with the final pass and England enjoyed another slice of fortune when Inglis was denied a try on 46 minutes for an obstruction.

Widdop and Sarginson then combined to bring down Inglis just short of the line but the game was blown wide open in the next play when debutant Ben Hunt grabbed a try two minutes after entering the action, touching down Smith's grubber kick on the last tackle.

This time Smith added the goal to cut the deficit to just two points and the Kangaroos were back in front six minutes later when Hunt and Smith combined to get Cherry-Evans into a hole and Inglis was on his inside to touch down for his 25th try for his country.

Smith's second goal made it 16-12 and that's the way it stayed despite Hall's last-minute heroics.
