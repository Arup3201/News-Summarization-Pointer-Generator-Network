Jailed: Thief Adrian Robertson, 40, had previously robbed a partially-sighted musician

An 81-year-old woman had her handbag stolen after she stood up from her church pew to take communion.

Silvia Federicei-Palmieri, a Brazilian believed to be on a long holiday in the UK, was at a morning church service on her birthday when a couple snatched her bag.

Adrian Robertson, 40, was sentenced to five months in jail on Tuesday for the theft. Rebecca Mills, 32, pleaded guilty last month and was handed an eight-week sentence.

The couple walked into a Sunday service at Our Lady Immaculate RC Church in Surbiton, Surrey, on January 19, the court heard.

Congregation member Deborah Roberts said she saw Mills take the bag from the pew.

She told Wimbledon Magistrates’ Court: ‘As they were about to go to sit down, she seemed to bend down and grab something.

'They walked back out of the pews together while he was looking over his shoulder.’

Churchgoers including Sunday school pupils chased the pair down the road but did not catch them. They were later arrested by police.

Sunday school teacher Rachel Street told the court: ‘They were getting away. I was shouting at them, “I’m from the church, you have taken the bag”.’

Robertson, of West Ewell, Surrey, claimed he did not know Mills had taken the bag until after they left.

Mills, of Epsom, Surrey, said she had not planned to steal it, but was drunk and ‘saw the opportunity’.

Sentencing Robertson, District Judge Ken Grant described the theft as a ‘joint enterprise’, adding that stealing from an 81-year-old woman in church made the crime ‘particularly unpleasant’.

Robertson, who stood trial at Wimbledon Magistrates’ Court, is already serving a 13-week sentence for an earlier theft, and in 2009 was jailed for two and a half years for robbing a partially-sighted musician in Epsom.

Communion: The theft took place during a morning service at Our Lady Immaculate Church in Surbiton

Congregation member Deborah Roberts, who gave evidence behind a screen, said she saw the pair enter the pews and thought they were going to sit down as people went up for communion.

She said: 'As they were about to go to sit down, she seemed to bend down and grab something then they walked back out of the pews together while he was looking over his shoulder.'

Ms Roberts said she pursued the pair out of the church and called after them but they walked away quickly and broke into a run.

She said: 'She had gone to take communion, she had left her handbag in the pew to walk down the central aisle.'

In the dock, Robertson claimed they only went into the church in order to use the toilet after sleeping rough under a flight of stairs the previous night.

He claimed he did not know Mills had taken the bag until they had left the church.

He said: 'I think she picked the bag up, it was by mistake. Nothing was taken from the bag. It was a drunken mistake.'

Robertson denied being on the look-out or playing any part in the theft. He said: 'Why would I want to take a bag when I was on the way to my Mum’s for Sunday dinner?

'That’s totally wrong. I’m Catholic myself. I did not see no bag or anything when I was in the church.'

He said they walked out of the church, adding: 'The only time I ran is when I ran across the road and I stopped after that. I had no need to run.'

While giving evidence Mills, who had a ponytail and navy top, said she did not plan to take the bag but just 'saw the opportunity' while under the influence of drink.

She said: 'It was on the floor. I just picked it up. I went round the back towards M&S and threw it down because I thought it was wrong. I didn’t even open it.'

She added: 'I threw the bag because I felt guilty. I took the blame and said I’m really sorry. You can’t blame someone else for what I have done.'

After giving evidence she whispered to Robertson: 'I love you.'
