Back in the Seventies, he had one of the most recognisable faces on the planet.

Nowadays few would give this bearded man a second glance.

Paul Michael Glaser – who was one half of detective duo Starsky and Hutch – strolled into rehearsals in Southampton this week virtually unnoticed.

Now 70, he is in Britain preparing for his latest role in a touring production of the musical Fiddler on the Roof.

Forty years ago the American was a global sex symbol playing Starsky opposite David Soul as Hutch.

These days his once curly black hair is grey, he has grown a beard and he is somewhat stockier. When pictured he was wearing a poor-fitting blue T-shirt, cargo shorts and ankle-high socks with trainers.

In Fiddler on the Roof, he plays the role of Tevye. The production, directed by Strictly Come Dancing judge Craig Revel Horwood, is touring 21 regional venues.

However despite ‘enjoying’ working with Strictly’s Mr Nasty, the actor said he had no desire to take part in the come dancing competition.

In a recent interview he said: ‘I love any challenge, but I’ve never been a fan of reality shows. I don’t think it’s something I’d enjoy.

‘In the beginning, I found celebrity to be fascinating.

‘I suppose some of me was frightened by it, but the larger part of me really wanted to be a celebrity.

‘When I got there, I couldn’t believe that had been something I’d wanted.'

Speaking about his Starsky and Hutch days Mr Glaser described how women threw themselves at him when he played the detective heart throb.

He said: ‘I guess they did, but you know what that’s all about — fame.

‘We all crave a real, intimate relationship and then there’s the candy and that was all candy.

‘Me, I prefer fruit — it’s better for you, although candy can occasionally be quite good.

‘But I don’t think I was prepared for that level of fame, and when I got it, I didn’t like it at all. But that’s part of the package and now I’m OK with it.’

The sitcom veteran returned to the big screen in 2003 in romantic comedy Something’s Gotta Give. He also had a brief cameo in the 2004 spoof film version of Starsky & Hutch, starring Ben Stiller.

Fiddler on the Roof is a musical with music by Jerry Bock and book by Joseph Stein, set in Tsarist Russia in 1905.

It is based on Tevye, the village milkman, who has always stuck by his traditions when suddenly his headstrong daughters decide they don’t want to have arranged marriages.
