The distraught aunt of Boston bomb suspects Dzhokhar and Tamerlin Tsarnaev believes the men have been framed - so is flying to Massachusetts to protest their innocence.

Sobbing uncontrollably, trainee lawyer Maret Tsarnaeva, who lives in Toronto, told MailOnline that she feared for 19-year-old Dzhokhar's safety.

The younger Tsarnaev is in hospital recovering from wounds sustained in a gun battle with authorities on Friday, while his brother was killed.

'One has been killed and it would be convenient if the other was not able to speak out to declare his innocence,' she said. 'I have to go to Dzhokhar. To be with him at his bedside – to protect him – if they will let me.'

Protests: Maret Tsarnaev, the aunt of Boston bombing suspects, said she believes they have been framed

Maret, a single mother with a four-year-old son, believes her nephews have been 'conveniently framed' for the marathon attacks.

'I feel I have to be there in Boston for Dzhokhar – otherwise people will think the family do not care.

'I spoke to my brother Anzor – the boys' father – and I promised him I would be there for Dzhokhar until the end of this ugly journey.

'The phone call tore me up. Anzor was distraught and today so am I. When the manhunt was on I was strong. But now I am so lost.

'I feel so helpless because I don’t know who to call for help. No one wants to know, everyone is saying they are guilty.

'As soon as their names came out I called the FBI. I told the woman on the tip line that they had never been in trouble, that they could not have done this.

Accused: Tamerlan Tsarnaev, left, and his younger brother Dzhokhar allegedly planted the marathon bombs

'She didn’t even take down my contact information and no one for the FBI has been in touch since.

'Then I called the police and all they could do was try to prohibit me from speaking to the media.

'I have to speak out. These boys could not have done this – they have never been around guns or explosives.

'Listen to what their friends, their teachers and their sports coaches are saying. They were good boys.

'After the marathon bombs Dzhokhar was going about his normal daily life. He wasn’t on the run or in hiding. It was only after the FBI put their photographs out that all the trouble happened.

'Then these photographs come out – 
showing them at the marathon, moving about. I do wonder what really 
happened. Maybe they were photo shopped on.

Scene: Dzhokhar was found in a boat in Watertown, Massachusetts on Friday following a massive manhunt

Caught: He was found in the boat after a massive manhunt and is now recovering in hospital

'They have been framed. I don’t know why but someone has done this and these boys have been smeared by cheap lies.

'Now one has been killed and the 
other is badly injured. He has been shot in the neck, so he cannot speak
and it would be convenient if he did not survive.

Fears: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's aunt said she now fears for his safety after he was 'framed'

'I have to speak out for them. I am going to go to Boston in the next few days. I promised their father that.'

Maret moved to Toronto in 1996, then filled out much of the paperwork to bring the rest of the family over.

Dzhokhar was eight when he arrived with his mother Zubeida and father in 2002. Tamerlan arrived the following year with his uncle Ruslan.

Maret, 45, said the boys’ father returned to Russia last year after being beaten up on the street in Boston.

'It was an unexplained attack. It is unimportant,' she said. 'He was frustrated in America. His sons were growing, they didn’t need him anymore.

'He said to me, "I’m losing my family. They all seem to know everything, how to run a family, how to raise a family."

'But he knew at heart they were good boys. And we know they not involved in the marathon bombs, they have been cruelly framed.

'People want to start something - they say lets involve the Russians or the Chechnyans, whatever sounds convincing.

'My nephews have been framed. Now the authorities don’t want Dzhokhar to stand up and declare his innocence.

'I have never felt so helpless. But I will not keep silent. I do not want people to think the relatives don’t care, that we aren’t concerned.'

Distraught: Parents Anzor and Zubeidat Tsarnaev are hoping to visit their son in the U.S.

Maret said she had been monitoring Facebook and other internet sites to see if there was any 'chatter' about her nephews being framed.

When asked who she thought had framed her nephews, she became hysterical and started wailing loudly.

'You tell me. Who do you think did this?' she said. 'They were good boys, dragged from their beds by unidentified people and framed. They shot one, then the other.

'I have had threats, people phoning my home to tell me to be careful. I don’t answer them back, I just put the phone down. I am very scared.'

Maret said she had last seen her nephews five years ago. But she spoke to Tamerlan on the phone a year ago and was excited to hear news of his wife and toddler daughter.

'He was not good at staying in touch, that’s why when he phoned another of my brothers this week and asked for forgiveness he was saying sorry for not being in touch enough.

'People have read too much into that. There are other things people should be concentrating on.

'People keep asking about my family background. What is the point of that? There is nothing in our background except that we worked hard.

'My family has known tragedy, terrible tragedy. Now my nephews have been framed for a crime I know they could not have committed.

'In my heart I know they did not do this.'
