An eight-year-old boy has died in a tragic farming accident on a rural property in the Port Stephens area on the NSW mid-north coast.

Just after midday on Sunday police were called to a property in Swan Bay where they were directed to an injured boy.

It is believed that the eight-year-old became trapped under a tractor while his grandfather was driving it.

Ambulance paramedics were called; however, the boy died at the scene. 

Police from Port Stephens Local Area Command will now prepare a report for the Coroner, outlining the full circumstances surrounding the child’s death. 

More to come.
