Kim, Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian know fashion.

This month they launch their first British clothing line for high-street stalwart Dorothy Perkins and to celebrate the sisters have been sharing their style secrets.

Speaking exclusively to FEMAIL Kim, Kourtney and Khloe explain how they would style their favourite pieces from their eponymous line, the Kardashian Kollection, as well as share the style rules they live by and tell us what they love about each others' looks.

Sister act: Kourtney, Kim and Khloe Kardashian model clothes from their Dorothy Perkins line

The siblings have created over 100 larger-than-life pieces for the brand, with a heavy emphasis on the party season, including sequined clutch bags, sparkling tops and, naturally, swathes of dance floor ready dresses.

The collection is available from Dorothy Perkins from tomorrow, making it easy to emulate your favourite sister.

Kim: 'With my figure, I might belt a looser dress in to create focus on my waist line'

What is your favourite piece from the collection? How would you style it three different ways?

I absolutely love our sheer spot blouse, which comes in both ivory and black. This blouse is so chic and versatile for any occasion. The polka dot details are divine. and the feminine tailoring is so on trend at the moment. As soon as we could get our hands on the first samples we have been wearing this blouse everywhere! 

It is perfect for a business meeting with a tight black pencil skirt and simple black pump heels. I would pull my hair into a sleek ponytail or top knot bun and pair with our gold hoops, which I love! It's a great go-to outfit if you need to dress to impress for work.

If I was heading to dinner with friends, I could pair the blouse with our cute black shorts, sexy heels or ankle boots and a fabulous little clutch. A statement ring and earrings would definitely complete the look. If it was a little colder, a black blazer is the perfect solution. 

For more relaxed weekend style, you can pair with leather pants, simple black heels and an oversized statement tote with hair down. 

What is the one style rule you live by? 

I always try and buy timeless pieces. I avoid fashion fads that are totally out by the next season. My sisters and I - with our Kardashian Kollection design partner Bruno Schiavi - always look to include timeless trends like lace and leopard print.

Are your looks very different? What do you like about each others style? 

I think we all have a similar appreciation of style. Sometimes we do wear the same things and I love how my sisters can make something look so different. With my figure, I might belt a looser dress in to create focus on my waist line whilst Kourt looks fabulous in it worn loose. 

Who is the Kardashian/Dorothy Perkins girl? 

The girls and women that love fashion and style and are looking for affordable prices to look on trend.

Short and sassy: Kim's favourite pieces from the Kardashian Kollection are the sheer spot blouse (£35) and the black shorts with satin trim (£30)

Kourtney: 'Have fun with fashion! Life is too short to take it seriously'

What is your favourite piece from the collection? How would you style it THREE different ways?

I
 love our gold sequin jacket - I think it's so stunning 
and workable for so many occasions. This is definitely one of my 
favourite pieces. I think sequins are fun and add a little boho flair.

My
 favourite way to wear this jacket is over a simple black top with faux 
leather tights. I would definitely wear this to a family dinner with 
black ballet flats or out with some suede black thigh high boots. A long
 gold necklace would work really well with a fun ring. I think a big 
black oversized bag would work best with this outfit. 

If
 you want a way to really make a little black dress stand out then this 
jacket is perfect. Add chic black heels and a cool clutch. 

If
 you're looking to add a touch of glam to the perfect daytime lunch 
outfit then this sequin blazer looks great with the sleeves rolled up 
over a white t shirt and jeans. You can roll up the bottoms of the jeans
 or leave them down depending on what works best for your body shape and
 pair with great sandals. 

What is the one style rule you live by? 

Have
 fun with fashion! Life is too short to take it seriously. I am a very 
moody dresser...I dress for my moods, so if I'm feeling a like having 
some fun, I will throw on a turban to spice things up a little bit. It's
 all about how clothes make you feel. 

Are your looks very different? What do you like about each others style? 

I'm
 definitely more adventurous with my style and am not afraid to go for 
bolder colours and prints. I think my sisters are so fashionable in 
general and really know how to rock their curvy figures. Kim always 
looks stunning in a bodycon dress whilst I love love love a leather look
 on Khloe. She can seriously pull off anything, especially with the amazing shoes she always has on. When packing for Miami, I told Kim that
 I would most definitely be offending her with my bright colors and 
prints, since she is an all black or an all white phase when it comes to
 her fashion. 

Who is the Kardashian/Dorothy Perkins girl? 

We
 really take inspiration from our fans - what they want, what they like 
and what they are looking to spend. They are our Kardashian/Dorothy 
Perkins girls because they look to us for style inspiration and we're 
excited to finally be able to offer the UK our line.

Gold sequin jacket: £50

Azure top with lace detail: £32

Blue leopard-print top: £30

Khloe: 'Always dress for your body! Not every trend works for every body type'

What is your favourite piece from the collection? How would you style it three different ways?

One
 of my favourite pieces of the UK line would be our Gold Bar Bodycon 
dress. The dress comes in different colours and prints like leopard 
print, green and red, but I can't go past classic black. The dress is 
tight fitting with long sleeves and a cut out below the neck highlighted
 by a gold bar. It's a super sexy dress, yet also conservative for a 
work to dinner look. I am a big fan of long sleeve classy dresses. This 
is a huge favourite of mine.

The
 dress is an ideal purchase in the lead up to holiday season and can be 
paired with rocking black heels and classic gold jewelry with a black 
clutch for the ultimate night out. This dress is perfect for an event 
where you want to look your best and make an impression.

For date night or dinner with someone special, throw a chic trench coat 
over the dress to keep warm. Our Kardashian Kollection line has a 
gorgeous lace trench coat that would go perfectly. Pair with heeled 
black ankle boots and wear your hair in a sleek ponytail. I think you 
should keep accessories to a minimum with this look. I am an earring 
girl so I would personally go towards a basic but fab gold hoop. If 
earrings aren't your thing, then keep it simple and wear a statement 
ring.

For a day time 
event where you still need to dress up a little, pair the dress with a 
great fitting denim jacket and gorgeous black flat sandals. A black tote
 would match the outfit perfectly and help keep all your daytime 
essentials with you.

What is the one style rule you live by?

Always
 dress for your body! Not every trend works for every body type. But I 
am a strong believer that every woman, no matter her size or age 
can incorporate the current trends of the season in to her look. Just 
remember to not lose yourself in finding the right way to wear a trend your way. Trendy doesn't mean you can't put your own personal signature 
on it.Know the ones that work for you and always accentuate your 
assets.

Are your looks very different? What do you like about each others style?

I
 think Kim and I have a similar style whilst Kourt definitely rocks 
brighter colours and prints more often. I take a leap out of her book 
sometimes and try to work in something really bright like coloured 
jeans. We notice our differences in our styles more when we are 
designing our collection with Bruno. There are things we all 
agree on like leopard print whilst there may be a top that one of us 
really likes more than others but we'll keep it in the line because it 
suits her style really well.

We have learned so much from in our design process. We have learned over the 
years that we cannot just design for ourselves. Our consumer is our 
voice and that's who we have to focus on. We love constructive criticism
 and we love fan feedback. We have always considered ourselves a social 
media brand. A brand for our fans and we wholeheartedly respect their 
wishes and we fight to give our consumers everything they wish for such 
as Kardashian Kurves which is our plus size line in America.

Who is the Kardashian/Dorothy Perkins girl? The Kardashian/Dorothy Perkins girl loves timeless fashion and has a focus on the latest trends. It's
 a dream come true to be bringing our Kardashian Kollection line to the 
UK because we get to make it accessible to so many more of our fans 
through Dorothy Perkins. Our line includes all the things we love about 
fashion - the trends we love, the details we are crazy for and pieces 
that suit our body types - all designed for our fans and those who love 
fashion as much as we do.
