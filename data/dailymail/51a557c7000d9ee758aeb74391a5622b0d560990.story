Three weeks ago Romanian migrant Victor Spirescu arrived in the UK with the promise that he wanted to work and then go home.

But after just one day washing cars with a friend in Biggleswade, he suddenly quit and disappeared.

Now it seems he has landed a new job earning £60-a-day working on a building site somewhere in east London, and is planning on moving his 19-year-old fiancee Catalina Curcean to the UK as well.

Victor Spirescu, the first Romanian to arrive in the UK on New Years Day, has got a new job on a building site in east London

He quit his firs job washing cars after just two days but blames media attention following claims he assaulted his ex-girlfriend and tried to drown her in a lake

Spirescu says Catalina is hoping to move from their pig and sheep farm in Transylvania and get a job as a cleaner.

He says her money will be spent paying for all their bills and food, while his money will be saved to buy a Mercedes when they move back to Romania in a year's time.

Spirescu has refused to talk about the crime, though insists he is now a changed man

For the time being Catalina is fending for herself by chopping enough wood to burn so she can stay warm in temperatures as low as minus 25c.

She then has to clean out a sty where a pig is being reared. It will be killed to eat next Christmas.

There is no running water in the crumbling one-bedroom house she bought with Mr Spirescu for £2,000 two years ago in the  village of Pelisor, which is 200 miles north of the capital Bucharest.

Miss Curcean has to repeatedly lower a bucket on a winch down a well on the mud lane outside her home for cooking, cleaning and drinking. There is an outside toilet which consists of a hole in the ground covered by a wooden hut.

After quitting his first job Spirescu says he has just £5 left until payday, and is on the lookout for a better paying job such as working in the North Sea crab fishing, or on an oil platform.

Speaking to the Guardian, the 30-year-old says he quit his first job after media pressure surrounding his private life forced him out.

It was revealed shortly after he arrived in the UK that Siprescu had a past conviction for assault against his ex-girlfriend, which he has refused to talk about in detail, insisting that he is a changed man.

It was claimed last week the Spirescu beat ex-girlfriend Ana, 26, to the ground in a park before threatening to drown her in a lake.

After that Spirescu says he received more than 50 calls a day from journalists and had photographers pretending to need a car wash in order to take pictures of him.

People even stopped him in the street to ask for an autograph.

Little more is known about Spirescu's past, except that he was born in Bucharest before moving to the small village of Pelisor. He says he left school at 18, learned English from the television, and then got on a plane to London.

Victor is now planning to move his girlfriend Catalina over to London so she can get a job as a cleaner and the couple can save money for a Mercedes

Speaking about his time in England he says he expected the capital to be cleaner, and criticised British food for being 'tasteless' compared to the chicken which he kills and eats himself at home.

Speaking about his welcome party waiting at the airport for his arrival, he said: 'There were television cameras, journalists and this guy Keith Vas - what was that about? I had no idea.'
