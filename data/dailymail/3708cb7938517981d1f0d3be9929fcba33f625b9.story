Was your team on the wrong end of a harsh refereeing decision this weekend? Then spare a thought for a Honduras keeper who was sent off recently.

Junior Morales was having a good 50 minutes in the Marathon goal as his side were leading 1-0 at Real Sociedad in a Honduras top flight match on October 12.

The keeper then picked up a loose ball untroubled before slapping a striker, who had closed in for a challenge, sportingly on the backside as he prepared to kick the ball up field. 

Nothing you haven't seen done many times before on a football field, really. Except the 36-year-old was sent off for the gesture!

After a tip off from the referee's assistant, Morales was given a second yellow card and dismissed from the field. To make matters worse Sociedad were given a penalty for the 'offence'.

Henry Martinez would dispatch the spot-kick to equalise in the 1-1 draw, ensuring the match would end on a bum note.
