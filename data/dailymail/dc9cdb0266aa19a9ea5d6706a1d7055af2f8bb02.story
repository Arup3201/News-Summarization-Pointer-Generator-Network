The mother of a pregnant teenager murdered by her abusive boyfriend has shared her harrowing story in the hope it will prevent future tragedies.

Samantha Shrewsbury, mother of the late Jayden Parkinson, opened up on today's This Morning.

The distraught mother, 47, told how she tried to protect Jayden from her abusive boyfriend, Ben Blakely, who killed the teenager in December last year.

The bereaved mother described how Blakely isolated her daughter from her family.

She said: 'He took her away from everyone in the family – her sisters, brother, me, her dad. He used to cut up her SIM card and smash up her phone.'

Blakely was abusive towards his girlfriend throughout their relationship. He would burn her with cigarettes, punch her and starve her.

'He was physically abusive from day one,' said Samantha. 'But
 when she was living in the flat with him and his cousins he'd go 
away for a couple of days to another girlfriend, have a roast dinner 
there and come back and tell Jayden all about it.'

'At one point she hadn't eaten for four days. She rang Childline, they called the police and social services took her some food round because she hadn't eaten for that long,' she said.

Trying to explain why her daughter stayed in the relationship, Samantha from Didcot, Oxfordshire, said: 'She was 17 and totally in love with him. I think she thought, "I can change him".

'I think also because of the threats towards towards our family – her nieces and nephews and me. She probably thought, "If I stay away from the 
family they'll be safe".'

The mother told of the great lengths she went to in an attempt to keep Jayden from her destructive  relationship, even locking her in the house.

‘She’d get out through windows,' she said. 'I sent her to her sister's for six weeks, but he would always find a way of getting to her - either by phone or he’d get a little note to her.'

Eventually the distraught mum tried tough love, telling her daughter: 'It's either him or me'. But Jayden, who was living back at home at the time, still refused to finish the relationship and ended up moving to a hostel.

‘For two days she slept outside my front door. One of the hardest things I've ever had to do is to step over my daughter in the morning and carry on with what I wanted to do to prove a point.'

But the ultimatum didn't work and Jayden refused to leave her violent lover.

Remembering her beloved daughter, Samantha said: ‘She was quirky, funny, spontaneous - could be like any ordinary teenager, a pain in the backside. She hated me sometimes, loved me sometimes - but she was a good kid all in all.'

Describing the first moment she laid eyes on Blakely, Shrewsbury recalls how he whistled at her daughter across the road and she immediately had a bad feeling about him. 'I said to Jayden, "Urgh, who's he?" and Jayden said, "He's my friends brother – he's a rat anyway".'

When they first started dating Samantha thought the relationship wouldn't go anywhere, but when Jayden turned 16 things progressed.

'In the beginning I tried to let them both get on with it to see. But I warned him, "You harm a hair on my daughter’s head you’ll rue the day you ever met my family." And he said, "I promise Mrs Shewsbury, I won't". He came round and had a bacon sandwich with us and he seemed pretty genuine.'

The concerned mother had heard Blakely had a bad reputation but wasn't sure what to believe.

'The stories I heard beforehand about him decapitating a cat all seemed pretty farcical – although it came out in court that they were true,' she said.

Jayden finally plucked up the courage to 
end the relationship in November last year, with Blakeley threatening to
 pose intimate photographs online to "humiliate" her.

But shortly afterwards she found out she was pregnant. On 3 December 2013, a few days after telling Blakely she was carrying his baby, the teenager was murdered. Her body was later found on 18 
December, buried in Ben's uncle's grave.

Fighting back the tears, the heartbroken mother described the days leading up to her daughter's brutal murder.

'She was scared,' she said of her daughter discovering she was pregnant. 'She was crying 
on the phone and didn’t know what to do. I arranged to meat on the 
Tuesday – that fateful day – to discuss her options.

'I gave her the three 
options - adoption, abortion or keeping it. I explained through each option 
and there was no other choice for her but to keep the baby.

'She would have been a brilliant mum - she loved kids, she loved her nieces and nephews dearly.

'I said my goodbyes to her and arranged to met her that Friday to go Christmas shopping and to get maternity clothes.

'She was still living in a hostel and didn't want to come back – she didn't want to bring any more drama to anybody's home. That was the last time I saw my daughter.'

In June this year, Blakely was 
sentenced to life with a minimum term of 20 years and Samantha attended everyday of the trial and witnessed every traumatic testimony.

'I did it for my daughter. No matter how harrowing, I needed to know all that – I didn't want my mind to make it up. At some point I'm going to do the walk to where they murdered her – but not just yet. I'm not ready.'

She added how disappointed she was with the sentence. 'I was wanting 30 years but he got a minimum of 15, then eight for perverting the course of justice. Then he had three years knocked off for being "nice",' she said ironically.

'He's got a life now – he has three meals a day. I've lost my daughter, I've lost my grandchild, I've lost a big part of my future and our families future.

'It does make me angry that when he's 42 he could be free. Although it doesn’t mean that when he goes for parole he’s going to get it. I will fight my damnedest for him not to to.'

The brave mother has now launched charity Jayden's Gift, to help 16-18 year-old's who might find themselves in trouble, but not have access to social services.

She hopes to sponsor houses for teenagers in need to help them through college and to set up mentoring programmes. 

'Rest in peace Jayden, but I will never forgive,' said the heartbroken mother. 'There will never be any forgiveness from my family - ever.'
