The NHS is on a ‘knife edge’ and there may be ‘unexpected disasters', a senior boss has said. 

Paul Baumann, the health service’s finance chief, gave a stark warning after it emerged hospital waiting times are at their worst for six-and-a-half years.

It came as a report revealed the number of hospitals needing emergency government bailouts has doubled in 12 months.

The National Audit Office said 31 trusts had handouts last year, costing more than half a billion pounds.

MPs and health experts said the situation was ‘deeply alarming’.

Figures released yesterday show 3.2million patients are waiting for operations, scans and treatment – the most since April 2008.

This includes 37,712 waiting for surgery longer than the Government target of 18 weeks – nearly double the number in May 2010.

Mr Baumann told an NHS England meeting yesterday: ‘This feels as if it is the year we are on the knife edge.’ He said the health service ‘can’t guarantee against any unexpected disasters’. 

Officials would not say what these might be but they could include patients having to wait for hours on trolleys in A&E units this winter.

Mr Baumann’s ‘knife edge’ comment is understood to refer to whether NHS England would meet financial targets. 

He is understood to have been explaining that meeting the financial targets are on a ‘knife edge’ and will depended on whether there are unexpected disasters such as a flu epidemic. 

Today’s report by the National Audit Office shows the number of hospitals needing Government bailouts rose from 17 in 2012/13 to 31 in 2013/14.

Margaret Hodge MP, chairman of the influential Public Accounts Committee, said the report was ‘deeply alarming’, adding: ‘I do not believe it is any exaggeration to say that the future sustainability of our National Health Service is at risk.

‘Some trusts are only getting by on handouts. Things are getting worse … and we all know that when trusts are under this kind of financial stress it is the quality and safety of patient care that can suffer.’

Last month health bosses warned the NHS would need an extra £8billion by 2020 to meet the demands of the aging population.

NHS chief Simon Stevens said that without the money consequences for patients would be ‘severe’. 

The Patients’ Association’s Katherine Murphy said: ‘We receive many calls … about delays in treatment, incorrect diagnosis and undignified care.

‘We have known for many years that underfunding … has a direct impact on the quality of care … [and] on patient safety.’

North Cumbria University Hospitals received a £42million bailout, and Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals, Cambridgeshire, £41million. 

A Welsh cancer patient faces having to move to a caravan in England to get a drug that could prolong his life.

Kidney cancer sufferer David Southwood, 53, of Newport, Gwent, used savings to buy Axitinib as the NHS in Wales will not pay for it.

But he cannot afford to keep funding the treatment, and may have to live 50 miles away in a Somerset caravan, owned by his mother, to continue receiving it.

He said: ‘If I wait until December or January I probably won’t be here. It’s quite disturbing … I may lose the consultant I’ve had for the last two years. I have … no family at all in England so it would be isolating.’

Axitinib is free on the NHS in England via the Cancer Drugs Fund. But the Labour-run Welsh government has rejected calls to set up a similar fund. 

A spokesman said: ‘We are unable to comment on individual cases.’

Labour’s health spokesman Jamie Reed said: ‘NHS waiting lists are still heading in the wrong direction. People will be alarmed to hear NHS bosses talking about possible imminent disasters.’

- Meanwhile, the NHS could save £2billion a year by introducing appointments via video link, prescribing cheaper drugs and cutting needless X-rays, senior doctors said.

The Academy of Royal Medical Colleges highlighted 16 areas where spending could be cut including lower-cost statins, which would save £85million a year.
