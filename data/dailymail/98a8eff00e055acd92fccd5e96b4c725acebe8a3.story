A row has broken out over the £1million will of Labour MP Jimmy Wray, amid claims his disabled youngest son has been left penniless.

The Left-wing politician died in May at the age of 78 – but the extent of his wealth has only now been revealed.

It has emerged that the three-times married former MP had a villa in France as well as properties in Stirlingshire and Glasgow.

Family row: Three-times married Jimmy Wray died in May at the age of 78

But his family are at war amid claims by his widow that their disabled son, Frankie, 15, was written out of the will in favour of his three grown-up children from his first marriage.

Laura Wray, 51, has called in a handwriting expert to challenge the will's authenticity, claiming four signatures on the document may not be her husband's. She also claims that a missing part of the four-page document raises questions about its validity.

The couple separated in 2009 but remained friends until his death from bowel cancer.

Frankie suffers from Angelman syndrome – the same condition as author Ian Rankin's son, Kit – which means he cannot talk, dress or feed himself He also has difficulty walking and needs 24-hour care.

But the will bequeaths Mr Wray's entire estate to his son and daughters from his first  marriage, to Mary Frew:  James, 43, Jacqueline, 49, and  46-year-old Michelle.

Glasgow lawyers, Jeffrey Aitken, who represent the Wray estate, have advertised for anyone with an alternative will to contact them.

Mrs Wray, an advocate who now owns the marital home –worth an estimate £1million – in Port of Menteith, Stirlingshire, said: 'Jimmy told me he was going to leave money in a trust so that Frankie would want for nothing.

'A couple of days after Jimmy's death I discover he  has been disinherited. I was devastated. It seems inexplicable that Jimmy would do something like this. It doesn't sit with his public persona or the sort of man he was.'

She added: 'My concern is for Frankie and not for myself.'

Mr Wray's estate is potentially worth £1million if a villa in Cannes, currently on the market at £700,000, is included. At the time of his death, he also owned two flats and a jeweller's shop in Aberfoyle, Stirlingshire, as well as a flat in Muirend, Glasgow.

Mr Wray married Laura in 1999 after a bitter divorce from his second wife, Cathy.

James Wray jnr said at the weekend that his father's estate was worth closer to £300,00-£400,000.

He claimed Mrs Wray had been left the marital home, a house in France and a £1,200-a-month pension.

He told a Sunday newspaper: 'I think my dad thought these things were more than sufficient for Frankie.'
