Women are now getting plastic surgery  to look like their perfectly angled and flawlessly filtered Instagram selfies - in real life.

While it's not uncommon for those seeking cosmetic procedures to request certain celebrities' features, the latest plastic surgery trend sees women using their own edited snapshots from the social media app as a guideline for the operations they want done.

'This is a huge trend,' New York City-based plastic surgeon Dr Elie Levine told the New York Daily News. 'People are bringing in pictures of themselves taken at a favorite angle or filtered, and saying they want to look like that.'

Geri Hubner, a mom from Central Jersey, started using Instagram filters to disguise her sagging jowl, but realized that she wanted to look like she did in her edited photos all of the time.

After showing New Jersey plastic surgeon Dr Andrew Miller her Instagram pics, she opted to have a neck lift.  

'He’s an artist. I should have done this years ago,' Ms Hubner told the outlet of her surgery. 

But a desire to look like your favorite filtered selfie, doesn't always result in going under the knife.  

Janet Ross, 47, from San Francisco used to rely on the app's Amaro filter to improve her photos before she sought out plastic surgeon Dr Jonathan Kaplan.

Ms Ross's desired look was achieved through strategically placed fillers and Botox injections.  

'I feel way more confident,' she told ABC News. 'I don’t need the filters anymore.'

Dr Kaplan explained: 'The patients coming in with the filters for Instagram are mostly concerned with wrinkles around their mouth, complexion and different blemishes, dark spots or red spots, and that’s great for them because you don’t really need any surgical procedure.'

According to the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, there was an increase in requests for cosmetic procedures in 2013 that were 'sired by seflies' - especially among those under 30.

The AAFPRS also said this trend 'shows no sign of declining', noting that selfie sticks were 'must-have gifts of this past holiday season.' 

While this trend may be here to stay, some medical professionals see a danger in people trying to achieve a warped idea of perfection. 

Stacy Kaiser, a a psychotherapist from Calabasas, California told ABC News: 'Filters are something special that are designed for a camera, not a plastic surgeon’s fingers.'

But this isn't the only bizarre plastic surgery trend fueled by Instagram.

The rise of engagement selfies has prompted women to seek out cosmetic hand-lifts so they can be camera-ready after their proposal. 

Doctor have been reducing the appearance of patients' visible tendons and veins by injecting anti-aging treatment Juvederm into their hands.

The treatment, which costs upwards of $1,200, lasts for nine months - although a diamond lasts forever.
