With the average house price in the UK rocketing to £260,000, getting on the property ladder is out of reach for many.

But those looking to buy a place of their own might want to try what is being called the cheapest street in Britain, where houses have been known to go on the market with a guide price of just £750.

Limetrees Close, in the Port Clarence area on the outskirts of Middlesbrough, is the site of two of the cheapest homes sold in the country last year and now has a two-bedroom semi-detached property up for auction with a guide price of just £5,000.

Since January 2013, eight properties have sold in Limetrees Close, in the Port Clarence area of Teesside which has been dubbed the cheapest street in Britain, fetching from £8,500 to £33,000. Four properties are currently on the market, with one advertising a guide price of just £5,000

Two of the cheapest properties to sell in the street last year fetched £8,500 and £9,000, confirming the road as one of the least expensive in the North East, according to the Land Registry. 

Other properties in the road have sold for £10,500, £14,000 and £23,000 over the last two years. The most expensive to sell in the close since last January fetched just £33,000. 

The three-bedroom property which sold for £14,000 could have been snapped up for as little as 10p, because no reserve was placed on the property. It was auctioned off with a guide price of just £750 but reached its eventual price after a small bidding war.

The average house price in the UK for 2013 was £166,262, but for homes on Limetrees Close that figure was just £16,714.

A Land Registry spokesman said: 'Officially we can't be sure, but the figures speak for themselves. It is an extremely cheap street.'

The latest vacant property to go on the market consists of a ground floor lounge, kitchen, two first-floor bedrooms, a bathroom and outside gardens and has a guide price of a mere £5,000.

The bargain buy is £220,000 less than a similar two-bedroom family home in South East London auctioned by Eddisons, which is due to be offered this week.

The reserve on the London property is £225,000 and although it boasts a garage, all the rooms on display are relatively the same size as the house on Limetrees Close. 

Last year, a number of properties, some of which were three-bedroom,went on the market and sold for prices ranging from £8,500 to £23,000

Limetrees Close is situated in the deprived community of Port Clarence, close to the River Tees and the Tees Transporter Bridge.

The area suffers from a very high crime rate, and high unemployment rate, and has seen its fair share of arson, fly-tipping and anti-social behaviour.

It is also isolated from nearby towns with poor transport links to nearby Middlesbrough and Stockton.

The £750 house, dubbed the UK's cheapest house, was eventually sold last year for £14,00 - less than the price of some new Ford Focus models - through I-Am-Sold property auctions. 

At the same auction, a similar property on the same road sold for just £10,500 meaning two houses were bought on the same day for a combined price of less than £25,000.

Despite being located in Port Clarence, an area notorious for vandalism and crime, the properties were marketed as ‘an ideal investment'.

Kirsty Wallace, auction coordinator for I-Am-Sold, said: 'We have a history of properties in Limetrees Close selling for extraordinary low prices at auction, so you could call it a bargain street.

'It's definitely worth someone investing in because its a relatively new estate and some of the properties are now selling at £30,000 on Right Move.

'One of the properties a year ago had a guide price of £750.

'There were no other properties in the country with lower guide-price than that and it had no reserve, technically the house could have sold for a few pounds.

'It's quite a bad area, the feedback we've had from previous buyers is that its quite run down and there are a lot of bordered up housing but with the right buyer, the properties can make a worthwhile investment.

'Some of the homes may need a bit of work, but the price will reflect that and with such low prices, it would be difficult to resist for some developers.'

Port Clarence suffers from a high crime and unemployment rates, and has suffered high levels of arson, fly-tipping and anti-social behaviour

Limetrees Close is in the deprived Port Clarence area, near Middlesbrough

Limetrees Close is situated in the deprived community of Port Clarence, on the edge of Middlesbrough.

Port Clarence suffers from a very high crime rate, and very high unemployment rate, and has seen its fair share of arson, fly-tipping and anti-social behaviour.

It is also isolated from nearby towns with poor transport links to nearby Middlesbrough and Stockton.

A severe fire at a wood recycling plant in Port Clarence in March 2011 lasted for nine days, with arson suspected as the cause of the blaze. 

Five people were arrested afterwards but all were released without charge.

Government figures, released last year, reveal the life expectancy of men born in Middlesbrough is currently 75.8 years. The average life expectancy for women is 80.1 years. 

Stockton North MP Alex Cunningham has previously said that 'more needs to be done' in the area.

He said: 'I’ve been contacted by people living in Limetrees Close. 

'That particular street has been subject to fly-tipping and arson, but another issue is to do with dilapidated homes.'

Absentee landlords have been blamed for the decline of the area, with some properties being sold on instead of repaired and maintained properly.
