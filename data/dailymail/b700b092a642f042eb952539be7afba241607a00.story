Today we call them 'trolls' but in 1911, ground-breaking physicist Albert Einstein coined a different term for relentless critics: 'reptiles.'

In a newly unearthed letter he wrote to fellow-physicist Marie Curie, Mr Einstein urged his friend to ignore a series of scandalous rumors concerning her heritage and her love life which were circling her at the time.

'If the rabble continues to occupy itself with you, then simply don't read that hogwash, but rather leave it to the reptile for whom it has been fabricated,' Mr Einstein, then 32, wrote on November 23, 1911.

At the time, Mrs Curie, the first women to win a Novel Prize and a then-38-year-old widow, was being hounded by accusations not only that she was Jewish, and thus undeserving of a position at the French Academy of Sciences, but also that she was having an affair with a married man.

The former rumor was false, and the latter turned out to be true. 

In 1911, Mrs Curie, based in Paris with her two daughters, was competing against 66-year-old Edouard Branly for a physicist seat at the esteemed French Academy of Sciences.

Right-wring French newspaper Excelsior was among those who attacked her candidacy, asking incredulously in one headline 'will a woman enter the Institute?' and claiming she was secretly Jewish based on 'scientific' analysis of her facial characteristics and handwriting.

That autumn, amid the media storm, Mrs Curie joined Mr Einstein as the only woman at an international physics conference in the Belgian capital of Brussels.

In Mr Einstien's subsequent November letter to Mrs Curie, he wrote: 'I am impelled to tell you how much I have come to admire your intellect, your drive, and your honesty, and that I consider myself lucky to have made your personal acquaintance in Brussels.'

When Mrs Curie arrived back in Paris, even more accusations had built against her; this time in regards to her relationship with fellow physicist Paul Langevin, who was married but estranged from his wife.

The French press got their hands on intimate letters exchanged between Ms Curie and Mr Langevin, and promptly declared her a home-wrecker, according to the American Institute of Physics.

'On her return to France, Mrs Curie discovered an angry mob congregated in front of her home in Sceaux, terrorizing 14-year-old Irène and seven-year-old Eve. 

'Mrs Curie and her daughters had to take refuge in the home of friends in Paris,' the site states.

Mr Einstein's letter in response to the scandal begins: 'Do not laugh at me for writing you without having anything sensible to say.

'But I am so enraged by the base manner in which the public is presently daring to concern itself with you that I absolutely must give vent to this feeling.'

Mr Einstein goes on to presume that Mrs Curie probably 'despise[s] this rabble' and blasts the rumor-mills and their 'lust for sensationalism.'

He then refers directly to her relationship with Mr Langevin and states he is 'happy' to have Mrs Curie and Mr Langevin as 'personages', describing them as: 'real people with whom one feels privileged to be in contact.'

Although Ms Curie didn't get her seat at the French Academy of Science, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry that very same year. It was her second win, having won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903.

When members of the Swedish Academy of Sciences wrote to Mrs Curie to dissuade her from coming to Sweden to accept her 1911 Nobel Prize based on her bad press, the plucky scientist responded:

'The prize has been awarded for the discovery of radium and polonium... I cannot accept that the appreciation of the value of scientific work should be influenced by libel and slander concerning private life.'

Mrs Curie died in 1934 at the age of 66 from aplastic anemia, which was believed to have been contracted from her long-term exposure to radiation.

In a 2009 poll carried out by New Scientist, she was voted the 'most inspirational woman in science.'

Mr Einstein, who developed the  general theory of relativity in 1916 and won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, was famed for his outspoken manner, and his letter to Mrs Curie was characteristic of this approach.

He died in 1955 at the age of 76 and left a long legacy of wise-cracking wisdom.

'Only two things are infinite,' he once said. 'The universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former.'
