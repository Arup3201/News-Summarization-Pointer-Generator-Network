Cash-strapped motorists were given some pre-Christmas relief  as supermarkets sparked a price war by slashing up to 2p a litre at the pumps.

Asda said it would be reducing petrol and diesel prices by 2p a litre from Thursday as Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Tesco said they would match the cut from the same time.

Motoring groups welcomed the news.

Cutting prices: Asda has slashed the price of petrol and diesel by 2p per litre from Thursday

It comes after new research showed that motorists are paying a record 81p a litre in tax - both duty and VAT – to the Treasury putting pressure on Chancellor George Osborne to freeze a planned 3p per litre tax hike planned for January.

Asda said its reductions would mean motorists paying no more than 131.7p a litre for petrol and 137.7p a litre for diesel.

Asda petrol trading director Andy Peake said: ‘Today's move shows that we are once again leading the way in reducing the price at the pump.

‘Unlike other retailers, our price cuts benefit everyone across the country, meaning that no one filling up at Asda will be forced to play a postcode lottery.’

Relief: Morrisons has said it would match Asda's price cut from Thursday - in addition to its existing offers to higher spending shoppers

Sainsbury's head of fuel, Richard Crampton, said: ‘With Christmas on the horizon we know that this can be an expensive time of year so we're delighted to announce that from tomorrow we will be lowering our petrol and diesel prices by up to 2p per litre.’

Morrisons said its 2p per litre cut would be in addition to existing offers to higher spending shopper.

The reduction  also comes  into force from Thursday morrow morning and will be up to 2p-a-litre off unleaded and 2p-a-litre off diesel at all Morrisons petrol stations giving motorists a potential 17p-per-litre saving at the pumps.

Persuaded?: Pressure is on Chancellor George Osborne to postpone next year's planned duty increase

Mark Todd, Petrol Director for Morrisons, said: ‘We’re always keen to offer motorists the best value we possibly can and it’s great to be offering these savings in the run up to Christmas.’

Morrisons has 305 petrol stations across the UK and  is also running a ‘Fuel Britannia’ offer giving a 15p a litre discount  to customers who spend £60 in store until Sunday 11th November 2012.

A Tesco spokesperson said: ‘Tesco is dropping the price of unleaded and diesel by up to 2 pence per litre from tomorrow morning.  As Britain’s biggest petrol retailer with 490 forecourts, more motorists will make savings at the pumps at Tesco than at any other fuel retailer.’

AA spokesman Paul Watters said: ‘This is excellent news. Yet again the supermarkets are leading the pack in cutting the price at the pumps. Let’s hope others follow their lead.’

Motorists are paying a record amount of tax from petrol to the Government – 81p on every litre,  new figures reveal today.

Campaigners say the strain on the UK’s 33 million drivers add to the pressure on Chancellor George Osborne to postpone next year’s planned duty increase.

For a typical litre of petrol costing 138.3p at the pumps, some  81p goes to the Treasury in the form of  fuel duty and VAT, according to figures obtained from the House of Commons Library.

Fuel duty is paid at a flat rate of 57.95p per litre. But VAT is levied on the base cost of the fuel AND on the duty – making it a ‘tax on a tax.’

Matching the cut: Sainsbury's also reduced petrol and diesel prices to help consumers over the Christmas period

The 81p  tax equals a record set earlier this year which helped persuade the Chancellor to postpone an earlier proposed tax increase.

Ministers will not discuss in advance the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement which takes place on December 5  although sources  point out that ministers had cancelled or postponed several previous duty increases.

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The Government recognises that the rising price of petrol is a significant part of households’ day-to-day spending.

‘Since coming to office the Government has listened to the concerns of motorists about high pump prices and acted. Fuel is now 10p a litre lower than under the previous government’s plans.'
