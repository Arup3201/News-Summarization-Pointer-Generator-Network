Half of British workers say that 40 per cent of their business is now conducted outside traditional office hours – sending and reading emails in the evenings and at weekends.

Being constantly 'connected' means that one in three Brits find working from home more conducive to working from an office and 18 per cent claim to use a hotel, cafe or outside space to work.

The study of 2,000 workers, by hotel chain Premier Inn, suggests the traditional 9-to-5 working environment is well and truly dead.

Business becoming increasingly global also means many find themselves working to different time zones.

The study found that 35 per cent of Brits feel the most important thing when staying in a hotel during a business trip is a reliable wi-fi connection.

The average British worker now spends seven hours and 12 minutes a week working outside of traditional working hours.  

A spokesperson for Premier Inn said: 'With one in five people suggesting that having no Wi-Fi is the most frustrating element of being away from home, we understand it's now more important than ever to be connected.

'Whether it's keeping in touch with friends and family or making sure that 'that' email can go when it needs to, we want all our guests to sleep easy in the knowledge they can get online with a quality connection in any of our 690 hotels free of charge.'
