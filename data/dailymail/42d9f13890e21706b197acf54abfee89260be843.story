AAA Tipsy Tow's Facebook campaign that invites drinkers to call them up for a free tow home

The Santa Cruz Sentinal reports that partygoers should tell the AAA operator, 'I need a Tipsy Tow,' and a truck will be on its way.

Tipsy Tow's Facebook campaign states: 'No excuses, folks.

'Don’t drink and drive-and don’t ride with anybody who does.

'Tipsy Tow offered by AAA: You don’t have to be a AAA member, from 6pm-6am on New Year’s Eve/Day they will take your drunk self and your car home for FREE.

Save this number… 1-800-222-4357. Please re-post this if you don’t mind.”

The service will provide a one-way ride for the driver and vehicle to the driver's home.

If there are additional passengers who need a ride, they will be taken 
to the driver's home as long is there is sufficient room for them to be 
transported safely in the tow truck.

The service is not available in every state and drivers are instructed to check before calling.

To avoid drink driving accidents, AAA is offering free tow homes tonight. File picture.
