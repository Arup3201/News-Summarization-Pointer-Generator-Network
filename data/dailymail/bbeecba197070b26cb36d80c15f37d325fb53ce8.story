A teenage girl who was found unconscious with a scarf tied tightly around her neck last Wednesday has died.

Kayleigh Palmer, 16, was pronounced dead at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital at 11am yesterday. 

The teenager, understood to be a pupil at Cleeve School in Cheltenham, had been in an induced coma after being strangled in the town’s Humber Road.

Her boyfriend, Aston Robinson, 18, appeared at Cheltenham Magistrates’ Court on Friday charged with attempted murder.

Robinson, 18, of Humber Road, did not enter a plea to the charge and was remanded in custody.

It will now be up to detectives and the Crown Prosecution Service to decide whether they upgrade the charge to murder following Kayleigh’s death.

Robinson, a former pupil of All Saints’ Academy, is due to next to appear at Gloucester Crown Court on May 9.

Robinson’s defence counsel did not request bail at Friday’s hearing. Members of the public in the gallery sobbed while Robinson was sitting in the dock.

One shouted: ‘Be strong,’ as he was taken to the cells. A spokesman for Gloucestershire Police said: ‘Emergency services were called to a house on Humber Road in the town just after midday on Wednesday.

‘A short while later a 16-year-old girl was taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, where she sadly died at around 11am on Saturday.’
