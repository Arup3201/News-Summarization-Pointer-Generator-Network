Paris Saint-Germain's Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani has brushed off criticism of his poor form, and promised to keep working hard.

Cavani, who has scored six times in 13 games so far this season without being at his best, admits he does not enjoy hearing 'negative things'.

But the striker, who was sent off in his last Ligue 1 appearance after a controversial goal celebration, knows it is part of the game, and says 'the only solution is work'.
