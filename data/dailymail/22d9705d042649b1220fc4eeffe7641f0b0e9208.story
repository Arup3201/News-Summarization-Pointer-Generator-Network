German motorists will be going green in more ways than one in the coming years when the country's longest autobahn is turned into a giant public park.

Part of the A7 will be covered with a 10ft-thick canopy in an attempt to reconnect districts in Hamburg which have been divided for nearly 30 years since the road was built.

The three-mile strip will stretch from the city's Schnelson district to Bahrenfeld and will be 100ft wide in some places.

Out of sight: How the autobahn will look once the project is complete. The motorway will run underneath in the hope of reducing noise pollution and re-connecting communities in the city

It is also hoped the $1billion project will tackle what has been a huge source of noise pollution in an area that sees more than 150,000 cars pass through each day. That number is expected to exceed 160,000 by 2025.

But the move is not without its critics, who fear the construction will cause major disruptions to traffic.

The motorway, which spans more than 500miles and provides a straight passage between Denmark and Austria, is not just important to Germany, but also much of Europe, it was reported on Treehugger.com.

Gardening plots in Bahrenfeld's south-east side will also be forced to relocate as a result of the development.

Blueprint: This cross-section shows how the park will stretch both lengthways (top) and widthways (bottom) over the lanes of traffic. Each section should take about four years to finish

Park life: The development at Stellingen will include a half-mile green space with a wooded area and community gardens

The project will involve building up the sides of the motorway so the canopy can be built over the lanes of traffic.

Work will start next year with the Stellingen district, where the half-mile park will include both a wooded parkland and community gardens.

The quarter-mile stretch in Schnelsen will boast a tree-lined promenade to offset the noise caused by the six lanes of traffic underneath.

Bahrenfeld hosts the longest canopy and 
will even see the construction of 1,700 new residential apartments. Each
section should take about four years to complete.

The A7 cover isn't the first of its kind, but it will be the largest in Germany. The upgrades are part of the Hamburg, European Green Capitol 2011 program.

The project, mostly financed by the federal government, will cost around $1billion.
