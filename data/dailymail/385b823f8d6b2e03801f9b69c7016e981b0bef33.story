Regrettable: Lego chief executive, Joergen Vig Knudstorp, said the company ‘should never have become part of Greenpeace’s dispute with Shell’

giant Shell following protests by Green campaigners.

The Danish toy maker has announced it will not renew a current deal allowing Shell to hand out Lego sets at its petrol stations in 30 countries, following a viral online campaign.

The campaign, which included a video showing an Arctic landscape with a Shell drilling platform made of Lego bricks covered in oil, was orchestrated by Greenpeace.

The three month campaign saw more than one million people signing a petition calling on the toy brand to stop promoting Shell’s brand because of the claimed damage that will be caused to the Arctic landscape.

Lego chief executive, Joergen Vig Knudstorp, explained the decision by saying the protest against plans by Shell to begin drilling in the Arctic next year ‘may have created misunderstandings among our stakeholders’.

He said green campaigners should take up their concerns directly with the oil company, adding that Lego ‘should never have become part of Greenpeace’s dispute with Shell’.

Mr Knudstorp said: ‘The long-term co-promotion contract we entered with Shell in 2011 delivers on the objective of bringing Lego bricks into the hands of many children, and we will honour it - as we would with any contract we enter.

But he added: ‘We continuously consider many different ways of how to deliver on our promise of bringing creative play to more children.

‘We want to clarify that as things currently stand we will not renew the co-promotion contract with Shell when the present contract ends.’

Lego refused to say when the current contract expires.

Greenpeace insisted the toy company was doing the right thing under public pressure and should choose its partners more carefully when it came to the threats facing children from climate change.

The environmental group is calling for a sanctuary to be created in the Arctic to protect it from drilling and industrial fishing, and for there to be no oil exploration in Arctic waters as the melting ice cap makes the fragile region more accessible.

Ian Duff, Arctic campaigner at Greenpeace, said: ‘This is a major blow to Shell. It desperately needs partners like LEGO to help give it respectability and repair the major brand damage it suffered after its last Arctic misadventure. Lego’s withdrawal from a 50 year relationship with Shell clearly shows that strategy will not work.’

Campaign: Greenpeace created a petition that was signed by more than a million people urging Lego to sever their relationship with Shell in response to the company's plans to drill for oil in the Arctic

He added: ‘LEGO’s decision couldn’t have come soon enough. The Arctic, and its incredible wildlife, like polar bears and narwhals, is under threat like never before.

‘Arctic sea ice is melting at an unprecedented rate, but instead of seeing the huge risks, oil companies like Shell are circling like vultures. Only weeks ago Shell gave us the clearest indication yet that it’s planning to go back to the Arctic as soon as next summer.’

Shell originally planned to drill around the Arctic coast of Alaska in 2013 and 2014, however it did not go ahead because of technical problems linked to the extreme weather.

End of an era: After 50 years working together, Shell will no longer be allowed to hand out Lego sets at its petrol stations

In August, it filed a revised Arctic offshore drilling plan with US regulators but said it has not decided whether to start in 2015.

Shell said: ‘Our latest co-promotion with Lego has been a great success and will continue to be as we roll it out in more countries across the world. We don’t comment on contractual matters.

‘We respect the right of individuals and organisations to engage in a free and frank exchange of views about meeting the world’s growing energy needs.

‘Recognising the right of individuals to express their point of view, we only ask that they do so in a manner that is lawful and does not place their safety or the safety of others at risk.’

The sets involved in the promotion include Lego racing cars and a Shell petrol station.
