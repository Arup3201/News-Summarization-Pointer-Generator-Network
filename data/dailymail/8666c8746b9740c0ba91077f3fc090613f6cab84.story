Pension demands: Christine Laird, 55, wants her payments topped up so she receives 85 per cent of her £88,000 per year final salary

A former council chief who has cost taxpayers more than £2million in a lengthy legal dispute yesterday demanded more cash.

Christine Laird, who has not worked since she took sick leave with stress more than seven years ago, claims she is still owed more than £100,000.

Mrs Laird, 55, joined Cheltenham Borough Council in 2002 but fell out with its political leaders and became ill in 2004. Her employment ceased a year later.

The council later lost a costly High Court case in which they accused her of failing to disclose a history of mental health problems.

Afterwards, the local authority apologised for wasting £2.1million of public money and a judge declared: 'I very much hope that a line can now finally be drawn.'

Mrs Laird, 55, now has an income of £56,000 a year, made up from a pension of £47,000, disability allowance of £8,000 and a £1,000 a year discretionary allowance.

But yesterday she said it was not enough.

The former council managing director said: 'Had I not become ill and lost my post I would now be earning around £170,000 per year.'

Appeal: Christine Laird is taking Cheltenham Borough Council to the Pensions Ombudsman

She is asking for payments including 
£48,000 interest on the £503,591 legal costs that the council were 
ordered to pay to her after she won the High Court case.

Mrs
Laird has also asked for a disability allowance paid since 2009 to be 
backdated to 2005 and for the council to continue to pay her nearly 
three-quarters of the £88,000 salary she was on when she left her job – 
£61,600 a year – until she is 65.
