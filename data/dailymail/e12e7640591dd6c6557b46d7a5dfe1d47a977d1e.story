North Carolina police have launched a manhunt for the killer of a 31-year-old teacher of the year who was found dead in her apartment.

The body of Maggie Daniels, 31, a popular school counselor at Discovery High School in Newton, was found around 10:30 a.m. Saturday in her Windsor Apartments home on West 17th Street.

On Monday, Newton Police Department said autopsy results suggested she'd been murdered though they have not released any information about cause of death or suspects or other leads in the case.

'The evidence obtained from the autopsy led us to a homicide investigation,' Newton Police Chief Donald Brown said at a press conference.

Officers arrived at Daniels' apartment complex around 9 a.m. Saturday responding to a call about property damage.

When they were there, neighbors alerted them to Daniels' body. Someone had reportedly tried to phone the teacher and went to check on her when she didn't respond.

A friend of Daniels' called 911 to express concern for her. The call was released Monday.

'One of my friends is in her apartment, and I think she's been in there for like a day,' the friend says in the recording, which was released Monday.

'She was in there laying down. I didn't even want to touch her... it shook me up when I seen her.'

She reportedly had no visible injuries, but there was a broken mirror nearby.

The janitor at the apartment complex, Joe McCorkle, said he last saw Daniels around 11 a.m. Friday and was there when police discovered her body.

'It just 
tore me up to pieces,' he told the Charlotte Observer, adding that the 
woman he referred to as 'the schoolteacher' was 'real nice' any time he 
waved hello.

'She was a good girl.'

Daniels moved into the apartment a year ago, he said.

He said she often left her door unlocked, which was unusual for the complex, and had a boyfriend who visited one or twice a month from South Carolina.

Investigators said they interviewed several people, and also checked video from surveillance cameras around downtown Newton to try and pinpoint when Daniels was last seen alive. They were also searching social media for leads, Fox 5 reported.

The Daniels' family said in a statement Monday night that they are in shock at the tragic news. 

'We are deeply saddened by the terrible news surrounding the death of our loved one, Maggie Daniels,' the statement reads. 'Words cannot describe the grief that we are going through right now. We, as a family, have decided not to comment while there is an ongoing investigation.'

The Discovery school community also expressed their devastation as word of the popular staff member's death spread.

'Our 
hearts are definitely broken,' Aron Gabriel, the assistant 
superintendent of the Newton-Conover City Schools district, told the 
Observer.

He said she was well-respected and loved as her school's only counselor.

In 2011, Daniels was named teacher of the year by the school district.

The Notre Dame College graduate moved from the Cleveland area to North Carolina in 2005 to teach English at Newton-Conover High School and also coached teh school's basketball team.

She left N-CHS to pursue a master’s degree in counseling from Appalachian State University and in 2013, she began counseling students at Discovery High School.

'It just seemed very natural to her,' Gabriel told the newspaper. 'I think she really was like a hand in a glove.'

Gabriel and his colleagues held a memorial Sunday so the community could greive and around 300 people attended.

'People realized they're part of a community,' he said. 'They're not by themselves.'
