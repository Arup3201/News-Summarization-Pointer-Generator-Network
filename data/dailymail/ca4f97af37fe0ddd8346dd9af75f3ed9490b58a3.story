Three teenage boys may have died in the shocking shooting at an Ohio school yesterday, but America could have been facing a greater tragedy if it wasn't for one teacher’s bravery.

Frank Hall, the assistant football coach at Chardon High School in Chardon, Ohio, charged down the shooter as a gun was pointed at him.

His students say the ‘tremendous’ father-of-four monitors study halls and ‘would take a bullet for us’ and do ‘anything to save his students’.

Hero: Frank Hall, assistant football coach at Chardon High School near Cleveland, Ohio, charged down the shooter as a gun was pointed at him

TJ Lane, 17, allegedly went on the rampage in the school cafeteria, killing Daniel Parmertor, 16, Russell King Jr, 17 and Demetrius Hewlin - and injuring two others.

The tragic incident took place at around 7:30am local time on Monday while students were in the cafeteria studying and eating breakfast.

But the shooting ended when Coach Hall chased Lane out of the school and many said this was unsurprising given his protective nature towards pupils.

'Coach Hall, he always talks about how much he cares about us students, his team and everyone,’ student Neil Thomas told CNN.

‘I think today (Monday) he really went out and he proved how much he cared about us,' Neil added. 'He would take a bullet for us.’

The suspect was caught about half an hour after the shooting with the help of citizens and a police dog, police said.

‘I’m actually not really shocked - (Coach Hall) is that kind of teacher who will do anything to save his students,’ student Madison Hess told Fox News.

Quarterback coach Don Navatsyk has worked with Coach Hall and the Hilltoppers football team for five years and said he is a ‘guy of faith’.

‘He’s a very nice guy,’ student Seanna 
Sicher told the Daily Beast. ‘He monitors study halls. What he did today
(Monday) was incredible.’

Other students said maths teacher Joseph 
Ricci, a father who has worked at the school for 19 years, should also 
be praised for his quick reactions on Monday morning.

Seanna said Mr Ricci took a wounded student into a classroom and gave him first aid until medics arrived, reported the Daily Beast.

Student Eric Myeroff said the teaching duo were ‘two of the greatest leaders in our school’ and it was no surprise they shone under pressure.

The shooting is the worst at a U.S. high school in 11 months and the worst in Ohio since late 2007, according to anti-gun violence campaigners.

The deadliest school shooting in the U.S. was the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech University that left 33 people dead.

But the worst high school shooting was the 1999 attack at Columbine High School in Colorado that killed 12 students and a teacher.

Chardon is a semi-rural, fairly well-educated and affluent town about 35 miles from Cleveland with a population of about 5,000.
