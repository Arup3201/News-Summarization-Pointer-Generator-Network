A prenuptial agreement, a Snowy owl named Hedwig, an unworn Vera Wang wedding dress worth £5,000 and a 
suitcase full of Prince George memorabilia are among the most peculiar items left behind in hotel rooms all over the country in 2013.

Also forgotten in the rush to check out were a pet tarantula called Hercules in his own bespoke travelling box, a six-foot piece of snake skin, a six-foot wooden cross, the deeds to a £2m house, a set of 24-carat gold Indian gods, and an unopened Vertu mobile phone worth £10,000.

A suitcase full of Geisha outfits, a set of trial yoghurt flavours from a major supermarket chain that have not yet been launched and a life-size cutout of TOWIE's Joey Essex also did time in the lost and found office for budget hotel chain Travelodge.

The company has today announced the most bizarre belongings left behind by some of the 16 million people who stayed in their 500 hotels over the past year.

Shakila Ahmed, Travelodge spokesman, said: 'Each year our lost and found inventory report provides plenty of revelations.

'From deeds to a £2 million house, a set of 24 carat gold Indian Gods and a Vertu mobile phone right through to a pet tarantula and even exclusive yoghurt flavours which have not even been launched to the public, it's evident what a cross section of people stay in our 500 hotels.'

She continued: 'Our 2013 left behind register also reveals how much smart technology has become a part of our everyday lives, as we have had nearly 10,000 tablets and smartphones left behind in our hotels in the last 12 months. This is a significant increase from previous years.

'What is becoming evident after speaking to our customers is that the pace of life has become so fast and we are so eager to get from A to B that valuable posessions are easily being forgotten.'

All items left behind in Travelodge hotels which have not been claimed within three months, are donated to local charity shops.

Travelodge
 has also reported that during the last 12 months, 22,648 books have 
been left behind in 38,000 of its hotel rooms. The most popular book
