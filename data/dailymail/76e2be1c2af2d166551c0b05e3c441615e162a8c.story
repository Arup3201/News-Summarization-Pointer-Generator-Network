A celebrated sculptor is designing a statue in tribute to a doctor who performed pioneering plastic surgery on his father's burned face saving him from a lifetime of horrendous disfigurement.

Martin Jennings' father Michael suffered horrific burns during the Second World War and was discovered in hospital by surgeon Archibald McIndoe.

A lieutenant in the 15/19 Hussars he had suffered the devastating effects of a tank blaze in October 1944 which had melted the skin on much of his face and hands.

horrifically burned during the Second World War and was discovered in 
hospital by surgeon Archibald McIndoe who went on to transform his melted face

Now Mr Jennings, who created the sculpture of Sir John Betjeman in St Pancras Station, is creating a lasting memorial to the surgeon, who he credits with saving his father's life.  

When it's finished the statue will sit in East Grinstead, West Sussex, where McIndoe was based at a small cottage hospital. The town became known as 'the 
town that did not stare', as his disfigured and recovering patients went about trying to rebuild their lives.

Mr Jennings junior, from Oxfordshire, said he only fully 
appreciated what McIndoe had done for his father when he visited the hospital recently and saw 
photographs of his father's face before and after surgery.

His father rarely spoke of the devastating blaze but once described the way fire filled the tank as 'like a Pentecostal wind' when the shell hit it.

He was awarded the Military Cross as he went back to the burning tank to get medication for his men which made his injuries all the worse.

McIndoe had found him bandaged from 
head to toe with only a hole for his mouth, in a Birmingham hospital and
immediately ordered him to be moved to West Sussex where he began to treat him.

At the time Mr Jennings thought his life was over, but after surgery he remarkably went on to become a teacher and 
then headmaster, having 11 children in total.

Mr Jennings junior told the Guardian: 'Without Mac none of us might be here'.

Faced with injuries that surgeons at the
time had little experience of, New Zealander McIndoe came up with 
innovative ways of treating injured airmen who, because of the 
experimental nature of the work being done on them, became known as 
Guinea Pigs.

The Guinea Pig Club, which by the end of
the war had 649 members, was formed and was McIndoe's effort to make life easier for 
the soldiers by getting them to integrate with local people.

Now in their 80s and 90s, they were 
regularly seen about town defying their injuries, attending dances, 
drinking in pubs and watching films. Many went on to marry local girls 
and nurses who treated them.

When
the war began, the cottage hospital in East Grinstead, essentially a 
prefabricated building, expanded and became known as the Queen Victoria,
establishing a specialist burns centre, which remains so today.

McIndoe, who died in 1960 aged 60, created the Blond McIndoe 
Research Foundation, a medical research centre based at the hospital which specialised in skin 
wound repair. It opened a year after his death.

Jacquie
Pinney, chief executive of the foundation, said: 'People in the 
hospital know of McIndoe and his work but there is no permanent memorial
to him in the town which was so much a part of his work and the 
rehabilitation of these men.'

Many of the 
techniques McIndoe developed, when plastic surgery was in its infancy, 
are still used to save the lives of burns patients.

His
major innovation was his method of removing dead skin and replacing it 
with skin taken from other parts of the patient's body.

McIndoe
believed cutting away the unhealthy skin within two weeks under 
anesthetic produced better results  -  this is something that has become
standard procedure.

The
surgeon also recognised the need to deal with the psychological trauma 
of his patients, many of whom would be in hospital for years.
