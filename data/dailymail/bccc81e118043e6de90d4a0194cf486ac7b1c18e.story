A California man has been convicted of killing his wife after a court heard how he stabbed his wife to death with scissors as she held their baby son.  

A jury convicted 47-year-old Todd Winkler in October of first-degree murder in the death of 37-year-old Rachel Winkler, The Sacramento Bee reported. 

He was sentenced to 26 years behind bar.

Speaking out: Don Hatfield is seen speaking in court while Todd Winkler, in orange, listens on Monday 

Rachel Winkler's father Don Hatfield reportedly told the courtoom of his grandchildren 'Those beautiful children were orphaned in one cruel deed. How will I ever explain, or even comment, on the question: "Why did Daddy kill Mommy?"'

The Sacramento Bee reported that Todd Winkler claimed in his trial that Rachel Winkler's neck was stabbed with scissors in self-defense as the couple engaged in a verbal fight on February 27, 2012 about a divorce.

Rachel Winkler's affair with a Cameron Airpark co-worker was also included in the trial, according to the newspaper.

The couple's children - Eva, Ariel and Alex - are now being parented by Don Hatfield, The Sacramento Bee reported.

The grandfather reportedly recounted Eva's and Alex's trauma in the wake of the slaying. 

According to The Sacramento Bee, Hatfield claimed Eva yells 'Mommy, don’t leave me! Mommy, don’t leave me! Mommy, don’t leave me!' after waking up in the evening.

The newspaper also reported that Hatfield expressed anger over both his daughter's affair with 46-year-old James White and her husband's mental health issues being used by the defense.

Convicted: Todd Winkler faces a sentence of 26 years behind bars. He is seen in court on Monday 

'I had to listen while Rachel was portrayed...as a sick, incompetent, wayward drunk who cared little for her children and was impossible to please,' Hatfield said, according to The Sacramento Bee. 'Nothing could be further from the truth. 

'I fell into deep despair and depression, thinking only of the one juror who would believe this stuff. In the end, none of them did.'

Later in court, Todd Winkler said 'I would just say, your honor, that I feel deep remorse for what’s happened, for Rachel’s family and for my family and, especially, for Rachel,' the newspaper reported.

Rachel Winkler's longtime friend Shannon Thurman spoke Monday in court, according to The Sacramento Bee. 

Her brother David Hatfield's written statement was reportedly read to the court by her father.
