An eight-year-old boy collapsed and died after an asthma attack at a friend's birthday party, an inquest heard.

Adam Mark Winfandale, who used two inhalers to manage the illness, was rushed to hospital on June 5, 2011 and was pronounced dead on arrival.

He was having fun with pals at a Quasar laser quest event in Chester when he suffered breathing difficulties.

An inquest jury at Warrington Town Hall heard yesterday how Adam's mother, Susan Jones, said despite his asthma he was a healthy boy who enjoyed tennis, swimming lessons and doing activities with the Cubs and Scouts.

Tragedy: Adam Winfandale collapsed and died after an asthma attack at a friend's birthday party

'Adam's asthma was very manageable,' she said. 'We had never had a panic moment. I always had a warning with his asthma, as it was always a slow build up.'

But on Sunday June 5, Adam left his home at Bryn Celyn, Moss, Wrexham, north Wales, to join his friends at Quasar and died after encountering breathing difficulties.

A parent at the party, Janet Ellams, said Miss Jones had explained to her about Adam's asthma and had given his inhaler to her.

'He won't need it, it's just in case,' Miss Jones said. 'He will know when he needs it and how much he can take.'

The children arrived at Quasar at 11am and were given a health and safety briefing where Adam was asked about his asthma and if he was fine to play. Staff deemed he was able to play and the game began.

Ms Ellams said: 'About 15 minutes in Adam came out and said he needed his inhaler. He seemed quite calm when he came out. He was standing against the wall and wanting to get back into the game.'

Miss Jones was called and told Adam had asked for his inhaler and she said her son would know what to do.

But Adam said the inhaler was not working and became distressed and agitated.

The hearing was told Adam's condition worsened in just a matter of minutes. An ambulance was called and Adam was carried outside for more air. Witnesses said he was rigid and his lips and hands were blue.

The ambulance arrived in one minute and Adam was treated immediately en route to the Countess of Chester Hospital.

Miss Jones was called and headed straight to the hospital to see her son but Adam was pronounced dead at the hospital at 3.20pm.

Adam Salmon, co-owner of Quasar, told the hearing the game Adam was playing usually involved smoke, music and lighting.

But on this occasion the liquid smoke machine was not working and had been broken for a couple of weeks.

Mr Salmon said there could have been some particles in the air which could have been a contributory factor to Adam's asthma attack.

During the inquest Adam's parents raised concerns about whether Quasar had good health and safety policies in place.

But Helen Stott, lead environmental health practitioner for Cheshire West and Chester Council, said Quasar had followed all health and safety rules and complied with all relevant legislation.

In the week leading up to the party Adam had been on holiday with Miss Jones in Majorca and had no asthma or breathing troubles.

They returned on Saturday, June 4 and Adam was described as being 'very well'.

The inquest, before Cheshire assistant deputy coroner Alan Moore, continues.
