A campaign to raise money for a baby girl set to lose all her limbs to meningitis has reached its £40,000 fundraising target in just two weeks.

Harmonie-Rose Allen, from Bath in Somerset, suffered one of the worst cases of the deadly illness  doctors had ever seen, and was put on life-support.

Despite being given just a 10 per cent chance of survival she recovered - but at just 11 months old is losing her arms and legs because they became so infected with the bug.  

The Hope for Harmonie campaign reached its £40,000 target in a fortnight and will pay for prosthetic limbs

Harmonie-Rose underwent her first amputations at Bristol Children's Hospital last Thursday when surgeons removed her right leg above the knee and her right arm below the elbow.

Doctors are monitoring her progress and the second amputations are scheduled for tomorrow.

Her parents Freya Hall and Ross Allen launched the Hope for Harmonie appeal to raise £40,000 for prosthetic limbs so she can live as normal a life as possible. 

The campaign has raised more than £40,000 in a fortnight and a fun day on Saturday boosted it by a further £16,000. 

Hundreds of well-wishers attended the event at St Andrew's Community Church in Foxhill, Bath, Somerset.

Her mother, Freya, 20, said today: 'She's strong so I have to be strong too. She's doing well, she's really stable.

'It's still Harmonie, she's my little Harmonie and she's looking at us and interacting. She's saying her name and 'mum'.

'We're all at the hospital, ready for the operation tomorrow. We're optimistic. We're just being positive that she's going to do well again. It doesn't matter what she's like, she will adapt.

'Whatever happens, she will adapt because she's shown so much strength already. She's going to be amazing.'

She will need two pairs of prosthetics,  home modifications and specialised equipment following the operations

Harmonie-Rose suffered with one of the worst cases of meningitis doctors had ever seen

Harmonie-Rose will need two pairs of prosthetics, as well as home modifications and specialised equipment. 

Her aunt Hannah Hall said: 'The money will all be for Harmonie through her lifetime, items that are not available on the NHS.

'It gives Harmonie the life that all children deserve. One day, we will all observe Harmonie take those first long awaited steps on prosthetic legs.'

Ms Hall and Mr Allen, a customer service worker, first noticed something was wrong on September 27 when Harmonie woke in the night coughing and unable to breathe.

They took her to the Royal United Hospital in Bath but doctors could not find anything seriously wrong and she was sent home.

Doctors are monitoring Harmonie's progress - the second amputations are scheduled for tomorrow

But the next morning Harmonie turned blue and they took her back to the same hospital.

Following a thorough assessment they were told it was just a virus and were again sent home.

But hours later Harmonie became floppy and lethargic and they rushed back to the hospital, where a rash was spotted.

She was then rushed by ambulance to specialist unit at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children.

By the time she arrived at the intensive care unit her arms and legs had turned black and her parents were told all four limbs would need to be amputated.

Her mother  said today, 'She's strong so I have to be strong too. She's doing well, she's really stable'

At the time Mr Allen said: 'She had been a little bit under the weather all week.

'But we just assumed it was a cold and because she was teething we put it down to that as well.

'We took her to hospital and we were sent home, and the same again the next day. But then she went all limp and she was blue.

'She was rushed to the children's hospital. It was absolutely horrible. She was really lucky to survive.

'Doctors told us it was the worst case they had seen in three years and they really didn't think she would make the journey to the hospital. She's a little fighter.'
