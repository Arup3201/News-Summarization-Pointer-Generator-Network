A gang who staged a dawn raid on a 51-year-old's home this morning battered their victim senseless while he slept before pouring petrol over him.

Several men were being hunted by detectives following the brutal attack on Robbie Sinclair  at 5.30am at the house  in Didcot, Oxfordshire.

Neighbours told how the men stormed in and beat Mr Sinclair so severely he suffered critical head injuries and is now fighting for his life in hospital.

Firefighters evacuated at least three neighbours living in the multi-occupancy five-bedroom house, as well as residents from elsewhere on the street.

Detectives sealed off the road where the attack took place and a forensics team removed a blood-covered duvet.

It is thought Mr Sinclair might have known at least one of his attackers.

Neighbours said they heard Mr Sinclair shouting 'get them out - they’re going to blow up the house' before the suspects fled in a car that was parked nearby.

One neighbour, a woman aged in her 40s who did not want to be named, said: 'I saw two police officers in riot gear and shields. They bashed down the doors of three of the five rooms in the house.

'It was clear the people they were after had already left.

'When police were taking statements I heard one of the tenants telling an officer that Robbie was hurt and he had shouted: "Get them out. They’re going to blow up the house".

'This was after he had been attacked. I saw him on a stretcher. He had blood coming from his head and neck. I thought he had been stabbed.

'Nothing like this normally happens around here. It is usually really quiet.'

Other locals said they had heard several arguments outside the house concerning a faulty car on Friday evening. They said several different vehicles were parked on the driveway of the semi-detached house every week.

'I’ve heard a few arguments coming from that house,' said a 55-year-old neighbour, who also did not want to be identified. 'That was on Friday. Someone was shouting: "You sold me a dog".

'There are lots of different cars there every week. I’ve seen two men working on them on the driveway, jacked up and that.'

Investigation: Neighbours living on the street were evacuated from their homes for an hour while police took statements from other occupants of the house

Mr Sinclair was taken to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford by ambulance where police said he was in a critical condition.

Detectives said they were seeking a number of people in relation to the early morning assault and appealed for any witnesses to contact them urgently.

Neighbours living close to the semi-detached house were evacuated for about an hour as the fire brigade ensured the area was safe following the petrol incident.

Another neighbour added: 'I heard some people being let into the house and a car engine was running outside at about 5.30am.

'It all kicked off after that. I’ve never seen so many emergency services here before. I hope Robbie pulls through.'

Detective Inspector John Turner, of Thames Valley Police, said that police were called by the ambulance service at 6.18am.

He added: 'The investigation into this incident is at a very early stage and we have not established how the man came to be injured. However we are treating it as assault at this time.'
