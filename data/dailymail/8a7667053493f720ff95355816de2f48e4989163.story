These photographs show an adorable four-day-old gorilla making its public debut in front of an enraptured crowd.

The baby primate - whom zookeepers have yet to name - clung to its mother Jessica as she wandered around an enclosure in San Diego Zoo.

The newborn male was shown off up-close to spectators when Jessica came up close to the glass, cradling the little one in her arms.

Paul Donn, the baby's father, was also on hand to watch over his son, who weighs just a few pounds. 

Zookeepers say Jessica has been cradling and nursing the baby since he was born on December 26. She also carries the little one around as she forages for food.

Jessica has five other offspring, but this is her first with Paul Donn, who is a now four-time father.
