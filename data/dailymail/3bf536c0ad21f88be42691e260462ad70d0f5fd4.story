Taking to the water for the first time, the stunning £400million megayacht is one of the largest and most expensive ever to be built.

Four years of work have gone into creating the huge boat which is the brainchild of a British designer based, ironically, in landlocked Rutland.

But despite the conspicuous size of the yacht, named Topaz, the identity of its owner remains shrouded in secrecy.

The stunning megayacht is one of the largest and most expensive ever to be built

At 147-metres, it is the fourth longest yacht ever built and a mere 15-metres shorter than Roman Abramovich's Eclipse, which currently holds the bragging rights.

The vessel also boasts a weight thought to be in excess of 12,000 tonnes.

Whoever the lucky owner is, they are likely to have very deep pockets.

The identity of the billionaire customer 
is unknown with Lurssen, the boat's manufacturer, unwilling to discuss personal clients due to 
strict confidentiality agreements.

Topaz is understood to have been the work of British designer Tim Heywood, who is based in Rutland

The mystery customer is expected to be paying upwards of £300 million for the elegant vessel

As a result, details surrounding the yacht remain sketchy, but a vessel of this size is anticipated to have a price tag of between £300 to £400million.

Topaz is understood to have been the work of British designer Tim Heywood.

The 62-year-old, who has been in the industry for 40 years, has played a major role in producing some of the world's finest yachts.

From his office overlooking Rutland Water, he has designed the likes of the 133-metre 'Mirqab', which was named 2009 yacht of the year, and Roman Abramovich's old boat, the 115-metre Pelorus.

Mr Abramovich's latest vessel, the 163.5m Eclipse, is about to be - well - eclipsed by a 180m monster known only as Project Azzam.

Ousted: But Mr Abramovich is about to lose his title as the owner of the world's largest private yacht - after this incredible vessel was spotted in Germany last month

On the move: The yacht, which was minus its bow 
section, was quickly taken to the larger 220-metre dock so engineers 
could continue the awesome project

Huge: Eclipse, owned by Chelsea Football Club owner Mr Abramovich, has two swimming pools, two helipads, a gym, hair salon, dancefloor and a 007-style submarine

It is rumoured the boat, which is longer than some cruise ships, has been commissioned by the Saudi Royal Family.

Stunned
 photographers captured the vessel earlier this month as it was transported out of the 
170-metre dry dock at Lurssen's yard... because it had 
become too large.
