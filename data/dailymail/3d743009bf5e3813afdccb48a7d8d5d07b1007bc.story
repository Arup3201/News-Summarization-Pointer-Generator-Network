A plane passenger punched a pilot in the face then attacked him again with his brother before they were tackled by bystanders, officials said.

Jonathan and Luis Baez, both of Las Piedras, Puerto Rico, were arrested last night at Miami Airport after leaving a flight bound for San Francisco.

The pilot suffered cuts and bruises to his face and blurred vision, and was afraid Luis Baez would follow through on a death threat, police said.

The incident arose after a flight attendant noticed Jonathan Baez was unresponsive and appeared to be intoxicated or on drugs, police said.

The Baez brothers had been aboard American Airlines Flight 1755 bound for the California city on Wednesday night, an arrest affidavit said.

While the plane taxied away from the gate, a flight attendant noticed Jonathan Baez was sleeping and had not buckled his seat belt, police said.

The attendant tried to wake him, but told police that Jonathan Baez was unresponsive and appeared to be intoxicated or on drugs.

‘As we always do with these things, 
we'd much rather deal with it on the ground than in the air. He was apparently barely compliant 
at that point. He was exhibiting symptoms of intoxication. He was not 
walking well when he went up the aisle'

The pilot turned the plane around and returned to a gate before Jonathan Baez was woken up and told to get off the plane, police said.

‘As we always do with these things, we'd much rather deal with it on the ground than in the air,’ an American Airlines spokesman said.

‘He was apparently barely compliant at that point,' the spokesman alleged. 'He was exhibiting symptoms of intoxication. He was not walking well when he went up the aisle.'

Luis Baez, 29, joined his brother as he was being escorted off, but they allegedly became angry as they walked toward the exit door.

He allegedly told the pilot: ‘When you fly to San Juan I will have you killed.’

‘There was a scuffle that took place,
so about three or four of us went out there and tackled the guys. There
were two of them and I guess the pilot ended up with some contusions on
his face. So we just did what we needed to do to help out'

The brothers walked off the plane, but then Jonathan Baez returned and allegedly punched the pilot in the face.

He then hit the flight attendant in the shoulder when she tried to intervene, police said.

Both brothers attacked the pilot again in the jet bridge and chased him in the terminal, the arrest report said.

Other flight crew members and passengers held down the brothers until police arrived.

‘There was a scuffle that took place, so about three or four of us went out there and tackled the guys,’ witness Ken Venting told KGO-TV.

‘There were two of them and I guess the pilot ended up with some contusions on his face. So we just did what we needed to do to help out.’

‘I think it's fair to say that both these gentlemen won't be flying with us again'

American Airlines spokesman

Another pilot filled in and flew the plane carrying 176 passengers and six crew members to San Francisco International Airport.

Jonathan Baez was held in the Miami-Dade County Jail on Thursday on $9,000 bond on charges of battery and aggravated battery.

Luis Baez was held on $12,500 bond on charges of aggravated assault and aggravated battery.

‘I think it's fair to say that both these gentlemen won't be flying with us again,’ the American Airlines spokesman said.
