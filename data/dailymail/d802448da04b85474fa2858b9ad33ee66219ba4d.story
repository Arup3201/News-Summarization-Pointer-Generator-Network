Everton manager Roberto Martinez has reiterated his desire to re-sign Chelsea forward Romelu Lukaku.

Belgium international Lukaku scored 15 Premier League goals during his time at Goodison Park and is facing an uncertain future at parent club Chelsea.

The Blues are said to be willing to cash in on the Belgium international if they receive a bid in the region of £18million for the 21-year-old.

And Toffees boss Martinez has declared he would love to bring Lukaku back to Everton if Chelsea do decide to sell the former Anderlecht striker.

Martinez, speaking to talkSPORT, said on Lukaku: 'Rom fits in really, really well at Goodison. We created a fantastic bond with the player, and the player with the fans, and that is something that we would love to extend.

'Whatever happens in the future, at the moment there is not much we can speak about.'

Lukaku, who is currently training with former side Anderlecht in a bid to get fully for the new season, could be allowed to leave Stamford Bridge if Didier Drogba rejoins Jose Mourinho's side before the new Premier League campaign.
