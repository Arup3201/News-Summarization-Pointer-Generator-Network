Rape and sex crimes on U.S. military bases have risen alarmingly in recent years, with many survivors afraid to come forward for fear of ruing their career or facing retaliation.

In an interview with NBC’s Rock Center With Brian Williams, several servicemen and women, including former Marine Claire Russo, spoke out about their ordeals with trying to find justice within the military.

The 32-year-old former intelligence officer said that she was sexually assaulted in 2004 at a Marine Corps ball after a fellow Marine allegedly drugged her. Though she begged him to stop, she said he continued to sodomise her on the bathroom floor.

Desire: NBC spoke to several military women who had been assaulted, all of whom said they still wished to serve their country

The special, which aired in full Thursday at 10pm on NBC, looks at the growing epidemic of rape and sexual assault in the military. According to Defence Secretary Leon Panetta, there were over 19,000 cases of abuse or rape in 2010 alone.

Russo told NBC’s Natalie Morales that she attended the Marine Corps Ball in San Diego in 2004 with her cousin. While at the gathering, she met Doug Dowson, another Marine. She said that he offered her a drink, but then things began to get hazy for her.

Though a drug test was inconclusive, Russo was convinced that she had been drugged. She said the next thing she remembered was Dowson taking her to the bathroom and sodomising her. ‘At that point, I was just crying and begging him to stop,’ she said.

Russo said that the day after the rape, she was at the military facility waiting to get a rape kit done, but her cousin told her to instead go to a civilian hospital instead, saying the military establishment lacked equipment, skill, and personnel to handle running a rape kit.

Spiral of silence: Victims of sex crimes in the military are often afraid to report the attacks for fear of retribution

Staggering: Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said that there were more than 19,000 sexual assaults in the U.S. military in 2010 alone

According to NBC, the military declined to charge Dowson, despite forensic evidence and testimony, as well as photos corroborating Russo’s story. She said the Marines discouraged her from taking her case to the D.A.

The
Department of Defence estimates that more than 19,000 military men and 
women were sexually assaulted by fellow troops in 2010 alone while 
serving in the U.S. armed forces.

At
least 20 per cent of servicewomen and one per cent of men - an 
estimated 500,000 troops - have experienced sexual trauma while serving.

In most cases, a rape
victim’s only judicial recourse is to report the attack to his or her 
commander, even if it was the officer who attacked them, and it is the 
officer’s decision whether or not to investigate and prosecute.

A police investigation of Dowson’s 
house revealed hidden cameras hidden throughout the residence and 
hundreds of hours of footage of him having sex with incapacitated 
victims. He plead guilty to Russo’s sodomy and was sentenced to three 
years in prison.

He served 18 months of his term. Russo said: ‘The only thing that makes my story extraordinary is that I got justice’

Her story is one of thousands more. 
At the Lackland Air Force Base in Texas, an Air Force basic training 
instructor has been sentenced to 45 days' confinement for being sexually
involved with a female trainee on the scandal-ridden base.

Staff Sgt Jason Manko was sentenced 
earlier this week after pleading guilty to wrongfully seeking an 
intimate relationship and wrongfully engaging in sexual activity with a 
trainee.

Manko also was reduced to an airman 
first class during a special court-martial at the Lackland base in San 
Antonio. He was ordered to forfeit $500 in pay per month for three 
months and given 30 days' hard labor.

He's among more than a dozen 
instructors investigated in a scandal that led to charges against six. 
Manko is the fifth to be sentenced.

More than 40 women have been identified as victims, but the investigation is on-going and could reveal more.
