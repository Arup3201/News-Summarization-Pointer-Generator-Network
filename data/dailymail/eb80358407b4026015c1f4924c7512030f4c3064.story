A woman who weighed 300lbs has managed to drop more than half her weight, despite suffering from deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a severe blood-clotting condition.

Sasha George, a 42-year-old artist and mother of two in Orange County, California, was diagnosed with the debilitating condition in 2002 while pregnant with her second child.

'I kept getting the clots and having surgery to annihilate them, only to have them come back,' she recalls in a blog post on The Huffington Post, adding that she weighed 300lbs by the time her son was born.

Half her size: Sasha George, a 42-year-old artist and mother of two in Orange County, California, dropped 153lbs despite suffering from deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a severe blood-clotting condition 

Weighty matter: Though once skinny, she weighed 300lbs by the time her son was born

'My legs were so swollen, which kept me from doing any activities. I'd watch as my husband took the children to all their school events and outings,' she said.

'It only took five minutes if I stood before my damaged leg reminded me I was chained to the problem. I knew then I couldn't get a job; I'd be a liability.'

Ms George had always been skinny in her youth, but began to struggle with her weight in 1992 when a full-fusion spinal surgery for scoliosis left her bed-ridden for nearly a year, and when she gave birth to her first child in 1993.

Prior to her DVT diagnosis she weighed 170lbs and still considered herself in good shape. But as her health problems worsened, and she began to have trouble breathing, she became determined to find a way to get fit.

'The reality that I could be taken from this world awakened my survival instinct,' she wrote. 'The doctors told me I had to make the decision to live or let my condition win.'

Despite being confined to her chair for long periods of time, she began using leg weights to lift her feet off the floor and lifting books to give her arms a workout. She squeezed her ab muscles in for ten seconds at a time, and within a few months was taking short walks down her driveway and back.

Healthy eating: She also modified her diet, avoiding dairy and focusing on fruits and vegetables

Breakthrough: 'The reality that I could be taken from this world awakened my survival instinct,' she wrote. 'The doctors told me I had to make the decision to live or let my condition win'

She modified her diet, avoiding dairy and focusing on fruits and vegetables. She was also forced to reduce her intake of vitamin K, which makes blood thicken.

Ms George is now able to run for an entire hour, having shed a whopping 153lbs.

'I do anything to at least keep my body feeling it is challenged,' she wrote. 'My goal is 130lbs, and I'm going to do everything in my power to keep the weight off.'

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 300,000-600,000 people are diagnosed with DVT each year in the United States, and 60,000-100,000 die from the condition.

About 30per cent of people who have had a DVT are at risk for another episode.
