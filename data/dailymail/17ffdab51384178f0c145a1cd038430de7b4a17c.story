Commons Speaker John Bercow is under mounting pressure to delay the appointment of a controversial Australian as Parliament’s most senior official, amid a growing outcry from MPs.

Former foreign secretaries Jack Straw and Margaret Beckett have added their voices to a cross-party campaign to let MPs grill Mr Bercow’s top choice to become the next House of Commons clerk.

It came after Carol Mills finally broke her silence over the controversy surrounding her proposed appointment.

Commons Speaker John Bercow is under pressure to let MPs grill the Australian Parliamentary aide Carol Mills, who is the front runner to become the new House of Commons clerk

Ms Mills, a senior aide in the Australian Parliament in Canberra, said she was ‘disappointed’ that colleagues in Australia had declared that she had ‘no parliamentary knowledge or experience’.

It came after an email was leaked from the Australian clerk of the Senate, Rosemary Laing, to the Commons authorities which warned against her appointment.

Responding to the memo Ms Mills said: ‘It would not be appropriate for me to comment further in a personal capacity at this time,’ she said.

‘As a senior parliamentary officer, I take seriously my responsibilities to promote and uphold the values and code of conduct articulated in the Commonwealth of Australia Parliamentary Service Act 1999.’

Ms Laing apparently cited an incident in which CCTV cameras were used in the Australian Parliament to track someone pushing an envelope under the door of a senator's office late at night.

The episode is being investigated, as cameras are supposed to be used only for security and to prosecute illegal activity.

But Ms Mills said her Department of Parliamentary Services ‘looks forward to the opportunity to explain to the committee the basis of its view that use of the CCTV footage was in fact authorised, and wholly consistent with parliamentary privilege’.

Former Commons Speaker Baroness Boothroyd has slammed the proposed appointment of Ms Mills

Baroness Boothroyd, a former House of Commons speaker, said Ms Mills' statement ‘underlines the urgent need for the Prime Minister to reconsider her proposed appointment as clerk of the House of Commons’.

She added: ‘Mr Cameron should postpone a decision until widespread concerns about her suitability to fill an important constitutional position at Westminster are properly addressed.’

A growing number of MPs have called for Ms Mills to face a confirmation hearing in front of MPs before she can take up the role.

Ms Mills is believed to have been recommended for the prestigious role following a recruitment process with a selection panel led by Mr Bercow.

But concerns have been raised about her ability to fulfil the crucial role in which she will advise the Speaker and Prime Minster over constitutional matters.

Baroness Boothroyd has claimed she would be ‘totally out of her depth’ in the role.

Public Administration Committee chairman Bernard Jenkin has written to David Cameron asking him to publicly back letting MPs scrutinise Ms Mills.

Former Commons leader and Foreign Secretary Jack Straw backed the move.

He told The Guardian: ‘Given the controversy, and without making any observations about the relative merits of the candidate, I think that such pre-appointment scrutiny would be a good way of resolving this.’

Mrs Beckett, who also served as leader of the Commons, told the newspaper: ‘These days you cannot make an appointment like this without select committee scrutiny.’

The £200,000-a-year position combines the role of clerk of the House of Commons and chief executive responsible for running the building and managing almost 2,000 staff.

Critics have said that while Ms Mills' may be a suitable candidate for the chief executive element of the job, they are concerned about her ability to advise MPs, the Speaker and Prime Minister on constitutional matters.

Mr Bercow - who has attempted to drive a significant modernisation of the Commons - has come under fire for overlooking the respected deputy clerk David Natzler.

But his allies have defended the way it was handled, with an open recruitment process and lengthy interviews for the shortlisted candidates.

Mr Bercow chaired the appointment panel which also included Andrew Lansley - who subsequently lost his job as Commons leader in the reshuffle - shadow leader Angela Eagle, Labour chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee Margaret Hodge and Liberal Democrat John Thurso.

Mr Bercow's spokeswoman said: ‘This is the first time ever there has been an open and fair recruitment process for the clerk of the House of Commons.’

Former Foreign Secretaries Margaret Beckett and Jack Straw have called for Ms Mills to appear in front of a Parliamentary committee to scrutinise her appointment

Eight candidates were interviewed, with a shortlist of three called back for a second round of grilling by the panel.

The successful candidate's name is understood to have been put forward to Downing Street to subsequently recommend to the Queen.

The vacancy has arisen because of the retirement of Commons veteran Sir Robert Rogers amid claims he has clashed with the Speaker.

Tory MP Michael Fabricant, who claimed in the Commons last month that Mr Bercow had once told Sir Robert to ‘f*** off’ in front of witnesses - an allegation immediately denied by Mr Bercow - said the Speaker should consider resigning.

On Twitter he said: ‘If I were Bercow, I'd be thinking about my own position, let alone considering what to do about the rigged appointment of the new Clerk.’

Sir Robert has put in place a plan for when he retires at the end of the month, with Mr Natzler acting up as clerk until the new appointment is in place.

He said the plans ‘are resilient’ and that ‘we could go to the election without a problem. I'm quite sure we would be fine’.
