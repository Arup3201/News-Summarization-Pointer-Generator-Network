Nathan Dyer has been told his future lies at Swansea even though manager Garry Monk has left him out of his last three match-day squads.

Dyer started the season on fire with three goals in as many Barclays Premier League games and was reported to be in international contention when England manager Roy Hodgson paid a visit to the Liberty Stadium in September.

But Dyer's form has tailed off since that blistering start and he is now behind fellow widemen Wayne Routledge and Jefferson Montero in the Liberty Stadium pecking order.

The 27-year-old winger has even failed to make the bench for Swansea's last three games against Manchester United, Burnley and Tottenham but Monk explained that was down to him changing his customary 4-3-3 formation to one featuring a midfield diamond.

'These are very difficult decisions for me,' Monk explained.

'Nathan had a fantastic start to the season, he had a little dip and then he came back a bit.

'He has probably been a bit more inconsistent but he has still contributed fantastically to the team. There are no problems whatsoever with Nathan.

'He is one who does deserve to be in match-day squads but unfortunately with the way things are sometimes that isn't always possible.

'The formation we've been playing dictates the bench, you have to look what you need and there are normally three or four players who miss out.'

Dyer has made over 200 league appearances for Swansea since signing from Monk's former club Southampton in a £400,000 deal in 2009.

The Wiltshire-born winger helped the club win promotion to the Premier League in 2011 and has been a consistent performer in the top flight - and Monk insists he still has a big part to play at Swansea.

'I have known him since he was 14 and watched his career, I know him better than probably anyone else in the squad,' Monk said.

'Nathan has contributed a lot this season, he is a fantastic player to work with and someone who is at a very good level.

'He is a big part of what I am doing here but there are moments within seasons where you miss out.

'We have four good wide players in Jeff, Wayne and Nathan and Mo Barrow coming through, they are all different types who can contribute different things and selection depends on who we are playing and how the players have trained.

'These decisions are never easy - it's probably the hardest part of the job - but I am always honest with the players and I think they respect that.'
