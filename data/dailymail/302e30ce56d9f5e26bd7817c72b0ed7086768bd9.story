Of course you love them, but you’d probably rather not travel large distances with them. Children and babies are probably the most stressful additions to any journey. 

They kick and scream and cry and complain and repeat the cycle at varying volumes until you reach your destination.

While there’s little you can do solve the problem in its entirety - save leave them behind - there are a few things you can do to prevent some of the worst tantrums and forearm yourself for the open road.

Happy families: Travelling with children is hellish but there are things you can do to prevent the worst tantrums

1.) Book seats by the plane’s engine

Who’d have guessed it? One of the best things to rock-a-bye-baby is the roar of an engine. According to The Art of Manliness, who swear by the tip given to them by from an experienced air stewardess, although the engine is loud; ‘the womb was incredibly loud too – and they’ll think they’re back in their happy place.’

As an engine’s location varies from plane to plane  you’ll need to find out what type of plane you are flying in then use Google to see where that aircraft’s engines are located before choosing your seat.

Out for the count: Choose a seat that's close to the plane's engine if travelling with a baby to make them sleep

2.) Surprise present

TV presenter and consumer champion Sarah Willingham has a useful trick to stem the bawling if you’re little one has past the point of no return.

Before you get into the car/train/plane secretly wrap up one of their favourite toys without telling them. At the right moment hand it over for them to unwrap. It can't fail to make them smile and will calm them down quickly.

3.) Do your homework

There are a few sites such as Skyscanner and Seat Guru which can keep you abreast of unexpected charges, requirements or rules when flying with a baby or child. 

Some airlines such as easyjet and Aer Lingus give free priority boarding with an infant under two, some let you carry on pushchairs and car seats free of charge.

Find out which. Seatguru is especially good for detailed information about amenities such as bassinets, whether you have to reserve a separate seat for your baby and what type of car seats are allowed on board.

4.) Sit at the back

If you can’t sit near the engine, sit at the back of the plane. As Sara Esther Crispe, co-director of Interinclusion.org and mother-of-four writes on The Jewish Woman, you'll be closer to the bathrooms, less likely to bother other passengers and possibly have more help from flight attendants. You're going to have to wait for the push chair or stroller when you get off the plane anyway.

Careful planning: Follow these tips and you might just make it to your destination without falling to pieces

5.) Get a travel jacket

Imagine Bear Grylls circumnavigating  Borneo's rainforest in Southeast Asia. That's the jacket you need to buy. According to The Art of Manliness, you’ll need all sorts of accouterments - from sweets to pens and paper and tissues -  to placate the small ones and a purpose built travel jacket, with its many, many pockets, means you can easily access them at any time. 

Plus, it doubles as a blanket if they get cold. Just ensure it’s lightweight so you can fold it up and stow it in your luggage when not needed.

Be prepared: Buy an unattractive but practical jacket which has room for supplies and doubles up as a blanket

6.) Book the shortest route

While this isn’t rocket science, if you have a multi-leg trip involving train changes or more than one flight it’s key to plan with military precision. Sites like kayak.com can sort results into travel time so you can choose the faster route. 

Equally, if you do have to have a stopover, leave at least an hour for children to stretch their legs, attack each other and have something to eat.

7.) Pack one of everything

It will save countless arguments. Give each child their own version of everything that’s practical too. This is especially important with crayons, according to Sara Esther Crispe. If they have their own pack they won’t fight over the best colours and you’ll have a better journey. 

Take one spare change of clothes for everyone and at least one plastic bag per person, which you will use for everything from rubbish and cleaning up disasters to emergency bags and keeping things dry after spillages.
