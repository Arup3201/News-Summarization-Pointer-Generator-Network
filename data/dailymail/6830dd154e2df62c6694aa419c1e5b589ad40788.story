Mauritius and the Seychelles have a reputation for being as pricey as they are glorious.

But a winter escape to the Indian Ocean does not have to be expensive.

Rob Crossan picks out a few low-cost deals.

A blissful place in the sun: You can stay cheaply on Mahe - and then pop to the Constance Ephelia resort

SEYCHELLES 

Hanneman Residence, Mahe Island

Three minutes' walk from the beach bars along Beau Vallon beach, on the north-west coast of the main Seychelles island of Mahe, the Hanneman is a white-washed retreat of self-catering apartments.

Situated on a steep hillside, the balconies have great beach views. And you can barbecue a snapper or local 'captain' or 'job' fish you might have caught on a deep-sea fishing trip.

What else? Visit the Constance Ephelia (www.epheliaresort.constance­hotels.com) resort for the day and ride its eight forest zip lines.

Details: Seven nights cost from £295 per person, based on two sharing (00248 4425000, www.hannemanseychelles.com).

Villas de Mer, Praslin Island

The majority of visitors to tiny Praslin (accessible by an hour-long ferry ride from Mahe) hail from France, giving this sleepy island of pristine forests, secluded coves and clear, spearmint-coloured waters a Gallic-Creole feel.

The Villas de Mer's traditional white clapboard main building houses two rooms with ten other bungalow-style chalets arranged around a garden filled with hibiscus flowers. It's a few moments' walk from Grand Anse, a shaded, quiet beach.

What else? Take a hike around the Vallee de Mai forest - the only place in the world where the bizarre-looking coco de mer trees grow.

Details: Seven nights from £556 per person, based on two sharing (0049 521 4481 8616, www.seyvillas.com).

Between a rock and a soft place: La Digue is home to astonishing rock formations

Cabanes des Anges, La Digue Island

La Digue (reachable by a ten-minute ferry ride from Praslin) has a grand total of four taxis. Locals use bicycles, and even the odd ox-drawn cart.

Look out for vanilla plantations, lush vegetation and low-priced restaurants. Cabanes des Anges is the newest guesthouse on the island. It has 15 rooms (nine standard, six self-catering apartments) arranged around a central garden filled with frangipani flowers and gazebos.

What else? Get close to giant Aldabra tortoises that roam the L'Union estate.

Details: Rooms from £313 per person for seven nights (two sharing) (01707 371000, www.justseychelles.com/cabanes-des-anges).

Clef des Iles, Mahe Island

This little charmer of just four two-floor flats overlooking the sands is an absolute steal if little ones are in tow, with under-15s able to stay for just £22 a night.

Scamper straight from the front door on to the beach. Free snorkels, beach chairs and barbecues are available on request.

There's a dive centre next door (www.blueseadivers.com).

What else? Visit the thatched roof Kreol Fleurage perfumery (www.kreolfleurage.com), where fragrances are made from local frangipani, vanilla and cinnamon oils.

Details: Seven nights from £723 per person, based on two sharing (info@clefdesiles.com).

Anse Soleil Beachcomber, Mahe Island

Set among rocks behind the blue waters of a picturesque cove, this bijou guesthouse offers superb views as you sprawl out on its private terraces.

There's a collection of board games to choose from during the late afternoon rain.

What else? Check out the gallery of celebrated local artist Michael Adams, known for his multi-coloured paintings of tropical island life and nature.

Details: Seven nights from £256 per person, based on two sharing (00248 361 461, www.beachcomber.sc).

A place to soothe away your winter sorrows: Mauritius offers many long stretches of sand

MAURITIUS

La Maison D'Ete

On the north-east coast of the island, away from the main patch of resort hotels, La Maison D'Ete is a melange of villas and studios set in front of a reef protected beach, meaning the waters are almost always calm and perfect for a languorous dip.

The rooms have private terraces and there's a cluster of volcanic coves and a lagoon all within easy walking distance along the beach.

Mauritian delicacies in the restaurant include octopus with palm hearts and passion fruit dressing.

What else? Take a day trip to the traditional village of Trou d'Eau Douce.

Details: Rooms from £399 per person for seven nights, based on two sharing (00230 410 5039, www.lamaisondete.com).

Le Palmiste

The knock-down price of this simple hotel on the north-western coast of Mauritius, set in the middle of a tropical garden, is partly because you have to cross the road to get to the beach.

The buttery white sands of the Trou aux Biches are the mainland's finest; sheltered, never too crowded and ten minutes from the cafes and restaurants in Grand Bale.

Rooms are simple, but a steal.

What else? Meander at dusk through the ruined French colonial-era flour mill near Balaclava; covered in vegetation and surrounded by streams.

Details: Rooms from £396 per person for seven nights, based on two sharing (00230 265 6815, www.hotel­lepalmiste.mu).

Sunshine and sparkle: Mauritius is also a haven for those who want to windsurf, dive or snorkel

Laguna Beach Hotel

A turquoise lagoon poses in front of this small spa hotel on the eastern side of the island, with the verdant heights of the Grand Port mountain range looming as the backdrop.

The in-house spa specialises in Shiatsu and Ayurvedic massage treatments. Head to nearby Chez Tino, instead of the slightly drab in-house restaurant. Here there's cheap local dishes galore.

What else? Take the ferry to the tiny island of Ile aux Cerfs, where you can hire pedalos, water skis and dinghies.

Details: Rooms from £342 per person for seven nights based on two sharing (00230 417 5888, www.lagunabeachhotel.mu).

La Hacienda

Next to the Femey Valley Nature Reserve, home to pink pigeons, fruit bats and the native white-tailed tropic bird, La Hacienda comprises four stand-alone villas, surrounded by private gardens with ocean views.

Kick back with a Phoenix beer and gaze to out to where Napoleon won his solitary naval victory against the British in 1810. The villas have wrap-around wooden balconies, stone-flagged floors and are the ideal starting point for a bike ride up nearby Lion Mountain.

What else? Ask to arrange a trip to the nearby lagoon with local fishermen.

Details: Rooms from £532 per person for seven nights, based on two sharing (00230 263 0914, www.lahaciendamauritius.com).

Auberge Aquarella

Owners Gino and Vero keep things simple at this whitewashed collection of bungalows with an infinity pool that seems to stretch out into the turquoise lagoon of Vieux Grant Port.

Rooms are clean but basic - and cheap. While away your afternoons strolling the nearby town of Mahebourg, with its spicy Creole street food and fading, colonial-era mansions.

What else? Visit the 144-year-old Rault biscuit factory.

Details: From £136 per person for seven nights, based on two sharing (00230 631 2767, www.aubergeaquarella-com3.webs.com).

Emirates (www.emirates.com) flies to Seychelles and Mauritus from London via Dubai. Return flights to the Seychelles from £955. Return flights to Mauritus from £927.
