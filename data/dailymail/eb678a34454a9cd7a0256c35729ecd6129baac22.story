A U.S. businessman who went into a drunken rage on board a transatlantic flight to the UK was arrested after allegedly threatening to stab the pilots with a shard of glass.

‘Petrified’ passengers claimed 32-year-old Tom Bradley was drinking large quantities of wine and beer before raving at passengers and attacking staff.

He was travelling in business class from Phoenix, Arizona, to Heathrow on a British Airways 747, but appeared to explode with rage after being refused more alcohol by flight attendants.

Witnesses claimed that during the almost 10 hour flight he was repeatedly shouting, swearing and stumbling around, while spitting at those who tried to calm him.

He then allegedly assaulted a senior member of the cabin crew by pushing him into the galley and demanding to know why he was not allowed any more alcohol.

31-year-old Lesley Lewis was sat close to Bradley on the long flight.

‘At one stage I could see him holding a broken glass ready to attack the crew and talking to himself,’ she told The Sun.

‘He was saying to people around him “I’ll stab the pilots if they want”. I and other passengers were petrified.’

British Airways today told MailOnline they made sure police were waiting for him at the gate when they landed at terminal five on Saturday.

‘Although the cabin crew tried to pacify the passenger, his behaviour continued to be unacceptable and the flight was met by the police,’ the spokeswoman said.

‘We do not tolerate abusive behaviour towards our staff or customers.’

Last week a holidaymaker narrowly avoided jail after she bit, kicked and punched two flight attendants when she went berserk on a delayed flight.

Charity worker Carol Close became so abusive that her husband, and then passengers sitting nearby, had to be moved for their own safety.

She twice had to be forcibly restrained and put in handcuffs.

The 45-year-old flew into a rage during a Thomson Airways flight from Manchester to the Dominican Republic.

She suffers from anxiety and depression, which had been made worse by a 30-hour delay and then a technical hitch once passengers had boarded.

Eventually, the pilot became so concerned that he issued a mayday call asking to make an emergency landing in Bermuda.
