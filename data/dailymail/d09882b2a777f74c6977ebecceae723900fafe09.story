Blackpool's official website is a sorry sight for Tangerine fans, with only eight players on the club's books ahead of the new Championship season.

With just 24 days to go until their campaign begins at Nottingham Forest, chairman Karl Oyston and manager Jose Riga are locked in a stand-off over transfer targets.

Keeping calm: Chairman Karl Oyston says there's no need to panic

Four of the current squad of eight played less than 20 games in the second tier last season, while Segei Zenjov remains Blackpool's one and only signing this term.

Blackpool also re-signed Tony McMahon, who made 18 appearances later term, after the defender's contract expired in the summer.

Tom Barkhuizen (14 Championship appearances last season), David Perkins (20), Gary MacKenzie (35), Steven Davies (28), Bobby Grant (6), and Charles Dunne (0) are the other players on the books.

They were due to fly out to La Manga on Sunday for a nine-day trip but have called it off through a lack of players, and another pre-season friendly against Penrith is also in doubt.

Midfielder Angel Martinez was set to be offered a contract in June after his deal ran out, but has taken to Twitter to say he hasn't been offered anything from the club yet.
