An anorexic woman who drinks half a bottle of vodka a day should not be force fed even if it means she could die within weeks, a judge has ruled.

The woman, who experienced childhood trauma and abuse, has a Body Mass Index (BMI) hovering between 12.3 and 12.6, but believes she is morbidly obese.

A healthy BMI range is between 18.5 and 24.9.

The anorexic woman, who has a BMI of between 12.3 and 12.6, will no longer be forced to have treatment

In a hearing at the Court of Protection in London, Mr Justice Cobb ruled that it was not in her best interests be forced to have treatment or food because of the 'phenomenal' suicide risk.

This is thought to be the first time the courts have ruled that doctors should not give life-sustaining treatment on the grounds that it could hasten death.

The woman, identified only as Miss X, strongly opposes forcible nutrition and hydration even though she knows her life is in imminent danger, the court heard.

She is dependent on alcohol and suffers from liver disease, drinking up to half a bottle of vodka a day, according to The Times.

Doctors who treated her and independent experts were unanimously of the view that it was no longer in her best interests to force treatment.

They said, given the risks posed and discomfort she would suffer, they thought it was no longer right to provide nutrition and treatment against her wishes.

An NHS trust asked Mr Justice Cobb for a declaration saying it was lawful not to make her undergo further compulsory feeding.

Michael Mylonas, QC for the trust, said he believed she was 'terminally ill' and might die at any time.

She refused to engage in any therapy or discussions – even with friends – about the childhood trauma and abuse that underlay her anorexia.

The woman's friend  said she 'could not cope' with more treatment and had added: 'In all honesty, I think she would kill herself.'

Mr Justice Cobb stressed that he was not authorising the withdrawal of treatment. He said treatment remained on offer and said he hoped that the woman would accept treatment.

'This is about the right not to compel treatment,' he said. 'This is an unusual and desperately sad case.' 

He described her as being in a 'revolving door' of treatment and ill-health.

'As it is, her life expectancy is in months,' he said. 

Conrad Hallin, for the official solicitor, said: 'The tragedy of this case is that there is the possibility, even now, that X could live, and live a happy life. But the possibility is very small indeed. 

'There is less than a five per cent chance of something very precious, which is a full recovery and a long life.'

The judge ruled that the woman could not be named and details of her age, where she lived and where she had been treated - could not be reported for fear of identifying her.

She had been detained and force fed under mental health legislation.
