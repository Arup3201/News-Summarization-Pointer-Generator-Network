Embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford attempted to visit a convicted violent offender with an alleged history of drug activity in jail after visiting hours, a new report claims.

The accused, Bruno Belissimo, is described as a childhood friend of Mr Ford. The strange visitation request - which was denied - associates the major of Canada's largest city with yet another shady character from Toronto's underworld.

In another bizarre development, a video surfaced Saturday that many observers say showed Mr Ford staggering drunkenly around a Toronto neighborhood declaring, 'I' not driving, I'm not driving,' after attending a street festival.

Cast of characters: The new revelation add to the less-than-stellar associations of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford. He is seen here with three suspected members of a Toronto street gang

These are just the latest allegations against Mr Ford. In May, a suspected drug dealer approached two media outlets with a video that claimed to show Ford smoking crack cocaine.

Mr Ford denies the existence of such a video.

Mr Ford was also pictured with three alleged members of the Dixon City Bloods, a Toronto street gang, in front of the home of two other childhood friends, Fabio and Elana Basso.

A spokesperson for the mayor did not immediately return a phone call from MailOnline seeking comment

The Toronto Globe and Mail has introduced a new character to the motley cast surrounding Mr Ford - Belissimo.

Sources told the newspaper that in March, Mr Ford showed up unannounced at the Toronto West Detention Centre at 7pm and asked for a tour.

Mr Ford was elected in 2010. He has been under fire for much of that time for various scandals, including allegation that he was caught on video smoking crack cocaine

When jail officials declined his request, he then asked if he could visit Belissimo.

Mr Ford was reportedly told that visiting time ended three hours before he showed up and that he would not be allowed to see Belissimo.

At the time, Belissimo was in jail on charges of assaulting and threatening his parents. He was later convicted and released on probation.

Police sources told the Globe and Mail he also had a history of 'drug activity.'

Belissimo's mother told the newspaper that Belissimo is a childhood friend of Mr Ford and that the two used to go swimming together.

On Saturday, a video surfaced that appeared to show the mayor stumbling drunkenly through a neighborhood after attending a Greek street festival.

'I'm not driving,' the red-faced mayor could b repeatedly heard saying.

Mala Turay, who posted the video, told CBC News that the mayor also asked several times 'where's the party?'

'He's the mayor. He should be setting a better example if he's representing our city like that,' Turay said.

When stopped by a CBC reporter as he was buying snacks at a gas station at 1am Saturday, the mayor dismissed the video and allegation that he was intoxicated.

'I'm big news. I'm a big guy. I guess anything happens with me is big, right?' he said.
