Charged: Paul Hewitt, pictured leaving Exeter Magistrates' Court today, is one of seven managers and 15 other care home staff accused of ill-treating residents

Twenty two members of staff at three care homes have appeared in court accused of abusing vulnerable residents and keeping them prisoner.

Seven senior managers and 15 workers face a total of 86 charges - 11 counts of ill-treating patients and 75 counts of false imprisonment.

The offences are alleged to have taken place at the Veilstone, Gatooma and Teignmead homes in Devon, run by Atlas Project Ltd.

All the homes were shut down in 2012 and the residents moved elsewhere. 

The charges say seven victims were 'unlawfully and injuriously imprisoned' and detained against their will on 68 separate occasions.

Three victims are said to have been ill-treated by staff on five occasions while being treated 'for mental disorder as an in-patient'.

Exeter Magistrates' Court heard the alleged abuse occurred at the care homes, in north and south Devon, between December 31 2009 and January 1 2012.

All three homes, which cared for adults with learning disabilities, were closed in 2012 following inspections by the Care Quality Commission.

Two more workers have been summonsed to appear at the court next week to answer eight charges of false imprisonment and one of ill-treating a patient.

District Judge Stephen Nicholls committed the case to Exeter Crown Court where the defendants will next appear on November 21.

Speaking after the hearing, Detective Inspector Steve White, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said: 'This case is unique in terms of the number of suspects, the complex needs of the victims and the volume of investigation material.

'It has and continues to involve many partners and agencies and we will continue to work together to support those affected as the judicial process continues.'

The defendants are all former employees and worked at Gatooma, in Holsworthy, Teignmead, in Teignbridge, and Veilstone, near Bideford.

It is alleged that the seven, who were all released on conditional bail, conspired together to commit the offences between 2009 and 2012.

Fifteen members of staff appeared before the same court to answer summonses for offences of false imprisonment. Four of them also face a charge of ill-treating a patient.
