A Las Vegas mansion once owned by flamboyant pianist Liberace has been sold for $500,000 to a British businessman.

Martyn Ravenhill bought the 15,000-square-foot property for about $3million less than it was sold for seven years ago.

The mansion, which was 
built in 1962,  has two bedrooms, 10 bathrooms and sits on a half-acre piece of land near 
the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

Inside the bedroom: This image from 1987 shows many features that are reminiscent of the flamboyant star

Ornate: This photograph from 1987 gives a rare look into the bedroom of the Las Vegas home of Liberace

It features several touches 
reminiscent of diamanté-loving Liberace, including chandeliers, a mirror bar etched with
 his signature, and a room with tile piano keys in the floor.

Speaking to Get Surrey, Mr Ravenhill, who learned to play the piano after being inspired by the flamboyant performer, said: 'I grew up thinking Liberace was wonderful. I thought he was much more than just a camp figure. He set trends that continue today.

'Opening the door felt like home. There was a strange feeling of nostalgia to me. You could feel the history in the place as well.'

Real estate agent Brad Wolfe, who represented Mr Ravenhill in the 
deal, said surrounding homes are small and 
sell for $80,000 to $150,000, which dragged down the value of the home.

Expressive: Liberace bought the home in 1974, according to property records. His foundation later sold it to a couple - Vance and Jan Turner - in 1989, two years after the performer died of an AIDS-related illness

Prized property: In 2006, during the heady days of southern Nevada real estate before the housing bubble burst, the couple who bought the house from Liberace sold it to Terrance Lee Dzvonick for $3.7m

Unique: The house features touches reminiscent of Liberace, including chandeliers, a mirror bar etched with his signature, and a room with tile piano keys in the floor

Decline: Real estate agent Brad Wolfe, who represented Mr Ravenhill in the latest deal, said surrounding homes are small and sell for $80,000 to $150,000, which dragged down the value of the home

The property does, however, need some
 work. It does not have a working kitchen and is in a state of 
'functional obsolescence,' said Wolfe.

Liberace,
 whose extravagances were legendary, became the best-paid entertainer on
 the planet during his heyday from the 1950s to the 1970s.

His career was revisited in the recent HBO film Behind the Candelabra, which details his secret romance with the much-younger Scott Thorson.

Liberace bought the home in 1974, according to property records. His foundation later sold it to a married couple - Vance and Jan Turner - in 1989, two years after the performer died of an AIDS-related illness.

In 2006, during the heady days of southern Nevada real estate before the housing bubble burst, the couple sold the home to Terrance Lee 'Dez' Dzvonick for $3.7million.

Stars: Michael Douglas as Liberace, left, and Matt Damon as Scott Thorson are seen in the film Behind the Candelabra which was released this year

JPMorgan Chase seized the property through foreclosure in February 2010, and Dzvonick sued to get it back, saying the bank had wrongfully foreclosed.

The legal tug-of-war ended in December, when U.S. District Judge Gloria Navarro dismissed the case.

When the home went on the market earlier this summer and garnered media attention, the listing agency was getting 100 calls a day from curiosity seekers and possible buyers the world over.
