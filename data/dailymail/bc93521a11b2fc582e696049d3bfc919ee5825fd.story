Partly blaming unrest in the Middle East on President Barack Obama, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Saturday that Obama has not spoken firmly and forcefully on Israel's behalf and that the country no longer trusts it has the full support of the United States because of him.

The Republican governor's remarks came as Israel targeted civilian institutions with suspected ties to the militant organization Hamas and declared it would step up its bombardment of northern Gaza.

Israel says it is acting in self-defense against Hamas rockets.

Christie cited the violence sparked by the deaths of three Israeli teenagers and said organizations like Hamas that are engaged in such conflict with Israel 'need to be dealt with, and dealt with firmly.'

Obama has not done so during his presidency, Christie told reporters while attending a meeting of the National Governors Association.

'Israel is not sure that they have America's full support like they used to,' Christie said. 'And that's a real failure of this presidency, in my view. And I think the unrest you see in the Middle East is caused in some measure - not completely, but in some measure - by the fact that this president has not acted in a decisive, consistent way.'

Christie, who leads the Republican Governors Association, is openly considering a 2016 presidential bid.

While he has limited foreign policy experience, the two-term governor has been speaking more aggressively on international affairs in recent months.

Christie said Obama should be focused on trying to bring stability to the region 'by having America be a forceful voice in favor of a democracy like Israel, and be condemning in the strongest terms and with actions the things that are being done by Hamas against Israel.'

When asked, Christie declined to say whether Obama should take military action if necessary.

When Obama spoke earlier this week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the White House said the president condemned the rocket attacks and said Israel has the right to defend itself.

He also urged both sides not to escalate the crisis and offered to have the U.S. negotiate a cease-fire, the White House said in a statement.

Israel widened its range of Gaza bombing targets to civilian institutions with suspected Hamas ties and deployed ground troops inside Gaza for the first time early Sunday to raid a rocket launching site in the Palestinian territory. More than 156 Palestinians have been killed in five days of bombardment.

Four Israeli soldiers were hurt in clashes during the brief incursion to destroy a rocket launching site in northern Gaza, the military said. It said they have returned to Israeli territory.

It was the first time that Israeli ground troops are known to have entered Gaza in the current offensive. But the operation was carried out by special forces and did not appear to be the beginning of a broad ground offensive.

On Saturday, Israel announced it would hit northern Gaza 'with great force' to prevent rocket attacks from there on Israel.

One of the Israeli strikes hit a center for the disabled where Palestinians said two patients were killed and four people seriously hurt. In a second attack, on Saturday evening, an Israeli warplane flattened the home of Gaza's police chief and damaged a nearby mosque as evening prayers ended, killing at least 18 people, officials said.

In New York, the U.N. Security Council called unanimously for a cease-fire, while Britain's foreign minister said he will discuss cease-fire efforts with his American, French and German counterparts on Sunday.

So far, neither Israel nor Gaza's Hamas rulers have signaled willingness to stop.

Israel has carried out more than 1,200 air strikes this week to try to diminish Hamas' ability to fire rockets at Israel, and the chief military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Motti Almoz, said Saturday there would be more strikes, especially in northern Gaza near the Israeli border.

'We are going to attack there with great force in the next 24 hours due to a very large concentration of Hamas efforts in that area,' he said. Late Saturday, the military said it was ordering Palestinians in northern Gaza to evacuate 'for their own safety.'
