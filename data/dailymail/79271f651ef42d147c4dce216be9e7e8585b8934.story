A theater in Salt Lake City, Utah, has won praise for its response to a letter from a mother who complained about a kissing scene between two male characters.

The unnamed woman, who visited the Pioneer Theatre Company with her teenage son, called a performance of the 1978 play Deathtrap ‘offensive and vulgar’ and its kiss scene an ‘explicit, homosexual display’.

But an eloquent response from the theater questions why she is more upset by the characters’ display of affection than their on-stage killing sprees.

Speaking out: Chris Lino, the managing director of the Pioneer Theatre Company (left, next to artistic director Karen Azenberg) has written a letter in response to an angry patron

Chris Lino, the Pioneer Theatre 
Company’s managing director, wrote: ‘You object to the kissing, but not 
to the fact that they’re murderers? You are comfortable with your son 
witnessing an enacted murder, but not a same-sex kiss? In both cases, 
it’s just make-believe, but how is a play that depicts murder, whether 
it’s a contemporary murder-mystery like Deathtrap or an immortal tragedy
 like Macbeth, morally acceptable while the depiction of a fairly 
innocuous, albeit same-sex kiss, is totally unacceptable?’

He offered to refund the woman for her tickets and said that he would place a ‘do not contact’ tag on her records.

Mr Lino, who posted both the woman’s letter and his response to the company’s Facebook page, has been applauded for his words.

His
 response was hailed as ‘perfect’ by commenters and ‘beautifully 
handled’, while others pointed out that the woman could have easily 
researched the plot synopsis prior to attending with her son.

Posting to Facebook: Mr Lino posted the complaint to the Pioneer Theatre Company's Facebook along with his response

The
 woman’s initial letter took issue with the fact that the Pioneer 
Theatre Company did not flag Deathtrap as a play containing sexual 
scenes.

‘I have NEVER been 
so disgusted and infuriated!,’ she wrote. ‘I was livid. . . I had read 
and reread the content advisory to make sure it would be suitable to 
have my teenage son attend. I anticipated that he would appreciate the 
suspense, intrigue, plot twists, and mystery. The decision on the 
theatre’s part not to divulge repulsive content was irresponsible and 
negligent! You have that responsibility to your patrons.

She is not alone in these opinions.

Brian
 Urie, a media watchdog in Salt Lake City, told Fox 13 news in their 
coverage of the controversy: ‘Somewhere I’d like some standardization 
before taking my kids to live theater.’
