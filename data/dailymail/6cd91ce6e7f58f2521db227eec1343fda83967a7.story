Napoli coach Rafael Benitez has ruled out making an attempt to bring Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina back to the club.

The Spain international, who has two years left on his contract with the Reds, spent last season on loan at Napoli.

Reina, 31, said last week he was open to the possibility of playing for Napoli again, but the Italians already have three shot-stoppers in their books for next season.

Uncertain future: Pepe Reina will return to Liverpool after spending last season on loan at Napoli

'We don't seek a goalkeeper,' Benitez said on his official website, www.rafabenitez.com.

'Rafael, with whom I keep in touch often to monitor his progress first hand, (Mariano) Andujar and (Roberto) Colombo are a sufficient guarantee for our goal.'

Rafael is expected to start for Napoli next season. The Brazilian sustained a serious right knee injury in February but will be fit for the start of the season.

Argentinian goalkeeper Andujar has returned to Napoli this month after spending last season on loan at Catania.

Napoli also have veteran goalkeeper Colombo in their books. Reina is currently with the Spain team at the World Cup.
