Right to bear arms: Republican Mike Leara is calling for new legislation which would make anyone who suggested tightening gun laws guilty of felony

An American politician is calling for new legislation which would make anyone who suggested tightening gun laws guilty of felony.

Mike Leara, a Republican for St Louis County in Missouri, supports a bill that would make it a class D felony if any member of the state’s General Assembly tries to introduce legislation ‘that further restricts an individual’s right to bear arms’.

The controversial move comes as new legislation, tightening gun control, was introduced in the wake of the Newtown shooting in Connecticut that left 28 people dead including 20 small children.

His bill, presented on Sunday, read: 
‘Any member of the general assembly who proposes a piece of legislation 
that further restricts the right of an individual to bear arms, as set 
forth under the second amendment of the Constitution of the United 
States, shall be guilty of a class D felony.’

Mr Leara said he does not expect his bill to pass but wanted to make a point about freedom.

According to TPM he
said: ‘I have no illusions about the bill making it through the 
legislative process, but I want it to be clear that the Missouri House 
will stand in defence of the people’s Constitutional right to keep and 
bear arms.’

In response to Mr Leara’s bill, Democrat for St Louis Stacey Newman commented on Twitter.

In response: Democrat for St Louis Stacey Newman, who recently introduced HB 187 which 'requires that all sales or transfers of firearms be processed through a licensed firearms dealer' put her opinion about Mr Leara's bill known on Twitter

She had recently introduced HB 187 
which ‘requires that all sales or transfers of firearms be processed 
through a licensed firearms dealer’.

She
posted on Twitter: ‘Sends me straight to prison re my HB187. 
@jshormanNL: Leara bill to criminalize proposing gun control 
legislation.

‘My legal defense team gearing up. I committed a felony by filing MO Universal background checks bill.’

'Buy a shotgun': Vice President Joe Biden made the comment for Americans who want to protect themselves

The issue continues to divide 
America. Today, Vice President Joe Biden urged Americans who want to 
protect themselves to 'buy a shotgun.'

The 70-year-old, who led the national task-force on gun control after the Newtown school shooting, made the remark during a Tuesday Facebook town hall event with Parents Magazine.

In Congress it was revealed that an assault weapons ban would protect more than 2,200 firearms, including a semi-automatic rifle nearly identical to one used in the bloodiest shootout in FBI history. 

One model of that firearm, the Ruger .223 caliber Mini-14, is on the proposed banned list, while a different model of the same gun is on a list of exempted firearms in legislation the Senate is considering. 

The gun that would be protected from the ban has fixed physical features and can't be folded to be more compact. Yet the two firearms are equally deadly.

A bill introduced last month by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. would ban 157 specific firearms designed for military and law enforcement use and exempt others made for hunting purposes.

It also would ban ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.
