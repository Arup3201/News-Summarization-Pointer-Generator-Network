It was once China's longest lake bridge, stretching for nearly two miles across the surface of Poyang Lake and providing a crucial transport link for those who lived there.

As the lake level rose it disappeared into a watery grave, buried under the surface for almost 400 years, but now a prolonged drought means it emerges during the dry season.

For the last two years visitors have travelled to see the Ming Dynasty creation as it appears among the mud in the Poyang basin, in Jiangxi province, south east China.

Muddy waters: The bridge, which stretches for almost two miles and used to be China's longest lake bridge, was buried at the bottom of Poyang Lake as water levels rose

Antique: The granite construction was concealed beneath the waves for almost 400 years but for the last two years it has surfaced as a prolonged drought in the region causes the lake to dry up

Made from granite, measuring more than 2,500ft, and dating to 1631, the structure was known as 'thousand eye bridge' because it had 1,100 holes dotted along its length.

Built during the reign of the last Ming emperor, it served as a key link between the large towns and small fishing villages that surrounded the water.

The Poyang lake serves as an important part of Ming history, as that is where the first Ming emperor won victory over the Han clan in 1363, effectively beginning the dynasty.

This granite bridge was one of around 1,000 such bridges built across the one lake during the end of the Ming reign.

Poyang Lake is China's largest freshwater lake, and at is annual peak usually covers an area twice the size of London.

Relic: The walkway was known as 'thousand eye bridge' because it used to have 1,100 holes along its length, and was completed during the rule of the last Ming emperor

Dried up: The level of Poyang Lake varies hugely depending on the season, but for the last several years it has struggled to fill itself during winter, and has all but disappeared during the dry season 

Fed by the Yangtze River its size varies wildly depending on the season, but in recent years it has been struggling to fill itself during winter, and all but disappearing in summer.

Water levels currently sit at 32ft (10m) and have fallen to the same level each year since 2012.

Chinese authorities point to a prolonged dry spell that has affected the region, but locals also point to the creation of the massive Three Gorges Dam further up the river.

The dam stores water in the winter to help keep the turbines running during the dry season, and observers are concerned this is depriving the lake of the water it needs to survive.

Damaged: Chinese authorities have blamed the dried up lake on a prolonged drought, but locals point to the creation of the Three Gorges Dam along the Yangtze River, which feeds the lake, as the cause

Disappearing: During the dry season the lake level has dropped below ten metres (32ft) at its lowest point, devastating the local fishing industry (pictured, the lake at its peak)

Whatever the cause, the impact on the locals has been devastating. The fishing industry has been ruined as dead fish are left washed up on the lake's banks as the waters recede.

Poyang is also a major breeding site for migratory birds who arrive in the summer and rely on the lake for food while they mate.

Last year authorities were forced to air-drop shrimp, maize, and small fish on to the dry lake bed in order to feed the birds.

However it sank underwater for almost 400 years after lake level rose

Now drought means that granite slabs reappear during the dry season
