The contrast between this video and earlier Islamic State propaganda could hardly be greater.

Until John Cantlie’s appearance yesterday, the IS videos had shown a series of horrific beheadings.

These included the last moments of UK aid worker David Haines and US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. Each video ended with a chilling picture of the next hostage facing death.

The victims were wearing orange jumpsuits, kneeling in the sand, with blue sky behind them. The knife-wielding figure of the British fanatic known as Jihadi John was seen next to them as he ranted about Barack Obama and David Cameron.

Yesterday’s video has no knives, no threats and no beheading. It was equally slick in production but a total contrast in style, almost like a parody of a US TV chat show – though still burdened with menace.

Reference from A Beatles song? 

Titles at the opening of the video declare ‘Lend Me Your Ears – message from British detainee John Cantlie.’

The choice of the phrase ‘Lend Me Your Ears’ could be significant one. It was used in the Beatles song With A Little Help From My Friends and could be seen as a twisted reference to the fact that the British captors responsible for the beheadings are said to be known as The Beatles.

If so, it could be an attempt to poke fun at the Western media and a signal that they are aware of, even enjoying, their own infamy.

There is a further interpretation, however. The phrase was coined by Shakespeare in Julius Caesar, where it opens a speech by Mark Anthony – a man who has been forced to speak words he does not believe in – but ultimately manages to convert a crowd to what he truly thinks.

The scenario could be compared to that of Cantlie, who is being forced – in his words, with ‘a gun to his head’ – to speak words he presumably does not really believe.

No clues in 'TV studio' setting

Cantlie is shown in the opening shot sitting indoors at a polished wooden table, his hands folded in front of him.

Unlike the previous videos where the ground and background have provided analysts with clues as to where it is, the images have been stripped of anything that could provide help to those wishing to find the hostages.

For a man facing execution, the Briton appears remarkably calm, his words clearly spoken.

Introducing ‘the detainee’

Cantlie is not wearing the distinctive orange jumpsuits seen on his fellow captives – in a mocking imitation of those the Americans made terror suspects wear in Guantanamo Bay.

Instead he is shown in a loose-fitting, round-neck orange top with elbow length sleeves.

Significantly, the word ‘Detainee’ is used on screen in English and then Arabic to describe the photographer.

He is markedly thinner than when last pictured shortly after crossing the border back in the Syria from Turkey in November 2012.

His hair has been cropped short and he has a relatively well-kept beard and moustache. His hands show no scars and his fingernails appear cut and clean. There are no signs of the beatings many of the hostages have endured.

Deliberate? The line Lend Me Your Ears was used in a Beatles song  and could be seen as a twisted reference to the fact that the British captors responsible for the beheadings are said to be known as The Beatles

Was he using an autocue?

Throughout the slick 3.21 minute video, posted on YouTube, the Briton appears to be reading from an autocue. The speech was almost certainly written for him.

While he often uses his hands like a TV reporter to emphasise a point – once putting his fingers to his head mimicking a gun – his eyes rarely wander from the screen in front of him. It is a method IS had used successfully on the previous videos, especially when Mr Haines, 44, read a script fiercely criticising Mr Cameron shortly before the former RAF engineer was killed.

Sometimes, the camera zooms in close to Cantlie’s face, before pulling back to a wider, rounded frame. It seems at least two cameras are used – indicating a level of sophistication in the production.

Hello, My name is John Cantlie

Speaking calmly and clearly, he begins : ‘Hello, my name is John Cantlie. I’m a British journalist who used to work for some of the bigger newspapers and magazines in the UK, including the Sunday Times, The Sun, and The Sunday Telegraph.

‘In November 2012 I came to Syria, where I was subsequently captured by the Islamic State. Now, nearly two years later, many things have changed, including the expansion of the Islamic State to include large areas of Eastern Syria and Western Iraq – a land mass bigger than Britain, and many other nations.’

Government’s abandoned me

Unclasping his hands he continues: ‘Now, I know what you’re thinking. You’re thinking: “he’s only doing this because he’s a prisoner he’s got a gun at his head and he’s being forced to do this,” right? Well, it’s true.

‘I am a prisoner, that I cannot deny. But seeing as I’ve been abandoned by my government and my fate now lies in the hand of the Islamic State I have nothing to lose. Maybe I will live and maybe I will die, but I want to take this opportunity to convey some facts that you can verify, facts that if you contemplate might help in preserving lives.’

I’ll be back with more messages

Cantlie’s voice remains clear and a constant tone as he unveils the video is the first of several planned by IS.

He said : ‘Over the next few programmes I’m going to show you the truth as the Western media tries to drag the public back to the abyss of another war with the Islamic State.

After two disastrous and hugely unpopular wars in Afghanistan and Iraq why is it that our governments appear so keen to get involved in yet another unwinnable conflict?’

More messages: Although Mr Cantlie does not refer to it directly, he suggests he will reveal the ‘truth’ about why the British and American hostages were murdered

You think you’re told the truth?

As Cantlie winds-up his speech, he stresses : ‘I’m going to show you the truth behind the systems and motivation of the Islamic State, and how the Western media – the very organisation I used to work – for can twist and manipulate that truth for the public back home. There are two sides to every story. Think you’re getting the whole picture?’

And although he does not refer to it directly, he suggests he will reveal the ‘truth’ about why the British and American hostages were murdered – suggesting it is the fault of British and American governments for not paying ransoms.

‘And I’ll show you the truth behind what happened when many European citizens were imprisoned and later released by the Islamic State, and how the British and American governments thought they could do it differently to every other European country,’ he says.

‘They negotiated with the Islamic State and got their people home, while the British and Americans were left behind.’

A warning to chill the blood

Cantlie’s chilling conclusion was remarked upon for its use of the word ‘head’ which some saw as a veiled reference to the threat of beheading hanging over the other hostages including Alan Henning.

He concludes : ‘It’s very alarming to see where this is all headed and it looks like history repeating itself, yet again.’

But he suggests that the public can ‘change’ the course of events – though it is not clear how.

‘There is time to change this seemingly inevitable sequence of events, but only if you, the public act now,’ he says.

‘Join me for the next few programmes, and I think you may be surprised at what you learn.’ The screen then turns to black.
