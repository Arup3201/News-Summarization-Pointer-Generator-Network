Your next mobile phone or computer could be powered by a glass of wine, chipmaker Intel has revealed.

At the firm’s annual developers conference in San Francisco, it showed a low-powered computer able to draw enough power from a glass of red wine to power itself up.

The project was demonstrated by Dr Genevieve Bell, who said: ‘Some people turn water into wine, here at Intel we're turning wine into electricity.’

The firm hopes the experiment, designed to show off how little power computers and sensors could run on, could lead new a new breed of computers and wearable sensors that constantly monitor our health, for instance, and are powered by the heat from our skin.

‘It's possible to start to imagine a world of incredibly low power but also with high performance, which will help unburden us, help us do things that are remarkable and gives the ability to power things like constant sensing, communication, and computing - all of which are necessary for our mobile future,’ she said.

An Intel researcher carried out the groundbreaking demo.

‘Today, we're not here to talk about watts. We're not even here to talk about milliwatts. We're here to talk about microwatts,’ he said.

‘We're talking computing solutions so low that, in the future, we should be able to power them with the heat of our skin or the ambulant light in the room or, like I show you today, maybe something just a little bit more entertaining.’

The demonstration saw a researcher take a bottle of red wine and pour it into a glass containing two electrodes.

As the current flowed between them, sensors came to life and showed live data feeds on a giant screen.

‘You might remember in grade school, you did a little experiment where you took some lemons and you put a copper penny and a nail in there, and you lit up an LED,’ the researchers said.

‘Well, we're in California, so we're going to do the same thing, only wine is cheaper than lemons here. So we're going to do it today with wine.

‘So I'm going to take my bottle of wine here, and I've got a glass, I've got some copper, and I've got some zinc in there, so I'm going to do really that same experiment we did in high school or in grade school.’

Intel says the technology could see computers in new and inaccessible places.

‘Low power is essential for the future of wearable devices and sensors in smart spaces, where frequent charging or power cables would be burdensome or even impossible,’ said Intel’s Mike Bell.

‘Only then can technology be truly personal and embedded into the places and spaces we inhabit and move through.’

Earlier this week Intel introduced a line of extremely low-power processors called Quark for wearable and embedded devices Another demonstration focused on cyclists, with a smart fabric jacket that lit up when it sensed a cyclist was braking or going quickly to alert drivers nearby.

A prototype being developed by Fraunhofer Institute in Munich, it is made using smart fibers that have sensors, in this case accelerometers, built in.
