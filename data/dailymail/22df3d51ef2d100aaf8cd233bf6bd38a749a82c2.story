A six-year-old transgender child is fighting alongside her parents for the right to be recognized as a girl at school.

Coy Mathis, who was born male but has identified as female since the age of four, was barred from using the girls' restroom at Eagleside Elementary School in Fountain, Colorado in December.

On a special edition of the Katie show, her parents Jeremy and Kathryn Mathis revealed that they are now pursuing legal action over the the school district's decision to force Coy to only use the boys' bathroom, gender-neutral faculty bathrooms or the nurse's bathroom.

Growing pains: Coy Mathis, pictured with her mother Kathryn, was born male but identifies as female - her school recently banned her from using the girl's bathroom but now her parents are fighting the decision

Prior to the complaint, the 
first-grader, who dresses as a girl and is recognized as female on her 
passport and state-issued ID, had experienced no issue using the girls' 
bathrooms.

'She would use the girl's restrooms, 
she would be called a girl, she would go in the girl's lines,' Mrs 
Mathis told host Katie Couric.

But a year after making the transition at school, the 
Fountain-Fort Carson School District informed Coy's parents that she 
would be barred from using the girl's restrooms after the winter break. 

Explaining the chain of events, Mr Mathis said: 'We got a call one evening, it was the principal and
 he said he wanted to set up a meeting with us to discuss options for 
Coy's future use of the restroom.

Uncomfortable: Coy's parents said before she made the transition from boy to girl she refused to go outside and play with her friends because she didn't want to wear boys' clothing

'It came out the Coy was no longer 
going to be able to use the girl's restroom and they were going to 
require her to be using the boy's room or the staff bathroom or the 
bathroom for the sick children.

'We didn't know why... we had no idea where this was coming from.'

After receiving the news, the couple, who have five children under eight, took all of their children out of Eagleside Elementary School and filed a complaint with the state's civil rights division.

'By forcing Coy to use a different 
bathroom than all the other girls, the school is targeting her for 
stigma, bullying and harassment'

Michael Silverman of the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund, who is representing the Mathis family said: 'By forcing Coy to use a different 
bathroom than all the other girls, Coy’s school is targeting her for 
stigma, bullying and harassment.

'Coy's school has the opportunity to turn this around and teach Coy's 
classmates a valuable lesson about friendship, respect and basic 
fairness.'

But W Kelly Dude, the lawyer for Fountain-Fort Carson School District 8, told CNN that the school 'took into account not only Coy but
 other students in the building, their parents, and the future impact a 
boy with male genitals using a girls' bathroom would have as Coy grew 
older...

Early signs: Kathryn and Jeremy Mathis started to realize that their son was drawn towards 'everything girl' when he was just 18-months old

'I'm certain you can appreciate that as Coy grows older and his
 male genitals develop along with the rest of his body, at least some 
parents and students are likely to become uncomfortable with his 
continued use of the girls' restroom,' he added.

The Mathis' case is the first to 
challenge restrictions on a transgender person’s bathroom use under 
Colorado’s anti-discrimination law.

'He wanted to know when we were going to take him to the doctor so that they would give him girl parts'

Mrs Mathis said that Coy was just 18-months-old when she started being drawn towards 'everything girl'.

Some of her favorite items included a fairy flower dress with a matching tutu and a Dora the Explorer bathing suit.

'It was starting to be obvious to us that Coy was really uncomfortable being a boy,' Mrs Mathis recalled.

'He wanted to know when we were going
 to take him to the doctor so that they would give him girl parts so 
that his body would be a girl.' 

It reached breaking-point when Coy refused to leave the house because she didn't want to change into boys' clothes.

Happy family; The Mathis' have five children under the age of eight

Life of a little girl: Coy's bedroom is filled with dolls, stuffed toys and lots of pink

A psychologist confirmed that Coy was 
transgender and when she was four-years old her parents let her 'be who 
she was' and she made the transition from boy to girl.

Today she looks like any other girl her 
age, dressed in cute dresses with her blonde hair styled in a shoulder-length cut.

She describes 
her favorite color as pink and her bedroom is littered with dolls and stuffed toys.

Mrs
 Mathis said the change in Coy after she transitioned 'was just 
amazing... The anxiety went away, the depression went away... all of a 
sudden she wanted to go play at parks.'

Coy will be home-schooled until the issue is resolved.

Mrs Mathis told the Denver Post: 'It's important for us to talk about this, because a lot of people have been so afraid to be their true selves for so long.

'We want to help create a society where it's OK to be who you are.'
