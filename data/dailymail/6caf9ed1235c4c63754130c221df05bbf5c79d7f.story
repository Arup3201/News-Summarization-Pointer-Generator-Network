South Yorkshire Police has been accused of failing to act when a mother in Rotherham found the names of 125 potential sex abusers on her daughter's mobile phone, it has been reported.

It has been alleged that the force told the mother that investigating the names would be a 'breach of her daughter's human rights'.

The claims come from Professor Alexis Jay, the author of a damning report released this week into how 1,400 children in the South Yorkshire town were sexually abused at the hands of Asian men over 16 years, in an interview with the Daily Telegraph.

Alexis Jay, the author of a report, which investigated child abuse in Rotherham and found that at least 1,400 children had been victims

In another case she claims it was also alleged that a CID officer suggested a 12-year-old, who had sex with five men was not a victim of abuse because it was 'consensual'.

The claims come after the report by Professor Jay said the abuse went unreported for 16 years between 1997 and 2013, because staff feared they would be seen as racist.

Yesterday South Yorkshire's chief constable spoke out about the report for the first time yesterday saying the findings made painful reading and vowed to 'fully investigate' the abuses.

He said: 'The report into CSE (child sexual exploitation) in Rotherham laid bare the failings of South Yorkshire Police over a number of years.

'This made for painful reading. However, I am determined that we will use the findings of the report to ensure the mistakes of the past are not repeated,' he added.

It has also been claimed that former South Yorkshire Police chief Mike Hedges, was sent two letter giving a detailed account of abuse Rotherham.

But Mr Hedges told the Times: 'Things were going on of which I was not aware... but I'm certain that the issue was never raised as something of high priority at all.'

Meanwhile a former worker at a children's home in Rotherham has told how paedophiles would brazenly turn up to pick up girls as young as 11 who would escape from the building.

A source, who has not been named, has now told the Daily Mirror how groomed girls in the home where he worked would escape from windows by tying their bed sheets together so they could meet up with the men.

The child sexual exploitation team at Rotherham Council, pictured, won an award in March for tackling child sex exploitation 

He said: 'If they [the girls] could leave by the fire escape, they would leave by the fire escape but sometimes, to hide where they were going, they would put bed sheets together and climb out of a window.

'Sometimes they would phone and they would pick up around the corner, but sometimes they would turn up and pick up at the children's home.

'It depended on how brazen they were or how much heat they thought was on at the time.'

He also added that workers at the home were threatened by the men if they confronted them.

It comes as it was also revealed that Rotherham Council's child sexual exploitation team won an award for tackling child sex exploitation in March, despite being at the centre of an abuse scandal. 

The national award was presented by the charity the NWG Network, who said they team were recognised for undergoing 'the longest journey under challenging conditions'.

However, chief executive of the charity Sheila Taylor defended the decision to award Rotherham the honour and told the Sun it was for work done over the past year by current council staff.

The spotlight first fell on Rotherham in 2010 when five men, described by a judge as 'sexual predators', were given lengthy jail terms after they were found guilty of grooming teenage girls for sex.

Ged Fitzgerald, the former chief executive of Rotherham Council, who is set to be questioned by his current employer Liverpool Council, over what he knew about the town's sex abuse scandal 

The five men - Umar Razaq, Adil Hussain, Razwan Razaq, Zafran Ramzan, and Mohsin Khan - preyed on their victims over several months and threatened them with violence if they refused their advances.

The men, all British-born Pakistanis, attacked the four girls in play areas, parks and in the back of their cars, Sheffield Crown Court heard.

Yesterday it was revealed that the former chief executive of Rotherham Council is to be questioned by his current employer over what he knew about the town's sex abuse scandal.

Ged Fitzgerald, now head of Liverpool council, presided in Rotherham for a two-year period between 1997 and 2013.

And during his tenure from 2001 to 2003, council figures allegedly wiped evidence of sexual abuse cases from computers as the Home Office compiled a report on the town.

Mr Fitzgerald will become the first of the senior councillors in charge during the scandal to face interrogation.

In a statement, Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson said he intended to raise his concerns about the report with Mr Fitzgerald.

Earlier an Australian abuse victims' advocate called on Rotherham's former director of children's services to step down from her current job in that country.

Andrew Collins said Dr Sonia Sharp's role as a deputy secretary in the state of Victoria's education department, which she has held since 2012, was inappropriate. She has been publicly backed by her employer.

Dr Sharp, who worked in Rotherham from 2005 to 2008, apologised to abuse victims yesterday and said staff were aware that 'many' children were at risk. She said she wished she could have done more but insisted she had helped improve things during her tenure.
