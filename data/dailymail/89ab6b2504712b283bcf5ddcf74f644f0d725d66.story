Sir Peter Fahy, national police lead for preventing extremism, said officers who demanded the names of people who bought Charlie Hebdo in the wake of the Paris attacks appeared 'overzealous and unneccessary'

Anti-terror units handed local police officers the names of British newsagents who stocked the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in the wake of the Paris attacks. 

But the decision by some forces to then visit the outlets and quiz shopkeepers about who bought the publication was 'overzealous and unnecessary', Britain's anti-terror police chief has said.

Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester Police (GMP) and national police lead for preventing extremism, said he was now urgently clarifying guidance to all UK forces. 

It comes after police were caught asking British newsagents which sold copies of the satirical magazine for details of the customers who bought it.

Shopkeepers in Wales, Wiltshire and Cheshire reported that police approached them and demanded personal information on readers of the magazine. 

In a letter to the Guardian, Sir Peter said that the move to provide details of newsagents to local police was intended to 'provide community reassurance'. 

But he admitted that officers who then asked for details of individuals who bought the magazine had appeared 'over-zealous and unnecessary'.

He said: 'Following the attacks in Paris, there has been an increase in incidents of antisemitism and Islamaphobia.

'Forces were aware of the potential for heightened tension with the release of Charlie Hebdo and many neighbourhood police officers, who are well known in their communities, may have opted to visit sellers to establish any concerns and provide reassurance. 

'However, it is important that we do not erode the very freedoms that we are trying to protect. I understand why asking for the names of those who might have bought this magazine will appear over-zealous and unnecessary. There was no national guidance to this effect and it is not to be supported unless there is clear evidence that a crime has been committed.'

Wiltshire police have since apologised, while the other forces have denied their officers asked for names. 

The MailOnline revealed yesterday that The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) was handed a list of Charlie Hebdo's UK stockists by John Menzies, one of the magazine's UK distributors, via the National Counter-Terrorism Policing unit. 

ACPO then alerted forces who had shops selling Charlie Hebdo in their area, saying that officers should be aware that the magazine was on sale. 

But while the alert said police may wish to visit the shops involved, they should only do so if there were signs of rising tensions.

Officers visited  a small newsagents and post office in Wiltshire and requested the personal details of all subscribers to the Charlie Hebdo magazine (pictured), which was the subject of a terrorist attack. Now it has emerged that officers in Wales and Cheshire have also approached shopkeepers

The advice said forces should review the lists for retailers using post codes, and if there are raised community tension indicators, or a large number of copies advertised for sale, then they should consider a site visit.

The ACPO advice did not recommend visiting each shop, and did not mention taking down the details of customers who had bought the publication, according to the spokesman.

It would appear that the three forces concerned either misunderstood the advice, or acted on their own impulse when they decided to ask for information on customers. 

Paul Merrett, 57, owner of a newsagent in Presteigne, Wales, said a detective and a police community support officer arrived at his shop and started to question his wife about the people who bought them.

He said: 'They wanted to know where we had got them from, and did we know who we had sold them to.

'[My wife] said she wasn't prepared to give any names. She thought we were in trouble for selling them originally, but they said we weren't, and they just wanted to know who bought them.

'We didn't give them any details. It was all very strange. There were a couple of customers in here at the time, so it soon got around town.'

A Dyfed-Powys police spokesman denied that customer details were asked for. 

She said: 'It was not the intention to gather any personal information of those who purchased the magazine and we can confirm no purchaser details were asked for or recorded. Dyfed Powys Police can confirm the visits were only made to enhance public safety and to provide community reassurance.'

Cheshire police also denied that officers had asked for customers details. 

A spokesman said: 'Officers were asked to call into local newsagents in their area to provide visible reassurance around the time of publication and were not asked under any circumstances to make enquiries as to who was purchasing or preordering the Charlie Hebdo magazine.

'Each area endeavored to visit as many newsagents as possible however we cannot provide an exact figure.' 

Wiltshire officers asked at least three newsagents for people's details.

The force apologised after admitting that an officer had taken down the names of four people in the town of Corsham who bought the magazine featuring a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed on the front.

A spokesman said: 'Wiltshire Police are confident that the police officer’s intention was purely around enhancing public safety and ensuring that the newsagent was advised appropriately.'

The Paris massacre led to an outpouring of support around the world, including the 'Je Suis Charlie' message

Emma Carr, director of Big Brother Watch, said: 'The Charlie Hebdo attack brought millions of people worldwide together to condemn those who seek to silence free speech through threats of intimidation and violence.

'This move by the police is entirely unacceptable. This sort of investigation would be understandable if a crime was being committed, but the fact is that they have requested information about people who have purchased a perfectly legal publication.

'It is far from clear why the police thought it was acceptable to request this information or what it is that they actually intend to do with it. Considering the comments made in the aftermath of the attacks in Paris by world leaders, that free speech should be celebrated and encouraged, the moves by the police in the UK completely undermine that.' 

Hundreds of Britons queued for a copy of the £3.50 souvenir edition of the magazine, published following last month's attack by Islamic extremists on its offices which left 12 people dead.

John Menzies said it had handed over a list of newsagents which had ordered the magazine in the interest of safety and security. 

A spokesman said: 'Given the sensitive nature of this product, Menzies Distribution's priority was the safety and security of our employees and customers.

'Where appropriate we consulted with the relevant authorities to ensure the these priorities were met at all times.' 

Smiths News, another Charlie Hebdo distributor, has also refused to comment. The move has been branded 'entirely unacceptable' by privacy campaigners.
