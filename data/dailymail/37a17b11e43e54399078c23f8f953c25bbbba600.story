Jason Thomas (pictured outside Southwark Crown Court) persuaded Luisa Smith to send him £175,000 by telling her he needed to pay off drug debts, it is alleged

A personal trainer duped a trust fund manager out of £175,000 after saying he loved her - and then used the money to fund an extravagant lifestyle, a court heard today.

Jason Thomas, 42, persuaded Luisa Smith, 35, to send him the cash by telling her he needed to pay off drug debts, it is alleged.

Thomas even convinced his smitten victim he would use some of the money to buy a house with her, Southwark Crown Court was told.

But instead, he used the proceeds to fuel his ‘delusions of grandeur’, splashing out on luxuries including a jet-ski and designer watches.

Smith, a trust fund manager at Capita Trustees in Jersey, ended up plundering two high-profile accounts and remortgaged her flat to get the money for the man she loved.

The cash was then sent back to Thomas via bank accounts belonging to his brother Steven, 43, and former Credit Suisse banker Rory Codd, 34, jurors heard.

Prosecutor Riel Karmy-Jones said of Jason Thomas: ‘He used this woman to fund an extravagant lifestyle.

‘The Crown say Jason Thomas has delusions of grandeur and has an over-inflated feeling of self-worth which his personal training could not satisfy.

‘He targeted a woman in a good job and he told her that he needed her cash because he was in debt to drug dealers or that his own clients had not paid him.

‘And so the woman paid up, wanting to impress the man she loved.’

Smith met Thomas through a friend and immediately fell in love with him when they kissed on a date during 2008.

But within months, he was pleading for money he said would be used to pay off drug debts.

In a ‘test run’ on June 27, 2009, he received £40,000 after Smith remortgaged her flat and paid the money via Codd’s account.

A further payment of £98,000 was then made to Codd from one of the trust accounts Smith was looking after at her work.

Between
May and August 2009, payments of £62,500 and £14,000 were paid to 
Steven Thomas from a trust account Smith was in charge of.

Ms Karmy-Jones said: ‘He said if she loved him she would be happy to give him money and help clear his debts.

‘Jason Thomas enjoyed living an extravagant life though and some of his expenses were well beyond the means a personal trainer’s salary could provide.’

In February 2008, Thomas was looking 
to buy an £85,000 boat which he told the dealer he would be able to pay 
for once some funds had cleared in a Jersey account, the court heard.

In
March 2009, he took another woman he was looking to fleece to Thailand 
for a fortnight at a cost of £1,690 but the court heard the money came 
from Codd’s account.

And in May that year, he bought a Mercedes SLK Kompressor 200, with Codd supplying the downpayment from his account.

He also bought an Audi TT using money from a friend's account.

Thomas then had £1,500-worth of work done to a jet-ski he wanted - but again had Codd pay the downpayment on his behalf.

The cash was then sent back to Thomas via bank accounts belonging to his brother Steven (left), 43, and former Credit Suisse banker Rory Codd (right), 34, jurors heard

In July 2009, when he found the boat he wanted to buy had been sold, he organised for one to be custom-built for him at a cost of more than £100,000.

Two payments of £20,000 were made by Codd in August 2009 to the boat builder and a further £17,000 was paid by Jason Thomas.

While in Jersey, Jason Thomas bought a £3,460 Rolex watch which he sold days later for a similar price but for cash.

The alleged fraud was discovered in August 2009 when Smith, from St Helier, went on holiday and unusual payments were discovered by workmates.

She was sacked and later convicted of two counts of fraud and sentenced to two years in prison.

Rory Codd, of Kilburn, north-west London, denies three counts of acquiring criminal property and a single count of conspiracy to acquire criminal property.

Steven Thomas, of Brentwood, Essex denies a single count of acquiring criminal property and a single count of conspiracy to acquire criminal property.

The trial continues.
