Complaints about cold-calling telemarketing firms and spam text messages rose more than 40 per cent last year.

The latest figures reveal there were more than 7,000 complaints from the public to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in 2011/12, up from fewer than 5,000 the previous year.

A Panorama investigation on Monday claimed that the Government-regulated service, the Telephone Preference Service, intended to allow people to block cold callers, was being ignored by some telemarketing firms.

Increase: The latest figures reveal there were more than 7,000 complaints from the public to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in 2011/12, up from fewer than 5,000 the previous year

New legal powers mean the worst offenders now face fines of up to £500,000, but despite thousands of complaints to the ICO, the BBC programme revealed there had not been any fines imposed on offending companies for at least 18 months.

Information Commissioner Christopher Graham said: 'Last year we gained tough new powers to tackle unsolicited marketing calls and texts. We are working to identify the operators responsible.

'The ICO has executed search warrants at a number of sites across the UK linked to companies we believe are breaking the law.

'We have also set up an online reporting mechanism on our website that allows people to report any marketing texts or calls from unidentified senders.'

An exact total of 7,095 complaints were received under the Privacy and Electronic Communication Regulations (PECR), which govern electronic marketing, last year, up from 4,953 in 2010/11, the ICO's annual report showed.

Irritating: Cold-calling can provoke a reaction in recipients who often 
choose to opt to get such companies blocked. However, investigative 
program Panorama has claimed that some companies have ignored this

Mr Graham added: 'We are confident that this work will help us identify those responsible.'

Around 17.5 million phone numbers are registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) - a scheme designed to prevent UK-based companies from making unwanted cold calls.

Industry rules say telemarketing firms should crosscheck their database to ensure that people who have asked not to be cold called are left in peace.

But Mike Lordan at the Direct Marketing Association, which runs the TPS, told Panorama that some companies were ignoring the rules.

The UK public receive up to three billion marketing calls a year, Panorama reported.

An ICO spokesman said that while they now have the power to impose fines of up to £500,000, enforcing the rules is not easy given the vast amounts of money that companies which flout the rules stand to make.
