Court battle: Judith Saunders, pictured outside the Court of Appeal, has spent five years trying to get her wedding ring from her ex-husband

A woman who was married for nearly 40 years spent five years fighting a legal battle with her ex-husband to recover her £550 wedding ring.

Judith Saunders has forked out around £100,000 in legal fees fighting him over £7,000 worth of jewellery including the ring.

She said she had supported her ‘unemployed’ husband, Trevor Unwin, when they met and had even bought their wedding rings.

The 66-year-old retired teacher told the Court of Appeal that she mounted her legal battle to recover her 22-carat gold ring because she ‘paid for it and wanted it back’.

The couple met in 1966 and married in 1970.

They separated in 2004, and although they were briefly reconciled, they divorced in December 2007.

During their marriage, Mr Unwin had a successful career as a businessman and amassed assets worth around £1.5million.

Mrs Saunders said that in 2007, just before their divorce was finalised, they signed an agreement splitting their wealth.

She received two Sussex properties worth £500,000 and the right to reclaim ‘jewellery’ from the former matrimonial home. But she claimed that her ex-husband was so determined not to hand over the ring and other pieces of jewellery that he ‘faked a stroke’ when she went to collect them in January 2008.

The court heard that last year after a long legal battle, Mr Unwin handed over the wedding ring, which his ex-wife valued at £550.

But her bid to secure the other three pieces of jewellery – a £4,000 pair of diamond and sapphire earrings, which she said she also paid for, another set of earrings and a designer pearl necklace – was dismissed by a family judge in November last year.

Mr Unwin, who is also 66, denied having the items and was cleared of faking a stroke.

In the Appeal Court, Mrs Saunders criticised the decision as ‘irrational, perverse and bizarre’.

She said that once the ring was returned to her the judge dismissed her argument that she had been ‘denied access to the former matrimonial home and my jewellery’.

Mrs Saunders, who has remarried and lives in Alicante, Spain, said: ‘It all turned on the wedding ring issue [and the fact] my ex-husband gave the ring back to me eventually. But that was just part of my jewellery claim.’

Lady Justice Gloster told Mrs Saunders: ‘I see force in some of the matters you raise.’

But, refusing to grant permission to appeal, she added: ‘I do not think she has enough ammunition (to) have a real prospect of up-ending the judge’s findings of fact.’

Dispute: Trevor Unwin separated from Mrs Saunders in 2004 after nearly four decades together

Urging Mrs Saunders to move on from 
the dispute, she said: ‘I would be doing her no service by allowing this
appeal to proceed. You would be best to try to put it behind you.’

Outside
court, Mrs Saunders said it was a point of principle and not the 
monetary value of the jewellery that had led to her court fight.

‘It
was a 22-carat gold band which I paid for – and I paid for his,’ she 
said. ‘He was unemployed when we married; I was supporting us. I paid 
for it and I wanted it back.’

Mr Unwin called Mrs Saunders a 'very, very bitter woman' Details of the case were revealed during a hearing at the Court of Appeal in London

Last
night Mr Unwin, a retired company director from Forest Row, East 
Sussex, said: ‘She is a very, very bitter woman. I think she keeps 
taking me to court because she is bored in Spain.

‘Mrs
Saunders cleared out our villa in Spain and packed the ring in a box, 
which then sat in storage for years. I discovered it and took it to the 
court, but she didn’t want it. I had to post it to her in the end.’

He denied that his ex-wife had bought the jewellery.
