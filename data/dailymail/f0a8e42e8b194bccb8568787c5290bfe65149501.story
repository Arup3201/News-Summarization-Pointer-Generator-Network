Patrol: Nearly 7,500 phones were seized in prisons in England and Wales in 2013 (stock image)

Mobile phones being used by prisoners will be cut off under tough new laws.

Operators will be forced to block any number traced to an inmate following a number of cases where offenders have stalked victims and witnesses on social media and boasted about their cushy time behind bars.

Prison guards seize around 130 mobiles every week which are frequently used to run rackets inside from drug smuggling to contract killings.

Use of a mobile phone behind bars is already punishable with a sentence of up to two more years in jail and an unlimited fine, but around 7,000 criminals still use them inside.

The most recent figures available show that a total of 7,451 illicit mobile phones were seized in prisons in England and Wales in 2013.

Since 2012 prison governors have had the power to interfere with mobile phone signals to thwart crime bosses operating there by phone.

However the National Offender Management Service estimates it would cost £300million to install the devices at every prison, with operating costs of £800,000 a year.

But under the proposed new legislation to be debated in the Commons today,  once a prisoner’s phone signal has been identified, the Prison Service will be able to apply to a court for it to be disconnected without guards having to find the device itself.

A memo written by Theresa May, the home secretary, leaked to The Sunday Times, says: ‘There are over 7,000 known organised criminals in prison in England and Wales. 

'We know of cases of serious crimes including large drug imports, escapes and murders being organised from prison, enabled by illicit mobile phones.

‘The mobile network operators have told us they are unwilling to disconnect these phones unless compelled by law.’

Ministers estimate the cost of blocking illicit phones and Sim cards will be up to £300,000, with the cost to the mobile firms of up to £212,000.

It will not be necessary to seize the phone or prove that it is being used by a specific prisoner, speeding up the enforcement of the ban on using mobiles behind bars.

Under the plans, prison security chiefs would use new but cheaper technology to detect the use of phones and their numbers.

Prisons already use a range of measures to detect items of contraband with intelligence-led searches, body searches and the use of x-ray machines, metal detectors and CCTV surveillance cameras, as well as body orifice scanners.

But now they will be able to go to a county court with all the numbers from each prison and young offenders' institution and obtain a blacklisting order from the court.

There would be no need for prison officers to find and seize the phones from prisoners who have sophisticated means of concealing their use.

Ministers will table an amendment to the Serious Crime Bill to introduce the measure when it is discussed in Parliament tomorrow.

It follows dozens of cases where inmates have used their smartphones to upload messages and pictures from inside their cells showing their cushy prison lifestyle with access to TVs, gaming consoles and junk food.

In November last year a thug serving a 10-year sentence for stabbing his sister's ex-boyfriend and leaving him for dead boasted about his ‘f****** blinding’ time behind bars.

Joe Bath, 27, from Margate, Kent, was stabbed in the face and beaten so badly that his mother didn’t even recognise him in hospital.

But his attacker Lee Cekic continued to torment his victim from his prison cell, bragging on Facebook that it was ‘all worth it’.

Yesterday Andrew Selous, the prisons minister, said: ‘We will never tolerate the use of mobile phones in prisons. This proposed new legislation will significantly increase our ability to tackle this problem.

‘By ordering a phone to be cut off once it is identified, we will be able to reassure victims and prevent further criminal activity faster and wider than ever before.’
