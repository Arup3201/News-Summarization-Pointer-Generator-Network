The Pennsylvania man who was lured on Craigslist by a young couple who wanted to commit a murder together, was still alive as they searched for a place to dump his body.

Miranda Barbour, 18, told police that Troy LaFerrara, a 42-year-old married man, was still alive - 'choking and gasping for air' - after she stabbed him 20 times.

Initially, Miranda told police that she killed La Ferrara in self-defense after he started to grope her. But her 22-year-old husband Elytte Barbour gave police a different story, saying they conspired to kill a stranger together, and he helped hold La Ferrara down while his wife wielded the knife.

Miranda Barbour was the first to be arrested when police traced LaFerrara's last call to her cell phone. She was charged last Wednesday in his death, followed by her husband on Friday.

Investigators said Elytte Barbour confessed to police the couple planned the killing. He previously told The Daily Item of Sunbury his wife acted in self-defense when LaFerrara, who was married, groped her after hiring her as a ‘companion.’

According to authorities, Miranda advertised herself as a 'companion' on Craigslist and LaFerrara responded. She arranged to pick him up on November 11 at a mall, three weeks after her marriage.

Elytte Barbour says he hid in the back of the car under a blanket until the moment his wife gave him a signal.

He held LaFerrara back with a cable cord while his petite, bespectacled spouse repeatedly stabbed him. LaFerrara's body was discovered the next morning in an ally by Sunbury resident Brittany Settler.

'I was making myself a cup of coffee when I opened the fridge to get the creamer out,' she told WHP. 'I looked out and was like, "What is that?"'

According to police, LaFerrara had keys in his hand but no identification. HIs face was purple.

After dumping their victim's body, the Barbours when to Wal-mart to buy garbage bags, carpet clearer, paper towels and seat covers to clean out the SUV - but it wasn't enough.

'She related that there was a lot of blood and she wasn't able to get it all,' police said.

After that they went to a strip club to celebrate Elytte's 22nd birthday.

The Barbours had recently moved from North Carolina to Pennsylvania after tying the knot October 22.

LaFerrara married his girlfriend of eight years, Colleen Keeney, in June 2011. The couple did not have children.

According to his obituary, LaFerrara was employed as the senior resident engineer at the Lycoming County Landfill.

The couple's arrests comes after Richard Beasley was given the death penalty in April this year after luring three men to an Ohio farm by using Craigslist job posts before killing them in cold blood.

Mr Barbour has been charged with criminal homicide, aggravated assault, simple assault and criminal conspiracy and possession of instruments of crime.

The 22-year-old man told police that he and his wife had plotted to kill someone in the past, but without success. It was not until they came across LaFerrara on Craigslist that their plan finally came together.

‘LaFerrara was just the one with whom it worked,’ Elytte Barbour told police.

Earlier this week, Miranda Barbour gave police a different account of what happened.

She told prosecutors that she would regularly use Craigslist to meet men for 'companionship', often being paid for the meetings up to $850, according to her husband.

But in her first interview, the mom of one insisted that, despite setting up the meeting at the Susquehanna Valley Mall, Hummels Wharf, she didn't go through with it because she was too scared.

Later, Barbour’s husband and friend were then interviewed and told officers they knew Barbour she met men who she had encountered online, and that she carried a pocket knife for her own protection.

But just a day after her first questioning, Barbour voluntarily went to Selinsgrove state police barracks and asked to speak with investigators with an attorney present.

In her second version of events, she said she met LaFerrara on Craigslist and after emailing back and forth, the two decided to meet at the mall, police said.

Original sinner: The first 'Craigslist killer' Richard Beasley, above, was convicted in April after posting job vacancies on the site which used the promise of work on an Ohio farm to lure three men to their deaths

Beasley, 53, was convicted of teaming up with a teenager in 2011 to use the promise of jobs on a southeast Ohio farm to lure the men to their deaths.

A self-proclaimed street preacher, he killed three men, all of who answered a Craigslist ad for a non-existent job.

The slain men were Ralph Geiger, 56, of Akron; David Pauley, 51, of Norfolk, Va.; and Timothy Kern, 47, of Massillon. All were looking for a fresh start in life, prosecutors said repeatedly during the trial.

The murderer was sentenced to death in April this year, after hearing the details of his crime, Judge Lynne Callahan said 'I think I'm going to be sick.

LaFerrara entered Barbour’s vehicle, and once they arrived in Sunbury, LaFerrara told Barbour to pull over, police said.

Barbour told police that she parked and LaFerrara began to grope her, touch her private areas and put his hands around her throat.

According to the teen, it was then that she reached for the knife and began to stab LaFerrara in a frenzied attack. police said.

She said she blacked out and didn’t remember the amount of the times she stabbed him, according to police. She made no mention of her husband playing a role in the killing, or even being present in the car.

She drove around the city and found the alley behind Catawissa Avenue.

She got out of the vehicle and walked around to the passenger’s door, which LaFerrara was leaning against, opened the door and watched him fall out, police said.

Before driving off, the teenager took the man's wallet, the report said.

At a secluded spot, she cleaned away as much of the blood as she could before driving on to join her husband at his birthday party in a strip club.

It is alleged she threw the knife which was used in the attack into the Susquehanna River, which runs through Sunbury and Selinsgrove.
