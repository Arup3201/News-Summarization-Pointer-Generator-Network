A crime museum is displaying the bullet-ridden skull of a pro-Nazi officer who was executed with his own gun as part of a macabre exhibition of Holocaust relics.

The display also features gold teeth extracted from Jews as they entered Auschwitz, muzzles used to German Shepherd dogs who patrolled the camps and attacked prisoners, and a series of syringes used in brutal medical tests on prisoners.

An SS officer's boot - with foot bones still inside - clogs used by Jews at a Nazi death camp, and toys taken from Jewish children also make up the collection at Littledean Crime Through Time Museum in Gloucestershire.

Medical Syringes recovered from Auschwitz at the time of liberation. It is believed they were used to carry out gruesome medical tests on camp prisoners

Museum curator, Andy Jones, 52, said: 'The new exhibit features a collection of artefacts recovered at the end of the holocaust.

'The muzzle worn by a German Shephard dog in Auschwitz is the only one on display in the world.

'The
 prison guards would remove the muzzles and unleash the poison fanged 
hounds onto the prisoners - including pregnant Jewish women.

'Artefacts like the Jew's gold teeth reveal the brutal side of the holocaust.

'The Nazis would remove the prisoners crowns and gold teeth as they came into the camp.

'The guards would wrench them out with pliers and melt them down to create gold bars.'

The skull belongs to a Utase Black Legion Officer.

It shows that his nose brutally smashed as he was pistol-whipped then executed with his own gun.

The Black Legion were a pro-Nazi group who massacred Chetniks, Partisans and Serb civilians during the holocaust.

It is believed that the officer's fatal injuries were inflicted when the prisoners were liberated - and then turned on their captors.

The collection also features Nazi SS insignia rings believed to have once belonged to officers

The collection also shows medical syringes recovered from Auschwitz - the implements were used in the brutal medical tests performed at the camp by the Nazis on the helpless prisoners.

Uniforms worn by inmates of the death camps and wrist restraints used by the Gestapo are a reminder of the atrocities committed during the war, and caps and honour rings worn by SS officers stand in sharp contrast to the tiny dolls confiscated from Jewish children as they entered the death camps.
