Pressure is mounting on the Government to reduce air passenger duty after 100,000 people contacted their MPs complaining the tax is unacceptable.

The UK now has the highest air passenger tax in the world, prompting warnings it is damaging the economy by hitting industry and finances.

Around 75 MPs have also signed an Early Day Motion calling for more Treasury research into the tax, which soared by 8 per cent this year and is an average of £92 per family for a trip to Europe.

Complaining about tax: The UK now has the highest air passenger tax in the world and pressure is mounting on the government after 100,000 people complained

The Fair Tax on Flying campaign, run by an alliance of more than 30 airlines and tour operators, says the tax is deterring both UK holidaymakers heading abroad and foreign travellers hoping to visit Britain.

The cost of APD for a family of four flying to the United States or Egypt is £260, while those heading to the Caribbean are charged £324. Australia is the most expensive, with taxes reaching £368.

Listen: Former LibDem leader Charles Kennedy hopes the Government will listen to complaints and explore the true economic consequences

Virgin Atlantic has calculated this year’s rise in APD will cost passengers an estimated £600million this summer. Over the past seven years, the tax has risen by 360 per cent. Chancellor George Osborne expects to collect £2.2billion in 2011-12 from APD revenues, rising to £3.9billion by 2016-17.

Brian Donohoe MP, chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Aviation, said: ‘For 100,000 people to have written to MPs to make their voice heard is an astonishing show of opposition to the current levels of Air Passenger Duty and concern about the impact they are having on both ordinary families and on the economy.

'I trust the Chancellor takes notice of public opinion and commissions an independent study to look at how APD is damaging the UK economy.’

Former LibDem leader Charles Kennedy is one of the MPs to have signed the motion, which expresses concern about the ‘financial impact on families and their ability to fly’.

He said: ‘I hope the Government will 
listen to the thousands who have written to them and undertake a 
comprehensive impact assessment to establish the true economic 
consequences of the increase of APD.’

Other countries: The Netherlands and Spain have reduced or abolished flight tax after realising it affected visitor numbers

Countries, such as the Netherlands and Spain, have reduced or abolished flight tax after realising it was affecting visitor numbers, which in turn had a detrimental effect on the economy.

APD was first introduced in 1994 with a £5 rate for the UK/EU and £10 elsewhere.

Darren Caplan, chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, added: ‘It is clear beyond any doubt that Air Passenger Duty is now one of the most hated stealth taxes in the UK.’
