Scientists have revealed new insight into the evolution of flight by carrying out a series of wind tunnel experiments based on dinosaur fossils.

After new fossil discoveries sparked debate over the evolution of birds and their abilities to fly, the history of feathered dinosaurs and their flying functions became less clear.

But a group of researchers at the University of Southampton believe they have put an end to speculation by examining the flight performance of the early Microraptor.

To figure out how exactly Microraptor might have flown, a team of scientists from the University of Southampton in the UK designed an anatomically accurate model and tested its abilities for stability and speed in a wind tunnel

The scientists at the University of Southampton designed the model and conducted experiments in a wind tunnel to achieve the fascinating results

The first dinosaur described with feathers on its arms legs and tail lived around 140million years ago and had five potential lifting surfaces.

But the Microraptor implies the evolution of bird flight passed through a four-wing phase, representing an important stage in the evolution of gliding and flapping.

The scientists performed a series of wind tunnel experiments and flight simulations with winds of 45mph, using a full-scale representation of the dinosaur with surprising results.

The experiments showed the Microraptor would have  been most stable gliding when generating large amounts of lift with its wings.

The wind tunnel demonstrated this had certain advantages as the high lift coefficient allows for slow glides, which can be achieved with less height loss. 

The early Cretaceous dinosaur was a paravian--a classification of dinosaurs that were closer to birds than species like the T. Rex

Fossils revealed the Mircroraptor had feathers on its arms, legs and tail as well as wings leading to debate over the evolution of bird flight

For gliding down from low elevations, such as trees, this slow, and aerodynamically less efficient flight was the gliding strategy that results in minimal height loss and longest glide distance.

The results prove debate surrounding the position and orienatation of the dinosaur's legs and wind shape is irrelevant, as these variables made very little difference to the Microraptor's flight. 

Gareth Dyke, a senior lecturer in vertebrate palaeontology at the university and co-author of the study, said: 'Significant to the evolution of flight, we show that Microraptor did not require a sophisticated, 'modern' wing morphology to undertake effective glides, as the high-lift coefficient regime is less dependent upon detail of wing morphology.

'This is consistent with the fossil record, and also with the hypothesis that symmetric 'flight' feathers first evolved in dinosaurs for non-aerodynamic functions, later being adapted to form aerodynamically capable surfaces.'

His co-author, Roeland de Kat, said: 'What interests me is that aerodynamic efficiency is not the dominant factor in determining Microraptor's glide efficiency.

'However, it needs a combination of a high lift coefficient and aerodynamic efficiency to perform at its best.'

The study - Aerodynamic performance of the feathered dinosaur Microraptor and the evolution of feathered flight - is published in the latest issue of Nature Communications.
