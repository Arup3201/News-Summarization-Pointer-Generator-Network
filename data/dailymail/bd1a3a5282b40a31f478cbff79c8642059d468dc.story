James Alexander Gordon, for more than four decades the BBC’s voice of Saturday football results, has died aged 78.

The Scot, whose unique style became instantly recognisable to fans all over the country, had been battling cancer since he retired just over a year ago following surgery to have his larynx removed.

Richard Burgess, head of BBC sports news and BBC radio sport, said: ‘He was a true gentleman who will be greatly missed by all at BBC Sport.

Familiar voice: Gordon read the football results on BBC radio for over four decades

‘James was an iconic radio voice who turned the classified football results into a national institution.

‘He took enormous pride in his work and I know he was greatly touched by all the tributes he received upon his retirement last year.’

Known as JAG, he worked in music publishing before joining the BBC in 1972 as an announcer and newsreader, getting his big break to start reading the classified football scores a year later.

His trademark style of using the tone of his voice to give clues to the result was copied by many but never equalled, as he continued to deliver the results on Radio Two and then Five Live.

Current Match of the Day host and former England star Gary Lineker led the tributes, calling him: ‘the voice of the football results.’

BBC radio pundit Robbie Savage said: ‘Such sad news — what a fantastic man with a great voice.’

Former Everton and England midfielder Peter Reid added: ‘You always remember his voice. It was a big moment in the week of anyone who loved football, especially in the era before social media and instant television coverage.’
