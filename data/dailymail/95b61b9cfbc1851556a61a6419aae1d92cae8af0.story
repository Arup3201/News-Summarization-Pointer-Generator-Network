Police in Brazil are investigating whether a 13-year-old boy thought to have murdered his police officer parents, his grandmother and his great-aunt was actually the fifth victim of a massacre carried out by criminal cops who wanted his mother dead, it was reported today.

Schoolboy Marcelo Pesseghini had been named as the only suspect in the horrific family bloodbath after it appeared he shot each victim in the head early Monday morning at their home in Sao Paulo.

In a tragedy which has shocked Brazil, the teenager then spent a normal full day at school, before returning home where he apparently killed himself.

Murdered: 13-year-old Marcelo Pesseghini is now believed to be the victim of a cover-up in the murder of his parents Luiz and Andreia. It is believed she may have been targeted because she was a police informant

But doubt has now been cast on the 
police's version of events after it was revealed Marcelo's mother, 
Andreia Regina Pesseghini Bovo, 36, had been involved in turning over 
criminal cops in the months leading up to her violent death.

Col Wagner Dimas Pereira, commander of
 the 18th Miliary Police Battalion where Ms Bovo worked, told a radio 
station that the policewoman had passed on information about officers 
who were allegedly stealing money from bank cash machines.

He added that she had provided details
 about various colleagues suspected of being part of a criminal gang 
within the police force, which had led to them being removed from their 
duties.

And he added that he had doubts about 
the involvement of Marcelo in the massacre, who has been described as a 
quiet boy who loved his parents and never as much as got into a fight at
 school.

Col Pereira told Radio Bandeirantes: 
'She never exactly said, that one, that one and that one. But, in the 
context of our investigations, she confirmed a number of details.'

He said none of those accused had been charged with a crime because the investigation was still ongoing.

But he said policemen suspected of 
being involved in the robberies had been transferred to other police 
departments: 'Those ones, we removed them from the picture, those who 
were supposed to be part of the 'group' inside the battalion.'

Col Pereira called on investigators 
into the family's murder not to 'rule out' the hypothesis that Marcelo 
might have been framed by criminal policemen who wanted his mother dead.

He said: 'Let's not throw it out, 
let's look at things carefully, lets see if there is reasoning in what 
we already have, if the pieces of the puzzle really do fit together.'

Police chief Itagiba Franco, in charge
 of investigations into the massacre, said he would look into Col 
Pereira's accusations, but insisted that they 'wouldn't alter the 
direction of the investigation.'

Police believe that Marcelo murdered 
his family at their home in the northern Sao Paulo district of Vila 
Brasilandia in an overnight massacre beginning on Sunday night and 
continuing into the early hours of Monday.

He then stole his mother's care and calmly drove it to school, where he waited for five hours before lessons started.

After getting a lift back home at the 
end of the day by the father of a schoolmate, investigators believe he 
stroked his dead mother's hair before shooting himself in the head.

His father, Luiz Marcelo Pesseghini 
Bovo, 40, a police sergeant with 19-years service, was found in bed. His
 mother Andreia, who had worked in police administration 16 years, was 
found on her knees in the bedroom.

His grandmother, Benedita de Oliveira 
Bovo, 65, and great-aunt Bernadete Oliveira da Silva, 55, who lived in a
 different section of the family's compound, were also both killed in 
bed.

The teenager was found dead from a gunshot to the left temple and his father's police-issue service revolver was found nearby.

A second gun, a .32 caliber revolver, was found inside the backpack the teenager took to school.

Victims: Luiz Pesseghini, 40, a police sergeant with 19 years service was found dead in his bed. Andreia Pesseghini, 30, who had served in the military police for 16 years was found on her knees in the bedroom

However, a number of relatives of the Pesseghinis have voiced their doubts about Marcelo's involvement in the killings.

Sebastico de Oliveira Costa, Mrs 
Pesseghini's brother, said he did not believe the boy had the strength 
to lift and fire the hefty .40 calibre weapon.

He said: 'It makes no sense. This is a heavy gun and he couldn't have had the strength to shoot it'.

And Marcelo's cousin, Sandra Alves 
Feitosa, said: 'If it was a Marcelo who did it, then it was a force of 
evil. He was a boy who was loving and loved by all. He never even got 
into a fight at school.'

Sao Paulo's police are widely regarded
 as among the most corrupt in the world and in recent years officers 
have been mired in numerous scandals.

Death squads within the military police are widely suspected of mass killings and extra-judicial executions.

In January, six military police 
officers were charged with killing seven people in a bar in the Campo 
Limpo district of Sao Paulo.
