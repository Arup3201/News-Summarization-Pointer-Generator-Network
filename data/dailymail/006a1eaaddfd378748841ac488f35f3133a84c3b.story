Former Polish President Lech Walesa  has demanded an eroding of borders between major nation states on the continent

An extraordinary call for Germany and Poland to unite as a single country at the new heart of Europe came yesterday from Lech Walesa, one of the key figures in the demise of the Cold War.

The former Solidarity trade union leader shocked his follow Poles by demanding an eroding of borders between major nation states on the continent.  

We need to expand economic and defence cooperation and other structures to make from the states of Poland and Germany one state of Europe,' said the mustachioed Walesa, 70 this month, who was a staunch opponent of Soviet hegemony in Eastern Europe whose historic industrial action in the Gdansk shipyards ushered in a new era freedom and democracy.

'We have gone so far in our technical advancements that we are no longer located in our own countries,' he told Russian news agency Itar-Tass.  

'There is a broadening of geographical structures, while the economy and democracy should also be altered.'

He insisted that the uniting of his Polish homeland which its bitter wartime enemy Germany was not only possible but the logical conclusion of his own historic role in dismantling the Iron Curtain.

'The Germans have done us a lot more evil, and the relationship we have  now is much better than that with Russia. Why?,' he asked.

'Because after the war, Germany fully confessed to all its dirty tricks. It’s necessary to say once and for all who did something evil, full stop. Until we do, the wound won’t heal.'

The ex-Polish president who won the Nobel Peace Prize said:  'My struggle led to the reunification of Germany and the creation of the state of Europe.

'We destroyed the borders, globalisation is on the horizon.'

The outspoken former politician said Germany 'fully confessed to all its dirty tricks' after the war - including its concentration camps in Auschwitz - so the pair could be united

Claiming the old borders no longer mattered, he said: 'This is the broadening of geographical structures, while the economy and democracy should also be altered.'

Of  building new structures, he said: 'It’s Lego bricks.'

Having faced down the might of one old empire - the USSR - he appeared ready in his rambling remarks to trust a new Euroland and, further still, embraced an almost utopian vision of a world without frontiers.  

'Tomorrow there will be no division to Europe and Asia,' he said.  

'These are old concepts that would remain only on maps. Everything will be united. Companies will be united. IT is a process of structures growing due to the technological progress.

'Right now we are stopped by obstacles of different kinds, like various kinds of disparities, different systems, but gradually we’ll be smoothing it down and the states will become like Lego bricks.

'If a state will have a good shape, it will be possible to build various kinds of structures. 

He insisted that the bitter wartime enemies should unite, despite the atrocities inflicted in World War II as 'globalisation is on the horizon'

'The frontiers will not be visible. Those who have bad parameters would not be able to unite with anyone. The shapes are freedom, democracy, free market, pluralism.'

However, he seemed to question Russia’s ability to join this new club despite recently urging closer relations with this former enemy.

'We need to have similar shapes of those Lego bricks,' he said.  

'If Russia gets the right shapes, it will be possible to work with it.  

'Since Russia is a huge country, a rich country, it has the whole Mendeleev table. Everyone would want to work with it, but it has to have the right shapes so that it will be possible to build something with it.'

Walesa - who called himself 'a leader by nature' - appeared to rule out a return to frontline politics.  'I am too old already,' he said. 'I’m tired.'

'This is one of Lech Walesa’s exotic ideas,' said ex-premier Jozef Oleksy.  

'He has the role of someone who stimulates ideas, sometimes annoying ideas, but I don’t attach much importance to this one.'
