Demands: Prosecutors want captain coward Francesco Schettino jailed for a total of 2,697 years as they made a request to have him sent back to jail

Prosecutors want 'Captain Coward' Francesco Schettino jailed for a total of 2,697 years as they made a request to have him sent back to jail, it emerged today.

Schettino, 52, is currently under house arrest while investigators consider charges of multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship following the Costa Concordia liner disaster last month.

Seventeen lost their lives and at least 17 are still missing after the skipper recklessly changed course and crashed the 114,000-ton liner onto rocks just so that he could carry out a 'sail by' salute and impress crew and friends.

Prosecutors say that the spineless captain then abandoned ship, leaving hundreds of people still onboard, while he reached the safety of dry land on the nearby island of Giglio in a lifeboat.

Last month an investigating judge granted Schettino house arrest and he is currently serving that at his home in Meta di Sorrento near Naples, which he shares with his wife Fabiola and teenage daughter.

Today, in a three hour closed door hearing in Florence before an appeal court judge, prosecutors argued he be sent back to jail as they fear he may well interfere with evidence and the fact that he fled his ship also raises the possibility he may try and avoid justice.

Lead investigator Francesco Verusio is looking for Schettino to be given 15 years for multiple manslaughter, ten years for causing a disaster and eight years for every passenger that was abandoned and the same sentence for those that died, with all terms running consecutively.

That makes a grand total of 2,697 years, as 34 people are believed to have been killed and 300 passengers were abandoned by Schettino the night of the disaster on January 13.

Prosecutors outlined their demands in a 12 page document handed to judges as they presented their request to have him sent back to jail, while his lawyers argued he should be released.

His legal team pointed to the fact that Schettino had been suspended from his post by the Concordia's owners Costa Cruises following the disaster.

And they added that the incident was 'unique and unrepeatable' proof they said he would not flee justice and tamper with evidence.

However, Mr Verusio said Schettino's reaction when he was originally informed he was being placed under investigation and taken to jail underlined the fact he could try and escape.

He said: 'When first told he was going to jail, Schettino asked if he could go to a hotel first and then for something to eat. He also has the possibility of escaping to various places across the world.'

The hearing adjourned its decision until Friday.

Meanwhile newspaper adverts were also published today inviting 4,200 passengers and crew who were on the Concordia to attend a preliminary hearing in Grosseto on March 3.

Twenty three British holidaymakers were on the Concordia but they are not under any legal obligation to attend the hearing which will take place in the town's theatre as the court building is too small.

Costa have already offered compensation of £9,000 to each holidaymaker affected but many have said they will not accept and instead pursue court action for a higher payout.

Bad weather around Giglio has led to the search for victims to be suspended and it had also delayed the removal of 500,000 gallons of heavy duty diesel from the Concordia's tanks.
