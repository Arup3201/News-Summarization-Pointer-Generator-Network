'Explosive' revelations pinning some of the blame for the Libor-fixing scandal on the Bank of England are expected when Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond gives evidence to MPs on Wednesday.

Traders apparently 'mistakenly' believed the Bank was happy for them to fix the rate, following a telephone call between Mervyn King's deputy Paul Tucker and a 'senior' Barclays manager now reported to be Mr Diamond.

The Bank of England has categorically denied anything to do with fiddling the rate which banks borrow money at - which in turn affects how much they charge borrowers on products including mortgages and credit cards.

'Explosive': Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond (left) could give testimony about his discussions with the Bank if England, whose deputy governor is Paul Tucker (right)

The Daily Mail revealed on Saturday that rumours were swirling in Whitehall about what discussions the Bank and the Treasury had with banks about Libor.

The rate acts as a crucial indicator of the health of the banking sector, and therefore the wider economy.

In 2007, experts began to express concern that the rate was rising, suggesting banks were becoming wary of lending to each other.

According to two separate official reports prepared on both sides of the Atlantic, a senior Barclays official and a senior figure at the Bank talked on October 29, 2008.

WHAT IS LIBOR?

It
 stands for the London interbank offer rate and is the interest banks 
charge to borrow from each other. Banks rely on this money to lend to 
customers and businesses. Its equivalent in Europe is called Euribor.HOW DOES IT AFFECT ME?

The
 rate banks pay to raise money affects how much they charge on loans and
 mortgages.  An increase in Libor can add hundreds of pounds to 
households’ annual mortgage repayments or a loan to a small business.

This
 was seen with dramatic effect in the run up to the financial crisis, 
when Libor soared and lenders raised their rates. It is also used as the
 benchmark for trillions of pounds in complex financial investments.

HOW IS IT SET?

The
 rate is set every morning by a panel of banks and overseen by trade 
body the British Bankers’ Association. Each bank sets the rates at which
 it believes it can borrow, from overnight to 12 months. There are 150 
Libor rates, spanning ten currencies and 15 time periods.WHAT HAS BARCLAYS BEEN DOING?

Barclays’ traders speculating on movements in interest rates were manipulating Libor in an effort to make huge profits.

Its
 traders were conspiring with the ‘submitters’ at the bank which lodge 
their Libor rates every morning. Depending on the way they were betting,
 traders would urge these submitters to increase the Libor rate or lower
 it.

Barclays’ traders also
 conspired with ex-employees working at other banks to try to influence 
their Libor submissions. During the financial crisis Barclays also 
fiddled the figures to dupe the market into thinking it was more 
financially sound than it was.

Libor
 is often seen as a barometer of how healthy a bank is. Just as 
customers with bad credit records have to pay higher interest rates, 
banks which are deemed in poor financial health are charged more to 
borrow.

Barclays became 
anxious that its Libor rate was higher than many of its peers and that 
they were fiddling the figures. It decided to join the party.ARE ANY OTHER BANKS DOING THIS?

It is likely this is just the tip of the iceberg. Barclays is just the first to get caught.

For
 the last two years a dozen regulators on three continents have been 
combing through the files of more than 20 banks involved in the rate 
setting process.

Swiss bank 
UBS is understood to have already suspended a number of traders, as has 
the Royal Bank of Scotland. Lloyds, and HSBC last week said they were 
helping the Financial Services Authority with its inquiries.

The Bank official is alleged to have asked why Barclays’ Libor submissions were higher than those of other banks.

The Financial Services Authority’s report on Barclays published on Wednesday said Mr Tucker spoke with a senior Barclays manager now known to be Mr Diamond on October 29 in a routine telephone call.

In it, he made ‘no instruction for Barclays to lower its Libor submissions’.

But the report added: ‘However, as the substance of the telephone conversation was relayed down the chain of command at Barclays, a misunderstanding or miscommunication occurred.

‘This meant that Barclays’ submitters believed mistakenly that they were operating under an instruction from the Bank of England (as conveyed by senior management) to reduce Barclays’ Libor submissions.’

Casting his mind back: Mr Diamond, who is facing calls to resign, is understood to have a 'different recollection' of discussions between Barclays and the Bank to that held by Mr Tucker

Submitters are the managers who give borrowing data to the British Bankers Association’s Libor-setting committees.

The FSA report refers to ‘a telephone conversation between a senior individual at Barclays and the Bank of England during which the external perceptions of Barclays’ Libor submissions were discussed’.

According to the BBC’s business editor Robert Peston, no contemporaneous minute or recording of the conversation was made, but Mr Diamond and Mr Tucker ‘have different recollections of it’.

US documents conclude that Mr Tucker did not give any instruction to artificially depress the interest rates.

A Bank of England spokesman said: ‘It is nonsense to suggest the Bank of England was aware of any impropriety in the setting of Libor.

‘If we had been aware of attempts to manipulate Libor, we would have treated them very seriously.’

But the fact that the pair were talking about Libor at a time when Barclays was submitting false information will leave Mr Diamond, who is due to testify to Parliament on Wednesday, facing difficult questions.

The conversation could also prove awkward for Mr Tucker, who is a leading candidate to succeed Sir Mervyn King as governor next year, as well as prompting questions about whether the Treasury had any similar discussions with the banks.

Business Secretary Dr Cable said yesterday that the public wanted to see bankers prosecuted if they had committed criminal offences, and revealed that ministers would launch a consultation this week on criminal sanctions for directors of failed banks.

‘If there has been criminal activity people must be brought before the courts,’ he told Sky News.

Dr Cable added: ‘[The public] just can’t understand why people are thrown into jail for petty theft and these guys just walk away having perpetrated what looks like a conspiracy.’

However, Lord Turner, chairman of the FSA, said Libor-fixing did not fall foul of the current law.

A Bank of England spokesman confirmed that Mr Tucker was one of the parties involved.

He said: ‘The call referred to in the report was one of many regular market calls made by the Bank of England, in this case by Paul Tucker.’

A Barclays spokesman declined to comment.
