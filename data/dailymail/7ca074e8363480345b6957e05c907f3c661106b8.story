Spain have appointed Gala Leon Garcia as their new Davis Cup captain to replace Carlos Moya who resigned last week.

Leon Garcia is Spain's first ever female captain and just the fifth in the competition's 114-year history.

The 40-year-old reached a career-high ranking of No 27 and now takes charge of the five-time champions for their Europe/Africa Zone Group I campaign next year.

Spain were relegated from the World Group for the first time in 18 years following a 3-1 defeat by Brazil, with former world No 1 Moya stepping down as captain shortly after.

British No 1 Andy Murray tweeted his congratulations to Leon Garcia: 'Congrats to Gala Leon Garcia for becoming first female Spanish Davis cup captain today... hopefully first of many!'

Spain have a first-round bye next year and take on Russia or Denmark in the second round on July 17-19.
