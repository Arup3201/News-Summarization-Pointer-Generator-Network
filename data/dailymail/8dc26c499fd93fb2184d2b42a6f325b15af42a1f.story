Stoke manager Mark Hughes has not given up on his bid to sign Liverpool winger Oussama Assaidi.

The Morocco international spent last season on loan at the Britannia Stadium and Hughes is keen to bring the winger back on a permanent deal.

Initially the Reds' asking price of Â£7million was perceived to be a stumbling block and then reports emerged over the weekend that the player's wage demands were an issue.

However, Hughes remains hopeful an agreement can be reached.

'It's on-going and these things happen. Everybody knows we are interested and that is still the case,' he told The Sentinel.
