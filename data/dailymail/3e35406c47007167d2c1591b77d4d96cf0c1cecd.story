Patricia Dunn, the former Hewlett-Packard chairwoman who authorised a boardroom surveillance probe that ultimately sullied her remarkable rise from investment bank typist to the corporate upper class, has died after a long bout with cancer.

Ms Dunn, 58, died on Sunday at her home in Orinda, California, surrounded by her family. Her sister Debbie Lammers said Ms Dunn's ovarian cancer had returned.

Once one of the most powerful women in corporate America, Ms Dunn saw her career tarnished in 2006 when she was ousted from HP and brought up on criminal charges - which were ultimately dropped - for approving the company's plan to snoop into the private phone records of board members, journalists and HP employees to catch people leaking to the media.

The scandal unfolded as Ms Dunn continued to battle a disease that had haunted her through a sparkling investment banking career and a stormy nine-year stretch on the board of HP, one of the world's largest technology companies.

She had spent time on philanthropic matters in the years since the scandal, Ms Lammers said.

She said she wanted people to remember her sister's 'incredibly influential rise in her professional life and her courage and valiant battles over the course of her treatments'.

Ms Dunn's time at HP coincided with some of the most contentious and challenging periods since the Palo Alto-based company was founded in 1939.

She joined HP's board in 1998 and was instrumental in the hiring and firing of chief executive Carly Fiorina, whose flamboyant personality and ferocity in securing the 19 billion-dollar purchase of Compaq Computer Corporation ultimately helped hasten her departure amid a sagging stock price and disappointing results from the combined company.

Ms Dunn was the one who announced Ms Fiorina's sacking in February 2005 and named her low-key successor, Mark Hurd, previously CEO of NCR.

Mr Hurd himself was ousted last year after an investigation into a sexual harassment claim found inconsistencies in expenses reports filed.

Ms Dunn also assumed Ms Fiorina's role as chairwoman at the time. But she was forced out of that role in September 2006 in an embarrassing scandal involving spying on the telephone records of board members and journalists to ferret out the source of leaks to the media.

Just a month later, California's attorney general charged Ms Dunn and four others with four counts each of conspiracy, fraud, identity theft and illegally using computer data.

That came just two days before she started chemotherapy treatments for advanced ovarian cancer.

The criminal charges against Ms Dunn were eventually dropped, as prosecutors said she had little involvement in the actual 'pretexting' - the ruse used by investigators to view private telephone records by pretending to be someone else - and because of her ailing health.

Charges against the other defendants were also dropped, with a Santa Clara County Superior Court judge calling their 
conduct 'a betrayal of trust and honour' at worst that was not criminal 
behaviour at the time it occurred.

Once
an aspiring investigative reporter, Ms Dunn, a graduate of the 
University of California, Berkeley, found more immediate and lucrative 
work in the financial world and made her mark in investment banking.

After
working briefly as a part-time reporter for a community newspaper in 
San Francisco, she began her corporate climb by capitalising on a 
temporary typist job that she landed at an investment firm in the 1970s.

She was able to turn the two-week typing assignment into full-time work and managed to quickly rise through the ranks by earning a reputation as a hard-edged businesswoman.

That reputation eventually helped her earn the promotion to CEO of fund management behemoth Barclays Global Investors in 1995.

But Ms Dunn's life had been far from charmed.

Financial difficulties dogged her family throughout her childhood and her father, a vaudeville actor, died of a heart attack before she was a teenager.

After his death the family moved to Marin County, north of San Francisco, and her mother's emotional health deteriorated. She later died of breast cancer.

It was at the height of Ms Dunn's corporate success when she was diagnosed with cancer herself, forcing her to step down in 2002 from her role as Barclays CEO to fight breast cancer and melanoma.

Two years later she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and in autumn 2006 she underwent surgery for a metastasised tumour - three weeks before the public learned of the HP investigation that spawned congressional investigations, criminal probes and forced Ms Dunn's resignation.

Ms Dunn is survived by her husband Bill Jahnke; three adult children, Janai Brengman, Michelle Cox and Michael Jahnke; 10 grandchildren; a brother, Paul Dunn, and sister Ms Lammers.
