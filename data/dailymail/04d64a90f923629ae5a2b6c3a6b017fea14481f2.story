For a manager who arrived at White Hart Lane with a reputation for shunning knockout competitions, it now appears that Mauricio Pochettino has finally discovered the magic of the FA Cup.

When Pochettino took over at Tottenham last summer, he was reportedly told by his employers to take the cups seriously, after using the games to rest several first team members at Southampton.

But what perhaps Daniel Levy and Co did not envisage was the Argentine coach plotting a trip to the recording studio should Spurs reach the FA Cup final, following in the footsteps of Tottenham's 1981 cup hero Ossie Ardiles.

Ardiles and his team-mates recorded the infamous Ossie's Dream with Chas and Dave that year, with the song reaching No 5 in the charts as Spurs lifted the cup after beating Manchester City 3-2 in a replay.

'I know all about Ossie's Dream,' confessed Pochettino to The Sun. 'I have heard the song and even seen a video of it.

'Would I record a song with Chas and Dave if we get to the final this season? Maybe. Yes, why not?'

Pochettino stopped short at saying he would be singing too much on any potential collaboration.

'I would let my staff sing because they have good voices and I don't!'

While Tottenham supporters will now undoubtedly be hoping to hear a team single ahead of a cup final, music lovers across the nation will be hoping Pochettino is not about to usher in a new era of football songs.

It has become less of tradition in recent years, but still one responsible for tunes such as The Anfield Rap by Liverpool ahead of the 1988 FA Cup final and Move Move Move (The Red Tribe) by Manchester United ahead of their Cup triumph in 1996.
