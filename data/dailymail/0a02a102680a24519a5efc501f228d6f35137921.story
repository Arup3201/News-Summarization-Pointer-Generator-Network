Last night's episode attracts 8.2million viewers - Channel 4's highest ratings since Big Brother in 2008

It's become the hit TV show that everyone is talking about as viewers marvel at the lavish and elaborate weddings and their traditional and old-fashioned culture.

But one woman has slammed My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding and said it has tarnished the traveller community.

Caroline - not her real name - said the popular documentary show doesn't portray traveller culture and has been an embarrassment for them.

In order to speak out, she has insisted on being anonymous for fear of revenge attacks by families featured in the show. 

Exaggerated: A traveller woman has spoken about My Big Fay Gypsy Wedding and said it didn't portray real traveller life

‘It’s mad, but just saying these things could get me killed. If I was
 identified I would have to go into hiding with my children.

'Disrespecting people in the community ends in big fistfights'.

‘You’re not allowed to criticise another family. They would say, “Who are you to contradict me and my family?”’

Speaking to Reveal magazine, Caroline said when she heard about the programme, she was excited about a show about her community.

But she now thinks the show has tainted their lives and she first 
noticed it was proving to be a problem when she tried to arrange her 
son's first Holy Communion and was turned away by the priest.

Insulting: 'Caroline' said Christine Bleakley should not have worn that dress as it made travellers a laughing stock

'I thought it was good that people would be made aware of travellers. We suffer a lot of discrimination.

'You're
 always scared that the neighbours will find out who you are and the 
kids will get bullied. We can't even book wedding receptions under our 
real names. If the venue finds out, they cancel.'

She said: 'Millions have watched it, but all anyone is talking about are the dresses. We're a laughing stock.

'When Christine Bleakley wore a big pink wedding dress on Daybreak, it was very insulting. You wouldn't dare laugh at an Indian woman in a sari.'

Forced: In last night's episode, Paddy and Roseanne Doherty go shopping for furniture for their house - but Caroline said gypsies can no longer get pitches for their caravans

Caroline said she is not alone in thinking the show doesn't portray the real travelling community.

Firstly, she said that no traveller chooses to live in a house - they are forced to.

She
 said: 'Travellers can't get onto the sites anymore and are forced to 
live in houses. There aren't enough pitches and councils refuse to make 
new ones.'

And she said their dresses are nothing like the elaborate and expensive ones featured on the show.

She said: 'You didn't get a big dress for First Communion, it was a 
hand-me-down or borrowed. My wedding dress was big and white but not as 
big as the ones in the show.'

‘Lots of travellers phoned up the programme to say we aren’t like that. But it’s too late.

'They haven’t shown the weddings and communions where travellers wear normal dresses.

Naive: Caroline believes that the parents of the young children who dressed and danced provocatively, didn't realise how it would come across

Exploited: Caroline said they boys who exaggerated that they can drink from the age of 11 were probably exploited by the cameras

‘Even the show’s name is wrong. Most of the families on the show are Irish Travellers, not gypsies. Gypsies are English.’

She also said she thought a lot of the families featured on the show had been exploited, especially the parents of the young girls who dressed and danced provocatively.

Caroline added: 'Those little girls have watched their older sisters dancing to Beyonce. A lot of the party clothes have been copied from shows like Strictly Come Dancing.

'I don't think the families realised how it would come across. And I think some of the travellers exaggerated things, like the boy who claimed you can drink from the age of 11.

'I bet he feels silly now. Really, they've all been exploited by the cameras.'

Caroline felt that she had to speak out about the show but protected her name for fear of reprisals from other traveller communities for speaking out.

She said: 'It's mad, but just saying these things could get me killed. If I were identified I would have to go into hiding with my children.'

Tuesday night's episode of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding attracted 8.2million viewers - the highest rated Channel 4 show since the 2008 series of Big Brother.
