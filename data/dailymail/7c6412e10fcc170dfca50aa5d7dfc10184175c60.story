This won't fly with patriotic bird watchers. Emus once farmed for their meat, oil and eggs have been left stranded in desperate conditions in India after local demand for the birds plummeted.

In a sad state of affairs, the Indian emu industry has collapsed, leaving thousands of Australia's most iconic birds to roam the subcontinental wilderness without homes or purpose.

Businessweek reports the local emu population in India has shrunk from 2 million in 2012 to just 800,000 after the market for the flightless avian species took a swan dive.

By the end of the year, experts predict only 350,000 emus will remain in India. Many emus are now living in squalid conditions in shelters around India, the less lucky have been destroyed.

Farmed for their meat, leather, eggs, and oil, emus became a popular commodity in India around five years ago but the industry never managed to soar to great heights.

Hundreds of emu ranches were set up around India but too many birds and not enough room led many farmers to abandon their stock in the wild, Businessweek reports.

The report cited ballooning feed costs and smaller returns for emu meat as the main reason behind the shrinking industry.

'There was a sudden explosion in the number of people entering this business, and there was an oversupply in the market,' vice president of the Emu Farmers Welfare Association Purshotam Rao told Businessweek.

'I have six emus...and no one wants to purchase them.'

A typical emu egg can yield as many as 12 regular-sized omelets.
