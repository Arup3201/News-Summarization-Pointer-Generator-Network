A cook at a New Mexico facility that trains state corrections employees has been charged with battery over a series of unhygienic accusations including that she allegedly licked the insides of sandwiches that were then served to probation and parole officers.

Yolando Arguello, 59, was arrested this week after management at the South Valley New Mexico Women's Recovery Academy in Albuquerque heard about her alleged behavior.

Authorities interviewed other kitchen staff and heard how Arguello had been seen licking cheese slices and then inserting them into sandwiches.

She was also accused of dumping ice on the floor, scooping it into pitchers and pouring tea into them before giving the drinks to diners.

It has also been alleged that she would suck on ice cubes, spit them into a cup, and then serve the container to officers, reports KOAT.

Arguello was apparently heard to say: 'I don't work for Probation/Parole. I don't have to serve them. I will show them who is special; better than others.'

She has been charged with three counts of battery on a peace officer and is barred from working at the facility until her case is resolved.
