A model village has been handed Grade II listed status for the first time, English Heritage said today.

The 1:9 replica of Bourton-on-the-Water in Gloucestershire, which was opened more than 75 years ago in May 1937, has been recognised by the body for its historical and architectural significance.

The actual village has a whopping 117 buildings with Grade II listed status - and now the model version has qualified too thanks to its authentic portrayal of Cotswolds style and environment.

Impressive: The 1:9 replica of Bourton-on-the-Water in Gloucestershire, which was opened more than 75 years ago in May 1937, has been recognised by the body for its historical and architectural significance

To scale: The actual village has a whopping 117 buildings with Grade II listed status - and now the model version has qualified too thanks to its authentic portrayal of Cotswold style and environment

Location: Visitors' first view of the model village site

The model village even features a miniature version of itself! This is the front entrance

Lovingly re-created: the miniature version of the village war memorial  

It is situated within the gardens of Grade II listed building The Old New Inn - and was thought to be only the second of its kind in Britain when commissioned by the Morris family, who owned the inn.

The model attraction, which represents the village that has become known as the Little Venice of the Cotswolds, was built by eight local builders and craftsmen over five years, reported The Guardian.

Construction involved local limestone and tiny Cotswold stone slates, and it is such an impressive reproduction that visitors can even view pews and moulded kneelers inside the two parish churches.

The model village also replicates the lanes of houses - some of which date back to the 1600s.

Deborah Williams of English Heritage told the Guardian: ‘It even has the model of itself in the back garden of this miniature pub. It's delightful, unusual, and quite precise in every detail.’

Water mill: The Morris family remained owners of the inn and model village until 1999 when it was bought by Julian and Vicki Atherton, who said the buildings have changed little since the 1930s

Inspirational: the idea came from the miniature village built at Bekonscot in Buckinghamshire

The idea for the project is believed to come from the model village in Bekonscot, at Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire, which was the first built in England in the 1920s.

The Morris family remained owners of the inn and model village until 1999 when it was bought by Julian and Vicki Atherton, who said the buildings have changed little since the 1930s.

But Mrs Atherton added: ‘Shops change hands constantly, so we endeavour to keep the shop signs up to date.’

Heritage minister Ed Vaizey said it was a ‘highly unusual listing’ but ‘no less worthy’ of its status.

He told the Guardian: ‘I'm delighted that in listing we have preserved the work of the local people who built the model village and protected its history for future generations.’

Big impression: A Japanese tourist walks past the pub

Strong resemblance: the model village's version of the local high street features the same shops

Place of worship: the Baptist Church has been captured in great detail
