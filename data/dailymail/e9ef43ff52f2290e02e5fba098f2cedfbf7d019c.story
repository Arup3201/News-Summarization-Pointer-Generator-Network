Boasting twinkling Santas, flashing Christmas trees and a whole herd of illuminated reindeer, this dazzling cul-de-sac could be Britain's most festive street.

Six families in Trinity Close, in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, have strung up more than 100,000 fairy lights across their roofs, lawns and garden fences.

The spectacular display attracts thousands of visitors every year, and the donations they make help the residents raise thousands of pounds for local cancer hospices.

Dazzling: A collection of shooting stars, Christmas trees and Santas cover the homes of Trinity Close in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset

Spectacular: Six festive homes on the street have draped more than 100,000 fairy lights across their roofs, garages and garden fences

Twinkling: The impressive displays attract thousands of visitors each year and raise thousands of pounds for local cancer hospices

Tasteful: The tradition was started 12 years ago by two couples on the street - since then, other families on the street have joined in

Nick Gardner, 46, and his wife Hazel, 45, started the tradition 12 years ago with neighbours Chris Woodberry, 68, and his late wife Christine, who died in 2010 aged 61. The trust that the money is donated to was set up in her name.

Mrs Gardner said: 'We've moved the lights around a little bit this year and we've got a couple of new ones. I've noticed quite a few people have put a few more new lights out this year. Everyone's getting involved, as usual.

'Luckily, once again we haven't come across any problems, everyone seems keen to get involved and join in. We've even got new neighbours this year who decided to buy decorations and keep up the tradition, which is fantastic.'

Since the tradition started, the other households in the street have joined in the festive fun and added more and more lights - mostly in white and blue.

Paula Payne, 67, who lives next door to Mr and Mrs Gardner, has been taking part in the decorations since moving in with husband Graham, 73, nine years ago.

She said: 'We take part every year and this year is no different. We even brought a couple of new lights for this display.

Glittering: The houses, gardens and gates of the street will be illuminated between 4pm and 10pm every day until 1 January

Playful: A herd of twinkling reindeer graze on the lawn in front of one house - as a life-size Santa waves to visitors from his illuminated sleigh

Impressive: Visitors admire the beautiful displays on two of the homes on the street. They are asked to make a charitable donation

'We have got reindeer and twinkling lights, it's all very tasteful. We've been here nine years and gradually built up our collection. We don't spend lots of money.

'It's lovely really, when I was a child neighbours knew neighbours and neighbours helped neighbours. With all the lights we have the same kind of attitude here, we all get to know each other.

'Lots of people like the lights, lots and lots of people come to see them. The switch on is always nice, we have a choir, mince pies and mulled wine.

'It's so nice that we can carry on with it every year, it's such a lovely community feel.'

Close: One resident said that the lights foster a community feel and that they give neighbours an opportunity to get to know each other better

Celebration: The switching on of the lights is marked each year with a choir, mince pies and mulled wine, one resident said

Tribute: Donations made by visitors go to Petals, a charitable trust set up in memory of resident Christine Woodbury, who died in 2010

Visitors are asked to make a donation in a number of collection boxes around Trinity Close. Last year the display raised £8,250. It has raised more than £50,000 since the neighbours started collecting for charity eight years ago.

Donations go to Petals, a charitable trust set up in memory of Christine Woodbury, to benefit local cancer hospices and BARB, a registered charity that operates two life-saving rescue hovercraft and an inshore rescue boat in the Bridgwater Bay area.

The lights are lit between the hours of 4pm and 10pm each day from 1 December to January 1. 

Family get an enormous Christmas tree from M&S a year after being burgled 

A family have been given an enormous Christmas tree from Marks & Spencer - a year after their house was raided by burglars. 

The Penniston family in Maulden Bedfordshire, were surprised with the 25ft tall tree, which is decorated with more than 100 metres of fairy lights, after being nominated by friends and neighbours.  

It comes a year after Nicola, 35, and her husband Christopher, 38, returned home from a shopping trip to find that thieves had taken the presents they had bought for their children, Finlay, seven, and Jasmine, 12. 

Enormous: Nicola and Christopher Penniston with their children Finaly and Jasmine. The 25ft tree bursts through the roof of the family home

Surprise: The tree shoots up through the bedroom of seven-year-old Finlay, who was left terrified after the house was burgled last year

The thieves had also taken a number of sentimental items including photo albums, jewellery, and the children's first teeth. 

Mrs Penniston, an HR consultant, said: 'Last Christmas was a tough time for us - we just didn’t have a Christmas at all in the end. The most upsetting part was losing all the irreplaceable items.'

But she said that this year the sight of her children's smiling faces had brought back the feeling of Christmas cheer.  

The tree is covered with a hundred decorations created by school children from around the UK and also contains details of kind deeds. The surprise, organised by Marks & Spencer, was part of their Two Fairies Christmas campaign.

Christmas treat: The family lost presents, jewellery and photo albums when their home was raided by burglars in December last year

Touching: The tree is decorated with baubles and figures made by schoolchildren - and strung with more than 100 metres of fairy lights

A further 49 trees are set to be delivered to deserving families and organisations who are nominated by the public on Twitter using @thetwofairies account or £followthefairies.

The two fairies, called Magic & Sparkle, top the incredible tree themselves where it emerges out the roof of the family’s two storey home. 

Finlay said: 'This is the most epic Christmas we’ve ever had. I couldn’t believe it when I saw the tree!

'I don’t know how the fairies did it. Last Christmas I was scared to even go in my bedroom, now it’s the best room ever!'

Mrs Penninton added: 'It’s so nice of the two fairies, they’ve really made our Christmas. The kids are beside themselves with excitement.'
