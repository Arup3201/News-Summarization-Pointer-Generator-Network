Dave Whelan has found himself an ally in Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston, who insists his Wigan counterpart is not a racist.

The 77-year-old is under investigation by the FA after remarks made when trying to defend the Latics’ decision to appoint Malky Mackay as their new manager.

Whelan claimed that Jewish people ‘chase money’, also referring to the Chinese community as ‘chinks’.

He had been trying to take the heat off his new boss by playing down the racist, sexist and homophobic texts sent and received by the Scot while he was at Cardiff.

And while Whelan – who has promised to resign if he is found guilty of misconduct - has been widely condemned, Oyston moved to back him up.

The Seasiders’ chief told the Blackpool Gazette: ‘I think it’s horrendous how people can twist and not take into the context Dave Whelan’s comments.

‘I’ve known him on a personal level for the past 10 years and that man is not a racist or a bigot. He says things as he sees them and is from a different generation but he’s certainly not a racist.

‘I think it’s the sickening sections of the gutter press – vultures who are waiting to swoop and have taken someone apart who clearly doesn’t deserve it.’

Mackay himself is still under investigation by the FA for his part in the text scandal uncovered by Sportsmail in August.

Whelan tried to back down from his comments when contacted by Sportsmail last week.

He said: ‘I don’t know how it’s come across but it’s unfair if it’s come across like that. What I said is this: Malky criticised somebody and called them a name. We all get called names. We get called Limeys, Brits. The Scots get called Jocks. And we don’t take a blind bit of notice. I don’t know what all this is about.

‘There’s a big difference if you criticise a black person because that is something I would never ever do or agree to.

‘I would never even dream of that. That is something that is totally taboo. Everybody on the planet is equal and everybody who plays football is equal and I believe in that. I go to Barbados a lot.

‘I have friends, black people, white people, everybody is the same and everybody should be treated the same on the planet and that’s all I have to say on the subject. We are all equal under the sun. OK?’
