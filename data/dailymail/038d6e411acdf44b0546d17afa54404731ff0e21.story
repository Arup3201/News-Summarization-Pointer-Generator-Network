A natural gas explosion wrecked a tall apartment building in the Argentine city of Rosario on Tuesday, killing at least eight people, injuring 60 and causing officials to evacuate much of the downtown. Officials said 19 people were unaccounted for.

Dozens of people were trapped for a time in the upper floors of the burning building as a plume of smoke billowed up over the country's third-largest city.

The building's front and back facades were ripped open, exposing the shattered remains of apartments inside.

Blast: The building and its surrounding area were totally wiped out in the explosion

Victims: Nine were killed in the explosion while many are still unaccounted for

Firefighters working from above and below pulled people out of windows and off balconies as the bottom floors burned.

The explosion damaged other buildings for
 blocks around, and fearing a collapse, police closed buildings and 
schools in a five-block radius.

Rosario Mayor Monica Fein confirmed the death toll and said the blast was likely caused by a gas leak. Fein said 19 people were on a list of missing.

'We're working with our best teams and
 continue looking under rubble,' Fein said. 'We have information that 
shows that this was clearly an issue with the gas.'Â 

Some survivors were outraged and were 
shown on local television venting their anger on the streets.

They said 
they reported a gas leak about 40 minutes before the blast, which 
happened at 9:30 a.m., but said their warning calls went unanswered.
