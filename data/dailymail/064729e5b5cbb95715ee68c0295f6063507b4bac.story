Former brewery boss Lord Hodgson, pictured, has blamed the increasing size of Britain's Muslim population for the growing rate of pub closures

A Tory peer, who is a former brewery boss, has claimed that the closure of many British pubs is partly due to an increase in the size of the country's Muslim community. 

Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, who is a former director of pub chain Marston's, said pubs are closing in areas with growing Muslim communities. 

Speaking in the Lords, Lord Hodgson said: 'Twenty-five years ago, the company of which I was a director would have operated probably a dozen pubs in Kidderminster, the home of the carpet trade. The carpet trade has gone and there are three pubs left.

'In areas of Nottingham, Leicester, Manchester, Leeds and Birmingham the increase in the Muslim population who don't drink leads to many pub closures.

'It is exceptionally hard for a publican who has put 10 years of his life into trying to build up a business to accept the inevitability of these tides of history.'

He said the issue was one of the three main reasons pubs were going out of business, along with the 'inexorable rise of regulation' and the availability of low price alcohol in supermarkets.

He added: 'The reasons for closure may be portrayed as rapacious owners increasing rent wishing to profit by turning pubs into houses or corner stores, but the tide is running against the ordinary pub.'

Lord Hodgson said there was a danger companies would not invest in improving pubs if landlords could opt out of tied arrangements.

'No pub owner is going to invest many thousands of pounds, hundreds of thousands of pounds in some cases, if the tenant can then walk away from supplier agreements,' he said.

He said removing the tie would remove the 'ladder' by which many people could become self-employed landlords.

Lord Hodgson criticised a Commons decision allowing pub tenants to opt-out of agreements with their landlords to provide beer. 

He said he was disappointed that the Government will not seek to overturn their Commons defeat. 

The defeat happened after MPs backed a cross-party amendment to the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill. 

Lord Hodgson said pubs are under threat in areas such as Leeds, Nottingham, Leicester and Birmingham

Business Minister Baroness Neville-Rolfe said the government would accept the principle of the amendment and include it in the legislation in a workable fashion. 

However, leaders of Britain's Muslim community criticised Lord Hodgson's comments. 

Fiyaz Mughal, director of Faith Matters, an organisation which is inter-faith and anti-extremist, told the Independent: 'It is quite ridiculous to blame Muslims for the closure of pubs when in fact the consumption and marketing of alcohol has also changed over time. What is also clear is that some pubs have been successful and others have not been able to generate customers and clients.' 

Nasima Begum, of the Muslim Council of Britain added: 'It is surprising and disappointing for Lord Hodgson to scapegoat Muslims for the failure of his business. What next? Muslims to be blamed for a fall in pork scratchings sales? We have come to a stage where it is easy for those in prominent positions to make their points at the expense of Muslims.'
