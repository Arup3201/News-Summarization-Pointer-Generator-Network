Jonathan Martin could sue the Miami Dolphins for big money under a variety of workplace laws - and could turn to his own legal eagle mother for advice.

The employment legislation makes employers liable for bullying, harassment and discrimination - even if the team's hierarchy didn't know about it, according to several legal experts.

The NFL's special investigator, Ted 
Wells, plans to meet in New York today with Martin, who has been with his family in Los 
Angeles and is receiving counseling. Dolphins owner Stephen Ross also 
plans to meet at a later date with Martin.

Interestingly, Martin's
mother, Jane Howard-Martin, spent almost 20 years practicing employment
law and wrote numerous articles in legal journals on such issues as 
workplace discrimination and harassment. It's not known whether she has 
any role in her son's decisions; Howard-Martin is now assistant general 
counsel for Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. in Los Angeles.

Jonathan Martin arrived at the office of the NFL lawyer investigating the team's bullying scandal on Friday.

The league is trying to gather information about the harassment Martin says he was subjected to by teammate Richie Incognito.

Martin and a companion arrived at lawyer Ted Wells' Manhattan office building and were met by a crush of reporters. The offensive lineman smiled but did not respond to questions while entering the building.

Suing the Dolphins could be more 
successful than bringing criminal charges against offensive lineman 
Richie Incognito, who was suspended by the Dolphins after fellow lineman
Martin left the team two and a half weeks ago.

Martin's attorney, David Cornwell, says Martin was repeatedly harassed 
by Incognito and others in ways that 'went far beyond the traditional 
locker room hazing'.

For Martin to win a lawsuit, Nova Southeastern University law professor Bob Jarvis said he'd have to show precisely that.

'It
will be crucial for Martin to convince a jury that even with a rough 
workplace, there is a line that cannot be crossed and it was crossed 
here,' Jarvis said.

One path for Martin to take would be filing a grievance with the NFL players union or a complaint with the NFL itself.

Aside
from that, legal experts say there are several avenues he could take to
sue the Dolphins. Cornwell did not respond to an email asking for 
additional comment on any of these options.

Two labor-employment lawyers at Venable 
LLP in New York, Michael Volpe and Nicholas Reiter, said in a written 
analysis of the Martin matter that employers can face lawsuits related 
to bullying if the harassment involved a victim's race, religion, sexual
orientation or disability.

Claims can be made for harassment, infliction of emotional distress and negligent supervision.

One voicemail that has surfaced from Incognito to Martin, who is black, included a racial slur and other Dolphins players have said use of the slur in the locker room was not out of the ordinary.

In addition, Volpe and Reiter said that Martin could claim that he was essentially forced to leave the Dolphins because of workplace harassment.

'Even if the Dolphins were unaware of Incognito's alleged behavior, which may be the case, the organization could still face claims of liability,' they said.

There have also been reports that Incognito was told by coaches to 'toughen up' Martin, which could show the team did have knowledge about the harassment, the two lawyers said.

Still, it's no slam dunk for Martin.

For example, one allegation is that Martin forked over $15,000 for veteran Dolphins teammates to take a trip to Las Vegas that he did not attend. That could be viewed in court as being a willing participant and make a harassment lawsuit harder to prove.

If, Jarvis said: 'Martin seemed to be going along with the conduct willingly, then Martin cannot now change his mind and decide that he didn't want to be part of the culture.'

For Incognito himself, the main issue would likely be his future NFL playing career. The NFL players' union announced Thursday that Incognito has filed a grievance over his indefinite suspension by the Dolphins. The union statement says that Incognito is requesting an expedited hearing so he can resume playing football immediately.

Tamara Lave, a law professor at the University of Miami, said the current national focus on bullying and hazing in schools and at the workplace would figure in Martin's favor should he take legal action. Especially, she said, because he is a physically imposing NFL player — 6-foot-5, 312 pounds — who is typically perceived as having few weaknesses.

'The fact that you have a 300-pound man who feels so threatened and uncomfortable that he leaves, that's an indication of how serious it was,' Lave said.

From the criminal standpoint, former prosecutor David S. Weinstein said it's possible but not likely that Incognito could be charged with extortion if he made threats to force Martin to pay the $15,000 for the Vegas trip. Another option would be written threats to do bodily harm, based on Incognito's texts to Martin making threats about his mother.

'However, I don't really see the (state prosecutors) going after Incognito, but I could be wrong,' Weinstein said.

Florida does have an anti-hazing law, but Jarvis said it applies only to educational institutions and not adult workplaces.
