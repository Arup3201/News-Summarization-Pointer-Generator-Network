An MP has hit out at claims White Dee's appearances on a Magaluf bar crawl will aid her recovery from depression - branding her jaunts to Majorca 'the most outrageous back to work programme I’ve ever heard of'.

The Benefits Street star is continuing to claim handouts despite announcing plans to join revellers at a second 'Carnage Magaluf' night next month.

She'll appear at the event unpaid in a move her agent says will help her shake off the depression that prevents her from finding paid employment.

White Dee has agreed to appear at another Carnage Magaluf night in June after she was pictured downing shots in the party resort last month

Her agent says the trip is one of a number planned for Dee over the summer to 'get her used to going to work'

Agent Barry Tomes said: 'Like anyone who goes to work, she has to get used to being away from her street, from her kids, and that is what she is doing now.'

But MP Simon Danczuk has blasted the arrangement, which he says undermines public faith in the benefits system.

Mr Danczuk told MailOnline: 'This is the most outrageous back to work programme I've ever heard of.

'We need to restore public confidence in the welfare state and cases like this show why so many people believe it isn't working.

'If she's fit enough to be doing promotional work in Magaluf then she's surely fit enough to get a job. They should stop her benefits now.'

Single mother-of-two Dee, real name Dierdre Kelly, sparked public anger by downing shots and cocktails as she 'headlined' her first night at the party resort last month.

During her last trip to Majorca, she was spotted kissing a young fan on a sun lounger

After she was a huge hit with revellers, bar crawl organisers Carnage Magaluf have now booked her to appear at another night next month

She was photographed sipping champagne during the trip, but later claimed she 'hated the stuff'

It was announced this week that the 
42-year-old will appear before party-goers on another 'Benefits 
Street-themed night' on June 27.

But
 - as the trip is being funded by her agent Barry Tomes - Dee will 
continue to claim the estimated £10,000-a-year she gets in handouts including 
Employment and Support Allowance (ESA).

Mr Danczuk contrasted White Dee's case to that of Rochdale's Sheila Holt, who was given a public apology from the government after she was sent a letter by benefits bosses demanding she find work - despite being in a coma following a heart attack.

He said: 'It's frankly insulting that I have a constituent in a coma that the Government are hassling while White Dee is galavanting around Europe and making a mockery of the system.'

Labour MP Simon Danczuk has called for Dee's benefits to be stopped to restore public faith in the system

The TaxPayers' Alliance has also called on authorities to ensure state support is only going to those who need it.

Campaign manager Andy Silvester said: 'ESA is rightly there to help some of the most vulnerable people in society who are in need of extra support.

'Of course no-one in receipt of ESA should be denied the opportunity to enjoy themselves, but rigorous systems need to be in place to ensure that those receiving taxpayer-funded benefits genuinely require them.

'The authorities need to make sure that nobody is making unnecessary claims on the welfare system.'

But Dee's agent, Mr Tomes, has claimed the holidays will benefit the taxpayer in the long run.

He said: 'This is not someone with a broken foot, this is a condition she's had for several years. I guarantee by the end of this I will have her working and she will be paying tax.'

The Department of Work and Pensions has refused to say whether it will investigate the arrangement, insisting it never comments on individual cases.

But a spokesman said: 'If we receive information or evidence which suggests a claimant is being paid in kind for work, the Department has powers to treat this as earnings and this may affect their entitlement to ESA.'

A four-night stay in June at the hotel where Carnage Magaluf takes place currently costs around £650, with the cheapest return flights from Birmingham to Majorca for that weekend going for around £150.

When Dee's food and drink are factored in, it is estimated she could be enjoying what amounts to a £1,000 holiday while continuing to claim benefits.

But Mr Tomes added: 'This is not payment in kind. It is the same as if a friend of Dee's invited her to London for the weekend, that wouldn't affect her benefits.

'She is not claiming Job Seekers Allowance so she does not need to sign on, she has to go to a doctor once a month.

'I've talked to the doctor to check it is safe to take her away and we've been in contact with the Department of Work and Pensions and told them what we are doing.'
