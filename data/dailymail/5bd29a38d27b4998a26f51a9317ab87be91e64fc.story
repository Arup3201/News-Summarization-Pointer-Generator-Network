A BBC reporter famously caught ranting at a member of the Church of Scientology has published a new book claiming the cult believes the Holocaust was planned and carried out by psychiatrists.

John Sweeney's tirade against Scientology spokesman Tommy Davis went viral five years ago after he was filmed during a heated interview for a BBC Panorama documentary.

He has since apologised for his 'very public meltdown', but says he remains 'gravely troubled' by the influence of Scientology.

Ready for legal fight: Panorama reporter John Sweeney has written a a book which claims the Church of Scientology believes the Holocaust was planned and carried out by psychiatrists

The central tenet of the religion - founded by L Ron Hubbard in 1952 - is that an extraterrestrial being called Xenu brought billions of people 
to earth in spaceships.

Mr Sweeney has now written a new book called The Church of fear: Inside the Weird World of Scientology which he admits places him at risk of facing libel action.

Writing in the Independent, he said: 'I lost my temper with Tommy Davis inside the brainwashing section of the Church's exhibition on psychiatry (called) The Industry of Death.

'Scientologists believe that psychiatry is Nazi pseudoscience. They believe that the Holocaust was planned and carried out by psychiatrists.'

Mr Sweeney said he has teamed up with a
'bloke with a dog I met in a park' to produce his book because he 
claims all the major publishers turned him down, with some citing libel 
risk as the reason.

He says
his 'dog bloke' is literary agent-turned-publisher Humfrey Hunter, 
whose father and grandmother, he claims, were German-Jewish 
psychiatrists who wrote a book setting out medical evidence that Mad 
King George suffered from porphyry.

A niece of Scientology leader David 
Miscavige also has a book out later this month about her life in the 
church and how she escaped its clutches.

Jenna Miscavige Hill, 28, daughter of David's older brother Ron, has been a frequent critic of the Church of Scientology since publicly breaking with it in 2005.

In Beyond Belief: My Secret Life Inside Scientology And My Harrowing Escape, she will reveal 'strange and disturbing' details about growing up in the church and will provide a first-hand account of Scientology's 'upper ranks', its publishers William Morrow say.

Mr Sweeney says he is ready to fight a legal battle with the cult, which has been known to take libel action in the past, and claims he is supported by a number of former Scientology members.

They include, he claims, Mike Rinder who quit the Church after goading Mr Sweeney, alongside Mr Davis and Marc Headley.

'Getting the book out has not been easy,' Mr Sweeney wrote in the Independent.

'You don't need capital to publish a book on Scientology â€“ you need courage.'

Scientology has been dogged by controversy almost since the day it was created.

The belief was founded in 1952 by L Ron Hubbard who until then had been known for writing pulp and science fiction novels.

Followers
believe that inside them are ancient alien beings known as thetans 
which have lived for thousands of years on other planets and were 
brought to Earth on a space ship that looks like a Douglas DC-8 plane.

Through a process called Dianetics they make themselves far better people, and even massively boost their IQ.

Such
claims however have never been proved and instead Scientology has faced
allegations it charges outrageous fees for its services and abuses its 
followers.

Among the 
most controversial aspects are 'audits' in which followers have to 
explain their inner secrets to a superior, including their sex lives.

There
have also been reports of bizarre punishments and questions have been 
raised over what happened to the wife of its current leader David 
Miscavige, who has reportedly not been seen since 2007.

Those
who join the higher order of Scientology, known as Sea Org, pledge 
their allegiance for one billion years - a vow supposedly made by 
children as young as 10.

Scientology
courts Hollywood stars and famous followers include Tom Cruise and John
Travolta but it is very rare that they speak about their beliefs.

Cruise's
marriage to Katie Holmes was said to have ended over her refusal to 
allow their six-year-old daughter Suri to be indoctrinated.

She
was also said to be concerned about the child being sent to the 
Scientology Gold Base in California where members are banned from having
children, are paid just $50 a week and can be punished for simply 
looking at somebody the wrong way.

Scientology was also the basis of the recent cinema hit The Master in which a 
drifter is taken in by the leader of a cult-like group.
