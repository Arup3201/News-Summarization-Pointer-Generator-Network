Eoin Morgan insisted he already has ‘the best group of players’ with him in Australia in an effort to end for good the almost daily saga of Kevin Pietersen attempting to keep his name in the England frame.

England’s new one-day captain again found himself answering questions about the exiled star when he arrived in Sydney for this morning’s resumption of hostilities with the old enemy.

England suffered problems in making the journey from Canberra when their flight was cancelled and then when they experienced turbulence on the replacement before Morgan was given a bumpy ride by the Australian press.

Pietersen said Morgan wanted him back in the England side in an excruciating ‘interview’ with Ricky Ponting during a Big Bash game when the former Australia captain took his opportunity to stir the English pot.

But, just as he did in Canberra on Sunday, Morgan insisted there was no way back for Pietersen when he spoke at the Sydney Cricket Ground before the first one-day international of a Tri-series that also involves India.

‘I think this is a good opportunity to clear things up given that Kevin has had a lot of opportunity to talk in the media and get his view out there,’ said Morgan. ‘I’m very happy with the group of players I have.

‘This is the best group of players we have to drive the England team forward over the next two months in particular. Kevin’s situation hasn’t changed over the last year. It’s been re-iterated over months and days.

‘It was reiterated by the chairman of selectors before Christmas and I’m reiterating it again just to clear it up. Thank you.’

Certainly Pietersen has done his friend no favours by putting him in a difficult position at a time when Morgan is trying to prepare for a challenging two months of one-day cricket.

And the Australians have loved keeping the issue in the spotlight. But if Ponting had wanted to do a proper interview, he might have asked Pietersen why he did not play alongside him with Surrey more often last summer if he truly was serious about playing international cricket again.

Morgan refused to answer when asked if England would be a stronger side here with Pietersen in it. ‘I think that’s a terrible question,’ said Morgan. ‘Kevin is not in the side, and won’t be for the foreseeable future, so there’s no point answering.’

The bottom line is that England have long since decided to move on without a player who became more trouble than he is worth.

And two half-centuries in an Australian Twenty20 event does not change that. If Pietersen wanted to help his friend as he tries to compete against the two best one-day sides in the world over the next two weeks and then the World Cup surely he would be better off keeping quiet. So will he go easy on Morgan now?

‘I’ve no idea and it really doesn’t bother me either way,’ insisted the Irishman. ‘We’ve always separated things on the field from things we’ve done off it and I’m very comfortable with that.’

Morgan believes England’s one-day batting line-up is now the most powerful he has known, as perhaps they began to show while scoring 364 and 391 in their two warm-up games in Canberra.

‘Certainly that’s the case in England teams I’ve played in,’ said the man who replaced Alastair Cook at the helm before this tour.

‘We saw in Canberra, and at various stages in the past year, that when we perform to our potential we are a dangerous side.’

And the man who might have been forced to go into this morning’s first one-day international without Jimmy Anderson as he is nursed back to full fitness is adamant there will be no psychological issues for England in returning to the scene of their 5-0 Ashes humiliation.

‘I think we have a reasonable record home and away against Australia in recent years,’ insisted Morgan.

‘The result in the one-day series here last year didn’t really reflect how we played. Brisbane and Adelaide in particular were games we would have won in the past, but the guys were low on confidence and we failed to get across the line.’
