Anniversaries are coming thick and fast for Adam Lallana. On Christmas Eve, he will celebrate a year’s marriage to his wife, Emily.

It is uncommon for a footballer to celebrate nuptials in the middle of a season but the reason Lallana chose that unique date is because of what happened last year: November 15, 2013 was the day he became an England international.

So much has happened to Lallana since winning his first cap against Chile 12 months ago – from his wedding to the World Cup to a £23.7million move to Liverpool – it has been difficult, at times, to digest but there is no suggestion he wants merely to sit back and reflect on what has gone.

His thoughts are focused on self-improvement; his ambitions are centred on making an impact for club and country and showing why he was prised away from Southampton for one of the biggest transfer fees of the summer.

There is much for Lallana to prove for Liverpool and England – after games against Slovenia and Scotland, the focus will turn to the Barclays Premier League and then the Champions League – but it is a challenge for which he is ready.

‘When you put it like that, yes, it has been a great year with everything that has gone on,’ said Lallana. ‘A lot of things have happened and it will take some going to beat it next year. That is what I am going to try to do. Hopefully we can win a trophy this season.

‘We all know results (for Liverpool) haven’t been to the level we want them to be – we have to just keep working hard. I can’t guarantee that results are going to change imminently, but I can assure you we are working hard for it to happen. I am enjoying it.

This time last year, Lallana made his international  debut for England against Chile at Wembley

‘We have got a nice couple of games coming up internationally, and we all know we are facing a big couple of Champions League games, plus we need to pick our form up in the league. I feel I am settling into the team nicely, albeit I want to up my contribution.’

That is now the big issue for Lallana. It is one thing thriving on the south coast, where the expectancy is less intense, but quite another to deliver in the goldfish bowl of Merseyside, where the pressure to deliver is unrelenting.

Stewart Downing, who has just reclaimed his place in the England squad, once spoke of life at Liverpool as being a ‘culture shock’ and Lallana recognises what the West Ham midfielder meant. The spotlight in the city is always on.

‘It is a big difference coming from Southampton,’ he said. ‘I was expecting that. It is something I’m learning to deal with and you just have to take it on board. The expectation is there, so you are expected to play better and more consistently.’

The same is true about England. Lallana, who grew up idolising Zinedine Zidane, could be classed as being a fixture in Roy Hodgson’s squad but, since that first run out against Chile, he has yet to establish himself as a regular starter.

His 11 appearances added up to 575 minutes but last month was a breakthrough, as he completed the full game against Estonia in Tallinn and is looking to build on that when Slovenia visit on Saturday; such fixtures might not capture the imagination of the public but Lallana sees it differently.

‘It is about knowing what is in store at the end (of the qualification programme),’ says Lallana. ‘We don’t play for England week in, week out so when we meet up we know what the job is and we do all the preparation we need to.

Lallana's first season at Anfield has already seen him face the might of Real Madrid in the Champions League

‘We are favourites to go through our group but we know we can’t get complacent, we have to respect every team we play. The minute you take your foot off the gas, there are teams out there who cause upsets.’

He will leave nothing to chance. Not on Saturday and certainly not next Tuesday, when hostilities are resumed across the border with Scotland. It will be a special night in Glasgow but Lallana is not sure it should become an annual occurrence.

‘Maybe it makes it special because it isn’t so regular,’ he says. ‘It makes it more interesting. Of course I understand it is a special fixture and everyone wants the bragging rights. It is a game we are looking forward to. The more competitive, the better.’
