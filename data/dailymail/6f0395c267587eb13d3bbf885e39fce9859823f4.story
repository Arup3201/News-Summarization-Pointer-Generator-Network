A police researcher who tipped off his drug dealer cousin about the location of suspected cannabis factories so their associates could raid the premises, has been jailed for three and a half years.

Matthew Garness, 30, informed David Chitolie, 27, 
about the location of two cannabis factories in Tottenham, North London,
which were later raided  by brothers Dwayne and Dean Edward.

Incredibly Garness was standing for election as a Labour 
councillor for Waltham Forest Council, pledging 'Safer Streets for 
Leyton', at the time of the offences.

Garness who worked at the Met's 
Quicksilver Patrol Base, in Wood Green, north London, accessed the 
forces CRIMINT and CRIS databases to obtain the information. and advised Chitolie on how to avoid detection.

Garness was finally was rumbled in a police sting when officers planted information about a Mercedes being left with £5,000  and two kilos of cannabis inside.

Jailing him for three years and five months Judge Deborah Taylor said: 'The seriousness of these offences is the nature and quantity of the information you supplied, the purposes for which it was supplied, and the effects of you supplying it.

'This was sustained and serious leaking of highly sensitive information to Chitolie which you knew was being and you had agreed to being used to identify and target cannabis factories.'

Turning to Chitolie, who was jailed for three years and nine months, Judge Taylor said he played a 'significant role' in encouraging his cousin to abuse his powers.

She said: 'You were not employed by the Metropolitan Police but you were of equal overall culpability.

'He was your cousin and you knew his job and knew where he was getting his information from.'

Southwark Crown Court heard how Garness was standing for election as a Labour councillor for Waltham Forest Council, pledging 'Safer Streets for Leyton', at the time of the offences

The court heard Garness accessed police intelligence records regarding Chitolie and his associates between January and November 2010.

Garness also passed on information about Imran Saleem, a serving soldier who had given Chitolie body armour and blank ammunition he brought back from Afghanistan.

Prosecutor David Durose told the court: 'The defendant Garness, an employee of the Metropolitan Police, provided sensitive police information to a group of criminals via his cousin, the defendant Chitolie, a dealer in cannabis, during 2010.

'As well as providing information which was of general interest to Chitolie, Garness also supplied the details of suspected cannabis factories, and on one particular occasion the location of a motor vehicle which Garness had been told contained cash and drugs.

'This vehicle was in fact part of a covert operation aimed at the network.

'Chitolie passed on information received from Garness to other conspirators, including in the later stages of the conspiracy Dean Edwards and his brother, Dwayne.

'These individuals sought to steal drugs, and on the one occasion cash, that they had been notified about.

'This information led to burglaries being committed on residential properties.

'These defendants were arrested in November 2010, having been subject to significant police surveillance for a period of weeks beforehand.

'This surveillance included video and audio footage of Garness' workplace, audio probe footage from within Garness' car, and regular audits of Garness' activity on the police computers, including via a piece of software known as 'Spectre' which, in effect, replicated Garness computer screen at another location.'

The barrister told the court that, ironically, on one occasion a bug in Garness' car captured him telling Chitolie how police tapped phone conversations and how to avoid being caught on tape.

Before he could be arrested he passed on details of two more suspected cannabis farms, including one text that read '95 Lawrence Road, N17. Factory or church who ting is green' after reading a Crimestoppers report filed by a member of the public.

Garness, of Homerton, east London, and Chitolie, of South Tottenham, north London, admitted conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office and conspiracy to steal.

Chitolie also pleaded guilty to possession of cannabis and conspiracy to supply cannabis.

Last year Dean Edwards of  Muswell Hill, admitted conspiracy to steal between January and November 2010 and was sentenced to four months behind bars suspended for 12 months and ordered to carry out 100 hours unpaid work.

Dwayne Edwards of Enfield, also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal between on November 9 and was handed a community order and told to complete 40 hours unpaid work.

Both men were ordered to pay £100 towards the cost of the case.
