Former England boss Fabio Capello says he will stay in his post as Russia coach despite the team's World Cup failure.

Russia were eliminated after the group stage in Brazil without winning a game, prompting speculation the Italian would be fired.

After emerging from his second meeting with Russian Football Union officials in three days, Capello told local media it was 'confirmed' that he 'will continue to work with the Russian team'.

Capello signed a contract extension in January taking him through to the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

That deal reportedly contains a clause that would require the Russian Football Union to pay out at least £15million in compensation for firing him at this stage.

The 68-year-old Capello has previously said the Russia job will be his last.
