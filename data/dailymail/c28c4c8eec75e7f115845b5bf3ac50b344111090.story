It's a race against time.

More than 200 people have been employed by Dutch surveying group Fugro to get the job done as quickly as possible.

They have a one-year deadline in which to find wreckage of the ill-fated Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, before they will be forced to move on by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB).

Fugro must follow the lead provided by the ATSB. Forming part of its contractual arrangements is that the current search site is to be analysed for a maximum of 12 months.

‘We know the time frame we have is about a year, after that we’ll be working in a new box as provided by the ATSB – they’re always refining their data and if they decide before that it (the plane wreckage) may be further south or north, they can order us to move at any time,' said Fugro Managing Director, Steve Duffield.

‘There’s certainly no time to waste.

‘We’ve got one year to search inside our designated box, if you like, before moving on.'

The images (below) of the search process which have been provided to Daily Mail Australia by Fugro, give a sense of what the Dutch team is up against.

The Fugro, which is 65 metres long, is highlighted by the small circle, dwarfed by the great expanses of the southern Indian Ocean. It has just returned to the area after a crew change.

In a setback for the operation, Mr Duffield said the sister ship, Furgo Discovery, has had to be diverted via West Africa and away from the Suez Canal 'because we were worried about pirates, even though we went through the process of hardening the boat'. That included placing barbed wire right about Discovery to try and prevent any potential hijacking.

It should arrive in mid-September, about 10 days later than expected.

'I’ve got guys visiting factories all around the world looking for the necessary equipment to make this a success,' Mr Duffield said.

Surveying crews are working against time to give a more accurate account of the sea-bed ahead of sensors being sent down. In some cases there will be a drop of 5000 metres but there are differences of up to 500 metres in some areas which need to be mapped before scanning equipment is sent down.

Using its advanced survey vessel, the Fugro Equator, fitted with state-of-the art multibeam echosounder equipment, Fugro is conducting a bathymetric survey of the search area. The seabed data obtained will assist in the production of maps of the seabed off Western Australia.

Fugro will spend more than $52 million in the next year in the search for MH370. 200 personnel will work on the project and are 'finding equipment from factories all around the world'

Mapping work continues in the area designated by the ATSB, as Fugro try to make the most of every possible minute.

‘They (the ATSB) have done most of the research and determined the suitable box in which we should operate,’ he said.

That ‘box’ he refers to is in fact 60,000 square kilometres of the southern Indian Ocean, an area approximately the size of Tasmania, 1600 kilometres off the West Australian coast.

‘We are looking for a debris field at the end of the day and we’re basing it on a lot of methodology from previous searches,’ Mr Duffield said.

Optimistically, he added that ‘we expect to see a debris field’.

‘We are also expecting, in a worst-case scenario, that we will see an engine because one of our proving tests shows that we can identify 2 metre by 2 metre cubed object.

‘We’ll run over our proving range and start mowing the lawn, so to speak. That's when we tow our sensors along the bottom.

'That's very difficult because of what is down there and part of why the Blue Fins were unsuccessful - it's very deep water we're working in and there are variances of up to 500 metres or more in some places.

‘But our expectations coupled with the data we have gathered to date, is that it is sitting proud somewhere on the sea-bed.

‘I’m not really sure how this will search will end up, it’s a massive area about the size of Tasmania and the engine you could equate to the size of two big blokes – not an easy task.’

The search operation will cost at least $52 million for the next 12 months.

Malaysia's Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai will travel to Australia next week to meet with the search team and Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss.

The Australian government has committed to spending up to $90 million on the MH370 search operation.

'We are working in conjunction with Malaysian government furnished assets,' Mr Duffield said.

Initial analysis of radar data and satellite communication messages following the disappearance of MH370 indicated it most likely crashed in the southern Indian Ocean, 2,500km south-west of Perth.

But despite an international search effort led by Australia and operated out of the Pearce Air Force base in Perth, no debris from the plane has been found.

Troubled carrier Malaysia Airlines is set to be de-listed and made private as part of a major restructure following the twin disasters of MH370 and MH17

The first phase of the search for the missing plane was a surface search of probable impact areas, conducted by an international fleet of aircraft and ships, which concluded on April 28.

An acoustic search, accompanied by a search of the ocean floor in the vicinity of the acoustic detentions was then conducted, also without success. The ocean floor search was completed on May 28.

As part of a major restructure, the Malaysian Government recently confirmed that the troubled airline will be de-listed and made private. Significant job losses are expected.

The overhaul comes after three unprofitable years and the double disasters of MH370 and MH17.
