Tory MP Michael Fabricant has clashed with Commons Speaker John Bercow

Commons Speaker John Bercow was facing further questions over his authority today after his own staff allegedly railed against him in an expletive-ridden phone call to a Tory MP.

Mr Bercow is under pressure over his attempt to parachute in controversial Australian Carol Mills to become Parliament’s most senior official.

But after a revolt by MPs the Speaker announced a ‘modest pause’ in the appointment process. Following Mr Bercow’s u-turn he has faced a series of challenges in the Commons.

Leading rebel Michael Fabricant revealed today that he had been egged on by Mr Bercow’s own Parliamentary staff.

He told the Spector magazine: ‘I have had so many messages of support from junior employees of the House saying go for it, the Speaker is a c***.’

The Tory MP added: ‘I don’t use language like that, but I do think he can be a bit of a knob. He doesn’t inspire loyalty at any level it seems.’

The remarks came after Mr Bercow rowed with Tory MPs in the Commons for a fourth day about the selection of Ms Mills.

In tense exchanges, Mr Fabricant said he had been told that head-hunters Saxton Bampfylde were stopped from meeting the panel and presenting information about Ms Mills, who was nominated by the Speaker as the replacement for recently retired Sir Robert Rogers.

The nomination, which must be confirmed by the Queen, has provoked a row about her qualifications to undertake the constitutionally sensitive role of head clerk advising the Speaker on matters of procedure in the House.

On a point of order to the Speaker, Mr Fabricant said: ‘Under those circumstances, I wonder whether you might wish to put the record straight so the House might not be misled?’

Mr Bercow gave a lengthy reply, insisting: ‘Let me reiterate: I believe you to be incorrect. The panel, of which I was chair, was briefed about all of the applicants for the post of clerk and chief executive and I think you are quite wrong to say there was prevention of SB giving information to the panel.

‘The panel made a judgment on the material with which it was provided, including a piece of information provided to it on the occasion of the second set of interviews. The panel made its own judgement on the basis of that information and did not see any need for a meeting.

‘I would also reiterate ... the individual, whose name you bandy around in the House, that of Carol Mills, was indeed on the original list of proposed interviewees. You put it to me that she had not been; I told you she had been - and I have one slight advantage of you in this matter.

‘That is, I was there and I do know, and you weren't and do not.’

Mr Bercow stopped Mr Fabricant from intervening again with a further point of order - despite the MP, who has had long feud with the Speaker, shouting from a seated position.

Mr Bercow added: ‘I hope you will be able to observe the normal courtesies that obtain in the House of Commons. That is the end of the matter for today.’

Tory Simon Burns however raised a further point of order, and questioned why Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle had been left off the selection panel.

He was replaced by Labour MP Margaret Hodge, whom Mr Burns suggested could have a potential conflict of interest because of her role as chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee.

But Mr Bercow said: ‘In the selection of panels that make judgments of this kind, it is perfectly normal practice to vary the membership of those panels from one instance to another - there is nothing disorderly, irregular or particularly surprising about that.

‘Secondly ... I thought when you raised the point (about Mrs Hodge) before it was a poor point and it hasn't improved with time. There is no conflict of interest at all.’

He added: ‘I think the House will agree I have set out the matters with crystal clarity. I have done so a number of times and I would hope people having had the point made to them a number of times would see it and acknowledge its veracity.’

The Speaker then clashed again with Mr Fabricant during a further point of order from Tory MP Julian Lewis, who spoke up in favour of Mr Bercow.

Mr Fabricant was accused of heckling and was told by Mr Bercow: ‘Try showing some basic courtesy and manners of the kind the people who attend our proceedings would wish to hear.

‘You made your point and it was decisively dealt with by the chair.’

Mr Bercow has called for the historic role of Commons clerk to be split, arguing that the traditional qualifications of the clerk do not match up to the needs of managing the large staff and budget of Parliament.

The £200,000-a-year role has always previously been held by one person, appointed by Letters Patent from the Queen to ensure independence and impartiality.
