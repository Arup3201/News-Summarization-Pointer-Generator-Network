Hero: Reginald Warneford single-handedly destroyed a Zeppelin and was awarded a VC but was left off a commemorative list because he was born in India

A First World War flying hero is to be honoured in his hometown - after a Government U-turn.

Whitehall chiefs had banned Royal Navy Sub Lieutenant Reginald ‘Rex’ Warneford from having his name immortalised with an honour plaque because he was born in India.

Rex was awarded the Victoria Cross aged just 23 when he became the first person to destroy a Zeppelin airship planning to bomb London.

Over Belgium in 1915 he hit the German airship LZ-37 with a bomb sending it down in flames.

It was expected that his name would lie alongside that of fellow VC hero submariner Lt Richard Sandford in their home town of Exmouth in east Devon.

The stones are part of a Government plan to mark the 100th anniversary of the start of WW1 by laying plaques in the birthplaces of VC heroes.

But then they ruled that only those born in Britain would be honoured and Rex was born in India and did not move to Exmouth until he was thirteen years old.

There was an outcry over the exclusion of Rex and other foreign-born VC winners.

But now Communities minister Baroness Warsi said: 'There are a number of VC recipients who may have been born in India like Sub Lt Reginald ‘Rex’ Warneford that have local ties.

'In cases like this we are happy to provide (East Devon Council) with a commemorative paving stone.'

Rex’s nephew James Corkery said: 'We are delighted the Government has changed its mind. Exmouth was the only home Rex knew.'

The Government plans to commemorate every British-born Great War VC winner. Rex's hometown honours his memory (right) - now the Goverment is set to do the same

Plans are now being made to unveil the tribute stones in the town’s Phear Park in the spring.

Barbara Gilbert, archivist for the Fleet Air Arm Museum where Rex's VC is held, said eastern England had 'lived in fear' of the devastating Zeppelin bombing raids.

'Overnight, Warneford became a national hero and gave us hope,' said Mrs Gilbert.

'Killed in a crash only two weeks later, his death led to national mourning.

'Some 99 years on, it is fitting that we should remember him.'

Sub-Lt Warneford was born on October 15, 1891, in Darjeeling in the foothills of the Himalayas, where his parents served in the colonial service at the height of the British Empire.

He had completed a dozen solo flights when on June 7, 1915, he was ordered to join a four-plane midnight attack on the Zeppelin sheds at Bercham in occupied Belgium.

Sub Lt Warneford had never flown in the dark before and quickly lost his fellow pilots.

Flying a tiny single-seater Morane Parasol, mostly made from just wood and canvas, he came across airship LZ-37 airship cruising at 7,000ft.

The massive bomber was kept airborne by 953,000 cubic feet of highly flammable hydrogen.

Rex was armed with just a revolver, a carbine, and six 20-pound bombs.

He spotted the airship at Ostend and he followed it for 50 minutes over Bruges before Warneford shot at it.

After the Zeppelin dropped to 7,000ft, Warneford was able to climb above it and dropped his bombs, which ripped the airship apart.

Warneford's plane was enveloped in flames and he crash-landed 35 miles behind German lines.

He found only his fuel line was broken and fixed the problem with a cigarette holder before coolly flying home.

By the time he returned to base at 10.30am the next day, his exploits were being celebrated across the empire.

King George V awarded Rex the Victoria Cross that day, while France followed up with its prestigious Legion of Honour.

He won worldwide fame for becoming the first pilot to shoot down a feared Zeppelin.

But he was killed 10 days later after he returned from France after collecting the award in a new biplane that bucked moments after take-off and the pilot was thrown out and killed.
