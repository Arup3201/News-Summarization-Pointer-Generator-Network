This shocking photo shows a U.S. Marines team posing in
front of a Nazi SS flag in Afghanistan.

The Marine Corps today confirmed one of its scout sniper
teams posed in front of the notorious flag in September 2010 in Sangin province
but insisted the issue has since been addressed internally.

Former Marines have been left outraged by the picture and are
calling for a full investigation, but military officials say they have already
probed the photo and confirmed it was not racially-motivated.

Outrage: The Marine Corps today confirmed one of its scout sniper teams posed in front of the notorious flag in September 2010 in Sangin province but insisted the issue has since been addressed internally

‘Heads need to roll and this needs to be fully investigated,’
said Mikey Weinstein, of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation in
Washington D.C. ‘This is a complete and total outrage.’

The photo shows a flag with what appear to be the letters 'SS' in the shape of jagged lightning bolts. The symbol resembles that used by SS units in World War Two.

Use of the SS symbol is not acceptable, and the issue has
been looked into by the Marines, Lt Col Stewart Upton said. The Marines are no
longer with the unit they were assigned to at the time.

Mr Weinstein said he has been flooded with calls from former
Marines offended by the photo and from one member of his group who is a survivor
of the concentration camp in Auschwitz, Poland.

Criminal organisation the SS, or 
Schutzstaffel, was the police and military force of the Nazi Party, 
which was distinct from the general army. Members pledged an oath of 
loyalty to Adolf Hitler.

SS units were held responsible for many war crimes and played an 
integral role in the extermination of millions of Jews along with 
gypsies and other people classed as undesirables.

Mistake: A military probe found the SS symbol was meant to identify the Marines as scout snipers, not Nazis

Historical context: The SS was the police and military force of the Nazi Party and it was distinct from the general army. Members pledged an oath of loyalty to Adolf Hitler, pictured right in 1939

Mr Weinstein said his organisation was sending a letter to
the head of the Marine Corps and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta.

Master Gunnery Sergeant Mark Oliva, a spokesman at Camp
Pendleton, California, said the photo was brought to the attention of the 1 Marine
Expeditionary Force inspector general in November.

He found there was no intent on the part of the Marines to
identify themselves with a racist group and the probe found the SS symbol was
meant to identify the Marines as scout snipers, not Nazis.

But Sergeant Oliva added that it was nonetheless not
acceptable. This is the second time this year the Marine Corps has had to do
damage control for actions of its troops.

The Marine Corps is currently investigating a group of
Marines recorded on video urinating on the dead bodies of Taliban fighters.
Those Marines were based at Camp Lejune, North Carolina.
