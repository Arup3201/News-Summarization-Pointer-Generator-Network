A naturally occurring hormone can be used to stop the ‘high’ produced by cannabis, research has shown.

The discovery could lead to new approaches to treating cannabis intoxication and dependence.

It may also assist in the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes while blocking its psychoactive effects.

A naturally occurring hormone called pregnenolone  can be used to stop the 'high' produced by cannabis and the discovery could lead to new approaches to treating cannabis intoxication and dependence, according to new research

Pregnenolone is a hormone that is found in our bodies and can be made in the lab.

the chemical is used for fatigue and increasing energy, Alzheimer’s disease and enhancing memory, trauma and injuries, as well as stress and improving immunity.

It is also is used for skin disorders including psoriasis.

In the body, pregnenolone is used to make all steroid hormones.

Because of this, it was studied studied for stress, fatigue, and arthritis in the 1940s before lab-made hormones became available.

Researchers found that the steroid 
hormone pregnenolone reduces the brain's sensitivity to THC, which is 
the chief high-inducing compound in cannabis.

Scientists led by Dr Monique Vallee, from the University of Bordeaux in France, studied mice and rats to see how recreational drugs such as cocaine, alcohol and cannabis affected the production of steroids in the brain involved in nerve function.

They found that THC triggered a dramatic spike in pregnenolone through activation of the cannabinoid receptor (CB-1) - a molecule that facilitates cannabis stimulation.

This in turn had a ‘negative feedback’ effect leading to a blunting of THC activity, reducing the ‘high’ from the drug.

‘This new understanding of the role of pregnenolone has the potential to generate new therapies for the treatment of cannabis dependence,’ the scientists said.

The findings, published in the journal Science, follow the decision to legalise the recreational use of cannabis in the U.S. state of Colorado.

Yesterday saw the legalisation of recreational sales of marijuana in Colorado, where customers queued to buy an ounce (28.3g) of legal cannabis.

Possession, cultivation and private consumption of marijuana has been legal in the state since November 2012 but the sale of the drug from shops marks a turning point.

Colorado has set up a plant-tracking system in a bid to prevent the drug from entering the black market, and regulators have set up packaging, labelling and testing requirements.

In December, Uruguay became the first country to to make it legal to grow, sell and consume marijuana.

The law allowing registered Uruguayans over 18 to buy up to 40g (1,4oz) of the drug a month is expected to come into force in April and the government hopes it will weaken tackle drug cartels.

A recent study found teenagers who use cannabis regularly risk damaging their memory as structures in their brains appeared to shrink and collapse inward, possibly reflecting a decrease in neurons

However, while some people believe the legalisation of the drug will cut criminal activity surrounding it, others believe it will expose more people to drugs, which have been linked to health issues.

A recent study found teenagers who use cannabis regularly risk damaging their memory, which can lead to poor academic performance.

They believe the brain abnormalities last for ‘at least a few years’ after users have stopped taking the drug.

The researchers also said there was fresh evidence the habit may cause mental health problems in youngsters predisposed to schizophrenia.

Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug among adolescents in the UK, with more than four in ten admitting having taken it.

Almost 100 teenagers took part in the U.S. research examining the effects of cannabis deep in the brain.

It found teenagers who smoked it daily for about three years had abnormal changes in the brain structures related to remembering and processing information and they performed poorly on memory tasks.

The brain abnormalities and memory problems were found on MRI scans when study participants were in their early twenties – two years after they had stopped smoking the drug.

Memory-related structures in their brains appeared to shrink and collapse inward and the researchers from Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, said such damage was linked to poor academic performance and everyday functioning.
