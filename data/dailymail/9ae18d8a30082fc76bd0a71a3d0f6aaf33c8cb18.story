The weekly supermarket shop can be a perplexing chore – so much so, say experts, that we are missing out on bargains.

Shoppers pushing trolleys through the aisles are confronted with so many competing posters and signs that they cannot take them all in, according to behaviour analysts.

As a result, the subconscious takes over and we tend to fill our trolleys with items regardless of whether or not they are good value.

Bombarded by offers: All the half price signs in a Tesco supermarket. But research has revealed our brain cannot take in all the offers

A study cites the example of DVDs priced at £4.24 each that suddenly saw an increase in sales when a sign appeared promoting them at ‘Two for £10’. Similarly, sales of a big brand lager placed under a prominent sign soared by 10 per cent compared with rival brands on the same aisle.

The brain of the shoppers apparently registered the sign as evidence that the lager was on special offer when, in fact, it simply read: ‘Thieves will be prosecuted.’

And while supermarkets routinely use so-called BOGOF deals – buy one, get one free – to tempt customers, researchers say it appears that many people are immune to them.

Despite a BOGOF deal on teabags, nearly half of shoppers simply bought just one box, rather than picking up the second free one. BOGOFs on baked beans and cheese got a similar reaction. Phillip Adcock, managing director of behaviour analysts SBXL, said the research suggests people are influenced by the fact that a product is being promoted, but are less likely to take in the detail.

SBXL sends teams of researchers into stores to monitor real life  evidence of how people shop.

Mr Adcock said: ‘Our brains just cannot cope with the number of decisions we have to make in a store. We will see a different offer every three-quarters of a second in a supermarket and we just can’t cope.

‘If you are faced with 85 different types of lager in an aisle, the brain just automatically tries to slim that down to a smaller number.

‘If there are four or five on special offer, the brain will use that as a  reference for a bargain. It is not something you consciously notice.’

‘In a number of studies we have carried out, it is clear that the precise nature of a special offer or deal was much less important than the presentation of the promotion.

‘Shoppers are unable to make detailed calculations in-store and so they take shortcuts or start to guess. What they actually do is reduce their choice to anything that stands out above the rest.’

Mr Adcock said: ‘The message to shoppers is to take more time taking  in the detail of a promotion in  order to understand what the saving is – if any.

‘The message to supermarkets is that it doesn’t really matter what the offer is as long as the product is  visually prominent.’
