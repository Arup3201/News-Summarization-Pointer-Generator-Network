A Christian doctor yesterday claimed he was a victim of religious discrimination after being disciplined for discussing his faith with a suicidal patient.

Richard Scott, 51, a former medical missionary, was reprimanded despite the 24-year-old complainant not even having to turn up to give evidence.

Instead, he was allowed to give his version of events over the telephone and behind closed doors against the Cambridge-educated GP.

Dr Richard Scott said he was 'disgusted' with the ruling and
said that if this was a matter regarding a Muslim or person living by spiritual practice Reiki, they would not be in his position

Dr Scott told a disciplinary panel he offered the troubled patient spiritual guidance after first checking that he did not mind.

But the man’s mother complained ten days later about the consultation at his practice in Margate, Kent.

She said her son was told he would 
‘suffer’ and be ‘haunted by the devil’ if he did not turn ‘towards 
Jesus’ from his faith, which has not been revealed.

Yesterday, the General Medical Council ruled against the married father-of-three in favour of the man known as Patient A.

It imposed an official warning and 
told the GP that any repetition could lead to tougher action, 
potentially resulting in being struck off.

The hearing was stayed last year 
after Patient A refused to attend a disciplinary panel in Manchester. It
went ahead this week when he was allowed to testify by phone and in 
secret.

This was described by Dr Scott, who is
currently unable to work as he fights cancer, as an ‘outrageous’ denial
of a fair trial. He was supported by Andrea Williams, of the Christian 
Legal Centre, which had backed his case.

‘Our society seems to be becoming more
repressive, with ordinary, decent people being disciplined just for 
expressing their Christian beliefs,’ she said.

Dr Scott added: ‘I’m yet another Christian being slammed for approaching their faith at work.

‘The panel has chosen to believe a 
patient with massive and multiple problems against a doctor of 28 years’
standing.’ He declared: ‘I will continue to raise the issue of faith 
where relevant because it’s for the patient’s benefit.’

The case started in August 2010 when 
Patient A saw Dr Scott at Bethesda Medical Practice, which states that 
all its doctors are practising Christians.

The GP claimed he made a ‘gentle offer’ to broach the subject of faith and the man replied: ‘Go for it’.

But the GP said the patient quickly ‘cut up rough’ and told him it was ‘a load of b******s’.

Last night, the former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey said: ‘I’m extremely saddened by this ruling.

‘Many Christians will be asking whether they any longer have the freedom to express their faith.

‘I urge them to continue to do so in the manner of Dr Scott, with respect for others and compassion for all.’

Dr Peter Saunders, chief executive of the Christian Medical Fellowship, accused the GMC of succumbing to ‘militant secularism’.

He added: ‘Good doctors do not treat 
their patients solely as biological or biochemical machines but practise
“whole person” medicine.’

Last night, GMC chief executive Niall 
Dickson said: ‘This is not about religion. It is about respecting 
patients and making sure doctors do not use the incredibly privileged 
position they hold to push their own beliefs.’

Other Christian medical staff have 
also lost cases over their faith, including a nurse in a row over 
wearing her crucifix on duty and a doctor stopped from advising on 
adoption as she refused to endorse gay couples.
