A Scottish livestock farmer has become an overnight literary sensation after selling more than 50,000 copies of his first detective novel in a month.

James Oswald, 45, wrote Natural Causes, a crime thriller starring Detective Inspector McLean, while tending to his 350 cows and sheep at his farm in the Fife countryside.

The tale, which centres around a series of brutal deaths in Edinburgh may not sound ground-breaking, but a combination of creative flair and clever marketing skills have helped make it a bestseller. 

Ploughing on: Livestock farmer James Oswald has become an overnight literary sensation with the success of his detective novel, Natural Causes, which he wrote while tending to his Highland cattle and New Zealand sheep

Into a new field:  A combination of creative flair and clever marketing has made Natural Causes an overnight success

At first James offered the novel on Amazon for free, but asked readers to pay £2.99 for the follow-up The Book of Souls.

Sparkling debut: James Oswald's novel Natural Causes is a crime thriller set in Edinburgh

Within a month his debut had shifted 50,000 copies. It soared to the top of the Kindle bestsellers list where it remains in the top 10.

Now James has been signed up by publishers Penguin for a three-book deal worth £150,000.

Natural Causes is on the shelves in Waterstones and Tesco and has even been endorsed by Richard and Judy's Book Club.

'The last month has been a whirlwind,' James told MailOnline.

'I'm still trying to catch my breath.
 This has all happened incredibly quickly. I only self-published the 
book about a year ago and I signed with Penguin in last October.

'Friends have been tweeting me saying the book has already sold out in some shops.'

But there are no signs he will be giving up his day job - with his first advance, the amateur writer splashed out on a new tractor.

James' overnight success has drawn comparisons with the meteoric rise of E.L.James and her Fifty Shades of Gray series.

In
 fact, he has been writing all his life, starting with comic strip books
 while he was a psychology student at Aberdeen University.

But
 his efforts to replicate the dark, mystical workings of heroes Iain 
Banks and Neil Gaiman failed to attract the attention of publishers.

When James inherited his farm from his parents David and Juliet in 2008 after they died in a car accident from 2008, he became even more determined to make his writing a success.

'My father had semi-retired and I was thinking I would come to it eventually,' he told MailOnline.

Hard days night: James juggles tending to his sheep and cattle with writing in the evening

'But it has been rather harder work than I expected. I love writing - I would have carried on writing for years even if it had only been myself reading.

'I do a lot of thinking when I'm out in my tractor, or when I'm sitting in the lambing pens. I do the farm work that needs to be done in the daytime and then do my writing in the evening till about midnight. It is pretty tiring.'

If his literary career continues to bring rich rewards he hopes to complete a three-bedroom house with partner Barbara and expand his flock of New Zealand sheep and Highland cattle.

'I would love to write more. I have a lot more ideas,' he added.
