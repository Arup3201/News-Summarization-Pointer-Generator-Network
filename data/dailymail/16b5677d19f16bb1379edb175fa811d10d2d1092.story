Authorities are investigating whether Jesse Matthew was involved in up to 10 crimes against women in Virginia, after the 31-year-old was arrested under suspicion of kidnapping still-missing college student Hannah Graham.  

Matthew was arrested in Texas last week after fleeing Virginia when police tried to question him in the disappearance of the 19-year-old University of Virginia student. The UVA nurses's assistant was the last person seen with Graham the night she went missing from downtown Charlottesville.  

Now investigators are looking into Matthew's movements over the last 12 years, focusing in on the more than six months he attended Christopher Newport University when two other young women disappeared without a trace.

Matthew transferred to the Newport News school after being kicked out of Liberty University in Lynchburg in 2002 following allegations of rape. 

He attended CNU from January 2003 before dropping out the following October. During that time, two local women went missing and were never found again. 

Autumn Wind Day, 24, was last seen shopping at the Food Lion grocery store two miles from campus when she disappeared on July 24, 2003.

Less than two months later, 31-year-old Sophie May Rivera went missing after leaving her home located seven miles from CNU. Matthew left the CNU football team five days after Rivera vanished, and dropped out of school a month later. 

Two more victims? Sophie May Rivera (left) and Autumn Wind Day (right) both went missing from Newport News, Virginia when Matthew was attending local college Christopher Newport University in 2003. Authorities there say they are reopening both cold cases. Neither woman was ever found

Local police are now reopening the two cold cases to see if Matthew may have been involved.

'While there are no indications that Jesse Matthew is connected to these two cases, both will be reviewed,' Newport News police spokesman Lou Thurston told WAVY. 

It's uncertain what Matthew did for the next several years. However, new forensic evidence connects him to the high-profile abduction, rape and murder of 20-year-old Morgan Harrington. 

Filling in the blanks: Matthew used to work as a taxi driver and a source told MailOnline that he used to give girls free rides. It's uncertain what he did between dropping out of CNU in 2003, and picking up his career as a cabbie in 2010

Big break: Police said on Monday that there is a forensic link between the rape and murder of Morgan Harrington, 20 (left), in 2009 and the disappearance of Hannah Graham, 18 on September 13. Police are also looking into whether Matthew may have played a role in the murder of 23-year-old Cassandra Morton (right), who went missing around the same time as Morgan Harrington

Morgan disappeared in 2009 and her body was found three months later, hidden at a remote farm. DNA evidence of her killer, found on her remains, has since been linked to a 2005 rape case of a Fairfax woman who survived the attack.

Eight years after dropping out of CNU, Matthew reappears in 2010 working as a taxi driver in Charlottesville. Two years later he got a position as a nurse's assistant at UVA Medical Cenewhere he was just recently fired following Graham's disappearance.

In that time, he may have played a role in the death of Morgan, and also another local woman who went missing around the same time - 23-year-old Lynchburg resident Cassandra Morton. 

Morton's decomposing body was found in November 2009 and the homicide remains unsolved.

Authorities in Montgomery County Virginia are also reopening the double homicide of couple Heidi Childs and David Metzler, who were found shot dead in a campground near the Virginia Tech campus in August 2009. 

'Our investigators will certainly follow up and look at the facts surrounding the Hannah Graham case to see if there is a connection. However, at this time we have nothing to lead us to believe that there is a connection,' Capt. Brian Wright told ABC News.

And three additional women went missing from Charlottesville around the same time Matthew moved there. 

Samantha Ann Clarke, 19, disappeared from Orange county in September 2010 and 19-year-old DaShad Laquinn Smith disappeared near there in November 2012, WUSA-TV reported.

Alexis Murphy, 17, disappeared after leaving her home in Shipman, Virginia, in August 2013. This May, Randolph Taylor, 48, was convicted of her abduction and murder in January although her body has never been found.

Another two young women, Alicia Showalter Reynolds, 25, and Anne Carolyn McDaniel, 20, were abducted and murdered in 1996 along the same Virginia corridor. 

Gone: Alexis Murphy, 17, is one of three women who went missing around the time Matthew returned to Charlottesville. She disappeared after leaving her home in Shipman, Virginia, in August 2013
