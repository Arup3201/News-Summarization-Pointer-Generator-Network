The woman whose unthinkable loss of her two children was one of the most tragic stories to come from Superstorm Sandy has spoken out about one year after her ordeal.

Glenda Moore, 40, was a Staten Island mother of two before the relentless storm surge took away her boys Connor, 4, and Brandon, 2.

Now she's trying to pick up the pieces amid the painful memories stirred by the anniversary of the hurricane.

Staying strong: A year after the storm, a woman whose 2 and 4-year-old sons were killed by Hurricane Sandy has spoken out about her ordeal

Tragic: 2-year-old Brandon and 4-year-old Connor Moore, were sucked into the swirling floodwaters as their mother, Glenda Moore, tried to escape her SUV

Moore's nightmare began a year ago when she was driven from her home in the hard hit New York City borough of Staten Island.

As her Ford Explorer stalled on the Father Capodanno Boulevard in South Beach, she got out of the vehicle and freed both boys from their seat belts.

She grabbed them and put one under each arm - but lost her grip as a huge wave pounded over their heads.

'It's been a tough week, it's been a year since we lost the boys,' Moore told WABC in an exclusive interview Monday.

The search continued for days, with numerous emergency personnel joining the march through Staten Island marshland.

The bodies were found about 100 feet from each other at the end of a narrow dead end street.

'Every minute, pretty much all we do is think about them,' Moore said Monday.

She
 and her husband have moved to Brooklyn to be near family in the year 
since the storm and she and husband Damian are looking for a new home in
 the Marine Park area and want to start a new family.

But in the meantime, she said: 'I couldnâ€™t spend another night at that house.'

After
 the boys disappeared, police said, Moore fled and in a panic climbed 
fences and went door-to-door looking in vain for help in a neighborhood 
that was presumably largely abandoned in the face of the storm.

While their home remains painfully quiet for now, Moore, who is a nurse, said work has been what's kept her positive.

'At least we're busy during the day,' she said.

Moore tries to stay upbeat but says its still very hard. 'Every minute, pretty much all we do is think about them,' she said
