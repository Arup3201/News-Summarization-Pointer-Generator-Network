Television celebrity Tamara Beckwith-Veroni was fined £900 yesterday for not saying who was behind the wheel of her powerful white Porsche when it was snapped speeding.

The 44 year-old, who married construction heir Giorgio Veroni in Venice in 2007 and has appeared on TV shows including Loose Women, Come Dine With Me, Dancing on Ice and Four Rooms, insists she was not driving.

Beckwith-Veroni did not appear at Lavender Hill Magistrates Court, but pleaded guilty via a letter to failing to give police information relating to the identification of the driver.

The court heard the registered keeper of the 3.0 litre vehicle, Beckwith-Veroni, was contacted by the police who wanted to know who was driving it, but received no response.

No details of where the original offence took place or the speed of the Porsche were given, but the court was told Beckwith-Veroni does have three points on her driver's licence for speeding.

In her letter, read out in court, the former It girl said: 'I wrote a letter on July 1 asking for further information.'

'I was seven months pregnant, I was unclear who drove the car and a girlfriend visiting me was adamant she was not driving in the area.

'I find it hard to understand how I can be of more help. The car is mine and as a law-abiding citizen I'm resigned to stepping up and taking responsibility for my car.'

She added: 'I'm not a speedy driver, I'm a mother of three and continuously think of that when at the wheel.'

The magistrates also endorsed Beckwith-Veroni's licence with six penalty points and ordered her to pay £85 costs and a £90 victim surcharge.
