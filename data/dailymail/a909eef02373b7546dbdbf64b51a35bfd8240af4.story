Some may associate raves with drunken revelry, late nights, and heavy drugs.

A sober morning dance party called Daybreaker, which had their end of year event on December 18 on a boat circulating New York, ditches the booze for coffee and granola bars and promotes a holistic start to a busy work day.

Hundreds of professionals of all ages flocked to lower Manhattan last month  to board the Hornblower Infinity at Pier 40 to listen  to groovy beats by DJ Scumfrog and watch the sunrise.

Sober dance party: Hundreds of New York professionals boarded a boat circulating Manhattan for the Daybreaker event to dance in the wee hours before going to work  

All aboard: The Hornblower Infinity left  from Pier 40 in Manhattan for a sunrise dance cruise around the city for the latest Daybreaker event

Can't stop, won't stop: These driven individuals are so dedicated to dance that they got up early before work to sweat it out and get a killer workout 

All hail dance: Despite not having any drugs or alcohol the energy in the room was intoxicating and party goers were high on life and dance moves 

Live musicians on board played the saxophone and singers and drummers chimed in to create a collective tune.

Rather than hit the gym at 6:30 a.m. participants dressed in workout gear, business suits, and wild costumes flooded the dance floor until 10:00 a.m. to dance for the sake of dancing all before heading into the office.

Some party goers were even dressed as Santa Claus to celebrate Christmas and the new year.

Tickets cost around $35 per person but all coffee, food, and juices were included in the fare.

A portion of all ticket proceeds from the event were donated to Urban Arts Partnership to support arts education and youth empowerment programs at low-income schools across the city.

Other Daybreaker parties have been hosted at various nightclubs turned dayclubs around New York and Brooklyn.

The 'morning movement' as it is described on Daybreaker's Facebook page is popular among tech executives as it's founded by General Assembly co-founder Matthew Brimer and Super Sprowtz founder and CEO Radha Agrawal.

Nice view!: The boat circulated Manhattan and the attendees got to watch the sunrise over the city that never stops dancing, even at 6 a.m. 

Morning meditation: Dancers took a small break to listen to a morning meditation and affirmation and learn about the health benefits of dancing sober 

Celebrity appearance: Santa Claus decided to join in the dance party before a long day of checking his list twice and preparing to deliver Christmas presents 

Hearts in their eyes: The founders of Daybreaker aimed to create a creative community for people to socialize, network, and build off of each other's ideas 

the love boat: Attendees dressed in costumes, business attire, and nautical themed garb joined together to dance and make new friends, or even business partners 

'It's a great way to start the day off with a bang, and without alcohol,' Brimer said to Business Insider after a Daybreaker party this summer.

'It's very much a workout.'

The latest Daybreaker dance event set aside a bit of time for a morning meditation and affirmation in addition to the hours of dancing.

One member of the Daybreaker team took a moment to speak about the effect of sober dancing on the brain and explained that the body releases endorphins which both promote energy and immune health.

He noted that the positive effects of dancing are only prevalent when the body is not ingesting substances like booze and drugs.

More than a health driven dance party, Daybreaker is a networking hotspot for likeminded creatives to collaborate and feed off of each other’s positive energy, say the founders.

Energizing morning: Dancers break a sweat as the music thumps through the bright and cozy party ship 

The decks on deck: DJ Scumfrog plays groovy and energizing tunes to jump start the morning 

'What's exciting about Daybreaker is that it fosters this community where entrepreneurs can be creative,' Brimer said.

'So there's the physical aspect, but also the social energy, open-minded, and artistic side to it.'

In one corner of the boat, a haiku station was set up in which partygoers could have a poem written for them on the spot.

The event founders apparently came up with the idea for the party over a late-night falafel meal in Williamsburg back in 2013.

'Over a late-night falafel in Williamsburg a few months back, we mused over an idea. An idea about dancing before the day broke with people we love. About cultivating a community that values camaraderie, self-expression, wellness, immediacy… and mischief. About going to work with our brows slightly dewed from moving our bodies with reckless abandon, sans alcohol but with so much spirit, surrounded by the most amazing people we know,' says their Facebook page.

According to Daybreaker's website as they expand they plan to host events in cities all over the world and those who wish to remain in the loop can do so here.

reading an affirmation: participants were handed a reading on a piece of paper and took a moment to set goals and intentions for the day and the new year 

Dancers: Daybreaker hired dancers and live musicians to keep the energy moving throughout the room 

New York groove: The boat passed some famous sites in New York City such as the Statue of Liberty
