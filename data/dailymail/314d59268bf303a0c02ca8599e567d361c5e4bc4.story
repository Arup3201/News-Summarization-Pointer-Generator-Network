Â An emergency evacuation of a residential area of London was carried out today after a large house fire started dangerously close to a petrol station.

Firefighters sealed off the area around the blaze in Ickenham, Middlesex, due to concerns it could spread to a nearby Shell garage.

Eye-witnesses took dramatic pictures 
of the flames which engulfed the garage of the house and caused damaged 
to the ground floor of the property.

Emergency services battled to control a blaze involving a house and a garage next to a petrol station in Ickenham, Middlesex .

Crews from from Ruislip, Southall, 
Northolt, Harrow, and Hillingdon fire stations attended the blaze at 12.15pm.

The area around the petrol station was sealed off for nearly two hours while the firefighters battled to control the blaze.

Nobody was injured as a result of the fire but the cause of the blaze is under investigation.

The fire in Ickenham was the second major incident in the Middlesex area that police had been called out to deal with in 24 hours after a mother and her two young children were found dead at a house in west Ruislip.

Tributes were left at the house to the woman, aged 34, and her two 'lovely girls', named as Prisha, aged four, and Jasmine, aged nine, whose bodies were found on Friday.

Paramedics were called to the semi-detatched property but were unable to help the young family.

An inquest into the deaths is expected to be opened and adjourned next week. The family's next of kin have been informed.

A total of 35 firefighters rushed to deal with the blaze in Ickenham shortly after noon today
