Two-time Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain is considered to be one of the most versatile actresses in Hollywood and has had her pick of what many would consider to be dream roles.

But when it came to signing up for her latest film project - mobster movie A Most Violent Year - the 39-year-old has revealed that she approached the role with a rather unique mindset.

'I wanted to play [politician] Dick Cheney,' she told Yahoo Style about the movie, which sees her stepping into the shoes of Anna Morales, the wife of an immigrant who sets out to build up his own business in New York in the 1980s.

Dark side: Jessica Chastain couldn't wait for the opportunity to play an 'unpopular' character 

Chemistry: Jessica and her co-star Oscar Isaac have known each other since studying at Julliard School 

Casting call: The 39-year-old actress suggested to director JC Chandor that he audition Oscar for the role

In other words, the actress was eager to sink her teeth into a role that would give her a chance to explore the complexities of being perceived as the bad guy, which is the way that many people have portrayed former Vice President Mr Cheney - a vocal supporter of the CIA's use of torture during America's war against terrorism.

And unlike her previous roles, which have, more often than not, seen her working for the good guy, her latest starring part enabled her to experiment with a much darker side, as her character struggles to support her husband in his pursuit of the American Dream. 

'She has more authority [than Kay in The Godfather],' Jessica says of Anna, comparing her to the central matriarch in infamous gangster movie The Godfather. 

'She knows what she is doing. She knows she's cooking the books.'

When it came to finding the perfect co-star, Jessica also exercised a fair amount of her own authority, immediately suggesting to director JC Chandor that he think about casting her fellow Julliard School graduate Oscar Isaac in the role. 

'We had never acted together in school - he was a few years behind me,' she explained. 'But I always wanted to do something with him.'

Star quality: Both Oscar and Jessica have received numerous awards nods for their roles in A Most Violent Year

'Sheer evil': For her next part, Jessica will take on the role of a tabloid editor who tries to take down a Hollywood star

'She knows what she is doing': Jessica explained that her character in A Most Violent Year shows a sense of real authority throughout the film 

Both actors have already earned plenty of award nominations for their roles in the gangster flick; The National Board of Review named it the best film and Oscar as the best actor, while Jessica was given a Golden Globe nomination for best supporting actress.

And as for Jessica's eagerness to play the unpopular characters, the movie has done little to dull her enthusiasm. 

In fact, the Zero Dark Thirty star has already signed up to play yet another villain, this time in director Xavier Dolan's The Death and Life of John F. Donovan, in which she will take on the role of a tabloid editor who attempts to 'take down' Hollywood's golden boy, played by Kit Harrington.

'We're going to have so much fun doing this,' the director told movie news website Thompson on Hollywood. 

'She's a mega tricky villain. Like full-on b***h. I'm a fan of what she does and I can see all that she can do, but she has not played this part. It's a very specific part. It's sheer evil.'
