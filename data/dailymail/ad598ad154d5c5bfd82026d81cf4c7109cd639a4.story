For anyone who has ever wondered what is was like to be a musician, a new website has the answer.

Musician Beck worked with director Chris Milk to create a groundbreaking new interactive site to let viewers see and hear a gig from his point of view.

The Hello, Again site lets you move your point of view so it feels as if you are standing anywhere in the room - whether it's among the crowd, next to the band or even up on stage with Beck.

And thanks to a bank of specially designed microphones that were dotted around the venue, you hear the music in 3D surround sound, so it comes at you from the direction of the performers.

By using their more or even a webcam to move the point of view, viewers can see and hearwhat it really feels like to be on stage at a Beck gig

Organisers created a special 260 stage for the song, with Beck in the middle while 160 musicians are around the perimeter of the Los Angeles studio

The special gig was funded by car maker Lincoln as part of an advertising campaign.

'Musicians have been covering, remaking, and remixing classic songs for as long as we’ve been listening,' it said.

'Yet what Beck is doing with David Bowie’s 1977 classic, Sound And Vision, is something well beyond a cover,' the organisers claim.

Over 160 musicians took part in the recording, including an orchestra, a drum line, a row of electric guitarists, a musical saw, modular synthesizers, a Theremin player, a yodeler, 2 different choirs, a harpist, a range of percussionists from around the world, and the Dap-Kings.

Led by conductor David Campbell (Beck's father), they backed the singer, who was at the centre of the room on a small circular stage.

Three panoramic cameras were mounted around the venue, along with specially built 'heads' to capture sound in 3D.

'From the way we arranged the song down to the live performance, we were focused on the idea of immersing the live and online audiences' audio senses by having the music come at them from every direction,' said Beck.

'It's difficult to re-create a live concert, but by using this 360-degree approach, it opens up an entirely new kind of experience that will surprise people.'

The site also allows the viewer to see the choir and orchestra, and pan around complete with 360 sound to hear exactly what they would

Viewers can also take a wider view to see the gig from an audience member's point of view

Working alongside concert production designer Willo Perron, Director Chris Milk transformed Stage 14 at Fox Studios in Los Angeles into a circular, rotating music hall in which the stage surrounds the audience.

As more than 160 different musicians fill the circular stage, they’ll literally rotate around the crowd, creating an immersive sound experience unlike any other.

There are three locations for 360 video and audio, and on the website you can select them and hear exactly what you'd hear if you were there

This bizarre recording device – sculpted into 
the shape of a human head and surrounded by lifelike ears – captures 
sound in a 360-degree immersive style, the way a person would actually 
hear it if they were sitting in the performance space with the 
musicians.

Three of the heads were placed around the venue, including one on stage, so viewers could hear exactly what the musicians would.

Organisers claim 'The result is a track that actually captures a moment in time.

'It’s
not your typical compressed studio-recording, but an emotion-evoking, 
wave-your-hands-in-the-air, lighter-raising type of experience.'
