Legendary horror writer Clive Barker stands accused of giving his ex-boyfriend HIV then kicking him out on the street years later.

Emilian David Armstrong claims in a new lawsuit that British-born Barker gave him HIV sixteen years ago, reported TMZ.

After meeting in 1996, the couple quickly moved in together, along with Armstrong’s daughter from a previous heterosexual relationship.

The lawsuit claims that Barker urged Armstrong to get tested after he tested positive for HIV. Armstrong says he was diagnosed with the disease in November 1996.

According to the suit, Barker confessed to previously having a sexual relationship with his own cousin, who had AIDS, as well as engaging in sadomasochism in prior relationships where syringes were involved.

Explaining the 16 year delay before filing a lawsuit, Armstrong says that he and Barker attempted to battle HIV together before their relationship started to spiral in 2003.

The relationship deteriorated around the same time Barker, now 59, became addicted to prescription painkillers, according to the suit.

Armstrong alleges that Barker would mix the drugs with alcohol, cocaine, and, at times, crystal meth.

Armstrong accuses his ex-boyfriend of throwing grug-fueled parties with men as young as 19.

In 2009, Barker threw Armstrong out of his house – leaving Armstrong and his daughter destitute.

Armstrong claims that he was also a business partner to Barker and is entitled to a cut of his profits. He says that he was promised support from life.

Barker has made no comment.

The revelations came the same day that Amazon Studios announced they had hired Barker to rewrite 'Zombies vs. Gladiators,' an action horror project.

Barker is best known for his horror and fantasy novels, and his fiction has been turned into films, including the popular Hellraiser and Candyman series.
