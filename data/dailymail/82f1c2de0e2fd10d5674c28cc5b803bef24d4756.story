For some women, mother's day is a painful reminder of children lost too soon.

Valarie's Watts is still mourning the death of her son Noah, after giving birth to the stillborn baby boy last July.

But a kind act from a perfect stranger is helping the Cokato, Minnesota mom deal with her boy's passing.

Tragic loss: Valarie Watts (left) lost her son Noah at birth last July. The boy was born stillborn after his umbilical cord became pinched in the womb

Ms Watts says she first noticed something was wrong with her pregnancy a few weeks before her due date, when she stopped feeling Noah kick.

'All week I knew,' she told KMSP. 'He wasn't moving as much. I was very nervous.'

She later learned that the umbilical cord had become pinched in the womb, and by the time she went into labor it was too late.

Overcome by Noah's loss, Ms Watts refused to part with the crib she had assembled for her baby boy until an older couple took interest in it at her family's garage sale last month.

Craftsman Gerald Kumpula turns second-hand furniture into benches, and saw the crib as his next project.

When she heard about Mr Kumpula's projects, Ms Watts said she hesitated to sell the crib, which wasn't originally a part of the sale. But she ended up giving the crib to him anyway.

At the time, Kumpula didn't know the significance the crib held to the woman.

It was only in the car ride home with his wife that he heard Ms Watts' stragic story.

'His wife was was there looking through my garage sale - at some of the baby clothes - and asked how old my son was since I don't use the crib anymore, and I told her that he had passed in July,' Ms Watts said.

No idea: When he purchased the crib, Mr Kumpula didn't know about Ms Watts' tragic loss. But his wife, who spoke with Watts at the garage sale, told him about the stillborn baby on the car ride home from the sale. He decided to turn the crib into a bench and return it to the mother

Overcome with emotions: Ms Watts says she broke down in tears when Mr Kumpula brought her son's crib back as a bench the following week

The craftsman decided then and there that the crib would be returned to Ms Watts - but in a different form. 

About a week later Mr Kumpula brought the crib back to Ms Watts house, having turned it into a large chair.

Ms Watts says she immediately started crying when she saw her son's crib turned into something beautiful by a complete stranger.

'It's amazing, and there's good people out there. There's proof,' Ms Watts said.
