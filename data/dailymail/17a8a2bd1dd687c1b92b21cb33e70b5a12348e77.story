A new drama about the English teacher who was held over the murder of Jo Yeates has begun filming.

Trollied star Jason Watkins had shoppers doing a double take as he walked the streets in his latest TV role about Christopher Jefferies, who was arrested on suspicion of killing the 25-year-old.

Watkins bears an uncanny resemblance to the landlord, 68, who was arrested following the murder of the landscape architect Jo at Christmas 2010.

The Lost Honour is a two-part dramatisation of the ordeal 68-year-old Christopher Jefferies went through after Joanna Yeates was murdered in December 2010

The dramatisation is written by Peter Morgan, who wants to make sure no-one forgets that Mr Jefferies was never charged

ITV are creating a new two-part dramatisation called ‘The Lost Honour’ - with doppelganger Jason Watkins, from Sky 1s  'Trollied' and BBC Three’s ‘Being Human’, playing Mr Jefferies.

The lookalike was today seen wandering around the streets of quaint Clifton, in Bristol.

The drama begins the day before Jo disappeared and follows Mr Jefferies through his arrest, release and subsequent isolation.

As filming began Jason Watkins, dressed all in black, could be seen buying a loaf of sourdough bread in one scene, and walking along famous Clifton streets in another.

The dramatisation is written by Peter Morgan, Bafta-winning writer of Frost/Nixon and The Queen, and directed by Roger Michell, director of ‘Notting Hill’ and ex-pupil of Jefferies’.

Christopher Jefferies, seen on the left in 2010, is fully behind the project and has read and approved the script

'No-one will ever forget the man with the eccentric hair who became so connected with the murder of Joanna Yeates,' Mr Morgan said.

'I want to make sure no-one forgets the same man who was acquitted, who fought back to clear his name and became a very British kind of hero.'

In fact Mr Jefferies was never charged, let alone tried and acquitted.

Mr Michell added: 'It’s a story that celebrates our right to be eccentric and it also, as it happens, is the story of a rather brilliant man, who was once my English teacher.'

Mr Jefferies is fully behind the project and has read and approved the script.

Scenes such as the police interrogation are based on transcripts from the interviews he actually had.

Producer Kevin Loader said: 'This is about what it’s like to be accused of a crime you know you didn’t commit and being in police custody, not realising you’ve become the most famous man in Britain for all the wrong reasons.'

Joanna Yeates, 25, was killed by neighbour Vincent Tabak, who was jailed for a minimum of 20 years

Jo disappeared from her home in Bristol after going for Christmas drinks with work colleagues. Her body was found dumped on a verge in north Somerset, on Christmas Day

Filming will also take place at Bottle Yard Studios, where Mr Jefferies’ flat and police interview rooms have been recreated.

The two-part drama is being made by Carnival Films and will be screened on ITV1, late next Spring.

In a bid to be as realistic as possible, Mr Watkins’ balding hair has been dyed to match how Mr Jefferies looked after he had been exonerated.

Ms Yeates' body was found by walkers on Christmas Day 2010 after she vanished from home eight days before on December 18.

Dutch engineer Vincent Tabak, Ms Yeates’ neighbour, was jailed for a minimum of 20 years in October 2011 after being found guilty of her murder.
