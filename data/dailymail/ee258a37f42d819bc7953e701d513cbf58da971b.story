Mammal-like robots with whiskered touch systems,machines powered by slime and dancing humanoids that can communicate with humans are just a few of the robots invading the Science Museum today.

The International Living Machines conference showcases a wide array of strange machines that not only advance robotics but help 
scientists understand more about nature’s living organisms by trying to 
replicate their functions.

Led by the University of Sheffield, the event unites technologists from around the globe to explore the future of biomimetic and biohybrid technologies with a focus on future life-like robots.

The international Living Machines conference showcases a wide array of strange machines that help scientists understand more about nature by trying to replicate it. The Shadow Dexterous anthropomorphic hand has twenty degrees of freedom, force sensors and ultra sensitive touch sensors on the fingertips

Cutting edge machines in the spotlight include robots that move and sense like animals, biohybrid exhibits that mix biological and artificial parts, including an emotionally-expressive robot controlled by slime mould and the latest biomimetic medical devices that draw their inspiration from the natural world.

The conference is concerned with the development of future technologies using the principles underlying living systems and the flow of communication signals between living and artificial systems.

Professor Tony Prescott from the 
University of Sheffield’s Department of Psychology said: 'These 
technologies will have a profound effect on many different aspects of 
our future lives, posing important ethical questions and practical 
concerns that this event gives us chance to address.'

Many of the robots seek to replicate nature's sense of touch.

Each artificial whisker can be moved to explore objects, while a sensor gives a perception of touch.

fingertip called Tacitip that mimics one of the most sophisticated and 
sensitive tactile sensors in nature.

The technology is based based upon scientists' understanding of how the epidermal layers of the fingertip are deformed
 during touch as is demonstrated on a humanoid robot hand.

Scientists are also excited by the prospect of combining the natural with the artificial.

Biological
 and artificial sciences are converging as technologists realise that 
natural and engineered systems share common principles.

Slime mould is used in an installation that 
includes a robotic head emoting the responses of the mould to 
external stimuli and a demonstration of the learning abilities of the 
mould in robot tasks

Scientists believe the
 possibility of creating biohybrid machines that combine biological and 
artificial parts will radically change our technology and blur the 
boundary between the natural and the artificial.

In
 the future we may also find ourselves becoming more 'biohybrid,' as we 
become more intimately linked to the machines that serve us.

One example of a biohybrid machine on display at the exhibition uses 'slime mould'  - the largest single 
cell visible to the human eye that lives in woods digesting dead leaf and
 tree material but is also capable of simple learning and memory.

the responses of the slime mould to external stimuli, and a 
demonstration of the learning abilities of the mould in robot tasks.

The
 exhibition also includes a 'living wearable' made from colour-changing 
cells, inspired by the skin of a chameleon that changes colour to 
indicate the intensity of the wearer’s emotions.

There are also biomimec machines that draw inspiration from nature, including robots that behave like octopuses, worms and fish.

A life sized interactive multi-lingual humanoid called Robothespian can interact with real humans by talking and using its expressive LCD eyes. The robot can entertain an audience by reading text expressively and even mimicking the movements of humans

A quadruped robot mammal called HyQ by Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia is on display that is the most advanced in the world. It weights approximately 70 kilogrammes and is around the size of a large dog.

A life sized interactive multi-lingual humanoid called Robothespian, which was developed by Engineered Arts, can interact with real humans by talking and using its expressive LCD eyes.

The robot was designed to be a science education tool and entertain an audience by reading text expressively and even mimicking the movements of humans.

A humanoid known as iCub (pictured), who is part of the eFAA Project, can dance and interact with music.The robot is designed to demonstrate its emotional capability by establishing a sense of understanding and enjoyment with a human dancer

Another humanoid known as iCub, who is part of the eFAA Project, can dance and interact with music.

It performs a repertoire of dance-like movements, proving its ability to learn by perceiving actions, in dialogue with the dancer Anuska Fernandez.

The robot is designed to demonstrate its emotional capability by establishing a sense of understanding and enjoyment with a human dancer.

An artistic robot called Paul can sketch people who pose for it and was engineered using sophisticated technologies from research fields such as computer vision, artificial intelligence, cognitive computing and robotics

Another artistic robot called Paul can sketch people who pose for it and was engineered using sophisticated technologies from research fields such as computer vision, artificial intelligence, cognitive computing and robotics.

At a superficial level, Paul, developed by Patrick Tresset, is the modern equivalent to the court automata of the 18th century, but the robot is accurate and shifts its attention between the human subject and its drawing in the 30 minute sitting.
