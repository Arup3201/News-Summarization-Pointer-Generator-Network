A man who fell from a bridge and was declared dead was taken to a mortuary - where staff were shocked to realise he still had a pulse.

The unnamed man in his 40s was certified as dead by paramedics soon after falling more than 100ft from Kessock Bridge in Inverness - a notorious suicide spot - on Friday night.

He was not examined by doctors, and was instead taken directly to the mortuary at Raigmore Hospital.

When workers found a pulse on the supposed corpse, they summoned paramedics once again, but attempts to resuscitate the man proved unsuccessful and he was pronounced dead for the second time.

An investigation has now been launched into the worrying incident.

The man had been in the water for 10 minutes when he was retrieved by a lifeboat and taken to Inverness Marina.

Although an ambulance crew attempted to revive him, they believed they had failed.

Last night Conservative MSP Mary Scanlon called for a thorough inquiry to be undertaken and the results made public in full.

'Any death is a tragedy for the family but the circumstances surrounding this death will undoubtedly raise questions as to whether this person could have perhaps survived,' she said.

'It is a shocking story for our ambulance service who have the highest level of training and exercise quality care every day of the year. It is so shocking because it is so rare to hear of anything like this.

'A very clear explanation and a very thorough inquiry must be carried out.'

The Crown Office, which is responsible for investigating suspicious deaths, confirmed that it was involved in the case.

'The investigation into the death, under the direction of Scottish Fatalities Investigation Unit, is ongoing and the family will continue to be kept updated in relation to any significant developments,' a spokesman said.

Both the Scottish Ambulance Service and NHS Highland are conducting their own internal reviews.

The ambulance service insisted that every effort was made at the scene to resuscitate the man before he was pronounced dead.

'Despite active resuscitation being carried out by the ambulance crew with no response, a clinical assessment was undertaken, including ongoing cardiac monitoring, and confirmed the patient had died,' a spokesman said.

NHS Highland confirmed the alarm was raised when, while checking the body, mortuary staff became concerned there were 'potential signs of life'.

It said in a statement: 'The Scottish Ambulance Service and an internal cardiac arrest team attended and resuscitation was immediately commenced. Despite this, evidence of ongoing signs of life could not be confirmed.'

Police are not treating the death of the man, who was from the Highlands, as suspicious.
