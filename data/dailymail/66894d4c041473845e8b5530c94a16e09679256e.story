Asylum seekers brought to the Australian mainland will seek compensation after being detained at sea for three weeks.

The 157 asylum seekers including 50 children, who were detained on a Customs ship, are now at the Curtin detention centre in Western Australia after being flown from Cocos Island on Sunday.

In a directions hearing on Monday, Justice Kenneth Hayne allowed lawyers for the asylum seekers to adjust their statement of claim to one of false imprisonment, with an application for compensation.

A High Court hearing to determine if the government had the power to intercept their boat and transport them somewhere other than Australia will now not be scheduled for next week.

The group of 157 asylum seekers were not 'economic migrants' and would apply for asylum in Australia, according to a lawyer representing them.

The group of 157, including children, has been detained at sea since their boat was intercepted 27km from Christmas Island on July 7

They were headed to the Cocos Islands airport where they will be flown to Curtin detention centre in Western Australia.

Australian Greens say the asylum seeker group has a legal right to apply for asylum in Australia

Human rights lawyer and spokesman for the asylum seekers' legal team Hugh de Kretser said the case would still proceed, but on a more normal timeline.

'The main case which tests the legality of the government's actions - whether it was legal or not to take these asylum seekers away from Australia, detain them at sea for a month - remains," Mr de Kretser said.

He said the case was now about two things: was it illegal for the government to take people away from Australia and detain them for a month at sea and if so, should the asylum seekers receive compensation for that.

Mr de Kretser said it was too early to say how much asylum seekers would be seeking.

It also emerged on Monday that 50 of the 157 asylum seekers are children.

The group's boat was intercepted 27km from Christmas Island on July 7.

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said it was a positive outcome for the government's case.

The court had agreed the case was now hypothetical and it was no longer appropriate to continue with next week's hearing, he said in a statement.

The government had cooperated fully with the court and abided by all undertakings willingly and would continue to do so, he said.

All people associated with the case had been transferred to the Curtin facility, Mr Morrison said.

They were ineligible to apply for a protection visa in Australia and subject to transfer for offshore processing.

The Indian government was open to consider the return of former or current Indian residents or nationals, including people who may have previously been in refugee camps in India, Mr Morrison said.

But this would be subject to their identities being confirmed.

India has agreed to take back its citizens and will consider taking Sri Lankan nationals who are Indian residents.

Australian Greens say the group has a legal right to apply for asylum in Australia.

Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young is travelling to Curtin in the next few days to inquire on the children's welfare and to brief the asylum seekers of their rights.

'Just because (Prime Minister) Tony Abbott wants to trade in their lives, doesn't make it legal,' she said in Adelaide on Sunday.

Mr Abbott has said the handling of the asylum seekers is legal and in accordance with Australia's international obligations.

But he stressed they could never call Australia home because they did not come the 'right way'.

The decision to bring the group to land pre-empts a High Court challenge against their detention at sea.

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison vowed the passengers who do not return to their country of origin would be sent to Nauru or Manus Island.

This is part of a new asylum-seeker deal where about two-thirds of the 157 passengers could be sent back to India.

It is believed the asylum seekers will be taken to Curtin Detention Centre in Western Australia

A High Court case is trying to establish whether the detention of the asylum seekers on board the vessel, is legal under the Maritime Powers Act.

Mr Morrison said that once the asylum seekers arrive in Australia, Indian officials will be granted consular access, and the Indian government has agreed to accept Indian citizens and some Sri Lankan nationals back into the country.

The minister would not confirm what would happen to any asylum seekers on board the vessel who were not found to be Indian or Sri Lankan nationals, but stated categorically that 'they will not be resettled [in Australia].'
