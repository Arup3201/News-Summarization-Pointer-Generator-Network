Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a libertarian-leaning senator will officially announce his candidacy for president at a rally in Louisville, Kentucky on April 7, a senior adviser to the Republican politician told Daily Mail Online.

With Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the race for the White House as of this morning, when he kicked off his own bid with a tweet, Paul plans to follow suit and launch his own campaign in just over two weeks.

Louisville, the adviser said, was selected over Paul's hometown, Bowling Green, the city from which he set in motion his quest to become a U.S. senator, for optimum venue space.

Even before Cruz, 44, kicked off his 2016 bid, Paul, 52, had his eye on April 7 as a launch date for his own national campaign. But the fellow Republican's formal announcement helped to solidify Paul's plans. 

Determined not to be the first major White House hopeful to wade into the shark-infested waters, Paul intended to wait until at least one other prominent Republican contender swam out to sea.

Already, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and wealthy businessman and reality TV star Donald Trump had publicly said they were forming presidential exploratory committees.

Such committees allow them to legally collect money for the purposes of travelling around the country to 'test the waters' for a bid and to conduct polling.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has made clear that he will pursue a presidential campaign but has not yet held the kind of large-scale event that typically accompanies the launch of a national campaign.

Cruz, voted into the Senate during the last presidential election in 2012, has selected a Christian college in Virginia as the backdrop for the public unveiling of his national enterprise. He'll make the announcement this morning at Liberty University even though he's yet to establish an exploratory committee.

Paul has not yet signed paperwork legalizing a committee either but could do so in the two weeks before he throws his name into the ring.

Up for reelection this year, the Republican lawmaker first had to settle an in-house dispute over whether he could pursue his current job and the one that he wants at the same time.

Earlier this month the Kentucky GOP gave him its blessing to do both. As a result, the state will have a one-time caucus, paid for by Paul, to determine its presidential nominee so that Paul can remain on a statewide ballot as a candidate for the U.S. Senate, as well.

If he nabs the Republican nomination for president, however, he'll have to take the state to court in order to protect his fail safe measure, as Kentucky law does not allow a politician to appear on the ballot twice for two separate positions. 

And Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, the loser of last fall's Senate competition, vowed to force Paul to play by the rules. 

Paul, 52, peaks with diners at Pink Cadillac Diner on Saturday in Rochester, New Hampshire. Paul, who has made many trips to New Hampshire which holds the first primary in the nation. Even before Cruz kicked off his 2016 bid, Paul had his eye on April 7 as a launch date for his own national campaign. But the fellow Republican's formal announcement solidified his plans

Additional heavy hitters presumably joining the crowded field of Republican presidential candidates - former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie - have offered fewer hints about when they drop the curtain on their expected campaigns.

Currently they are running shadow campaigns, under the guise of their leadership PACs, and have all taken the preliminary steps to build apparatuses that can compete nationally.

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Hewlett Packard executive Carly Fiorina could also enter the race as dark horse candidates. Both have hinted at possible runs, but neither has strongly signaled interest or adopted an aggressive campaign schedule compared to the likes of Cruz, Bush, Paul and others.

The candidates known to be all or mostly in have spent the better part of the year building their fan bases in early primary states, chiefly Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, and shoring up key Republican donors.

Democrats' top contender, Hillary Clinton, is also close to making an announcement, which could reportedly come early as next Wednesday.  

The political front was mostly quiet on Monday morning, however, as Cruz prepared to lay out his vision for the country in a convocation speech at Liberty, the largest Christian higher-education institution in America, save for a few tweets from his well-known detractors

The Democratic National Committee hit him several times over the social media network as the 'architect of the disastrous 2013 government shutdown' and forwarded reporters an article positing that Cruz, a Hispanic whose father fled communist Cuba, could actually 'make the relationship between Republicans and Latinos even tougher.'

The premise of the Fusion piece was that in making his debut as a national candidate at a university 'whose student body is at least half white,' Cruz, whose policies on issues like immigration are already considered 'divisive' by some, won't attract the kind of support from minority groups that one would expect given his family tree.

American Bridge, a progressive, political action committee, tweeted that that the GOP's 'race to the extreme starts today' with Cruz's personal announcement.

In a statement the group's president, Brad Woodhouse, also went after Cruz for his role in the 2013 Senate standoff that left the government in limbo for more than two weeks.

'Ted Cruz shut down the government in a tantrum, opposes marriage equality, denies climate change, and opposes a woman’s right to choose even in cases of rape or incest,' Woodhouse said.

'He’s everything voters hate about the modern Republican Party in one candidate' Woodhouse claimed, 'and the entire field is already signing on to his positions.'
