When Roberto Martinez met Samuel Eto’o one Sunday in late August for a coffee, there was only one question he wanted answering.

Did he have the hunger to play on a cold afternoon in the North West, when the going was tough and the environment was unforgiving? Everton’s manager never had a concern about Eto’o’s quality but he needed to see if the desire was still there.

Eto’o has never given Martinez a moment to think he made a wrong move but his decision was vindicated once again at blustery Turf Moor, as his two goals inspired Everton to a comfortable 3-1 victory over Burnley.

As Eto’o left the pitch with the acclaim of 4,000 travelling Evertonians ringing in his ears, a number of Martinez’s managerial peers — not least Brendan Rodgers — may well have been regretting that they allowed the chance to sign him slip away. He may be 33 but he still has much to offer. 

‘I like Samuel when he is in that type of form,’ said Martinez, who saw Romelu Lukaku atone for the mistake that gifted Burnley a goal by scoring Everton’s second. 

‘He can play anywhere. He brings real know-how and experience. Sometimes, you want to develop young players. 

'But he can give them a lot of aspects technically, tactically and physically. There’s few people who can teach things like Samuel due to his experience. 

'Everyone will speak about the goals but I was so pleased with the performance he had, his role off the ball and the way he worked hard for the team.

‘He has set real standards and I’m really pleased. He has played two games in a week, but his performance was a real example. What an incredible professional to have in a dressing room full of young players.’

That point is key. Some will carp and say Eto’o has thrived against a side who are heading back to the Championship but that overlooks the fact that he arrived on Merseyside as one of a select group who have won the Champions League at two different clubs.

The moment he walked into Goodison Park, Eto’o — once of Barcelona and Internazionale —had the respect of his new team-mates and he was a calming influence here, always making the right decision and using the ball sensibly. 

He set a tone that was the catalyst for a clinical performance.

In order to give his team some freshness following their midweek trip to Lille, Martinez made six changes to Everton’s starting line-up and his reward was a blistering start that left Burnley frantically trying to catch their breath. 

Samuel Eto'o worked his socks off in Everton’s win at Turf Moor. Far from his more familiar role as a target man, he played as an attacking midfielder in support of Romelu Lukaku. 

Though nominally playing down the left, he roved across the width of the pitch, as the heat map of his main areas of activity shows (below). And he put in a shift in his own box for corners too. Not too shabby for a 33-year-old.

When Everton’s passing clicks, they are an impressive side to watch and never was that more apparent than in the fourth minute as the ball zipped from one white shirt to another, sweeping the length of the pitch. 

The move culminated in Gareth Barry sending Leighton Baines scampering down the left and the England full back’s inch-perfect cross was given the finish it deserved, as Eto’o’s bullet header thudded against the underside of the bar before hitting the back of Tom Heaton’s net. 

Burnley were startled by Everton’s speed out of the blocks but gradually they regained composure themselves and they received an expected gift in the 20th minute that enabled them to secure parity.

Everton were in no danger when Romelu Lukaku took possession just by the halfway line but, carelessly and inexplicably, he gave the ball to Lukas Jutkiewicz, who wasted no time sending Danny Ings away. 

The England Under 21 striker did the rest, rounding Tim Howard and finishing with aplomb.

Much to Burnley’s frustration, however, it wasn’t long before they conceded cheaply once again. 

They had only been on terms for eight minutes when Steven Naismith found Lukaku in the area and he made up for his aberration with a shot that bobbled beyond Heaton.

This was Everton’s first victory over Burnley at Turf Moor for 44 years. It was also the first time they have enjoyed successive league wins since April.

Burnley worked hard after the break but, for all their huff and puff, they rarely looked like blowing Everton over and in the 85th minute they were seen off when Barry, Ross Barkley and Steven Pienaar combined to give Eto’o the chance to bend a drive in from 25 yards.

Moments later, he rounded Heaton again but his shot from a tight angle bounced off the post. It was the only slight blip on an otherwise exemplary display.

‘It was a very challenging day against a fine team,’ said Sean Dyche, whose Burnley side are still winless. ‘Eto’o has been a fine player and still is. Everton had high-quality players doing what high-quality players do. We all wanted Premier League football but nobody said it’d be an easy ride.
