Her son beat up and raped a law student who had been thrown off the last bus home for being 20p short of a £5 fare.

But Sarah Moran showed no more shame or remorse than her child Joseph did as he was jailed indefinitely yesterday for the 'brutal and horrific' attack.

She protested outside court in a jumper bearing the 19-year-old thug's face under the word 'innocent' and carrying makeshift signs. She insisted he had been falsely convicted.

Deluded: Joseph Moran's mother Sarah pleads his innocence outside Nottingham Crown Court

Mrs Moran, who arrived at Nottingham Crown Court with her son's girlfriend and several family members and friends, said his DNA was found at the scene only because he had cut his arm.

He had simply stumbled across the girl in Nottingham city centre at 3.30am one night last December and had gone to her aid, she maintained.

Jailed: Joseph Moran, 19, of Sneinton, Nottingham, claimed he had stumbled across the 23-year-old victim and helped her last December

The judge branded her son a 
'pathological liar' for sticking to the story throughout the case.

In 
fact, Moran had pounced on the young woman after she was left stranded 
in the dark.

In a chilling example of Britain at 
its most heartless, the 23-year-old had not been allowed to stay on the 
last bus home because she was 20p short of the fare.

Disturbing CCTV footage showed her pleading with the driver for eight minutes, while his  passengers simply watched.

The girl had to call her mother to ask her to pick her up and began walking in the direction she would be approaching from.

But, after travelling less than a mile, she was pounced on by Moran, who, drunk and high on cannabis, dragged her into a park and subjected her to a 25-minute attack.

After being found guilty of rape and 
wounding with intent, Moran was handed an indeterminate sentence for the
protection of the public.

Picking his fingers and nonchalantly 
stretching his arms in the dock, he was told he must serve a minimum of 
six-and-a-half years before he will be considered for release.

He will 
be freed only if he is no longer seen as a danger to society.

The 23-year-old woman thanked those involved in bringing her attacker to justice in a statement issued through local police.

She said: ‘First and foremost, I would like to thank my family for their unwavering and unremitting support and prayers during what has been a very difficult time.

‘I would also like to thank the staff at the Queen's Medical Centre for the dedication, professionalism, care and consideration demonstrated by them during my week in hospital and in the weeks that followed on my return for further treatment.

‘The police have not only worked extremely hard on this case, they have also offered a great deal of pastoral support and shown incredible sensitivity towards me, something that often goes unrecognised. For that I will always be grateful.

‘I am now moving forward with my life and I ask that people respect that and allow me and my family to maintain our privacy.’

Judge James Sampson said Moran had 
carried out a 'brutal and horrific' attack and had not shown 'an ounce 
of remorse or shame' for what he had done.

He said his victim was 'intelligent, 
hard-working, brave, full of the optimism of youth, and delightful', 
adding that she 'for the want of a small act of kindness was left 
isolated and vulnerable in the small hours'.

Michael Auty, prosecuting, told the 
hearing the attack was 'every parent's darkest fear'.

However, the court
heard the courageous student had returned to her course and had 
achieved a good grade in her law degree.

Detective Chief Inspector Rob Griffin,
who was in charge of the investigation, described Moran as a 'vile 
predator'.

He said police had been humbled by the victim's 'bravery and 
resilience'.

Despite overwhelming evidence, Moran's
mother yesterday clutched posters saying 'Miscarriage of justice Lies 
told in Court' and 'Convicted with no evidence Joseph Moran Innocent'.

Until about a year before the attack 
Moran lived in the rough neighbourhood of Sneinton with his mother.

A 
neighbour said: 'With a mum like that, Joseph never stood a chance.'
