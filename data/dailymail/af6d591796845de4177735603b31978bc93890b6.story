At 34-year old woman face an agonizing decision as to whether she should keep her baby after being told she was pregnant at the same time as being diagnosed with breast cancer.

Adele Rivas believed that she was too young to have breast cancer despite her mother having to fight the disease when she was in her 40s, but after finding a lump in her breast she went to hospital to have it looked at.

After being diagnosed with stage two breast cancer, she received some news that she was completely unprepared for - that of a pregnancy.

One-two punch: Adele Rivas underwent chemotherapy treatments while pregnant with her first son

Adele has a feeling she might have cancer because her mother contracted it when she was in her 40s, but she never dreamed that she would be pregnant as well because she had been declared infertile

The news seemed all the more remarkable because despite Mrs Rivas and her husbands attempts to have a baby, she had been told that she was infertile and was eve looking at adopting a child.

Doctors quickly ordered an MRI scan, but Mrs Rivas, a physician's assistant, was hesitant knowing that the MRI could affect an early pregnancy.

In the end, she decide to take a simple pregnancy test.

''A voice told me 'You're really in denial,' about cancer, Rivas recalled to ABC News. 

When a nurse came back after the test, she told Rivas it was likely positive but it was so early to be sure, they would have to wait another 48 hours for doctors to be completely sure.'

I left that day not knowing if I was pregnant but knowing I have breast cancer,' she said. 

Rivas is not alone as one in 3,000 pregnant women will be diagnosed with breast cancer

After doctors repeated the test to confirm she was pregnant there were still many other decisions to take - including big questions over whether she could even keep the baby whilst undergoing treatment for cancer. 

Shortly afterwards, Mrs Rivas came to Mt. Sinai hospital In New York to begin her treatment. 

'The way that you treat it, really depends on a lot of factors including at what stage of the pregnancy [the cancer] is diagnosed,' said Weltz, a breast surgeon at the Dubin Breast Center at The Mount Sinai Hospital. 

'The question that really arises for every aspect of the treatment is whether the breast cancer treatment is compromising the safety of the pregnancy or if maintaining a safe pregnancy is compromising the treatment of the breast cancer?'

Mrs Rivas decided to keep the pregnancy, but go through a grueling treatment schedule that included a mastectomy at six weeks and then receive chemotherapy in her second and third trimesters. 

Dr. Joanne Stone, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive science at Mt. Sinai hospital in New York, treated Rivas and said she hoped Rivas' story would give other women comfort if they're diagnosed with cancer during pregnancy.

'What I think is really important about this story is that people know you can get diagnosed and you can get treated when you're pregnant,' said Dr. Stone.

Emotionally and physically, the pregnancy coupled with the cancer made for a grueling journey.

Her body changed as she put on weight as the baby grew and not only due to pregnancy but the treatment as well. While her appetite was steady, the chemotherapy led to hair loss. 

'After the chemo was done, I was pretty much a normal pregnant person without hair,' said Rivas. 'I looked pretty silly and no boobs--it was just crazy.'

Adele credits help from her husband Luis for keeping her sane. Their little baby boy is now six months old and healthy

The couple moved into her mothers house so save some money during the time as well.   

After four rounds of chemotherapy, two months later she gave birth to a baby boy.

Despite her worried that he might be born early or underweight, her fears proved to be unfounded and he born weighing more than 8 pounds.   

Six months on, the couple are still living with Mrs Rivas' mother but life is starting to a new normal.

Looking back, Mrs Rivas says she never would have imagined she would have been able to get this far.

'I can't believe how fast things can change and how much you can endure,' Mrs Rivas said. 

'I think of myself as a pretty tough person. If anyone told me that I was able to go through this, I would say they're nuts.'
