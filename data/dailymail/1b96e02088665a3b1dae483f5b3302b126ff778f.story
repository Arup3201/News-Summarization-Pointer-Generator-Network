A new mother whose life was saved by an emergency Caesarean section almost died after her wound became infected by a deadly bug.

Katy Yates developed the life-threatening high blood pressure condition pre-eclampsia eight weeks before her due date which put her life, and that of her unborn baby, at risk.

Medics safely delivered the 32-year-old’s daughter, Phoebe, but Mrs Yates developed a rare flesh-eating bug and was left fighting for her life.

Katy Yates (with husband Steve) had to have daughter Phoebe by emergency C-section after developing the high blood pressure condition pre-eclampsia

Surgeons removed 6lb of flesh from her stomach in a bid to stop the bug spreading and she managed to fight off the infection.

Mrs Yates, from Oswestry, Shropshire, said: ‘I was in agony but put it down to having surgery. I'd never had a caesarean section before so I didn't know what to expect.

‘I couldn't walk and had a raging fever.

‘Antibiotics didn't work so they had to cut the infection out. I was left with a gaping hole.

‘It's taken me a long time to recover – not just physically but emotionally.

‘I would go through it again to get to this point.’

Mrs Yates and her husband Steve, 31, 
spent five years trying for a baby before she conceived thanks to the 
fertility drug Clomid.

She had to be closely monitored during her pregnancy after a scan showed her baby was not growing at the rate it should be.

While Phoebe was delivered safely, Mrs Yates then went on to develop a rare flesh-eating bug and was left fighting for her life

The couple, who both work for their family's gift experience company, were dealt another blow when doctors discovered an abnormality of the umbilical cord, putting their baby at a greater risk heart defects.

Then, at 32 weeks, Mrs Yates was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia and rushed to theatre for an emergency Caesarean section.

The a development manager, said: ‘We'd just come back from a weekend away and had gone in for a routine check-up.

‘I never expected I'd be having my baby but the pre-eclampsia developed very fast.

‘It was a case of: “You are in danger. We need to get this baby out now”.

Phoebe had to be taken to Shrewsbury Hospital's special care baby unit for treatment immediately after her birth

Necrotising fasciitis is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection. It can destroy skin, muscles and fat.

It develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area.

Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body.

Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock are also common complications.

Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg.

‘I was very poorly. They were giving me so many drugs to stop me having fits.’

When Phoebe was born she was 
immediately transferred to the special care baby unit and kept in an 
incubator because she was so small.

Mrs Yates said: ‘I didn't even get to hold her. I got to give her a kiss and that was it.

‘I was still really ill so I couldn't
go and see her. My blood pressure couldn't be controlled so I had to 
have a nurse sit with me all the time.

‘In the evening, they wheeled her down for a few minutes and I got to have my first cuddle.’

After four days, Mrs Yates condition 
had not improved but she was keen to be discharged so she could spend 
time with her new daughter.

Doctors at Shrewsbury Hospital agreed on the condition that she returned for daily check-ups.

Mrs Yates said: ‘I still felt horrendous. I was sweating but I was freezing cold.

‘I had a dressing on my wound and noticed it had a foul smell. I had black bruising on my tummy.

‘I was in excruciating pain. I assumed I'd get better but it was getting worse and worse.

‘I couldn't walk and had to use a wheelchair.’

After being examined by a concerned midwife she was readmitted to hospital.

At
first, medics ruled out the flesh eating bug necrotising fasciitis but 
luckily another doctor spotted the signs and diagnosed her.

In the days after Phoebe's birth, both mother and daughter were fighting for their lives

The bug is caused by bacteria releasing toxins into the skin and muscle, forcing it to waste away.

Following
the diagnosis Mrs Yates was rushed into surgery where the infected 
flesh was cut away in an attempt to control the infection and stop it 
spreading.

She said: ‘I remember them telling me I had to go to theatre and panic set in.

‘They asked me if I wanted to go see 
Phoebe but I couldn't even move. Looking back, they probably said that 
because they thought I wouldn't survive.

‘After the operation, a doctor said 
if I hadn't been young and healthy I wouldn't have made it. My organs 
were shutting down and I'd not got much longer.

‘I didn't see Phoebe for a week. Steve had to split in two - going back and forth between us.’

Mrs Yates, who needed a further three operations, spent three weeks in hospital on powerful antibiotics.

Doctors told Mrs Yates (with Phoebe, now two) that she only survived the flesh-eating bug because she was young and healthy

She was also fitted with a vacuum pump to remove fluid from her wound and reduce the risk of the infection returning.

She said: ‘It should have been the happiest time of my life but it ended being the most traumatic.

‘When Phoebe came home a week after me, I couldn't care for her. I had to have somebody with me all the time.

‘As a mum you want to do it yourself, not watch someone else change your baby's nappy.

‘I couldn't bend to pick her up for several months - even holding her was difficult.

‘It meant I struggled to bond with her for a long time. I needed counselling.

Mrs Yates said: 'Before I had Phoebe, I had no idea of the risks of necrotising fasciitis It's more common than women realise'

‘Even now my back hurts when I pick her up because it has weakened the muscles in my stomach.

‘I still get pain from the scar and I have to be careful when Phoebe jumps on me.’

The couple hope to try for another baby in the future but are unsure how Mrs Yates’ body will cope during pregnancy because of the large scar.

Mrs Yates, a trustee of the Lee Spark Necrotising Fasciitis Foundation has raised £8,000 for the charity and is now making training DVDs to help maternity staff spot the signs for post-natal infections.

She said: ‘Before I had Phoebe, I had no idea of the risks. It's more common than women realise.

‘Fast diagnosis of necrotising fasciitis is imperative to survival. It can kill within 24 hours.

‘If I can help one woman it would make me feel like what I've been through was worthwhile.’
