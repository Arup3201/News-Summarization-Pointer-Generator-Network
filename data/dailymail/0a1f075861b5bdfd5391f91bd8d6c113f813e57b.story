Tortured: Shaurya Bulhara, aged six, was subjected to various forms of abuse from the age of three, suffering fractures and scars

The parents of a boy who was subjected to various forms of torture are now facing jail after being found guilty of attempt to murder.

The abuse started when Shaurya was three-years-old and getting justice for him, now aged 13, was a long hard-fought battle for his maternal grandparents.

His mother died when he was young and he lived with his father Lalit Balhara, a former Army Major, and step-mother Preeti Balhara.

During the trial, Shaurya said he was
 repeatedly tortured by the pair and claimed he was often locked up in a
 room without food and beaten with a stick when he would cry, reported The Times of India. 

He also said they would insert a stick in his mouth which broke some of his teeth.

The couple denied the 
allegations, saying the child was 'special' by birth.

They claimed he had suffered 
injuries after falling off chairs and tables, but the medical report coupled
 with the child's statement proved their guilt.

Shaurya endured a cycle of abuse -  when he was aged three he was rushed to hospital for consuming insecticides. 

After that incident, the abuse increased and he also suffered fractured ribs, a bleeding skull and smashed teeth, while his weight dropped significantly.

Yesterday the pair were charged with attempt to murder and also convicted under the Juvenile Justice Act.

The judgement was a victorious moment for Shaurya's grandparents who 
sought custody of the child in 2005 alleging his father, Lalit Balhara, 
and his wife, Preeti, were torturing the child after his mother died.

Damning X-rays: Multiple injuries sustained by Shaurya, including bone fractures and brain swelling, were explained away by his father and step-mother as him falling from chairs or tables

Terrible damage: A close-up photo of Shaurya's mouth shows damaged teeth, scarred skin and cut lips. It is alleged his parents forced a stick into his mouth as part of his punishment

When Shaurya was presented before the 
court on February 20, 2005, his physical and mental condition shocked 
the officials, according to the newspaper.

Doctors were then asked to file a medical report and the Major 
Balhara and his wife underwent psychiatric consultation at the Base 
Hospital, Delhi Cantontment.

The report stated the 'parents were unable to explain why the child 
sustained injuries and concluded Shaurya was suffering from a 'battered 
baby syndrome' - a combination of physical injuries such as broken bones,
 bruises, burns and malnutrition as a result of gross abuse by a parent 
or caregiver.

Convicted: Former army officer Lalit Bulhara and his second wife Preeti have been charged with attempted murder and have also been convicted under the Juvenile Justice Act 

Birth mother: Malit in 1997 with his first wife, unnamed in court papers, the biological mother of Shuarya

In February 2005, custody of Shaurya was granted to his grandparents.

Attempt to murder entails a maximum punishment of life imprisonment and the pair will find out their fate this week.

Soon after the judgment was pronounced, the Balharas who have been out on bail throughout the trial, were taken into custody.
