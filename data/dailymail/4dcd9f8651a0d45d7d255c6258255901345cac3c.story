As Toni Kroos produced yet another performance of midfield mastery, this time in a World Cup semi-final, thoughts turned to the Old Trafford boardroom and Manchester United’s peculiar pursuit of the German.

Under David Moyes, Kroos had emerged as United’s principal summer target, viewed by the Glaswegian as someone that could fill the vacuum vacated by Paul Scholes and restore order and authority to the central acres.

Moyes recognised that United’s midfield has been missing in action too often in recent times. In the hunger games, United were often found wanting, overpowered and overwhelmed in the central positions.

Liverpool and Manchester City, in 
particular, brutally exposed United’s lightweight midfield as short of 
the required standard last season, with Michael Carrick’s powers waning 
and Tom Cleverley and Marouane Fellaini failing to impress.

Following one Old Trafford defeat last season, one source close to the United squad joked that Moyes was having to play the ‘polo mint formation – with nothing in the middle.’

Moyes identified Kroos as the starting pistol for a United revolution this summer - one, of course, that he was fated to never oversee - and he worked long and hard in his attempts to cut a deal for the Germany star, whose contract with Bayern Munich will expire in 12 months’ time.

Against Brazil on Tuesday evening, Kroos demonstrated the qualities that so appealed to Moyes. Kroos is the player that represents, more than any other, the technical precision and control that defines this German side.

His long passes are on a sixpence, his short game equally accurate and inventive. Kroos is wonderfully minimalist in his movement, always available, always showing for the ball, as he drops deep, receives, lays it off, and moves the ball on with purpose.

He barely wastes a pass, his immense intellect for football dictating the tempo of this game on his terms, like so many others for Bayern Munich. He completed 93 per cent of his attempted passes and a 91.5 per cent success rate in the opposition’s half. Statistics can sometimes skew perceptions but these figures underline his immense talent.

Moyes flew to Germany to watch Kroos in action on several occasions,
 intensifying his interest around January and instructing his scouts to 
provide the extensive reports that he requires before committing to any 
major signing.

In March, Moyes ran the rule over Kroos’ performances in Bayern Munich’s 5-1 victory over Schalke and he then was at the Emirates Stadium to witness the German’s outstanding performance as Bayern beat Arsenal, with Kroos curling a beautiful effort to open the scoring. On that spring evening, he completed 147 passes, just 11 less than the entire Arsenal team managed over the 90 minutes.

Moyes ordered executive vice-chairman Edward Woodward to accelerate United’s pursuit. The United manager himself was reported to have held talks and entertained Kroos’ representatives as the club launched a charm offensive. A salary approaching £240,000-a-week was mooted.

Despite the absence of Champions League football next season, the noises United received were encouraging and there was a growing confidence the player would swap the Bundesliga for the Premier League next season.

When United faced Bayern in the Champions League quarter-final, Woodward spoke privately to supporters in Germany and is understood to have assured them that big plans were in place for this summer and that the club were hopeful over deals for Kroos and Marco Reus of Borussia Dortmund.

As the manager changed, so too did the targets. Louis van Gaal’s aversion to signing Kroos was greeted with surprise in the corridors of power at Old Trafford, particularly as the Dutchman was in charge at Bayern when the player emerged as a youngster of supreme talent in Germany.

His stance, however, was firm and United abandoned their extensive attempts to secure Kroos’ signature, instead focusing on Athletic Bilbao’s Ander Herrera, who was signed in a £28.4million deal in June.

United answered to Van Gaal’s demands, with Woodward overseeing a new structure in the scouting department as Moyes’ men, Robbie Cooke and James Smith, who had joined from Everton, swiftly being released.

The priorities changed but the decision to pass up on Kroos remains a chin-stroker. Paul Scholes admitted as much last week, stating: ‘It is good to see United bringing in new players, but they haven't signed anything like the quality of Kroos.’

The Herrera transfer fee exceeds the suggested cost for Kroos, who is now likely to move to Real Madrid for less than £25m, although United would rightly retort that the Spaniard’s wage package is almost four times less than what Kroos would have commanded.

One theory, as bizarre as it may sound, is that Van Gaal considers the German a little slow for the English game and that he lacks the athleticism to compete physically. Another suggestion is that United became aware of Real’s interest and withdrew before they were seen off by the greater financial and romantic pull of the Spanish side.

As Kroos continues to shine, the conjecture will continue but the feeling lingers that United have missed out on an extraordinary talent, and their loss will likely be Madrid’s gain.
