A family of four in suburban Spring, Texas was arrested last Friday after neighbors used a free police app to report suspicious activity at the home.

Raymond (57) and Stephanie Wood (47) and their son Jess (18) and daughter Madison (22) were all charged with drug possession. Jess's girlfriend Nicole Rips (19) was also arrested. The parents are also facing charges for possessing an illegal weapon.

Neighbor Carlie Padgett told KHOU that she witnessed a strange flow of traffic outside the Wood family's home on Candlepine Drive.

'There would be a skateboarder that would come down our street,' Ms Padgett said. 'He had a bag in his hand and he would throw it in their yard and pick up a bag and skateboard back out.'

She was there on Friday as police searched the home and says she was 'loving it'.

Harris County police received at least two tips on the family from their iWatchHarrisCounty app which allows residents to report possible crimes.

Sergeant Larry Franks said the narcotics unit then developed probably cause to get a search warrant to enter the house where they found 'a quantity of marijuana, cocaine, morphine and Xanax along with several firearms' including a sawed off shotgun and a SKS-762.

But the Wood family denies they did anything wrong, and their lawyer says the search was illegal.

Attorney Sam Adamo said the police didn't have a warrant when they initially searched the house.

The family also has an explanation for the activity at the house and the weapons.

Mr Adamo says Stephanie Wood has leukemia and is forced to work at home where she runs her own e-cigarette business.

Both Stephanie and daughter Madison claim to own a company called 'Bayou A Vape' on Facebook, which sell e-cigarettes in addition to vaporizers which can be used for marijuana consumption.

Family business: Mother and daughter both claim to own a business called 'Bayou A Vape' on Facebook which sells e-cigarettes as well as vaporizers which can be used for marijuana consumption. Stephanie runs the business from home because she is home-bound due to leukemia, according to her attorney

Soldier son: The family says one of the illegal weapons found at the house belonged to a Marine son who had since died. Above, mother and daughter pose at son Chandler's grave

The illegal gun belonged to a Marine son who had died, the family says.

According to information found on their individual Facebook accounts, Stephanie and Raymond have two other sons, Chandler and Chase.

They have pictures of Chandler in his Marine dress uniform as well as pictures taken at his grave site.

Publicity: Father Raymond has several pictures of him and his wife on the cover of magazines. According to his Facebook profile, he runs a flooring store

The family has since posted bail.

Since it was launched in September 2011, the free Harris County iWatch app has received about 1,500 tips a year, leading to the arrest of more than 60 suspects.

Twenty-three per cent of the tips are drug related while the rest are about suspicious persons or activity and quality of life complaints like loud music.Â
