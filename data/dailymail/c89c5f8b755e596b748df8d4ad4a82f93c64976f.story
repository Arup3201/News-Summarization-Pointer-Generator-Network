Premier League 'B' teams could be allowed to play in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy under new plans  discussed at a meeting of Football League clubs.

Walsall are set to play Bristol City in the final of this year's tournament on March 22, but in future second-string sides from the Premier League would be allowed to compete with the 48 League One and Two teams if plans are finalised.

Football League clubs authorised the Football League's executive to push forward with the plans last month, although a formal proposal is yet to be passed.

The Johnstone's Paint Trophy could involve Premier League 'B' teams in future if plans get the go-ahead

Youth squads from the likes of Manchester United and Chelsea could soon be headed for the lower-tier cup

If the Football League do bring 'B' teams into the Johnstone's Paint Trophy, they could adopt a similar format to that suggested by Greg Dyke last year, meaning teams would: 

And in a meeting of AFC Wimbledon's Supporters' Trust, The Dons Trust, it was revealed that only one League Two club voted against the idea - Wimbledon themselves.

FA Chairman Greg Dyke proposed the idea of bringing 'B' teams into the league pyramid itself in June last year but was told that Football League clubs had 'no appetite' for such a move.

However it now seems that they are more keen on introducing the development squads into the JPT in a move that could one day see youth sides from the likes of Manchester United and Chelsea facing each other in a Wembley Stadium show-piece final.

A statement from the Football League clarifying the situation read: 'Clubs have been asked to consider the concept of permitting 16 U21 teams from clubs with category one academies to participate in The Football League Trophy.

'The competition would feature 16 groups of four teams with one U21 team in each group, before a knockout stage leading to a final at Wembley Stadium.

'Given the previous concerns of the League and its clubs about Premier League B teams playing in the pyramid, any final proposal would also be accompanied by a change to the League's Articles of Association that would protect the current 72 club constitution, save for any changes to promotion/relegation that clubs wished to make.

Peterborough manager Darren Ferguson holds the trophy last year - but a youth coach win it in future

'Therefore, having provided them with this comfort, clubs willingly debated the potential commercial, financial and player development benefits of having U21 teams in this competition from 2015/16.

'No formal proposals were tabled and no formal vote taken.

'Instead, League One and Two clubs were asked to indicate whether they were content to see The Football League progress the matter, which would include discussions with the Premier League and Football Association, so that clubs can consider a full proposal at a future point.'
