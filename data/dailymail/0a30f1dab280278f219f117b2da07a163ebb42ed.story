The eBook price of Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs - Amazon's number-one bestseller this year - is higher than the paper edition on Amazon.com, after a deal between publishers to prevent eBook companies discounting without their permission

It's bad news for anyone who has eBook readers such as Amazon's Kindle, Kobo's readers, or Barnes and Noble's Nook sitting under the Christmas tree.

An agreement between six major publishers has seen prices rocket for many books worldwide - some of which are more expensive than the paper version.

The agreement includes major publishing houses such as HarperCollins and Penguin.

The agreement reportedly forbids retailers from discounting eBooks without a publisher's permission.

It's seen a huge surge in 'self-published' books as users of eBook readers turn to cheaper authors to escape rising prices.

In the early days of eBooks, Amazon drove sales of its Kindle eBook reader by discounting heavily - leading readers to see eBooks as a 'bargain' version of their favourite reads.

But that seems no longer to be the case.

Consumers are increasingly angry at being charged more for an electronic version that they can't easily lend out or give away - even 'lending' schemes for eBooks tend to be tightly controlled and difficult to use.

The Kindle edition of this year's eBook bestseller, Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs is $20.76 - the paper one is $17.49.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Ken Follet's novel Fall of Giants was more expensive in an eBook version than it is in a physical version in the U.S. - $18.99 as opposed to $16.50 for the paper edition.

The price for the Kindle Edition has now abruptly fallen to $7.49 - perhaps an indication of the fact that publishers and retailers are sensitive about the pricing issue.

It could be suicidal for the publishing industry - of the top-selling novels on Kindle today, many of the top five are independently published novels such as Blood Guilt by Ben Cheetham ($1.54) and  Ruby Lake by Sherrill Willis ($4.47).

Many of the top 20 are not from major publishers, or available in paperback editions - and books from top publishers are being driven down the charts.

In Europe, the book industry is already under investigation for possible price-fixing - allegedly in collusion with Apple.

The new Amazon Kindle Fire tablet is the latest in Amazon's line of eBook readers - but users may turn to other forms of entertainment after an agreement that has seen prices for electronic books rocket in both the UK and the U.S.

Steve Jobs reportedly did not want Apple's iBook store to compete with Amazon's cheap prices, and helped brokered the deal between publishers.

The European Commission is 
investigating claims that Apple and the five publishing houses worked 
together to keep eBook prices artificially high.

It
 is also suggested that the arrangement killed competition by ensuring 
that Apple’s rivals, such as Amazon and Kobo, could not undercut its 
prices.

The boom in eBooks 
is a goldmine for  publishers and technology firms, because the costs 
are a fraction of those involved in printing, transporting and selling 
books.

Despite the savings, the prices of blockbuster eBooks are often higher than the real thing.

For
 example, Apple’s iTunes store is offering an eBook download of the 
biography of its founder Steve Jobs for £12.99. Amazon charges just 
£11.97 for the hardback version.

Stephen King’s novel 11.22.63 is available for £9.99 as an Apple eBook, compared with £8.20 for the real book from Amazon.

In The UK, the
 Government is partly to blame for the high cost. The Treasury has 
sanctioned an anomaly in the tax system which means VAT is charged at 20
 per cent on eBooks, but is not applied to real books.

The European Commission carried out secret raids on publishers’ offices in March in an attempt to gather evidence.

Yesterday
 it announced a formal investigation to discover whether international 
publishers HarperCollins, Penguin, Hachette Livre, Simon & Schuster 
and Germany’s Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck have ‘engaged in 
anti-competitive practices’.

Officials
 said: ‘The commission will in particular investigate whether these 
publishing groups and Apple have engaged in illegal agreements or 
practices that would have the object or the effect of restricting 
competition.’

A parallel 
lawsuit has been launched against publishers and Apple in the U.S. It 
suggests eBook prices have been inflated by 33 to 50 per cent as a 
result of collusion.

A Pearson spokesman said: ‘Pearson does not believe it has breached any laws.’

Apple declined to comment.
