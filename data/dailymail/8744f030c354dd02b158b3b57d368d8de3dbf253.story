I’d write up the opposition team on a flip chart. One to 15. Then I’d write up the England team. Then I’d eyeball my players. ‘OK, what dressing room do you want to be in? What team sheet would you rather be on?’

It was the England rugby dressing room, but it could also be the England football dressing room with Roy Hodgson addressing his players before this opening World Cup fixture against Italy.

‘You want to be in our dressing room, with Steven Gerrard, with Daniel Sturridge, with Wayne Rooney as your team-mates, or would you rather be on their team sheet?’

Make no mistake, this is a very good Italian team who qualified with two games to spare, but England have nothing to fear.

Roy has to convey that to his players in the moments when an international coach takes to his stage.

The closer to kick-off, the more important his role becomes. What is his body language in the build-up? The players will be watching him. Is he nervous or confident? Does he believe in his team? Do not create any reason for doubt. None at all.

International management is so different to club management. This is the group stages but you must treat it as if it is knockout football and Roy is one-on-one against Cesare Prandelli, the former Roma and Fiorentina coach who is now manager of Italy.

My team had a saying: ‘There is no Monday morning if you lose.’ By that we meant there was a finality about defeat. Routine ended, and there would be no Monday morning meeting. That is what Roy should be telling his players. Win this game and England are in control of their group. Even a 0-0 result against Italy would represent failure, a failure to win and a missed opportunity.

I hope Roy will be telling them: ‘You play for Liverpool, Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City, Everton... but this is England. Some of you may have won titles and Champions League medals, but that was playing for your club. This is the World Cup, this is the whole country. This is England v Italy and this is the biggest game you have ever played in your lives. So let’s prepare and play as if our lives depend on it, let’s really make things happen, go and win it.’

I wouldn’t be playing down this game, I’d be turning it up. Roy should be creating pressure in the team because the greatest athletes love pressure — that is why they do it. The bigger the reward, the greater the fear. The fear of failure is what drives on elite athletes.

In British Cycling, they do not aim for the podium. They only want gold. In my England rugby team, I only wanted players who were there to win the World Cup and who would thrive on the fear of failure. It is a big error for an international coach, dealing with elite players, to play down these moments. Ramp it up. Build on the pressure. Do the opposite of what everyone — including your opponents — will expect. 

It is a fine line and there should not be any illusions. In my dressing room we didn’t have players headbutting the wall or screaming out the national anthem. This might disappoint people outside the dressing room but the reality is far more impressive.

Before playing South Africa in the group stages of the 2003 World Cup, a huge crunch game for us, I recall total focus in the dressing room. This game had been in the back of everyone’s mind for months, just like England v Italy, but there was total understanding and control over the emotion and the magnitude of the task at hand — and the players thrived on it.

Yes, you need your players to keep their discipline and to make the right decisions under pressure, such as not diving into a tackle. But you can also remind your team that the opposition are under pressure, too, and challenge them to create even more pressure.

There are many ways you create pressure but the most effective and easiest is to do everything — and I mean everything — faster than they are used to. Can you make them feel uncomfortable?

Target their weak areas. We saw the Republic of Ireland’s Shane Long worry the Italian defence with his pace and movement in the recent friendly at Craven Cottage and we should look for more of the same. Test them. Yes, your team will be tested, but test them.

One of my favourite expressions in sport is ‘Pressure with Pressure’. No doubt Italy will put us under pressure at times, with the amount of possession they are likely to have and Andrea Pirlo’s ability to pick out a killer pass — but how do we respond when we win the ball back? Turnover is something that we talk about a lot in rugby but it is equally important in football.

The reason why football is the world’s No 1 game is because it is simple. Don’t overcomplicate the tactics, even if there is a temptation to show how clever you are. It is the World Cup and we want to look and play smart. But a smart coach is a winning coach. Get your basics absolutely right — which for me in football are the set-pieces — and go from there.

England are in good shape. They deserve a ‘well done’ for keeping the focus on the football. All anyone is talking about is the line-up and who should play. There is no distraction from the WAGs, no off-field scandals to be ashamed of. They can focus on the challenge ahead. Hodgson should take great credit for that, as it is not easy.

Now, going into a game of this nature, I would pick a team as if my life depended on it. Not a team to come close to victory but a team that would attack for victory. Just naming this team will set the tone of how England will play.

I would look at my rugby team and ask: ‘Do we have the players to score five tries?’ Roy should be  asking: ‘Do we have the players to score three goals?’ If England score three, Italy will have to be very good not to lose.

With that in mind, I would play Ross Barkley and Raheem Sterling, both brilliant attacking players who take the ball forwards, ask questions and force mistakes from opponents with their pace and their ability to run at players. That would increase the pressure on Italy’s players.

I used to have to name my rugby team on a Thursday, two days before the game. But every team I named, I wanted to wake on the day of the game thinking, ‘Wow... I’m excited to watch this team’. I hope Roy arrives at the stadium in Manaus genuinely excited about how this team are going to attack.

I’ve met him a few times and he is great company and someone I can see the players will totally trust. He is experienced and this challenge will not daunt him.

I hope he reads this. I hope he banishes any thought of ‘a draw will do’. Take risks, create the mindset: ‘We must win’. Pick a team to score goals. Erase any negative thoughts about the heat and the jungle conditions and playing slowly. Let’s surprise Italy, give them the unexpected, win the game before the opponents realise they are in a game.

International football can be slow, so make it fast. Liverpool climbed from seventh place to second by stunning opponents and winning games early. They have top players, so do England. England must keep the ball and hurt the opposition, but above everything play with great pace and energy.

Two questions for Roy with the same answer: Has he got the team? Yes. Can England win this? Yes. There is no Monday morning.
