The BBC has admitted its actors were partly to blame for the inaudible dialogue in Jamaica Inn.

The corporation originally said technical faults were responsible after more than 2,000 complaints about ‘incoherent mumbling’ in the drama, shown at Easter.

After an investigation the BBC has now blamed several factors, including the cast failing to deliver their lines clearly.

Many viewers complained that the accents were too difficult to understand and the actors were 'mumbling' on the show featuring Matthew McNulty, left, and Jessica Brown Findlay, right

The ratings fell by more than a million over the course of the three-part drama as viewers singled out stars Sean Harris and Jessica Brown Findlay for particular criticism.

According to the Radio Times, the BBC identified five areas of concern that affected the sound quality, although a spokesman refused to say what they were.

It is thought that on top of mumbling actors, there were problems with the sound levels caused when the audio track was dubbed on to the master tape.

One of the most strident critics of the final result was the drama’s own adapter, Emma Frost, who compared the show to ‘listening through mud’.

She said the sound had been fine in earlier versions seen before transmission, and the BBC said there had been ‘issues with sound levels’.

The BBC confirmed that over the three nights a total of 1,384 viewers complained about the lavish production, pictured, although they did receive some commendations

Viewers particularly found the accent of Sean Harris, rear, who played Joss Merlyn very difficult, with co-star Jessica Brown Findlay, front

But many viewers claimed it was also the fault of the cast.

Some said they were even glad when the Inn’s landlord, played by Harris, was killed in the drama because they had not understood a word he had said.

Previously viewers have criticised actor Eddie Redmayne for mumbling in BBC1’s adaptation of the novel Birdsong.

Others said they could not hear key scenes in historical drama Parade’s End, starring Benedict Cumberbatch.
