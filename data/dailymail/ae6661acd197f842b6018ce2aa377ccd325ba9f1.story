The British Pregnancy Advisory Service said expectant mothers worried about drinking during pregnancy are increasingly demanding abortions

Expectant mothers worried about drinking during pregnancy are increasingly demanding abortions, it emerged yesterday.

Britain's biggest abortion organisation reported 'regular' approaches from women who went binge drinking before they knew they were pregnant and who then fear their babies will be born deformed as a result.

The British Pregnancy Advisory Service called for 'reassurance' from the NHS and medical authorities that occasional binges would not mean an unborn child will be damaged.

The appeal follows years of warnings from medical organisations and the Department of Health that women who drink alcohol during pregnancy can put their baby's health at risk.

One NHS website tells women that even a little bit of alcohol can be damaging and result in defects such as facial deformities, learning difficulties and problems with emotional development.

BPAS carries out 55,000 abortions each year.

Chief executive Ann Furedi said: 'It concerns us greatly when women with wanted pregnancies are driven to consider abortion because they needlessly fear their behaviour has damaged their baby.

'Women should be reassured that the odd night of heavy drinking before they found out they were pregnant is extremely unlikely to have caused their baby harm.'

A report from BPAS said: 'Warnings that even one episode of binge drinking by a pregnant woman can cause lifelong damage to her baby are causing serious and unnecessary distress.

'We are now regularly seeing women so concerned that they have harmed their baby before they knew they were pregnant they consider ending what would otherwise be a wanted pregnancy.'

The report said occasional binge drinking is a 'fact of life' and added: 'Inevitably this means significant numbers of women will have drunk fairly heavily before finding out they were pregnant.

'Warnings that even small quantities of alcohol can lead to birth defects, facial deformities and learning difficulties can cause deep anxiety among this group of women, who are increasingly seeking advice from BPAS about whether to continue or end the pregnancy.'

The organisation gave no figures for numbers of worried women who are making approaches, although it indicated that successive scare stories about the effects of drinking in pregnancy have brought waves of inquiries.

However the BPAS claim that half the pregnancies each year are unplanned means, if correct, that nearly 450,000 women in England and Wales are likely to go through the early days and weeks after conception without knowing they are pregnant.

The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, which publishes detailed advice on drinking for pregnant women, said there is room for reassurance for women with unplanned pregnancies. And the Department of Health is planning to produce new guidelines on alcohol and pregnancy next year.

A spokesman said: 'Our advice is that pregnant women or women trying to conceive should avoid drinking alcohol.

'If they do choose to drink, to minimise the risk to the baby, they should not drink more than one to two units of alcohol once or twice a week and should not get drunk.

'The Chief Medical Officer is currently reviewing all the guidelines for drinking.'

Thousands of babies are being put at risk due to failings in NHS care for pregnant women with diabetes, a report warns.

Many are unwittingly taking ‘hazardous’ medication or have very high blood sugar levels which can harm the unborn child.

Charities blamed a lack of care by specialist diabetes doctors, midwives and GPs who should be helping women control the condition.

Every year just over 3,000 women in England with diabetes give birth – about half have type 2 diabetes, which is linked to obesity, and the other half type 1.

The condition greatly increases the risk of still birth, the baby dying shortly after labour or being born with heart problems or other defects.

A report by the Health and Social Care Information Centre found that babies born to women with diabetes are six times more likely to die shortly after birth than the national average. The infant mortality rate for pregnant women with diabetes is 17 per 1,000 compared with 2.8 per 1,000 for healthy women.

The report, which looked at 1,700 pregnant women, also found one in ten with type 2 diabetes were taking pills to lower blood sugar. Another 5 per cent of all pregnant women with diabetes were on statins and 2.5 per cent were on high blood pressure pills.

Bridget Turner, Diabetes UK director of policy and care improvement, said: ‘Clearly this shows women with diabetes who are pregnant or are considering starting a family are being failed by a system that is not taking their care needs seriously enough.’
