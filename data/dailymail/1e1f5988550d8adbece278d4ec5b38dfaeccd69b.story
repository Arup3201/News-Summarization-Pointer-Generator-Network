Thug: Rex Gardner has been jailed for eight years after he bit off a policeman's ear in a drunken attack

A thug who bit off a policeman’s ear in a drunken attack leaving the officer with life changing injuries has been jailed for eight years.

Police had been called to Rex Gardner's home after a 999 call was made by the 43-year-old's ex-partner following a domestic disturbance.

But when constables Steve Fisher and Daniel Gildersleve arrived at the house in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, Gardner turned on them - hurling PC Fisher into a kitchen table before biting through the top part of his right ear.

PCs Fisher and Gildersleve had arrived at the property at around 11.30pm on August 15 last year, and as they spoke to Gardner to assess what had happened between the couple he became increasingly aggressive.

He had been drinking excessively before police arrived and suddenly become violent, lunging towards PC Fisher, grabbed him around his body armour, knocking over the kitchen table as he did so.

When PC Gildersleve tried to intervene Gardner, 43, hurled a glass vase at him.

As he officers tried to regain control of Gardner and protect his girlfriend, PC Fisher was pulled to the floor.

Gardner then leant in towards PC Fisher and tore off the top part of his right ear with his teeth.

A court heard the officer needed surgery after the attack and was left with a life-long scar.

Gardner had pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of 
causing grievous bodily harm, but was convicted of the more serious 
offence of causing grievous bodily harm with intent after a three 
day trial and was jailed on Monday at St Albans Crown Court.

'This attack was outrageously violent and totally unprovoked,' said Detective inspector Jon Dick following the sentencing.

'PC Fisher and Gilderselve had attended the address to provide support to a vulnerable victim of domestic abuse and the traumatic events of that night I’m sure will live with them for a very long time.

'Gardner is a violent man and the sentence he has been given reflects the severity of his appalling crimes.'

Chief constable Andy Bliss added: 'Everyday officers put themselves at risk to protect the public and this incident is just one example of the dangers faced by frontline staff.

'PC Fisher and Gildersleve acted with bravery in what was an appalling situation.

'The officers had no indication until the last possible moment that they were dealing with such a dangerous offender.

'Their actions and bravery on the night set an outstanding example to colleagues across the force.'

David Lloyd, the Hertfordshire Police and Crime Commissioner said he wanted Gardner to pay for his crimes - both with prison time and financially.

'This has been a disturbing case in which an officer from Hertfordshire Constabulary has suffered serious life-changing injuries that needed long-term medical attention, whilst a second has escaped serious injury,' he said.

'I want to Rex Gardner to pay the financial price for his violent crimes.

'In my police and crime plan Everybody’s Business I talk about offenders paying the costs that they create, particularly where costs could have been avoided by complying with the direction of police officers as with this case.

'I will now be working closely with the Constabulary to identify a way of recovering the cost of wasted police and case preparation time caused directly by the actions of Rex Gardner.'
