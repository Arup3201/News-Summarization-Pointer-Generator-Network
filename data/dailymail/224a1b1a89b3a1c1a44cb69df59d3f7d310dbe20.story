Beaming with joy, Navratilova admitted afterwards that she felt, 'terrified and relieved' after the private ceremony for family and friends.

'It's just really odd,' she told the BBC. 'I'm 58 years old, I got married for the first time – it's about time, right?

'Growing up as a gay woman you just don't ever think about that, and then I thought, about 10 years ago, 'You know, I think within 10 years gay marriage will be legal.' And here we are, 10 years later, making it legal,' she said.

Lemigova, a former Miss USSR who now runs a skin care company said it was a shock. 'I was so overwhelmed and surprised,' she told the British news outlet. 

The couple who have been together since 2006 and Navratilova now has two new roles - wife and mother to Lemigova's two daughters, Victoria, 13, and Emma , 8, from a previous relationship.

Navratilova said her wife's younger daughter had been badgering her to propose to her mother all year before she famously proposed while the television cameras were rolling at this year's U.S. Open in September.

The tennis legend was being interviewed in the Tennis Channel suite when she turned to Lemigova and said she would be asking the questions this time. 

Navratilova, who has 18 Grand Slam titles to her name, got down on one knee and offered her a diamond-studded ring. 

'Originally it wasn't the idea to do it at the U.S. Open, on the Jumbotron and all that, but then it was, 'Why not? I've seen it in movies!' ' Navratilova told PEOPLE afterward. 'And it all came off, everything worked out perfectly!'

The engagement was even broadcast on the Jumbotron at New York's Arthur Ashe stadium and the crowd roared as they watched.

'But by proposing and marrying in such a public I way I hope we'll give inspiration to families like ours, that they too can be married legally one day,' said Lemigova, who runs a skin care company.

Navratilova, who came out as gay in 1981,has had difficult relationships with ex-girlfriends Toni Layton and former Miss Texas Judy Nelson who both went to court and won multi-million-dollar settlements from her after making claims to a large share of her fortune 

Lemigova was at the tennis star's side when she successfully fought off breast cancer in 2010.
