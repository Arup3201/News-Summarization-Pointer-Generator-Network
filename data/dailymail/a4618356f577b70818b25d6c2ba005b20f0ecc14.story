Hundreds today used their Bank Holiday Monday to pay tribute to murdered soldier Lee Rigby by laying yet more flowers, balloons and hand-written notes at the spot where he died in Woolwich.

Many sobbed as they came to see the stream of tributes that now runs the whole length of the street where the 25 year old Drummer was executed as he walked to his barracks last Wednesday.

Meanwhile 10 miles across London more than 1,000 English Defence League supporters waved placards that read 'Blood on your hands' and 'GB RIP', as well as singing 'There's Only One Lee Rigby', and some anti-Muslim songs as they marched in his memory.

They snarled at United
 Against Fascism supporters, with both groups largely kept apart by 
police as they both protested on Whitehall, close to Downing Street.

Witnesses said that both groups then began to throw dozens of glass bottles at each other.

Earlier the EDL demonstrators pushed their way through a police cordon as they made their way to Trafalgar Square.

They
 chanted 'Muslim killers off our streets' and 'There’s only one Lee 
Rigby' and protesters held placards that read 'Blood on your hands' and 
'GB RIP'.

EDL leader Tommy Robinson told the demonstration: 'This is a day of respect for our Armed Forces.'

The crowd repeatedly chanted 'coward' after he claimed Prime Minister David Cameron was on holiday 'because he doesn't care'.

Mr Robinson added: 'They've had their Arab Spring. This is time for the English Spring.'

Chanting: English Defence League supporters wore Union Jacks and flew England flags as they called David Cameron a 'coward' for going on holiday after the Woolwich terror attack

Making themselves heard: Defence League demonstrators chant anti-Muslim messages during a protest in the sunshine in Whitehall

Faces of fury: Protestors with the English Defence League gathered outside Downing Street. Leaders said the protest was a celebration of the armed Forces

Aggression: Police had prepared for an aggressive protest following the shoicking killing of British soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich last Wednesday

A
 group of United Against Fascism supporters staged a 
counter-protest at the same time and were penned in by the Met Police to
 avoid ugly clashes.

Violence broke out when about 100 anti-fascists mobbed five protestors who were arriving to join the march draped in Union Jacks and wearing England football shirts.

Police filmed the anti-EDL protesters as they chanted 'fascist scum off our streets' and 'follow your leader, kill yourself like Adolf Hitler' before escorting the EDL supporters around Parliament Square.

The demonstrators marched through 
Admiralty Arch and onto Parliament Square. They were escorted by 
Metropolitan Police officers and vans, while a force helicopter followed
 overhead.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said Whitehall was closed to traffic because of 'a number of demonstrations'.

Tensions have also increased in
 certain communities where thugs have been attacking mosques in 
retaliation for the murder of Lee Rigby.

A Grimsby mosque was last night hit with petrol bombs, while people were inside, including children.

Chairman
 Diler Gharib said: 'We had just finished our prayers and were 
discussing how to thank our neighbours for the support they have shown 
us over the past few days when we heard a bang and saw fire coming under
 the door.

Backlash: A counter-protest, staged by United against Fasciam, led to violence when 100 anti-fascists mobbed protestors who were joining the EDL march

Distressed: Unite Against Fascim demonstrators (left and right) pitted themselves against EDL marchers. Police worked to keep the two groups apart outside Downing Street

Making their point: Unite Against Fascism demonstrators shout across police lines at EDL protesters

'I grabbed a 
fire extinguisher and put it out and then two more petrol bombs hit the 
fire escape and the bin so I had to put those out too.

'Luckily
 the police have been monitoring the mosque since the last attack and 
they were able to arrest two people almost straight away.

'We
 have all been feeling on edge and now this has happened. It’s not just 
the people at the mosque we are worried about, it’s our wives, daughters
 and children who are out in the community.

'People
 need to realise that the people who committed the murder in Woolwich 
are criminals and it had nothing to do with the Muslim faith.'

Two men, aged 33 and 37, have been arrested after yesterday's attack and are still in police custody.

Four boys, aged 15 and 16, were arrested after a separate attack on Thursday and were released on bail until the end of June.

Chief
 Supt Tony Forbes said today: 'I would like to remind people that these 
are serious offences which are being investigated and those who are 
responsible will be brought to justice.

'It is important to remember that 
those people who have committed these offences are a very small minority
 and they do not reflect the vast majority of people who live in North 
East Lincolnshire.

'The 
people who want to engage themselves in this type of criminal activity 
will be dealt with using all appropriate police resources and powers.

Control: Police officers walk members of the English Defence League protest as they march from Trafalgar Square

Standing guard: Police cordoned protestors off today, in an attempt to keep the protest peaceful

On the run: Police officers move into position as they react to English Defence League members marching

Should David Cameron have gone on holiday as Britain deals with terror crisis?

'I
 have spoken to community leaders and what is clear to me is the attacks
 will not be allowed to undermine the very good community relations in 
North East Lincolnshire.

'My officers will continue to work with all of our communities to protect them and ensure their safety.'

On Saturday night riot police were called to stop a ‘Help for Heroes’ walk over fears it would turn violent.

Officers carrying shields and batons brought a halt to the parade in Bristol after they received reports of planned trouble.

Marchers
 said they were raising money for the armed forces charity but internet 
rumours claimed  facist group the English Defence League was also 
taking part.

Police stopped the walk outside a pub - sparking a five hour stand-off which saw up to 40 people barricade themselves inside.

Riot police, vans and horses attended on Saturday evening as an operation was launched to contain the group.

Scotland Yard said three arrests had been made during the protest and counter-protest outside Downing Street.

EDL members congregated after their march in Leicester Square, central London.

As one youth was taken away by police, the crowd began throwing bottles at them.

One
 officer was hit on the head with a glass bottle and the mob followed 
the officers, chanting "who the f*** is Allah?" before being pushed back
 towards the square.

Skirmishes
 broke out around the square, with several men threatening a youth 
wearing a Palestinian scarf with a stick before police intervened.

As
 the two groups arrived towards Westminster Tube station, the 
anti-fascists began to run towards the men, forcing the police to set up
 a cordon to protect them.

Officers say there were 19 arrests and 12 people were later charged with public order offences and five remanded in custody.

Meanwhile an English Defence 
League activist who threatened to burn down a mosque in retaliation for 
Lee Rigby's murder has been told he faces jail.

Adam
 Rodgers took to Facebook following the murder and called on his fellow 
EDL members to meet him at a mosque in Hastings, Sussex.

Attack: This scorched door to the Grimsby Mosque shows the damage caused by the firebomb attack last night

Upsetting: The spray paint has been used to scrub out the inscription on the tribute to the animals which helped keep Britain free

Attack: The Bomber Command Memorial in Green Park, London, was also targeted in the past 24 hours and was then covered in black plastic and guarded by police

The
 28-year-old posted various 'inflammatory' remarks on the social 
networking site in the hours following the drummer's death including 
'the mosque needs burning down'.

Lead
 magistrate Paul Brown, told him: 'The harm you could have created was 
potentially huge due to the circumstances.

'You made threats to burn down
 a mosque and mobilise people at a time when feelings are running very 
high due to a tragic incident. All options will remain open, including 
prison.'

Two
 of Britain's most celebrated war memorials have been defaced, 
apparently with the word 'Islam' scrawled across them and inscriptions 
scrubbed out with red paint.

Police have confirmed they are 
investigating the vandalism of the RAF Bomber Command Memorial in Green 
Park and the Animals In War Memorial in Park Lane, both in central 
London.

Pictures taken today show that the damage has now been covered over with plastic or white sheets.

Scotland Yard said there have not been 
any arrests, so it not clear if it has been done by Muslim protesters or far-right 
groups attempting to stir-up hatred.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said:
 'At 5am this morning police discovered graffiti on both the RAF Bomber 
Command War Memorial in Green Park and the Animals in War Memorial on 
Park Lane.

Scene: Police and firefighters attend the blaze started by troublemakers at a Grimsby mosque last night

Problems: Hoards of police were forced to break up the walk in Bristol because of disorder

Trouble: Riot officers were called to halt a Bristol walk in support of Help for Heroes after they feared it would stoke up 'community tensions' - this led to 19 arrests

'Royal Parks' officers and Westminster police are investigating. There have been no arrests at present.'

The Bomber Command Memorial remembers
 the sacrifice and bravery of the 55,573 RAF crew who lost their lives 
in the Second World War and was unveiled by the Queen last summer.

Just
 last week Dame Judi Dench described herself as being 'very proud' to be
 the first patron of a new campaign to preserve it for generations to 
come.

The
 Animals in War Memorial is 'a powerful and moving tribute to all the 
animals that served, suffered and died alongside the British, 
Commonwealth and Allied forces in the wars and conflicts of the 20th 
century', according to the Animals in War Fund website.

The monument was unveiled by the Princess Royal in November 2004 - the 90th anniversary of the start of World War I.

The
 fund's website says the £2 million needed to build the monument came 
from 'a national appeal and the generosity of many individual donors, 
charities and companies'.
