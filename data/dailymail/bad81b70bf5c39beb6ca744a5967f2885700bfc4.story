Rebuilding his life: Ian McNicholl is to have cosmetic surgery to treat scars left after he was the victim of violence from a former girlfriend

A businessman who was beaten so badly by his 5ft 1ins girlfriend that he almost lost his arm is to have cosmetic surgery to heal his horrific scars.

Ian McNicholl, 49, from Hull, suffered two years of abuse at the hands of Michelle Williamson, including one attack where she sprayed bleach in his eyes.

He also suffered fractures to his skull, cheekbones, and nose, three cracked ribs and horrific burns on his arm from an iron at the hands of his ex-girlfriend.

Williamson, who is now serving a seven-year jail sentence for causing grievous bodily harm, also lit cigarettes and shoved them up her partner’s nose after falsely accusing him of having an affair.

On one occasion, she also poured two kettles full of boiling water over him - and even attacked him with a vacuum cleaner.

Ian, who is now preparing for the surgery, said: 'It was between Christmas and New Year (in 2006) when she first accused me of having an affair with one of her friends.

'This was the first time she lashed out. She punched me in the face and I had a black eye.'

Williamson begged him for forgiveness, saying it was just a one off and a soon moved into his flat in Grimsby.

However a few weeks later she launched another attack with the vacuum cleaner.

Ian recalled: 'She began ranting and raving about previous partners of mine.

'Then, all of a sudden, she switched the vacuum cleaner off, grabbed the nozzle and whacked me across the face with it. I could feel my cheek split.'

This was the first of many outbursts of domestic violence from the then 34-year-old and the attacks got progressively worse.

His worst ordeal came when Williamson poured a kettle full of 
boiling water into his lap and, while he was screaming in agony, she
 reboiled the kettle and poured it over him again.

He continued: 'She would show off my injuries to her friends.

'I felt as though I couldn’t walk away, because she told me she had family who were involved in organised crime who would kill me if I left her. I felt I was trading with my life.

I was brought up well and taught never to hit a woman - and I didn’t lay a finger on her.'

The night before Michelle’s arrest, Ian endured an attack that lasted almost seven hours, where he was beaten with a metal bar and his body smashed in places with a claw hammer.

An anonymous phone call tipped off the police, who took Ian to Hull Royal Infirmary and arrested Michelle.

Although the violence had come to an end, Ian didn’t realise the aftermath would be just as bad.

He woke up the following day to find himself in a night shelter for the homeless, wearing his bloodstained clothes from the day before.

He said: 'Michelle had taken control of my finances and run up lots of debt. I didn’t have any money and didn’t know where to go or what to do.

'I was petrified walking the streets of Hull, as I was paranoid her brothers were going to come and kill me. As it turns out, they didn’t exist, but I didn’t know that at the time.'

After a phone call to the Salvation Army, he was given accommodation at William Booth Life House, where he stayed for 18 months, and he received psychological help and support from The Men’s Helpline.

No, Ian has dedicated his life to helping the homeless - being appointed vice-chairman of Hull’s Homelessness Focus Group.

He added: 'I can completely understand why some men will feel embarrassed speaking out - men generally don’t like talking about their feelings.

'But the bigger issue is that lots of men don’t know where to go for help and there’s a lot of gender bias.

'The massive problem is that men are not seen as victims. We need a gender neutral awareness campaign, or even a male-specific one.'

Despite his experience, Ian isn’t put off having a relationship again.

'It’s going to be difficult when I meet someone who doesn’t know what I’ve been through,' said Ian.

'They will no doubt ask about my scars, and I’m not going to lie. My fear is that they will wonder what I did to deserve it.'
