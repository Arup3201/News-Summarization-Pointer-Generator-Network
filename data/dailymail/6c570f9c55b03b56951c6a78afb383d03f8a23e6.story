These pictures from the Iraqi city of Mosul show dozens of ISIS militants abseiling off a motorway bridge as traffic trundles past.

The troubling scene from the terrorist group's largest stronghold shows cars and buses calmly passing by as the fighters lower each other on to the middle of the road.

The pictures, taken in central Mosul, also show scores of the masked fighters carrying assault rifles, but commuters driving past the the terror group members seem to be used to the worrying sight.

Dozens of fighters from the terror group took part in the training drill in the Iraqi city on Sunday

Today's military drill follows days of massacres by ISIS across Iraq and Syria, which have become commonplace in areas held by the terror group as it imposes a severe form of sharia law.

The extremists lined up and shot dead at least 50 tribesmen, women and children in Iraq's Anbar province, officials said today.

The latest mass killing by the militant group against a Sunni tribe took place in the village of Ras al-Maa, north of Ramadi.

There, the militant group killed at least 40 men, six women and four children, lining them up and publicly killing them one by one, Sheikh Naim al-Gaoud, a senior figure in the targeted Al Bu Nimr tribe, said. 

The training exercise follows weeks of mass killings across ISIS controlled areas of Iraq and Syria

Militants from the ISIS have intensified attacks in Anbar province recently, killing hundreds of people in Sunni tribes

Pictured are the bodies of 30 men from the Anbar province, west of Baghdad, who were executed on Thursday

Another 17 people were kidnapped by ISIS, he added.

This took the number of people in the tribe killed by the terror group close to 300.

Yesterday, in Syria, grim pictures emerged showing ISIS supporters encouraging a baby to kick the severed head of a dead soldier.

The father can be seen smiling with delight in the photo as he watches his innocent child kick the severed head.

It appears to be the head of a dead prisoner, although it is hard to distinguish his features due to the heavy decomposition of the face.

The face has also suffered a deep wound, suggesting the victim had been mulitated with a knife. 

A shocking photo has emerged showing a suspected ISIS supporter encouraging a toddler to kick the severed head of a dead soldier 

Earlier today Unesco chief Irina Bokova slammed the 'barbaric' destruction of Iraq's cultural heritage, as ISIS jihadists destroy age-old sites in areas they control.

Iraq has 'thousands of temples, of buildings, of archaeological sites, of objects, that represent a treasure for (all) humanity,' Bokova said during a visit to Baghdad, Iraq.

'We cannot agree that this treasure, that this legacy of human civilisation, is being destroyed in the most barbaric matter,' she said.

'We have to act, we don't have time to lose, because extremists are trying to erase the identity, because they know that if there is no identity, there is no memory, there is no history, and we think this is appalling and this is not acceptable.'
