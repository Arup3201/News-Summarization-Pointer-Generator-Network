Will Brazil win the World Cup without Neymar?

Neymar was given a hero's welcome by his Brazil team-mates after he was ruled out of the rest of the World Cup with a back injury.

The 22-year-old flew back to Rio de Janeiro with his team-mates after Friday's 2-1 quarter final victory over Colombia.

And before he boarded an ambulance, which took him to the team's camp in the mountain city of 
Teresopolis, there were emotional scenes on the Rio tarmac.

Neymar - sat in a wheelchair - was wished well by his team-mates with a number of stars, such as Thiago Silva 
and David Luiz, clearly overwhelmed by the situation in footage 
released by the Brazilian FA.

It was not immediately clear if Neymar 
would remain with the rest of the team as they prepare for Tuesday's 
World Cup semi-final against Germany in Belo Horizonte. The squad isn't 
expected to leave the training camp until Monday.

The shocking extent of Neymar's back injury has also been revealed after an image of his broken vertebra surfaced.

Neymar
 was kneed by Colombia defender Juan Camilo Zuniga late in the second 
half of Brazil's 2-1 win over Colombia in Fortaleza on Friday.

And an X-ray shown on Brazilian TV reveals the striker suffered a clean break of his vertebra.

The injury rules Neymar out of the rest 
of the World Cup and will keep him sidelined for four weeks but he is 
not expected to need surgery, according to the Brazilian FA.  

Tributes poured in for the Neymar, with the likes of Mesut Ozil, Lionel Messi and Mario Balotelli wishing the striker well. Neymar's Barcelona team-mate Messi wrote on his Facebook page:  'Neymar, I hope you recover very soon friend!'

Neymar - the poster boy of the World Cup - was hurt in the 86th minute, falling to the ground in pain after Zuniga jumped into him from behind.

He was carried off the field in tears on a stretcher and 'screamed in pain in the dressing room' before being taken to the hospital. Images show Neymar on a drip as he arrives at the hospital.

Bittersweet: The elation at the victory was soon dampened as news filtered through of Neymar's injury

Neymar has fractured his third lumbar vertebra, revealed Brazil team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar.

In other words, he has fractured part of his spine. He will not, however, need surgery and is expected back in four weeks.

The injury will restrict Neymar's movements in the early part of his recovery.

There are five lumbar vertebrae between the rib cage and the pelvis and they help support the weight of the body and allow movement.

Crowds of Brazilian fans swelled outside 
the Sao Carlos Hospital in Fortaleza as news filtered through that their
 hero had been taken there.

Zuniga said: 'It was a normal move. I 
never meant to hurt a player. I was on the field, playing for the shirt 
from my country, not without the intent to injure. I was just defending 
my shirt.'

'Everybody knew that Neymar would be hunted,' Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said after the game. 'It's been happening in the last three matches and we had been talking about it. But nobody listens to us.'

Friday's match ended with 54 fouls in total - 31 by Brazil and 23 by Colombia. Scolari said Spanish referee Carlos Velasco Carballo should have done more to take control of the match.

According to Brazilian striker Hulk, Neymar needs more protection from the officials. 'Every time is like this. Players always come after Neymar,' Hulk said. 'The referees need to do more to keep this from happening.'

Silva had opened the 
scoring in the first half before Luiz's bullet free kick doubled 
Brazil's advantage after the break.

James Rodriguez pulled a goal back from the spot with 10 minutes remaining but Jose Pekerman's side could not find an equaliser.

Brazil will already be without the suspended Silva for the last-four showdown in Belo Horizonte.
