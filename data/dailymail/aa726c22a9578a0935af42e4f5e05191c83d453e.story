Once a universally acknowledged style disaster - and only sported by pensioners on the beach - the sandals and socks look has made a resurgence lately, thanks to celebrities such as David Beckham and Justin Bieber.

However, it appears the nation is still unconvinced: wearing socks with your sandals has just been voted the biggest fashion faux pas of all time in a poll carried out by Debenhams.

Zero socks appeal: Style icons David Beckham and Justin Bieber may love the look, but the rest of us loathe it...

Ed Watson, spokesperson for the store, said: 'Socks and sandals are the epitome of British summer style gone wrong.

'The fashion crowd might have classed it as en vogue but our customers have voted it the worst look of all time.'

Other fashion catastrophes on the list include platforms on men (sorry, Tom Cruise)  and low-slung trousers, as well as 80s horrors such as shell suits and bum bags.

Crop tops also appeared in the top ten - even though they've been all over the red carpet for a while now.

Watson explained: 'It might look chic on a catwalk, but this isn’t a look that many of us want to see on our local High Streets.'

Crop flop: Belly-baring tops, like those worn by Cara Delevigne and Rita Ora, were voted one of the most hated styles

In fact, quite a few of the top ten most hated styles have been adopted of late by the fashion crowd. Model of the moment Cara Delevigne is a serial offender. Trucker cap? Check. Crop top? Yep. Low-slung trousers? Tick. She's worn them all.

She even appeared in a campaign for accessories brand My Crazy Scrunchie in December last year - the hair ties came in at number ten on the list.

So what are we to conclude? Well, that only ridiculously beautiful under-25s - and David Beckham - should attempt to get away with wearing clothes quite so hideous...

Crime against fashion: Sadly for boho babes Vanessa Hudgens and Eva Mendes, gypsy-style skirts are also considered beyond the pale
