It’s the game on many-a-young-person’s wish list. And for those who can’t wait for its release on next-gen consoles, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes has finally arrived on their rickety older brothers.

But don’t expect to be punished for your impatience – for TT Games have squeezed every last drop of processing power from the aging Xbox 360 and PS3 to create their best-looking LEGO game to date.

Hectic: for the most part, the game engine performs well - but on larger sections there can be some slowdown

Plot sees Doctor Doom teaming up with Loki to build a super-weapon from cosmic bricks, and it’s up to the Marvel team to stop them.

But where LEGO Batman 2 DC Super Heroes held a lot of the playable characters back to the latter parts of the game, here you’re exposed to many playable heroes early on.

From Spiderman, Thor, Hulk and Iron Man to the Fantastic Four and X-Men, it’s certainly an eclectic mix, but one that works surprisingly well.

True to its roots: all of the characters are instantly recognisable

All stay true to their comic-book roots, and while some characters have abilities in common, every one has their own distinct animation and special ability.

Whereas Spiderman can use his web to swing around and bind objects together, Thor can use his lightening to charge devices. And so forth.

These come in handy when solving the game’s numerous puzzles – with certain characters’ abilities needed to complete each one.

It takes two: co-operative mode makes a comeback and there is a wide variety of Heroes to choose from

It’s a tried and tested formula, and one that TT has long used in their LEGO games. But even though there is a slight whiff of this design starting to become stale, the open-world second part of the game more than makes up for it.

Here you are given free range of Manhattan, tasked with numerous side-missions – such as checkpoint races - and unlocking new characters.

It’s noticeably more populated and alive than in LEGO Batman 2, and it is backed up with mostly vibrant visuals. Sadly, though, the camera can prove an annoyance – especially when flying and playing through latter stages with a friend. Characters can get wedged in the environment, too.

Thinking games: puzzles usually require a combination of multiple Super Hero powers to solve them

Flaws aside, TT Games have delivered another brilliant LEGO game.

It may not be a radical change from the other outings – and maybe it’s time to try something new – but for now, it’s the best LEGO game yet. Just Marvel-ous.

Version tested: Xbox 360
