With questions still unanswered whether missing MH370 was sabotaged, Special Branch police in Kuala Lumpur today began a sabotage inquiry into a drama involving another Malaysian Airlines jet.

Police Chief Halid Abu Bakar confirmed that an investigation had begun into whether flight MH192, which had to turn back to Kuala Lumpur while flying to India, had been interfered with before take off.

The Boeing 737-800 aircraft, with 166 people on board, landed safely in Kuala Lumpur after a tyre burst and the right hand landing gear malfunctioned.

Fears: Police have confirmed they are investigating whether flight MH192, which had to turn back to Kuala Lumpur while flying to India, was interfered with before take off

Relief: After the incident Malaysia's Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein posted this picture on Twitter as he met the passengers off the plane, adding: 'Their faces says it all (sic)... Thank God they are safe'

Safe: Passengers of flight MH192 were relieved to step off the aircraft after an emergency landing

As passengers praised the pilot for 
the safe landing, Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein 
demanded that the police begin an investigation into the incident.

Inspector
 General of Police Mr Bakar then announced that a thorough investigation
 would be carried out to establish if there were 'elements of sabotage' 
involved in the emergency.

Mr
 Hishammuddin, who has been a central figure in the investigation into 
the disappearance of MH730, has given Malaysian Airlines just two days 
to furnish the Malaysian cabinet with a preliminary report into the 
incident.

After the incident he posted a picture on Twitter as he met 
the passengers off the plane and reflected: 'Their faces says it all 
(sic)... Thank God they are safe'.

The aircraft had to conduct a turn-around during a routine 90-minute flight to Bangalore and make an emergency landing back at Kuala Lumpur airport three hours after take-off.

The Minister said the airline did not have a reason to be unable to provide an early report into the incident.

The Department of Civil Aviation has also been asked to provide cabinet with a report as soon as possible, said the Minister.

'Such
 incidents should not have happened,' said Mr Hishammuddin, despite the 
aircraft, piloted by Captain Nor Adam Azmi Abdul Razak and co-pilot 
Prakash Kumar, landing safely.

'This
 is why I have asked the DCA and the police Special Branch to conduct a 
review on the national carrier's standard operating procedures 
concerning their flights.'

Despite
 his apparent deep concerns, he praised the pilots and cabin crew for 
showing 'outstanding leadership' in handling the ordeal.

'I
 am very proud of the pilots and crew members who kept the passengers 
informed and calm until the aircraft landed without incident,' he said.

Passengers on the flight also praised the pilot for doing a 'good job' in landing the plane safely. Several said they knew there was something wrong with the plane after a bumpy take-off

But
 the Minister said he did not discount the possibility of sabotage 
following incidents that have struck the national carrier in recent 
weeks.

He
 was referring to two emergency landings of other Malaysian Airlines 
planes - one in Hong Kong and the other in Kathmandu - and the 
prevailing mystery of MH370.

Passengers on the flight also praised the pilot for doing a 'good job' in landing the plane safely.

Several
 said they knew there was something wrong with the plane after a 
particularly bumpy take-off, although the cabin crew were able to keep 
everybody calm.

Marta
 Alonso, a Spanish citizen travelling to Bangalore to star a new hob as a
 telecommunications engineer, said she knew something was not right as 
soon as the plane took off.

'It
 was bumpy and shaky. Not long after that the pilot announced we needed 
to make an emergency landing. It was frightening,' she said.

Australian
 national Maslahuddin Khan, 40, also praised the pilot: 'There was 
turbulence during the departure but the landing procedure was handled 
well. We panicked at first but all remained calm.'

The
 malfunction came nearly two months after Maylasia Airlines lost flight 
MH370, which mysteriously vanished en route to Beijing.

Hunt: The disappearance last month of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has prompted a multinational search effort, which is now focused on the Indian Ocean

'New plans': Over the weekend Malaysia's defence minister gave a deadline of today before a new approach would need to be taken in the ongoing search for MH370

The
 Boeing 777 has still yet to be found, despite weeks of extensive 
searches in the southern Indian Ocean where it was ruled to have 
crashed, killing all 239 people on board.

Aircraft
 and ships continued to search the Indian Ocean north west of Perth 
today, while the Bluefin-21 underwater search vehicle scoured the ocean 
bed.

But, as in previous days, searchers have failed to find any clue to the whereabouts of the aircraft.

Over
 the weekend Malaysia's defence minister gave a deadline of today before
 new plans would need to be made regarding the ongoing search for MH370.

On Saturday Mr Hishammuddin 
Hussein, who is also the country's Acting Transport Minister, said it 
was his understanding 'that the search effort is entering a critical 
stage in the next 48 hours'.

'Whatever happens in that period, we will then regroup and discuss our next move.'

Mr
 Hisammuddin was speaking in Kuala Lumpur as the underwater drone 
Bluefin-21 was sent on its seventh mission 1500 miles north west of 
Perth, Western Australia, to search for any sign of the wreckage of the 
Boeing 777 aircraft.

The
 Minister's reference to just 48 hours revealed less optimism than 
comments by Australia's Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, who had forecast 
that the search would continue at least until the end of this week.
