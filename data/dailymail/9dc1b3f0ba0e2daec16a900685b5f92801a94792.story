On the football pitch Thierry Henry was famous for his ability to exploit even the smallest weakness in the most fearsome defence and find the back of the net.

And now it seems the same can be said for his off-field prowess after the ex-Arsenal player scored a last-minute winner over opponents of his dream home.

Local planners have given the green-light to the French international’s plans to demolish his £6million mansion in order to rebuilt it with a giant three-storey fish tank.

Actor Tom Conti, who is a neighbour of Henry's in Hampstead, north London, had led the attack.

But the star skilfully defended the plan in documents presented to council bosses.

And Camden council’s planning 
committee voted nine to two in favour of Henry in the final few moments 
of a meeting that lasted for more than three hours.

Henry - the Gunners’ record goalscorer who now plays for the New York Red Bulls - did not attend the meeting.

Camden councillor Jonathan Simpson 
described the designs as ‘fantastic’, adding: ‘It is an outstanding 
contribution to the borough.’

Flash home: Conti, whose garden backs on to 
Henry's home, and seven others have urged planning officials halt the 
proposal saying 'If someone wants a larger house why do they not just 
buy one somewhere else?'

larger house to accommodate a monster 40ft fish tank

Mr Henry, 34, will now go ahead with 
demolishing his current house and replace it 
with the new design that will have a £250,000 fish tank holding 5,500 
gallons of water.

Conti, the 70-year-old actor best known for his portrayal of Greek taverna owner Costas in the film Shirley Valentine, claimed the building of the house would cause massive disruption and was not suited to the area.

Henry argues that his house, built in 1999, has aged badly and is not fit for purpose as a family home.

‘Its interior spaces are cramped, 
deteriorated and commercial in feel, with low ceilings, narrow rooms and
 poor daylight,’ according to papers submitted to the council by Montagu
 Evans, the agents acting on his behalf.

The row in leafy Hampstead has been brewing since February, when French footballer Henry applied for planning permission.

Plans: Henry intends to rebuild his Hampstead home, although the original architect Sir Richard MacCormac is opposed to the demolition

Made up of four separate containers, 
one for each storey of the house, his proposed £250,000 tank would take 
5,500 gallons of water to fill, house 300 fish and cost £12,000 a year 
to run, making the super-size aquariums owned by the likes of Madonna, 
the Beckhams and Premier League footballer Stephen Ireland look like 
tiddlers.

 The French footballer – who fronted 
the ‘va-va-voom’ TV adverts for car firm Renault – is the latest in a 
long line of celebrities to take an interest in flashy fish tanks.

Madonna, the Beckhams, Cher and 
Premier League footballers Stephen Ireland, Joe Hart and Micah Richards, have all splashed out on opulent fish tanks.

Ireland has reportedly spent more 
than £100,000 on his 13ft aquarium, and is now believed to be planning a
 shark tank under his kitchen floor.

It has been suggested that the celebrity obsession with aquariums may not be just about a fondness for fish.

One tank designer, who asked not to be
 named, said: ‘Our client list tends to be male-dominated and they are 
looking for status symbols and showpieces.’

Henry bought his house in 2001 when he was married to model Claire Merry. The couple divorced in 2007.

But he is understood to be keen to 
maintain his London base to be close to their young daughter, Tea. His 
new home would also include a swimming pool and gym.

Henry’s new home is expected to take 
about six months to complete.

Before news of the successful planning application Mr Conti said: ‘They’ll be drilling into the basement and it’ll go on for months and months.

'There are a lot of retired people round here or people like me who work from home – I write – and it’s a terrible disturbance.‘Why do they have to knock it down? I’ve never met Thierry Henry and I’ve got nothing against the man at all. I’m sure he’s a very nice man and he’s welcome to build whatever he likes. But please not here, not next to me, with all the noise.’

Conti added: ‘This used to be a wonderful place to live, but in the last ten years there’s been endless, endless building.’They’ll be drilling into the basement and 
it’ll go on for months and months.

Trading is only permitted under strict Government regulations.

The house’s original architect, Sir 
Richard MacCormac, a former chairman of the Royal Institute of British 
Architects, opposed Henry’s application.

He said the house has ‘good daylighting and is in good condition but appears not to have been well maintained’.

Influential civic group the Heath and 
Hampstead Society had also called for the application to be thrown out, 
saying the design of the new house ‘has no style or elegance’.
