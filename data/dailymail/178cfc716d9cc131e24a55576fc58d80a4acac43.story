A disgruntled commuter has hit back at delays on First Capital Connect trains by disfiguring a picture of the group CEO's face every time his service is late.

Oli Beale has decided to vent his frustration at the company's late-running services by altering an image of CEO Tim O'Toole - who is the boss of parent company First Group.

He then posts his surreal and bizarre creations to a Tumblr blog called Tim's Faces.

Oli Beale has hit out at delays on First Capital Connect trains by altering a picture of the group CEO Tim O'Toole every time his service is late. Above is Mr O'Toole, who is head of parent group First, as he looks usually and his face superimposed onto that of EastEnders actress Pam St. Clement as character Pat Butcher

Mr Beale then posts the images on to his Tumblr blog - which is called Tim's Faces. In one (left) the CEO's head has evidently been squashed and right, he appears with no hair

In one of the images (left) the CEO's facial features have been removed - with rather disconcerting results - while in another Mr O'Toole's face is plastered all over his suit

Mr Beale also Photoshopped Mr O'Toole on to the front page of Hello! Magazine (left) and took a picture of his face merged with the bottom half of the Queen's head as it appears on a bank note

In most of the posts, Mr Beale also includes which service - and how long it was delayed - under the image.

The blog already contains hundreds of altered images and GIFs - including one of the CEO transformed in to Pat Butcher, another of him on the front cover of Hello! magazine and even one of Mr O'Toole looking very like singer Susan Boyle.

On the blog, Mr Beale - who works in marketing - explains why he decided to take the unique approach to making a complaint about the company.

In a post which is addressed to the CEO, Mr Beale writes: 'Every time my train is delayed I’m going to edit your face. Why? Because you are the CEO of ‘First’ and therefore ultimately responsible for the train line ‘First Capital Connect.’ I want you to understand that little delays matter.

'It’s an awful train line, Tim. It really is. Don’t get me wrong, Tim there have been times I’ve seriously questioned myself over this. I’m aware that this is not normal behaviour.

Mr O'Toole also appears as Homer Simpson on the blog (left) and in another his head is replaced by a shrimp

The CEO's face is turned upside down (left) and in another he has green skin like the Incredible Hulk and 'I love train' written on his forehead

In another (left) the CEO has bulging eyes and a mustache, while in another he sports a rather fat-looking lip

Mr Beale includes some Gifs in his collection - such as this one of the CEO looking like Space Invaders

'I have to hide my screen from other commuters while I’m doing ‘my work’.  Once I spent two hours making you a little suit made out of repeating patterns of your face. You have to ask yourself some serious questions when you find yourself doing a thing like that.

'The thing is, Tim, it helps me get through the stress of the journey. Editing your face is very cathartic.'

He continues: 'So, what’s my beef with First Capital Connect? To start with, the trains are pretty rubbish. You have to admit. Old. Knackered. A bit smelly. There is NEVER a seat on the way home after work and sometimes there isn’t one on the way in. Have you ever stood up from London to Brighton, Tim?

'I’ve seen things you people wouldn’t believe. Men in tears at Norwood Junction. Women fainting on the “dark stretch” between Horley and Croydon. I’ve seen vomit in Balcombe and smelt some of the finest B.O. in Sussex.

'However, the thing I’m going to focus all my baffling attention on is the fact that every train is delayed. You may well have ruddy-faced analysts telling you that: “We’re actually running a service with 79% of trains running on time.” But take it from me. A man at the fried-chicken smelling coal-face. Almost every single train to and from work is delayed.'

In response, Tim O'Toole said today: 'This is definitely one of the most creative complaints that I've seen and Oli’s work is an improvement on my photo!

'But there's a serious point here: 
trains on this section of the route are frequently held up in the area 
around London Bridge and I'm sorry that Oli and others get delayed 
because of this.

'It's 
mostly because we have to share tracks around the station with many 
other routes and operators, and there is plenty of improvement work 
going on in the area for the Thameslink Programme.

'This
 will result in a brand new station and dedicated train tracks and 
platforms for Thameslink services and there will be a fleet of new, 
longer, trains as well from 2016 which we've been developing with the 
Government – our only regret is that we won’t be getting the opportunity
 to deliver these improvements ourselves as they will be introduced 
after our handover to GoVia from September.'
