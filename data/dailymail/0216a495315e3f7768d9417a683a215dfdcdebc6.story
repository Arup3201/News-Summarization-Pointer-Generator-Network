David Cameron sent a personal apology to Alan Titchmarsh after one of his Cabinet ministers called the TV gardener a ‘complete muppet’.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson attacked the presenter for questioning the Government’s response to ash dieback at the height of the disease in 2012.

Mr Titchmarsh revealed the letter of apology from the Prime Minister in an interview. The 64-year-old described Mr Cameron’s gesture as ‘incredibly big-hearted and generous’, adding: ‘He apologised for things that were said out of turn.’

Mr Paterson made the comment after Mr Titchmarsh criticised the official response to ash dieback. He claimed advice to wash boots, dogs and children after visiting woodland would have ‘minimal effect’.

The minister later told the gardener he had not known he was being recorded when he made the comments to an interviewer. The pair have since made up.

Mr Titchmarsh subsequently wrote to Mr Paterson to explain his position on ash dieback and was invited to his home. The gardener told the Daily Telegraph: ‘We discovered – which I think shocked him – that in 95 per cent of matters we were in complete agreement.’

Mr Titchmarsh said he tried not to get into disputes as his philosophy ‘is to try and not upset people, to just bump my way through and try to not get in anybody’s way’.

But he had more criticism for the Government, saying the Conservatives ‘were traditionally a party of the shires and they – how can one put it? – seem to have drifted away from that.’
