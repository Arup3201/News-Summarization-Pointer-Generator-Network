Manchester is known for its murky skies and greying buildings, but something else up there is turning a little off-white, too.... its women's underpants.

The city has been outed as capital with the most greying underwear, with women admitting that 12 pairs of their 18 white knickers have seen brighter days.

Meanwhile, down in London, women are better at keeping their undies sparkling (or better at lying), with girls in the capital saying only three of their average 18 pairs aren't as crisp and white as they once were.

Manchester vs London: The North South divide comes into play in the white-off

The nationwide study of 1,500 women revealed that the average adult female in the UK owns 18 items of white underwear, with many of these beginning to look grey over time, due primarily to being  washed incorrectly or simply being old.

And it appears there's a clear north-south divide when it comes to white underwear having passed its heyday.

In Southampton just 18 per cent of ladies' white undies are greyed out. But up in Glasgow, from a collection of 18 items of white underwear, 59 per cent are not whiter than white.

Birmingham, in the heart of the midlands, is closer to the south in its grey underwear count - with ladies owning a white underwear collection that has just 29 per cent greyed content.

White or grey? Whites go grey if washed at the wrong temperature and with other, non-white, clothing items

Maybe the statistics can be explained by how much the owners of the smalls wash their underwear - Mancunian women are the most fervent when it comes to washing their smalls, clocking up an average of three loads per week.

Londoners, however, are not quite so committed in the laundry room, with ladies living in the capital opting for just a single underwear wash per week.

Susan Fermor, spokesman  for Dr Beckmann who carried out the research, said: 'Women in Manchester have the greyest white underwear in the UK. But it seems it is mainly due to the fact that they are the most evangelistic about washing their smalls.

'Unfortunately, they are almost certainly washing them at the wrong temperature, too often and possibly with other, non-white, clothing items which are affecting the brightness of their whites over time.

'They should maybe consider using a whitening product in their wash from time to time to correct the adverse effects of the washing cycle on their smalls.'
