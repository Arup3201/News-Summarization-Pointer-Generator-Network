A teenager waited an agonising eight months before finding the courage to mention he had found a lump - and died of testicular cancer just two weeks later.

Now the heartbroken of family of Michael Rushby, known as Mikey, has urged young men to check themselves after the death of the much-loved 16-year-old.

His mother Patricia, 52, said today: 'He was my baby. I loved him to pieces. I want other young people to know what we have gone through. I wouldn't want any family to go through what we have.'

Michael Rushby, 16, spent eight months agonising over a lump in his testicle. He died two weeks after being diagnosed with cancer

Mikey, the youngest of six brothers and sisters, was having a drink with older brother John, 22, at the family home on April 17 when he finally spoke up.

'He said he had a problem and showed me one of his testicles,' said John.

'The lump was obvious so I took him straight to A&E. The doctor said just by looking at it there was an 80 per cent chance it was cancer.'

Mikey, of Grangetown, Teesside, went home for the night and went back to Middlesbrough's James Cook University Hospital the next day for tests.

Testicular cancer was diagnosed and it was also found the cancer had spread to his abdomen and chest. He was then transferred to Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary for treatment.

Despite the eight-month delay in diagnosis, Mikey was still given a 75 per cent chance of beating the disease.

Heartbroken: Patricia Rushby with older son John, are now urging other young men to check themselves

He had a week of chemotherapy and was allowed to go home on Friday, April 26 at his own request

He was due back at the hospital on Monday April 29 and had got himself up, had a bath, and was heading down the stairs when he lost his strength and collapsed four steps from the bottom.

He was taken by ambulance to James Cook hospital, where he died later that day, it is believed from an infection.

His mother said: 'I think he knew himself he was dying. He was adamant about coming home and he never complained.

'I want to say to anyone who ever thinks they might have a problem, go to your mam, go to your dad, go to someone. Mikey could have come to his mum - I wouldn't have been embarrassed.'

Mikey is survived by his father Michael Rushby, 61, his sisters Lisa, 30, Jacqueline, 27, Michelle, 26, and Leanne, 21, and his six nieces and nephews.

Despite the eight-month delay in diagnosis, Michael was still given a 75 per cent chance of survival. But 
he died just days later on April 29 at James Cook Hospital, Middlesbrough

They described him as a 'little charmer' who would always play jokes on people and had nicknames for everyone.

Jacqueline said: 'Words can't describe how much he will be missed. The house is so different, so quiet.'

His brother John said: 'He will never be replaced. He wasn't just a brother, he was a mate as well. A best mate.'

An inquest into his death has been opened and adjourned at Teesside Coroner's Court.

Testicular cancer is most common in men aged 15-44 and affects around 2,000 each year in the UK.

The most common symptom is a lump or swelling in part of one testicle, but 20 per cent of patients also experience pain in their testicles or lower abdomen. A feeling of 'heaviness' in the scrotum is another symptom.

People with an undescended testicle have
a greater risk of testicular cancer as do people with a family history 
of the disease and those with HIV or AIDS.

It is five times more common in white men than in black men and is also more common in tall men.

It is, however, one of the most treatable cancers. Ninety-seven per cent of patients survive for more than five years after diagnosis and 96 per cent survive for more than ten years.

Once someone has been free of the disease for five years they are considered to be effectively cured.
