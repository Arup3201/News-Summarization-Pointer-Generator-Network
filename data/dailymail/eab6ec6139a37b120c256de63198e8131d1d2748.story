Cecilie Herlovsen can remember the terrfiying scenes of the 2011 Oslo shooting massacre like it was yesterday but plans to use overcoming the tragedy to inspire others to do the same.

Not only was her right arm blown apart by crazed gunman Anders Breivik on July 22, 2011 but he also took the life of the then 17 year-old’s best friend along with 76 other innocent humans.

‘I wish I'd gone over to her to take my last goodbye, because the second I saw her, I knew she was dead,’ Herlovson told 9 Stories.

The fresh-faced teen was staying on the isolated island of Utoya at a youth camp where every single person was completely oblivious of the horror that was about to unfold when Breivik went on a cold-blooded rampage.

Ms Herlovson, now 19, recalls hearing the first shot when they were in the main building at the camp.

‘At first, no one understood what the shot was, because it was such an absurd noise to hear at a summer camp. We heard several more shots before we saw a person walking towards the building, turn and point a gun at us,’ Ms Herlovsen said.

What followed was an hour and a half of an unimaginable living hell, as Breivik systematically hunted and shot anyone who crossed his path.

'Everyone began running towards the other end of the building to get away from him. I remember getting lost in the crowd and not finding my best friend, Andrine," Herlovson said.

‘We ended up stuck in a hallway, because we couldn't get the door open.'

'I remember the eerie silence right before the loud thud of him kicking in the door. Then the shooting started again.’

The first two bullets that struck the petrified teen were hunting pellets that explode on impact blowing off her right arm. She considers herself lucky that the third was a normal bullet which hit her right cheek.

She eventually escaped the building with her friends and took cover in some ‘small trees’ which she described as ‘a stupid decision' because they were quite visible.

‘I don't know how long we waited there, but suddenly I saw him coming towards us. When he started shooting, the best we felt we could do, was just lie down, and hope to survive,’ she said.

The first two bullets that struck the petrified teen were hunting pellets that explode on impact blowing off her right arm.

‘I remember the pain just swallowing me whole. It was so intense, and the burning feeling was so surreal.

'I remember looking down on my own arm and thinking, "This is not my arm. It has to be fake. This cannot be my arm”.’

'The second bullet hit my shoulder, but I have no memory of it. I didn't pass out, but my brain just didn't register it.'

Ms Herlovson considers herself ‘lucky’ that the third and final bullet was not of the explosive kind as it hit her right cheek.

‘I remember it as just a force pushing my face into the stone, but I never knew what had actually happened until they told me at the hospital.’

'I don't use my time feeling my hate towards him,’Ms Herlovson said. ‘When I finish school, I want to get a job working with troubled teens’

After being separated from her best friend during the carnage, Herlovsen didn’t find her until the gunfire finally stopped.

‘I saw Andrine lying on the ground on the stomach, facing away from me. The second I saw her, I knew she was dead,’ she said.

Emergency crews had begun loading the dead and injured onto boats to make the journey back to the mainland.

‘I wish I had gone over and said my last goodbye,’ she said.

Breivik preceded his rampage at Utotya by detonating a car bomb outside the office block housing Norway's Prime Minister which killed eight and left hundreds injured.

The right-wing extremist cited both attacks as politically motivated.

It has naturally taken Ms Herlovson to return some semblance of normality but told 9 Stories she has now finally found peace.

‘I'm doing really well now. I have friends and family who have supported me through it all,’ she said, adding that she rarely, if ever, thinks of her attacker.

‘I hate him. I really do. But I don't use my time feeling my hate towards him,’ she said. ‘I hate him, yes, but I also really don't care.’

She now plans to use her experience in overcoming tragedy to help others do the same.

‘When I finish school, I want to get a job working with troubled teens.’

Anders Behring Breivik was sentenced to 21 years in jail in 2012.
