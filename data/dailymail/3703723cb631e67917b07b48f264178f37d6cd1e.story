A woman left paralysed from head to toe after a bout of tonsillitis has made a miraculous recovery.

Becki Bolger, 25, spent four months fighting for her life after the throat infection triggered the killer nerve disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome.

The condition attacks the lining of the nerves, leaving patients unable to move, swallow or breathe unassisted.

Miss Bolger, a council worker from Coventry, survived despite her lungs collapsing twice and suffering pneumonia five times.

She has since gone on to stun medics by learning to walk and talk again.

She said: 'Doctors told my family they didn’t think I was going to make it as I had a severe form of the disorder.

'I was so scared about what was happening that they had to heavily sedate me.

'My recovery has been a very slow process. When I took my first steps, I sobbed. It was amazing.'

Miss Bolger was enjoying a weekend away in London with boyfriend Steve Coulson, 34, when she fell ill in October 2010.

'I’d had tonsillitis but I thought I’d feel better when I got to London. We’d only been going out together for six weeks so I didn’t want to cancel.

Over the weekend her legs and feet became sore and numb. 'It was like I had really bad pins and needles.'

By the time the couple returned, she couldn’t walk or speak and was rushed to University Hospital Coventry.

Luckily, Miss Bolger was seen by a doctor who recognised she had Guillain-Barre syndrome, despite it being so rare.

She was immediately rushed to intensive care and put on a ventilator to breathe for her.

'I was paralysed from head to toe - I didn’t know what was happening but I was so scared,' she recalls.

Over the next four months her family kept a vigil at her bedside. And despite only being together a few weeks, Mr Coulson visited her every day.

Her family event ate their Christmas dinner in the hospital so she wouldn’t miss out, even though she has no memory of the day.

They, along with Mr Coulson and the nurses, kept diaries of everything she did - such as the slightest movement - and what was happening in the outside world to help her recover the time she lost. 

'When I woke up, mum told me how seriously ill I was and I just cried. I didn’t know what was going to happen to me.

'But I cried more for the people around me having to watch how poorly I was. It was so hard on them.'

Doctors told Miss Bolger's family to prepare for the worst as she had a severe form of Guillain-Barre syndrome

Nurses and family wrote diaries for Miss Bolger while she was sedated and on a ventilator

In February last year, Miss Bolger slowly started to breathe on her own and doctors removed her ventilator. She was moved from intensive care to a ward and slowly began to get the feeling back in her arms and legs.

With the help of physiotherapy, Miss Bolger had to re-learn how to do everything. 'I couldn’t even sit up by myself and had to learn how to hold a cup, brush my hair, clean my teeth. I’d taken all these things for granted before.

'It was very hard. I didn’t know if I would be in a wheelchair for the rest of my life.'

But months later, she took her first steps with a walking frame and she was eventually strong enough to leave hospital.

She has since returned to work and, better still, is busy planning her wedding after Mr Coulson proposed in February this year.

'Steve has seen me at my worst but he stuck by me and has been my rock. I really wouldn’t be here without his and my family’s support.

'I’m also so thankful to the doctors and nurses for saving my life. I still can’t believe something like tonsillitis caused it.'

Guillain-Barre (pronounced Ghee-lan Bar-ray) syndrome is a rare but serious condition of the nerves that control the body's senses and movements. It affects about 1,500 people in the UK every year and is slightly more common in men than women.

It causes the immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness) to attack these nerves, causing them to become inflamed.

Symptoms include a tingly, numb sensation in the arms and legs which can result in a loss of feeling and movement.

Most people who develop it have suffered from a viral or bacterial infection (such as tonsillitis) a few weeks before.

Around 80 per cent of people make a full recovery within a few weeks or months, and do not have any further problems such as permanent nerve damage.
