Dr Helen Roberts's first reaction on discovering that her twin sons had chickenpox was to consider the logistics.

The scenario will be familiar to lots of working parents: children with chickenpox are meant to stay at home until all the spots have crusted over and they  are no longer contagious, as the disease is dangerous to pregnant women and those with compromised immune systems.

As the disease is often passed from sibling to sibling, this can mean a parent taking several weeks off work.

In fact, Helen's sons, Will and Peter, then aged two-and-a-half, had contracted the virus at the start of a family holiday on the Isle of Wight, which was a relief as it meant neither she nor her husband would need to take time off work to care for them.

But while her otherwise healthy twins coped well for the first two days of their illness, on the third day Will developed a persistent high fever and started to vomit.

'He was just not himself, grizzly and saying he was hot and didn't feel well,' says Helen, a GP from Surrey.

Strongly suspecting Will was seriously ill, she took him to hospital.

'When I arrived they told me they didn't want a child with chickenpox there and I should take him to the GP.

'It's the only time I've ever done it, but I said: “I am a GP, and I am worried about him.” The staff were really off with me, put me in a side room and left me there.'

Nearly four hours later, Will was seen by a consultant, who immediately realised the severity of his condition. The little boy was given anti-viral drugs via a drip, but as he was being prepared for transfer to a larger hospital in Southampton, his condition suddenly deteriorated and he died just as he was about to be put into an ambulance.

'They'd said they thought it would be nicer for him to be asleep for the transfer so they gave him an anaesthetic,'  says Helen.

'I'd told him he was going to have a little sleep and that when he woke up we would be home. He just said “Night, night, Mummy” and for that moment he seemed much brighter.

'It's a comfort to me because he was obviously not frightened. But it was shortly after then that the doctors realised they were losing him. I was in the room and watched as they tried to save him.'

Will died from encephalitis - swelling of the brain - a rare complication of chickenpox that happens when the virus reaches the brain.

It might have been treatable had he been given anti-viral drugs when he'd arrived at hospital.

Helen, her husband John and their two older children's grief and distress was further compounded because the same day Will died, Peter became critically ill with encephalitis, too.

'There can't be many worse situations to be in as a parent,' she says.

Peter survived, but for the next seven years suffered fits as a result of the damage caused by scarring to his brain.

Now 16, he's not had a fit for six years and is a bright and sporty teenager. Helen still has no idea why her twins reacted so badly to the virus, but her experience was far from unique.

'After Will died I wrote a piece for Pulse, the GP magazine, to raise awareness of how serious chickenpox can be and got inundated by people who had their own horror stories,' she says.

'Until then, I thought we had been really, really unlucky, and then I realised it wasn't just us.'

There are vaccines against chickenpox. Indeed, many experts argue in favour of vaccination - something that has been routine for children in the U.S. for 20 years. And no one is a more staunch supporter than Dr Roberts.

While she's keen to stress that for the majority of children chickenpox is a mild illness, she feels people should know that for some youngsters it can be life-threatening, even fatal. However, the chickenpox vaccine is not available on the NHS for otherwise healthy youngsters, and can be done only privately, at up to £250 for each child.

The Government's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation last considered introducing the jab on the NHS in  2010, but ruled that it was not  cost-effective as so few children become dangerously ill. A  2007 study estimated chickenpox caused serious complications - including encephalitis, pneumonia and secondary bacterial infections - in fewer than one in 10,000 children.The researchers from Health Protection Scotland and the universities of London and Bristol found 112 children who had serious complications of chickenpox. Six deaths were reported.

But excluding one baby that died in the womb and four that had existing chronic health problems, such as HIV or cerebral palsy, it seemed only one healthy child died, out of a total population of more than ten  million.

Helen, however, argues that the real figures are likely to be much higher.

'I think there's a huge amount of under-reporting,' she says.

'My little boy's death certificate had "viral illness" written on it, so he wouldn't have hit the statistics even though it was entirely caused by chickenpox.'

In her GP practice, she  typically sees two serious cases of chickenpox a year, slightly more than meningitis.

Last week an inquest into the death of seven-year-old Nicole Murphy from Stourport in Worcestershire heard how the otherwise healthy child may have died from a fit triggered by chickenpox just 24 hours after she broke out in spots. Another argument against widespread vaccination is that it could lead to a rise in the number of elderly people developing the often- debilitating condition shingles, where nerves and the skin around them become infected.

This happens because the varicella-zoster virus, which causes chickenpox, remains in the body after you've had the illness.

While most people won't get chickenpox again, it can be reactivated as shingles - commonly in old age or when your immune system is compromised.

Little and frequent exposure to the 
varicella-zoster virus through being around those with chickenpox keeps 
the body primed to fight it.

But if this is eliminated because of  widespread vaccination, the theory is that shingles will become more common.

A persistently high fever of above 38.5 degrees.

Vomiting , which is a sign the brain may be affected.

Significant coughing, an indication the infection has spread to the lungs.

Often these symptoms come four or five days after catching chickenpox.

This is disputed by Adam Finn, a professor of paediatrics at Bristol University, specialising in invasive infections in children and clinical trials of vaccines. 'In the U.S., because of vaccination 
chickenpox is virtually unheard of now and studies have revealed 
that while shingles has increased a little, it is not nearly as much as 
was predicted.'

For Professor Finn the answer to whether to vaccinate against it is a straightforward 'yes'.

'It's
 a horrible disease,' he says. 'Many of my colleagues - paediatricians -
 bring their own children to my clinic to be vaccinated because they've 
seen how it can be.'

However,
 Dr Richard Halvorsen, a GP and author of The Truth About Vaccines, 
believes chickenpox is simply not serious enough to warrant a 
vaccination programme.

He says the chickenpox jab is more sought after because it's an inconvenience for parents to take time off work.

He does offer the chickenpox jab at his children's immunisation clinic BabyJabs, but admits: 'It would be low in my priorities. It's up to you, but it's generally a mild illness and your child is unlikely to come to any serious harm.'

He believes natural immunity from 
having a disease is always better and longer-lasting than from the 
vaccine and says while protection from the chickenpox jab should last at
 least ten years, it potentially just pushes the illness into an older 
age bracket. And chickenpox can be very nasty for adults.

Professor Finn disagrees: 'There are no advantages to getting it naturally.'

As
 for chickenpox 'parties' - where mothers encourage their children to 
socialise with youngsters with chickenpox so they catch it - Helen 
Roberts is far from convinced.

'I
 try not to frighten mums who come to see me, but you just don't know if
 your child is going to be the one who reacts in the way Will did.'

Helen says she tries not to frighten mums who come to see her, but you just don't know if your child is going to be the one who reacts in the way Will did
