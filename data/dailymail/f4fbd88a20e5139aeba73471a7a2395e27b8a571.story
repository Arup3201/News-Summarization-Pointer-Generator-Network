The daughter of disgraced music producer Phil Spector has revealed the toll of prison life on her father.

Spector, 73, is serving a prison sentence of 19 years to life for the 2003 murder of actress Lana Clarkson.

Nicole Audrey Spector, 30, said each time she sees her 'pop' , he looks 'thinner, wispier.'

The music producer who worked with famous bands including The Beatles, is currently housed in California State Prison, Corcoran.

In 2009 he was found guilty of shooting the 40-year-old actress in the mouth in the foyer of his sprawling California mansion.

Nicole is one of Spector's five children - she was born when the musician was with his then-girlfriend Janis Zavala.

Her twin brother  Philip Jr. died of leukaemia, aged ten.

Spector
was famous for his Wall of Sound production technique, which scored him
a slew of hits including The Beatles' Let It Be.

He also co-wrote 'You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'' for the Righteous Brothers and produced records for the Ramones.

Nicole,
who is now a writer, said in an article for The Times insists her 
father is innocent: 'My father, who I love like a son, didn’t kill 
anyone. Neither of us is supposed to be here.'

She said her visits have become less frequent due to not having a home in California.

'The last time I visited was nine 
months ago, a fact that makes me anxious and ashamed. I feel I should be
there every weekend. But I don’t have a home in California anymore. I 
used to be able to stay in my old room in my father’s house, which he 
still has, but his wife won’t allow it, and I’m not up for the fight 
anymore.'

She is referring to Spector's third Rachelle Short - a model and actress around 40 years his junior.

The couple met at a Hollywood restaurant in 2003, shortly after his arrest in the shooting of actress Lana Clarkson.

Rachelle went to work as Spector's assistant and was running his 
business by the time they married in 2006 in the foyer of his mansion, 
where Clarkson was found dead.

Spector's
initial trial in 2007 for the murder of Lana Clarkson, who died from a 
gun shot wound to the head, ended in a deadlocked jury.

But a second jury in 2009 found him guilty of second degree murder with a sentence of 19 years in prison.

Throughout both hearings Spector's high-priced defence team had claimed that Miss Clarkson killed herself in a fit of despair over her fading film career.

Spector had met the struggling actress, 40, at a Hollywood nightclub where she was working as a hostess at the time, and invited her back to his Alhambra mansion.

But while Spector strongly maintained his innocence outside the Los Angeles courtroom, he chose not to put his side of the story from the witness box.

His chaffeur Adriano de Souza testified he saw Spector clutching a pistol shortly after Miss Clarkson was shot, saying: 'I think I just killed somebody.'

Spector, a man obsessed with guns, liked to dine out on the story that he once pulled a pistol on John Lennon in a recording studio.

But in the end, his violent past caught up with the man who worked with stars like the Beatles, Tina Turner, The Ronettes and the Righteous Brothers in his heyday and was credited with revolutionising pop production in the 1960.

A procession of women gave evidence about Spector's drunken attacks, invariably involving guns.

They painted a disturbing picture of an out-of-control maniac, drunk on his own reputation and convinced that he was too famous to be brought to account. Threatened and terrorised by Spector, his victims - who were either dating him or longtime friends - never called police.

It was only when Clarkson's body was discovered in a pool of blood in the early hours of February 3, 2003 - with Spector standing over her with a gun - that his previous victims began to come forward.

One after another they told the court a variation on essentially the same story; how Spector, a normally charismatic if rather strange man, would fly into a rage after drinking too much and threaten them with guns when they tried to leave.
