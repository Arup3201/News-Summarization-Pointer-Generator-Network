Plans for a beauty brand: Nancy Dell'Olio wore false eyelashes from her new range to a yacht party

At the age of 51, confident Nancy Dell’Olio  could pass for decades younger.

Now she wants to help other women who 'want to be like' her by launching her own beauty brand.

The former partner of Sven Goran Eriksson revealed her plans at a party in Cannes this week.

She said false eyelashes will be the first product from her range to go on sale and she could then venture into hair, make-up and perfume.

She modelled a pair of her own brand Nancy 
false eyelashes for the first time as she attended the Sunseeker 
super-yacht party in Cannes for singer Stacey Jackson's album launch.

A source at the party said: 'Nancy was saying 
that several beauty companies have approached to do beauty products and 
ranges but the eyelashes are the first one that are actually going to go
on sale.

'If it's a success she will think about doing other beauty 
products.'

Nancy announced her first foray into the beauty business as she mingled with guests including actor Sid Owen and Made In Chelsea stars Spencer Matthews and Lucy Watson at the party.

She wore a split black skirt with a leather jacket and polka dot blouse.

However, she did not maximise the opportunity to promote the false eyelashes - that she designed and manufactured herself - when she pulled on her sunglasses on the £20m super yacht - even though it was raining.

Nancy, who is a self-confessed fan of 
Botox and has admitted to having the treatment twice a year, has said 
before she is keen to share her beauty secrets with the many women who 
she believes 'want to be like' her.

She told the Evening Standard: 'I mean just look at me! The majority of women want to be like me.'

In another interview with the newspaper she added: 'Women stop me everywhere! So I do know they have an affection. And I'm proud of this. Society is superficial. That’s why my contribution is important.'

The former lawyer's latest business venture comes after she has finally reached a settled with her football manager ex to move out of the luxury Belgravia apartment they once shared.

Nancy had refused to move out of the £3.75million property following her split from Sven, 64, seven years ago.

It was reported she had wanted £3m to cut her ties with him but has since settled for less so they can now both move from from their rocky relationship.
