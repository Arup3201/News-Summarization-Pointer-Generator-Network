Executed: Humberto Leal Garcia lost his appeal against execution amid claims he was denied his rights under the Vienna Convention

A United Nations official said that the U.S. was in breach of international law when they put Humberto Leal Garcia to death in a prison in Texas last night.

The 38-year-old Mexican citizen was executed by lethal injection for raping and bludgeoning Adria Sauceda, 16, to death with a 40-pound chunk of asphalt.

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said Leal's execution 'raises particular legal concerns', including whether he had access to consular services and a fair trial.

Pillay also cited a 2004 International Court of Justice ruling saying the U.S. must review and reconsider the cases of 51 Mexican nationals sentenced to death, including Leal's.

He claims this never happened.

In his last statement before he died, Leal apologized to the victim's family and asked for their forgiveness, according to MSNBC.

He said: 'I truly am sorry. That is all. Let's get this show on the road.

'One more thing: Viva Mexico, Viva Mexico'

Texas executed Leal despite objections from President Obama's administration that the action would violate international treaty obligations and put U.S. citizens abroad at risk.

The high court's 5-4 decision was a setback for the administration.

While there were few who doubted his 
guilt, Garcia's lawyers said he was not given the chance to contact the 
Mexican consul which was his right under The Vienna Convention.

The White House also fear that his execution could affect U.S. diplomatic interests.

Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, had already rejected appeals to stop the
 execution from former president George W Bush as well as diplomats, 
judges, senior military officers and the United Nations.

Before the Supreme Court ruling came through a spokesman said the governor had no plans to halt the execution and the Texas Attorney General's office has urged the Supreme Court not to intervene.

Leal made the 45-mile trip to the Huntsville Unit of the Texas Department of 
Criminal Justice from death row at the Polunsky Unit, just outside 
Livingston.

Appeal: The Obama administration was keen to stop the execution believing it could be detrimental to international relations and affect the treatment of Americans arrested abroad

Humberto Leal Garcia asked for:

Prison officials described him as calm.

Leal's final meal request included fried chicken, tacos, fried okra and a
 bowl of pico de gallo.

He selected a sister, one of his 
attorneys and three friends to witness his lethal injection.

Also scheduled to witness are two friends of the father of his victim, 16-year-old Adria Sauceda of San Antonio.

Leal was convicted in 1994 of raping the girl before bludgeoning her to death with a '30 to 40-pound' piece of asphalt rock 'roughly twice the size of the victim's skull' in San Antonio Texas.

'There was a gaping hole from the corner of the victim's right eye extending to the centre of her head from which blood was oozing,' court documents read.

'The victim's head was splattered with blood.'

Texas
 authorities failed to tell Leal, who was born in Mexico and has lived 
in the U.S. since the age of two, that under the Vienna convention he 
was entitled to contact the Mexican consulate when he was arrested.

Texas Governor Rick Perry brushed aside appeals from the United Nations and top diplomats to stay Leah's execution

Leal's
 lawyers argued that the lack of consular access played a role in the 
death penalty being applied because the Mexican national incriminated 
himself in statements made during 'non-custodial interviews' with the 
police on the day of the murder.

Had Leal been given access to the 
Mexican consulate it would have been likely to have arranged a lawyer 
who would have advised the accused man to limit his statements to the 
police. As it was, the Mexican authorities were never informed of his 
arrest.

However Texas officials argue
 that Leal Garcia made statements to authorities before he was in 
custody and thus outside the purview of the Vienna Convention.

State
 Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the federal government had 
filed a brief with the U.S. Supreme Court on July 1 supporting Humberto 
Leal Garcia's bid for a stay of execution until the end of this year.

The UN high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay, appealed to Perry to commute Leal's sentence to life imprisonment

She said: 'This is to allow some 
consideration of the fact that Mr. Leal was not afforded a visit by 
Mexican consular officials at an appropriate moment in the trial 
proceeding - so to allow that to be taken into account.'

The
 Obama administration warned that allowing the execution to go forward 
could have serious repercussions on U.S. foreign relations and 
implications for Americans arrested abroad.

In a letter dated June 28, U.S. 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Attorney General Eric Holder 
wrote: 'The United States is best positioned to demand that foreign 
governments respect consular rights with respect to U.S. citizens abroad
 when we comply with these same obligations for foreign nationals in the
 United States.'

A 2004 ruling by the International 
Court of Justice held that the United States must review Leal Garcia's 
conviction and sentence to remedy earlier instances in which the Vienna 
Convention had not been honored in U.S. criminal cases.

The
 top U.N. human rights official last week urged Texas call off Leal 
Garcia's execution, as have dozens of former U.S. law enforcement 
officials and ex-diplomats who argue that it would put Americans at risk
 in prosecutions abroad.

Sandra Babcock, a Northwestern University Law School professor, has been hired by the Mexican government to represent Leal.

She points to the fact that, three years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a similar appeal by a Mexican national convicted in Texas who objected to the lack of consular consultation.

She said: 'We have presented substantial evidence that in this case, the Vienna Convention really mattered.

'The fact is that, if Mr. Leal had received the consular assistance that he was entitled to, he never would have been convicted, let alone sentenced to death.'

The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state's highest criminal court, rejected Leal's request for a stay of execution.

They claimed that Leal 'doesn't have a due process right to remain alive until the proposed legislation becomes law.'

Texas executes more criminals than any other state and that has long caused friction with Mexico, which has no death penalty.

Although the U.S. government has signed the Vienna Convention, Congress has not passed a law to implement it.
