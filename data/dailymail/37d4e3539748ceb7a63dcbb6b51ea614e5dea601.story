Kevin Pietersen has hit out at the captaincies of Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook, claiming Graeme Swann made them look good.

The spinner retired in the middle of England's 5-0 whitewash defeat in Australia and the hosts go into the series with India without a front-line spinner.

And Pietersen believes England have a fight on their hands, even though India have not won a Test on these shores since 2007.

Missing man: Graeme Swann will not be part of England's squad for the India series after retiring

Main man: Swann played a key roll in England winning the Ashes last summer

Writing in his Daily Telegraph column, he said: ‘The other major difference this time around is the loss of Graeme Swann.

‘I wrote in my first column that the biggest issue facing the England team was the absence of Swann. Alastair Cook struggles to captain the side when opposition batters become established because he cannot toss the ball to Swann, who could defend and attack in equal measure.

‘Swann made Andrew Strauss’s captaincy look good and he made Cook’s look good, too, by making crucial breakthroughs when the opposition were threatening to take the game away.

'It was down to Swann’s genius, and not tactical masterstrokes. The Indians respect Swann hugely, they think he is a fantastic bowler and I know they are licking their lips about facing any other English spinner who bowls to them.’

Confirmation: Pietersen went on Twitter to say his column was written before the Strauss C-word controversy
