Lava from the Kilauea volcano on Hawaii's Big Island is inching closer to the small town of Pahoa. As these images show, molten rock is burning away at the asphalt as it fills the driveway of a disused refuse station.

The first Hawaiian house was consumed this week by the months-long, slow-moving lava flow that has been inching its way towards homes in Pahoa, which has around 1,000 residents. 

Lava is also is oozing out near a cemetery and at another spot about 400 yards upslope of a rural road, but Hawaii County Civil Defense said in a statement Thursday that  the three breakouts do not pose an immediate threat to area residents.

The current flow began in June and has been moving northeast form the volcano, but the part the flow closest to the town's main road is still at the spot where it stalled two weeks ago.

Kilauea has been erupting continuously for more than 31 years. Earlier flows traveled south, smothering the Royal Garden and Kalapana subdivisions in the 1980s and 1990s.

Holding a grudge? The Kilauea volcano has been erupting continuously for more than 31 years

Lava flow from the Kilauea volcano that began on June 27 pushes its way through a fence of a now-closed refuse transfer station and moves down the slope onto station grounds in Pahoa, Hawaii. The flames are caused by burning asphalt.

The image shows  a tumulus, or domed hill, formed following an inflation occurring within the core of a pahoehoe flow. Occasionally the pressure within the flow can exceed the strength of the crust, resulting in an outpouring of lava from the core of the tumulus

There are no active toes of lava in the image, but the lava is still hot enough to burn the asphalt beneath, creating visible white smoke
