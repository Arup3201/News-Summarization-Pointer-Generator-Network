Greece's secret service is investigating an unusually large number of wildfires across the country to see if arson has been involved.

More than 20 major blazes are raging out of control in Greece, including one that has ravaged the eastern Aegean island of Chios for four days.

Announcing the decision to bring in the secret service, Public Order Minister Nikos Dendias said in many cases authorities have 'indications, if not proof, that the fires were lit intentionally', including blazes on Chios and the western resort island of Zakynthos.

On Sunday, authorities on the central
Aegean island of Andros arrested two French tourists on suspicion of 
starting a forest fire.

In Chios, firefighters are battling two major fronts in central and southern areas.

Whipped
on by gale-force winds, the blazes have wiped out large tracts of 
forest, olive groves and plantations of mastic trees whose resin 
production is a mainstay of the island's economy.

About
360 firefighters, soldiers and volunteers are being assisted by two 
water-dropping planes and seven helicopters, the fire brigade said.

The
blaze began shortly after 2am on Saturday, and authorities estimate 
that by yesterday it had destroyed at least 29,650acres of vegetation 
amid the island's fortified medieval villages, which have so far escaped
damage.

Chios is famous for its mastic, a 
gum-like resin with a distinctive flavour produced only by trees on 
certain parts of the island. More than half the crop is exported for use
in confectionery, cooking and cosmetics.

Forest
fires are common during Greece's long hot summers, but the country has 
seen hundreds of blazes in recent weeks following a heat wave.

Mr Dendias said: 'We face an incredibly large number of fires.'

He added that 589 wildfires have begun in the past 12 days alone, with 16 of them starting on Tuesday morning last week.

The
fire brigade said it was battling 22 major blazes, with several in the 
southern Peloponnese area where about 60 people died in massive 
wildfires five years ago.

Fleeing: Residents from the village of Lithi find refuge at the beach on Sunday as a wildfire burns on the nearby mountains on the island of Chios in the Greek archipelago

Local media reports that the smoke can be seen from the island of Crete, over 60miles south of Chios.

The
island is the fifth largest in the Greek archipelago and is a popular 
tourist destination with many tourists drawn to its scenery and medieval
villages, which are now at risk.

It is not clear if the 11th century monastery of 'Nea Moni', which is a UNESCO
World Heritage Site, will be saved from the flames but local media 
reports that the fire is likely to have caused substantial damage to the
islands tourism industry.
