Champion cyclist Chris Froome's outspoken fiancée has hit out at Bradley Wiggins for failing to congratulate his Sky teammate on his Tour de France victory.

Michelle Cound previously clashed with Wiggins' wife Cath when she implied that the role played by her husband-to-be in helping to secure Sir Bradley's 2012 win went unacknowledged.

Miss Cound now claims the Wiggins have not contacted Froome, 28, since he became only the second Briton to win the Tour de France last week, and said the couple should have 'been a bit more classy and sent a message of congratulations'.

Clash: Froome's fiancee said it was 'fair to say' Wiggins and his wife Cath should have been in touch following his Tour de France win

Asked if it was significant that her fiance had not been congratulated by Wiggins, Miss Cound, who was born in Wales but raised in South Africa, replied 'Yes... they should have', according to a report in The Sun.

Tweets: Michelle Cound appeared to vent her frustration on Twitter during last year's Tour

Wiggins' Team Sky colleague claimed victory in the Tour de France in Paris on July 21, inheriting the title won by Sir Bradley in 2012.

The rivalry between the two cyclists came to light last year when Froome was forced to stay with Team Sky's leader rather than push on up the mountains alone.

Froome finished as runner-up to Wiggins on that Tour.

Miss Cound's latest swipe at the couple comes after her pointed remarks in the wake of the 2012 event, when she tweeted: 'Teamwork
is also about giving the people around you, that support you, a chance 
to shine in their own right.'

Sir Bradley's wife Cath went on to post: 'See Mick Rogers and Richie Porte for examples of genuine, selfless effort and true professionalism.'

Wiggins was forced out of the Tour this year with a chest infection and knee injury.

He has admitted he couldn't bring himself to watch his fellow Team Sky rider storm to victory in France this year.
