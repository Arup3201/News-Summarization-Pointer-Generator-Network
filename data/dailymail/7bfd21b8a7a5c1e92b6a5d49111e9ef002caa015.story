Douglas Lamond was given someone else's medication at a branch of Boots

A blind man has died after being given the wrong prescription at a Boots pharmacy, The Mail on Sunday has learned.

Douglas Lamond, 86, did not realise he had been handed someone else's medication after collecting the drugs at a branch of the chemist in May.

After complaining of feeling unwell, the grandfather was taken to a hospital  accident and emergency department where he later died.

Police have since launched an investigation into Mr Lamond's death after being called in by hospital staff.

Boots,
which has sent a message of  condolence to his family, has refused to 
reveal which branch mixed up the prescriptions or which drugs were 
involved.

Extra safeguards have been put in place at the pharmacist's branches to ensure the mistake is not repeated.

It is believed Mr Lamond began to  feel ill on a weekend in May and was taken to A&E at Ipswich Hospital.

However, his condition worsened and he died on Saturday, May 12.

Following an inconclusive post-mortem examination, an inquest was opened  and adjourned after the coroner ordered toxicology tests.

Police are treating the case as an  unexplained death, and cannot determine whether the wrong drugs were a factor.

Mr Lamond's daughter, Dianne Moore,  a nurse, and her IT consultant husband  Thomas, both 58, who live about 18 miles away in Hintlesham, Ipswich, are said to be very distressed over his death.

The couple, who have two children, Ben, 28, and 26-year-old Alissa, declined to  comment last week.

A statement from Suffolk Police said:  'We were contacted by Ipswich Hospital  at around 6.15pm on Saturday, May 12 with a report that an 86-year-old man from the Felixstowe area had been admitted to  accident and emergency feeling unwell and had subsequently died.

'His next of kin had been informed. The gentleman's death, at this stage, is being treated as unexplained. A post-mortem examination took place on Monday, May 14. The cause of death was unascertained and further toxicology tests are ongoing.

Pharmacist Boots has refused to reveal from which branch the mix up with the prescription happened

'As well as awaiting the toxicology  results, officers are carrying out inquiries to try to establish the circumstances  surrounding the man's death. The matter has been referred to the coroner.

'Initial inquiries would suggest Mr Lamond had been given an incorrect prescription from his pharmacy. However, it has not been established whether the medication Mr Lamond took led to his death.

'This will not be established until the pathologist has received the full toxicology report. Corrective procedures have been introduced at the pharmacy concerned to ensure the correct prescriptions are given to the correct person.'

A statement from Boots UK said: 'Our thoughts are with Douglas Lamond's  family. We are not in a position to comment as the police investigation is ongoing.'

Mr Lamond was born in Scotland but lived for most of his life in Felixstowe,  Suffolk, where he worked as an import clerk at Britain's biggest container port.

His first wife Jean died in 1982, and he remarried five years later. Second wife Cynthia died after a long illness in 2009.

A
neighbour said of Mr Lamond – who was also known as 'Dougie': 'He was 
always cheerful, even though he could see very little and always wore 
dark glasses.

'Even at his 
advanced age his death was a  shock, and the long gap between his death 
and the cremation did make me think  something wasn't right.'

Pharmacist Boots has refused to reveal from which branch the mix up with the prescription happened

A death announcement in a local  newspaper from his family described Mr Lamond as 'an endearing man who will be missed by all who knew him'.

He is believed to have been a member of the Felixstowe Ferry Golf Club, where refreshments were served after his funeral and cremation on July 27.

A spokesman for Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust declined to comment.

Steve Winyard, of the Royal National Institute of Blind People, said: 'While  we cannot comment on the particular  circumstances of this case, RNIB's Losing Patients campaign has been calling on  the NHS and other healthcare providers to end the practice of giving blind and  partially sighted people their health  information in ordinary print.

'Pharmacy systems should be improved to provide prescription labelling and dosage instructions automatically in large print or Braille. Everyone has the right to manage their own health affairs, whether they have a sight problem or not.'
