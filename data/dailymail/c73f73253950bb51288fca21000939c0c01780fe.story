A family holiday to celebrate a honeymoon and a 40th birthday was ruined after a father-of-three was hospitalised with severe gastric illness.

The Swannell family, from West Yorkshire, had booked a week's stay at the First Choice Holiday Village resort in Sarigerme, Turkey, when Mark Swannell, 46, fell seriously ill a few days into the break with diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea and lethargy.

Mr Swannell, a bus driver from Dewsbury, said: 'I was in a really bad way and Nicola had no option but to get the hotel doctor to come to our room as I felt like I was going to collapse.

'I was taken by wheelchair to the surgery, laid out on a stretcher and taken by ambulance to hospital – I couldn't believe this was happening on our special family holiday.

'I was kept in hospital for the rest of the holiday. The break was totally ruined and none of the reps at the resort asked Nicola how I was doing or took any interest in my welfare.

'It has had an impact on more than the holiday though, as I was unable to return to work for one week due to my ongoing illness. I'm just so frustrated and want to know how I fell ill – this was meant to be a dream break but has become nothing but a nightmare.' 

The family claims they were served undercooked chicken and saw cats in the restaurant

Back in 2009, an outbreak of gastric illness at the same resort led to £1.7m paid out in compensation, with 595 people affected by illness. 

Mr Swannell said that some of the food he was served at the hotel had been undercooked. On one occasion, he claims that he cut in to some chicken and noticed blood in the middle. Some food was also said not have to have been served at the correct temperature.

The family's trip to Turkey soon turned into a nightmare blighted by illness

The family also claim that food was left uncovered for prolonged periods of time and appeared as though it had been served more than once. 

They said that cutlery, crockery and table linen used in the restaurant was not up to standard, while they saw cats in the public areas of the hotel and in the restaurant.

Mr Swannell had travelled to the Turkish resort on October 23 with his wife Nicola and their children Lewis, 13, Kyle, 13 and Keira, seven.

'The whole point of the holiday was that it was a great chance for us to get away together as a family to celebrate Nicola's 40th birthday, while we were also treating it as our belated honeymoon after we tied the knot in May,' added Mr Swannell. 

'We were all so excited to be having a break and were absolutely devastated with the way everything turned out.'

Experts from Irwin Mitchell's specialist International Personal Injury team have been instructed to help the Swannell family find answers as to how their trip was ruined by illness,

Jennifer Downing, a legal expert at Irwin Mitchell who is representing the family, said: 'It is very worrying to learn of Mark's illness.

'We have now heard first-hand accounts regarding what the Swannell family faced and have started investigations to identify the cause of Mark's illness in order to get him and the rest of his family the answers that they deserve.

'Mark's illness was severe. He was hospitalised for several days and the illness continued after his return home. Severe gastric illness can be very serious and can cause long lasting health problems for those unfortunate enough to suffer from it. 

'It is important that we find out exactly what caused Mark's illness in this case, not least so that lessons may be learned to reduce the risk of others suffering in the future like Mark and his family have.

'We would like to hear from anyone who travelled to the Holiday Village resort in Sarigerme in 2014, who could give us a first-hand account of conditions at the resort.'

Expert illness lawyers have launched their own investigations into the problems and have revealed their hopes that tour operator TUI UK will work with them to determine the cause of the illness and whether it was contracted at the hotel or elsewhere.

The law firm has previously helped holidaymakers secure justice regarding illness issues at the Holiday Village resort in Sarigerme in 2009; helping 595 people gain settlements of up to £25,000 each in relation to illness and related issues.

A number of guests required hospital treatment in resort due to the severity of their symptoms and some were still troubled by the effects of the illness on returning home to the UK. A number of young children also required hospital treatment on their return to the UK.

Over 400 holidaymakers within the group action suffered gastric illness with over 100 men, women and children suffering from infections including Salmonella, Cryptosporidium, Campylobacter and E-Coli. 

Over 150 holidaymakers did not suffer illness themselves, but had their holidays affected by the illness of members of their family, friends or other guests staying at the hotel. 

A spokesperson for TUI, who manage the First Choice and Thomson brands, told MailOnline Travel: 'We are sorry to hear of the Swannell’s experience at the Holiday Village Turkey in October.

'First Choice closely audits all resorts to which we operate to ensure that health, hygiene and comfort levels are maintained in line with industry standards.

'As this case is now subject to legal proceedings it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.'
