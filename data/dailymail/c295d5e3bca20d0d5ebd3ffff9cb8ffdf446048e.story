No matter how hard the likes of Apple, HTC and Samsung try to boost the quality of their handsets’ sound, they are still lacking. 

The CandyShell Amped case offers a solution by promising to double the volume on the iPhone 5 and 5S without the use of cables, batteries or speakers.

Instead, the case’s interior is carved with a horn-shaped waveguide that directs sound from the speakers on bottom up to a grill on the side.

The CandyShell Amped (pictured) is fitted with a horn-shaped waveguide that redirects music from the speakers at the bottom of the iPhone 5 and 5S up to the side. It also has 'military-grade' protection, and adds 0.28-inch (7mm) depth to the phone

A 17-year-old student recently created
 a similar case that not only mounts an iPhone securely to the 
handlebars of any bike, it doubles up a speaker.

The
 Allo case lets cyclists listen to music, make calls and use navigation 
apps completely hands-free, and without obstructing their hearing with 
earbuds.

Allo is powered by 
two AAA batteries and has an output of up to 90 decibels - the same 
sound as a train horn, for example, and louder than city traffic.

This means navigational instructions and voice calls will be audible above road noises.

This horn-shape does make the Amped thicker than standard cases, but Speck claims it only adds 0.28-inch (7mm) depth.

The case, from California-based Speck, may not be able to improve the quality of the music, but by doubling the output without increasing the volume on the device, it means the sound is less tinny.

The case also doesn’t use any extra battery life.

In addition to amplifying sounds, the CandyShell Amped includes a dual layer shell with a rubberised interior.

This is designed to absorb impacts if the phone is dropped, and a raised bezel protects the screen.

According
 to Speck, the sound power has been tested to acoustic sound quality 
standards, while the shell meets military protection standards.

However,
 all these features come at a price and the Amped costs £44.95 in the UK 
and $44.95 in the U.S, plus a £4.95/$4.95 delivery charge.

Alternatively, the case is available from John Lewis in black, blue and pink.
