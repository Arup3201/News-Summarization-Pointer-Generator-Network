David Beckham is to play a last-minute part in the Olympics opening ceremony - a gesture aimed at thanking the footballer for helping to get the Games to London.

A 'starring role' is thought to have been created especially for the 37-year-old after he was left out of the GB football squad.

Beckham, who had considered boycotting the event, is now said to be in talks with organisers over his precise involvement with Friday's ceremony, which is expected to be watched by a global audience of 4billion.

Carrying the torch: David Beckham is said to be 'delighted and excited' about the prospect of playing a key role in the opening ceremony

The former England captain is said to be 'excited and delighted' about the invitation to join the ceremony - particularly as London is his home city, The People reported.

An Olympics source told the newspaper: 'David will have a starring role in the Games and he is excited about the prospect. It's going to be a big, big surprise.'

The role is said to be in recognition for the footballer's work at the International Olympic Committee vote in 2005, helping London win its bid to host the Games.

He was seen lobbying alongside former Prime Minister Tony Blair and Lord Sebastian Coe and was considered to have played a pivotal role during the final days of the campaign trail.

However, he was said to have been so 
disappointed and angry when he was left out of the Team GB football 
squad by manager Stuart Pearce that he threatened to boycott the Games altogether.

The move was said to have also 
shocked Lord Coe - who is in charge of the 2012 organising committee - 
and he is thought to have begun secretly making plans to involve Beckham
in the proceedings.

It is unclear precisely what role the footballer will play, but speculation that he could light the Olympic torch has been ruled out because the footballer is not an Olympian - a requirement under the rules of the International Olympic Committee.

Instead, organisers are said to have added a new section to the ceremony in Stratford to accommodate him.

A source told The People: 'It's all being kept secretive because both the   Olympics committee and David Beckham's camp want it to remain a huge surprise.

'It will be a fitting role for David who, let's not forget, was a big factor in the UK winning the Olympic bid in the first place.'

Details of his role will be ironed out and finalised tomorrow, sources added.

He will not be the only person in his family to play a part in the Games.

David's wife Victoria is to take part in the closing ceremony of the Games when she performs with the Spice Girls.
