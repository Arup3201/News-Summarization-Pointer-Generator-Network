A New Zealand family uncovered a nasty surprise when they cracked open a can of fruit salad, finding a dead gecko hidden among the chunks of produce.

Sharyn Malcolm, from Waihi - south-east of Auckland, took to social media to showcase the grisly find in her can of Wattie's Pick of the Crop fruit salad.

Wattie's are now investigating Mrs Malcolm's claims as well as an incident where a Northland woman found black mould inside of hers, The New Zealand Herald reported.

Mrs Malcolm told the newspaper the gecko had been floating at the bottom of the can and the tail had broken off.

The mother-of-four said the tail had either been eaten by one of her sons or he had disposed of it.

On Friday, she took to Facebook after speaking with a Wattie's customer representative who had given her a lacklustre response.Â 

Mrs Malcolm claimed the Wattie's employee had advised her to keep the incident to herself.

'Mmmmm watties pick of the crop fruit salad topical (sic) in fruit juice... wait a minutes is that a baby lizard or alligator since this was canned in Thailand?' she wrote.

A gecko expert identified the critter to The New Zealand Herald as a type of gecko that was believed to be from Thailand.

Mrs Malcolm's story sparked another woman to come forward with her story.

Diane Moore, from Northland - located at the tip of New Zealand, said she found black mould growing in six cans of her fruit salad also from the brand Wattie's.

When she contacted Wattie's Ms Moore claimed the company put the onus on her, saying transport from the supermarket to her home must have caused the issue.

But Ms Moore said the cans went straight from the supermarket to her home and were kept in suitable conditions before consumption.

She added Wattie's sent her an $8 coupon to rectify the situation but barely covered the price of spoiled food.

A spokeswoman for the food producer said complaints made to Wattie's were taken seriously and they were 'very disappointed' to hear about the experiences of Ms Malcolm and Ms Moore.

'Wattie's people are very passionate about their products and seek to ensure nothing but happy and satisfied consumers,' the spokeswoman told the New Zealand newspaper.

'From reports we're reading these consumers are not and we need to investigate these matters.'

Daily Mail Australia have contacted Wattie's for comment.
