A Southern California high school basketball coach has been suspended and faces accusations of mercilessly running up the score after his team won a game 161-2, one of the most lopsided scores in state history.

Arroyo Valley High girls' coach Michael Anderson was suspended for two games after the victory last week against Bloomington High.

Anderson said that he wasn't trying to run up the score or embarrass the opposition. His team had won four previous games by at least 70 points, and Bloomington had already lost a game by 91.

Rout: Arroyo Valley High girls' coach Michael Anderson was suspended for two games after the victory last week against Bloomington High. The team posted this picture of the scoreboard after then game 

'The game just got away from me,' Anderson told the San Bernardino Sun  Friday. 'I didn't play any starters in the second half. I didn't expect them to be that bad. I'm not trying to embarrass anybody.'

He says if he had it to do again, he'd have played only reserves after the first quarter, or 'I wouldn't play the game at all.'

But Bloomington coach Dale Chung says Arroyo Valley used a full-court press for the entire first half to lead 104-1 at halftime.

'People shouldn't feel sorry for my team,' Chung said. 'They should feel sorry for his team, which isn't learning the game the right way.'

Anderson has served one game of the suspension, a game his team won 80-19. He'll return after sitting out one more.

'He's a great X's and O's coach,' Chung said. 'Ethically? Not so much. He knows what he did was wrong.'

In the first game without their banned coach, they beat Indian Springs 80-19.
