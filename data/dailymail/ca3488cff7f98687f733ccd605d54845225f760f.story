Sparks flew during a rare late-night hearing before the House Veterans Affairs Committee, as visibly upset Republicans raked VA officials over the coals while the ink was still wet on a scathing inspector general report condemning the agency's deadly failures.

The report found that in Phoenix, Arizona alone, 1,700 U.S. military veterans were denied medical care and others waited an average of 115 days to be seen by a doctor – and that officials covered up the lapses by manipulating wait-lists and other official records.

Tennessee Republican Rep. Phil Roe, a physician and veteran of the Army Medical Corps, summed up the mood on Capitol Hill when he addressed Dr. Thomas Lynch, the VA's assistant deputy undersecretary for health.

Noting that the three officials at the witness table are well-paid but presided over a system that ignored the needs of cash-strapped veterans who are locked into the VA health system, he leveled a sledgehammer at Lynch

'What I don't understand is, as a veteran – as a doctor, as a practitioner – I don't understand how you can stand at a mirror and look at yourself in the mirror, and shave in the morning, and not throw up,' he said, 'knowing that you've got people out there ... how in the world?'

Stare-down: Committee chairman Jeff Miller (R) was merciless, grilling VA brass including Dr. Thomas Lynch (L) as House members heard about mismanagement and misconduct at VA hospitals that let to dozens of deaths

Tempers flare: A disgusted Rep. Phil Roe asked the VA's Dr. Thomas Lynch how he could look in the mirror in the morning 'and not throw up'

'I see some of these people out there. 
They live in my communities, and they can't get in, and they're 
desperate to get in,' howled an incredulous Roe. 'And someone who's making $180,000 a year gets a 
bonus for not taking care of the veterans? I don't get that.'

Rep. Jeff 
Miller, a Florida Republican who chairs the panel, wasted no time in 
going after VA Assistant Secretary for Congressional and Legislative 
Affairs Joan Mooney.

'Until VA understands that we’re deadly serious, you can expect us to be over your shoulder every single day,' he told her.

And then 'deadly serious' became, literally, deadly.

'Why have you not told this committee yet who was disciplined in Augusta, Georgia and Columbia, South Carolina, where nine veterans died because they were on a waiting list for colonoscopies?' Miller asked.

Mooney deflected the question, saying that her office had 'responded to more than 100,000 requests for information,'  but Miller was unimpressed.

'Ma’am! Ma’am! Ma’am! Ma’am!' he exclaimed. 'Veterans died! Get us the answers, please!'

'I understand that, Mr. Chairman,' Mooney replied, and I will look —'

'That’s what you said three months ago!' Miller boomed. 'This has been going on since January. Since January.'

'In case you don’t know it, we put on our website every week what we ask for,' he said, 'and nothing changes from week to week.'

U.S. military veterans were on hand to hear testimony about unauthorized wait-lists in the Phoenix VA Health Care System -- a 'systemic' mismanagement problem that has brought calls for VA Secretary Eric Shinseki to resign

No more Mr. nice guy: Rep. Miller sparred with witnesses about everything from missing paperwork to their habit of looking to prepared notes for canned answers. A VA inspector general's report released Wednesday showed that at least 1,700 veterans in Phoenix, Arizona, were not registered on the proper waiting list to see doctors -- while the hospital falsely reported minimal waiting times to hide delays

Miller aired a laundry list of complaints about the VA's response to congressional demands, including the agency's refusal to brief members of Congress.

'We did ask the [VA] Office of General Counsel to come brief members last week, and the general counsel declined,' the Floridian said. 'He said he declined because he didn’t want to brief the members – he wanted to brief the staff.'

'It takes repeated requests and threats of compulsion to get VA to bring their people here,' a disgusted Miller concluded.

Mooney got he worst of it.

As she referred to prepared notes in order to answer questions, an outraged Miller lost patience. 'Can you say anything without reading your prepared notes?' he demanded?

The VA has reportedly provided the committee with 5,500 pages of documents, but lawmakers are convinced there's much more to be found.

'Let me be clear: I am not happy,' said Maine Rep. Michael Michaud, the committee's ranking Democrat.

'We'll get to the bottom of this, uncover the truth, and ensure a solution is implemented to make sure something like this never happens again.'

Department of Veterans Affairs Assistant Secretary for Congressional and Legislative Affairs Joan Mooney (R) got the worst of Wednesday night's hearing, with House members slamming her for withholding documents Congress has subpoenaed

Flop sweat: Lynch was visibly shaken as he answered questions about the VA's crumbling accountability and the deaths of 40 veterans in Phoenix alone

Roe was more pointed.

'If you don't give us the information,' he said, 'I'm thinking, "There's something they're trying to hide."  Why wouldn't you just turn over the documents, and – they are what they are. Just tell the truth.'

'Is there a reason? ... In my mind, I'm thinking right now that you're hiding something from me. And I have no reason to believe you're not,' he said.

The three VA witnesses were not permitted to offer an opening statement. A Veterans Affairs Committee staff member told MailOnline that there was some internal debate about that decision.

'I guess if they had something to tell us, they should have told us years ago. That was the thinking.'

Questions arose about how and why documents related to the Phoenix cover-up were destroyed – especially off-the-books waiting lists that showed a realistic picture of how long veterans waited for their doctor visits.

On Wednesday at least 58 members of Congress, including 20 Democrats, demanded VA Secretary Eric Shinseki's resignation, with Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain leading the charge and calling on President Barack Obama to fire him if he didn't step down.

Colorado Republican Rep. Mike Coffman added to the bloodletting in the evening, demanding the termination of all three witnesses: Lynch, Mooney, and Michael Huff, a VA congressional relations officer.

'You are not being forthright in your testimony,' Coffman boomed. 'You are here to serve yourselves and not the men and women who have made extraordinary sacrifices to serve this country.'
