Not only had Aussie sensation Nick Kyrgios set his sights on going far at Wimbledon this year, another of the 19-year-old’s key goals was to pass the 25,000-follower mark on Twitter.

Kyrgios had 21,000 by the time he walked on court to face world No 1 Rafael Nadal on Tuesday.

Twenty-four hours and one major upset later, he had 65,000  fans on the popular social network.

The players are well-treated at the All England Club — and rightly so — with free food one of the perks of playing at the Championships.

Pasta with cream and tomato sauce is  the dish most often ordered in the players’ restaurant, closely  followed by chicken and basmati rice.

Players also receive a pair of tickets to a London theatre of their choice during the fortnight, the most popular show being The Lion King at the Lyceum Theatre.

As if it were needed, three-time champion John Newcombe served a reminder of the long period of misery for British tennis when the topic was raised during a joint press conference with fellow Australian greats Rod Laver, Neale Fraser and Ken Rosewall.

Newcombe said: ‘It’s a question that’s been asked ever since I’ve been coming over at the beginning of the Sixties. You haven’t come up with a real answer yet.’

As younger brother Andy struggled, Jamie Murray was on Court 18 to complete the victory in his mixed doubles opener with Aussie Casey  Dellacqua.

Having stopped on Tuesday night at one set all, the pair returned to beat Jesse Huta Galung and Andreja Klepac 7-6, 6-7, 6-4.

Mother Judy again chose to watch Jamie before taking her seat on Centre Court around 30 minutes into Andy’s match.

Coach Melanie Molitor faced split loyalties on Court No 2 as she watched her 17-year-old charge Belinda Bencic take on daughter Martina Hingis in a thrilling third-round mixed doubles clash.

Experience won in the end as Hingis and Bruno Soares edged past Bencic and Martin Klizan 6-3, 5-7, 9-7. Switzerland’s Bencic is one of the most exciting prospects on the women’s tour, having already reached No 71 in the world rankings.

Maia Lumsden and Gabriella Taylor joined Katie Boulter in the third round of the girls’ singles with impressive straight-set victories.

Lumsden, the 16-year-old from Glasgow, beat Dalma Galfi 7-5, 6-3, and takes on American Michaela  Gordon, who knocked out Lumsden’s fellow Scot Isabelle Wallace.

Southampton’s Gabriella Taylor beat Tami Grende 6-4, 6-4. Boulter faces Tornado Alicia Black — whose younger sister is called Hurricane.

No American made it through to the last 16 of either the men’s or women’s singles here this year for the first time since 1911, but there is at least hope in  their junior ranks, with seven Americans reaching that stage in the boys’ singles.

Francis Tiafoe, one of the USA’s hottest prospects, takes on compatriot Noah Rubin — no relation to former World No 6 Chanda. The one remaining Briton in the draw, Joshua Sapwell, faces Peru’s Pedro Iamachkine.
