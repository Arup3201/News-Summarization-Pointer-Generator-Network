Manny Pacquiao may be an extremely busy man as he trains for the fight of his life, but he still managed to find the time to resurrect his music career ahead of his May showdown with Floyd Mayweather Jr.

The Pacman is making a music video for his entrance, and he'll be using a song that he's recorded himself in the Phillippines as he continues his preparations.

'It's the song he just recorded in the Philippines,' said Ryan Moore, the director who is making the video.

'We've been shooting just training camp, behind the scenes stuff leading up to the Mayweather fight.'

Pacquiao recorded the tune recently before heading to the US to prepare.  He is currently training at The Wild Card Boxing Club in Hollywood, run by his esteemed trainer Freddie Roach. And the gym is being patrolled by seven armed guards.

'Lalaban ako para sa mga Pilipino. That is the title of this fight,' Pacquiao said.

The $300million (£200m) mega-fight is one of the most anticipated in history, and boxing legend Mike Tyson is the latest star of the sport to give his verdict on the outcome. 

Mayweather is the bookmakers' favourite to win the Las Vegas showdown, but Tyson believes the undefeated American will have to be at his best if he is to extend his unbeaten run.

He said: 'When you think about the two fighters, the only people who gave Manny Pacquiao the most difficult time of his career are people who throw 100 punches a round - Timothy Bradley Jnr and Juan Manuel Marquez.

'Floyd doesn't throw anywhere near 100 punches a round. He is more of a scientific fighter, he really plots a lot, he poses whereas Pacquiao is feinting and moving around. That's just my opinion, Pacquiao has perpetual motion he's all over the god damn place.

'Floyd has to fight in the first couple of rounds, he's going to lose the rounds if he's laid back. He has to come out punching, keep the jab and spin with him.'
