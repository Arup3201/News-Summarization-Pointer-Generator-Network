Steakhouses around the world are well-known for touting their authenticity.

But this Russian restaurant went the extra mile to show off their chargrilling process by setting an entire billboard on fire.

These dramatic images show the moment the stunt promoting the food at Double Grill and Bar, in the city of Yekaterinburg, got underway.

Hot topic: The billboard, advertising char-grilled steaks, was set on fire at night to create authentic burn marks

Passers-by had spent the previous day, in November, bemused by a large photograph of a raw steak, accompanied by no branding or advertising information.

But one night, a pair of men dressed in chef outfits and armed with a flamethrower set the billboard alight along eight lines, mimicking the effects of a flame-grilling.

Before: The billboard began its life as an otherwise unmarked photograph of a slab of beef

Bringing the fire: Two men dressed as chefs used a flamethrower to set the board alight

Though the board was only alight for a matter of seconds before the fire was extinguished, the aftermath left realistic-looking char marks along the meat - giving the illusion that it had been grilled.

Although the trails of smoke emanating from the billboard soon faded, the 'cooked' piece of meat was visible to pedestrians and drivers the next day.

The transformed ad also had the details of the Double Grill and Bar restaurant revealed so intrigued viewers could try out the steaks for themselves.

Extinguisher: After the flames had burned for a short while, the men put out the billboard using fire extinguishers

Well done: After the flames had disappeared, authentic-looking whisps of smoke still drifted from the billboard

Taking the credit: After the stunt, a panel was revealed showing the details of the restaurant
