If you've ever wondered what it's like to stand on the surface of an alien world, drink in these breathtaking pictures of the surface of Mars.

These incredible panoramas have been stitched together by amateur enthusiasts from images sent back from the Red Planet by Nasa's Curiosity rover.

The interplanetary probe is currently investigating the Gale Crater, which sits just south of the Martian equator. The mist-obscured mountains in the background are likely to be its outer rim.

The surface of an alien world: This breathtaking panoramic image was stitched together by Stuart Atkinson from photos received by Nasa yesterday

The first image was put together by Stuart Atkinson from photos received by Nasa just yesterday. It is a mosaic assembled from four separate colour images.

Mr Atkinson, an astronomy writer and outreach teacher who describes himself as a 'frustrated Martian', said: 'Finally a spaceprobe takes a pic that shows Mars as it has burned in my mind all these years.'

The second image was compiled by Emily
 Lakdawalla, a blogger for The Planetary Society, from three separate 
images taken by Curiosity nearly two weeks ago.

'There is no sky visible in this view,' she notes. 'Occupying the distance is Gale's crater rim.' Click here to see Ms Lakdawalla's image in full.

Yesterday it emerged that scientists testing the lasers on Nasa rover Curiosity have discovered rocks with startling similarities to a matter found on Earth.

Researchers expected the substance to contain the same minerals as rocks found elsewhere on the Red Planet, but instead learned it was chemically more akin to an unusual type found on Earth.

The make-up of the rock is similar to one found on oceanic islands like Hawaii and St. Helena, as well as in continental rift zones like the Rio Grande, which extends from Colorado to Chihuahua, Mexico.

Referring to rock formed from molten material, Curiosity scientist Ralf Gellert, from the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, said: 'It was a bit of a surprise, what we found with this rock.

'It's igneous. But it seems to be a new kind of rock type that we encountered on Mars.'

Curiosity arrived on Mars two months ago to learn if the most Earth-like planet in the solar system was suitable for microbial life.

Nasa named the rock after the late 
engineer Jacob Matijevic, who was the surface operations systems chief 
engineer for Mars Science Laboratory and the project's Curiosity rover.

He passed away on August 20, at age
 64 and was a leading engineer for all of the previous NASA Mars rovers:
 Sojourner, Spirit and Opportunity

Last month, Curiosity's laser was used
 to zap the football-sized rock and the rover analysed the pulverised 
material, as well as tiny pits left behind, to determine its chemical 
composition.

Scientists 
found the rock lacks magnesium and iron - elements found in igneous rock
 examined by previous Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity.

The rock, named after a Jet Propulsion
 Laboratory rover engineer, Jake Matijevic, who died shortly after 
Curiosity's landing, was also rich in feldspar-like minerals, which 
provided clues about the rock's history.

Geologist
 Edward Stolper, from the California Institute of Technology in 
Pasadena, compared the make-up of the rock to how hard apple cider was 
partially frozen in big barrels during the winter in colonial times.

He
 said: 'The way in which this type of rock forms ... is like how 
applejack liquor was made. You'd crystallise out ice and you'd make more
 and more and more concentrated apple-flavored liquor.'

Magma
 inside a planet can undergo a similar process, he added, saying it 
takes very particular conditions on Earth to produce this type of magma.

Stolper
 said: 'You melt the interior and it comes to the surface and, just like
 the applejack, when you cool it, it crystallizes.'

Meanwhile,
 the rover has moved on to testing and cleaning of its soil scoop. 
Eventually, scientists want to funnel soil samples to Curiosity's 
onboard laboratory for more extensive chemical analysis.

The
 rover is part way to its first science target, an area known as 
Glenelg, which has three different types of rock intersecting.

The
 car-sized Curiosity rover landed inside a giant impact basin called 
Gale Crater, located near the Martian equator, for a two-year, 
$2.5billion astrobiology mission, NASA's first since the Seventies-era 
Viking probes.
