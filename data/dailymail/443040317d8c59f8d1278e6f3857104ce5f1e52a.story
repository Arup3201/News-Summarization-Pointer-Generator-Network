Plans for traditional Easter egg hunts and family walks will have to be put on hold tomorrow as the UK prepares itself for yet another chilly day.

The elusive spring weather will once again be eclipsed by low temperatures, although forecasters predict that the sun will make an appearance.

After what is thought to be the coldest March in decades, the Bank Holiday weekend will also be accompanied by temperatures up to four degrees lower than the seasonal average.

Forecasters predict that 
temperatures across temperatures will fall to between -2C and -5C 
overnight, resulting in a cool start to the day.

And despite the promise of widespread
Easter Sunday sunshine, temperatures will only climb to between 4C - 
7C, significantly below the 10C - 11C normally expected at this time of 
year.

Meanwhile, spectators
hoping to watch the Easter Sunday Boat Race between Oxford and 
Cambridge might be wise to bring their wellies after the Thames burst 
its banks.

The towpath along the Putney embankment, which is 
usually a popular vantage point for those hoping to watch the race, was yesterday flooded with water.

Streets
along the riverside were affected by high tides and members of the 
public were left stranded after the river overflowed between Barnes and 
Putney Pier.

Pub gardens were under water and cars parked along the banks were submerged by the higher water levels  along the stretch of river in south west London.

Spring tides and melting snow have caused flooding of the Thames between Barnes and Putney Pier

The Environment Agency has released an 
amber flood alert warning that floods are possible
between Putney Embankment and Teddington Lock.

Flooding is also possible in the south east of the city near Trowlock Island, according to an Environment Agency amber warning.

The high water levels are caused by 
spring tides, which are especially strong tides occurring when the moon 
is full or new and aligned with the Earth and the sun.

Spring tides are not affected by the season of Spring but by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun combined.

No floods caused by rain are expected
over Easter, with the Met Office predicting the weather to be mostly 
dry.

Water levels were much higher than usual in Putney and the path along the riverside became impassable on foot

Temperatures dropped to -11C in the 
Scottish highlands last night and the weather will continue to be colder
than normal for spring.

Forecaster Greg Dewhurst said: 'There has been sleet and snow showers in eastern areas like Middlesbrough and down towards the south today but the snow has been scattered and light.

'These showers have been coming in from the east and may just about reach the east of Wales.

'For Easter Sunday it's looking dry across most of the UK with long sunny spells. Temperatures over the bank holiday could drop to -2C and could fall further to -10C in the north of Scotland overnight.

'Tomorrow we could see wintry showers in the afternoon in areas such as Bournemouth, Southampton and Brighton but any snow will be more like sleet, and shouldn't stick or cause any travel problems.

'For the University Boat Race there will be a dry cold start to the day, with isolated wintry showers in the afternoon.

Most of the UK will avoid snowy conditions over Easter but Striding Edge, Helvellyn in the Lake District will remain covered

'We can expect lighter winds through tomorrow. It won't feel too cold but will still be below average for this time of year.'

The floods along the Thames are likely to affect those hoping to watch the Easter Sunday Boat Race if the high water levels continue.

Tomorrow's
clash between the Oxford and Cambridge rowing teams will see the two 
elite universities go head to head in the 159th University Boat Race.

Every
year crowds line the four-and-a-quarter mile course from Putney to 
Mortlake to support the two teams in a race which tends to last just 
over 15 minutes.

Earlier 
this week the Cambridge team were caught out by the Thames tides after 
their vehicles parked up nearby were submerged in water from the 
flooding river.

Both teams have had to take care to 
avoid large pieces of debris coming down the river in high tides as they
prepared for Sunday's contest.

University Boat Race spokesperson Maria O'Connor said: 'As the race is just over four miles long that gives the crowds eight miles of riverside to watch from.

'So while there are areas that may flood, other parts of the stretch will be fine to watch from.

'As high tide is just after 6pm and the race starts at 4.30pm so the race doesn't take place when the tide is at its highest.'

Last year's Boat Race was interrupted
when 36-year-old anti-elitist protester Trenton Oldfield swam in front 
of the rowers. He was handed a six-month prison sentence.

Royal Marines will be drafted in to 
patrol the Boat Race tomorrow as security is beefed up to ensure the 
event is not disrupted by another protester.

Last year's race had to be halted when Trenton Oldfield swam into the 
path of the Oxford and Cambridge university crews, narrowly avoiding 
being struck by an oar.

Organisers have warned against a repeat of anyone taking to the water 
for the 159th race, with the Marines set to patrol eight miles of the 
River Thames in inflatable boats.

Boat Race executive director David Searle said: ‘We are taking 
additional measures this year and have reviewed all of our actions last 
year in detail.

‘The Boat Race course is four and a quarter miles long so we have eight and a half miles of riverbank to manage and monitor.

‘What I would say to anybody thinking of disrupting the race is that 
it's unbelievably dangerous. You risk injuring yourself, the crews and 
the other people following the race.

‘Nobody wants that to happen. This is just a sporting event.’

Oldfield, 36, was released from prison in December having served seven 
weeks of a six-month sentence after being found guilty of causing a 
public nuisance.

He has since been contacted by the Metropolitan Police by letter and on 
Twitter to establish whether he was planning any action this year, 
saying they were ‘keen to facilitate any peaceful protest’.

In a statement, the police stressed they were not offering to organise a
protest but to afford him the opportunity to exercise his ‘lawful 
rights without causing disruption or danger to themselves or others’.

However, Oldfield told The Spectator he would ‘probably have a ramble across the Cotswolds instead’.

Oxford have emerged as clear favourites to win the race after more than 
70 per cent of bets were placed on the Dark Blues, according to bookmaker 
William Hill.

Spokesman Joe Crilly said: ‘Oxford are certainly the best backed crew as
of yet, although that was very much the case at this stage of 
proceedings last year.

‘Last year, however, we took nearly £40,000 on the day of the race and 
Cambridge became best backed by the time the race started. Maybe history
will repeat itself this time around.’

There have been calls for supporters to boycott the Cambridge team over 
claims that it plans to build a new boat house which will threaten 
wildlife.

Mark Avery, the former head of conservation at the RSPB and Cambridge 
student, told the Daily Telegraph that the building project is in danger
of wiping out otters and bitterns on the Great Ouse river.

‘I hope that the Cambridge boat sinks in Sunday's University Boat Race,’ he said.

‘Why? Because the Cambridge University Boat Club is planning to build a 
new boathouse (although it is far more than just a boathouse) on one of 
the best sites for otters in Cambridgeshire, and its impact on local 
wildlife will be severe.’

But Project Ely, the group working to provide the new facility, have 
stressed the boat house would be built sensitively to protect its 
natural surroundings, the paper reported.
