Southampton are interested in Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez as part of the deal for Luke Shaw. 

The Mexico international is wanted by Inter Milan and Valencia but Southampton also need new strikers with Jay Rodriguez injured, Dani Osvaldo expecting to be sold and Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana heading for Liverpool if the latter's fee can be agreed.

On the move? Southampton want Man United striker Javier Hernandez as part of the deal for Luke Shaw

Lallana has expressed a desire to join Liverpool but Southampton want £30m while Liverpool have offered £25m including add-on proposals that Southampton consider unrealistic.

Liverpool are hopeful of concluding a £16.5m deal for Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno over the coming days.
