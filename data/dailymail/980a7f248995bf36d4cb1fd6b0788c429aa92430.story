Dismissal: Hannah Whiteman, 24, (with her husband Danny) was awarded £18,000 after a tribunal

A young mother has been awarded more than £18,000 after she was sacked by a bakery when she became pregnant.

Hannah Whiteman said her boss told her: ‘This is not the type of job you are able to do while pregnant.’

The 24-year-old claimed she was subjected to ‘fabricated’ complaints about the hygiene of a sandwich van she drove.

Her employer was also accused of cutting her hours and overlooking her for a promotion after she had time off due to morning sickness.

Mrs Whiteman, who lives with husband Danny in Norwich, was dismissed on March 28 and gave birth to daughter Colette on November 4.

She has now been awarded £18,417 after an employment tribunal in Norwich ruled she was unfairly dismissed because of her pregnancy.

Speaking afterwards, she said: ‘I worked Monday to Friday and at times even came back to do a double shift … but they shunned me at the first opportunity. They started to treat me differently from the time I told them I was pregnant.’ She added that the ruling showed employers ‘they should do whatever they can to support [pregnant staff]’.

Mrs Whiteman began working for The Mix Artisan Bakery in Norwich in April last year.

As well as helping in the shop on Saturdays, she drove a sandwich van which traded under the name Fresh2U Ltd.

She discovered she was pregnant in January this year.

Carl Hitchborn, 36, took over running the business from his parents soon afterwards and within days made changes to the items sold from the van.

Mrs Whiteman told the tribunal that shortly afterwards she was given a verbal warning when a customer complained about hygiene standards in her van – an accusation she denies.

She believes the incident was ‘fabricated’ because Mr Hitchborn suspected she was pregnant. 

In February – after bursting into tears when a glass oven door shattered as she was cleaning it – she was called into her boss’s office.

Mrs Whiteman said in a witness statement: ‘I put [my reaction] down to pregnancy hormones.’ 

She said she ‘blurted out’ that she was expecting and was told ‘this was not the type of job’ for pregnant women.

The mother said a manager later told her they ‘didn’t know what they were going to do’ with her. 

Her hours were cut ‘without any negotiation beforehand’ and she was accused of damaging the key of a van, she added.

She was dismissed without notice on March 28, accused of having a month-old sandwich in her van.

At the hearing, Mr Hitchborn said in a statement the ‘sole reason’ for dismissal was ‘unacceptable hygiene standards’. But the panel found in Mrs Whiteman’s favour.
