A pastor awaiting trial in the 1999 death of his first wife was convicted today in the 2008 death of his second wife.

Arthur Schirmer, a former associate pastor at a Methodist church in Reeders, Pennsylvania, blamed his second wife's death on a slow-speed car crash and said that his first wife fell down the stairs. Authorities ultimately charged him with killing both women.

The guilty verdict came on Tuesday after prosecutors argued in court that Schirmer clubbed Betty Schirmer on the head with a crowbar, then loaded her into their PT Cruiser and staged an accident.

Monroe County First Assistant District Attorney Michael Mancuso had asked jurors on Tuesday to convict the 64-year-old of premeditated murder.

However Schirmer's attorney insisted in his closing argument that while his client cheated on 56-year-old Betty he had no motive to kill her.

'Accidents happen,' Brandon Reish told jurors. 'Sometimes there are no explanations. Car accidents, falling down stairs, falling off ladders. People die in accidents every day.'

Schirmer was convicted of first-degree murder and evidence tampering. He pleaded not guilty and maintained his innocence. His attorney pledged to appeal.

The ex-clergyman is charged separately in the 1999 death of his first wife, 50-year-old Jewel Schirmer, and awaits trial in Lebanon County.

Schirmer, a longtime United Methodist pastor, claims that Jewel - his wife of more than 30 years - fell down the basement stairs while vacuuming. He said he found her with the cord of a Shop-Vac wrapped around her ankle.

'That's staging 101,' Mancuso said on Tuesday.

Like Betty Schirmer, he said, Jewel 
Schirmer suffered 'forceful, hard blows to the back of the head. It was 
murder, and it was going to happen again'.

Schirmer
took the stand in his own defense last week and testified that he was 
driving his second wife to the emergency room for treatment of jaw pain in 2008 
when he swerved to avoid a deer and hit a guard rail. Schirmer said that she had removed her seat belt to get comfortable.

Local police initially treated it as a
straightforward car crash. State police began a more thorough 
investigation months later, when a man committed suicide in the pastor's office after learning he was in a relationship with his wife, 
the church secretary.

Authorities ultimately concluded the crash could not have caused Mrs Schirmer's extensive head and brain injuries.

Police also found her blood on the 
garage floor, along with evidence that someone had tried to clean it up.
Schirmer contends she was cut while helping him move a wood pile weeks 
before the crash.
