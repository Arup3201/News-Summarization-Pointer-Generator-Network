Turning 25 years old is always a bit of a milestone, but rarely one when you get a card from the Queen.

However, Margaret Ware - who celebrates her 25th birthday tomorrow - has actually been alive for 100 years. She is though to be Britain's oldest leap year baby.

The mother of three, grandmother of five and great-grandmother of seven will be having a family get-together to mark the special day tomorrow. And she is still as active as she was 20 years ago.

Memorable milestone: Margaret Ware can expect a letter from the Queen when she turns 25 tomorrow - because she is thought to be the UK's oldest leap year baby

Every day Mrs Ware gets up by about 7.30am to go for her daily walk. She also worked until she was 80 years old.

Her daughter Sylvia, 72, said: 'I don't know of anybody else who'll be 100 on their 25th birthday, it's certainly unusual.

'She's very active still. She goes out for a walk every day. Twice a week she plays Bingo. She worked until she was 80 in a shop too.

'Hopefully long life runs in the family.'

Still going strong: Margaret still gets up at 7.30am every day to go for a morning stroll

Mrs Ware from Crediton, Devon, was born, grew up and got married in Lymington, Hampshire.

When she left school at the age of 14 she went straight into service, later working in a fish and chip shop.That was when fish and chips cost just one shilling, five pence in today's money.

Seventh of 10 children, Mrs Ware, whose maiden name was Kingswell, was married at the age of 22 in 1933.

She met husband, John, in Southampton and
lived there until John died at the age of 78, not long after they had 
celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. Mrs Ware moved to Crediton to
be near her daughter 28 years ago.

The great-grandmother was too young to remember much about World War One, but World War Two was literally on her doorstep.

Her husband worked at Southampton Airport building aeroplanes during the war and the family lived close-by.

'On one occasion when the airport was bombed, our house was well shaken,' said Mrs Ware.

The 99-year-old says she has had a good and a hard life, but she wouldn't have changed a second.
