A graffiti artist made famous when he was photographed in handcuffs kissing his girlfriend during a modern day Bonnie and Clyde moment outside court must complete eight days community service.

The remarkable image of Russell Murphy, 26, kissing Alexis Creque, 28, as the couple were led into Manhattan Criminal Court by police officers last August was an online hit.

Murphy was back in the New York court yesterday and admitted two misdemeanours - possession of a graffiti instrument and criminal mischief - and was sentenced to eight days of community service.

Modern day Bonnie and Clyde: This photograph of Russell Murphy and Alexis Creque was an online hit

He had been arrested with Creque while spraying 'CASH4' on Williamsburg Bridge, and was charged with the offence.

Murphy was later changed in connection with tags on Manhattan Bridge and a building in Eldridge Street.

His plea entered this week covered all three cases, although he still face charges in connection with graffiti in Brooklyn and Queens.

But if Murphy stays out of trouble for the next year, the offences will be reduced to a violation and wiped from his record.

Sentenced: Murphy was given eight hours community service by Manhattan Criminal Court

The Daily News recorded his lawyer, Stacey Richmad, as saying: 'Ultimately my client should be left with no criminal record and be able to continue on with his life.

She added that it is 'unfortunate; that Murphy will be 'forever shackled' because of the photograph.

The photographer, Mo Gelder, from Brooklyn, wanted to enter the picture into Canon's prestigious competition, Project Imagina10, but has been refused permission by the couple.

His image drew comparisons with Bonnie Parker and Clyde Chestnut Barrow, notorious outlaws from the United States' Great Depression era of the 1930s.

The young lovers Bonnie and Clyde went on a crime-spree over the course of two years and were romanticised by some sections of the public - with many viewing them as Robin Hood-like figures.

Street photographer Mr Gelder had been outside the court last August to take a picture of the accused Manhattan Madam, Anna Gristina.

He was standing next to dozens of other snappers but happened to be looking in the right direction.

Charges against Creque are pending.
