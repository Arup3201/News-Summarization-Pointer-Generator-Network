A grieving daughter has been ordered to pay £3,000 to a nursing home because she did not give a month’s notice of her father’s death.

Sue Cann, 54, was told she had incurred the costs because a period of 28 days had to be paid in the event of a resident ‘moving out or passing away’.

She received the bill the day after the funeral of her father, Kenneth, who died last month aged 79.

Before his death he had spent 17 months at the care home, for which he paid £63,000 of his own money.

The Highcliffe Nursing Home sent a letter asking for payment, that Ms Cann received the day after her father's funeral

Yesterday Miss Cann told of her shock at being billed for failing to warn in advance that her father was going to die. She said it was both callous and ridiculous that Highcliffe Nursing Home in Highcliffe, Dorset, was demanding the hefty sum.

Miss Cann said: ‘Nobody knows when they are going to die. It’s ridiculous. In effect they are saying that you have to pay 28 days after you have passed away. That is so callous.’

Mr Cann, who worked for British Gas for 42 years, was admitted to the seaside nursing home, which is run by Suffolk-based Kingsley Healthcare, after a long battle with dementia. He died on January 30, nine months after his wife Winnie, 74, lost her battle with ovarian cancer.

His daughter, from Christchurch, Dorset, said: ‘Dad worked very hard and he saved as much money as he could for his retirement. Then he developed dementia and most of his money had to be spent on his nursing home fees. It’s terribly sad. My mother signed the contract before she died and I don’t know if she was aware of this  28-day clause.

‘Often you sign things and don’t check the small print. We were more concerned at the time that Dad had a place to go.’

She added: ‘He seemed happy there. He 
was well looked after and I have no complaints of their care. It’s the 
issue of the demand for the money. It leaves a nasty taste in your 
mouth.’

Miss Cann, who works as a dog groomer,
has been told she owes £3,052.16. She said she understands the home 
would incur costs in the time between the death of her father and the 
arrival of another resident.

However, she added: ‘I wouldn’t mind paying for a week. But to pay for a month – which covers his food, laundry and nursing care – is daylight robbery.’

And to receive the letter the day after the funeral ‘was insensitive’, Miss Cann added.

The chief executive of the National Care Association said Kingsley Healthcare’s policy was not standard practice.

Demand: The bill showing the outstanding amount for 27 days of February

Sheila Scott said: ‘Contracts will say 
that residents need to give a month’s notice if they are going to leave.
That is fair and reasonable. However, when somebody dies it is a 
completely different matter. I would expect a week to ten days. Time to 
clear the room, that’s what the extra days should be for.’

Last night Miss Cann said she had not heard from Kingsley Healthcare since it was made aware of her complaint.

The company seemed, however, to be changing some of its policies. CEO Daya Thayan said: ‘I deeply regret any distress caused to Miss Cann and can confirm that we are in contact with her.

‘Charging for notice periods is standard industry practice and is necessary to allow care homes to keep rooms available for access by families to remove personal possessions before arrangements are made to re-let the accommodation.’

He added the notice period for death will now be reduced to seven days. The firm will also wait longer after a death to issue a letter to the next of kin.
