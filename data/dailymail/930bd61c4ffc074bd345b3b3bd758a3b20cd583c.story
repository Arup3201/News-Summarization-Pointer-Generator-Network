Border agents are on alert after an unusual amount of rain created a 60ft hole in a fence that divides the U.S. and Mexico.

The storms began on Friday in Sonora, Mexico, and didn't stop until Sunday morning, causing debris from the Mexican side of the border to pile up against the border fence. 

The fence, which is just west of the Nogales-Mariposa Port of Entry near Interstate 19, was between 18ft and 26ft high and extended at least 7ft underground.

Border agents were alerted not long after the wall fell down.

U.S. Border Patrol spokesman Nicole Ballistrea said: 'Resources have been deployed to the area until the fence is repaired. 

'Our technology assets such as cameras are also able to assist us.'Contractors have assessed the damaged section of the fence and are developing a plan to initiate repairs.'

The fence was built in 2011 but it is constantly monitored by agents because smugglers attempt to cross it illegally by trying to knock parts of it down.

John Hayes, floodplain coordinator for the Santa Cruz County Flood Control District, said: 'It had a lot of water behind it and it just pushed the fence straight down.

'If you're fencing is tight enough to catch debris, it basically becomes a dam. It's not meant to withstand those loads of water.'

Hayes said the fence appears to have floodgates but they did not open.

The debris and water that made its way through the fence also crept into a Nogales, Arizona, neighborhood, flooding houses and business with up to three feet of water.

It is not yet known how much the damage caused will cost to repair.
