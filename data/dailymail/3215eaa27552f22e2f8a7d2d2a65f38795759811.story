Val Kilmer reappeared on social media Sunday in a Twitter picture with the message 'This was taken last Friday when I was released from the hospital and on my way home. FREEDOM!!!!'

The tweet came days after the Batman star had reportedly been rushed to a hospital after he began bleeding from the throat due to a tumor for which family told TMZ the 55-year-old had been refusing treatment since the summer because of his religious convictions.

The  Christian Science adherent was last heard from following his admittance to UCLA intensive care late last month for a 'complication' the needed observation 'under the watchful eye of the UCLA ICU.'

Freedom! Val Kilmer tweeted this photo Sunday along with a message to followers that he'd been released from the hospital

In his January 31 Facebook post, Kilmer denied having undergone treatment for a tumor.

He wrote: 'Thank you for all your sweet support. But I have not had a tumor, or a tumor operations, or any operation.'

The star did not shed any more light on what he was at the medical center for, but those around him are keeping a tight-lip about the matter.

He added:  'Friends have assisted who know my spiritual convictions and have been most sensitive and kind for the extra effort in making sure there’s minimum gossip and silly talk.

'I am praying for a speedy return to the boards as they say. God bless you all and please don’t worry. Love and deep affection , Val.'

However, according to TMZ, 'Doctors performed surgery and he's currently recovering.' 

When the Kiss Kiss Bang Bang star was in small claims court in October he told a judge he was unable to speak because his tongue was swollen.

He was in court because of a dispute that had to do with his home and renovations made there.

Not in the best health? In December, while at an LA Clippers game, the 55-year-old star had a grey sweater tied around his neck and TMZ claims family members of his told them he's got a tumor in his neck that he won't treat because of his Christian Science convictions

In December, while at an LA Clippers game, he had a grey sweater tied around his neck.
