Baking queen: Mary Berry has said she buys her filo pastry from Greek shops in London

When it comes to baking, it seems there is nothing Mary Berry does not know – and cannot do.

Yet the doyenne of the BBC’s Great British Bake Off has stunned fans by admitting that there is one challenge so tricky even she refuses to take it on: making filo pastry.

Mary, 77, who trained at Le Cordon Bleu school in France when she was 17 and has published more than 70 cookery books, revealed that filo is the one thing she buys ready-made from shops.

The paper-thin pastry is notoriously difficult to make from scratch as it needs to be so delicate you can read a page through it.

Mary told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I never make filo pastry because it takes so much effort and I am short of time.

‘I think the last time I did make it from scratch was when I was a teenager training at cookery school. Instead, I buy it for about £2 from Greek shops in London. I then use what I need and keep the rest in the freezer.

‘Home-made filo takes too much time and skill. When I was a teenager at cookery school, I and the other students had so much fun learning to make it. We would slap it on the table and bang it about to work the gluten.’

Mary hinted at purchasing the product on last week’s show when contestants were tasked with  baking strudel.

While the contestants busily carried out the time-consuming preparation, Mary said: ‘It’s the one pastry that I have to confess I would buy.’

Immediately following the admission, users of social network site Twitter voiced their surprise. Jess tweeted: ‘Even Mary Berry buys strudel pastry rather than making it? Now I feel less guilty about the mess that was my cinnamon layer cake!’

And Ms Tutu tweeted: ‘Mary Berry buys her strudel pastry? *falls off sofa in shock*’ While Megan Owen wrote: ‘I just love how Mary Berry said she doesn’t even make her own strudel pastry.’

And Karen Nash wrote: ‘Mary Berry buys filo! #vindication.’

After hearing about the reaction on Twitter, Mary said: ‘I’m sure all the people commenting have got their tongues firmly in their cheek. It’s fantastic that more people are baking at home and if they can use something to cut a corner, then I’ve not got a problem with that.’

Mary also told The Mail on Sunday 
why she thinks the BBC show – where contestants strive to achieve a 
‘good bake’ and avoid the dreaded ‘soggy bottom’ – has become such a 
ratings success. And she revealed what has made her co-judge, baker Paul
Hollywood, an unlikely pin-up.

‘The
reason the show has done so well is because we are not like other 
cookery shows such as Gordon Ramsay’s Hell’s Kitchen, which is full of 
shouting and swearing,’ she said. ‘Paul and I don’t try to intimidate 
people on the show – we praise the contestants for their efforts and try
to teach them how to improve.

‘Recently,
Paul has become a bit of a sex symbol and it’s not difficult to see why
– he is very handsome and he knows what he is talking about.  I really 
enjoy working with him.’
