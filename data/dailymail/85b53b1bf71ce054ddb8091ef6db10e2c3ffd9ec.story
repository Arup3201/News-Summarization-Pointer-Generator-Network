The devastated mother of a 16-year-old girl killed in a hit-and-run broke down in tears and said 'I want my baby back' as she urged the driver to give themselves up.

Shattered Sharon Clark said the callous motorist must be finding the death of her daughter Jade 'hard to live with' and pleaded with them to do the right thing.

Police have launched a manhunt for the driver of the Volvo XC90 4x4 that ploughed into the back of Jade's moped on a busy dual carriageway.

Jade was killed in a hit and run last month. her family have said that her death has left a hole in their lives

Sharon Clark, Jade's mother, made a tearful plea to the driver to come forward and take responsibility

The teenager died almost instantly from severe head injuries after she was thrown onto the road and was then struck by 'a number' of other cars.

The driver of the £40,000 Volvo failed to stop at the scene on the A31 near Ringwood, Hampshire, and sped off.

Police said the luxury car would have suffered significant damage and it would be impossible for the person behind the wheel not to have been aware of the collision.

Heartbroken Mrs Clark urged the driver to come forward.

She
said: 'For a driver to cause Jade's accident and then drive away, 
leaving her alone in the road, is almost too difficult to believe.

'To that driver, I would say please, please come forward and contact the police. You must be finding this hard to live with, especially if you have children of your own.

'To anyone else who knows this driver, or knows where the car might be, please contact the police as soon as possible.'

Mrs Clark then wept and said 'I want my baby back' as she was hugged by her husband, Jade's stepdad, Daniel Clark.

Her
ex-husband and Jade's father Billy Herrald and the teenager's 
grandmother Linda Pidgley also broke down in tears at a press 
conference.

Jade, who was 
studying hairdressing at college and was also a young firefighter, was 
riding her red TGB Scooter at the time at 8.20pm on Sunday, February 24.

She had only past her motorcycle driving test a couple of months before the fatal crash and was travelling from her home in Ringwood to a party three miles away in St Ives, Dorset.

Inspector Matt Butler, of Dorset police's traffic unit, said they did not know if the Volvo driver was male or female.

He said: 'Jade was riding her moped on the A31 and she was hit from behind by the Volvo.

'A number of vehicles were involved in the incident and one of these, a Volvo XC90, failed to stop at the scene. 

'There was nothing unusual about Jade's driving that night. We know she was travelling to a party to St Ives from her home.

'The
collision would have caused damage to the front of the vehicle. The 
driver of that vehicle is out there and we need to speak to that person 
as soon as we can.

'The Volvo could have been anywhere from around the south coast and could also have been from London.

'Jade's family are absolutely distraught.'

Mrs Clark revealed the devastation felt by the family. She said: 'From the moment we were given this awful news, the family have been devastated.

'Jade was such a loving girl. Losing her has left a hole in our hearts and our lives that we will never fill.

'She was a wonderful daughter; step-daughter; sister, grand-daughter and friend.

'To lose Jade the way we did is what's hardest to bare.'

Jade, who was a black belt in karate, had been a member of the Young Firefighters Association based at Ringwood.

Mr Herald, Jade's father, said: 'She had her whole life in front of her. She'd not been riding the bike long, probably a couple of months I think.

'It's just so sad. I just hope she didn't suffer.

'Jade was always a very happy child, cheeky. She never wanted for anything. She was just always happy and content with what she had. It's such a cruel, cruel world.'
