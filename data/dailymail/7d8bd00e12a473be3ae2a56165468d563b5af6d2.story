It was a case of Cristiano Ronaldo winning his battle with Lionel Messi but Barcelona emerging victors in the war with Real Madrid after El Clasico at the Nou Camp on Sunday in Spain.

Goals from Jeremy Mathieu and Luis Suarez gave Barcelona a 2-1 win to move four points ahead of Madrid atop La Liga with 10 games remaining but it was only Ronaldo who got his name on the scoresheet, after a quieter display by Messi's imperious standards.

Messi appeared relaxed in the tunnel, dabbling in conversation with his Barcelona team-mates, his fleece zipped up to his chin. Ronaldo stood poised, staring forward. The Nou Camp was an inferno, shrouded in gold, purple and blue with the 99,000 supporters in fearsome voice as the two superpowers of global football marched out on the pitch.

Ronaldo's first touch of the ball after 40 seconds was met with searing jeers by the Barcelona fans. He was eventually crowded out by Dani Alves and Ivan Rakitic and the dispossession of Madrid's talisman was met with emphatic cheers.

Messi's start was subdued, the diminutive Argentina international lingering quietly in the centre of the pitch, exchanging the occasional pass with Andres Iniesta in the first five minutes.

But he snapped into life in the sixth minute with a nutmeg on Madrid playmaker Toni Kroos.

Six minutes later, the first clear chance of the game fell to Ronaldo, who escaped his defender on the back post but could only turn Karim Benzema's deft lob onto the crossbar with Claudio Bravo beaten. He should have scored and Barcelona were off the hook.

Messi was still awaiting his first opportunity to get at Madrid's defence. Nutmeg aside, his first 15 was perhaps best summed up by Iniesta uncharacteristically hitting a looping pass over his team-mate, who had found space out on the right touchline.

But two minutes later, Messi had the ball at his feet and he surged inside, picked out Neymar and burst into the area, where he met the cross with his head but sent it wide.

Barcelona's breakthrough came on 19, and Messi had the assist. Suarez was fouled  on the left, Messi whipped a glorious ball into the area and Mathieu flicked it past Iker Casillas to give Luis Enrique's side the lead.

It was Messi's 15th assist of the season and Ronaldo's miss after 12 minutes already appeared costly.

The goal galvanised Barcelona and Suarez drew a foul from Pepe two minutes after the opener and Messi seized the ball again. This time he was central and 25 yards out but his effort was deflected out for a corner which came to nothing.

Neymar missed a glorious chance for 2-0 on the half hour mark, meeting a ball across goal from Suarez six yards out, only to guide his effort safely into the hands of Casillas with the goal gaping.

It was a shocking miss and 30 seconds later, Madrid were level.

Ronaldo led the surge forward and as Benzema collected possession on the right of the penalty area, the Portugal international continued his run through the centre.

Benzema sensed his presence and picked out his run with a glorious swish of his heel. Ronaldo hit fifth gear to beat Bravo to the ball, poking it under the goalkeeper to haul Madrid level as the jeers spewed out at the Nou Camp.

Eight minutes before half time, Ronaldo picked up the ball on the left and skipped past Alves but with Javier Mascherano and Gerard Pique closing him down, Ronaldo went tumbling. 

Television replays showed that Pique momentarily left his boot dangling, perhaps to entice a Ronaldo fall but the referee's decision to book the Madrid man was correct.

In the 40th minute, Ronaldo thought he had assisted a goal from Gareth Bale, who poked Ronaldo's header into the back of the net. Bale was definitely onside but Ronaldo was not and the goal was rightly ruled out.

But the Madrid man was finishing the first half in scintillating form. A ferocious shot from 30 yards out was tipped over by Bravo and Bale skewed a shot wide from the corner.

As the second half began, it seemed Messi was in the shadow of Ronaldo. Madrid undoubtedly ended the first period of play in the ascendency.

And it was Ronaldo who was involved in the first incident of the second phase, returning the ball into Benzema in a probing attacking move, before Bravo dived to his left to beat out the France striker's clever shot across goal.

Messi was drifting deep to find the ball, and Mascherano picked out his compatriot on the halfway line on 52 minutes.

He turned and sprinted at the heart of Madrid's back line and Luka Modric reached for the ball with his leg but only managed to clip Messi's heels. The free kick failed to worry Madrid like Messi's sprint forward did.

Four minutes later, Barcelona went ahead with a tremendous finish from Suarez.

The Uruguay striker was found by a forensic pass by Alves, who spotted Suarez had escaped the attention of Pepe and had curved his run to stay on side.

The ball was floated over, Suarez caressed it under control with the outside of his boot and threaded it across Casillas and into the far corner.

Ronaldo might have been worried after a clash with Mascherano on the hour mark. He was flattened by the midfielder but appeared to retaliate, with Mascherano exaggerating the contact made by the Madrid attacker.

But the referee was not fooled, only booking the Barcelona man for the initial foul.

Tempers began to fray after the clash between the pair and it suited Messi's Barcelona side more as the clock ticked on. 

As 73 minutes passed, Messi went inches away from extending Barcelona's lead.

Again out on the right, he ran inside and sprinted ominously through the centre before unleashing a fine strike from the edge of the area that went the wrong wide of the post with Casillas beaten.

Barcelona manager Luis Enrique thought the shot was in and a minute later, he must have been certain his team were about to add to their advantage.

Messi was again the engineer, perhaps buoyed by his attempt seconds earlier. With Suarez to his left and Neymar to his right, Messi played in the Brazil international, who blazed wide on an unusually wasteful night from the former Santos man.

The pair combined again on 77, this time Messi shooting at goal but his low, right-footed strike was blocked and Madrid cleared.

Benzema almost punished Barcelona and Messi for spurning their chances when his shot from 25 yards deflected wickedly off Mascherano, but Bravo managed to turn the ball away brilliantly.

Messi was creating again four minutes from full time, unlocking Madrid's defence with a neat pass into Jordi Alba, who was denied by Casillas.

Barcelona were pouring forward looked to extend their advantage. They did not manage to do so, but Messi's side held on. 

He might not have settled his duel with Ronaldo, but it is advantage Barcelona in the race for the La Liga title.
