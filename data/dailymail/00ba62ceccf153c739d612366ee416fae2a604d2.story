After winning the 3,000 meter steeplechase you would expect most athletes to be in a jubilant mood.

But despite winning the gold medal at the European championships in Helsinki, Finland, French runner Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad still seemed far from happy.

As the 27-year-old steeplechaser crossed the finish line a 14-year-old female dressed as the Championships' mascot 'Appy' stood nearby with a gift bag to congratulate him.

Crossing the finish line: Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad won gold in the 3,000 metre steeplechase at the European Championships in Helsinki

Well-wisher: A 14-year-old girl dressed as the Championships' mascot 'Appy' approaches the athlete with a gift bag

Unsporting: Mekhissi-Benabbad moves to slap the bag out of the mascot's hand

But rather than celebrate his 8.33.23-minute victory, Mekhissi-Benabbad knocked the bag out of the girl's hand and shoved her backwards.

The girl inside the mascot costume was believed to have been slightly winded by the unexpected attack but otherwise unharmed.

A member of the public caught the hold exchange on camera on Sunday and posted it on YouTube.

Forceful: Mekhissi-Benabbad then shoves the unsuspecting girl

Not 'Appy': The schoolgirl only just manages to stay on her feet during the attack

Championship director Mika Muukka said: 'Hopefully, the EAA would deal with the case. Such behaviour is completely unacceptable.'

Itâ€™s not the first time Mekhissi-Benabbad has become a YouTube sensation for all the wrong reasons.

Last year the 27-year old got into a fight with countryman Medhi Baala on the finish line of the 1500 meters at the Monaco Diamond League games that was caught on tape.

Benabadd was suspended for 10 months following that incident.

Temper: The athlete then storms off leaving the stunned mascot to recover
