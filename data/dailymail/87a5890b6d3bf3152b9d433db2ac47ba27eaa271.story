It promised to be a clash of the titans, the bare-chested black belt from Russia versus Australia's boxer-in-chief who is as likely to be seen surfing as in Canberra.

But when Vladimir Putin and Tony Abbott nearly met on the first day of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference in Beijing there was a disappointing lack of aggravation - and certainly no shirtfronting.

The nearest thing to any perceived slight was Mr Abbott's rather awkward stance as he twisted away from the Moscow hardman at an official photocall.

And there was no doubt that the most controversial element of the traditional 'family photo' was the outfits.

Many were quick to point out that the 21 delegates, clad in Chinese tunics, bore an uncanny resemblance to the cast of Star Trek rather than a group of world leaders about to embark on a gruelling round of diplomacy.

'Obama wearing Star Trek jacket in China? Someone please beam him up,' wrote Steve Miller on Twitter.

However, AFP journalist Katy Lee pointed out that the APEC has a 'rich tradition' in dressing its members traditional clothing of the country holding the summit.

'Important to remember Obama's suit is part of rich tradition of flamboyant APEC fashion. See Kerry, 2013,' she wrote, referring to the Balinese 'endek' woven shirt worn by Secretary of State John Kerry and leaders attending the summit in Indonesia last year.

Earlier the same day, Mr Putin didn't look too nervous about a confrontation with the Australian PM when he was spotted shaking hands, smiling for photos and even comparing phones with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe,  China's president Xi Jinping and  Chilean President Veronica Michelle Bachelet Jeria.

Mr Abbott last night touched down in China's capital after promising 'very robust' talks with Mr Putin.

'The conversation will be, as I have said, about our absolute expectation that Russia will be as good as its word, that it will fully cooperate with the investigations that are under way and that it will do what it can to ensure that justice is done,' Mr Abbott said on Saturday.

'This is not an issue which Russia now expects to be forgotten, that this is not an atrocity which Russia thinks can be swept under the carpet'. 

'Australians turned (to us) with an official request for a meeting during an APEC summit and we are agreeing to such a meeting in China,' Putin's top foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov said.

'It will be short,' he added.

Vladimir Putin is also expected to arrive at Beijing on Tuesday to discuss the MH17 disaster and fallout with Mr Abbott

The Prime Minister grabbed global headlines after threatening to 'shirtfront' the Russian president but has since toned down his language.

Instead, he insisted he would hold robust talks with the Russian president over the country's actions.

Russian backed separatists shot down the plane over east Ukraine on July 17, killing all 298 people aboard including 38 Australians.

After consulting with other G20 members, Mr Abbott confirmed Mr Putin would not be banned from the economic leaders' summit next week.

Mr Abbott said as the G20 is an international organisation which works on consensus, Australia does not have the right to bar any member from attending.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said the shirtfront comment went too far.

Mr Abbott has flagged a 'robust conversation' and wants Mr Putin to guarantee he's doing everything possible to help investigations

'In some ways that weakened our legitimate outrage,' he told ABC TV on Sunday.

He hopes Mr Abbott uses the meeting as an opportunity to get to the bottom of what happened.

'Putin's not going to tell us the truth,' he said.

'But Tony Abbott has to at least ask.'

The APEC summit marks the beginning of a whirlwind week of diplomacy for Mr Abbott

Australia should be lobbying for peace in Ukraine, as a silver lining to the 'senseless barbarity', Mr Shorten said.

Recovery and investigative work at the crash site has been halted because of fighting between the government and pro-Russian separatists, despite a September ceasefire.

The APEC summit, which begins on Monday and will focus on economic cooperation, marks the beginning of a whirlwind week of diplomacy for Mr Abbott, who will also visit Myanmar for Asian security talks before returning to Australia to host the G20 in Brisbane.
