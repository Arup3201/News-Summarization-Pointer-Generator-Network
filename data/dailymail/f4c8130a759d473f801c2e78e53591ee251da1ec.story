Victims of crime groups have attacked a call from euthanasia campaigner Philip Nitschke to let killers serving life sentences choose the timing of their own 'peaceful' deaths behind bars.

Dr Nitschke has said Australian inmates facing life in jail should be given the same opportunity as a Belgian rapist and murderer who a court has granted the right to die with the help of prison doctors.

Killer Frank van den Bleeken raped and murdered a 19-year-old woman after being released from serving sentences for other sexual offences. Released again, he attacked three more victims, including an 11-year-old girl. 

Now locked up indefinitely 23 hours a day, van den Bleeken successfully applied to a Belgian court for the right to die at a time of his choosing rather than endure what he describes as unbearable psychological suffering in jail.

Murderer and rapist Frank van den Bleeken has been granted permission by a Belgian court to die at the hands of prison doctors.

Dr Nitschke said on Monday he believed Australian prisoners facing life in jail without parole should be given the same opportunity as van den Bleeken. Not to do so was 'equivalent to torture'.

'When I first heard that the prisoner was going to be allowed to have his request to have a peaceful death respected, I was very pleased in the sense that it was something that I've believed for some time – that a person who is incarcerated for an indefinite period and that's certainly his case [should be able to have the option of euthanasia],' he told the ABC.

'It looks to me like the state is not only prepared to incarcerate people forever in certain circumstances, but to try and maximise the suffering of those individuals, and I don't think we should have any part of that, at least in these situations, offer these poor people the option of a peaceful death.

'To me, that's equivalent to torture and I think it's something that the state should not be involved in.'

Euthanasia campaigner Philip Nitschke wants Australian inmates serving life sentences to be allowed to choose the timing of their own deaths behind bars.

Peter Rolfe, president of the Support After Murder group, was appalled. 'I find it most abhorrent,' Mr Rolfe told Daily Mail Australia. 'Most abhorrent. I just find that unbelievable.'

In August 1994, Mr Rolfe's one-time business partner Stephen Dempsey was shot dead with a crossbow bolt by Richard Leonard, who months later stabbed a cab driver to death before he was arrested, convicted and sentenced to life in jail.

Mr Rolfe said Dr Nitschke's description of convicted murderers as 'poor people' who deserved the option of 'a peaceful death' was offensive. 

'What about people like Stephen Dempsey who wasn't offered a peaceful death?' Mr Rolfe said.

'I mean, Richard Leonard is in jail as punishment, as well as for the protection of the community. He wrecked our lives and we just want to see him never get out of jail. We want him to pay the price for it.

'I don't feel for these "poor people". They are criminals who have sinned against society, for God's sake.' 

Killer and rapist Frank van den Bleeken has been granted his wish to be put to death by prison doctors rather than endure 'unbearable psychological suffering' in jail.

Howard Brown, vice president of the Victims of Crime Assistance League, said Dr Nitschke's comments failed to recognise the importance of both deterrence and punishment in sentencing for serious crimes.

Mr Brown said it would be illogical to allow a convicted murderer the right to take another life, even if that life were their own. 'I still have a huge problem with anyone taking another person's life,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 

Philip Nitschke says keeping killers locked up indefinitely without the right to euthanasia is 'equivalent to torture'.

Dr Nitschke is reportedly to be investigated by police forces in every Australian state over his role in almost 20 deaths of the past three years.
