They may be the smallest Easter bunnies in town, but these tiny rabbits have made a huge impact in their owners' lives - even helping them battle post-natal depression.

The tiny lionhead and mini lop rabbit breeds - the biggest measuring just five inches long and weighing 3oz - were the unlikely saviours of bunny-mad best friends Megan Hull, 27, and Jessica Brown, 31.

The pair, both mothers of three, initially bought a couple of rabbits each as pets for their young children, but were shocked to find how caring for the fluffy creatures helped them overcome post-natal depression.

After meeting through mutual friends four years ago, Jessica and Megan bonded over a love of animals, but it was only after the births of their youngest children they realised how much looking after the rabbits was helping them.

A year-and-a-half ago, the pals from Bradford, West Yorkshire, decided to start breeding rabbits as a serious hobby and set up a small business, Bunnytales Rabbit Ranch selling the animals as pets.

Megan, mother to Jake, ten, Jodie-Leigh, nine and Sophia-Rose, two, battled with depression after the birth of Sophia-Rose, just as Jessica was facing the same problems after having her son Mason, also two.

But support worker Megan, also studying psychology at university, said somehow the rabbits helped the pair through their darkest times.

'How can you ever be sad when you have those little eyes looking up at you?' she said.

'I am very grateful for doing this and don't know where I would be without them.

'They are my little furry babies.'

Jessica, a stay-at-home mother to Jace, nine, McKay, five, and Mason, is now pregnant with her fourth child. She says she'll be eternally grateful for the effect the rabbits had on her mental health.

'I've suffered from anxiety throughout life and sometimes unexpected things can calm you,' she says.

'When
 you're off work and pregnant it's hard if you're used to being busy, 
but the rabbits give you something to focus on and something to do.'

After they bonded, the women decided 
to set up Bunnytales because their furry pets had given them so much 
joy, they wanted to give something back.

'We want to give families and children as much joy through owning them as we get,' says Jessica.

'These rabbits have helped bring us together and pull each other through it.'

Jessica
 and Megan breed a new litter of rabbits each month and sell them to 
families all over the country after rearing them from birth.

They mated their first pair eight 
months ago, then decided to study breeding and are now aiming to produce 
adorable bunnies in every colour possible.

And, as if that wasn't enough, the animal lovers are now trying to teach their rabbits tricks.

'People have a misconception of rabbits,' Jessica said.

'Rabbit are very clever,' says Jessica.

'You can house train them, get them to do tricks and can teach them show jumping.'

Megan even has tunnels set up for them in her bedroom.

'I never thought these would be the release we both needed but it's amazing what a walk into the garden to give them a stroke can do for you,' says Jessica.

'We're never going to look back.'
