An Arizona mom who was convicted of the 2013 murder of her husband - having enlisted the help of her two children and their friends to kill him - was sentenced to life is prison for the crime on Friday.

The case of 43-year-old Michelle Dawn Gibson is eerily similar to that of Pamela Smart, the New Hampshire woman who infamously conspired with her 15-year-old lover and three of his friends to murder her husband in 1990.

Dawn was found guilty in November of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder.

Her husband, Steven Gibson Sr., was beaten with a baseball bat, stabbed multiple times and had his throat slit, police said.

Life without parole: Arizona mom Michelle Dawn Gibson, 43, was sentenced to natural life in prison on Friday for  plotting with her children and a group of teens to murder her husband, Steven Gibson Sr, in 2013

He was found dead in the family's home in Peoria -  northeast of Phoenix - on March 1, 2013.

Michelle Gibson called 911 early in the morning to say she had returned home from shopping trip with her children to find her husband dead in the garage.

However, as police were setting up the crime scene, Erik McBee, 17, arrived at the house covered in blood and confessed to the murder. 

Court documents said Gibson and her teenage son and daughter planned the murder, with the mother alleging domestic violence and saying she feared her husband would kill her.

Gibson had offered McBee, a friend of her children, and another teen, Karen Molina-Pompa, $2,000 to carry out the murder, according to AZ Central.

Prosecutors argued at trial that Gibson had gone on the shopping trip to establish an alibi.

McBee and Molina-Pompa were left in the house as Gibson Sr. went to sleep.

Molina-Pompa is accused of holding Gibson Sr. at gunpoint while McBee repeatedly hit him in the head with a metal baseball bat, the court was told.

Gibson's son, Steven Gibson Jr., 17, then returned to the home, after being called by McBee, and stabbed his father in the chest.

Accessory: Steven Gibson Jr., 17, was sentenced to 22 years prison in July last year for stabbing his father, Steven Gibson Sr., 39 (together-right), to death, as part of a plot organized by his mom

Violent: Steven Gibson Sr. was awaiting aggravated assault charges at the time of his death. Wife Michelle Gibson said she believed he would kill her

McBee then cut his throat.

The 911 call was made after Gibson and her daughter, Alysa, arrived home and attempted to destroy the evidence. 

The son pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and hindering prosecution and was sentenced to 22 years in prison. 

McBee pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and agreed to testify against Michelle Gibson. 

He is currently awaiting sentencing.

Alysa Gibson and Molina-Pompa are both awaiting trial.

Deadly siblings: Alysa Gibson and Steven Gibson Jr. have been separately charged in the murder

Murder plot: Michelle Gibson (front) plotted with her children, including son Steven (back) and a group of teens to murder her husband, Steven Gibson Sr, at their home in Peoria, Arizona, in 2013

At the trial, prosecutors accused Gibson of manipulating her children and their friends into believing that Steven Gibson Sr. was going to kill her first if they did not act, court records show.

Gibson accused her husband of domestic violence.

He was  facing aggravated-assault charges at the time of his death.

Prosecutors said Gibson wanted to be single and date men she had met online. 

Police said she began registering for online dating sites four months before her husband's murder and had listed her status as a 'widow'.

The victim's mother, Charlene Gibson, read out an emotional speech at the sentencing hearing Friday. 

'The morning of the murder Michelle put on Facebook, knowing what was going to happen to him that night, ''It's a beautiful day to live in Arizona'', and I want to say today for her sentencing, ''Yes it is a beautiful day to live in Arizona, because I won't ever have to see you anymore'',' Mrs Gibson said, according to AZ Central.

Gibson was sentenced to natural life in prison without parole.

The way the saga unfolded is incredibly similar to the story of Pamela Smart.

Eerily similar: New Hampshire woman Pamela Smart infamously conspired with her 15-year-old lover and three of his friends to murder her husband, Greggory Smart (pictured together) in 1990

On May 1, 1990, Smart said she returned home to her New Hampshire apartment to find it had been burgled and that her husband of one year, Greggory Smart, had been murdered. 

She worked as a media coordinator at Winnacunnet High School in Hampton.

Police started following a lead that she had seduced a 15-year-old, William 'Billy' Flynn. 

It later emerged Smart had threatened to stop having sex with Flynn unless he killed her husband.

Flyn and three friends - Patrick 'Pete' Randall, Vance 'J.R.' Lattime Jr., and Raymond Fowler. - shot and killed Greggory Smart.

The plot was eventually after another teenager, Cecilia Pierce, who knew about what happened, agreed to wear a wire to entrap Pamela Smart.

A 1992 novel inspired by the events, To Die For by Joyce Maynard, was made into a film starring Nicole Kidman.
