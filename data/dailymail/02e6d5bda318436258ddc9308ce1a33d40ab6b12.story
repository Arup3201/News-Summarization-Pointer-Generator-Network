It hardly looks like the most comfortable of places to build a home, but these two crows decided to build their nest on top of a yacht's mast.

The pair of feathered home-makers obviously took the nautical term quite literally when they decided to make good use of the 'crow's nest' of a vessel moored at Aberystwyth harbour, in mid-Wales.

Staff at the marina said it is the first time they have seen an actual crow's nest built on the top of a yacht's mast.

What a position: These two birds obviously took the nautical term quite literally when they decided to build their home on the crow's nest of a yacht

The crows are understood to have built the nest about two weeks ago, but have only just started sitting in it this week indicating the possibility of eggs.

As it looks to be a breeding pair, the crows may not yet number enough to be described by their collective name of 'a murder of crows' but should the eggs hatch, the yacht could quickly become an aviary.

'Why they'd want to build a nest there is beyond me,' said David Jenkins who works at the marina.

'There is a little platform at the top but it really does get windy in that spot with the strong north easterly winds.

'I've never seen anything like it in all my years working down at the marina.'

The yacht in question is the 'Scorpio', which belongs to Tal-y-bont couple Mick and Jenny Fothergill.

The couple suffered from the devastating effects of last June's flooding and as a result haven't used their yacht because they have been tied up with repairs at their home.

'That's probably why they chose it,' added Mr Jenkins.

'We've had a few ducks making nests on boats over the years but this was a one-off.

'Fingers crossed we might see some chicks, but the danger is then that other birds would continue to use it as a home!'

Russell Jones, from RSPB Ynys-hir nature reserve near Machynlleth, said: 'This is a very unusual nesting site in such an open location. Crows usually nest in trees and bushes which give them some cover and protection.

'Although this site is high enough away from predators, another reason for choosing this spot could be because of easy access to food sources.

'The recent cold weather means that the breeding season has been pushed back slightly so they might be laying eggs over the next few days.'

HMS Victory: Nelson's flagship with crow's nest platforms in Portsmouth

A crow's nest in a ship is built in 
the upper part of the main mast and is used as a lookout point as it 
provides the best view of approaching land, other ships or approaching 
hazards.

Early versions
consisted of merely a barrel or a basket attached to the tallest mast, 
but they later became specially designed platforms, including protective
railings.

According to
naval legend, the term originated in the practice of Viking sailors who
carried crows or ravens in a cage at the top of the mast which would be
released during times of poor visibility.

The ship would then follow the crow as it would usually head towards the nearest land.

Scholars however have argued there is no evidence for this and suggest it was 
first used to describe a barrel platform created by explorer 
William Scoresby in 1807, which resembled a crow's nest in a tree.
