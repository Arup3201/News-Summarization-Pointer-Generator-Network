Allegations: Kelly Scruggs claims she was one of Secret Service Agent Arthur Huntington's lovers

The married CIA officer at the centre of the Colombian prostitute scandal has been accused of bedding two more women behind his wife's back.

Disgraced Secret Service agent Arthur Huntington is alleged to have seduced two women in Texas - and his extramarital conquests are said to have begun during the administration of George W. Bush.

The two separate alleged affairs took place in 2007 and 2008 and, while one of his conquests admitted she knew Huntington was married, the other said he spun her a web of lies to get her into bed.

The latest claims come less than a week after another woman said Huntington pursued her after they met in Dublin, where he had been assigned as part of President Obama's security team during his official visit to Ireland in May 2011.

The CIA officer lost his job last month after he gave a Colombian prostitute just $28 for an $800 tab.

Kelly Scruggs, who labelled Huntington 'a total jerk', described how the agent broke her heart after meeting him at the Wild West club in Waco, Texas, in 2007.

The pair spent a lot of time together during the Bush administration while the President was at the Western White House in Crawford, Texas, it is alleged.

The 33-year-old claimed she and Huntington had seen each other for more than a year but that he cooled the relationship when she introduced him to her mother, the New York Daily News reported.

Blonde Scruggs, from Martin in Texas, only discovered the truth about her lover - who had claimed he was divorced - when news of his prostitution scandal in Colombia broke last month.

She told the New York Daily News: 'I don’t feel sorry for (him). I think he’s a total creep now.'

Meanwhile, fellow Texan Holly Snow, 41, met Huntington at the same bar a year later - about the same time of his break-up with Scruggs.

At first - like with Scruggs - he claimed he was separated from his wife but confessed his true marital status when Snow confronted him with her suspicions.

She claimed Huntington then told her he kept women 'in all 50 states' - while his wife Jolie and their two sons were at home in Maryland.

She told the New York Daily News: 'He said he would never leave his wife because of the kids, the boys.'

She added: 'He was lonely. He is the type of person that needs attention. That’s his personality. He has to have attention.

'He has to have that one someone that is there for him, that makes him think they really care about him.'

Snow said she had a 'funny feeling' Huntington was involved in the Cartagena scandal when news of it broke, adding she put 'two and two together' when he failed to reply to an email she sent him.

Scandal: Dania Suarez claims she was swindled by the U.S. agent who agreed to pay her for sex

Huntington sparked the prostitution scandal in Colombia in April, which brought shame on Obama's administration.

The Secret Service Agent spent the night with Dania Suarez while on duty in South America but paid only $28 of his $800 tab.

His encounter with the escort led to police being called to the luxury Hotel Caribe, and subsequently a major Secret Service investigation where nine agents lost their jobs.

The scandal overshadowed Barack Obama's visit to the Summit of the Americas.

Last week it emerged he allegedly lied about being divorced to bed a Canadian woman he met in Dublin, where he had been assigned as part of the President's security team during his trip to the Irish capital in May 2011.

The woman, who only agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, said the CIA officer's wife deserved to know about the liaison because his indiscretions were 'not a one-time thing'.

The 42-year-old woman, a single mother-of-two, claims she felt 'sick' and 'used' when she discovered his dalliance with the hooker - and that he was married and living in Maryland with his wife and children.
