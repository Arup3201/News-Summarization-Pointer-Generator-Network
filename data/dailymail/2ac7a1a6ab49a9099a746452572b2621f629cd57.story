Ferguson city leaders have pledged to raise money for vest and patrol-car cameras for their police officers in a bid to increase the transparency of their interactions with the community and win back trust.

The promise comes amid violent protests over the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by white police officer Darren Wilson in a quiet street in the St. Louis district on August 9.

'We plan to learn from this tragedy, as we further provide for the safety of our residents and businesses and progress our community through reconciliation and healing,' officials said in a public statement.

'We have been working in the recent days to build upon our many existing community relationships to establish new and healing dialogue, to listen to our community, and commit to long term engagement.'

It added: 'We are exploring a range of actions intended for the community to feel more connected to and demonstrate the transparency of our city departments… including commitment to raise funds and secure dash and vest cams for our patrol cars.'

Complaints about the police fell by 88 per cent in Rialto, California, after officers were equipped with vest cams. 

Protests on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, were significantly calmer on Tuesday night, but the peaceful atmosphere disintegrated amid a series of clashes that led to 47 arrests, with police claiming they were pelted with bottles containing urine.

For most of the night demonstrations were calm with protesters holding signs and chanting, although the majority had taken the advice of leaders to wrap things up by nightfall.

Then just before midnight, the protests took a turn for the worst after some people started throwing plastic bottles at police.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson told CNN that 'criminals' had thrown urine at officers.

Local community activists quickly attempted to defuse the situation by linking arms and standing in between the authorities and the remaining protesters.

Over the next hour or so arrests were made as police, who were out in force once again, attempted to gain control of the situation again.

The crowds were smaller than on previous evenings as the protests continued over the killing of Michael Brown.

'Hands up! Don't shoot' was one again the mantra, although many demonstrators added a second chant: 'We protesters, we don't loot.'

Although plastic bottles were thrown, there were no reports of the teargas and Molotov cocktail exchanges that had blighted recent nights.

Malik Zulu Shabazz, the president of the Black Lawyers for Justice and former chairman of the New Black Panther Party, was out on the streets trying to instill calm into the protesters.

His organization and others, made up mostly of black volunteers, have taken it upon themselves to help ease tensions in Ferguson, confident the protesters are more likely to listen to them than police.

Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Brown's family, said the 18-year-old's funeral and memorial service would be on Monday. The time and location had not been finalized. 

Despite the turmoil in Ferguson, its mayor, James Knowles, declared that the area is not racially divided.

He told MSNBC: 'There's not a racial divide in the city of Ferguson. That is the perspective of all residents in our city. Absolutely.'
