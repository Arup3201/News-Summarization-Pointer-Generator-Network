A judge has issued an arrest warrant for the granddaughter of Coronation Street star Johnny Briggs after she breached a court order.

Judge Peter Moss ordered the apprehension of Emma Beach after she failed to respond to a court summons issued by the Probation Service.

The 26-year-old heroin addict has missed a number of appointments with probationers and drug treatment organisations ordered as part of an earlier sentence handed down for shoplifting.

After she failed to appear in court yesterday, Judge Moss issued the arrest warrant.

In June, Beach had three extra probation sessions added to her sentence for failing to show up to earlier appointments. 

Before the earlier hearing, the court heard that Beach had been arrested with her mother Karen Briggs, accused of stealing £150 worth of meat from a BP Connect shop.  

Rachael Lane, prosecuting, told the court of the latest matter: 'This is a fresh allegation of a breach against Miss Beach, arising from her failure to attend a number of appointments.'

The judge was told Beach had been sent a court summons to her home, in Cobham, Surrey, but no response had been received.

Judge Moss ordered that Beach be arrested and brought to court.

Guildford Crown Court, pictured, heard that Beach, who has 16 convictions,  and her mother Karen Briggs, who has 32 convictions, funded their heroin addiction by stealing from a range of different shops

In January Beach and her mother were arrested over the theft of £400 pounds worth of Yankee Candles from a branch of Clinton Cards, in Walton-on-Thames, as well as for the theft of a parcel belonging to a neighbour.

Briggs was jailed while her daughter was given a treatment order on the grounds that her mother was a bad influence and all of Beach's drug-taking, since she was 14, had involved her mother.

The judge told Beach: 'I know you are injecting into veins which are now beginning to cause difficulties for you.

'We know the risks. You know this could easily kill you. It seems you didn't take that on board.'

Her famous grandfather, who played Mike Baldwin in the popular long-running ITV soap, has long-since given up on his daughter and granddaughter, having previously tried to help them but with no success.

On her last appearance in court, Briggs was told by magistrate Malcolm Stewart: 'I have heard that you want to change and this is your chance. Make the most of it, its going to be difficult.'

Judge Moss has also previously said of Beach: 'I'm sure she would love it if somebody would wave a magic wand and she would no longer be addicted to heroin.

'I don't own that magic wand.'

Beach has 16 convictions for 23 offences while her mother has 32 convictions for 52 offences.
