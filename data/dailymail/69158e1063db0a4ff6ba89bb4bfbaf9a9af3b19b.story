'Fraudster': Jean-Claude Baumgartner, pictured on the slopes with his girlfriend Gemma, claimed he could not be in court because his 'bank cards didn't work'

A Dragons' Den 'conman' allegedly blew £230,000 on living a life of luxury instead of his satnav for skiers product that wowed the show's judges.

Jean-Claude Baumgartner, 50, is charged with duping Peter Jones and Theo Paphitis into handing over the money as an investment - then spending it on himself.

The Swiss-born businessman, who is understood to be in Germany, was due to appear at Blackfriars Crown Court on Monday but claimed he was snowed in.

The hearing was adjourned until today 
but he contacted his solicitors overnight to say his bank cards were not
working and could not purchase a flight from Cologne.

Prosecutor Mark James-Dawson said: 'Your Honour will see that he is not here.

'A
text message was sent this morning saying he had texted his solicitors 
at half past two and four o'clock, saying his bank cards had failed so 
he could not travel.

'My application will be for a warrant not backed for bail.

'He wasn't here on Monday. He said his flight had been cancelled.'

The lawyer said Baumgartner, who is on unconditional bail, has family in Germany and Switzerland.

Describing
the alleged fraud, he added: 'There is a serious amount of 
professionally planned dishonesty from the start and throughout, with 
the investors' money.'

Judge Aidan Marron QC issued a warrant
for his arrest and the lawyer added: 'The wheels have been put in 
motion for a European Arrest Warrant already.'

Baumgartner
allegedly lied to Jones and Paphitis when he said his company Satsports
owned the software rights for the device, which retails at £329.

'Tricked': Dragons' Den stars Theo Paphitis and Peter Jones who handed £230,000 over as an investment

Baumgartner first appeared on a Sports Relief special of the popular BBC2 show in March 2010 when his confident presentation for the aptly named 'Satski' immediately sparked a bidding war between the panel of tycoons.

Spoilt for offers, he eventually accepted a joint deal from Dragons Jones and Paphitis to receive a £130,000 investment for 49 per cent of his company

He is accused of faking a string of documents to secure another £100,000 from Jones and Paphitis and lying about his on-going success until his arrest in April 2010.

Rebecca Trowler, defending, said the GPS device had not always been doomed.

'The GPS device has already won prizes at the Gadget Show, before Mr Baumgartner had anything to do with Dragons' Den,' said the lawyer.

'It was a business well on its way before he had anything to do with the Dragons.

'He was invited onto Dragons' Den by the BBC.'

Dragons' Den features inventors pitching their ideas to a team of businessmen - the Dragons - who then decide whether to back the projects with their own money.

Baumgartner, from, Hampstead, north London, denies two counts of fraud.
