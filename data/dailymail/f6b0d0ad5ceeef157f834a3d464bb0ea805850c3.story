A mother-of-two decided to drastically change her life and lost 10 stone - almost half her body-weight - following a family holiday on which she was left humiliated when the aeroplane seat-belt would not fit around her size 30 waist.

Marcia Rushton, 38, had to call over flight attendant and ask for a seat belt extension to wrap around her 21st frame before the plane could take off.

Marcia, who lives in Amthorpe, Doncaster, with her husband Wayne and their two children, said: 'I didn't know what to do when
my seat belt wouldn't fasten. I thought I would have to get off the 
plane and that would be the end of my holiday. I didn't know extensions 
existed until someone told me.'

Marcia Rushton, 38, pictured before her diet, was so humiliated when the seat-belt wouldn't fit around her waist on holiday that she decided to lose weight, and lost almost half her body-weight in just 18 months

She added: 'I remember having to ask for a seat belt extension because I couldn't fasten the belt. I was really embarrassed.

But determined Marcia vowed it would 
never happen again, so when she returned from holiday she joined a slimming club with her sisters Michelle Johnson, 40, of Bessacarr, Doncaster, and Carla Murgatroyd, 35, of Armthorpe.

The trio stopped eating sugary snacks and convenience foods and instead focused on making proper, healthy meals. And Marcia has now, over 18 months, shed an amazing 10 stone - almost half her body weight. Between them the sisters have lost a total of 17 stone.

The women have also begun hosting regular Come Dine With Me-themed slimming evenings featuring their 
own recipes, and their special foodie events have even lead to Marcia being named Woman of the Year 
by her local slimming club.

'Now I have slimmed down I can't believe how big my old clothes are. I have an old pair of jeans and I can actually fit into one of the legs'

Marcia, who now weighs 11st 2lbs and can fit into a size 12 dress said: 'I have always enjoyed food and ate a lot of convenience meals. My weight crept up over the years and I knew something had to be done.Â 

'But when that happened on the plane it gave me the incentive to do something about it.

'Now
I have slimmed down I can't believe how big my old clothes are. I have 
an old pair of jeans and I can actually fit into one of the legs.'
