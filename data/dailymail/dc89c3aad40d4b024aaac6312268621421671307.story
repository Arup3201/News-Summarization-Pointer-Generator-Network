Thanks to burlesque star Dita Von Teese, having a retro cone-shaped embonpoint has never been so cool. But for those with a less than perky pair, achieving a 1940s shape has been a tough task - until now.

Hot on the heels of their silhouette-shaping 'drop a dress size' dress, Marks and Spencer has launched the sexy 'Perky Profile' bra to help shoppers get Dita's look for less.

It aims to give breasts a retro cone shape thanks to specially constructed padding.

Perky: The new bra will give you a retro pushed out - as opposed to pushed up - embonpoint

Inspiration: Glamorous burlesque star, Dita Von Teese, is a big fan of autumn's hottest trend - 1940s style

The bra, which is available in Dita esque black and pink, as well as a ladylike cream, will, say M&S, give you a 'push out' rather than a push up profile.

Soozie Jenkinson, Head of Lingerie Design at M&S says: 'Modern day celebrities like Dita Von Teese have championed this glamorous retro forties style.

'The perfect underpinnings are essential in achieving this look, which is why we launched our Perky Profile bra which projects the bust giving you a fuller, more pronounced shape for the ultimate Sweater Girl look.

'This lingerie innovation uses a completely new cup shape creating a higher bust point giving a more stand out shape.'

Paschal Little, head of lingerie innovation at M&S added: 'The unique and innovative smoothing cups have been engineered with extra projection at the bust point providing a modern silhouette which emulates glamour icons from the 1940's Hollywood era.

'This gives a great new shape under this season's "New Look" silhouette.'

Although the perky profile bra and drop a dress size dress have been grabbing most of the headlines, they aren't the only body enhancing pieces to have arrived at M&S in recent months. 

Innovative: Marks & Spencer's new 'Light as Air' bra and 'Drop A Dress Size' fitted dress

Other new additions to the brand's output include the 'no gap shirt' which has a hidden placket and an extra button to ensure that you never flash your bra again.

Also proving popular is the new Light as Air bra, which weighs just 39 grams - a whopping 11 grams less than the average bra.

With no padding and made using new moulding techniques, the bra gives a smooth shape without adding weight.

'The ultra light weight and breathable materials used in our Light as Air bra [were] developed to keep you cool and comfortable in the warmer months,' added Little.

'We have incorporated an airy, open work channel below the cup to increase the feeling of coolness, comfort and airflow through the garment.

'This modern concept bra is neither padded nor non padded, but is moulded to give you a feminine shape with definition.'
