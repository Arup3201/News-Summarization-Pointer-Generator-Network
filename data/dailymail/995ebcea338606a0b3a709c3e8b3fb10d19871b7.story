First Lady Michelle Obama will hit the campaign trail again next month, this time for Iowa Senate candidate Bruce Braley.

The Des Moines Register confirmed Obama's plans with both the White House and the Braley campaign on Wednesday.

Braley currently represents Iowa in the House of Representatives and is competing against Iowa state senator Joni Ernst for the open U.S. Senate seat in November's general election.

The Democratic Rep. is currently leading his opponent by a razor-thin margin, and an endorsement from the first lady could give him the bump he needs to claim victory in November's election. 

Unlike her husband, whose approval ratings have reached new lows this summer, Michelle Obama continues to be well-liked by most Americans, making her an asset to Democrats chasing seats in the Senate.

'The first lady is not only popular with Democrats, but with independents and Republicans as well,' Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Executive Director Guy Cecil told The Hill. 

'She has been incredibly supportive of our campaigns and our work to hold the majority.'

The first lady may be supportive of Democrats effort to retain the majority in the Senate, but she has been hesitant to lend her time to candidates.

Democrats have complained in recent weeks that Michelle Obama, who had a 61 percent approval rating as of May, hasn't done as much as she could for the party ahead of November's mid-term elections.

'I don’t want to say she’s been M.I.A. but she’s been M.I.A.,' a Democrat in a tough race told The Hill in August. 

While Obama has appeared at numerous fundraisers for the the national Democratic Party she's been mostly unwilling to make appearances on behalf of individual Senate candidates, even as she has encouraged other members of the party 'to be even more passionate and more hungry' about getting Democrats elected to office than they were in 2010 and 2012.

Her only notable appearance on the campaign trail this fall came earlier this week when Obama headlined and fundraiser and rally on Monday in Atlanta, Georgia for Senate nominee Michelle Nunn.

Nunn is the CEO of a non-profit organization called Points of Light. The daughter of former Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, politics runs in her blood and she's currently seeking the state's open seat along with Republican nominee David Perdue. 

Perdue is a businessman who has served as the CEO or Rebook and Dollar General. Adding to the tangle of family ties in the race is that he's the cousin of Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue. 

Polling website Real Clear Politics has Perdue leading Nunn in the race by under two points.

Michelle Obama came to Nunn's aid on Monday, stumping for her and other Georgia Democrats at a voter registration drive.

'The stakes this year couldn't be higher,' Obama told the throng of people who showed up at the event hoping to meet her.

'If we don't show up in the polls this November, if we don't elect leaders in Congress and here in Georgia who put people first instead of fighting for special interests, we know exactly what will happen,' she said, according to CNN.

'We will see more folks interfering in women's private decisions about our health care. We'll see more folks denying that climate change even exists. We'll see more votes against equal pay and immigration reform and raising" the minimum wage.'

It's unclear when Obama will travel to Iowa other than sometime next month nor is it clear what sort of events she'll attend while she's there.

It's likely she'll couple the campaign appearances for Braley with official White House business, as she did in Georgia on Monday when she visited the Booker T. Washington High School to promote her Reach Higher initiative, a program that pushes students to pursue careers in higher education.
