Not for the first time Roy Keane has crossed a line that leaves him in extremely dangerous territory.

If he offended the fair-minded majority in his first autobiography with the admission that it was his intention to severely injure Alf-Inge Haaland in 2001, his reflections in his latest book, The Second Half, will spark yet more controversy.

On Clive Clarke’s heart attack

He admits to an ‘evil thought’ about the former Sunderland player, whose career was cut short by a heart attack when he was on loan at Leicester in 2007. He admits to using news of Clarke’s sudden illness to deflect the attention away from the 3-0 defeat his Sunderland side had just suffered against Luton. ‘I said that football results didn’t really matter,’ he writes. ‘And I had the evil thought, “I’m glad he had it tonight,” because it would deflect from our woeful performance.’

He also concedes that, having once joked that he was surprised ‘they’d found a heart’, he ‘sometimes forgot’ he ‘wasn’t the only person with parents and children’.

The darkness of Keane’s thoughts are no less shocking however well we already thought we knew the volatile former Manchester United captain. Talented and intelligent Keane undoubtedly is. But this second book, skilfully ghosted by Roddy Doyle, offers the kind of insight that will disturb as much as it fascinates.

Some might say he is simply being honest, but here is yet another example of nobody being there to save Keane from himself. The Haaland passage was apparently missed by his advisers all those years ago and here, now, is the result of Keane handling all aspects of the latest book himself. This follows his split from Michael Kennedy, a lawyer he once said he trusted with his life.

Revisiting that Alf-Inge Haaland tackle

The Haaland episode was every bit as shocking; not least because of Keane’s warped sense of justice. He said he was still angry with Haaland for accusing him of play-acting when he was writhing in agony - with what was actually a cruciate injury - after kicking out at the then Leeds midfielder in 1997.

So four years later, with Haaland playing for Manchester City, Keane plants his studs on Haaland’s knee.

‘I’d waited long enough,’ wrote Keane in that first book. ‘I f****** hit him hard. The ball was there (I think). Take that you c***. And don’t ever stand over me sneering about fake injuries.’

The FA responded by banning Keane for five matches and fining him £150,000. In the latest book he insists he is not the least bit sorry.

‘There are things I regret in my life and he’s not one of them,’ writes Keane, and how depressing an attitude that is.

He might have the ability to inspire, and we might sometimes admire him for his fearlessness. For instance, Keane was still the United captain when he used a newspaper column to suggest his employers had treated Jaap Stam like a ‘piece of meat’ when the defender was sold to Lazio.

But it is the thought processes that are as alarming as they are intriguing. Take this one, for instance, on the club car he returned when he left Old Trafford. ‘I’d given back the (club) car,’ he writes. ‘I drove some f****** miles in that car. Every little victory is vital.’

Anyone who has had an acrimonious split with an employer will relate to that. They will probably find it funny, too. But coming from Keane it just offers us further evidence of how angry and aggressive an individual he can be.

He offers strong opinions on anyone of note he has encountered. 

The Class of 2014

Now here is a group who don’t impress Keane. ‘I wonder about the current United dressing room,’ he writes. ‘I look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better.

‘Not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best. Looking at what happened to David Moyes, I can only conclude that he didn’t have a strong dressing room. He had a weak dressing room.’ Ouch.

The current crop of Manchester United players 'should be doing a lot better' than they are in Keane's opinion

Peter Schmeichel scrap

The Danish goalkeeper was significantly bigger than Keane but that did not stop the Irishman leaving his colleague with a black eye after headbutting him during a drink-fuelled clash on tour.

‘Peter had grabbed me, I’d headbutted him - we’d been fighting for ages,’ Keane reveals, nevertheless saying that he ‘admired’ the goalkeeper. He explains: ‘I had a bust-up with Peter when we were on a pre-season tour of Asia. There was drink involved. The manager had a go at us as we were getting on the bus, and people were going on about a fight in the hotel the night before. It started coming back to me - the fight between me and Peter.’

Patrick Vieira tunnel clash 

He admires the former Arsenal captain too, and admits the towering Frenchman ‘would have killed me in a fight’ when they clashed in that infamous tunnel incident at Highbury in 2005.

Angered by the sight of Vieira apparently ‘trying to bully’ Gary Neville, Keane exploded with rage. ‘I just thought: “The f******”. They were trying to bully him. They were a big team and, in the tunnel, they were even bigger. So I said to myself “Alright, let’s go”.’

Rio Ferdinand’s missed drugs test

As a player Keane rated Ferdinand. But he was less impressed with the then United centre half when he received an eight-month ban and a £50,000 fine for missing a drug test at the club’s training ground in 2003. ‘He suffered for it and so did the team,’ recalls Keane on Ferdinand. ‘If it had been me, and the doctor had said I had to do a drugs test, I’d have gone and done it. It wasn’t something I’d have forgotten.

‘It wouldn’t have been like collecting a letter at the office, or remembering your boots. When a doctor says you’ve got to do a drugs test, it’s not an everyday thing.’

Keane also says he cried in the car when he drove away from United one last time. But he has kind words for some too:

Cristiano Ronaldo the grafter

He recalls with some amusement how United’s first encounter with a then 17-year-old Ronaldo in a friendly against Sporting Lisbon left John O’Shea needing medical attention for ‘dizzy spells’.

‘We always joked with Sheasy he had actually sealed the deal by playing like a f****** clown,’ writes Keane of Ronaldo, who was signed after the game.

But he admired Ronaldo enormously. ‘I liked Ronaldo straight away,’ he writes. ‘He was 17 but he was immediately one of the hardest working players at United. He was good looking and he knew it. Looking at some of the other players in front of the mirror I would think: “You f****** nugget”. But Ronaldo had an innocence to him.’

TV’s such an easy gig

Keane once said he did not have the phone numbers of his United team-mates. He also said he was not comfortable having visitors at his house, that view having been expressed after a surprise visit from then Republic of Ireland manager Mick McCarthy.

But Keane says he enjoyed the company of Lee Dixon and Adrian Chiles when he was working for television. Not that he considers such work terribly challenging.

‘It’s an easy gig,’ he writes. ‘I don’t like easy gigs. When I heard: “I liked your commentary last night”, I knew I was only talking bull**** like the rest of them. Hopefully my bull**** was a bit better.’

His latest offering will certainly have an impact.
