A 15-year-old boy has been arrested 133 times, making him one of Britain's most prolific criminals.

The teenage crime-wave committed all the offences close to his home on the Wirral, near Liverpool, and has so far been convicted a total of 28 times.

It is not known what the boy's crimes were.

Just three other hardened criminals in the Merseyside area have committed more offences, including a 40 year old man who has been arrested 176 times and convicted of 65 offences.

The arrest figures were unveiled after a request under the Freedom of Information Act.

Southport Liberal Democrat John Pugh says more action is needed to stem the tide of re-offending.

He said: 'These people are neither learning nor caring but are costing society dearly.

'We can’t go on pretending that normal law enforcement works with these characters.'

Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention, added: 'Prison is the only sure way to protect the public from hardened criminals.'

The figures obtained by the Daily Express also revealed that a thief who has been in court an average of three times a year since 1959 was jailed for clocking up his 334th crime in November.

Robert Knowles, 66, has broken the law so many times that prosecutors have lost track of his records.

Jordan Kemp Withey, who at 13 was slapped with a two-year antisocial behaviour order. Right, Harry Hankinson, 64, blames his 501 crimes on a blow to the head in 1970 which changed his personality

Homeless Knowles was sent to a 
correctional school at the age of 13 and has been stealing ever since - 
appearing in court 186 times, including in every single year since 1959.

The
 alcoholic is 'institutionalised' and steals to be sent back to jail, a 
court heard when he was jailed for two months in November.

Meanwhile, Bolton kleptomaniac Harry Hankinson, 64, blames his 501 crimes on a blow to the head in 1970 which changed his personality.

In September 2012 troublemaker Jordan Kemp Withey, then 13, was slapped with a two-year antisocial behaviour order that covers the whole of the Humberside Police area.

Withey’s crimes started on Havenfield estate in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, but soon spread elsewhere.

His reign of terror has included criminal damage, theft, trespassing and causing harassment, alarm and distress and began when he was just nine.
