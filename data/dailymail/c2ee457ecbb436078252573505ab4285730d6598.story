Barack Obama tonight urged Scottish voters not to break apart ‘one of the closest allies we’ll ever have’ by voting for independence on Thursday.

The dramatic intervention, just three days before Scotland goes to the polls, will infuriate Alex Salmond - with the battle for independence set to be decided by the smallest of margins.

Up to half a million voters remain undecided - with concerns over the future of Scotland’s place in major international organisations like the EU, Nato and the UN still hotly debated.

Barack Obama does not want Scotland to break up the United Kingdom because the US has a 'deep interest' in keeping it together, his spokesman said today

White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Mr Obama wanted Britain to remain 'strong, robust, united and an effective partner of the United States'

Mr Obama’s spokesman Josh Earnest said: ‘From the outside, the United States has a deep interest in ensuring that one of the closest allies we'll ever have remains strong, robust, united and an effective partner of the United States.’

The remarks came after Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen confirmed Scotland would have to reapply to join the military alliance - and stressed that to do every members would have to agree.

He said: ‘In case that Scotland voted in favour of independence then Scotland would have to apply for membership of Nato as a new independent state. A decision on accession would have to be taken by unanimity, by consensus as always in Nato.’

The double salvo against independence comes amid warning that the US would vigorously oppose the Alex Salmond’s plan to move Britain’s Trident nuclear submarines from the Clyde after independence.

Britain’s nuclear capability is key strand of Nato’s military defence and any threat would spark fury in Washington.

Earlier this year Mr Obama used the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings to praise the United Kingdom and warn against Scottish separatism.

Speaking alongside David Cameron, Mr Obama said: 'I would say that the United Kingdom has been an extraordinary partner to us.

‘From the outside at least, it looks like things have worked pretty well.'

The British people will make the ‘right decision’ in an in-out referendum, he said.

‘We obviously have a deep interest in making sure one of the closest allies we will ever remains a strong, robust, united and effective partner.’

President Barack Obama's intervention will have delighted the Prime Minister, who is battling to save the union

Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond - at Edinburgh Airport  in Edinburgh today - has previously made light of US criticism of Scottish independence

Mr Obama added: ‘Whenever our two nations stand together, it can leave a world that is more secure and more prosperous and more just.

‘On that day, like so many others, American and British troops stood together and fought valiantly alongside our allies.

‘They didn't just help to win the war, they helped to turn the tide of human history and are the reason that we can stand here today in a free Europe and with the freedoms that our nations enjoy

‘Theirs is the legacy that our two nations and our great alliance continue to uphold and I'm grateful to have a fine partner in David in making that happen.’

Mr Salmond attempted to make light of the remarks at the time. Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland, Mr Salmond said: ‘America had to fight for its independence. We are very fortunate in Scotland that we have a democratic, agreed, consented process by which we can vote for our independence.

‘So, in summary, I suppose my message to President Obama is “yes we can”.’

Mr Obama is not the first world leader to have spoken out against independence.

Australian prime minister Tony Abbott last month said: 'As a friend of Britain, as an observer from afar, it’s hard to see how the world would be helped by an independent Scotland.'

Genealogists believe they can trace Mr Obama’s ancestry to William the Lion, who ruled Scotland from 1165 to 1214.

A maternal ancestor of Mr Obama, Edward FitzRandolph, is said to have emigrated from Scotland to America in the 17th century.

The First Minister has never met Mr Obama but did invite him attend the 2009 Homecoming Festival, although he did not get a reply.

The President led international condemnation in 2009 of the decision by Mr Salmond’s administration in Edinburgh to free the Lockerbie bomber and allow him to return to Libya to a hero’s welcome.
