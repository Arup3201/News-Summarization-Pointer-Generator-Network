The captain of the Bloomfield High School football team has been charged with the murder of a 27-year-old man with whom he had allegedly been having a sexual relationship.

Tarence Mitchell, 18, of Bloomfield, is accused of stabbing Ronald Taylor Jr five times in the torso and leaving the knife in his back after trying to break off the two-year relationship.

The incident took place Thursday night in the front yard of Mitchell's home at 24 Hill Farm Road on Thursday night.

According to court documents, the murder weapon was a steak knife.

Tarence Mitchell, a star Connecticut high school football player, was trying to break it off with his older lover when he stabbed the man to death during a tussle outside the teen's home, cops say

Tarence Mitchell was arrested Thursday and, according to police, has confessed to stabbing his lover, Ronal Taylor Jr

NBC Connecticut reports that Mitchell armed himself after Taylor arranged a meeting between the two, promising it 'wasn't going to end well'.

Police responded to a call at 9:13 p.m. after receiving reports of two men fighting and found two people suffering from stab wounds.

An ambulance transported Ronald Taylor Jr., 27, of Bloomfield, to Saint Francis Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

According to court documents, Mitchell first lied to police about the stabbing, claiming both he and Taylor were attacked by two men.

He changed his story during an interview with police and admitted to stabbing Taylor five times, according to court documents.

Mitchell is being held in jail on a $1 million bond.The youngster doesn't suffer from any mental illness, the court heard, but 'he's extremely confused and upset' about Taylor's murder.

According to the documents, Mitchell - a star football player described as a 'great kid' - told officers that he and Taylor were in a sexual relationship but that he had tried to distance himself from Taylor.

He said that three weeks ago, Taylor had posted a photo of Mitchell on Facebook, calling him 'Bloomfield gay football player'.

Mitchell told police that Taylor took it down but threatened to post the photo again if Mitchell tried to distance himself again.

On his Facebook page, Mitchell is listed as 'interested in women'.

Mitchell told officers that Taylor had threatened him with a sword in the past and would get jealous when he texted girls, according to court documents.

Taylor texted Mitchell on Thursday saying he was coming over and that it 'wasn't going to end well', Mitchell told investigators.

Mitchell told police that he armed himself with a knife and stabbed Taylor after Taylor punched him in the face.

Police claim Taylor tried to run away, but Mitchell chased him and stabbed him again, including once in the back.

Police set bond initially at $500,000.

Mitchell has no arrest history, and his lawyer asked for a lower amount, but the judge set bond at $1 million. 

He appeared in court Friday, and his lawyer said he is 'extremely confused and upset' by the death of Taylor.

Mitchell's mother, Tyra Smith, defended her son, saying 'he's never been in trouble'.
