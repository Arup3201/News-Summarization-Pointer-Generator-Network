Grammy Award-winning engineer and producer Phil Ramone who worked with Ray Charles, Billy Joel and Paul Simon, has died at 72. 

His son Matt confirmed the death and said his father was 'very loving and will be missed.'

Ramone, who lived in Wilton, 
Connecticut, had elective surgery on February 27 to prevent an aortic 
aneurysm. He later developed pneumonia and died 
Saturday morning at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital.

Few producers had a more spectacular and diverse career.

With 14 Grammy Awards, he worked with Frank Sinatra and Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney, Elton John and Tony Bennett.

Long term colleague and friend Billy Joel said: 'I always thought of Phil Ramone as the most talented guy in my band. He was the guy that no one ever ever saw onstage.

'He was with me as long as any of the musicians I ever played with – longer than most. So much of my music was shaped by him and brought to fruition by him.

I have lost a dear friend – and my greatest mentor. The music world lost a giant today.'

Ramone joined Joel for what became one of his biggest successes, 'The Stranger,' released in 1977.

As Joel 
explained at the time, Ramone fit right in with the musicians and 
encouraged everyone to relax.

'We did songs in five takes instead 
of 15 or 20,' Joel said. 'He was one of the guys. We'd throw around 
ideas, kick the songs around, try them different ways and get them 
right. Sometimes we'd throw pizza at each other.'

Ramone produced three records that went on to win Grammys for album of the year with Paul Simon's 'Still Crazy After All These Years," Joel's '52nd Street' and ray Charles' 'Genius Loves Company.'

He was a pioneer of digital recording who produced what is regarded as the first major commercial release on compact disc, '52nd Street,' which came out on CD in 1982.

He thrived producing music for 
television, film and the stage. He won an Emmy for a TV special about 
Duke Ellington, a Grammy for the soundtrack to the Broadway musical 
'Promises, Promises' and a Grammy for the soundtrack to 'Flashdance.'

Ramone
 made an art out of the 'Duets' concept, pairing Sinatra with Bono, 
Luther Vandross and other younger artists, Bennett with McCartney and 
Barbra Streisand, and Charles with Bonnie Raitt and Van Morrison. In 
Ramone's memoir, 'Making Records,' he recalled persuading a hesitant 
Sinatra to re-record some of his signature songs.

Billy Joel: his 1977 breakthrough album 'The Stranger' and six later albums, including 'Just the Way You Are'

Quincy Jones: on the 1969 album 'Smackwater Jack'

Paul Simon: the 1975 album 'Still Crazy After All These Years'

Frank Sinatra: the 1993 album 'Duets'

Barbra Streisand: the 1967 live album 'A Happening in Central Park,' and the 1976 song 'Evergreen' (Love Theme from 'A Star Is Born')

He was also responsible for recording 
Marilyn Monroe's now infamous performance of Happy Birthday Mr President
 to John F. Kennedy in 1962.

Ramone told Sound on Sound magazine 
in 2005: 'I served a long time as an engineer and watched many famous 
producers work, and I decided on the personality that came most easily 
to me, which is the more relaxed; to give artists encouragement when 
needed.

'Players are like prodigies, thoroughbreds," he added. "You have to handle them with care.'

Ramone wrote: 'I reminded Frank that while Laurence Olivier had performed Shakespeare in his 20s, the readings he did when he was in his 60s gave them new meaning,'I spoke with conviction. "Don't my children - and your grandchildren - deserve to hear the way you're interpreting your classic songs now?"'

A native of South Africa, he seemed born to make music. He had learned violin by age 3 and was trained at The Julliard School in New York. Before age 20, he had opened his own recording studio.

At the age of 10 he performed violin in front of Queen Elizabeth II.

The father-of-three is survived by wife Karen and sons Matt, BJ and Simon.

Ramone's many industry honors were returned in kind. He was chairman emeritus of the board of trustees of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS). He was an advocate for music education and a trustee for the National Recording Preservation Board of the Library of Congress.

His recent recordings included albums with Bennett, Simon, George Michael and Dionne Warwick.

'I still make records on the basis that three or four players and a singer, and the song, come together right there," he said recently for an interview on CBS.com. 'It's a really strong way to work. I'm ready to work, musicians are ready to play. There's a feeling.'
