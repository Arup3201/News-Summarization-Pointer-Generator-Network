Nintendo launched its eagerly anticipated Wii U in the UK last night - the first major home console launch since 2006.

Hundreds of fans queued in central London ahead of the official launch at midnight.

The release of the console is seen by industry experts as something as a last chance for Nintendo to stay at the forefront of gaming.

It posted its first-ever loss last year and is slipping behind as handheld gaming improves.

The original Wii changed the way many viewed home gaming when it was released six years.

But after the rapid developments made in smartphone and tablet technology the Japanese company hopes its latest offering will do the same again.

On Thursday night, close to 300 fans queued outside HMV's Oxford Street store, which hosted the official midnight launch following the US release earlier this month, a spokesman for Nintendo said.

HMV ensured it was well-stocked for the launch following high demand for pre-orders. In the US, all 400,000 units sold out in a week.

The Wii U features the GamePad controller, a tablet-type device that allows users to continue playing after the connected television has been turned off or switched to another channel.

The controller boasts a 6.2in touchscreen display and a three to five-hour battery life.

Among the games expected to be best-sellers are ZombiU, which carries an 18 age restriction, Nintendo Land - the Wii Sports for the new console - and New Super Mario Bros U.

The console has received mixed reviews in the US, with most concerns surrounding the amount of games that will be available to justify the minimum £250 cost.

Others have mentioned the controller’s weak battery performance, a lack of stand-out launch games and frustrating menus and online services.

Four men had camped outside the store since Saturday to ensure they would be the first to lay their hands on the console. But the majority of the crowd joined the queue on Thursday evening, entertained by a DJ set and gaming experts.

The original console revolutionised gaming with its infra-red motion-capture controllers that allowed users to play games such as golf and tennis by actually mimicking the actions.

But industry experts have already questioned the new console. 'The machine is actually quite hard to understand - or perhaps to see the point of,' Oli Walsh, the deputy editor of eurogamer, told the Guardian.

Nintendo UK marketing director Shelly Pearce said: 'We can’t wait to get the Wii U into the hands of our fans in the UK.' But she did admit it was a 'complicated device to explain in words'.
