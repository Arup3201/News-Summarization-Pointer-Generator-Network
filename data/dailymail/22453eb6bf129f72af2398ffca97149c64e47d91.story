Inspiration: Lady Carnarvon in her nurse's uniform at her own makeshift hospital during the Great War

The socialite who was the inspiration for Downton Abbey’s Lady Cora refused an honour recognising her work caring for the wounded during the First World War.

Almina, the 5th Countess of Carnarvon, who trained as a nurse and turned Highclere Castle into a military hospital, apparently did not think she merited the CBE offered in the 1920 Honours List.

Her decision is recorded in Cabinet Office papers obtained by The Mail on Sunday.

They reveal she was one of several female aristocrats who declined to be honoured.

Almina, who was known as the ‘pocket-sized Venus’, transformed herself from a flamboyant socialite into a tireless campaigner after the outbreak of war in 1914.

She dug deep into her own fortune and equipped Highclere – where Downton is filmed – with an operating theatre in one of the bedrooms and a recovery room next door.

Officers who were treated there recalled being served beer by footmen and described it as ‘paradise’.

On one occasion the Countess, who tended the men personally, had to fire ‘a pretty auburn-haired nurse’ after discovering her ‘in flagrante delicto’ with a patient – future Brigadier-General Sir George Paynter.

These experiences – including the sex scandal – shaped the second series of Downton, which was screened in 2011.

It showed the Crawley family transforming their house into a rest home for injured officers.

The current Lady Carnarvon, who is 
Almina’s biographer, said last night she was unaware of the 
recommendation but was not surprised it had been declined.

She said: ‘Almina was not the sort of person who would have wanted a fuss. She was one of a generation of women who just got on with it.’

The Cabinet Office papers show that the women were among about 760 people who turned down honours between 1918 and 1920.

The files do not explain their reluctance but it is possible they considered such awards unpalatable after seeing the horrors of the Great War.

Millicent, Duchess of Sutherland, was a celebrated beauty who ran an ambulance unit and several field hospitals close to the front line. She turned down a CBE in 1919.

Transformation: Highclere Castle, where Lady Almina lived and where Downton Abbey is filmed, became a military hospital during the First World War, which Lady Almina funded with her own money and worked at as a nurse

Lady Stirling Maxwell, who turned her Scottish home, Pollok House, into a hospital, and one of her  London residences into a home for blinded soldiers, rejected an unspecified honour in 1920.

Her grandson, Sir John Maxwell Macdonald, last night recalled  family talk of her declining an OBE. He said: ‘She already had a title and didn’t want any more. The Maxwell family tended to be against decorations as a whole.

‘My grandmother was keen to play her part and she wouldn’t have given any thought to honours. That would have been out of the question. She wasn’t that sort of person.’

Julian Fellowes, creator of Downton Abbey, said: ‘I am certain many of these women were genuinely modest about their achievements and did not desire to be what we would call celebrities.

‘It was enough for them to know that their work had been valued by the officers and men.’

He added: ‘For us as a generation, unfaked modesty and finding satisfaction in the work itself – rather than in public adulation – are very difficult to believe in. But for these women, to be recognised in the street would have been torture.’
