It's most women's dream (and every hair dye company's worst nightmare) - a pensioner from Coventry celebrated her 104th birthday last week and revealed she still hasn't gone grey.

Freda Taylor, from Coventry, still has a full head of naturally brown hair, despite having received four cards from the Queen to mark her ripe old age.

But instead of any fancy beauty creams or hair treatments, Freda puts her fantastic flowing locks down to clean living.

Freda Taylor, 104, from Coventry, still has a full head of naturally brown hair. The grandmother hasn't gone grey, despite living through two world wars. Her secret to a youthful look is clean living

Freda said: 'I definitely put my healthy hair down to staying healthy all through my life - no cigarettes or big nights in the pub for me.'

The grandmother, who now lives at Fairfield Care Home, was born in 1901 into a family of eight brothers and sisters.

She married her husband Gordon just before the Second World War broke out and the couple had one son, Keith.

Freda spent the war years working for Hinkley Building Society collecting and delivering money between businesses around Bedworth on her bike while her husband was part of the war effort in the Middle East.

And despite her many years, Freda's brown hair isn't the only thing perfectly intact - her memory is equally sharp. 

She said: 'One of my earliest memories happened over 100 years ago on July 28, 1914 in Blackpool - I remember overhearing my father telling someone on the beach that he'd just heard on the radio that we were at war.

'One of the main memories I have of the Second World War was on November 14, 1940 - the night Coventry suffered its biggest bombing raid.

'I had four-year-old Keith with me and my dad drove us in his car from the outskirts of Coventry to relative safety in Bulkington.

'It was a wicked journey and a night I will never forget. The bangs were horrible and made us all jump.'

Freda has lived through two World Wars, which would give plenty of reason for a head of grey hairs, but she claims her secret to a youthful appearance is actually very simple

Freda has lived through two World Wars, which would give plenty of reason for a head of grey hairs, but she claims her secret to a youthful appearance is actually very simple. 

She said: 'I remember my brothers and I being under strict orders from dad not to smoke, and because I looked up to him so much, it was something I never did.

'I've never been much of a drinker either, so my advice to people would be to follow my dad's advice and look after yourselves.'
