The driver of this unique £1 million supercar might just have some explaining to do - after crashing it while taking it for a spin without its owner.

The driver of the Pagani Zonda GJ lost control of the 214 mph car while driving around in an industrial estate in London.

He crashed the one-off car into metal fencing, seriously damaging the car's bodywork.

The driver of this unique £1 million supercar might just have some explaining to do - after crashing it while taking it for a spin without its owner

The supercar was spotted being driven earlier in the day with trade plates, and it is not thought the owner of the car was driving at the time of the crash

The Zonda is powered by a 7.3-litre V12 engine which develops a whopping 594bhp. This gives it a 0-62mph time of just 3.5 seconds and a top speed of 214mph

The supercar was spotted being driven earlier in the day with trade plates, and it is not thought the owner of the car was driving at the time of the crash.

A spokesperson for the Met Police said no one was hurt in the incident, which took place in Park Royal at lunchtime on Wednesday.

And it is not the first time this Zonda has been involved in a serious accident.

It was bought new for around £340,000 in 2003 by Scottish oil tycoon Gareth Jones but is now thought to be worth in the region of £1million.

But in 2009 he let a 'world famous racing driver' take the lively Pagani for a drive in Aberdeenshire, with the champion crashing it into an electricity pole.

And it is not the first time this Zonda has been involved in a serious accident. Its previous owner was horrified when his £1 million Pagani Zonda S car was slammed into a telegraph pole after handing the keys over to a professional racing driver

F1 legend Jackie Stewart was forced to deny local rumours he was behind the wheel of the car at the time, with the identity of the driver never officially revealed.

After the crash - the most expensive in Aviva's history - the Zonda was sent back to Pagani's headquarters in Italy where it was given a complete overhaul at a cost of £261,000.

The car is now believed to be owned by a businessman from the Far East.
