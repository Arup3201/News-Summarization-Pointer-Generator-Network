Under fire: David Cameron has offered to knight four former ministers he sacked this week

David Cameron was accused last night of bringing the honours system into disrepute after rewarding ministers sacked in his reshuffle.

No 10 slipped out a statement on Wednesday night revealing that the Prime Minister was recommending four male former ministers for knighthoods.

It also emerged that the two women axed from the Cabinet are likely to get peerages.

The knighthoods will go to three Tories – James Paice, Edward Garnier and Gerald Howarth – and one Liberal Democrat, Nick Harvey, even though they have served for only two years.

Both the decision and timing of the announcement have been criticised.

Sir Alistair Graham, former head of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, said: ‘Why have these been announced separate from the normal twice yearly lists?

‘It is fatal to the dignity and credibility of any honours system if they are seen to be automatic.’

Labour MP Paul Flynn said: ‘The distribution of consolation prizes to sacked ministers is likely to bring the honours system into further disrepute and ridicule.’

Graham Smith, of Republic, which campaigns for reform of the process, said it appeared to be ‘rewards for failure’, adding: ‘It is a straightforward abuse of the system.’

Lib Dem MP Greg Mulholland said it was ‘quite disgraceful’ for dumped ministers to be offered ‘a sweetener of an honour’.

There was anger among female MPs that
sacked male ministers had been given gongs while there was nothing for 
Cheryl Gillan and Caroline Spelman.

Sources said they were furious at their ‘cold and calculating’ treatment.

But No 10 insiders indicated both were likely to get peerages after the next election.

Last week, the Commons Public Administration select committee called for political involvement in the honours system to end.

Mr Cameron steeled his nerves with a 
glass of wine before sacking ministers, sources said. But they denied he
reduced ministers to tears or sacked Mrs Spelman because she was too 
old at 54.

The Premier also rejected claims he made anyone cry, telling ITV’s Daybreak: ‘That is not true.’
