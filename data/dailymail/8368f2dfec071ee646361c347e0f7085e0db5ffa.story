It may look like a blast from the past, but this 1980s model Volvo is in pristine condition and good as new.

The 27-year-old Volvo 340 is being sold with just 132 miles on the clock after spending nearly three decades in a garage.

The car was bought brand new by an elderly gentleman in 1987.

For sale: This 1987 Volvo 340 is up for sale in King's Lynn after its elderly owner passed away

Low mileage: The 27-year-old car has just 132 miles on the clock, compared with the 150,000 on Volvos of a similar age

Prang: The elderly owner bought the Volvo brand new in 1987, but weeks later he pranged the car, knocking a dent into the bodywork as well as knocking his confidence

But just a few weeks after purchasing the car, the man pranged his new wheels. After less than 100 miles he grazed the side wing when he hit a bollard at a garden centre.

The incident not only knocked the car, it knocked his confidence prompting him to drive the Volvo into the garage and shut the door for good.

For more than a quarter of a century the car has been left sheltered in the garage, away from the elements.

The Volvo was only discovered in March after the gentleman's death.

It was driven out of the garage in exactly the same condition as it was left when its engine was switched off in 1987.

The two-door 'timewarp' has covered a total of 132 miles, compared with the average 150,000 of most Volvos of a similar age.

The Swedish car is in an immaculate condition, and even boasts the original paper Volvo floor mats.

It is being sold at part of a probate sale and will go under the hammer next month at Anglia Car Auctions' Classic sale.

Hibernation: The elderly driver gave up his car keys, resigning the Volvo to the garage

Pristine: The car is in immaculate condition, having been stored in a garage away from the elements for nearly three decades

Discovery: The car was only found in March after its owner passed away. It is now being sold as part of his estate

A Volvo 340 of this age would normally only be worth around Â£250 - but this could sell for thousands with interest expected to be enormous.

Rob George, from Anglia Car Auctions, said: 'It is very difficult to put a price on a car like this.

'I hate saying a car is in time warp condition, but I have never seen anything like this car before.

'I hope whoever buys the car will enjoys the car and should be an interesting sale.

'It is exactly how it was when it was bought apart from the minor damage. It even has the Volvo paper mats.'

Despite its long hibernation the 340 starts and runs, though items like the brakes may well need attention.

There is no sign of corrosion on the car and the interior retains the new car smell.

Under the bonnet of the rear-wheel drive car is a 1.7-litre engine which develops a modest 80bhp.

This gives the 2-door model a 0-60mph time of 13.5 seconds and a top speed of 105mph.

The Volvo will be sold in King's Lynn on April 5.
