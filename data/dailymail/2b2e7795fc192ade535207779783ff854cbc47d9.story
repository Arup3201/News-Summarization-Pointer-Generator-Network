After a long-haul flight, most would feel nervous about going straight on a blind date.

But Bernardo the spectacled bear had the look of love after being flown 2,500 miles from the US to Britain to meet a potential partner.

The four-year-old endangered bear from Oklahoma recently arrived at Chester Zoo, Cheshire, in the hope he will woo Franka, the zoo's only female.

Bernardo could barely contain his excitement as he prowled around his new enclosure before he came face to face with her.

'Getting to know each other may involve a little bit of rough and tumble,' said Tim Rowlands, Chester Zoo's curator of mammals

He was transported in a specially designed crate to make the crossing over the Atlantic from Tulsa Zoo earlier this month for an initiative that will hopefully save the bears from extinction.

Numbers of spectacled bears - which are sometimes referred to as Andean Bears - have dwindled to around 2,000 in their native South America.

Poachers kill the bears for their meat, fur and gall bladders which are used as traditional oriental medicine which can fetch high prices on the international market.

One of the world's smallest bears, they grow to around 6ft long and live for up to 25 years

Tim Rowlands, the zoo’s curator of mammals said: ‘Bernardo arrived safely and is spending time exploring his new home.

‘Both he and Franka are finding ways of getting to know each other and that may involve a little bit of rough and tumble - but they’ll soon settle down.

‘Spectacled bears are by and large a mysterious species and not a great deal is known about them.

‘But by working closely with Bernardo, we hope our keepers will learn new things that could be very useful indeed in terms of ensuring the bears’ long-term survival.’

Wildly in love? Bernardo the bear

The spectacled bear is so called because of the white or yellow rings around its eyes that resemble glasses.

One of the world's smallest bears, they grow to around 6ft long and live for up to 25 years.

Their natural home is in the Andean jungles of South America - and they are the only type of bear to come from that continent.

A solitary animal, they are usually only seen together during mating season.

The bears have a predominantly vegetarian diet consisting of fruit, berries, cacti and honey - supplemented with the occasional small rodent or bird.

Only about 2,000 spectacled bears are believed to remain in the wild.
