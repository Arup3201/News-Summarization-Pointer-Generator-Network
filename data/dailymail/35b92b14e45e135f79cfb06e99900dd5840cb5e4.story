 

She's best friends with Cara Delevingne, is dating a Hollywood heartthrob and closed Burberry's SS15 show - could Suki Waterhouse get any cooler?

The British model, as well as walking the runway for Burberry, has been unveiled as the new face of the brand's latest beauty offering.

Suki, 22, showcases the results of the heritage label's new Fresh Glow Fluid Foundation Fluid and Fresh Glow Compact.

The luxury label, who broke into beauty this year, say their new products aim to leave you with an even, incredibly smooth and natural finish - just like Suki.

On Monday, all eyes were on Suki, who was given the honour of opening and closing Christopher Bailey's show.

Discovered: Suki was scouted in a pub when she was 16 and quit school to pursue a modelling career

Bradley Cooper's stunning girlfriend led the fashion pack down the runway for the show finale in a vivid printed red and pink trenchcoat.

Supermodels Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne swapped places and sat on the front row - dressed head to toe in Burberry, of course - to watch their 22-year-old BFF model the SS15 collection.

Insects of Britain was Bailey's point of reference and he translated this onto the catwalk via butterfly printed satin skirts, bags emblazoned with hand-drawn honey bees and his iconic trench reworked for SS15 in every colour in the rainbox from dragonfly blue to beetle green.

Suki showed us how to do organza for spring as she and the other Burberry girls stomped the catwalk in the most beautiful layered tulle dresses in poppy rosehip, which were sometimes teamed with lilac suede cropped jackets.

Waists were nipped with cobweb tulle belts, creating a waspish silhouette adhering to the theme of the show, which was watched from the frow by Anna Wintour, Poppy and Cara Delevingne, Kate Moss and Mario Testino.

Bailey, famed for his ability to reinvent the classics, reworked the iconic trench for next season in the brightest of hues with typographic prints and colourful high gloss collars.

In a rare twist, models wore exclusively flat shoes, including field sneakers (which of course Cara already owns a pair of and wore to the show) and leather sliders, meaning well-heeled fashionistas can breath a much-needed sigh of relief come spring.

After the show, Suki celebrated with her hunky Hollywood boyfriend Bradley Cooper but on Tuesday it was a girls' night.

Arm candy: Suki has been dating Hollywood heartthrob Bradley Cooper for over a year now and they dined in London together at the start of the week

The 22-year-old blonde model left Bradley at home as she partied up a storm at three different bashes with an array of fashion friends including Cara Delevingne, Daisy Lowe and Clara Paget. 

It was a night of party hopping for Suki who attended the J Crew and Vogue bash at Winfield House in Regent's Park with stars including Anna Wintour, Victoria Beckham, Ellie Goulding and Jourdan Dunn.

And as if that wasn't enough, she also made time to pop by London's EDITION hotel with her gal pals.

Suki's burgeoning career began after being scouted in a pub when she was 16 - she quit school to pursue a modelling career.  

By the age of 19, she was modelling lingerie for Marks and Spencer and has since worked with Swatch, H&M and Pepe Jeans.

Clearly not content with the catwalk, Suki will try her hand at acting as Marlene in the upcoming sequel The Divergent Series: Insurgent, based on the book of the same name.

Burberry has created a giant, limited edition 900ml bottle of their new My Burberry fragrance, which will retail at £2,000. This will be sold exclusively within Selfridges for a limited time.

Inspired by the trench coat and its heritage of British design and craftsmanship, My Burberry captures the fragrance of a London garden after the rain.

The luxury size collector's edition is accompanied by a complimentary fragrance applicator wand, crafted in glass and check-embossed metal. Presented in a suede pouch and gift box, the wand is designed to be dipped into the fragrance and applied to the skin 

Bigger and better? My Burberry, the fragrance fronted by Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne, has been unveiled in a 900ml bottle, similar in size to this, and will set you back £2,000
