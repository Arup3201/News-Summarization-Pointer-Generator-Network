Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is blaming ‘mixed messages’ sent by the Republican Party to voters for the loss of the White House while warning the party of the United States' changing majority.

In her first interview since President Obama's re-election, Rice blamed the GOP's failure over 'mixed messages’ in immigration and women's issues during the election campaign.

After women, black, Asian and Hispanic voters dominated Obama's supporters, she told CBS This Morning that the changing face of America 'really necessitates' new thinking.

Blame: In her first interview since President Obama's re-election Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice blamed the Republican party's loss on mixed messages sent by the party

'When you send mixed messages ... sometimes people hear only one side of that,' she said specifically of immigration when asked if she thought her party had been misunderstood.

Rice says the GOP came close to matching the Democrats in the popular vote. But she also acknowledges that 'clearly we are losing important segments' of the electorate.

Exit poll results showed 93 per cent of blacks, 71 per cent of Hispanics, and 73 per cent of Asians having voted Democrat this week.

Fifty-five per cent of women added to that support with men making up 52 per cent of Republican votes cast.

Rice added that the party needs to 'appeal to those groups.'

Responding to those numbers in agreement this week was Republican strategist John Stineman from Iowa.

'Clearly, when you look at African-American and Latino voters, they went overwhelmingly for the president,' he said. 'And that's certainly a gap that's going to require a lot of attention from Republicans.'

Naming her own attempt to bridge that gap she said was the speech she delivered at the Republican National Convention in August.

Bridging the gap: Speaking at the Republican National Convention, the former secretary said immigration is not just a key to an election's demographics but who we are as America

‘I said that I thought for instance immigration was a key to not just the demographics of an election but to who we are as Americas,’ she said. ‘That’s really the argument that we need to be making.’

Asked if she would be interested in succeeding Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state, even if asked to do so by President Obama, she readily said she'd decline the offer.

'I'm going to support my president but I'm going to stay at Stanford,' she said, referring to her role as professor of Political Economy at the California university.
