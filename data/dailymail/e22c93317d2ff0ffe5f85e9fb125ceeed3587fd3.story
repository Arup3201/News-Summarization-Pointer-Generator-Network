Reconnaissance photos captured by Cold War-era spy satellites have tripled the number of known archaeological sites across the Middle East, revealing thousands of ancient cities, roads, canals, and other ruins.

The archaeologists behind the new CORONA Atlas of the Middle East report that a survey of satellite images has revealed thousands of previously undiscovered sites in Iraq, Turkey and Syria – including long-lost cities that could be among the earliest in human history.

‘Some of these sites are gigantic, and they were completely unknown,’ said University of Arkansas archaeologist Jesse Casana at the launch of the atlas during the Society for American Archaeology’s annual conference on Thursday.

Reconnaissance photos captured by Cold War-era spy satellites have tripled the number of known archaeological sites across the Middle East, for instance this 1961 satellite photo shows Tell Rifaat in northwest Syria, which is now completely surrounded by a modern town

‘We can see all kinds of things – ancient roads and canals. The images provide a very comprehensive picture.’

The images were taken by the first generation of United States spy satellites - a system code-named CORONA - dating from 1960-1972. The photos were intended to expose Soviet missile bases and military camps, reports National Geographic.

CORONA images were acquired on large rolls of black-and-white film, and because no means of transmitting images remotely had yet been developed, canisters of film, once exposed, were ejected and parachuted to earth where they were intercepted in mid-air by a plane.

The archive, consists of more than 
860,000 satellite images covering much of the world, was declassified by
 President Bill Clinton in 1995.

The University of Arkansas¿ Center for Advanced Spatial Technologies (CAST) has now developed methods for efficient orthorectification of CORONA imagery and now provides free public access to the imagery database

Until recently the photos had limited use as the unique imaging geometry of the CORONA satellite cameras, which produced long, narrow film strips, made correcting spatial distortions in the images a laborious task.

The University of Arkansas’ Center for Advanced Spatial Technologies (CAST) has now developed methods for efficient orthorectification of CORONA imagery and now provides free public access to the imagery database.

The images of the Middle East have proved to be an invaluable resource in the archaeology of the region because they pre-date the widespread construction of reservoirs, urban expansion, and agricultural intensification the area has undergone in recent decades.

Surveying land from Egypt to Iran - and encompassing the Fertile Crescent, the renowned cradle of civilization and location of some of humanity's earliest cities – the spy-satellite images have revealed 10,000 sites that had previously been unknown.

The largest sites, in Syria and Turkey, are most likely Bronze Age cities and include ruined walls and citadels.

Many of the CORONA images cover other areas of great interest to archaeologists, including Africa and China.

The photos were intended to expose Soviet missile bases and military camps, a missile launch site near Chelyabinsk in the USSR is outlined in this 1969 image
