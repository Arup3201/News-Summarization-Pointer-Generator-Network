Olympic judo silver medallist Gemma Gibbons admits it will be somewhat surreal fighting for gold at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow on the same day as her husband Euan Burton - but intends to ensure bragging rights for England when they get back home.

Gibbons' emotional semi-final victory at ExCeL, when she paid tribute to her late mother, was one of the most memorable moments of London 2012.

However, the 27-year-old - who suffered a broken thumb en route to her Olympic success - has only recently returned to the Tatami following a terrible run of fitness problems which included a fractured wrist, shoulder reconstruction surgery and ankle issues.

Rivals: Gibbons will be competing for England, whilst husband Euan Burton will represent Scotland in Glasgow

After being drafted into a 14-strong Team England squad following injury to another Glasgow hopeful, Edinburgh-based Gibbons is determined to make the most of her opportunity to show her true talents once again.

Gibbons and Burton - one of Scotland's leading medal hopes after deciding to take up a place at under-100kgs in the team he helps coach - are both set to fight on the final day of competition at the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre next weekend, with judo back in the Commonwealth Games for the first time since Manchester 2002.

'I have never competed for Team England before, it has always been Great Britain, and that is the same for Euan, and we are set to compete on the same day.

'It will be strange, but also quite cool because I don't think there are many other athletes out there that get to say they are competing in a Commonwealth Games with their husband, but for different teams,' she said.

'Even though I am competing for Team England, I live in Scotland now and train up there full-time as well, so it will feel like a home games for me.'

Gibbons added: 'I had not competed on the international stage in about nine months, and as any athlete knows, if you have had that amount of time off, then it takes another good couple of months to get your fitness back, especially with a sport like judo, which is so technical.

'You just have to keep going through the injuries, getting back on the mat and turning up for training. It is more the stuff like the rehab which takes it out of you mentally.

'But I fully believe I am the best player in that weight category and believe I can win.

'I am going for the gold, nothing else is going to be good enough for me, that is my goal.'

Burton, born in Ascot, Berkshire, but raised in Edinburgh, endured starkly different emotions at the London Olympics, following a bitterly disappointing first-round exit when he had targeted a place on the podium.

The 35-year-old, once ranked in the top four at half-middleweight and a twice former world championship bronze medallist, opted to fill a vacant slot on the JudoScotland squad for Glasgow at under-100kgs - which comes with its own hazards.

'He stepped up from under-81kgs, but at under-90kgs, Scotland have a lot of good fighters. However, at the weight above, they have only got one and you can take two in each weight,' Gibbons explained.

'As Euan is a coach at JudoScotland now, he was like "there is no way I can actually take someone's spot. I don't feel comfortable with that" - so now he is fighting some monsters.

'When he was at a tournament in South America, he was in the final against a big Brazilian and got thrown so hard on the back of his head he was knocked out, but he is big guy and can look after himself.

'I am not worried because we both know what judo is like and you very rarely get serious injuries and is a sport we both love doing.

'He will be fine - I just have to stuff him full of burgers to get his weight up before fights.'
