Whether or not Kate Middleton is officially overdue is subject to much speculation, but one thing is for sure: reporters covering the royal birth are overdue some sleep.

Some royal correspondents, including NBC anchor Natalie Morales, have been camped out in front of the Duchess 
of Cambridge's hospital of choice, St Mary's, for days and even weeks with very 
little news to dine out on. 

In the absence of a royal baby 
and uncharacteristically scorching temperatures in London, reporters 
have had to find ways to cool down and fill in the hours - and the results have been 
entertaining.

Practice interviews: The GMA crew weren't the only members of the media resorting to interviews with other journalists, as the palace has remained quiet about baby news

As the world waits with bated breath, U.S. reporters in London to cover the big story are, well, more bored than anything else.

Kate’s due date was widely reported as being last Saturday, July 13, and the
 world's press has been  stationed outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary's 
Hospital in London ever since to ensure they don't miss the 
new arrival.

But the only confirmation from Kate has 
been that she was due in ‘mid-July’. Since babies can are most often born within a week either side of the 40-week mark, It could days yet before the baby comes.

All this brings no comfort to the the media in limbo outside the Lindo.

'Have this baby already, Kate, please?' 
implored Morales on NBC's Today on Friday, though she didn't look too miserable as she partook of fish and chips and a 
pint of bitter from her chair outside the hospital.

“There are people everywhere. I don’t know what they are doing, but (they’re here) all the time, anytime — morning and night,” Lea Fortunato, a researcher at Imperial College London’s Faculty of Medicine, next door to the hospital told the National Post.

She said that reporters are there when she arrives for work and there when she leaves.

'They started camping last week. I didn’t think they would camp!' said Million Moyo, a deputy manager in the emergency ward of St Mary’s. 'Most people [at the hospital] are really intrigued.”

Inside the metal barricades enclosing the world's media to keep them off the roads, members of the press are starting to go a little stir-crazy. Last week, a camera operator from NBC set up a betting pool based on the baby's sex, the day the baby will arrive and what time.

Not satisfied with that small entertainment, he attached bright neon 'for sale' tags to the ladders left behind by photographers the night before. 'Post Partum Ladder Sale,' read one tag. “Will Swap for a Mars Bar,' read another, reported the National Post.

Morales has been knitting a pink bootie live on NBC’s flagship Today program.

‘I
 think it may be even bigger news at home than it is here,’ she said, 
adding: ‘Once Kate goes into labor, we’ll be sleeping 
right here.’

Morales may have a point:

'Americans are obsessed with the birth of the royal baby,' pop culture expert Katrina Szish told Today.

'Not only is it 
not just a phenomena we don't have in the United States but it really is
 a fairytale come true,' she said.

Meanwhile, Kate,
 31, stayed at the home of her parents Carole and Michael Middleton in 
Berkshire last weekend, while William played in two long-standing 
charity polo matches.

Adding to the rumors, tip-offs and fevered speculation, the Duchess of Cornwall dropped a 
tantalizing hint on Monday that the wait could soon be over, telling 
well-wishers she expects the little boy or girl to arrive imminently.

Camilla revealed during a visit to a 
children's hospice near St Austell, Cornwall: 'We are all just waiting 
by the telephone. We are hopeful that by the end of the week he or she 
will be here.'

However, last Wednesday the Queen appeared to suggest that the baby was already late.

She told a 10-year-old schoolgirl on a trip to Cumbria: 'I would very much like it to arrive because I’m going on holiday 
soon... I wish it would hurry up.'

Outside the hospital are scores of people, not just media, who are anxiously awaiting for the royal arrival.

Pat and Norman Bate took two months to
 get to St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington because the retired fruit and 
veg merchants travelled from their Liverpool home to London via 
Britain’s canal network  at four mph.

Their 55-foot canal boat Ellie May, is moored just behind the royal 
hospital, filled with bagfuls of cards and presents for the baby, and its cabin draped with bunting.

‘As soon as we heard Kate was pregnant, I
 said that we should aim to get there for the birth, so we left home on 
May 1,’ Mrs Bate said.

‘And we hope to be here as long as it takes. After
 all, we’re not paying for a hotel.’

Prime position: Terry Hutt, who has been living on a bench outside the hospital for over a week waits patiently

A retired carpenter from Cambridge has been a familiar fixture at major 
royal events for years, always dressed head to toe in Union Jack clothes
 beneath a Union Jack umbrella hat. The Royal Family, he says, know him 
as ‘The Umbrella Man’.

Terry,
 78, has been here so long that, a few days ago, he felt compelled to 
take himself back to Cambridge for a bath and a change of clothes. He 
then returned to London with enough spare Union Jack kit to last him as 
long as it takes.

‘What’s another week?’ he says. ‘It’s not boring and it gives my wife a rest from me.’
