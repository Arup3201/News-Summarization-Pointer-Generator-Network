Gratitude: Anna Wing was a regular at the Turkish restaurant in central London and left the tip in her will as a 'token'

EastEnders star Anna Wing left £5 to a restaurant boss among the £90,000 legacy she bequeathed in her will.

The actress, who the cantankerous Lou Beale between 1985 and 1988, stated that the legacy to Kazim Akkus - the owner of Efes and Efes 2 in London's West End - was 'a token of gratitude for all his generosity'.

Wing, who died in July at the age of 98, was a regular customer for more than 30 years at Mr Akkus's Turkish restaurants.

Probate records released last week reveal that she left the bulk of her estate in trust for her two sons as well as individual legacies to charities, relatives and friends.

Mr Akkus said the gift was a 'lovely surprise' from a loyal customer, who, he said, loved his 'hummus, taramasalata and kebabs'.

Wing always left 'one or two pounds' as tips for his staff, the 71-year-old restaurateur said.

Mr Akkus said: 'I am really touched that she remembered me in this way.

'She was a regular and used to come in once or twice every week.

'But she came in less as she got older because she had problems walking and I think I last saw her about three years ago.

'She would always love to have a chat while she was having a coffee or something to eat.'

Mr Akkus said Wing had mentioned that she wanted to leave him something, but he had refused.

'Once she told me that she wanted to leave me quite a large legacy in her will, but I told her that I did not want it as it should be going to her family,' he said.

Loyal customer: Efes Restaurant in Great Titchfield Street, which Wing visited on a weekly basis until her health declined, according to owner Kazim Akkus

'But it is nice that she still decided to leave me a little something. She was a lovely lady.'

Mr Akkus initially served Anna at his Efes restaurant.

He left the restaurant around ten years ago but continued to serve her in his new Efes 2 nearby.

Wing also left her Steinway square grand piano to Richard Niazi, who also ran a West End Turkish restaurant -  the Sarastro in Drury Lane.

But Mr Niazi died in 2008 so he did not receive the gift.

Veteran: Wing was a familiar presence in Albert Square until her character was killed off in 1988

Wing featured in 232 episodes of EastEnders until her character's death, having joined when the series was launched.

Her other TV roles included appearances in Doctor Who, Casualty, Silent Witness and The Bill.

Anna was made an MBE in the 2009 Birthday Honours for services to drama and charity.

Her will, drawn up in 2004, left £1,000 to each of her five grandchildren and £500 each to Help The Aged, Age Concern and St Luke's Hospital for the Clergy.

The remainder or her estate was left in trust for her sons - actor and director Mark Wing-Davey, 64, and Jon Wing-O'Connor.

Wing-Davey was the child of Wing's three-year marriage to actor Peter Davey which ended in divorce.

Wing-O'Connor was born from her seven year relationship with writer Philip O'Connor.
