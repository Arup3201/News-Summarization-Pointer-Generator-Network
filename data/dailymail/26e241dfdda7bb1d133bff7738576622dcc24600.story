Sporting Lisbon manager Marco Silva has admitted that a move to England may be on the cards for William Carvalho.

The 22-year-old Portuguese defensive midfielder has been linked with Arsenal this year, as well as a number of other Barclays Premier League clubs.

And Carvalho's boss acknowledged the interest from England ahead of the Champions League match with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night.

In quotes reported by ITV, Silva said: 'William is a target for English teams, but I want him to play his game.

'He's not playing at the same level as last season because last season he was a surprise, but he's improving. William has many offers. Let's wait till January.'

In an interview in October with the official magazine of the Portuguese Football Federation, Carvalho admitted that he hoped 'one day to be playing in the best leagues in the world, the English or Spanish'.
