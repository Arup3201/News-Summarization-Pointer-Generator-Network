There was trouble brewing at the tea shop when monarchist Anita Atkinson invited her customers to stand for the National Anthem.

While most duly obliged, three elderly women resolutely remained seated.

A furious Mrs Atkinson could not let this insult pass, so she gave the grey-haired trio their marching orders.

‘I was shocked, but it’s my tearoom,’ said 55-year-old Mrs Atkinson. ‘Everyone knows it has a royal theme. We play patriotic music and there’s memorabilia over the walls, so if they didn’t like it, why did they come in?’

Royalist: Anita Atkinson sent the three dissidents packing when they refused to stand up for the National Anthem

Mrs Atkinson, Deputy Lord Lieutenant of Durham, has leased a shop in the village of Stanhope from April to August, to cover the Diamond Jubilee celebrations.

She calls her cafe Royal Teas and it features hand-painted Union Jack chairs and even a Union Jack lavatory in the ‘Throne Room’.

Visitors from Germany, Spain and Australia have already enjoyed her hospitality. Customers are served on Mrs Atkinson’s own collection of royal crockery and encounter life-size cut-outs of the Queen, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge.

There are books and newspaper clippings documenting significant royal moments in a bookcase for patrons to flick through.

And at 3pm every day, the National Anthem is played by a musical helium balloon.

Anita Atkinson (above), who owns royal-themed tearoom Royal Teas in County Durham, threw out a group of grey-haired women after they refused to stand for the National Anthem

‘The whole thing is just meant to be a bit of fun,’ Mrs Atkinson said yesterday. ‘Some customers stand with their hands on their hearts, just like the Americans.

‘On Saturday I announced, “Ladies and gentlemen, please be upstanding for Her Majesty the Queen”.

‘Everyone – including four teenagers – stood up, apart from these  three ladies who were all looking a bit miserable. One said, “I’m not standing”. So I asked, “Will you just please leave then?”. These ladies had come in for a coffee but were looking for trouble.

‘They were shaking their heads and making a scene and would not stand up. As they were leaving they said they weren’t going to pay. In the end, two of them paid and one of them threw a pound in change at the counter and said my coffee was rubbish and that’s all it was worth.

Mrs Atkinson, 55, plays the National Anthem at 3pm every day and customers are expected to stand for the occasion

‘They deliberately talked through the National Anthem and were grumbling all the way out. I don’t know their views on the monarchy, but the tea room is just meant to be fun.

‘My husband says the customer is always right, but those ladies were rude and aggressive to me.’

Mrs Atkinson, a grandmother, who camped out for two nights ahead of the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge last year, began collecting memorabilia at the age of 21 when relatives bought her royal mementoes for her birthday in 1977 – Silver Jubilee year.

She now has more than 5,000 items but has had to cede her Guinness World Record for the largest collection of royal memorabilia to a woman in Australia.
