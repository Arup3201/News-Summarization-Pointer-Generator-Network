Her designs have been worn by the likes of Cameron Diaz and Blake Lively and in 2011, she beat off stiff competition from the likes of Stella McCartney and Tom Ford to be crowned Designer of the Year at the prestigious British Fashion Awards.

However, while the world can't get enough of Victoria Beckham - she was named one of the UK's most influential women in BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour 2013 Power List - two industry heavyweights aren't exactly her biggest fans.

Designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano 
Gabbana of Italian label Dolce & Gabanna this week praised Britain's 'cool' style and 
designers like Vivienne Westwood, but were less enthusiastic about 
Victoria.

Not her biggest fans: Designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana of Italian label Dolce & Gabanna spoke about Victoria Beckham's designs with a lack of enthusiasm

Speaking at the launch of The Glamour of Italian Fashion, a new exhibition at the Victoria & Albert Museum, Gabbana said the former Spice Girl had turned to 
fashion after doing 'many, many, many different things.'

Victoria may have served as an ambassador for the Italian fashion house but Gabbana continued: 'she's a designer but...for us, she don't make (clothes) the same way like a fashion designer.'

Dolce
 grouped Beckham, whose designs have appeared on catwalks at New York 
Fashion week, with mainstream retailers such as Zara and H&M.

The
 museum's exhibition, which opens Saturday, traces the global rise of 
Italian style, from the rebuilding of a shattered economy after World 
War II through the 1950s and '60s, when stars including Elizabeth Taylor
 and Audrey Hepburn made Italian design synonymous with sophistication.

It
 also looks at how Italy's fashion and textile industries are coping 
with the globalised 'fast fashion' world of the 21st century.

The
 show, which runs until July 27, features designs from fashion houses 
including Giorgio Armani, Prada, Gucci, Valentino and Versace - and of 
course, Dolce & Gabbana.

Nonetheless, Victoria Beckham recently revealed that she
 wants to design footwear in a conversation with Parsons' Dean of 
Fashion, Simon Collins, in New York.

The event was attended by over 800 fashion students and fans, according to Fashionista.com, and saw the designer, 39, open up about the future of her empire.

'You know, I do want to start a shoe collection,' she said. 'If anybody here is a shoe designer, please do come and see 
me! I definitely think shoes is probably the next category that I’ll 
look at going into; it's quite a competitive category but I would love 
to go into [it].

Mrs Beckham admitted that she does not expect it to be easy though.

'I actually work with Manolo Blahnik on the shoes for my
show every season and working with him is remarkable,' she said. 'I think it’s very
complicated… I wouldn’t just want to do a signature shoe - I'd have to 
make sure I’m working with the right factories, do a flat…'

All the colours of the rainbow: Glamour magazine
 has put together a montage of 40 A-listers wearing Victoria Beckham's 
dress designs

As Victoria prepares to turn 40 in April, Glamour magazine have celebrated some of her finest designs.

The publication has put together a fun rainbow montage of 40 A-listers who have worn 40 of Victoria's stunning dress designs.

Beyoncé,
 Kelly Rowland, Jennifer Lopez, Cameron Diaz, Oprah Winfrey and Kim 
Kardashian are just some of the famous names who feature on the page.

Supermodel Naomi Campbell recently told You magazine that she's a huge fan of the former Spice Girl's work.

'I love Victoria Beckham's dresses - I
 have many of them, as well as her jeans. I admire her work and she's a 
great mother and good friend.'

Time to celebrate: The looks can all be found in the May Issue of Glamour magazine

And Cheryl Cole also said: 'I think that what she has done is brilliant. I'd love to do what she is doing.'

Victoria
 launched her jeans line VB Rocks for Rock & Republic in Japan in 
October 2004, before launching her own denim line dVb Style and an 
eyewear range in 2006.

In September 2008, Victoria received rave reviews for her first collection for spring/summer 2009 at New York Fashion Week.

She
 went on to win Designer Brand of the Year at the British Fashion Awards
 in November 2011 and she recently announced her first store will launch
 in London's Dover street this autumn.

An interest in fashion clearly runs in the family, as Victoria's eldest son, 15-yer-old Brooklyn, has made his modelling debut.

The teenager appears on the cover of Man About Town magazine in a black and white photo shoot which evokes the old Hollywood images of a young James Dean.

The
 pictures were taken by photographer Alasdair McLellan, who shot 
Victoria for UK Vogue and David for Fantastic Man, and is a 'friend of 
the family'.

The May issue of GLAMOUR is on sale from Thursday 3rd April.
