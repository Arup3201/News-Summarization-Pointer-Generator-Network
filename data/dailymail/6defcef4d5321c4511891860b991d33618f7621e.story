A tunnel long enough to span the English Channel could be built beneath some of Britain’s most beautiful countryside following environmental concerns about a £1billion potash mine scheme.

The ambitious engineering project would see a 22-mile tunnel constructed up to 1,100ft under the North York Moors national park.

The company behind the mine, Sirius Minerals, wants to dig two mine shafts to a depth of 1,500 metres and extract the mineral polyhalite – a type of potash used as a fertiliser.

Countryside: The tunnel, 1,500 metres under ground, was designed in response to environmental concerns

Originally the company wanted to move the mineral in slurry form via a pipeline near the surface.

But objectors were concerned that the pipeline would scar and damage the countryside. The proposed solution, which will be submitted to planning authorities later this year, would see the rock transported from the mine to a six metre-wide underground tunnel.

It could then be transported on a conveyor belt from the mine near Sneaton to the processing plant – adding £170million to the cost of the scheme, but reducing its total footprint by 70 per cent.

The tunnel would be as long as the section of Channel Tunnel below the sea and its construction would bring more than a million cubic metres of rock to the surface – enough to fill Wembley Stadium.

The firm in charge of the mine has claimed it would create up to 6,000 jobs, boost the economy by up to £1billion a year and provide the Government with £300million annually in tax payments.

More than 400 landowners are also keeping their fingers crossed that the tunnel wins over objectors in the green lobby. Many of them are struggling farmers, but would become millionaires if the mineral is mined below their fields, as they stand to receive a share of the mine’s total annual revenue.

Chris Fraser, the chief executive of Sirius Minerals, said: ‘This  would minimise our impact at the surface, removing the need for any construction in protected habitats.’

However Tom Chadwick, from the North Yorkshire Moors Association, said: ‘The tunnel is absolutely enormous, there’s no doubt about that. But we reserve judgment as to whether this new scheme will be any better than the last one.’
