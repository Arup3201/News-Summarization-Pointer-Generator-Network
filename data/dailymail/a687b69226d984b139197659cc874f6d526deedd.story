An obese mother was shocked into shedding a seven stone after a neighbour told her she looked like Buddha.

Natalie White Doodson, 28, from Glossop, Derbyshire, wore a dress size 22 and weighed 17 stone 2lb when she was compared with the spiritual figure, often depicted as a tubby cross-legged man.

But eight months after cutting out processed food, sugar and her crisps and chocolate habit she slimmed to a size eight and now weighs just ten stone.

Natalie White Doodson was shamed into confronting her weight gain when a neighbour called her a 'Buddha'

The property developer, hear on her wedding day with husband Gavin, hadn't weighed herself for five years

She said: 'I was so shocked when I heard the words "fat little Buddha" I knew I needed to do something about my weight.

'Now I'm a whole new person. It's the best feeling in the world knowing I'm not "the fat one" any more.'

At her largest, Natalie was terrified of breaking furniture or getting stuck on swings at the playground because of her giant frame, even though she's only 5ft 5in. 

She even believed that her five-year-old daughter was embarrassed when she stood next to other mums, who were sometimes half her size, in the playground.

The property developer had not weighed herself since her daughter was born and was self-conscious in front of her husband Gavin.

But when in April 2014, as she rested on a wall, a neighbour said the words, 'You look like a fat little Buddha sitting there', she knew she had to act.

Before dropping from a size 22 to a size eight, Natalie felt that her size embarrassed her young daughter

Natalie said: 'Just taking my little girl to the playground used to be a struggle - I was scared that I would get wedged on a slide or break a bench under my weight.

'I couldn't be the mum I wanted and I think my daughter was embarrassed that I was the fat mum at the school gates. 

'When my neighbour nipped over and just said 'You look like a fat little Buddha sitting there Natalie,' it was the final straw.

'I know it wasn't meant to be cruel, it was just an off-hand comment, but it really hit home that I needed to take action.

'I signed up to do the Cambridge Weight Plan the next day and I've never looked back. I can't thank him enough now.' 

A neighbour's off-hand comment that she looked like 'a fat little Buddha' kickstarted an eight-month diet

Since going on her diet plan, Natalie has cut out all processed food, sugar and her unhealthy snacks

Natalie had tried Weight Watchers and a juice diet before to no avail but since a friend had slimmed down with the Cambridge Weight Plan, she signed up on the spur of the moment.

'I knew it would be hard but I cried when I got on the scales for the first time in five years and my consultant Caroline Robinson read out that I weighed more than 17 stone,' she said.

Breakfast: Coffee, full-fat milk and four sugars

Lunch: Large cheese sandwich with mayonnaise and salad cream

Dinner: Lasagne, chips, daughter's leftovers

Snacks: Three bags of crisps, three chocolate bars

AFTER 

Breakfast: Peanut butter bar

Lunch: Healthy vegetable soup

Dinner: Grilled chicken and roasted vegetables

'But it really has turned out to be so simple. I don't know why I didn't do it before.

'I look at the labels on the things I used to have in my cupboards - all the chocolate, crisps and sweets - and can't believe I ever ate them.

'I used to think that all the bad stuff tasted so good. I've had to completely change the way I think to challenge my diet.'

In the first week she lost 8lb after cutting out processed fats, sugars and snacks.

In eight months she has dropped more than seven stone  and now has no fears about the being compared to a fat little statue.

'I still feel like a size 22 inside sometimes and I have to remind myself that I'm not. I don't look like a fat little Buddha any more - everyone says I look great.

'The weight came off so quickly that all my clothes were too big and I had nothing to wear. 

'My friend runs a clothes shop called Girls and Curves and she donated outfits to fit my new figure.

'Thankfully I know that I'll never be compared to a Buddha again!'
