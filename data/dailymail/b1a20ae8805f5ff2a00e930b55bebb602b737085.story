The mother of one of Jerry Sandusky’s alleged child sex assault victims said she is infuriated by the lack of action taken against the former coach and revealed her son is still traumatized by the alleged abuse.

'Victim number one' told his mother that he didn't feel he had any power to resist the former Penn State assistant football coach, telling her 'you can't say no to Jerry' and was too shamed to come forward sooner.

As well as the 40 counts against him in Pennsylvania, prosecutors in Texas say they have opened an investigation into the possibility of also filing charges, following the release of grand jury testimony 
indicating Sandusky may have sexually assaulted one of his young victims
when Penn State was in San Antonio for the 1999 Alamo Bowl.

'We are looking into the possibility 
that an offense may have happened in San Antonio,' San Antonio Police 
Sergeant Chris Benavides said.

Unsealed grand jury testimony in the 
Sandusky case in Pennsylvania indicates a now 27-year-old man described 
in the transcript as 'Victim Number Four' testified he was brought to 
San Antonio as part of the 'Sandusky family party' to watch the Nittany 
Lions beat Texas A&M in the 1999 Alamo Bowl.

The man testified that when he resisted Sandusky's advances, the coach threatened to 'send him home'.

The mother of 'victim number one' spoke to Good Morning America and said she was horrified when she heard the details about what allegedly took place in the basement of Sadusky's home and at the school.

She said: 'I was horrified. I was absolutely 
horrified. I knew some 
details but I didn't know that it was that, I didn't know it was that 
bad. It's caused a lot of nightmares, for him and I both.'

She said she first became suspicious when her son asked her about researching 'sex weirdos' online to see if the former coach was on there.

Baseball legend Cal Ripken Jr has asked that Second Mile, a charity allegedly used by former Penn State football assistant Jerry Sandusky to meet and then molest young boys, to remove his name from its website and other literature.

Before Thursday, his name was under the heading 'Board of Directors: Honorary Board' and has now been taken off.

According to spokesman John Maroon, the Hall of Fame former Oriole spoke at an event benefiting the charity but did so at the behest of a corporate partner of the Cal Ripken S. Foundation.

After speaking, Ripken had his name listed on the website but did not do further work with the organization.

Former Notre Dame football coach Lou Holtz also had his name removed from the Second Mile's site, while legendary golfer Arnold Palmer, Philadelphia Eagles coach Andy Reid and actor Mark Wahlberg did not.

She recalls: 'I asked my son if there was 
something he needed to tell me, if there was something going on. It 
wasn't 'til a month later when he indicated he was uncomfortable with 
leaving the school with him, and (Sandusky) pulling him out of classes 
at school.

'I have no idea how this went on for so long. But I want justice, I want him to be locked up. There is no help for someone who does this.'

Her son was just 11 years old when he first met Sandusky and would often stay at his home alone in the basement.

High school administrators have also admitted that he would pull her son out of class for unsupervised visits and a wrestling coach said he saw Sandusky lying on top of the child in an empty weights room.

When she spoke to her son about it, she revealed: 'I said to him: "You know, maybe we should have come to this conclusion earlier, you should have told me".

'He was like, "Well, I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know what to do, and you just can’t tell Jerry no".

'I'm infuriated. Even if they had the 
slightest inclination that anything inappropriate was going on it should
have been reported, or at least brought to my attention.

'I didn't even know he was leaving the school with my 
child, taking him out of classes. They never told me that.'

According to the grand jury report detailing the 40 counts of sexual abuse facing Sandusky, the coach had the boy stay overnight at his home, took him to professional and college sporting events and showered him with gifts, 'including golf clubs, a computer, gym clothes, dress clothes and cash'.

The grand jury in the Texas case, involving 'victim number four' also indicates that Sandusky showered him with gifts and told him he would be considered as a walk-on player at Penn State if he agreed to his sexual advances.

Fitting title: Amazon reviewers lashed out at Jerry Sandusky's book Touched, which was released in 2001

Bexar County First Assistant District Attorney Cliff Herberg says, although authorities are investigating, they don't have a lot to go on.

'All we have at this point is an allegation contained in an indictment from another jurisdiction,' Mr Herberg said today. 'So we have no evidence, we have no case, we have no complainant yet.

'We will have to determine the quality of the evidence, given that it (is) from 1999, on whether we can pursue a case.'

The scandal over the charges in Pennsylvania led to the firing this week of legendary football coach Joe Paterno and university president Graham Spanier.

Since the scandal emerged, a book written by Sandusky in 2001 has been thrust into the spotlight again. 'Touched', which is available to buy on Amazon, tells the story of the former coach's life in his own words.

A synopsis on Amazon said: 'From his childhood to his professional career, this book goes behind the scenes to explore the successes and challenges that Jerry Sandusky has faced in life, both on and off the football field.

'The book also explores Sandusky's involvement in children's charities, including the founding of his charity, Second Mile.

A number of Amazon reviewers used the site to lash out at the former coach, leaving negative angry comments about Sandusky and the accusations against him.
