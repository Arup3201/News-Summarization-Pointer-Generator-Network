Lyndsey White was left furious after Interflora failed to deliver a £60 bouquet to her mother, Jill

You mess up Mother’s Day at your peril – and pay reputable florists a lot of money to make sure things go smoothly.

Spare a thought then for hundreds of Interflora customers who ordered bouquets which were subsequently dumped on their mothers’ doorsteps, arrived infested with bugs – or simply didn’t materialise at all.

The flower delivery firm was forced to issue more than 100 apologies online after customers took to social networking sites to complain about poor service.

Lyndsey White, 36, was one of those left infuriated when the firm failed to deliver a £60 basket of flowers to her mother, Jill, 65.

Miss White lives in America and trusted the company to deliver her order directly to her parents’ home in Healing, Lincolnshire.

But it never arrived, leaving her mother in tears. She said: ‘I got an e-mail saying they had been delivered, so I rang mum to see if she liked them and it turned out they hadn’t arrived.

'I rang Interflora and they said they would be with us in the next hour but they didn’t arrive at all.’

The response of the customer services team at Interflora only angered Miss White further.

Miss White, who works in marketing, said: ‘I wanted to make my mum feel special. It would have been lovely if it had actually arrived.

‘But when I rang them they just kept saying it was a very small percentage of their orders that had a problem. What sort of excuse is that?

Customers took to Twitter to complain about the poor service and Interflora made apologies every few minutes

'That may be the case but even if it is just 300 people on Mother’s Day that is far too many.’

Yesterday angry customers flocked to online forums with complaints ranging from delivery issues to the quality of the flowers.

Margaret
 de Havilland-Hall wrote on the company’s Facebook page bemoaning the 
difference between the flowers shown on the website and the ones 
delivered for her mother.

She said: ‘There are no flowers at all, the bowl is tiny and had fallen over so the plants were squashed.’

Many customers were left outraged, having paid an extra fee to have their flowers delivered by midday – which never arrived at all.

Tony Turnbull wrote: ‘Ordered a Mother’s Day delivery online paid for it all and then received an e-mail saying that it won’t be delivered till Monday, a bit late don’t you think?’

Other customers complained of flowers being ‘dumped on the doorstep’ when the door wasn’t answered in time, and plants arriving infested with bugs.

Bizarrely, one mother found her flowers decked with black funeral ribbons.

Last night there was no statement from Interflora despite repeated attempts to contact them.
