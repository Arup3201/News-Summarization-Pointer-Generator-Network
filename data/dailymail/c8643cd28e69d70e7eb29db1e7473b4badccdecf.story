Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, based at 100 Parliament Street (pictured), wants the power to take money directly from accounts

The taxman cannot be trusted to enact ‘excessive’ new money-grabbing powers properly, accountants have warned.

They say Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs is ‘a pretty dysfunctional department’, and allowing it to seize money from bank accounts could lead to an erosion of trust.

In a savage assessment of the controversial proposals to recoup unpaid tax bills, the majority of accountants said the powers are unnecessary – and the HMRC is not fit to oversee them.

The warning comes as MPs today grill the department’s chief executive Lin Homer about the proposals, which were announced in the Budget in March.

Under the plan – currently subject to a public consultation which ends on July 29 – HMRC wants the right to be able to take money directly from bank accounts.

If it believes taxpayers owe money, it can take the cash directly from a current account, joint account or even tax-free Isa to settle an unpaid tax bill.

One of the biggest concerns is that HMRC will not need to apply to the courts to get permission to seize the money.

Around 17,000 people a year are expected to have money taken under the proposed new powers.

HMRC insists taxpayers will only be targeted if they owe £1,000 or more to the taxman, have been contacted by HMRC at least four times and would have at least £5,000 left across all their accounts after the money has been removed.

But Rebecca Benneyworth, of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, warned the department is ‘shooting itself in the foot.’

She said: ‘Public trust in HMRC would be eroded very quickly if cases come to light where funds have been incorrectly removed. If the consequences of that are devastating to individual taxpayers, that erosion could become a landslide.

‘HMRC cannot afford to have public opinion turn against the tax system and those charged with administering it. This really could be a case of shooting oneself in the foot.’

HMRC is giving under heavy criticism for its desire to take money directly from people's bank accounts

There are concerns around joint accounts such as those set up to pay the bills for an elderly person. For example, an elderly woman in a care home might pay money into a joint account to fund her bills, but have no idea that one of her children who administers the account owes tax.

Paul Aplin, a tax partner at the accountants AC Mole & Sons, told the ICAEW conference about the catalogue of problems experienced by his own clients.

One client was chased for £9,500 in a PAYE tax debt, which had already been paid. Another was chased for £11,000 in a VAT debt which, again, had already been paid.

Speaking at the conference, Jonathan Schwarz, a barrister at the Temple Tax Chambers, said: ‘Why is it that HMRC is asking for these powers?

‘A power which is stripped of judicial supervision goes beyond what is necessary to achieve these objectives and undermines the essential elements of a constitutional democracy.

‘The only purpose of this proposal is to circumvent the jurisdiction of the courts in applying the rules relating to the seizing of assets.’ He said the rules should be redrawn.

Anthony Thomas, of the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, said: ‘I don’t honestly think you can trust HMRC to do the job properly. I think it is regrettably a pretty dysfunctional department even today and a long way from being able to do this job properly.’

An HMRC spokesman said it is having ‘a series of constructive conversations with accountants’ before the consultation closes in a few weeks’ time.

Just weeks after the proposals were announced in March, the ICAEW warned MPs they were ‘extremely worrying’.

Frank Haskew, from the ICAEW, which has not yet formally responded to the consultation, told MPs: ‘We can’t have HMRC as judge and jury on this. This power is unprecedented in the UK. These powers are extremely worrying and excessive.’

An HMRC spokesman said: ‘It is hard to see why a tiny minority of people who can pay the tax they owe, but refuse to, should enjoy an advantage over the vast majority of people who respect the rules.’
