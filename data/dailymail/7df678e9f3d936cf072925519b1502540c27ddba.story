Troubled country singer Mindy McCready is allegedly under investigation for any possible role she played in her live-in boyfriend’s shooting death, as new claims emerge that he was cheating on her and possibly threatened to leave her on the day that he died.

The latest folds in the saga surrounding the death of McCready’s boyfriend David Wilson come as the National Enquirer alleges that he had been cheating on the singer and that brought out her jealous side.

‘David had been carrying on an affair 
for many weeks before the shooting. When Mindy found out, it fuelled a 
lot of very heated fights,’ an unidentified source reportedly told the magazine.

Mourning: David Wilson, seen here with his country singer girlfriend Mindy McCready, was found with a gunshot wound on Sunday night and pronounced dead hours later

‘The tension in their household became so unbearable that David packed up and left. He returned several days later to tell Mindy that he was going to leave her for good.’

Police in Heber Springs, Arkansas, have not said that there are any suspects in the case and their initial report on the shooting said that he died of wounds sustained by a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

In all previous reports, it was never clear if Mindy was in the house at the time that her beau shot himself on Sunday January 13, but in the Enquirer article, they allege that she was actually the one who made the 911 call.

According to the magazine, she told investigators that she did not hear the gunshot because the volume on the television set was too loud and that the emergency operator even heard a man moaning in the background when she was making the call.

Scene of the sorrow: David Wilson died at his Heber Springs home in an idyllic part of Arkansas

‘There [seem to be] a lot of elements to the case that police feel simply don’t seem to add up,’ a source told The National Enquirer.

He shot himself to death at the idyllic $180,000 home in Heber Springs, Arkansas, that they shared together.

The revelations raise further questions as to why Wilson - with whom McCready had a son, Zayne, nine months - took such drastic action at a time when he appeared on the surface to be so happy.

Close friends told MailOnline that they were clueless as to what could have gone wrong with a man they knew as ‘always in good spirits’.

Custody: Mindy had been fighting for custody rights over her elder son Zander (pictured) for years and allegedly was just awarded the landmark decision

The couple were reportedly in a good mood dating back to December because the troubled singer had finally been awarded custody of her elder son, Zander.

McCready had taken her case to the Supreme Court which ruled in mid-December that she would be the sole guardian of five-year-old Zander, whom she had with her ex-husband.

‘Zander had come out of care and they were together. He was reunited with his mother. She was enjoying being a family,’ McCready’s spokesman Kat Atwood said.

‘Under the circumstances she is doing the best that she can. Her family are coming to her in Arkansas to make the final arrangements’.
