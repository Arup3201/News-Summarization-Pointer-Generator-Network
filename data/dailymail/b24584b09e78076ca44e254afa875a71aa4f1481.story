If you're a curious soul with a taste for the unusual, or just a bad hangover on a Sunday morning, one of Cleveland Street's newest cafes in Sydney's Surry Hills might have just your fix. 

Since opening its doors in January, Dr Faustus, a 1920's-feel brunch spot in a re-styled old pharmacy, has been serving an eclectic menu of 'remedies and elixirs' for the urban hipster crowd.

It's owners call themselves 'alchemists' of food & drink. 

Cereal flavoured milk and The Arnold Palmer - home made ice-tea with lemonade - are just some of the unusual 'elixirs' on offer at Dr Faustus in Sydney's Surrey Hills

Unusual elixirs on offer include bourbon piccolo lattes with a side of fried bacon, 'devilish coffees', home-made iced teas and a new take on an old favourite - the cereal milkshake.

Popular 'remedies' on the menu are the cafe's signature 'drunken' fries for a pounding hangover head and the Pulled Mushroom Bunhouse with smoked wild mushrooms and 'kaleslaw'.

The Foie gras BLTs, brussel sprout caesars and quail eggs with caviar have also proven to be hits with the locals.

Dr Faustus on Cleveland Street opened is doors as a cafe in January. Owners kept many of the original features from the shop's past life as a pharmacy, built in 1908.

The cafe takes its name from the 16th Century Robert Marlow play in which Faustus, a German scholar, dabbles in the dark arts and sells his soul to the devil in a quest for knowledge and power. 

Owner and former bartender, Adam Kane, says he was inspired by the old building with its original pharmacy cabinets to create something quirky for Surry Hills.

'I wanted to trade off the idea of the alchemist, the snake-oil salesman, the bluesman that meets the devil at the crossroads. All in some way striving to reach some higher ground, that I believe food and drink can attain,' Kane told Broadsheet Media.

One of Kane's favourite concoctions is cereal milk, something he says has become a big thing in New York, where it's used in cocktails, and to make pannacotta and ice creams.

Dr Faustus currently offers Coco Pops, Cheerios and Nutri-grain flavoured milk as part of its breakfast menu - and has plans to create many more. 

'Everyone has a favourite type of cereal,' Kane told Fairfax Media. 'We couldn't just stock one brand in the fridge.'

The cereal milk is sold as a caffeinated Coco Pop latte or sprinkled with cinnamon or dark chocolate in your choice of full cream, skim or soy milk.

Going forward, Kane says the cafe is thinking about creating doughnuts with a cereal milk glaze. 

But so far, given full-house weekends since Dr Faustus opened its doors, he thinks 'all beasts are happy'.
