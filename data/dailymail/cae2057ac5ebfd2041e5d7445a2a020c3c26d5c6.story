When Louis van Gaal leads his team out for the first time at Old Trafford against Valencia on Tuesday evening, we should receive a clear indication of the players that will form a central part of the Dutchman's plans at Old Trafford in the opening weeks of the season.

With the likes of Anderson, Nani and Marouane Fellaini already cut adrift, Sportsmail identifies five players hoping to seal a place in the starting line-up for the visit of Swansea when the Barclays Premier League kicks off this weekend.

Home bow: Louis van Gaal takes charge of Manchester United at Old Trafford for the first time on Tuesday

Warm welcome: Van Gaal has overseen a successful pre-season but much tougher challenges lie ahead

Danny Welbeck

Van Gaal's 3-5-2 system will bring a welcome end to the days where Welbeck would be expected to do a shift in the wide positions. His opportunities will now come through the middle and nobody should underestimate how important that is for the England forward.

There was credence to the reports that Welbeck was considering a move towards the end of last season. He has always been a little sensitive to the microscope being placed over his goalscoring return when defensive priorities have been emphasised so much by previous managers David Moyes and Sir Alex Ferguson. 

Welbeck recorded a good return of 11 last season but only scored three after the turn of the year. If he is to flourish centrally, Van Gaal will need to count on Welbeck to hit 15 this season. 

With Robin van Persie still returning to peak condition after his World Cup exertions and doubts surrounding the future of Javier Hernandez, an eye-catching performance on Tuesday should see Welbeck seal his place in the starting line-up on Saturday.

Ashley Young

After a truly disappointing 18 months, Young's renaissance under Van Gaal has been nothing short of remarkable. Ineffectual and frustrating under Moyes, Young has been reenergised in the left wing-back position and looks likely to now be retained by the Dutchman. 

On the evidence of this summer, most United followers will agree with that decision and that would have been unthinkable at the end of last season. 

Nonetheless, it is still expected that Luke Shaw will be the first-choice option in the position but with Van Gaal making clear his doubts over the 19-year-old's fitness just a couple of weeks ago, Young could yet have the chance to start when the Premier League returns this weekend.

Darren Fletcher

With Michael Carrick suffering a serious injury in pre-season, an opportunity has emerged in the midfield positions for Fletcher, who was outstanding in pre-season match against Real Madrid.

Finally, after a debilitating bowel disorder that - as he admitted - left him one make-or-break procedure away from retirement, Fletcher appears to be back to his best. Still only 30, a fit and dynamic Fletcher has much to offer to United and his courage has only increased his popularity among the Old Trafford support. 

The Scot only made 12 starts last season and Moyes, it is understood, would have been open to the idea of selling him if United received the right offer this summer. That would now appear unlikely under Van Gaal, with Ander Herrera the only arrival in central midfield and Fletcher demonstrating his credentials so clearly in the USA.

Back in favour: Darren Fletcher could have a key role to play in the Manchester United midfield this season

Tom Cleverley

The scapegoat for many of United's ills last season, Cleverley certainly appears more relaxed and content under the leadership of Van Gaal. The 25-year-old captained United in the States against Roma and he is determined to make it work at Old Trafford. 

At varying points, Ferguson,  Moyes, Roberto Martinez, Gary Neville, Roy Hodgson and Ryan Giggs have all seen things they admire in this player and Van Gaal, also, sees a place for Cleverley in his squad. 

He will know that he must add more goals to his game and that he must bring greater control to the United midfield. Last season, he came up a little short - but then again, who didn't in a red shirt? With Carrick injured - and Fellaini and Anderson on their way out - Cleverley must shine this season.

Shinji Kagawa

The Japanese playmaker has performed only in fits and starts in his two seasons at Old Trafford, although he would argue that he has been forced out of his favoured position behind the forwards and onto the left-wing all too often. 

Failed to score in 30 appearances under Moyes last season but Van Gaal appears to have seen something and Kagawa will act as back-up behind Juan Mata and the emerging Adnan Januzaj in the hole this season. If Mata is fit, he will start on Saturday but a classy performance from Kagawa at Old Trafford on Tuesday may cause Van Gaal a headache ahead of his first Premier League game this weekend.

Last chance? Shinji Kagawa has yet to perform at his best after two years at Old Trafford
