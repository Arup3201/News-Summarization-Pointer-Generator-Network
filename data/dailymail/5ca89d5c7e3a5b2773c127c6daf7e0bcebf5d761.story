One year ago, Pamela Doyle was busy preparing for her fairytale big day, which would be held in a stunning Scottish castle.

But with just weeks to go before her wedding, she was dumped by her fiance and lost her £2,000 deposit - all because of her weight.

At size 24, Pamela, 31, tipped the scales at a massive 17 stone. But the Glaswegian call centre worker has had the last laugh.

Not only has she lost seven stone and slimmed to a size 12, her ex has been left 'stunned' by her dramatically changed appearance.

'He ended the relationship because of my weight and the issues surrounding it,' said Pamela of her former lover  - a serving soldier who she does not want to name.  It was making him miserable.'

Devastated by the split, Pamela finally decided to do something about her dreadful diet, which included lashings of curry, 
burgers and crisps plus two litres of Irn-Bru a day.

'I was devastated but it was just the thing I needed to spur me on to lose weight,' she says. 'When I was 17 stone I had no confidence and I was very unhappy.

'I used to hide away and I wouldn't go out. I even did my shopping online because I couldn't face people.

'Now I feel amazing. I have regained my confidence and I don't think my ex could quite believe his eyes when he saw me.'

Pamela and her boyfriend first became a couple when they were 17, when she was a size 14.

She explained: 'I steadily put on weight throughout my teens and my twenties and things got gradually worse.

'On a typical day I would have macaroni cheese and chips for lunch, snack on crisps and chocolate, then have curry followed by ice cream for tea [supper].

'I was comfort eating because my boyfriend was in the forces and he was often away for long periods.

'I would eat large Big Mac meals and drink two litres of Irn-Bru a day. My weight made me feel very depressed.

'I was moody and when my boyfriend came back I would hide myself away and not come out of the bedroom.

'He kept on at me about eating healthily and he tried to help me but I was difficult to be with.

'He proposed to me in 2009. I was still about 17 stone then and I made token efforts to control my weight. I'd go to one or two classes, lose a couple of stone and then give up.'

The couple were due to wed last August at Airth Castle in Sterlingshire, Scotland.

Pamela said: 'We'd put deposits down on the venue, the band and even a piper. But last March he came to me and said he wanted to end the relationship. I have to admit I was difficult to be with and I don't blame him.

'I was absolutely devastated but it was the spur I needed to finally do something about my weight problem.'

Pamela contacted personal trainer David Wilson of Rapid-Hypno Fitness, who uses a combination of hypnosis, psychology and gym training.

David said: 'We did hypnosis to work on her mental attitude because when she came to me she was very emotional and had a lot of negative thoughts.

'We worked on that before making a start on the physical side. She has been doing interval training - 30-minute sessions five or six times a week. It involves cardio-vascular exercise - bikework and treadmill training.

'Pamela really is an inspirational example of what can be achieved. A lot of people come to me wanting to lose a lot of weight and they don't think it's possible.

'But Pamela has shown that with hard work, determination and a change of mindset from negative to positive, you can achieve great things.'

Pamela, who now weighs just under 10 and a half stone, is still in touch with her ex-boyfriend and said she has not ruled out a reconciliation.
