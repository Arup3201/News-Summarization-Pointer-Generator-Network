American journalists have been given a gentle reminder regarding the etiquette of dealing with dignitaries by a media organisation, ahead of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's royal visit next month.

The Duke and Duchess will visit New York City and Washington, DC, for three days, their first official visit to the US in three years.

According to Politico, the Senate Periodical Press Gallery yesterday emailed its members with what will be seen as a timely reminder of how journalists will be expected to behave when dealing with the royal couple.

Dress right, the British are coming: US journalists covering royal events during the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's visit next month have been ordered to dress smart for the occasion 

These include 'not taking pictures in the wrong places, not walking backwards and not being so absorbed in a phone as to run into people'.

Other media outlets have been directing their staff to the Buckingham Palace website, where a strict dress code can be found for journalists wishing to cover Royal events.

The rules state: 'Journalists wishing to cover royal engagements, whether in the United Kingdom or abroad, should comply with the dress code on formal occasions out of respect for the guests of the Queen, or any other member of the royal family.

'Smart attire for men includes the wearing of a jacket and tie, and for women a trouser or skirt suit.

'Those wearing jeans or trainers will not be admitted and casually dressed members of the media will be turned away. This also applies to technicians.'

The Royal couple will travel to New York on December 7th for a programme of events on behalf of the Royal Foundation and other charities.

The engagements include promoting sustainable conservation issues, young people's mental health and supporting disadvantaged young people.

William and Kate will arrive on the evening of the 7th December and will spend their first night in the US at a private dinner on behalf of the American Friends of the Royal Foundation.

The Foundation was set up by Princes Harry and William in 2009 and officially launched in 2011 as the main vehicle for their philanthropic activities, including the Invictus Games.

Prince William will spend the day in Washington DC on December 8th while Kate remains in New York. During his visit, the Prince will attend an anti-corruption conference at the World Bank, focusing on the transportation of illegal wildlife parts across borders.

In his absence, the Duchess will accompany the First Lady of New York City, Chirlane McCray, on a visit to a local child development centre. 

The bump is coming: This will be the first foreign visit for the Duchess since announcing her second pregnancy, but Prince George will not come with the Royal couple to the US

He will also attend a reception in New York for the Tusk Trust on the same day, before rejoining the Duchess of Cambridge to watch a basketball game.

The following day, both the Duke and Duchess will visit an inner city youth organisation, focused on social support and learning for poorer children - another key focus for the Royal Foundation.

Also on the agenda is an event celebrating the British creative talent boasted by New York's media and creative industries.

Prince William, who like Prince Charles has long been fascinated with technology, will attend an event hosted by a New York-headquartered technology company, which will bring together entrepreneurs from both the UK and the US.

The final engagement of the visit will be the University of St. Andrews 600th Anniversary Dinner at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

St Andrews was the Scottish university where the Duke and Duchess first met in 2002 after enrolling on the same History of Art degree course.

Kensington Palace said: 'The couple really are very much looking forward to all the special moments of the visit. They've been an integral part in planning it.'
