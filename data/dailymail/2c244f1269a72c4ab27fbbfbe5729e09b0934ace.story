The BBC’s iPlayer website received a record three billion requests for free online programmes last year, reigniting fears viewers will stop paying the TV licence fee.

New figures show internet viewing has risen by a third since 2012 as fans watched catch–up versions of Top Gear, Doctor Who and The Voice on computers and tablets rather than live on their TV sets.

Since viewers are only required to buy a £145.50 licence if they watch live broadcasts, they can legally avoid paying by waiting until their favourite show is available on BBC iPlayer instead.

Around half a million UK households exploit this legal loophole, prompting claims the BBC’s funding model is outmoded.

The latest official figures, released yesterday, show more than 20million people have now downloaded the BBC iPlayer app on their mobile phones, allowing them to watch shows on the go.

Some devices allow programmes to be downloaded and kept for 30 days, while most programmes can be streamed online for a week after they are first broadcast on terrestrial TV.

Last year, some programmes, such as BBC3 comedy Bad Education starring Jack Whitehall, were put online before they were shown on TV, while special mini-episodes of Sherlock and Doctor Who were only available on iPlayer.

The
 BBC’s head of TV content for iPlayer Victoria Jaye promised even more 
TV shows would be premiered online this year, further encouraging fans 
to abandon traditional viewing methods.

The
 most popular online programme in 2013 was Jeremy Clarkson’s motoring 
show Top Gear, which accounted for five of the top ten most popular 
catch-up episodes last year.

1.     Top Gear, series 19, Africa special part 1 – 3.4million

2.     Top Gear, series 19, episode 1 – 3.2million

3.     Doctor Who, 50th Anniversary special - 3.1million

4.     Bad Education, series 2, episode 1 – 2.9million

5.     Top Gear, series 19, Africa Special part 2 – 2.8million

6.     Top Gear, series 20, episode 1 – 2.6million

7.     Top Gear, series 19, episode 2, 2.6million

8.     Africa, Kalahari episode, 2.6million

9.     Doctor Who, series 7, episode 1, 2.6million

10.   Madagascar, 2.4million

An Africa special, in which he and co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond attempted to drive to the source of the Nile in three used estate cars, was the most watched online programme, with 3.4million iPlayer hits after it was shown on TV last March.

Also popular on catch-up were episodes of Doctor Who, natural history programme Africa, hit animated film Madagascar, episodes of sitcom Miranda and the blind auditions of reality show The Voice.

In December – when iPlayer received 271million programme hits – millions chose to watch the BBC’s Christmas special editions of Doctor Who, EastEnders and Mrs Brown’s Boys online rather than live on TV.

More than 40 per cent of viewers access the iPlayer website through their desktop PCs, but the number watching on portable tablet computers more than doubled to 20 per cent.

Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘The model for the licence fee is long out of date thanks to technological advances.

It’s time to reform this out of date tax so as to ease the burden it places on households while ensuring the BBC has a fair and sustainable source of funding.’
