The watchful eye of a young woman who was doing dishes has been credited with preventing a well-planned family and high school massacre in Minnesota, authorities say.

Chelsie Schellhas was standing at the sink of her home in Waseca on Tuesday night when out of the window she noticed a tall young man slip into the storage facility next door.

'He shut the door and normally we see people come here and it doesn’t take them 10 minutes to open a storage shed, so I called it in,' Schellhas told CNN.

And she was right - once police arrived, they discovered the unit was being used to make an arsenal of explosive devices, which would eventually lead them to a cache of seven guns and six bombs, along with the materials to make more.

Instinctual: Chelsie Schellahas was doing dishes at her kitchen sink when she saw would-be killer John LaDue, 17, acting suspiciously at the storage facility next to her home. She called police on instinct and her gut was right

Deadly plan: John LaDue was allegedly planning to kill his family before embarking on a massacre at Waseca High School that involved home-made bombs and guns

LaDue was allegedly making explosives in a storage unit at this facility in Waseca, Minn., but his plans to use the devices were thwarted when a nearby resident, Chelsie Schellahas, noticed him entering the unit on Tuesday night and called police

Some of the bombs were allegedly found at this playground as snow melted around Hartley Elementary School playground in Waseca, Minn, in March. John LaDue, 17, has been arrested for plotting to kill his family and massacre students at a Waseca school

John LaDue, 17, a local honor student, has allegedly admitted to an elaborate plan he had hatched to kill 'as many students as he could' as part of a personal commemoration of the Columbine High School massacre, which occurred on April 20, 1999.

Schellhas told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune the teen was cutting through her backyard when she first noticed him.

'He walked through the puddles when there was a perfectly good road he could have walked on,' Schellhas told the paper.

'It just didn’t seem right to me because we see people come and go with their trucks, and they don’t come on foot and cut through people’s back yards.'

'It was like he was blatantly trying not to be seen,' she continued. 'That’s why I thought it was odd.'

LaDue took 'some time' before opening the door, appearing to be breaking in, Schellhas explained.

Able to see into the locker, she noticed shopping bags and trash that 'didn't look right'.

He then closed it behind him, cops said, and Schellhas called 911.

Officers responding to the storage locker around 7:30 pm immediately noticed a significant amount of bombs and bomb making materials, police said.

'I thought it was odd': Chelsie Schellahas said her gut instincts told her to call police when she saw John LaDue in the storage facility next to her house on Tuesday night

Caught: John LaDue was charged with four counts of attempted murder, six counts of explosives possessions and related property damage charges

LaDue has since been charged with four counts of attempted murder, six counts of explosives possessions and related property damage charges.

He is being charged as a juvenile, said prosecutor Brenda Miller.

LaDue first planned to kill his father, mother and sister, police said.

After their slayings, the teen planned to set a fire, which would act as a diversion to tie up emergency responders as he carried out his main plot at the school.

He'd planned to set off 'numerous bombs' during the lunch hour at Waseca Junior/Senior High School, then kill the school resource officer, police said.

Then he'd unleash gunfire on students until police officers arrived, allegedly planning to let them kill him.

The teen's cache in the storage locker contained only pieces of the puzzle.

Police got a search warrant and at 10:30 p.m. arrived at LaDue's home, where he lived with his family.

Behind that door lay bombs he had finished at the storage unit, numerous guns and ammunition, police say.

LaDue had also detailed his plan in a journal.

Police allegedly found an arsenal of seven guns, along with bombs and other materials, at this house where John LaDue lived with his family in Waseca

A bomb squad removed all recovered explosives and destroyed them by controlled detonation at a local airport.

LaDue’s 
arsenal included an SKS assault-style rifle, a .22-cailber rifle and a 
Baretta handgun, according to the paper. He planned to use the .22 to 
kill his family because it makes less noise than the other firearms.

‘A great catastrophe and tragedy was averted,’ Waseca Mayor Roy Srp said.

'I’m
very disturbed by the amount of items he had,’ said Waseca Police 
captain Kris Markeson, later adding that ‘he intended to do a great 
amount of harm ... the amount of thought and preparation he put into this, it’s very, very complete.'

'It was apparently first written in the 
notebook June 24, 2013, and while the semantics of the terror plot were 
tweaked over time, the original idea remained in tact - to kill his 
family, the school liaison officer and as many students as possible,' the
 court documents revealed.

it is not known how LaDue, a minor, managed to obtain the firearms.

LaDue was described as shy and an outcast, but someone who still had friends and was not bullied.
