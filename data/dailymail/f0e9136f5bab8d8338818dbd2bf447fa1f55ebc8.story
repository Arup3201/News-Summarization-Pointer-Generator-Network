The West must not threaten Russian president Vladimir Putin, above, over a solution to the Ukrainian crisis, the Kremlin warned today; Putin is pictured above speaking before the start of the winter Olympics last week

The West must not threaten Vladimir Putin over a solution to the Ukrainian crisis, the Kremlin warned today.

The demand came as Ukraine accused Moscow of deploying new troops and military hardware to rebel-held regions. Ukraine claims 1,500 Russian troops and convoys of military hardware entered their territory over the weekend, something Russia denies.

America is considering supplying arms to Kiev, while a senior British defence official, Nick Gurr, head of international security policy, was said to today be in Kiev to discuss 'cooperation in the military sphere'.

Ukrainian officials said he was meeting defence minister Stepan Poltorak and would discuss reforms in Ukraine's defence system.

A Putin spokesman said: 'Nobody has ever talked to the president in the tone of an ultimatum, and could not do so even if they wished to.'

Putin blames the West for the current bloodshed in eastern Ukraine and shows no signs of compromise.

The EU wanted to 'tear off' ex-Soviet states and force them into an 'artificial choice' between Russia and Europe, he has claimed.

'We repeatedly warned the USA and its Western allies about the harmful consequences of their interference in Ukrainian domestic affairs but they did not listen to our opinion,' he told an Egyptian newspaper.

President Barack Obama met German Chancellor Angela Merkel today in a public display of unity despite a potential split over arming Ukrainian fighters to wage a more effective battle against Russian-backed separatists

Putin sees Ukraine as part of Russia's sphere of influence in eastern Europe. 

President Barack Obama met German Chancellor Angela Merkel today in a public display of unity despite a potential split over arming Ukrainian fighters to wage a more effective battle against Russian-backed separatists.

That was the unstated point of the White House meeting, where Ms Merkel was to brief Mr Obama on upcoming talks aimed at reviving a peace plan for besieged Ukraine.

At issue is not only Putin's support for the separatists but the revival of the Soviet Cold War strategy of trying to create a critical division between the U.S. and its NATO allies, Germany in particular.

Ms Merkel and French President Francois Hollande met with Ukrainian leaders and Putin last week and have announced a new summit meeting for Wednesday in Minsk. French and German leaders are to sit down with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Putin in an attempt to breathe life into a much-violated September peace plan. The U.S. will not be at the table.

That meeting in the Belarusian capital takes place with Ms Merkel and Mr Hollande deeply opposed to arming Ukraine in its bid to push back the separatists that NATO and the U.S. insist are being armed by Russia, which also has troops fighting in the eastern Ukraine. 

The White House has let it be known that Mr Obama, who had resisted calls to send arms, was now considering doing just that. Opponents of arming Kiev believe that could open a proxy war between Washington and Moscow. Merkel and Hollande insist the only way to end the conflict is through diplomacy. 

Former U.S. presidential candidate John McCain warned Ukrainians 'are being slaughtered, and we're sending them blankets and meals.

'Blankets don't do well against Russian tanks.'

More than 5,300 people have been killed since fighting began in April, according to a U.N. tally; the bloodshed has markedly increased over the past two weeks; a pro-Russian separatist fires a machine gun towards the eastern Ukrainian city of Debaltseve, in the Donetsk region, last month 

The EU has vowed to put new sanctions against Russia on hold ahead of last ditch talks to end the conflict.

On the table is a plan to create a demilitarised zone of between 30 and 45 miles around the current frontline. 

At the Munich Security Conference over the weekend, Vice President Joe Biden stopped short of explicitly addressing possible arms deliveries.

He said: 'We will continue to provide Ukraine with security assistance not to encourage war, but to allow Ukraine to defend itself.'
