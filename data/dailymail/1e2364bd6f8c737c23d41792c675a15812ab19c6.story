Gary Neville has urged Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal to stick with playing four at the back for the rest of the season.

The Red Devils started with three central defenders for Saturday's Barclays Premier League win at QPR, but it was only once they switch to a flat back-four that Marouane Fellaini and James Wilson struck to seal the points.

Fans are desperate for the Dutchman to ditch his more favoured 3-5-2 formation, and former United full-back agrees with the Old Trafford faithful.

He told Monday Night Football: 'Louis van Gaal wants them to recycle the ball and switch the play. I'm not a fan of 3-5-2 because the centre-backs are the free men and they become the safe option.

'They play out from the back but the tempo is too slow. Far too often they are keeping possession and passing it backwards. 

'They've become quite predictable in the past few weeks. Manchester United looked far more dangerous on Saturday when they changed the system.

'Fans want them to go 2-0 up and then keep possession rather than fight for goals near the end.' 

Van Gaal has been keen to strengthen his options at back by looking at Borussia Dortmund's Mats Hummels during the January transfer window.

Yet the 26-year-old German international could be prepared to stay in the Bundesliga, even if Dortmund fail to qualify for the Champions League.

Qualification to be among Europe's elite looks extremely unlikely given they are 12 points behind fourth place, but Hummels appears prepared to wait it out.

Speaking to Die Welt, Hummels said: 'We have worked to the maximum in every game but a few times but opponents were better than us. We have to get up and move up the ranks as soon as possible.

'Would I play in Dortmund without the Champions League? I do not think qualification for the Champions League will be the only requirement to be happy.'
