A dance teacher who collapsed and died only hours after being sent home from hospital might have been saved if doctors had tested her more thoroughly, an inquest has heard.

Nadia Wearn, 31, had been to hospital to complain of pains down her left arm, chest and back, but was advised they were probably due to how she held her baby daughter, the hearing was told.

She was told to take painkillers but, less than three hours later, she collapsed at her home in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, in front of her mother.

Advised to take painkillers : Nadia Wearn, pictured with husband Jason, died only hours after visiting hospital

The inquest, held at South Shields Register Office, heard that Mrs Wearn visited South Tyneside District Hospital on June 1 last year.

She was sent away after being told the pains were down to the way she was holding her 13-week-old daughter Ava.

Mrs Wearn’s mum Pauline, who has 40 years' nursing experience, broke down in tears at the inquest as she described how her daughter collapsed.

'Nadia was sitting on the sofa and then she just leaned forward and said "faint",' she said.

'I told her to sit back and I shouted to (Mrs Wearn's husband) Jason to get the baby and told him to call an ambulance.

'I pulled her on to the floor. There was no pulse. I started CPR, but there was just nothing.

'The ambulance seemed to take ages to arrive. Her lips were blue, I just held her on the floor, kept doing CPR.

'I checked her pulse and there was nothing. She had gone.'

Home Office pathologist Stuart Hamilton, who conducted a post-mortem on Mrs Wearn's body, found the cause of death to be 'unascertained'.

Coroner Terence Carney was told that Mrs Wearn had been assessed as a minor injury patient, and no Electrocardiography (ECG) or blood tests had been carried out to try to find out the cause of her pain.

When asked why, Dr Soni Shrestha, who examined Mrs Wearn, replied: 'All her findings were normal.'

The doctor added: 'There was no indication for blood tests so I did not feel I had to do the blood tests.

'If she had been presenting cardiac symptoms like a crushing chest pain and pain to her left side, if she was a heavy drinker or smoker, then I would have had a think about it.

'She did not appear anxious, not to me. All her vitals were fine.'

Dr Shrestha told the inquest that she had told Mrs Wearn that if the symptoms worsened to come back to accident and emergency.

Dr Peter Goode, a specialist consultant at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary, said that in his opinion Mrs Wearn ‘should have’ had an ECG and blood tests.

He added: 'The question remains for me whether first of all should there have been a different course of action and, if a different course of action had been followed, could this have reduced or prevented her death?

'She should have had a chest x-ray, an ECG and blood tests.

'If those investigations had been done, could this have presented this lady's death or reduced the risk?

'If they had been abnormal in some way, she would have been admitted to hospital.

'The difficulty we have is we don’t have a subsequent diagnosis from the post-mortem.'

Dr Goode said that, had the cause of the collapse been due to a blood clot, the outcome would have been the same.

But he added: 'If it was a sudden cardiac change, the chances of survival would have been better in hospital.'

The inquest heard that Mrs Wearn, who had suffered from a hereditary blood disorder, was readmitted to hospital.

Medics tried to save her by giving her thrombolysis treatment, but she was pronounced dead an hour later.

The inquest continues.
