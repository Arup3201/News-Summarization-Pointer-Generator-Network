This is the moment a police van got into a sticky situation - after getting trapped between two buildings in a narrow road.

The vehicle fell victim to the tiny lane in Looe, Cornwall, and became firmly wedged for around 20 minutes.

Local resident Joanna Bond, 28, took the snap on her iPhone and it quickly became a hit on Facebook.

She said: 'I was cooking dinner at around 6.30pm when I saw two police officers staring up the road in bewilderment.

'I took a look and saw with amusement that their police van had become stuck, wedged between the wall of the Fishermans Arms and Tower House.

'Stuff like this has happened before but this time I couldn't miss the opportunity so decided to take a picture using my iPhone as quick as possible without being seen.

'I found it quite funny as it was the police, but luckily for them though, they seemed to have moved it after around 20 minutes.'

The landlord of The Fisherman's Arms, where the van got stuck, said it was common for vehicles to get wedged there.

Landlord Mick Lee, who wasn't there when the van got stuck last Saturday, said: 'They are not the first to get stuck, and I am sure they won't be the last.

'People use their sat navs and it takes them down the hill where they just get stuck.

'It does annoy me a little bit because when it happens it takes off the guttering on the pub which I have to repair.

'I am sure it will happen again, but I will admit it was slightly strange to see a police vehicle there.

'I guess they were just on their way to a job and went the wrong way as everyone else seems to do.'
