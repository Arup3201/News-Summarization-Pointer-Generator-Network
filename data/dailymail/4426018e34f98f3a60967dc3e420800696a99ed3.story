For years, customers at Fat Smitty's hamburger restaurant have stuck personalised dollar bills to the eatery's walls and ceiling.

Now the owner of the landmark diner - which sits on Highway 101 in Discovery Bay, Washington - has finally taken down the vast collection of banknotes and donated the cash to charity.

Carl 'Fat Smitty' Schmidt struggled over his decision to remove the thousands of dollar bills that have slowly accumulated in his restaurant over the last quarter of a century.

But on Saturday, he enlisted Boy Scouts and Cub Scouts to take down the money ahead of a refurbishment.

After a lengthy count, it turns out he had amassed $10,316 in $1 bills.

Mr Schmidt, a retired marine, said he is giving all but $3,000 to a local Boy Scouts project. Over the years, Boy Scouts regularly stopped at Fat Smitty's on the way home from camping trips.

The rest of the money will go to St Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Mr Schmidt's connection to that hospital was not immediately known.

Casey Carson, who is Mr Schmidt's nephew and now manages Fat Smitty's, told the KitsapSun.com: 'It is hard to take all this down. It makes it easier to know that the money is going to charity, and hopefully people will put it back up again.'

The Fat Smitty's tradition began in 1985 when a travelling salesman wrote his name on a single dollar bill and tacked it to the wall.

Over the course of the next 27 years, more than 10,000 customers followed his lead, writing messages on their own dollar bills.

Mr Schmidt was unable to find the salesman's original banknote during Saturday's clean-up.

His nephew had estimated there would be $6,000 in cash stuck to the restaurant's walls and ceiling - his guess ended up more than $4,000 short of the final total.

The building that houses Fat Smitty's has operated as a restaurant since the 1940s.

Mr Schmidt took it over in 1983 and finally passed on the reins to Mr Carson two years ago.

Mr Carson said: 'Four generations of families have come here to eat and four generations have worked here.

'I got married here in 1994. There is so much history that you don't really want to change anything.'

A newly decorated Fat Smitty's is scheduled to reopen in March when Mr Carson hopes customers will continue to tack dollar bills to its walls.
