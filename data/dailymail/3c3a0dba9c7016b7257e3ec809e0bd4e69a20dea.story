Gus Poyet is confident Connor Wickham is playing better now than when his goals helped spark Sunderland's remarkable recovery last season.

The 21-year-old striker scored five times in three  Premier League appearances at the end of the last campaign to help drag the Black Cats back from the brink of relegation.

Poyet, who recalled the former Ipswich frontman from a loan spell at Leeds to hand him his big chance, has installed Wickham as his first-choice lone striker this time around and although he is yet to open his league account, the manager is convinced he is offering even more to the team.

The Uruguayan said: 'I actually think he is playing better than he did last year, but he is scoring fewer goals.

'It's about finding a balance. We don't want him to be the best player on the pitch every week without scoring, but nor do we want him to be awful and scoring a goal every now and then.

'He needs to find the balance between playing well and scoring - and he will get there.

'We need to keep on creating chances for him and it is only when we stop creating chances that he will have a problem.

'There's a big difference between a striker who doesn't score because his team is not creating chances, and one who has chances but is missing them.'

Wickham is not alone in enduring a barren spell in front of goal with none of Poyet's three main frontmen - Scotland international Steven Fletcher and United States counterpart Jozy Altidore are the others - having yet registered this season.

But as he heads into Saturday's home clash with Stoke, which will provide Sunderland with their latest attempt to secure a first Premier League win of the season, Poyet is happy that the youngster has improved significantly as a player during their time together.

The 46-year-old said: 'He is holding the ball the ball up better now, and I think that's due to the way we train and the fact that he knows just what we want him to do.

'It's not just about doing it in games, it's also about taking care of the ball every day in training, and he does that.

'He has been impressive and he has been a massive player for us. I enjoy watching him and I just want to start seeing him put the ball in the net.'
