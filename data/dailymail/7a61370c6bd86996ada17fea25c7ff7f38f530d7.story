Warning: Billionaire Warren Buffett, left, pictured today at a Wall Street mogul conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, said congressional Republicans were being reckless by refusing to raise the debt ceiling

Legendary investor Warren Buffett has accused Republican congressmen of playing ‘Russian roulette’ and trying to ‘blow America’s brains out’ with their defiance on debt.

The self-made billionaire accused the GOP-controlled House of Representatives of being reckless by refusing to raise the government borrowing limit beyond $14.3trillion.

The Treasury has warned it will run out of money to pay all of the country's bills if the ceiling is not increased by August 2, risking the first-ever U.S. debt default and a second recession.

And once against last night, talks 
fell apart between President Barack Obama and Republican congressmen led
by House Speaker John Boehner.

Today
Mr Buffett, 80, hit out by claiming the GOP strategy was like a deadly game 
of chance involving passing around a six-chamber revolver loaded with a 
single bullet.

‘Five times 
out of six to raise the debt limit might not be dangerous, but the sixth
time could have catastrophic consequences,’ he said at a Wall Street 
mogul conference in Sun Valley, Idaho.

He
added that Republican were ‘trying to use the incentive now that we're 
going to blow your brains out, America, in terms of your debt worthiness
over time.’

‘You're 
playing with fire when you don't need to play with fire,’ he also said, 
adding: ‘We raised the debt ceiling seven times during the Bush 
Administration,’

The U.S. ran into its $14.29 trillion debt ceiling on May 16, but has since used spending and accounting adjustments, as well as higher-than-expected tax receipts, to continue operating without impact on government obligations.

But by August 2, the government will have to begin withholding payments - to bond holders, civil servants, pensioners or contractors - if lawmakers do not raise the ceiling.

Mr Obama yesterday admitted that Democrats and Republicans are still far apart on breaking a budget deadlock and said negotiators will work through the weekend for a deal to avoid a default.

The president and congressional leaders are aiming for at least $3trillion and possibly more than $4trillion in budget savings.

The meeting dwelt only with the size of a deal, not policy specifics. A Sunday meeting is to tackle the more difficult question of how those savings can be achieved.

Warren Buffett has donated nearly $2billion more to charity as part of his plans to steadily donate 99 per cent of his wealth.

The billionaire has so far given away $11billion but, incredibly, that still leaves him as the world's third richest man.

The most recent Forbes Rich List in March put his wealth at $50billion, well ahead of Bernard Arnault, the Frenchman behind Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy and worth $41bn.

His latest giveaway was via 23.31million class B shares of his insurance and investment company Berkshire Hathaway worth $1.79billion.

Of these, the vast majority - around 19million - went to the Gates Foundation.

Mr Buffett also donated smaller sums to four family charities, including the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for Buffett's late first wife, and foundations for their children Howard, Peter and Susan.

Buffett, who in 2006 married his second wife Astrid, pictured above, has previously said that he is applying his successful investment philosophy of through research to his charity giving and has picked out Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft.

He believes Gates, the world's second richest man, has developed the most cost effective ways of making a difference.

Gates, a Berkshire director, created the Gates Foundation with his wife Melinda to address education, health and poverty problems.

The foundation employs 927 people, spent $2.6billion last year, and has a $37.1billion endowment.

Buffett's donations stand at $9.5billion so far to Gates' organisation.

Buffett is arguably the greatest investor of his era. He has built his fortune with a long-term strategy of buy-and-hold, backing sure but steady businesses such as Coca-Cola and Gillette and ignoring investment fades such as the dotcom boom.

He also has a knack for that cliche of buy low-sell high, piling into the stock market at the lowest ebb during the banking crisis in October 2008.

‘He has been famously quoted as saying investors should 'be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.'

The U.S. deficit is expected to be $1.4 trillion this year.

But
as Obama strives for a deficit reduction deal that would clear the way 
for Congress to increase the $14.3trillion cap on government borrowing 
by the deadline of August 2 he faces a possible rebellion on the Left of
his party.

The top 
Democrat in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, expressed 
concerns that cuts would be made to popular entitlement programs like 
Social Security and Medicare

Pelosi, who was speaker of the House until Democrats lost control last November, said she feared the poor and elderly would bear the brunt of budget-cutting.

‘Do not consider Social Security a piggy bank for giving tax cuts to the wealthiest people in our country,’ she said.

‘We are not going to balance the budget on the backs of seniors, women and people with disabilities.’

Mr Obama and U.S. lawmakers are aiming for an agreement that will cut government spending, possibly raise taxes, and restore some semblance of order to U.S. fiscal policy.

Briefing reporters after 90 minutes of talks with congressional leaders, Obama said both sides still were far apart and that staff negotiators will work through the weekend to find each side's bottom line.

He said he will have another round of talks with top Democrats and Republicans on Sunday, hoping to begin ‘the hard bargaining that's necessary to get a deal done.’

‘Everybody acknowledged that there's going to be pain involved politically on all sides but our biggest obligation is to make sure that we are doing the right thing,’ he said.

Mr Boehner told Republicans before meeting Obama that they should know by the end of the week whether a big agreement is possible.

‘He said it was maybe 50-50,’ a Republican Party aide said. ‘Whether or not it happens is really dependent on whether they (Democrats) continue to insist on tax hikes.’

Normally a routine vote, the debt ceiling has been embroiled in partisan politics, with Republicans seeking to impose deep spending cuts to reduce the budget deficit, which opinion polls show is a major worry for many Americans.

Mr Obama, seeking to avoid angering his liberal base ahead of his 2012 re-election bid, wants tax increases on the wealthy to lessen the pain of spending cuts.

‘I want to emphasize that nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to and the parties are still far apart on a wide range of issues,’ Obama said.

Mr Boehner said comprehensive tax reform is on the table and that changes are needed in benefit programs for the poor and elderly to ensure their long-term viability.

‘We believe that comprehensive tax reform, both on the corporate side and the personal side, will make America more competitive, help create jobs in our country, and is something that is under discussion,’ Boehner said.

Both sides have long sought a tax overhaul but have never agreed on how to carry it out. Democrats want to eliminate many tax breaks while Republicans generally want lower tax rates.

Boehner's top deputy in the House, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, signalled the possibility of a compromise on Wednesday by saying Republicans could support ending some of the tax breaks that Democrats have proposed in return for tax cuts elsewhere.

America’s trade deficit narrowed slightly over the past year – but the gap between imports and exports remains by far the biggest in the world, new figures revealed today.

CIA research showed the U.S. continued to rank last among all nations in the world when it comes to what economists call its current account balance.

The study showed that last year Americans bought $561billion more worth of goods from abroad than overseas buyers paid for American-made products.

The gap shrank by $8billion since 2009 – but it still was still $494billion more in the red than its closest rival Spain as the bottom of the current account balance table.

This is despite the dollar losing 14% of its value on international currency markers – which should help U.S. manufactures sell more goods abroad.

By comparison, China, which came first has a trade surplus of $272.5billion.
