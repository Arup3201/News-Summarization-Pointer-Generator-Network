A clock collector was eagerly awaiting the delivery of an antique cuckoo timepiece from Pennsylvania, tracking each step of its progress toward his Hollywood home and counting down the minutes before he could hang it in his above his mantle.

But much to his horror, footage from security cameras Michael Oreb installed showed an impatient U.S. postal worker briefly checking the gate, and then hurling it over the fence into Mr Oreb’s front yard.

This comes a month after a string of delivery men came under fire for carelessly handling packages, and amidst dire times for the United States Postal Service.

Deliver and run: ...and speeds off after throwing the parcel over the gate

Mr Oreb, who had installed security cameras only a week ago, witnessed the moment the postal worker threw his precious package over the gate, apparently because he couldn’t get it open after one go.

‘I looked and he pulled up, threw it (the box) over the fence, and then got in the van and drove off,’ he told NBC Los Angeles. 

Though Mr Oreb immediately went out to confront the postal worker, the delivery man had already sped off.

Afraid to look: The box was thrown high over the fence and, despite the bubble wrap, suffered some damage

He told the website that he knew his antique clock was going to be damaged based on the way it was thrown. Upon inspection, the chains were broken, the second hand was bent and loose, and there could be more damage still.

Mr Oreb said every generation in his family has owned a German Black Forest cuckoo clock, and he was looking forward to continuing the legacy.

He decided to call and complain to USPS and said within ten minutes of phoning in, a representative was at his door.

Though the representative offered to take the clock for repairs, Mr Oreb wanted to hang onto it. He said: ‘I will take it in and find me a repairman who works on antique clocks and have them repair it and I’ll send them the bill.’

In response to the video showing the careless employee, USPS released a statement saying they were ‘dismayed’ to see the video.

They said: ‘That does not represent the kind of service we strive to provide our customers,’ adding the incident is currently under investigation so they can take ‘appropriate actions’ regarding the clock-thrower.

Mr Oreb told NBC Los Angeles that he doesn’t think the man should lose his job. ‘I think he should be reprimanded, maybe put through some more training and stuff like that, ‘cause you never know what’s inside the packages when you see them.’

Going viral: The footage of the apathetic deliveryman became an internet sensation and even sparked a parody by Conan O'Brien

The cameras, he said, were for his wife’s peace of mind. They have only been living in their northern Hollywood home for seven months, and she felt safer knowing things were being monitored. 

The bad image comes at a time when the Postal Service needs all the good news it can get. The service has lost over $25billion since the 2006 fiscal year, forecasting a dismal $14billion loss in 2012.

It is set to close up to 250 of nearly 500 mail processing centres as early as March and lower delivery standards if $20billion isn’t cut.
