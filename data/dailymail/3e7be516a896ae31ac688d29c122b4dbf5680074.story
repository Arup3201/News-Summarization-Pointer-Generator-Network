As many rushed to check their  open their presents this morning, one  squirrel was checking his own festive stocking to see what  he had been left this Christmas.

The rodent had been left the treat by nature lover Sue Perring who hung it on the bird feeder at her home in Purbrook, Hampshire.

And once the curious grey squirrel spies the goodies, the resourceful rodent grapples with the swinging stocking until it finally manages to get his head inside to get his present... juicy nuts covered in peanut butter.

These hilarious pictures show the animal as he carefully peaks inside the stocking. But when it spots the secret stash, the rodent almost disappears within the stocking trying to reach the nuts.

All that can be seen is two legs, a fluffy tail and the red Christmas stocking.

But eventually it emerges victorious with its prize.

Tax consultant Sue, 39, who feeds the birds and squirrels all year round, said: 'I thought I would have a bit of fun with the pesky little creatures by hiding some special treats of walnuts and hazel nuts coated with peanut butter in a stocking on the bird pole.'

'They seemed to get excited just like kids at Christmas and it only took them a few minutes to get inside and empty their sack

'But it has been well worth the extra cost of a special Christmas treat, I have been roaring with laughter watching their antics. It has certainly brightened up my Christmas.

But they are too far down so it next sticks his arms in to reach the bottom of the stocking

The squirrel seems to go nuts for his Christmas present but is still too far away from the bottom of the bag to reach it

Eventually it is forced to let go of the bird feeder and all that can be seen is its legs and bush tail

Worth it in the end: The squirrel enjoys his hard won walnut prize

Tax consultant Sue, 39, said watching the squirrel's acrobatic attempts had brightened up her Christmas
