Hull have made Australian winger or centre Steve Michaels their fourth recruit for 2015 after the 27-year-old signed a one-year deal, with an option of a second season at the KC Stadium.

The Airlie Birds say the former Brisbane Broncos three-quarter, who has spent the four years with Gold Coast Titans, was recommended to them by former Australia and Brisbane coach Wayne Bennett.

'We are really pleased to get Steve's signature,' Hull coach Lee Radford said. 'He will undoubtedly add some speed and competition to our backline for 2015.

Competitive: Hull coach Lee Radford says he is delighted to have signed 'competitor' Michaels

'Steve has played over 120 NRL first grade games for both the Titans and the Broncos and is still only 27.

'Everyone I've spoken to regarding his personality have said the same, that he is a competitor, which is music to my ears.

'He's both comfortable playing at centre and on the wing so we're hoping the competition for places will bring the best out of our squad and will hopefully ensure everyone is working to their maximum potential.

Potential: Despite only being 27, Michaels has already racked up over 100 appearances in the NRL

'In the off season no places are guaranteed any more, I think that hasn't been the case over the last couple of years.'

Michaels has made only one appearance for the Titans this year after spending most of it on compassionate leave and is keen to kick-start his career.

'I'm rapped to come over to Hull,' said Michaels, who is following his Titans team-mate Mark Minichiello to the KC Stadium.

'I'm excited about the move. I've heard good things about the fanatical fans and the proud history of the club. It's a big challenge for me.

'I've always dreamed of coming over to the UK. It's the right time now for me but I've still got plenty of footy left in me. I'm still only 27 and I'm looking to bring some of my best footy to the UK.'

Dream come true: Michaels said he has always dreamed of playing in Britain and hopes to bring his best form
