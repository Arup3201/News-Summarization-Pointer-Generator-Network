So there will be no title decided in January. Innate caution won the day over decisive risk taking. In short, the spectacle did not fit the billing. Not even the return of Frank Lampard to Stamford Bridge for the final 15 minutes of the game — the reaction was generally, though not exclusively, warm — could inject the necessary drama or create the fantastic finale.

Chelsea and Manchester City both live to fight another day. The winter slog continues and the warm spring of title celebrations still seems some way off. In the end, Manuel Pellegrini had more to lose, though it was his side which created the better chances and it was they who sought the winner in those final anxious minutes.

Jose Mourinho was, of course, content. ‘What we have, we hold,’ might well be his mantra and a five-point lead going into February will suit just fine. The statistics will show they recorded just three shots, their lowest at home since 2003-04 and none in the second half. All will be forgiven if the title returns.

Mourinho is still not talking to the press, but we didn’t need his words to confirm what his intentions are in the coming months. There will be no rash dash for the line. When he can, he will entertain; when he is challenged, he will revert to type.

For Pellegrini the only victory he could claim was moral. ‘I think both teams have a clear style of play,’ he said. ‘Everyone wants to play in the way they think is better.

‘You analyse the style of Chelsea and I analyse the style of my team. I’m very proud of the way we played away against the leaders, where normally Chelsea wins.

‘We tried to win the game from the first minute, I’m very proud about that. And I think we created the chances, especially in the second half, to deserve more than the three points. I’m not happy about a point but I’m happy about the performance.’

He would not be drawn into a philosophical discussion of Mourinho’s football. ‘I’m not saying we’re more attacking,’ he added. ‘I’m saying both teams have a clear style.’ But that is not strictly true. Chelsea have scored 52 goals this season. When they wish to attack, they can; Saturday was not such an occasion.

Nevertheless it left Pellegrini convinced he can still win the League. ‘I said before the game that it was very important but not the final so we still have time to recover those five points. And if we continue the way we did today it will be easier.’

It wasn’t that the football was bad, though the individual errors which characterised the first half will have embarrassed some stellar reputations, Vincent Kompany and Thibaut Courtois among them. For much of the game the problem was both sides were good, just not in the way that excites you and grabs your senses. There was much for coaches to admire in midfield: solidity, tracking back, good team shape. There was a wild moment towards the end, when James Milner swept a shot across goal, when you could believe that a dramatic conclusion was imminent. Yet chances were few, the Milner moment notable for its rarity rather than its clear-cut nature.

The opening exchanges set the tone: tetchy and tight. When the chances and goals came, it was individual errors, calamitous ones from seasoned pros, which were to blame.

It started on 24 minutes, when Branislav Ivanovic lost possession to Milner, a mistake which required Courtois to parry a shot from Sergio Aguero. Then it was Kompany losing out to Loic Remy, who crossed for Oscar, whose shot forced a Joe Hart save.

On 32 minutes, Chelsea, busy appealing for a penalty, were caught out by a long ball which saw John Terry slip and Aguero break clear. The Argentinian should have scored but pulled the ball wide.

And on 42 minutes Chelsea would prise City open with a quite delightful lofted ball from Ivanovic which found Eden Hazard in space on the far left. The Belgian delivered an exquisite first-time volleyed cross but for some reason Kompany, perhaps fearful of turning it into his net, appeared half-hearted as he slid in to block. As such, he let the ball through to Remy, who had the simplest task in turning it in. Kompany punched the ground in frustration, acknowledging his error.

From such positions Mourinho’s team rarely surrender. Yet three minutes later they had. This time it was Courtois who had the aberration, flapping at a Jesus Navas cross. Perhaps he was distracted by Milner, but the ball fell to Aguero, who shot and saw David Silva turn his strike into the net.

Thereafter, the game reverted to type. The highlight of the day was referee Mark Clattenburg giving Mourinho the kind of look primary school teachers reserve for their naughtiest pupils as the Chelsea manager protested another decision.

City sat in Chelsea’s half in the second half without threatening much. There was a Fernandinho header into the ground which bounced upwards, requiring Courtois to tip the ball over on 56 minutes and a shot on 68 minutes from the Brazilian but Courtois collected that easily enough.

The principal excitement came when Lampard returned, trotting on to a mixed reception with 15 minutes to go. Even he could not produce a denouement on such an auspicious occasion and perhaps because of that he was greeted warmly from all around the ground when the final whistle went. For Lampard alone it was a day not to forget.
