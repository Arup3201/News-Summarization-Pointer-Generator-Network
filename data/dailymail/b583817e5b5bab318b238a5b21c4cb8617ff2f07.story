Pope Francis today lay prostrate in the centre of St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican to commemorate Jesus' death by crucifixion.

During the 'Passion of the Lord' service in the Vatican, Pope Francis heard from the Vatican's official preacher who condemned huge salaries claiming people were cursed by the 'hunger for gold.

Fr Raniero Cantalamessa, who is the 'preacher of the pontifical household' used the story of Judas and the 30 pieces of silver to criticise modern society's obsession with status.

Good Friday is the only day in the Roman Catholic calendar where no mass is said, instead the Passion of the Christ is celebrated

The congregation attending the Celebration of the Lord's Passion on Good Friday heard that large executive salaries were similar to Judas accepting the 30 pieces of silver to betray Jesus

The marathon service which tells the story of Jesus' crucifixion and death is one of the only times in the year when the Pope listens while another cleric preaches.Â 

According to Reuters, Fr Catalamessa told worshipers: 'Behind every evil in our society is money, or at least in part.

'The financial crisis that the world has gone through and that this country (Italy) is still going through - is it not in large part due to the cursed hunger for gold?' he said.

He added: 'Is it not also a scandal that some people earn salaries and collect pensions that are sometimes 100 times higher than those of the people who work for them and that they raise their voices to object when a proposal is put forward to reduce their salary for the sake of greater social justice?'

Since his election, Pope Francis has returned to inequity in society and the system of huge financial bonuses for senior executives.

Pope Francis will later lead a candlelight 'Way of the Cross' procession around the colosseum in Rome.

Tomorrow, he will say mass in St Peter's Basilica before delivering his 'Urbi et Orbi' (to the city and the world) message to the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics.

Later this month, Pope Francis will canonise Pope John Paul II and Pope John XXIII. It is the first time that two former popes will be made saints on the same day.
