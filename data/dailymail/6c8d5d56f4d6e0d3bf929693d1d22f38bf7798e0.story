The latest specialist equipment from the Gemini Observatory in Chile has used infrared imaging to capture striking images of the Swan Nebula situated around 6,000 light years from Earth.

The second-generation FLAMINGOS-2 camera has also snapped unique high-resolution images from the heart of a spiral galaxy as well as a ring of star formation.

FLAMINGOS-2 is spectroscopic, which means it has been designed to specifically study and record matter and radiation energy in space.

This FLAMINGOS-2 image shows part of the Swan Nebula, called M17, situated around 5,200 light years from Earth. It shows ultraviolet radiation streaming from young hot stars that forms a region of dust and gas. M17 is found in the constellation Sagittarius and is one of the biggest star-forming region's in the local galaxy

The Gemini Observatory is an astronomical observatory made up of two 8.19-metre telescopes at sites in Hawaii and Chile.

Together, the twin telescopes provide almost complete coverage of both the northern and southern skies.

One telescope, called Gemini North, is located on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano.

This location was picked because it has a stable, dry, and rarely cloudy atmosphere above the 4,200-metre-high dormant volcano.

The other telescope, Gemini South, is located at around 2,700 metres high on a mountain in the Chilean Andes called Cerro Pachon.

There are only two small regions neither telescope can capture near the celestial poles: Gemini North cannot point north of declination +89 degrees which Gemini South can't point south of -89 degrees.

After significant redesign and 
rebuilds on the Gemini South telescope, 
FLAMINGOS-2 is taking images as part of various commissioning phases with the hope it will be sent onto missions exploring the most distant and energetic explosions in our universe.

The instrument includes an extreme sensitivity to infrared (heat) radiation from the 
universe, high-resolution wide-field imaging and a combination of 
spectroscopic capabilities.

FLAMINGOS-2 is the second-generation infrared instrument to be built by the team at the Gemini South observatory.

The first, called FLAMINGOS I, suffered damage to its 
lens when it cracked during a planned final commissioning 
in early 2012.

This was caused by temperature changes that occurred as the area around the lens switched masks in order to capture multiple spectroscopic images.

The second-generation instrument has had design modifications that significantly reduces the risk of these temperature changes to the lens's integrity and functionality.

FLAMINGOS-2 will continue to be tested and will carry out more commissioning phases before being made available to astronomers later this year.

'It's already one of our most requested instruments at the Gemini telescopes,' said Nancy Levenson, Gemini's Deputy Director and Head of Science.

'We see a long and productive life ahead for FLAMINGOS-2 once astronomers really start using it later this year.'

'It has not been an easy journey,' added Percy Gomez Gemini's FLAMINGOS-2 Instrument Scientist, but thanks to the dedicated work of Gemini engineers and scientists very soon astronomers will be able to use a reliable and robust instrument.'

Work still remains on some of the instrument's spectroscopic features, as well as refining imaging at the edge of its large field of view.

Kevin Stevenson of the University of Chicago already has plans to use FLAMINGOS-2 later this year to study the exoplanet WASP-18b.

This exoplanet is being 
strongly heated by its ultra-nearby host star and according to 
Stevenson, 'it's even hotter than some of the coolest, low-mass stars 
known.'

Stevenson and his team hope to 
determine the abundances of water vapor and methane when the planet is 
eclipsed by its host star.

NGC 6300, pictured, is a spiral galaxy in the constellation of Ara. This image, taken by FLAMINGOS-2, shows the galaxy's arm structure forming a ring of star formation. The galaxy's bar also has a vein of dust that almost obscures its bright nucleus in the centre

'Our plan is to compare the system's light immediately before and during an eclipse to measure the contribution from the planet.

'When we do this over several parts of the infrared part of the light spectrum, we can piece together the planet's spectrum and learn about its temperature and composition.'

Once the instrument has finished testing an adaptive optics (AO) feed for extremely high-resolution imaging from GeMS (Gemini Multi-conjugate adaptive optics System) may be added.

This technology is capable of removing atmospheric distortion - or blurriness - when taking pictures of space, making images much clearer.

It is expected that this system will be fully integrated in 2014 with imaging and long-slit spectroscopy available now.

The next round of observations with FLAMINGOS-2 are set to begin on 1st September.

FLAMINGOS-2's latest commissioning phase captured this image of spiral galaxy NGC 7582. It is the brightest member of the Grus Quartet of galaxies, situated around 60 million light years away. Plans are to make the instrument available to astronomers later this year
