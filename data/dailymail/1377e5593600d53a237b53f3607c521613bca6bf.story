Hero: A French woman's life was saved when her German Shepherd dog saved her from shooting herself (file picture)

A woman who is said to have been trying to kill herself has been saved by her dog as it jumped on her when she tried to shoot herself.

Police in France have said that the 63-year-old woman had intended to take her own life in the garden of her home in south east France yesterday.

She is said to have walked into the garden with a rifle and fired several test shots to ensure that the gun was working.

She then turned the gun on herself and was about to pull the trigger.

But she was saved when her pet German Shepherd jumped on her and moved the gun so that she missed her shot.

The woman suffered minor injuries in the incident, say police.

A police officer told Le Figaro: 'At the moment she pulled the trigger, her dog jumped on her and diverted the shot.'

He added that the animal 'probably sensed things and knocked into her to save her'.

The woman suffered a chest wound but was found conscious by her husband.

She was taken to a nearby hospital but her injuries are not said to be life-threatening.

According to the police source, the dog has been left shaken by his owner's actions.

German Shepherd dogs are bred specifically for their intelligence and are said to interpret instructions and situations quicker than other large breeds.

They are said to be fiercely protective of their owners and territory.

The dogs heroics come just days after a stray dog was credited with saving the life of a three-year-old girl who went missing on freezing marshland in Poland.

The youngster went missing in a forest close to Pierzwit overnight in freezing temperatures.

But she was found the next morning safe and well with the dog, called Czarve, having cuddled up to her all night to keep her warm.
