For some Celtic supporters it was almost too much. In the aftermath of Legia Warsaw’s second goal a man in a green polo shirt and beige fishing hat leapt to his feet and stood before the directors' box, arms outstretched.

He stood silent, unmoving. After a second or two he rubbed his fingers together in the unmistakable, international sign language of money. No words were uttered. None were required. His message was clear enough.

This was the year when Celtic gambled their Champions League ambitions on spending the bare minimum. A year when they placed their chips on black and lost to a Polish team in red. The punt finished up costing them £15million.

For this old club the Champions League has now become a tale of slow, steady decline. A process of corrosive decay culminating in something approaching humiliation.

This time last year Scotland’s champions scraped past Shakhter Karagandy of Kazakhstan to qualify for the group stages by the seat of their pants.

Since then they have played 10 games in this competition. They have won three – two against KR Reykjavik - and losing seven.

Defeats by AC Milan, Barcelona and Ajax they could tolerate. Home and away losses to Legia Warsaw are harder to explain.

Much of what happened here felt like a throwback. To routine, humble European exits to the Partizan Belgrades and Neuchatel Xamaxes of this world. Even the ultras of the Green Brigade were rendered mute.

At time up the there were no substantive boos, only numbness. This was a night which outlined the stark consequences of downsizing, selling key players, gambling and complacency. 

In the end the 6-1 aggregate scoreline was identical to that by which Legia beat the Irish part-timers of St Patrick’s Athletic.

And yet who can deny that Henning Berg’s team were thoroughly worthy winners over two games? As a Rangers player Berg never won an Old Firm game in five attempts. But that was against the Celtic of Larsson and Sutton.

Here Berg fared better, his Polish champions outclassing a desperately limited Celtic side. Describing just how poorly they played over two games is no easy task.

Trailing 4-1 from the first leg Ronny Deila needed a miracle here. On nights like these the Celtic way is to stage a cavalry charge. To come out the trenches, bayonets poking forth.

But there was none of that here. The ‘home’ team – playing at Murrayfield – huffed and puffed. They barely laid a glove on the Legia keeper Kuciak, save for long range shots in either half from Charlie Mulgrew and Anthony Stokes.

Neil Lennon's successor is not entirely to blame for what transpired here. But it is a substantial blow to his credibility.

Deila offered the view pre-match that it would hardly be the end of the world if Celtic failed to qualify. At times his team – with 11 men on the park this time - played as if they took him at his word.

It was all over in 35 minutes. Any slim, remote hope of another storming comeback to match St Etienne, Sporting Lisbon, Cologne or Karagandy was shattered when Michal Zyro raced onto a through ball from Kucharczyk and somehow managed to outpace and outwit a hopelessly indecisive Emilio Izaguirre.

There were laments for the Honduran’s exclusion from the first leg in Warsaw. But here he had one, two, chances to clear his lines. At the very worst Izaguirre could have fouled Zyro and taken the yellow. Instead he allowed the striker to take control, sprint clear and calmly slot the ball past Fraser Forster.

There were no wild, unrestrained celebrations from the rump of Legia supporters in the Murrayfield North Stand. They knew they were through from the early stages, from the period when their team settled into this game and looked utterly unruffled.

The inevitable was merely confirmed on the hour mark when, once again, Izaguirre was hesitant and negligent. 

The Honduran surrendered possession close to his own area and a delightfully deft dinked through ball from Zyro allowed Kucharczyk to ghost in and drag the ball wide before finishing brilliantly from an angle.

On the bench Deila sat impassive, a coach alone in his thoughts. The new man tried changing things. He brought Nir Biton in for Jo Inge Berget at the start. Stokes replaced Teemu Pukki, Mikael Lustig played in central defence for the suspended Efe Ambrose until he limped from the pitch injured after the hour.

In truth it made no real difference. 

In the early stages, when Celtic had to have the bit between the teeth, Legia looked tentative. For all of 10 minutes. After 20 they settled into the game. Celtic could make no impact.

Young Callum McGregor and Adam Matthews on the right flank were their main creative forces.

Three times the right back overlapped the composed 20-year-old, McGregor sending the Welshman scurrying towards the right touchline. Three times Matthews failed to find a green and white shirt with his low cut-backs. It was the story of the night. A night when Celtic looked utterly devoid of imagination, ideas or creativity.

Deila threw on Leigh Griffiths, Pukki and a fit again James Forrest in the dying stages. He could have thrown on Messi and Ronaldo to no avail. The game was gone.

Celtic were beaten, flat and utterly defeated. Away to the left of the main stand the Legia support bellowed their joy and defiance around an otherwise silent stadium.

A small flurry of supporters left the main stand in the dying moments, jabbing fingers at the Celtic directors as they went. How long ago Tony Watt and Barcelona feels now.

Who can say where this will 6-1 aggregate defeat to a bang average Polish team will end for Celtic now? The sales of Forster and Virgil van Dijk would be the educated guess.

Southampton want the England keeper and there is little reason now for either side to hang around. For Celtic’s increasingly disillusioned supporters the new season can wait until the numbness subsides.
