A routine stand-up paddleboard session unexpectedly turned into a giant turtle rescue mission on Friday morning.

Lifeguard Kasey Andrews was instructing the class at Wild Cattle Creek, near Gladstone - north of Brisbane, when she noticed what looked like a fin in the distance.

Once she established the fin wasn't a shark and was in fact a green turtle, Ms Andrews was determined to bring it to safety.

But it was her remarkable quick-thinking and improvised rescue technique - where she dove in after the struggling turtle and dragged it onto her board before paddling to shore - which saved the injured sea creature's life.

Ms Andrews - who runs Beach Paddles Tannum Sands - says she spotted the poor turtle, named Earl, tangled in a crab pot near a popular local fishing spot.

'All of a sudden I seen a float bobbing up and down near the creek mouth then what looked like a fin,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'I was a little cautious to get closer, in case it was a shark then it came up for a gasp of breath and showed it was a turtle.'

Ms Andrews called her nearby friend Gina Murphy over for help.

'Quick Gina, quick Gina - we have to rescue this!' Ms Andrews recalled yelling.

'Gina and I both decided the only way we were going to save this fella was to launch ourselves at him.

But the ordeal took half an hour, as the turtle was a fast swimmer - albeit injured.

'Gina and I weren't going anywhere, we were determined to get him as he was struggling more and more for air,' Ms Andrews said.

'Then he came up for another breath and I dove straight in after him. Diving very deep, I pulled the attached rope down until I had hold of his huge shell and he continued deeper. 

'All I can remember is looking up and seeing the sun shining on the water above thinking, I've got to come up for air, then all of a sudden the turtle flew back up to surface for another breath.'

The two friends will be visiting Earl next week, at the Quoin Island Turtle Rehabilitation Centre, which is when he is due to be released

Ms Andrews then yelled for her friend to bring the board over as they struggled to hoist the turtle onto the flotation device. 

'We both had a fin each and tried tirelessly to pull him onto board but no go,' she said.

'Then I decided to jump on board behind him, Gina stayed beside the turtle and we waited for a wave. As the wave hit us we both tried to haul turtle on bit by bit and centre him. We were exhausted, us and the poor turtle. 

It took 15 minutes to try and free Earl from the crab pot line he was entangled in. 

'Gina and I both looked at each other nearly crying with excitement and both agreed that we couldn't let him go, as his fin was damaged pretty bad,' Ms Andrews said.

So they persisted until they were able to untie him from the line. 

'It was a mission and a half,' Ms Andrews said. 

'I think everything that I have learnt from board rescue in lifesaving helped me for this, we wiggled the turtle up the board a little and I lay behind our dear friend while Gina swam beside the board helping me hold him on.' 

Once they hit the shore, the pair covered Earl in wet towels and called the Quoin Island Turtle Rehabilitation Centre straight away.

With the help of several bystanders, they were able to lift the giant turtle onto the back of a ute and drove him to meet rehab staff at the centre in Gladstone.

Ms Andrews says she plans on visiting her turtle friend at the rehabilitation centre next week, which is when he's due to be released.

'I guess its something you don't do every day - but it was very rewarding to be part of something so special,' she said.
