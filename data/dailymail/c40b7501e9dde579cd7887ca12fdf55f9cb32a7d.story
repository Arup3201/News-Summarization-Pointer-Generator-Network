It seems when it comes to problems faced on a daily basis, Australians have quite a unique collection to complain about.

From spiders popping up in all sorts of unexpected spots around the house, snakes setting up camp in the backyard to kangaroos battling it out in boxing matches in the streets many strange things happen in the land Down Under.

Earlier this month two kangaroos threw punches in a suburban street on the NSW Central Coast, much to the horror and amusement of locals who captured the fight.
