A 'sophisticated and lucrative' cannabis factory was discovered by police in the most unlikely of places - a £750,000 seven-bedroom Victorian mansion.

Drugs with an estimated street value of £160,000 were being grown in rooms throughout Oakenshaw Hall in Whitworth near Rochdale.

The house, which is set in large ornamental gardens and has three reception rooms, is currently up for sale for £745,000.

Cannabis factory: Drugs with a street value of £160,000 were found in the posh seven-bedroom Victorian mansion Oakenshaw Hall near Rochdale

'Sophisticated': Police described the cannabis growing operation at the Victorian mansion as 'sophisticated and lucrative' and also seized fans and lighting equipment

Unlikely place: Oakenshaw Hall, which is set in gardens with ornamental fountains, is up for sale for £745,000

Estate agents describe it as: 'A most impressive and characterful Victorian stone built seven-bedroomed detached resident with three reception rooms, dining-kitchen and conservatory.'

The mansion, to the north of Rochdale, is situated within a short walk of the picturesque Healey Dell Nature Reserve.

But inside the plush property, officers found 400 plants in various rooms during a raid on Tuesday. Lighting and fans were also seized from the house. The plants have been sent off for forensic analysis.

A 40-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of supplying cannabis and has been released on police bail pending further enquiries.

Stylish: One of the seven bedrooms inside the mansion

Luxury: One of the three reception rooms at Oakenshaw, which is located just to the north of Rochdale in Lancashire

Temporary Detective Sergeant Tony Atkins said: 'This was clearly a sophisticated and lucrative cannabis set up. The plants were all different sizes and were spread out throughout the seven-bedroomed property.

'It's fairly unusual for us to find such a large cannabis factory in a property of this type and size. I'm confident this will have a significant impact on the supply of cannabis in East Lancashire.

'We know the devastating impact drugs can have on our communities and we are determined to do everything we can to remove them from our streets.'

Anyone with information or concerns about cannabis can contact police on 1010 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

The estate agent listing for Oakenshaw Hall describes it as being 'in superb condition and beautifully presented throughout' with 'ornate mouldings in virtually all rooms.' 

It is also 'situated within a short walk of the beautiful woodland valley of Healey Dell Nature Reserve.'

Spacious: The Victorian-style conservatory with leather furnishings

The property, listed at £745,000, features:

Marble: One of the huge bathrooms with ornate sculptures
