THE MAGIC AND MYSTERY OF BIRDS By Noah Strycker (Souvenir Press £18)

Last week’s news that half the world’s wild animals have disappeared in the past 40 years should depress and anger every right-thinking person.

It’s not just exotic species we should be mourning, but British birds such as the corn bunting and the northern lapwing. Needless to say, it’s all the fault of humankind — greedy, selfish, short-sighted and thoughtless as ever. The albatross, for example, is on the verge of extinction because too often when it dives for fish it snares itself instead on the hook at the end of fishing long-lines.

If you think this isn’t your business, you couldn’t be more wrong. Ornithologist Noah Strycker’s illuminating — and, actually, rather moving — new book is a welcome reminder that we have much more to learn from the animal kingdom than we can even begin to know.

There are parallels between ourselves and birds: reproduction, movements, daily rhythms, communication, navigation and intelligence

Asking searching questions about why birds behave as they do, he offers poetic insights into our own existence.

A bird-lover since childhood and now a world-renowned ornithologist, he lists many ways in which there are parallels between ourselves and birds: reproduction, movements, daily rhythms, communication, navigation and intelligence. And he demonstrates how much better human society might be if we took the lessons of the birds to heart.

Birds find their way naturally, by means of methods humans have had to discover and invent, like starlings

Anybody who watched the extraordinary television series that attached cameras to birds in flight will be well aware of their miraculous abilities to wing their way across oceans and through storms, yet still land in the right place.

Birds find their way naturally, by means of methods humans have had to discover and invent, including magnetic fields, polarised light, echoes, ‘map’-reading, and infrasound. Strycker sounds proud when he writes: ‘You can blindfold a bird, cover its nostrils, cover its ears, transport it far from home in a magnetised cage and, more often than not, it will still manage to find its way home.’

After describing those magnificent movements of murmurations of starlings (like great, sweeping skeins of smoke), he concludes that explanation takes us beyond mere science.

To him, the beauty of the bird movement is as beyond scientific analysis as a Renaissance masterpiece — and the miracle of seemingly pointless beauty is itself a lesson.

As one critic has correctly pointed out, Strycker has the mind of a biologist, yet he writes like a poet. And what he has to tell us is fascinating. Unlike most mountain birds, which migrate south in the winter, the American nutcracker (similar to a woodpecker) not only stays put but actually lays its eggs during the brutal snowstorms of January and February. How does it survive? By stocking up.

Nutcrackers live on pine seeds, which they begin gathering in July, when pine cones first ripen, and continue harvesting until early winter. Carrying about a hundred seeds at a time in a special pouch under their tongue, they hide them under the soil in numerous locations in batches of just three or four.

And this, as Strycker notes, ‘is where nutcrackers transcend mere survival’. In just one season, a single nutcracker may store tens of thousands of pine seeds in as many as 5,000 different mini-caches. They don’t mark the spots where the seeds are hidden; indeed by the time they come to find them, the ground is often covered by snow. It’s an astonishing feat, achieved, as various experiments have proved, by them noting the landmarks near each cache.

The Australian fairy-wrens, with diminutive with violet crowns and long, shimmering blue tails, are all related to each other

And then there are the Australian fairy-wrens, diminutive with violet crowns and long, shimmering blue tails. Strycker spent months observing them in a six-mile stretch of creek and discovered they were all related to each other, ‘a sprawling family of a hundred siblings, uncles, cousins, grandparents and occasional newcomers’ who all took care of each other’s young — proving humans are not the only species capable of altruism. These are just some of the intriguing topics in this book.

The most moving chapter is about the albatross — the romantic, majestic bird of the freezing wastelands which can have a wingspan of 12ft and fly for 2,000 miles to pick up food for their hungry chicks. Yet even though they spend interminable amounts of time on the wing, this beautiful creature mates for life.

Twenty years after the first famous dancing courtship ritual (when they face each other, stretching huge wings while they dip and canoodle) they will be nesting with the same partner. The author comments: ‘Personally I think albatrosses feel love even more intensely than we do, and available evidence seems to back me up.

The Nazca booby is unusual in the bird world as it is known for routinely slaughtering its own siblings in the nest

‘No matter what category of affection you study, albatrosses beat us every time.’

Don’t forget that only about 5 per cent of the world’s 5,000 mammal species are socially monogamous. Strycker points out that about 40 per cent of new human marriages in the U.S. will end in divorce, ‘which places us on about the same level as the Nazca booby, a type of seabird known for . . . routinely slaughtering its own siblings in the nest.’

But albatrosses stay faithful and are good parents: ‘When they commit they quit the singles scene’ and ‘spend less time dancing and more time raising their chicks’.

Do you see what I mean about us needing to learn lessons from the birds?

In this, the last chapter, Strycker reaches new heights of beauty and imagination when he describes what he has seen — an albatross pair sleeping with the head of one bird pillowed on the breast of another, or tenderly caressing each other’s heads. I love that one of the world’s leading ornithologists can write: ‘Different people report seeing various things deep in the inky-black eyes of the albatross — wisdom, serenity, wilderness, peace, endurance — which are well and good, but all I see is love.’

For centuries, we have considered ourselves superior to all the other creatures who share this planet. Remote from nature, we think we know everything and exploit the members of the animal kingdom as our inferiors.

But writers such as Strycker remind us that, in many ways, they are more complete and more gifted — extraordinary and complex nations of their own, moving to an unseen music that we will never be able to hear.
