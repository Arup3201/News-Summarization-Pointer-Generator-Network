Peter Capaldi filmed a heartwarming message for his nine-year-old fan following the death of his grandmother

'Take care and be happy': The actor offered words of comfort to the young fan which, his father said, helped him cope with his grief 

Speaking in character, Mr Capaldi thanks the child for writing to him, and offers words of wisdom on life and death. 

'Thomas, hello! Thank you very much for your letter, I really enjoyed getting it,' he says, smiling into the camera. 

Mr Capaldi then goes on to refer to his on-screen companion, Clara, with whom he travels space and time in the BBC programme. 

'When Clara and I are travelling around time and space sometimes bad things happen to us.  

'And you know what Thomas, sometimes sad things happen to us too. 

'So it's nice to know that there's somebody out there like you who's on our side. 

'And you should know that we are on your side too. 

'So you look after yourself, you take care and be happy. Bye!' 

Posting the 42-second clip on YouTube, Thomas's father, Ross Goodall, wrote: 'A lovely message from Peter Capaldi to my 9 year old autistic son. 

'This arrived just before Thomas's nanny's funeral and helped him to deal with his grief in a profound way. 

Last week's episode of Doctor Who (illustrated) attracted more than 100 complaints from viewers who claimed themes of death and the afterlife were not suitable for children

'Thank you Peter so much.'

Hundreds of Dr Who fans have commented on the article, describing the actor as 'a true gentleman'. 

Last week the BBC was forced to defend a the penultimate episode in the eighth series after viewers complained themes of death and the afterlife were not suitable. 

More than 100 people complained to the Corporation over the edition which, they claimed, in at one point suggested corpses could feel the pain of being cremated. 

A spokesman for the show said: 'Doctor Who is a family drama with a long tradition of tackling some of the more fundamental questions about life and death. 

'We were mindful of the themes explored in Dark Water and are confident that they are appropriate in the context of the heightened sci-fi world of the show.

'The scene in which a character reveals 3W’s unconventional theory about the afterlife was preceded by the same character warning the Doctor and Clara several times that what they were about to hear could be distressing.

'When the Doctor does hear these claims, he immediately pours scorn on them, dismissing them out of hand as a ‘con’ and a ‘racket’. It transpires that he is correct, and the entire concept is revealed to be a scam perpetrated by Missy.'

The final episode of the eighth series will be shown on BBC One at 8pm.
