When Kate Moss was unveiled as the face and incredibly toned body of St Tropez earlier this week, the world was reminded of exactly why she has earned the title as the world's most famous supermodel.

The famed party girl may be 39, but in the tan campaign she displays the flawless skin of someone half her age.

But as someone who likes the odd cigarette and night out on the town, many are left wondering how does she maintain such a glowing visage?

So THAT'S her secret! Kate Moss submerges her face in ice and cucumber water every day to keep her skin looking supple and awake

But now her intriguing beauty secret has been revealed: the supermodel submerges her face into a sinkful of iced cucumber water in the morning to perk up her skin.

'If I wake up looking tired and puffy, I fill a sink with ice and cucumber and submerge my face.

'It tightens everything making you look and feel instantly awake. It is a bit Joan Crawford - but it works!,' she told Stylist magazine.

Cucumber and the skin share the same level of hydrogen, so the fruit can easily help to cure problem areas.

She's still got it: Posing in her latest campaign for St. Tropez, the 39-year-old proves she's still got what it takes, is it all thanks to her beauty trick?

It has a cooling effect and helps in soothing and softening the skin.

And, even better, it costs no more than a pound.

Speaking about how she keeps her beach body in tip-top condition, Moss also explained that she thoroughly exfoliates her skin before she jets off on holiday and practices plenty of Pilates to ensure her body is toned to perfection.

Inspirations: Kate cites Jerry Hall as one of her beauty icons and is also inspired by David Bowie

The famed model also cited Jerry Hall as one of her beauty icons, explaining that she loves sexy Seventies pin-ups with 'all-round glamour', adding that she is equally inspired by the likes of David Bowie.

The former wild child has been making somewhat of a comeback lately with several public appearances as well as her St Tropez campaign.

Kate said of her new signing: ‘I’m so 
excited to be working with St.Tropez. I’ve been using the products since
 they started and it’s a really trustworthy, cool brand. I always feel 
more confident with a St.Tropez tan.’
