A murderer who has spent nearly half a century behind bars is back on Britain's streets today.

Alan Houchin, 75, was jailed in 1965 for strangling teenage waitress Shona Berry in Margate, Kent.

After being released on licence 11 years later, he was again jailed for life in 1979 for the rape of a 19-year-old shop assistant.

After spending 46 of the last 49 
years behind bars, Houchin was released this week and is now planning to
 get married to his former partner Mary Griggs, 54.

There was anger at his release yesterday, with members of victim Miss Berry's family hitting out at the parole board's decision.

A
 relative, who asked not to be named, told the Daily Mirror: 'I am in a 
state of shock. No one told me he had been let out. I am horrified.

'I had been told all along he was too dangerous to be let out of prison and he would never be freed.'

Houchin's partner Mrs Griggs has said she plans to marry the former-convict at a ceremony later this year.

The
 couple are now living in a council house in Swanley, Kent, 
but local residents have said they do not want him in the area.

Neighbours say Houchin has been a 
regular visitor to the house over the last couple of years as he was 
allowed out of prison on day release.

One said: 'He's always out there tinkering with his car. Mary told me he used to be in prison and she used to go and visit him and he would come and see her on day release too.

'Of course I've heard rumours about what he did. I've heard he killed a young girl and raped another girl.

'I've never asked him about it though - you just wouldn't. Mary keeps to herself, most of the time, which is something we all do around here.

'If he is a convicted murderer and rapist I definitely don't want him living round here.'

Houchin's
 victim Shona Berry was found dead in a park in the seaside resort of 
Margate in August 1965 after staying in the town with friends.

Houchin narrowly avoided a death sentence for the murder, because he was sentenced just seven days after capital punishment was abolished.

Following his release from his first prison stretch on licence, his life sentence was reimposed in 1979 for the rape.

His sentence was increased after he went on the run
 in 1993, when he escaped from guards while visiting his sickly father in a south London hospice.

Houchin convinced officers to leave him alone and remove his handcuffs so he could have one last 'intimate moment' with his father, before disappearing.

During his two weeks at large police warned Houchin was 'charming but dangerous' and 'should not be approached'.

On his recapture he was sent to Belmarsh Prison, where he was beaten by three prisoners with a battery in a sock after they discovered he was a sex offender.

In April 2006, he was transferred to open conditions at HMP North Sea Camp in Lincolnshire after the risk he posed to the public was assessed as 'medium'.

In 2010 he won a controversial High Court battle to be switched to a more comfortable prison with less security.

But a senior officer later decided he remained 'high risk' and he was moved back to a more secure jail.

Houchin then sought damages from Lincolnshire probation service, claiming he became 'stressed and anxious' after being taken back into stricter conditions.

He claimed his liberty was restricted, he was forced to share a cell with a smoker and lost his appetite.

Victim's
 charity Support After Murder and Manslaughter have expressed concerns that he may still 
be dangerous because of his history of crime.

Chief Executive Rose Dixon said: 'I cannot believe they are letting this guy out with the history of violence he has.

'I understand prison staff had concerns about him in the past and I cannot understand why he has been released.'

Among Britain's longest-serving prisoners are Moors murderer Ian Brady, 76, who is still serving the three life sentences he was given in 1966, and Harry Roberts, 77, who was also locked up in 1966 for the murder of three policemen in London.
