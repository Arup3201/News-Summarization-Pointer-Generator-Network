The Tokyo Game Show this year has two big stars, Sony's PlayStation 4 and the Microsoft Xbox One.

But with huge numbers of young, barely dressed models also in attendance, game fans may well find their gaze drawn elsewhere.

Asia's largest video game expo kicked off today at Makuhari Messe Convention Center in Chiba, east of Tokyo, with a record number of games developers taking part.

And judging by these pictures, they have brought with them record numbers of scantily-clad young women, leading to scenes reminiscent of a Seventies-era car show.

Like a Seventies car show... The game show kicked off with a record high number of exhibitors consisting of 352 companies and organisations from 33 different countries

Many of the models are dressed as characters from the games - complete with colourful wigs, skimpy outfits and oversized, futuristic weaponry.

Others were provocatively styled as cro- top-wearing, cleavage-baring schoolgirls, complete with the knee socks and tartan skirts more typically associated with Japanese school uniforms.

The contrast with the show's visitors - mostly conservatively dressed men - offers an apt reminder of why the computer entertainment industry is under attack for its representation of women.

But such debates were quite clearly off the cards at today's event, where most attention was directed at the eagerly awaited new offerings from Sony and Microsoft.

In a reversal of the old order, both the Playstation 4 and the Xbox One are to go on sale first in the U.S. and Europe in November, far ahead of expected Japanese release dates slated for next year.

Sony and Microsoft both say tailoring the machines for the Japanese market takes more time but many in the gaming world see the delay as symbolic of Japan's loss of its pioneering and leading role in the industry.

With eyes on a comeback, this year's show has a renewed focus this year on independent game software developers.

Game insiders and experts say that encouraging a new breed of game creators is crucial for Japan to regain its status in the game world, ceded over the years to the U.S. and Europe where startups face fewer obstacles.

It's felt that the broader stagnation witnessed in the Japanese economy also infected the game world, where big success was followed by complacency, and even a stifling of newcomers.

A presentation by Sony executives today signalled this fresh attempt to woo independent developers. Flashed on a giant screen was the slogan made up of the words 'PS,' which stands for PlayStation, and 'indies,' with a big red heart mark in the middle.

'We are welcoming the contributions of independent developers,' said Masayasu Ito, senior vice president at Sony Computer Entertainment, the Tokyo-based electronics and entertainment giant's game division.Â

Star game producer Keiji Inafune believes Japan must first recognise its failure before it can move on, as most have become too comfortable and set in their ways, resting on the laurels of past success. Still worse, they have grown cautious, and churn out sequels of the old formulas, instead of taking risks, he said.

'Suddenly, Japanese games weren't selling, and they didn't look as good as they used to look, compared to foreign games,' he told The Associated Press.

'We need to first confront our own defeat, and we need to start learning from the world.'

Previously a star creative at Capcom, where over a sparkling three-decade career he was behind such hits as Mega Man and Dead Rising, Mr Inafune started his own game company Comcept three years ago.

He says he is determined to show Japan is ready to reinvent itself.

'Japan is going to rise again to the top,' he said at his Comcept office in Tokyo. 'We have to go back to our roots and rediscover what made Japan great.'

Both Sony and Microsoft insist the delay in the Japanese launch of their machines is to give more time for preparation.

The PlayStation 4, which goes on sale on November 15 in the U.S. and Canada, and on November 29 in Europe, goes on sale in Japan on February 22, 2014 - the first time a major Sony console is not going on sale first in Japan.

Microsoft Xbox One also isn't set to go on sale in Japan until next year although its global launch is set for November 22. No date for the Japan sale is being announced.

Phil Spencer, corporate vice president at Microsoft Game Studios, says tailoring Xbox One for the Japanese market is taking more time, such as making sure the voice recognition feature works and signing on partnerships for local content.

But he denied the importance of Japan was diminishing for Microsoft, and stressed more software titles were in the works for Xbox One, including 'D4' from star developer Hidetaka Suehiro.

Instead, he said the changes were more about a growing diversity in types of games because they were being played on smartphones and tablets, as well as consoles.

'The creative capability here is without match,' said Mr Spencer.
