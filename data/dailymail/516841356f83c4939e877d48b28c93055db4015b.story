Savings: George Osborne has outlined a range of measures to pay for his pledge

David Cameron will today try to bring an end to weeks of wrangling over energy prices by promising handouts of £1,000 to new home-buyers.

The surprise move will form part of a package of measures in George Osborne’s Autumn Statement - seen as a ‘mini-Budget’ - including plans to cut energy bills by £50 a year through the scrapping of green levies.

The £1,000 grant, which is to pay for ‘energy saving measures’, is a sop to Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, who resisted moves to axe  the levies.

Mr Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg will jointly declare that the average £50 cut will be achieved ‘without taking any help away from poor families or sacrificing our green commitments’.

The savings are likely to be achieved partly by slashing the number of solid wall insulations energy companies are required to fit - the cost of which is passed on to consumers - from 100,000 to just 25,000 each year. This is expected to generate a saving of £40 per household.

A further saving of about £10 will be achieved by the Government agreeing to meet the cost of the Warm Home Discount - which reduces bills for thousands of vulnerable customers - rather than forcing the energy companies to pay for it and pass on the cost.

To accommodate objections that cutting the levies will undermine moves to make homes and businesses more energy-efficient, the two leaders will also make the declaration that anyone buying a home will receive up to £1,000 from the Government - ‘or even more for particularly expensive measures’ - to pay for insulation if it is needed.

Mr Cameron is determined to wrest the political initiative over energy prices back from Mr Miliband, who has pledged to impose a price freeze for two years if Labour wins the next General Election.

However, attempts by No 10 to cut a deal with the companies - and then square the arrangement with the Lib Dems - became increasingly fraught as details leaked into the media.

No 10 was forced to deny vigorously a BBC report that Ministers were demanding a price freeze from energy companies until the Election.

The measures will form the centrepiece of Mr Osborne’s Autumn Statement. However, he also faces pressure from Tory MPs to introduce wider economic reforms.

In an article for today’s Mail on Sunday (below) previewing a paper he has written for the Centre for Policy Studies think-tank, rising Tory star Dominic Raab demands a raft of middle-class tax cuts worth nearly £3,000 a year to many higher-rate taxpayers – funded by a radical £17.6 billion of spending cuts.

Proposals: Dominic Raab MP, pictured, says the road to prosperity is to lower taxes and Government spending

Ed Miliband yearns to mimic Ronald Reagan’s winning pitch to voters in the 1980 US Presidential election: ‘Are you better off than you were five years ago?’

Yet most voters look to the future. If he’s prepared to be bold, David Cameron can still convince people they will be better off under him.

It’s because - not despite - the challenges Britain still faces that people want a leader who can deliver a brighter future, not just fleeting respite from the recent economic mire.

Even at face value, Miliband would struggle on Reagan’s test. Many fundamentals - including unemployment and inflation - have improved since 2010. But the challenge remains steep.

Government has too much debt, the country too little to show for the recovery.

The answer isn’t to match Miliband’s Wonga economics - including price controls on energy firms.

Starting with the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement on Thursday, the Conservatives should chart a clear, honest and principled road map for prosperity. In a report for the Centre for Policy Studies, I set out several key steps.

First, less Government spending and lower taxes. The Conservatives should offer a triple-lock promise: to reduce the tax burden by 2020, not to increase personal taxes, and apply a one-in, one-out rule to any other new taxes.

To do so we must rein back further stubbornly high public spending.

We can save £17.6billion by steps including halving the number of Government departments and means-testing more benefits such as winter fuel and bus passes.

We should cut employers’ National Insurance and business rates to power job creation and level the high street’s playing field with online retailers.

We should lead, not follow, the debate about the lowest paid. Miliband’s jobs-killing proposal to legislate for a living wage would hurt the long-term and young unemployed most. A better idea is to raise the threshold for employee NI, properly funded and targeted.

Finally, middle-class Peter should not be robbed to pay working-class Paul.

While the income tax collected from the basic rate has fallen ten per cent under the Coalition, the amount collected from the higher rate is up by a third. Anyone earning £20,000 a year has felt a rising tax burden.

By tackling public spending, the Tories can ease the squeeze on the middle classes. We should cut the basic and higher rates of income tax by a penny each. Long term, we should merge NI and income tax – and move to two rates at 15 and 35 per cent, to boost UK competitiveness and reward hard work and ambition.

David Cameron has the conviction and charisma, but must also display some Reaganite will, to illuminate the path towards brighter days ahead.
