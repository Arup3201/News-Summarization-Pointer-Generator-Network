The boss of an energy giant that has doubled its prices in just seven years could pocket a £13million payoff.

Phil Bentley, who is to leave British Gas within months, has presided over above-inflation hikes that have pushed average bills past £1,300 a year.

The latest punishing rise of 6 per cent comes as millions endure the greatest squeeze on living standards since the 1920s.

In stark contrast, 53-year-old Mr Bentley’s potential windfall would be enough to pay a typical family’s gas and electricity bill for 9,500 years.

Figures from the watchdog Consumer Focus put the average bill at £735 in 2006 – a year before Mr Bentley became managing director. Today it is £1,353 – an increase of 84 per cent.

Before the winter each of the Big Six energy providers – British Gas, EDF, SSE, Eon, Npower and Scottish Power – announced big hikes in power tariffs.

Another rise of up to 5 per cent is expected this year, according to the Office of Budget Responsibility, the Government’s independent forecasting body.

The increase – of around £70 – would push the average bill to £1,420 a year.

Mr Bentley will leave British Gas later this year as part of a management overhaul, sources inside the group confirmed.

It is thought he has fallen out with Sam Laidlaw – chief executive of parent company Centrica – over strategic direction.

Insiders say Mr Bentley was being lined up as 57-year-old Mr Laidlaw’s successor and was keen on the job.

But, with Mr Laidlaw unwilling to leave, Mr Bentley is said to have decided to pursue other options and will be given a ‘golden goodbye’.

Analysis by the Daily Mail of Centrica’s annual report and details of share awards sent to investors over the past 12 months show he could walk away with £12.9million.

As the boss of British Gas, which supplies 12million homes, he received a basic salary of £635,000 in 2011 – the most recent year for which figures are available.

He also received perks worth £46,000 including a company car and private medical cover – as well as a discount of almost £700 from his own energy bill.

In 2011 he was given a bonus in shares worth £399,000 that he will be able to cash in during 2014.

When he leaves, it is widely expected he would receive 12 months of salary, as well as being granted access to the bonus shares.

But the bulk of his payoff would come from numerous reward schemes that potentially entitle him to a further 2,489,081 shares.

Most of the schemes mature over a three-year period and depend upon the company hitting its performance targets.

If the remuneration committee decides to waive the normal conditions and hand Mr Bentley all of his outstanding shares, he would receive a pot worth some £8.3million at yesterday’s share price of 334p.

They could do this as a gift of thanks for his service to the business, which he joined in 2000. However they may argue he is not entitled to the full amount because he is leaving the company early.

Struggling: Mr Bentley's potential windfall would be enough to pay a typical family's gas and electricity bill for 9,500 years

The annual report shows he has a pension pot with a transfer value of £3.6million. The share awards, along with his salary and bonus and pension pot, amount to £12.9million.

Centrica last night refused to comment on Mr Bentley’s payoff, or any details of his departure.

Sources inside British Gas say Mr Bentley transformed the customer service department and pumped millions of pounds into its UK call centres. Last year British Gas received 5 stars from consumer groups Which? and Consumer Focus for customer satisfaction.

But Tom Greatrex, a Labour energy spokesman, said: ‘British Gas customers, who have seen their bills soar on Phil Bentley’s watch, will be astonished at the level of his payoff.

‘When hard-pressed families are having their incomes squeezed it will strike many as an obscene level of reward.

‘British Gas should be focused on reducing prices for their customers not paying departing executives millions in bonuses.’

James Granger, of the Fuel Poverty Action group, said: ‘The £12.9million could be used to insulate thousands of homes and fund investment in the cheaper, cleaner renewable energy we need to bring bills down and tackle climate change.’
