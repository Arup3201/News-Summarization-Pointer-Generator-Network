'Momentum': Baroness Parminter wants a commitment for a charge on plastic bags

Senior Liberal Democrats have called for a charge on plastic bags to be included in this month's Budget.

They argue it is time for the Coalition to take firm action to slash the numbers handed out to shoppers in England, despite the concerns of the Treasury.

Nick Clegg and David Cameron have both voiced support for reducing the environmental impact of bags on the landscape and wildlife, highlighted by the Daily Mail's Banish the Bags campaign. But they have fallen short of imposing a ban.

However support is said to be mounting within the Deputy Prime Minister's party who feel their ministers are in a strong position, following their win in the by-election in Eastleigh, to make demands in the Budget negotiations.

A 5p charge has already succeeded in slashing the numbers of bags handed out in Wales over the past year, a charge begins in Northern Ireland next month, and plans for one are under consideration in Scotland.

Yesterday the party's environment spokesman in the Lords, Baroness Parminter of Godalming, said there was 'growing momentum' for measures in England.

She said: 'This is the direction of travel and I and others would like to see it resolved with a formal commitment by the Government to introduce charges on plastic bags in the lifetime of this parliament. There is growing momentum for it.'

She said charges would deliver financial as well as environmental benefits, as householders are paying the 'hidden costs' of disposing of millions of plastic bags on their council tax bills.

Plastic carrier bags are typically used for just 20 minutes, and either end up in landfill or can blight the landscape and seas for hundreds of years, killing wildlife and birds.

Baroness Parminter, a former chief executive of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: 'We would favour something along the Welsh lines of a 5p charge, going up to a maximum of 10p, and encouraging the supermarkets to give the money to local charities and community food projects.'

Baroness Parminter said the only countries in Europe who do not have an agreement to curtail the use of bags are England, Finland, Poland and Greece.

She said the Government should take the lead and ban bags itself, as legislation could be imposed by the European Union under a directive next year to reduce packaging.

Yesterday an aide to George Osborne, Amber Rudd, said ministers wanted to cut plastic bag use without imposing a new tax. The Tory MP for Hastings and Rye said: 'I find that my local supermarkets are charging me for plastic bags.

'There's a kind of shame factor to it, 'did you bring your own bags' they say and I think that's working quite well.

'We don't like introducing new taxes, Britons are finding it difficult enough with their cost of living. Let people try and adjust before introducing a new tax.'
