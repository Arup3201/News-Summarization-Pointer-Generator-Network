Staying warm in the winter is often a case of piling on more and more layers.

But one entrepreneur has found a new way to keep the cold weather at bay - by creating  clothes with built in 'central heating'.

The Podz Gear shirt has six pockets which hold thermo-chemical packs over the body's major blood vessels, turning the wearer's circulatory system into a heating network.

A Kentucky-based inventor has designed a shirt with heated pockets. Called Podz Gear (shown) it has six pouches that store thermo-chemical packs. The pockets are positioned in a way that a person's whole body is heated. Regular hand warmers can also be used in each of the pockets

It was invented by Kentucky-based Dwaine Evans who wanted to solve the problem of getting cold during paintball games without prohibiting his movement with bulky layers.

The entrepreneur  developed the thermal base layer - which has reusable heaters on the shoulders, stomach and hips - which sells for £47 in the UK ($74.95 in the US).

The product, which is currently seeking funding on Kickstarter, has six different pockets in which heat packets can be stored.

Researchers at the Institute of Textiles and Clothing in Hong Kong have created a fabric circuit board (FCB) that could be incorporated into clothing for a number of purposes.

One of these is the ability to create ‘smart bulletproof vests’ that could tell people away from the front lines that the person wearing it has been shot.

And the team who made the fabric circuit board says it can be stretched a million times and washed 30 times with no detrimental effects.

The team put some of the FCBs inside energy-absorbing fabrics such as Kevlar to create the smart vests.

A bullet was then fired into the vest, and they found that the fabric circuits could register when they had been shot.

This means that, on the battlefield for example, they could send a signal to a medic when a solider has been shot. 

According to the inventor, these evenly spread heat over a person's body, ensuring they stay warm in cold conditions.

'Podz Gear takes the place of multiple layers of clothing and keeps the user warmer while not restricting mobility,' the company writes on Kickstarter.

'Pockets are designed to hold thermo-chemical packs and are arranged along major blood vessels.

'This allows the wearer's circulatory system to use the blood as a heat transfer fluid.

'Using the blood to modify body temperature permits the wearer to maintain their appendage and core body temperature and enhance their tolerance of otherwise uncomfortable or dangerous temperatures.' 

The top is available in green, blue, red or black, while the thermal insets can also be replaced by hand warmers bought from garages and supermarkets. 

However, the company adds that for every 30 minutes the heat packets are used, they should be taken out for five minutes to prevent the clothing overheating.

They also add that those with sensitive skin should keep the heat packets in for less time.

The £47 ($74.95) product is currently part of a Kickstarter campaign. 'Podz Gear takes the place of multiple layers of clothing and keeps the user warmer while not restricting mobility,' the company writes on Kickstarter. 'Pockets are designed to hold thermo-chemical packs and are arranged along major blood vessels'

Wearing the shirt against your skin with no layer underneath keeps the heat packs as close as possible to your body (illustrated). This allows them to transfer heat to your arteries and veins, which can then be circulated around your body in cold weather
