With their fur dyed bright colours and cut into shapes to look like different animals and insects, this is the latest trend for pets in Russia.

A salon is offering the unusual styling to four-legged friends - and even claims the animals enjoy having it done. 

In this intriguing footage, Daria Gotz, the owner of a salon in Yekaterinburg, shows off a cat that's been styled to to look like a dragon - and a dog that resembles a bumblebee.

It is not made clear whether chemicals in the dye could be harmful to the animals, although salon owner MsGotz claims that they are pet-friendly.

She told Liveleak.com that the dyes are made from natural botanical extracts, adding: 'Those dyes which we use are absolutely pet-friendly and producers claim that they have a healthful effect on the animals' coat.

'The dyes are made from natural botanical extracts, they are Korean.'

Ekaterina Aidimirova, the bee-dog's Bettie owner, said: 'It was boring so we decided to make our dog bright, summery, adorable, and dyed her hair like a bee - a colourful look.'  

 According to reports, the dye remains on the coats for several months until it grows out.

Dangerous: The RSPCA says that dyeing animals sends out an 'extremely worrying message'

While the owner of the pet beauty salon claims that the dye is not harmful and maybe even beneficial for the animals' health,  reports detailing the health risks of the procedure exist.

A spokesman for the RSPCA told MailOnline that animals should not be painted or dyed for cosmetic reasons.

He said: 'This could have potentially fatal consequences.

'Pets could potentially find being held and restrained whilst the dyeing process is undertaken very stressful.

'Cats are highly fastidious creatures and will groom any substance from their coats to keep themselves clean. Having an unwanted substance in their coat could lead them to ingest the dye.

'Our pets are living creatures and dyeing them in this way sends out an extremely worrying message that they could be viewed as novelty accessories rather than as intelligent, sentient animals,' he added.
