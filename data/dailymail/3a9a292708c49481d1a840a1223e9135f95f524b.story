David Moyes has taken a bold step into the relatively unknown by moving to Real Sociedad but there is more than enough talent, history and potential at the club to make it the perfect coaching comeback for the former Everton and Manchester United manager.

Sportsmail's Spanish football expert Pete Jenson tells us why... 

David Moyes is back in management with Real Sociedad after his difficult tenure at Manchester United 

The playing squad

In November the league table is still capable of lying and the truth is there is no way Real Sociedad are the 15th best team in Spain. They have already beaten both Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid this season and the group of players that David Moyes inherits will be enough to give them a top-half finish in his first season.

The club sold Claudio Bravo to Barcelona in the summer but Enaut Zubikarai is an experienced stand in. Geronimo Rulli, the big summer signing from Estudiantes in Argentina, is waiting to return from a broken finger suffered in pre-season and 23-year-old Enrique Royo is a hugely talented keeper waiting for his chance.

At the heart of the defence, Inigo Martínez is still only 23 and Moyes should be able to guide him back to the sort of form that made him many people’s tip to become a fixture in Spain’s squad and earn a move to Barcelona. 

Yuri Berchiche signed in the summer from newly-promoted Eibar, and at 24, has a bright future at the club

Around him there is stability with Alberto de la Bella, Carlos Martinez, Mikel Gonzalez all having been at the club, and very often in the same back four, for the last four seasons. 

De la Bella is currently out with an achilles problem but Yuri Berchiche is an able replacement who signed in the summer from newly-promoted Eibar and at 24 is another one with a future at the club.

The central midfield pairing is usually Markel Bergara and former Real Madrid and Queens Park Rangers midfielder Esteban Granero but Ruben Pardo is the diamond in the rough – an Under 19 European champion with Spain he was on Real Madrid’s wish list two seasons ago but Sociedad resisted and now all it needs is for Moyes to help the 22-year-old fulfill his enormous potential.

In the line of three behind the striker Moyes will have plenty of talent to call upon. Carlos Vela usually plays centrally and top scored last season with 16 league goals. 

Club stalwarts David Zurutuza and Xabi Prieto are good soldiers who will stand up to be counted. The pair have played almost 400 games between them for the club and Prieto’s set-piece delivery will be another weapon Moyes can use to the team’s advantage. 

Sergio Canales is another who has lost his way but if the still-only-23-year-old midfielder, for whom Real Madrid paid £4million when he was just 18, can regain form and fitness, then Moyes will have one of the most gifted players in the division at his disposal.

Leading the line, Imanol Agirretxe will work hard as a loan striker and Iceland centre forward Alfred Finnbogason, signed in the summer from Heerenveen in Holland where he scored 29 goals in just 31 games, will give Moyes a more physical option.

Boardroom backing

There will not be huge amounts to spend. Real Sociedad are a selling club and if Moyes manages to bring the best out in players such as Inigo Martinez and Pardo then the club will be tempted to cash in again. 

But what he will benefit from is one of the best youth academies in Europe. The Zubieta sports city has so often been the foundation of the club’s success. 

There was a time around a decade ago when the attention switched to foreign signings but the club paid the price ending a 40-year run in the top division with relegation in 2007. 

It took them three seasons to come back but with a team built on youth they finally won the second division in 2010 and Moyes will be entrusted as the keeper of that youth team tradition.

History and support

The club’s Anoeta Stadium holds 32,000 and although performances were, in the main, poor last season the average was still in excess of 22,500. 

Buoyed by Moyes’ arrival they will get behind the team in the next home game against Elche and fill the ground for the Basque derby on December 14. 

Another British former manager, Chris Coleman, used to complain about how the running track around the pitch affected the atmosphere but that won't stop them creating a cauldron for their visit of their local rivals.

It is Spain’s ‘friendly derby’ perhaps the closest La Liga has to the Merseyside meetings Moyes managed during his decade at Goodison Park.

The Real Sociedad fans have endured a tough campaign so far, but will still be hoping for a top-half finish 

Expectations

Real Sociedad were champions in 1981 and 1982 and they also finished runners-up in 2003 but times have changed and the fans know that.

The annual budget is just south of £50m and financially it is not just that they struggle to live with the big two, they are also some way behind Atletico Madrid and Valencia.

Playing well, competing for a Europa League place and improving the players he has will be how Moyes is judged. If he develops players and keeps the club in the top half of the first division with attractive football then he will not be questioned. No-one will expect trophies – a repeat of his results record at Everton will keep everyone happy.

John Toshack coached the club for 322 games winning 126 of them and lifting the Copa del Rey in 1987

Wales boss Coleman (pictured in 2007) was the last British manager to have taken charge of Real Sociedad

And topping Toshack?

John Benjamin Toshack, as he is always referred to in Spain, coached Sociedad for 322 games winning 126 of them and lifting the Copa del Rey in 1987.

The man he really wants to beat however is Alberto Ormaetxea, who won those two leagues. They were called the Humble Champions and even made the European Cup semi-finals.

With Spain legend Luis Arconada in goal and fellow internationals Jesus Satrustegui and Roberto Lopez Ufarte in attack they took on Barcelona and Real Madrid and managed back-to-back titles.

In their current state back-to-back wins would be nice – Moyes can do that with victory over Deportivo Saturday week when his adventure begins at 10pm, local time.
