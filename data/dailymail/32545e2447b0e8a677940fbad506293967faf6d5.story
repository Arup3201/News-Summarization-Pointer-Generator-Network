A woman struggling to cope after breaking up with her boyfriend went berserk and strangled her mother, a court heard.

Emma Parr, 38, transformed from a ‘happy, bubbly young woman’ to a killer in the space of just six months.

She was suffering from severe depression when she throttled her mother Carol, 62, who had told her that she was planning to sell the family home where they lived happily together.

Parr recollected little of what had happened though she spoke of disappointment her mother no longer wanted to live with her

Mrs Parr’s body was discovered by a relative after colleagues raised the alarm when she failed to turn up for work.

Police
 later found her daughter, who had attempted suicide just weeks earlier,
 driving her car in her pyjamas 17 miles away. When questioned, the 
university department manager told police she remembered little of what 
had happened, except ‘disappointment’ that her mother had decided she 
didn’t want to live with her.

Psychiatric
 examinations concluded Miss Parr was suffering from a ‘severe 
depressive episode’ and had psychotic symptoms at the time.

Yesterday
 she was jailed for just ten months after a judge ruled she was a 
‘caring and loving person’ whose deadly attack was ‘largely outside her 
control’.

She admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished 
responsibility after the prosecution accepted her not guilty plea to 
murder.

Mr Justice 
Alistair MacDuff told Miss Parr: ‘This is the saddest of cases. Just one
 short year ago you were a happy bubbly young woman with many happy 
years ahead of you. You had a good job, happy family, friends and good 
health. No one, not even with the most effective crystal ball, could 
have foretold what was to happen.

‘What
 you did on that dreadful night was largely outside your control. 
Through it all you continued to love your mother and she you.

Carol's body was found on her bedroom floor wearing her pyjamas when she failed to turn up for work at Penny Lane Cafe

‘What
 you did was wholly out of character – and you are a loving and caring 
person who will find it difficult in the future to live with this 
episode.’

Liverpool Crown 
Court heard that the killing, in June last year, followed six months of 
unhappiness for Miss Parr, who worked as a data manager in the Molecular
 and Clinical Cancer Medicine department at the University of Liverpool.
 She and her mother had been as close as sisters, living together, 
socialising and holidaying in exotic locations like Dubai.

But
 Miss Parr’s life began to crumble following a break-up in January last 
year. Simon Berkson, defending, told the court she had been devastated 
by the end of her romance at a time when she may have had hopes of 
settling down and starting a family.

The
 court heard Miss Parr became introspective and her relationship with 
her mother was ‘strained and tense’. In May, she took an overdose of 
paracetamol in a suicide attempt. She became anxious about the damage 
she might have done to her liver, and began following her mother around 
and sleeping in her bed at night.

On
 the evening of June 9 last year, Mrs Parr had had enough of her 
daughter’s behaviour. She told her she was thinking of selling their 
home in Walton, Liverpool, as she couldn’t cope any longer.

Emma was seen by neighbours climbing out of a bedroom window onto a flat roof and folding clothes as if to go on a trip

Carol's body was found on her bedroom floor wearing her pyjamas when she failed to turn up for work

The mother and daughter lived, socialised and even holidayed together and had a close relationship 'akin to sisters'

A
 struggle followed and at 2am Miss Parr dialled 999 to request an 
ambulance.

The operator could hear ‘groaning noises’ in the background, 
but Miss Parr then said paramedics were not needed.

Her mother’s body 
was found on her bedroom floor later that day after she failed to turn 
up at the cafe where she worked as a waitress.

Officers discovered Miss Parr several hours later, driving her car in her pyjamas with bare feet in Runcorn, Cheshire.

She
 was detained at a psychiatric clinic for nearly six months under the 
Mental Health Act before being charged with her mother’s murder in 
November.

Mrs Parr’s 
brother Thomas Gregory told the court the family had been ‘torn apart’ 
by the tragedy but he loved his niece and was supporting her.

‘We can’t 
turn back the clock and must face the future. Hopefully, with support 
from all of us Emma will be able to have a normal life. Carol would not 
want Emma to suffer in any way.’

Miss Parr’s brother, Jason, a father of two, added: ‘Justice is needed for my mum but I need my sister and my sister needs me.’
