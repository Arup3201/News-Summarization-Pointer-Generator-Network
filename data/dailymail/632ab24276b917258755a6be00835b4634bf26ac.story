The must-have eBooks of 2014 have been revealed ahead of the reading season - perfect for everyone!

It seems Australian readers are not falling head over heels for romance novels.

By breaking down data collected from Kobo users throughout 2014, the inaugural Book Report found Australian readers are most captivated by mystery, with 63.5 percent finishing off books in this category.

‘We expected to see more people to finish a romance novel to find out the happy ending but it was interesting to see people were more interested in “who did it” mystery books,’ APAC director of content Malcolm Neil told Daily Mail Australia.

The report found 56.5 percent of readers finished Sci-Fi novels while non-fiction's score was 37.8 percent.

Kobo president and chief content officer Michael Tamblyn said: ‘A book’s position on the bestseller list may indicate it’s bought, but that isn’t the same as it being read or finished.

‘A lot of readers have multiple novels on the go at any given time, which means they may not always read one book from start to finish before jumping into the next great story.

‘Different kinds of books also have different reading patterns. Novels are read cover-to-cover, but a work of non-fiction could be sampled for facts rather than read to completion.’

The Book Report found Australians are more captivated by mysterious reads than romance

Topping the list of books read to completion in Australia was James Patterson, while Canada and the USA saw Nora Roberts take out the title.

'The most surprising book that hit the list would be Capital in the Twenty-First Century by Thomas Piketty because you wouldn't expect people to buy a big serious book about economics - it's a really hard book to read,' Mr Neill said.

Looking at Australia’s bestselling books of 2014, Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn topped the list, boosted by the release of the film of the same name in October.

'We got to see how much impact books have on films,’ Mr Neil told Daily Mail Australia.

‘Gone Girl sold massive amounts before the release of the film. It surprised me because it’s an old book which was released back in 2012.'

Over a three-month period, 33 percent of Gone Girl's sales occurred in the week prior and week after the movie’s premiere.

‘The harrowing experience that influenced people to read the book before or after the film was good to see readers wanted to extend their experience,’ he said.

From mystery, thriller, romance to comedy – there’s something for everyone to kick-start the New Year's Resolution with these must-have eReadings

Aussie favourite Markus Zusak placed second with his bestselling novel The Book Thief, but it was Veronica Roth’s futuristic Divergent series that took out three spots in the top ten.

As the book market becomes ever more international, many homegrown authors have successfully climbed the charts, including  Graeme Simsion and Liane Moriarty, who all took up multiple spots in Australia’s top 100 bestsellers.

Heading into 2015, more people manage to finish a book in January than in any other month of the year. New Year resolutions could be partly behind the result, which included self-improvement books and business books.
