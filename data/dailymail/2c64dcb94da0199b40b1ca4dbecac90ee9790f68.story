A three-year-old Collie who currently lives at a rescue centre is struggling to find a new home because potential owners are put off by his cross-eyes.

Rescue dog Dennis was given to the Dogs Trust branch in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, a month ago after his owner was no longer able to care for him.

He was born with a condition called strabismus which means his eyes are not correctly aligned and point in different directions.

Rescue dog Dennis, a three-year-old Collie, was given to the Dogs Trust branch in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, a month ago after his owner was no longer able to care for him. He has since been unable to find new owners

He was born with a condition called strabismus which means his eyes are not correctly aligned and point in different directions. Despite the condition not affecting his eyesight, potential owners are said to put off

Despite his condition, he has relatively good eyesight but it has hampered him in finding a new home as potential owners are put off because of his eyes.

Jane Hirons, support relations officer at the centre, said: 'We take in hundreds of dogs of all shapes and sizes but I have never seen anything quite like Dennis.

'Some people will overlook any dogs that have a slight health problem or appear different, and even with his striking good looks and fun personality Dennis is often passed by - possibly due to his unusual eyes.

'But he is such a cheeky character. He is an affectionate, fun loving boy who adores his carers and loves to be with other dogs.

'This energetic boy is looking for an active family, could live with children as young as six and must be rehomed with another dog.

'Dennis may not be winning any frisbee catching competitions any time soon but he is a super dog who will make a fantastic pet in the right home so we have everything crossed he will find it soon.'

Dennis has been described by staff at the rescue centre as a 'cheeky character' and 'fun loving boy'

The 'happy' dog is the first the rescue centre in Warwickshire has come across with the cross-eyed condition

Dennis's condition is not degenerative and does not cause him any problems.

Paula Boyden, Dogs Trust veterinary director, added: 'We rarely see a dog at our rehoming centres with this condition and Dennis is definitely the only cross-eyed Collie I have come across.

'Fortunately, Dennis is a happy dog and his new owner will not need to treat him differently from a fully sighted dog, though they do need to consider he may find it slightly harder to focus which can make it more difficult for him to catch a ball.'
