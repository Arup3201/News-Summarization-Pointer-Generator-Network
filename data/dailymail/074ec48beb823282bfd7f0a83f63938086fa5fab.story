Big Brother star Britney Haynes has made the heartbreaking announcement that her two-month-old daughter has been diagnosed with cancer.

The 26-year-old, who gave birth to her first child, Tilly, in July, revealed the devastating diagnosis on Facebook.

'On September 1st, we were among the daily 720 sets of parents to be absolutely devastated with a Childhood Cancer diagnosis,' she wrote. 'Please take the time to pray for all these children, our sweet baby included. We appreciate each and every one.'

Haynes, who became a fan favorite after competing on the reality television show in 2010 and 2012, did not provide any further details about the type of cancer her daughter is suffering from.

Amid skepticism that the reports were true, she tweeted a photo of Tilly over the weekend, adding: 'Thank you for all of the thoughts, wishes, and prayers for my precious girl. She's everything to me.'

Fans flocked to social networking sites to express their sympathies and to pass on their support.

Haynes, who married last year, gave birth to Tilly on July 13. The little girl was a 'happy, healthy, and amazing' 8 pounds, 3 ounces, Haynes wrote at the time.

Fellow Big Brother contestant Evel Dick Donato told fans the reports were true and that she had told him about the diagnosis before going public. He said he did not know the type of cancer.

Haynes, who is from Huntington, Arkansas, married her high school sweetheart, Ryan Godwin, in March 2012. They later moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma.

She appeared on Big Brother 12 in 2010 and placed 4th, before returning for Big Brother 14 as a coach on the show.

Even though she did not win the show, she is popular among viewers for her sense of humor during her Diary Room confessions.
