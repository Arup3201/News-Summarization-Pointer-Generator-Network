David Cameron has laid down a challenge to European leaders to demand they stump up 1billion euros to help tackle Ebola.

The Prime Minister said the spread of the deadly virus was the ‘biggest health problem for a generation’ - but that some leaders were not doing their bit.

He has written to Herman Van Rompuy, President of the European Council, to say Ebola should be placed on the agenda of next week’s Brussels summit.

Mr Cameron said the 1billion euros would pay for 2,000 health workers to fly out to the affected West African countries, to help stem the spread of the disease.

So far, the EU has raised less than half of that sum.

Britain, however, has already earmarked £125million to tackle Ebola - the largest sum in Europe and second in the world only to the US.

The Prime Minister brought up the need for a more concerted international response to the Ebola crisis at Asia-Europe Meeting, a summit of world leaders from the two continents, in Milan yesterday.

In the letter to Mr Van Rompuy and fellow leaders, the Prime Minister warned that ‘we need to act fast to contain and defeat this deadly virus’.

He wrote: ‘If we do not significantly step up our collective response now, the loss of life and damage to the political, economic and social fabric of the region will be substantial and the threat posed to our citizens will also grow.’

He set out an ambitious package of measures to be agreed at next week’s EU summit.

Top of the list is raising contributions from the EU and its member states up to 1billion euros in total.

This would help pay for 2,000 workers to go the region to tackle the disease, including 1,000 clinical staff, by the middle of November.

Mr Cameron said he also wanted to see increased co-ordination on screening at ports of entry to Europe, and better sharing of best practice on handling cases to help to reduce the risk of further transmission within the EU.

Britain is also proposing that the EU could help further reduce the transmission rate in West Africa by better co-ordination amongst member states to ensure weekly flights from Europe to Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia for frontline health staff.

We want to see a duty of care package for health workers at European run or funded facilities that would, in the case they become infected, guarantee treatment based on clinical advice to a European standard in country or medical evacuation.

Britain is also calling for better testing for ebola and further staffed labs.

Calling on European leaders to agree this package, the Prime Minister wrote: ‘The Ebola outbreak in West Africa is an issue that requires a substantial global response.

‘The rapid spread of the disease and recent cases outside the West African region demonstrate the magnitude of the task at hand.

‘I believe that much more must be done. The European Council next week provides us with the opportunity to commit to an ambitious package of support to help reduce the rate of transmission in West Africa, to reduce the risk of transmission within Europe, and to pledge long-term support to assist with recovery, resilience and stability in the region.

‘By co-ordinating our approach, I believe the EU and its member states can maximise the effectiveness of our response.’

Britain has set aside £125million to tackle Ebola - second highest after United States of America.

The UK is also working with the World Health Organisation to train more than 120 health workers a week, and to develop an Ebola training facility to train over 800 health workers a week.
