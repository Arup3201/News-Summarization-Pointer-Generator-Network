Once viewed as one of the country’s most boring politicians, this balding French finance minister is enjoying a popularity surge - thanks to his beautiful 25-year-old girlfriend.

Pierre Moscovici, 55, who has been with Marie-Charline Pacquot for five years, had feared that their three-decade age gap would result in him being seen as ‘the man in power abusing a young thing’.

But his relationship with the post-graduate philosophy student - who describes herself on Twitter as a ‘lover of… literature’ - has enhanced his image, and he admits she is his ‘lighthouse in a storm’.

Miss Pacquot spoke about their bond to French newspaper Le Pays, saying she had ‘always liked being surrounded by older people’ and that they enjoy going to restaurants and watching old films.

She also revealed her affection for their cat Hamlet, about whom she often tweets. In one post she said the cat had eaten her tax return - ‘eager to revive the economy through consumption’.

Miss Pacquot also said on Twitter that she was concerned about Moscovici’s sleepless nights for European Union negotiations, posting: ‘Why can’t they do their work in the EU before nightfall?’

She added, jokingly, that she only noticed their large age gap when Mr Moscovici talked about having attended a gig by The Who more than 40 years ago in 1972, reported The Sunday Times.

Miss Pacquot appears to have bonded with Mr Moscovici over a love of literature, with the student saying they could ‘talk about books all night long’ and ‘felt very close to each other straight away’.

She wanted to openly discuss their bond to avoid any negative publicity, following a number of emails she received that said Mr Moscovici was ‘hiding’ her, reported The Sunday Times.

It follows the scandal last year of when President François Hollande’s girlfriend Valerie Trierweiler tweeted support for a rival of his former partner Segolene Royal in a parliamentary election.

Ms Royal has never forgiven her love rival for having an affair with Mr Hollande behind her back.
