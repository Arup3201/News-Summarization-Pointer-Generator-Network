The BBC was facing calls last night to open an investigation into Sir Jimmy Savile’s alleged child abuse.

The broadcaster insisted it had conducted extensive searches of its files and had found no record of any allegations of misconduct by the presenter.

But, amid repeated claims that it was an ‘open secret’ about Mr Savile’s interest in young girls at the BBC, critics say the corporation must make renewed efforts to find out the truth, even if it was many years ago.

Damning: Critics say the BBC should open an investigation into Sir Jimmy Savile's alleged child abuse after claims it was an 'open secret' about his interest in young girls at the BBC

The controversy is heightened by the BBC’s decision to drop a Newsnight investigation into Savile.

Former Newsnight political editor Michael Crick, now at Channel 4 News, tweeted that the BBC should take immediate action.

‘Somebody in George Entwistle’s office should be preparing a very strong BBC apology statement over Savile right now and get it out at once,’ he said. ‘The BBC pulled the Newsnight expose on Savile last December.

'Big question is who knew what and when about what he did on BBC premises.’

Philip Davies – a Tory MP on the culture, media and sport select committee – said: ‘They should look at it and not be so complacent about what are such serious allegations. They should find out who was aware at what stage.’

Following the death of the Top Of The Pops presenter in October 2011, Newsnight contacted ten former pupils of Duncroft Approved School, near Staines, west London, who said they had been victims.

Programme chiefs decided the film could air only if it was established that police in Surrey had investigated the star.

He was interviewed under caution in 2007 but – because no charges were laid – the film was scrapped.

Journalists were told by the editor Peter Rippon that the programme could not be broadcast.

There is speculation about what other BBC executives knew about the report – and whether Mr Rippon was placed under any pressure.

The BBC had insisted it is ‘absolutely untrue’ that the report was dropped for anything other than editorial reasons, saying the story had not been substantiated.

To say otherwise was false and ‘very damaging’ to the corporation and individual staff, a spokesman said.

Lib Dem MP Adrian Sanders, who is also on the culture select committee, said the key issue was whether someone at the BBC had made a complaint: ‘That would be a game changer.’
