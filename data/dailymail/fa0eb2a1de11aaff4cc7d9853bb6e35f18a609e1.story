A budget-busting bride has bagged herself a £21,000 wedding of her dreams - but only had to spend £2,000 for it.

Savvy saver Katie Slaney, 32, from Bromley, Kent, was determined to have a lavish wedding but without the extortionate price tag so set about saving, making and borrowing for her dream day.

Beautiful bride Katie shunned a traditional horse and carriage - which can cost upwards of £1000 - for a £10 taxi to the church, and the entire wedding party then WALKED from the church to the reception.

The wedding reception in full swing: Katie was determined not to let the big day leave her in debt

Mother-of-two
 Katie, an analyst, is always keen to save money - especially after having
 her two young daughters, Ella, three, and Lotta, 15 months - and regularly 
uses discount codes and coupons for her weekly shop.

Katie
 was delighted when long-term partner 31-year-old Phil proposed - but 
she was adamant that she wouldn’t be spending the £21,427 average price 
tag to achieve her dream wedding.

Katie
 said: 'Phil and I have been together for ten years and have two young 
children and we hadn’t previously managed to find the time or money to 
get married.

'For
 us the marriage was the important part not spending thousands on a 
wedding, and we didn’t want to be in debt for four or five years trying
 to pay off one day.'

Katie managed to organise her whole wedding for a fraction of the cost the average bride would pay by calling in favours, shopping around, and using saving vouchers and coupons.

Katie spent hours in the run up to her wedding making handmade confetti from dried rose petals and wild flowers, which she picked with her children as well as making her own wedding cake - the NIGHT BEFORE the big day.

Katie’s beautiful cream lace dress was made to measure and cost Katie a cool £100, from an online retailer in China, where she also bought her £20 shoes.

She also cut costs by doing all of her hair and makeup herself.

She said: 'I know what I like and I didn’t want to splash out for someone else to do it.'

Guests walked to the local pubs for pork scratchings and a pint and then to the village hall for the wedding reception

'Money saving sites like Voucher Codes Pro became my saviour for finding all the best money off deals,' she said.

'I would browse the site each night to see what new offers were on - I managed to get all of our booze for just £100 by using discount codes and coupons.'

Katie managed to feed her 100 guests a beautiful afternoon tea for just £10 a head, after finding vintage catering company Greenwich Tea Party online.

Instead of the traditional champagne and canapes after the ceremony, Katie and Phil took their guests for a pint and a packet of pork scratchings on a pub crawl, with the 100-strong wedding party walking five minutes down the road to three local pubs before heading to the village hall.

The couple asked a friend to DJ at the wedding reception and Katie created a homemade photobooth - with wigs and accessories bought from the pound shop.

'I used Pinterest a lot for inspiration, as I still wanted it to be a classy event. All of the decorations were handmade, or recycled, including empty jam jars for the flowers on the tables.

'I went for a rustic vintage theme, which I just loved.'

After the wedding Katie and Phil enjoyed a relaxing honeymoon to the Isle of Wight for four days, paid for by donations from family and friends.

Katie said: 'I had imagined my wedding for a while but I can’t believe we actually managed to pull it off without breaking the bank.'

'The wedding was wonderful and absolutely the best day of my life and it was so much sweeter knowing we hadn’t spent money we didn’t have.'
