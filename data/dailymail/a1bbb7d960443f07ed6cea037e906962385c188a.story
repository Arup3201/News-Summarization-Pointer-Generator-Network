Robert, who lives in Manchester, was yesterday in a stable but critical condition at the hospital. No updates are being given on his condition at the request of his family. 

Speaking to the Evening Standard today, Ms Kavanagh said the couple had met in Manchester, where Nick, who was born in Leeds but grew up in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, went to university.

She said: 'He was kind, gentle, funny and so considerate. He had hundreds of friends in London, which we’ve called home since 2007.

'We have been on lots of adventures together overseas and had many more planned.

'Nick was a journalist and press officer. He was passionate about writing and was so intelligent. He loved music, especially hardcore and punk, and went to many gigs.'

She added that her husband had loved Shrewsbury Town Football Club and had travelled around the country to see them play.  

Nick edited A Short Fanzine About Rocking, which covered rock, punk and hardcore rock.

Today, members of the music community paid tribute to a man described as 'selfless'. 

Music writer Guy Manchester said he was not surprised the heroic man acted in such a 'selfless' fashion and that he was one of the 'warmest' men you could meet.

Mr Manchester, co-editor of the Louder Than War music website, said: 'It breaks our hearts to have to pass on the sad news that sometime contributor to these pages and erstwhile pillar of the hardcore community, Nick Mann, died yesterday in tragic circumstances attempting to save his brother's life.

'That Nick died in such a selfless fashion will come as no surprise to anyone who knew him.   

Tributes: Members of the music community remembered a dedicated promoter and critic of the rock and pubk scenes while Shrewsbury Town FC took to Twitter to celebrate a life-long supporter of the club

'He was one of the most passionate and warmest of individuals I've ever known, and a man who liked little more than having a beer, a chat with his mates and partaking in some (self-confessed) bad moshing.'

'Our thoughts go out to all Nick's nearest and dearest, his wife, family and close friends.'

Camden concert venue The Black Heart added to its Facebook page: 'The hardcore scene upstairs just took its biggest supporter back. RIP Nick Mann. The London music scene thanks you.' 

Hard-core rock and punk band Your Demise posted on Facebook: 'RIP Nick Mann, absolutely devastating news. Thoughts with his family. Tell your loved ones you love them.'

And Leeds-based record label Pinky Swear Records tweeted: 'RIP Nick Mann @ashortfanzine - cheers for supporting our bands and label.'

Hours before the tragedy – just after midnight on Saturday night – Nick took a selfie with his brother after watching Shrewsbury Town beat Portsmouth in a League Two game.

Shrewsbury Town FC said in a statement: 'The football club was saddened to hear the tragic news that lifelong supporter Nick Mann was killed early on Sunday morning in London.

'Nick followed Shrewsbury Town home and away even though he was based in London. His passions were football and music and he was much loved by everyone who met him.

'He had made the trip down to Portsmouth on Saturday and tweeted after the match that it had been one of his favourite away days of the season.

'Social media has been full of tributes to Nick from fellow Town fans and from supporters far and wide.'

A picture of Nick will be shown on the scoreboard during Shrewsbury’s home game with Dagenham & Redbridge on Good Friday. 

Friends yesterday paid tribute to former Manchester University student Nick, who they said 'would have done anything for anyone'.

One friend, who did not want to be named, told the Evening Standard: 'The fact that Nick passed away while saving his brother is the least surprising thing in all of this.

Ambulance on the scene: Police  said that on arrival officers discovered two men with serious injuries

'He had all the time in the world for anyone, and gave so much to everything he had passion for. He loved two things in equal measure – music and football. He was one of the most passionate people I've ever known. He was a great dude.'

Josh Retallick, who had known Nick for eight years, said: 'It was such a heroic act. I just hope his brother recovers.'

Eyewitnesses said the pair were hit by a train as Nick desperately tried to pull his younger brother, who studied history at Manchester Metropolitan University, on to the platform.

A Tube worker said: 'The man dropped something down on to the track, a mobile phone or something, and then somehow he's got into trouble down there.

'This other person then tried to help him out and pull him up back on to the platform in time before the train came, but it wasn't in time and they both got hit. It was pretty bad.'

Another said: 'It happened at the back of the platform, just as the train pulls in, so maybe they didn't realise how close the train was.'

British Transport Police described the incident as a 'tragic accident'.
