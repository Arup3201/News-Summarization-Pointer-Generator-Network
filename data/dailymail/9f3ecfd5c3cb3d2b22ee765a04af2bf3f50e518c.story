A lawyer who was by the side of Corporal Nathan Cirillo in his final moments after being fatally shot has described the outpouring of love, support and aide she and other strangers used to try and keep the young man alive.

Barbara Winters was on her way to a meeting on Wednesday morning when she passed the National War Memorial, stopping to take a few photos of the guards on duty before heading off on her way.

Seconds later, she heard four shots and, knowing exactly what had happened, ran not away from the noise but back towards the Memorial and Cirillo.

Saint of a stranger: Barbara Winters (above in black) has described the final moments of Corporal Nathan Cirillo's life, and the five strangers who worked to save him

Helping hand: Winters (above), a lawyer, had just passed the National War Memorial when Cirillo was shot, and immediately ran back to help

Winters said she had an instinctive feeling that the guards had been targeted.

With four people already laying over the solider, and doing everything they could to help him, Winters also got involved.

A nurse on her way to work, Margaret Lerhe, and another solider who was on guard were busy applying pressure to his wounds so as to stop his bleeding.

A fellow passerby was working to elevate the 24-year-old's feet while a fellow corporal was by his head talking to him.

'You’re doing good, you’re doing good, buddy,' he told Cirillo. 

'You’re breathing - keep breathing.'

Winters, who was recounting her story for The Globe and Mail, she got down, loosened the solider's tie, said a prayer, and also began speaking to the brave young corporal, telling him, 'You’re a good man, you’re a brave man.'

He soon stopped breathing and lost his pulse, but the team of five strangers kept doing everything they could for Cirillo.

They started compressions and lifted his legs higher and alternated giving the man CPR.

And Winters kept on talking.

'You are loved. Your family loves you. You’re a good man,' she told him.

'Your family loves you. Your parents are so proud of you. Your military family loves you. All the people here, we’re working so hard for you. Everybody loves you.'

Unfortunately her words, and the hard work of the five strangers, could not save Cirillo.

He died in their arms as paramedics arrived and began to work on him.

Lerhe, who actually watched the entire horrifying incident go down, says she did not even believe it was real at first.

'I thought, "It stands to reason, they're having a drill,"' she told CBC. 

'Then I thought, "They're having a theater piece," because the shooter, with his long gun, it was so incongruous. It didn't look real at all.'

Hero: Margaret Lerhe (above) was also on the scene helping Cirillo 

Then, she saw the shooter fire, and rushed into action.

Just don't call her a hero. 

'There were four or five people around this fallen soldier working as a team. I'm uncomfortable with the term hero. It was everybody focused on him.'
