Last month, the EPA accused Johnson, who lives in Fort Bridger, a tiny town of just 345 people in the southwestern part of the state, of violating the Clean Water Act for damming up a creek and polluting water by building his pond.

Johnson, who works as a welder, built the pond five years ago, but he says, got permission to do so, including the right the dam up the Six Mile Creek, from Wyoming state agencies. However, the EPA says he violated the Clean Water Act since he built a dam and failed to get approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

Johnson, however, contends the EPA is applying the law incorrectly as he built a stock pond, which should make it exempt.

'I think they’re trying to gain jurisdiction,' Johnson told the Deseret News. 'They’re trying to see if they can run over me, and then they will get into everyone’s irrigation ditch and stock ponds throughout not only Wyoming, but the United States.'

A Wyoming State Engineer’s Office letter from 2012 appears to back up Johnson's claim that he is not running foul of the law. 'Said permit is in good standing and is entitled to be exercised exactly as permitted,' the letter reads, according to FoxNews.com.

Although he received state approval, the EPA contends he failed to get the blessing of federal authorities who have the ultimate say.

In addition, the EPA says that because Six Mile Creek is tributary of the Blacks Fork River, which itself a tributary of the Green River, it is part of the 'waters of the United States.' Therefore, it falls under federal jurisdiction and the Clean Water Act.

Johnson counters that's a stretch as water in the creek is spread out and almost never makes it the 100 miles from Fort Bridget to the Green River.

'The pond doesn't start in a river or end in a river,' he said.

The feds started getting on his case starting in 2012 after the Army Corps of Engineers inspected the pond and concluded the dam he made ended up leading 'dredged and fill material.'

Johnson has appealed to Wyoming's two Republican senators, John Barrasso and Mike Enzi for help. The pair wrote to the EPA on his behalf, but the agency is budging.

And Johnson isn't backing down either.

'I want to stand up for what I believe in, for what I’ve worked for,' he said. 'I feel like I’m entitled to that. I pay taxes, I live in this country and I’m going to fight it to the end'

The pond was built to stock fish which Johnson says exempts him from the Clean Water Act

The EPA says Johnson dammed up a creek that 100 miles away empties into a large river and therefore makes pond applicable to law
