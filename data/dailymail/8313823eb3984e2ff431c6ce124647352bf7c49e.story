A luxury cruise liner with up to 450 passengers on board was prevented from leaving an Argentine port today in a protest over the Falkland Islands.

The Seabourn Sojourn was blocked in by Argentine port workers who want to prevent the ship sailing to the disputed islands.

The vessel was later allowed to leave the port at Buenos Aires following a delay of seven hours.

Union leaders were demanding that the liner's captain pledges not to visit the Falklands before being allowed to set sail.

The vessel, with 330 crew, was due to 
set off yesterday at 5pm local time on a 15-day cruise around Patagonia,
 visiting the Falkland Islands and ending up in Valparaiso, Chile.

The company's UK marketing director Carly Perkins said there were a 'significant number' of British passengers on board but could not give a figure.

She said: 'The ship has been able to resume its schedule. It was delayed but it has now left Buenos Aires.'

Passengers paid between £4,200 and £9,300 each for the trip, depending on their choice of cabin.

The ship was scheduled to make an eight-hour stop at the Falklands' capital Port Stanley.

Passengers are offered a four-hour tour around the battlefields from the 1982 War, including Mount Tumbledown and Mount Longdon, scenes of some of the fiercest fighting.

Workers from the United Maritime Workers Union (SOMU) prevented the Seabourn Sojourn from leaving the port in Buenos Aires.

They had the backing of the radical Malvinas Resistance group, which demands the return of the islands, known as Las Malvinas in South America, to Argentina.

Tony Lopez, spokesman for the group, said the ship would not be allowed to set sail until it had confirmed it would not sail to the archipelago, 300 miles off the coast of Argentina.

He described the cruise liner as 'a pirate ship' and said the ship would be violating the 
Gaucho Rivero law, designed to stop British ships from 'plundering' 
Argentine resources in the area.

The incident began a day after Argentina's ambassador to the UK, Alicia Castro, was summed to the Foreign Office to answer allegations of harassment to British ships and shipping companies.

FCO defence and intelligence director, Robert Hannigan, called the ambassador in after masked men raided the Buenos Aires offices of a company offering cruises to the Falklands on November 19.

The Foreign Office described the raid as 'a violent act of intimidation'.

Ms Castro, a former air stewardess, was said to have been 'very cross' at the Foreign Office for 'wasting her time'.

Last April she angered Foreign Secretary William Hague by hijacking a meeting on human rights to repeatedly ask him about the Falklands dispute.

The Seabourn Sojourn was launched in the River Thames in June 2010 by the model, actress and singer Twiggy.

The ship, which boasts 225 cabins spread over eight decks, a casino and two swimming pools, is owned by US company Seabourn. It was not clear how many Britons were on board.

A spokeswoman for the company in London was unable to give an immediate comment.

In February Argentine officials refused to allow three cruise ships to dock in the southern port city of Ushuaia following a protest by war veterans.

Tourism chiefs in the area accused the officials of 'economic suicide' at the time.

The Gaucho Rivero law, passed last August, was named after an Argentine worker who led a 1833 mutiny against the British in the Falklands.

It was only expected to be used against British military vessels and those involved in fishing and oil exploration.
