Disney Infinity really is something special. Not only does it succeed in
 offering unparalleled levels of creative choice but it's a wonderful 
homage to some of their much-loved characters.

Using a similar mechanic to the Skylanders 
games, an Infinity Base is plugged into the console and figurines are 
placed on one of three slots. As with Skylanders, they are rigid and 
can't be moved - but the attention to detail is astounding.

In the 
Starter Pack, you get Sulley, Captain Jack Sparrow and Mr Incredible and 
all ooze the charm that made them such favourites with fans. Even 
Sparrow, arguably the hardest of the three to capture given he was 
played by Johnny Depp and not a CGI concoction, exudes that clumsy, 
cocky swagger. It's a shame that the voice actor doesn't quite nail him 
as a character.

Out of this world: Infinity is at its best in Toy Box mode, where all your favourite characters can interact

After the magical introduction, the game is split 
into two areas - the Toy Box mode and The Play Sets. The latter 
represents Infinity's character specific campaign mode - but don't 
expect a bunch tedious mini games.

Each character's story lasts for 
around 4 hours and ranges from battles on the high sea with Jack Sparrow
 to open-world robot smashing with Mr Incredible in 
Metroville. But it's Sulley's Monsters University that steals the show - a
 stealth action game where you have to wreck havoc on the rival campus 
Fear Tech.

Combat is helped along by responsive controls, even though when 
you're knocked down, getting back up again is a tad slow. In a way, it's
 a shame characters from other universes can't join in on the fun - but it's 
understandable, given how true to the source material Disney want to be.

Fear
 not, though, as the Toy Box mode goes some way to resolve this. Not 
only can you build new worlds, but you can design your own games, too. 
Want to race a custom car around Cinderella's Castle as Jack Sparrow? 
You can. And Infinity's clever tutorial system makes the process as easy as 
possible.

There's even a clever magic wand that let's you manipulate 
the environment on the fly - literally allowing you to move 
mountains at the touch of a button.

Fitting, given that Infinity has carved its own, beautiful mark on the gaming landscape.Critics
 will point out that some classic characters - such as Donald Duck - 
should be included.

Magical: Graphics may not push consoles, but they capture the essence of each world and character perfectly

Regardless, Infinity remains a magical experience for children and 
adults alike, and an enjoyable celebration of their more contemporary creations.

Disney Infinity is out now.
