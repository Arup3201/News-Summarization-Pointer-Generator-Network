Dead: Katie Ann Jenkins, 23, was charged with murdering Richard Craddock (pictured), 51

A 23-year-old woman passenger was today charged with murdering a driver by stabbing him in the neck as he drove along a busy main road.

Katie Ann Jenkins was accused of murdering Richard Craddock, 51, who was found dying in a pool of blood on a road in Gowerton, near Swansea, south Wales, with a single stab wound.

Jenkins, of Waunarlwydd, was remanded in custody after the death of businessman Mr Craddock, of Sandfields. Police today appealed for help from late-night revellers who saw the alleged stabbing in the village.

South Wales Police Detective Superintendent Huw Lewis said: ‘We believe the incident happened while both people were seated in a silver Ford Fusion vehicle.

‘Mr Craddock received a single stab wound resulting in a fatal injury. Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time and we are continuing to support them.

‘This incident occurred on a busy main road, in an area where there are a number of both residential and commercial properties.

‘I am appealing directly to any person who may have information no matter how small or insignificant they may think it is to contact the incident room.’

Scene: Mr Craddock managed to stagger out of the car but collapsed in the road where he was found

Mr Craddock managed to stagger out of the car but collapsed in the road where he was found by a passer-by. His family laid flowers at the roadside where he was found in the early hours of Saturday.

A statement released by Mr Craddock’s mother said: ‘We would like to thank all those people who came to help Richard and would ask for privacy to grieve at this very difficult time.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
