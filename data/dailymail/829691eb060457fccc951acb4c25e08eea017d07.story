The United Nations has admitted that its headline-grabbing announcement that one billion people in the world were going hungry was wrong and the number is actually significantly less.

The UN Food and Agriculture 
Organisation made headlines in 2009 when it announced that one billion people — one sixth of the world’s population — were undernourished.

But it now places the figure at closer to 870 million after admitting the original projection was incorrect because of flawed methodology and poor data.

It now claims to use a much more accurate set of parameters 
and statistics to calculate its annual estimate of the world’s hungry.

FAO decided to set the record straight about the number of the world’s undernourished people, applying the more accurate data retroactively to 1990, in its 2012 state of food insecurity report released on Tuesday.

And according to the report, the number of hungry people has actually been declining steadily — rather than increasing — over the past two decades.

But it added progress has slowed since the 2007-2008 food crises and the global economic downturn.

FAO director-general Jose Graziano da Silva said: 'We have good news, we have made some progress in reducing hunger.'

The organisation argues that positive action taken now to boost economic growth and invest in agriculture, particularly in poor countries, could reduce the world's hungry by one-half by 2015.

The report stated: ‘In today’s world of unprecedented technical and economic opportunities, we find it entirely unacceptable that more than 100 million children under the age of five are underweight, and are therefore unable to realize their full socio-economic and human potential.'

The group of Eight pledged $20billion for seeds, fertilizers and tools in 2009 to help prevent rising numbers of undernourished people

The FAOs announcement in 2009 sparked a high-level summit including the pope and the UN chief went on a daylong hunger strike to show solidarity with the one billion.

The Group of Eight devoted much of its summit that year to pledging $20 billion for seeds, fertilizers and tools to help poor nations feed themselves.

But the projections were off because they were calculated using figures from non-UN sources that were fed into the UN’s number-crunching model.

Jomo Kwame Sundaram, FAO’s assistant director-general for economic and social development, said: 'There was considerable fear that that
combination of lower incomes and higher prices was going to cause 
significant undernourishment.

'No one really knows for sure if at any particular period whether that one billion figure was actually reached or not.'

He said the goal of the state of food insecurity report is to assess chronic hunger over time, rather than spikes caused by temporary food shortages and price hikes.

He added that the UN couldn’t predict how well governments would respond to the crises to protect their poorest and whether individual families would make sacrifices to make sure they had enough food on the table.

Going to waste: One third of all food produced is wasted along the distribution line

Pietro Gennari, the statistics director for the FAO’s economic and social development department, added: 'So it was in a way a mistake, an error, that we have made with many other organizations at the time.'

FAO officials said the new number of 870 million hungry people for 2012 was based on revised figures from 1990.

They calculated this using new population data from the UN Population Fund.

China’s population estimate for the 1990s, for example, has been revised upward by some 25 million people, whereas Bangladesh’s population has been revised downwards by 17 million people.

That affects hunger statistics because food production figures are divided by population figures and estimates of food loss at the retail level.

Previously, FAO considered the amount of food produced as the amount of food available to feed the world.

The agency didn’t take into account that one third of all food produced is wasted along the distribution chain, either because it spoils, is eaten by rodents or is otherwise inedible.

The 2012 survey takes into account these losses.
