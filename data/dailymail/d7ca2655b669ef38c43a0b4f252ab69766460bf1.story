What will they think of next?

Students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a tangible display platform that allows users to touch things through their computer screens.

Daniel Leithinger and Sean Follmer, PhD candidates at the MIT Media Lab in Boston, are the creators behind inFORM, a machine that uses a camera feed to turn things into 3D objects in real time.

It works just like a pin-screen toy - as in the kind you find in museum novelty shops - except that under each pin is a motor that reacts to a ‘kinect’ depth-sensing camera made by Microsoft, which is usually used in games, according to CNN.

The camera is able to capture depth data and transmits it to the table, which then forms a physical object.

What we can expect in the future? A demonstrator shows how, by using camera footage of his hands, he is able to pick up a ball using the inFORM grid

Remember these? The inFORM grid uses the same principles as an old-school pin board toy, however instead of a physical touch, it just needs a camera feed, which the machine then mimics. Pictured is one of the inFORM creators, Daniel Leithinger

The MIT students who created the screen say it is only very early days in the technology, with the grid pins only able to move up and down to form an object

Essentially inFORM is just mimicking what the camera sees, thanks to a grid of 900 columns arranged in a 30 by 30 grid, which adjusts in height based on the image it receives.

Follmer said the idea was borne out of frustrations with modern touch-screen technology.

'If you think about things like Skype or video conferencing tools, it misses out on some of the ways we naturally interact,' he told ABC News.

'Things like hand gestures can be lost when you're collaborating at a distance.'

The pair hope the idea will one day apply to smart phones, rendering buttons and menus when they are needed.

'We see a need for displays to become more physical again,' said Leithinger.

The next step: It is hoped the technology will one day apply to phones, with the device being able to become another object and create buttons for users

Developers use a ball to show how physical the inFORM machine becomes when forming an object

'This could make future smartphones and tablets much more intuitive and satisfying to use.'

The team has already attracted the attention of several businesses, 'musicians who want to create new musical instruments, or people who want to make an interface for blind users', according to the South China Morning Post.

'It’s inspiring people and we’re glad so many ideas are coming in,' Leithinger said.

However there is a long way to go until inFORM is a consumer product, with its creators acknowledges these are very early days.

'In the future, more and more devices will be able to change their shape,' Follmer said.

'I envision a future where a device changes shape to better interact with its owner.'
