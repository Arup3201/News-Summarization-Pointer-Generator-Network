From Miranda Kerr and Gisele Bundchen to Hilaria Baldwin, celebrity yoga selfies have become as commonplace as controversial tweets and paparazzi upskirt shots.

But this new cultural stalwart is drawing ire from the yoga community, which claims that these celebrity yoga snaps are nothing more than a publicity stunt and do little to promote the ideals of the ancient practice.

Jennilyn Carson, a New York-based yogi who runs a site called Yoga-Dork, told the New York Post: ‘In a sense it mocks what yoga is.’

Dangerous message? Hilaria Baldwin posted this controversial image on Instagram on Friday afternoon, writing: 'My intention is to promote health and encourage you to care for your body. #yogapostureoftheday'

One of the most prolific celebrities to 
post selfies in complicated poses is Hilaria Baldwin. The 29-year-old 
worked as an instructor for the NYC-based studio Yoga Vida before 
exchanging community classes for a marriage to actor Alec Baldwin.

But
 that hasn’t stopped the pint-sized mother-of-one from continuing her 
practice in public. In fact, her ‘365 Days of Yoga Craziness’ campaign –
 a series of Instagrams showing her posing in awkward locations such as 
the aisle of a plane – has helped cement her status as a yoga 
personality.

These images, 
which routinely accrue thousands of ‘likes’ on her Instagram account, have been called out by 
more serious practitioners for subverting the original intentions of a 
yoga practice: Humility, privacy, and a search for the truest self.

In
 posting a photo and inadvertently seeking followers’ fanfare, the likes
 of Ms Carson believe that celebrities negate yoga’s original purpose.

Mrs
 Baldwin has spoken out in defence of her yoga photos, arguing that such
 'harsh judgments' make for the most un-yogic behavior possible.

She
 wrote on Twitter: 'True yogis dont make harsh judgements. So my advice 
to the haters: get on your yoga mat & breath & feel, until you 
make peace with diversity. [sic]'

Mrs Baldwin, however, is not alone in fielding criticism from the yoga community.

Photos
 from supermodel Gisele Bundchen’s Instagram account often show the 
leggy Brazilian striking an asana by the beach, by the pool, or in her 
at-home yoga studio alongside one-year-old daughter Vivian.

But they too, have received little love.

‘The
 discussion has been evolving over time since Instagram began,’ Ms 
Carson says. ‘There’s a sentiment [among the yoga community] that 
they’re doing a disservice to yoga by putting these pictures out there. 
It’s showy and basically everything that the practice is not supposed to
 be about — “Look at me and these awesome poses I can do!”’

Potential for injury: Yogis worry that fans of celebrities like Naomi Campbell (pictured) may feel prompted to strike an urdhva dhanurasana like hers without proper training - which could lead to injury

Stairway to enlightenment? Some experts say that Hilaria Baldwin's Instagram yoga poses are nothing more than a publicity stunt

Unreal bodies: Yoga selfies, like this one from Lady Gaga, are being accused by some as promoting anti yogic principles

But
 even more detrimental, according to yoga critics, is how celebrity 
images – especially those depicting especially advanced poses – have the
 potential to lead to fan injury.

‘I
 worry about people getting hurt because they think, “I want to get into
 that pose,”’ Kay Kay Clivio, the lead teacher trainer at NYC’s Pure 
Yoga.
