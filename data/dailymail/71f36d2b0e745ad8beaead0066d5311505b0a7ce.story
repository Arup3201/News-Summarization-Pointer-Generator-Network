With Hurricane Irene bearing down on the East Coast, thousands of people face fleeing their homes.

But, as ever, there is one group of intrepid individuals heading straight for eye of the storm - the weathermen.

As a reminder to us all, TV stations and blogs have compiled a series of clips which remind us that the job of forecasting the weather can have dangers of its own.

Unfortunate location: Hurricane Wilma forced Jeff Morrow to his knees as he attempted to report from Miami in October 2005, for the Weather Channel

On NBC’s Morning Joe, viewers were shown a highlight reel of bloopers, clangers and mistakes which showed how even seasoned weather reporters are not immune from on-air issues.

One of the clips shows an unidentified weatherman swear live on air when some lightning flashes across the sky.

‘Son of a...!’ he says, oblivious to the fact he is still on camera. ‘Did you see that?’

In other footage a weather girl shrieks when her cap is blown off and runs after it whilst still on air.

Fail: NBC's Al Roker fell over in 2005 during severe gusts from Hurricane Wilma in Naples, Florida, despite a colleague grabbing his legs to keep him steady

Almost blown away: This weather reporter in Columbia River Gorge struggles to hold onto her thermal hat as she is battered by strong winds

And another clip shows a weather girl being held up by a colleague as wind batters them both.

She tells viewers: ‘It’s just painful’ - before they are both swept away.

Among the most famous weather ‘fails’ is that of NBC’s Al Roker, who fell over on camera due to high winds.

In a clip from 2005 he at first seems to be coping with the gusts from Hurricane Wilma in Naples, Florida with the aid of a colleague grabbing his legs to keep him steady.

Hats off: This reporter in Palm Springs remarks about a fallen traffic light before she loses her hat and hilariously runs after it with her back to the camera

Sea breeze: This reporter amazingly escapes unharmed while there is debris blowing all around him as he reports on Hurricane Ike

But moments into the broadcast he slips up and falls on his side.

‘We’re OK, we’re OK,’ he said as he hauled himself indoors with a grin on his face.

The year before Mr Roker already assured his place in the weatherman hall of fame when he apparently stumbled across a reporter making a live broadcast in West Palm Beach, Florida, and decided to lend him a hand.

The footage shows The Weather Channel’s Mike Siedel being held up by Mr Roker as the two lean into the 70mph wind - and get rather too close for comfort.

Toppled: During Hurricane Ike in 2008, a Weather Channel anchor was swept by a gust of wind into bushes while he was delivering a report

'Hurricane hug': NBC's Al Roker helped Weather Channel reporter Mike Seidel in need of assistance in 2004 in West Palm Beach, Florida

‘You know I’m glad you showered this morning, Al’ said Mr Siedel. ‘You know, we ought to just lay down.'

In another clip from 2008 a Weather Channel reporter was blown into a shrub mid-broadcast.

The hilarious footage shows the the man tumble onto his side and land in a bush due to the force of Hurricane Ike.

With admirable dedication to the cause he says into his microphone: ‘Hold on’ as he is upended and thrown onto a plant.

Test run: ABC's Good Morning America decided to show viewers how 130mph winds really feel on a person, with an experiment at the University of Maryland

He then gets up and resumes his broadcast as if nothing had happened, saying: ‘Alright, sorry about that, that was a heck of a gust’.

Veteran weatherman Jeff Morrow also fell victim to Hurricane Wilma in 2005 which left him barely able to move.

‘Woah! Very hard to stand,’ he says in the footage, which has been posted on YouTube.

He adds: ‘Just the power of the hurricane’ as he is forced to bend at a 45 degree angle to stand up.

‘Wow, that’s some of the strongest wind I’ve ever had to stand in’.
