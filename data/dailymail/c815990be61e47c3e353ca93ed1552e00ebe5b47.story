The son of the late Hollywood actor Dennis Hopper has been accused of raping a 15-year-old girl.

A lawsuit alleges Henry Hopper raped the teenager after plying her with drugs and alcohol.

According to papers the 21-year-old actor is being sued by the mother of the 
unidentified girl, TMZ website reports.

Claims: Henry Hopper with his late father actor Dennis Hopper in 2009. The 21-year-old has been accused of raping a 15-year-old girl

It claims the girl - identified in the lawsuit as Jan Doe - met Hopper through
 a mutual friend in February last year.

The legal papers claim that the pair communicated using social networking site Facebook.

It claims that in the months that followed, Hopper 
invited the teenager to his home in Venice, CA on several occasions by luring her with drugs and alcohol.

TMZ reported that in the suit Doe claims that Hopper would 
wait until she was intoxicated and 'engaged in sexually offensive 
conduct with her.'

These include two allegations of serious sexual assaults.

It's unclear if Doe ever reported the allegations to police.

In the suit, Doe’s lawyer claims the actor ‘preyed upon a young impressionable child, suggesting that he cared for her, luring her into his home with promises of alcohol and illegal drugs, and then repeatedly taking advantage of her youth an vulnerability.’

Doe's mother is suing for unspecified damages, claiming her daughter suffered significant injuries 
to her emotional health, strength and activity.

She claims as a result the teenager was required to receive treatment with several mental health care professionals.
