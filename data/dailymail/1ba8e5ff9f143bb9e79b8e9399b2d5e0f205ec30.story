The price of a first class stamp will jump higher over the next three years

The price of a first class stamp, which has rocketed to 60p, will jump higher over the next three years it emerged last night.

According to details buried in the Royal Mail’s prospectus, the newly privatised company still plans further price rises.

This is despite the fact it admits the ‘substantial’ price increase from 46p to 60p in April 2012 did trigger a drop in the number of letters sent.

The price shock comes after strict rules – which used to control Royal Mail’s ability to increase prices – were scrapped before the stock market float.

The move was one of many changes, which also included allowing the company to dump a £12billion pension black hole on the taxpayer, that were made to prepare Royal Mail for a sell-off.

As a result there is now no official limit on how much the former state monopoly can raise stamp prices, or a cap on how many times they can be increased each year.

The only protection around stamps is the price of a second-class stamp, which costs 50p.

Under rules, laid down by the regulator Ofcom, the maximum price which Royal Mail can charge for a second-class stamp is currently 56p.

In its prospectus, Royal Mail said directors ‘expect any price increase to be broadly in line with RPI over the three financial years ended in 2016’. RPI is the retail prices index measure of inflation, typically higher than the more commonly used consumer prices index.

For example figures published yesterday by the Office for National Statistics show RPI is 3.2 per cent, but CPI is only 2.7 per cent.

Official forecasts, from the independent watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility, show RPI is predicted to be 2.8 per cent in 2014, 3.2 per cent in 2015 and 3.6 per cent in 2016.

If correct, the price of a first-class stamp could hit 66p over the next three years.

Royal Mail chief executive Moya Greene said the company has to be ‘very careful about pricing’.

She added: ‘I don’t think you’re going to see a company that is going to be senseless about the pricing lever.’

Miss Greene said Britain is in the ‘low to middle of the spectrum’ compared to stamp prices in the rest of the European Union and insisted Royal Mail must ‘retain the loyalty of our customer base’.

Yesterday the Greetings Card Association said stamps are ‘really good value’ but it would ‘not be happy’ to see large increases.

Last year’s price hike caused such furore that Royal Mail agreed to allow millions on benefits to buy stamps at the old price last Christmas.

In another bid to pacify concerns, Royal Mail did not increase stamp prices in April this year.
