Nigel Parsons outside court today after he was 
caught filming women with a hidden iPhone in a bathroom at work

A finance boss, who hid an iPhone in work showers to film female colleagues undressing, faces jail.

Nigel Parsons, 34, set up the handset in a bathroom at top investment firm Bestinvest in Chesterfield Gardens, Mayfair to record footage of workmates in February this year.

The portfolio manager also admitted making or possessing 61 indecent photographs and distributing one image of children between four and ten-years-old, at Southwark Crown Court today.

Parsons, of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, was found out when a work colleague spotted the iPhone and found recordings of herself and a number of other co-workers as they showered naked.

He was identified because there was footage of him setting up and adjusting the phone.

Parsons today pleaded guilty to two counts of voyeurism after two recordings were made between February 17 and 21 this year.

Parsons was released on bail today but was warned by Judge Michael Grieve QC: ‘These are serious offences and you will have to accept that custodial sentences are an extremely likely outcome.’

Prosecutor Peter Zinner said of the indecent photographs of children: ‘The making of indecent photographs was for downloading images from the internet.

‘The age range of the children depicted is between four and ten-years-old.’

Parsons resigned from Bestinvest in February after the allegations surfaced. He will be sentenced on January 8 next year.

A spokesman for Bestinvest said: ‘Nigel Parsons was a portfolio manager in the investment management team at Bestinvest. He resigned from his employment at Bestinvest in February 2012 following an allegation of serious gross misconduct relating to his personal behaviour.

'This was also reported to the police by the individuals concerned.

'The company has been supportive of 
staff who were affected by Mr Parsons’ unacceptable actions and the 
police with their investigation.’

Suspected voyeur: Neil Riley was found dead at his home after he was questioned on claims he set up hidden cameras in a bedroom to spy on female colleagues

Bestinvest ‘is one of the 
fastest-growing private client advisory firms’ and has won several 
awards including UK Wealth Manager of the Year 2011, according to its 
website.

The case comes as a male nurse at one 
Britain’s most prestigious Catholic boarding schools has been found 
hanged after he was accused of being a peeping Tom.

Neil
Riley, 54, had been arrested on suspicion of voyeurism after claims he 
set up hidden cameras in a bedroom to spy on female colleagues.

Staff at Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, where boarding school fees cost up to £28,443 per year, called police after it was believed four women had been secretly filmed.

Mr Riley was later questioned and released on bail but five days later he was found dead at his home in Great Harwood, Blackburn, following concerns for his welfare.

Lancashire Police today said inquiries were still ongoing into whether any offences had been committed against the staff.

A Peeping Tom became the first pervert to be banned from every McDonald’s in England and Wales after he was caught spying on two women in the restaurant’s toilets earlier this year.

Sukhbir Singh, 32, sneaked into the ladies’ toilets at a branch of the fast food giant in Birmingham city centre where he hid in the cubicles and watched the women in February this year.

He was also given a six-month conditional discharge and handed a 12-month community order.
