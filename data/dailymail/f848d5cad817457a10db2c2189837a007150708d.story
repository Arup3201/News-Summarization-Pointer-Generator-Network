'Endangered patients': Janice Harry, pictured last year at a hearing, has been struck off the nursing register

The former chief nurse at the centre of the Mid Staffs scandal has been struck off after it was found she endangered patients.

Janice Harry, 60, was head of nursing at Stafford Hospital  during the years of the Mid Staffs scandal, in which 1,200 patients died needlessly.

While in charge she made harsh cuts that reduced the number of nurses to dangerous levels.

She also refused to adequately staff the A&E department, ignored warnings that patients were at risk and did not provide proper food and fluids for patients on the Emergency Admission Unit.

Harry put patients in danger and failed in her role as chief nurse, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) had heard.

A panel last year was also told of her aggressive management style, which led her to brand a staff member a 'waste of space' in front of a colleague.

She had been let off with a five-year caution last November - even though the NMC ruled that she failed to act as a 'voice for nurses.'

Today Harry, who has retired from nursing, agreed that she should be struck off after negotiations with the watchdog. She can now no longer work as a nurse in the UK.

Jackie Smith, chief executive of the Nursing and Midwifery Council said: 'We are pleased to confirm a legal agreement has been reached between the NMC, Professional Standards Authority (PSA) and Janice Harry, which will lead to her being struck off the nursing register.

'We had previously raised concerns about the sanction imposed by an independent panel in November 2013, and took immediate steps to refer it to the PSA for review.

'The case raised important issues about the responsibility of nurses who hold senior management positions and their duty to ensure the protection of the public.'

During the NMC hearing it emerged Harry asked whether patients were 'going to heaven soon' to see whether beds were likely to become free, shooting down staff with sarcastic retorts if they complained.

The misconduct panel had found Harry guilty of exposing patients to 'risk' and 'danger' while she was in charge of nursing at the hospital from 1998 to 2006.

She denied the charges against her, but was eventually cautioned for her behaviour.

Joanna Harvey, a ward manager, described Harry as 'a bully' who would intimidate staff with aggressive and sarcastic comments.

Janice Harry acted in an 'aggressive and intimidating' way and shouted at staff who raised problems with her, reducing some to tears, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) heard

She said staff tried to avoid meetings her, in which she often brought nurses to tears for making mistakes and missing targets.

'If anyone tried to express their opinion in these meetings, Jan would jump down their throat', she said.

'There were also concerns about patient safety, but Jan wouldn't listen.'

Ms Harvey added that standards at the hospital plummeted when cuts of Â£10million were imposed by the Government.

She said: 'Patient care had been significantly compromised, and a very stressful atmosphere had been created. Patients were left feeling uncomfortable, unpleasant, and cold - their dignity was not maintained.'

A public inquiry led by Sir Robert Francis QC concluded as many as 1,200 patients may have died unnecessarily at the hospital between 2005 and 2008.

Harry was employed by Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust and its predecessor Mid Staffordshire General Hospitals NHS Trust between 1998 and 2006, the NMC was told. She denies the charges against her

William Davis, for the NMC, said Harry presided over an 'unacceptable decline in the standards of nursing care offered' at the hospital.

'She wholly failed to ensure appropriate staffing levels, and the correct skill mix', he said.

'Whilst the registrant was not directly responsible for the provision of care she did have corporate responsibility for determining and monitoring the standards of care provided by nursing staff at the hospital.'She adopted an aggressive management style, which created an unpleasant atmosphere for staff.'Harry, previously a board member with the West Midlands Regional Health Authority and the Wolverhampton NHS Trust, left Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust in the summer of 2006.

She retired from professional practice three years later.

A total of 55 nurses and midwives from Stafford Hospital have been referred to the NMC over accusations of misconduct since February 2010.
