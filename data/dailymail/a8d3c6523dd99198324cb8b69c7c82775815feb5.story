Boris Johnson met Rupert Murdoch for a private dinner at the newspaper tycoon's Mayfair home, it has been claimed.  

The Mayor of London was joined by Homeland star Damian Lewis and a number of editors and executives at the event, sources told The Guardian.

The meeting on Tuesday is the second between the pair in the past six months.

Spokespeople for Rupert Murdoch, left, and Boris Johnson, right, refused to comment on the meeting

Old Etonian Lewis stars in the Homeland series made by Mr Murdoch's production company fox21.

A spokesman for the mayor's office said he could not comment on a 'private engagement'.

The office's stance has angered politicians who say the mayor should be transparent about who he sees.

Len Duvall, leader of the Labour group
at the London Assembly, told The Guardian it was 'ludicrous' that Mr Johnson believes he can meet Mr Murdoch in a private capacity.

Dinner date: Actor Damian Lewis, pictured at the 24th Annual Producers Guild Awards held at The Beverly Hilton Hotel with Helen McCrory, was also reported to have attended the dinner

He told the newspaper: 'He is the Mayor of London and has a duty to uphold the highest 
standards.

'Does he really think meeting for a private dinner with Rupert Murdoch is a normal meeting? What planet does he live on?'

The mayor is seen as a future 
challenger to David Cameron's leadership of the Conservatives party and 
the recent meeting will fuel speculation of a closer relationship 
between him and the media mogul.

Johnson was swamped by media at the Conservative Party Conference last year

Len Duvall, leader of the Labour group of the London Assembly, said Johnson should be transparent about his meetings

The pressure group Hacked Off, which is campaigning for new press laws, also criticised the mayor.

A spokesman told the MailOnline: 'After the revelations unearthed during Leveson, you might think that senior politicians had learned their lesson about holding secret assignations with newspaper bosses. Yet it appears that Boris Johnson just doesn't get it.

'It beggars belief that anyone could describe a dinner between the most powerful politician in London and the head of News Corporation, the company at the centre of the phone-hacking scandal, as a "private arrangement".

'The mayor is also the chairman of the Metropolitan Police Authority and it is totally inappropriate for him to be meeting Mr Murdoch in private while the Met are carrying out an investigation into Murdoch companies.

'We urge all politicians to comply with the Leveson recommendations and publish full and up-to-date accounts of their meetings with media proprietors and editors. Given their past record of excessive closeness, and all the harm it has done, that is the very least the public can expect from those who represent them.'

The alleged dinner is the second time the pair have met in recent months. 

Mr Johnson invited Mr Murdoch and his wife 
Wendi Deng to watch Rebecca Adlington in the 800m final during London 
2012 as his personal guests.

Labour MP Chris
Bryant told The Guardian that the relationship between Mr Johnson and Mr Murdoch has something 'decidedly unseemly' about it.

He said the mayor was trying to win the support of News International for any future leadership challenge.

Mr Johnson was treated as a leader-in-waiting at last year's Conservative Party Conference and he has shown he is not afraid to challenge the Chancellor George Osborne over fiscal policy.

Mr Johnson warned that the 
‘hair-shirt’ agenda set by the Chancellor and gloomy remarks from the 
Bank of England threaten hopes of a recovery.

Today the spokeswoman of the mayor's office told the MailOnline: 'We do not discuss private engagements'.

A spokesman for News International said: 'We do not comment on dinners attended by any of our senior executives and certainly not Mr Murdoch.

'I'm sure there were quite a few people at the dinner.'
