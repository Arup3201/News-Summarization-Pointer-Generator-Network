British expats living abroad would get their own MP under Liberal Democrat plans to make the Commons ‘fairer’.

Nick Clegg’s party has drawn up proposals for vast overseas constituencies covering Africa, Europe and North America represented by jet-setting MPs.

The Deputy Prime Minister also wants to see the voting age lowered to 16-year-olds, a special seat for the Commons Speaker and allowing two people to be a joint MP as part of a job-share.

The House of Commons would be bolstered by MPs from around the world under plans drawn up by the Liberal Democrats

There are more than 1million Brits living in Spain, who could get their own MP in the Commons

Many European countries already have seats in Parliament for nationals who have moved abroad.

France has six seats spread across Europe, two in America, two in Africa and one for Asia and Oceania.

There are 2.2million UK citizens living in EU countries alone, including 1million in Spain, 330,000 in France, 329,000 in Italy and 107,000 in Germany.

Under plans expected to be approved at the Lib Dem spring conference next month, the party will examine ‘the viability of overseas constituencies such as those  used in some other European countries’.

A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘British citizens can already vote when they move abroad for up to 15 years, but their votes are counted in the constituency [in which] they used to reside.

‘This would create separate constituencies in Parliament for the representatives of these voters.’

The package of measures, dubbed Power to the People, will also include introducing the Single Transferable Vote system for electing MPs and councillors, lowering the voting age to include 16 and 17-year-olds and creating a Speaker’s Seat ‘so that the electorate in the parliamentary constituency from which the Speaker is drawn are not disenfranchised’.

The Lib Dems will also propose allowing two people to stand for election to the Commons ‘on a job-share basis’.

The idea has previously been backed by Tory MP Sarah Wollaston who said last year: ‘It is time to start looking at how it can be made to work. Ultimately, voters would decide.

‘They may well take note of job sharers in other professions, who between them often deliver far more than a full-time equivalent.’
