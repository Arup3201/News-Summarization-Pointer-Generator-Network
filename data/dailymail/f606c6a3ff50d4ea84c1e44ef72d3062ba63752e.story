Wigan scrum-half Matty Smith has signed a new four-year deal that will keep him at the DW Stadium until the end of 2018.

The 27-year-old former St Helens half-back has become an integral member of Shaun Wane's team since joining them from Salford two years ago.

He won the Lance Todd Trophy as man of the match in the Warriors' 2013 Challenge Cup final win over Hull, was this week named in the Super League Dream Team for the second successive year and is in pole position to become England's scrum-half in the end-of-year Four Nations Series in Australia and New Zealand.

Wigan coach Shaun Wane said: 'I am so pleased that such an influential and skilful player like Matty has committed his future to us.

'His desire for success is a perfect match for us as a club and an organisation. He wants to be the best and he knows he can achieve that at Wigan.'

Smith, who played a key role in Wigan's double-winning success last year, scored 21 points in a man-of-the-match display in Thursday night's 57-4 play-off victory over Huddersfield, taking his tally for the season to 277.

'I love everything about the club,' Smith said. 'Once the contract had been offered, it didn't take me long to make my mind up to sign.

'Wigan have surpassed all the promises that were made when they originally signed me. My game has improved significantly under the guidance of Shaun Wane, who was an important factor in me extending my stay.

'Now I just want to win as much as I can with this great club and with my team-mates, who I enjoying working with so much.'
