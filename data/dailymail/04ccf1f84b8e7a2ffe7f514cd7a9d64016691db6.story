Try to find a public toilet in central London these days, and you may be out of luck... but you'll find plenty of underground spots for an artisan coffee or hipster cocktail in a mason jar.

Disused public restrooms have become popular spaces to open cafes, restaurants and bars, with new ones popping up all over the capital.

From eating a sandwich in an 1890s urinal, to throwing back a drink in an old Victorian underground station toilet, it is now perfectly acceptable to invite a Friday night date to 'meet you in the toilet'.

Sanitary sandwich spot: Attendant, in central London, made headlines when it opened last year in a former public toilet

Original: Customers can eat sandwiches in 1890s porcelain urinals which have been converted into individual booths

Restoration: The former WC, on Foley Street, received a £100,000 makeover

Attendant, in central London, made headlines when it opened last year after a £100,000 conversion from disused public toilet to gourmet cafe. 

The Doulton & Co porcelain urinals have been converted into individual booths, at which customers can eat sandwiches made by a former chef of Michelin--starred Pollen Street Social.

WC, in Clapham, is a former underground station toilet which had been derelict for years before being transformed into 'Wine & Charcuterie'.

Head underground: Attendant is just one of several new London hot spots opening in former public toilets

Open for business: The Convenience, in Hackney, is a cafe and bar inside an old public restroom

New life: The toilets stood unused for 20 years before the new owners moved in and converted the space, now a local gathering spot

Serving up wine with cheese and charcuterie plates, the former cubicle doors have been made into tables and the original toilets are still on display (there are more modern working ones for customer use).

The Bermondsey Arts Club is an Art Deco cocktail bar and arts club housed in former public conveniences on Tower Bridge Road, while Ladies & Gentlemen, in an old restroom in Kentish Town, is set to open soon.

The public toilets in Homerton, East London, had sat abandoned for 20 years before being turned into a local cafe and bar, complete with roof terrace. 

Public notice: The managers don't try to hide the cafe's previous function

How appetising: Customers eat alongside notices about venereal diseases
