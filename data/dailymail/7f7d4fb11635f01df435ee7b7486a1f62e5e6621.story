Money doesn't grow on trees because if it did, universities like the University of Michigan wouldn't have to spend almost half-a-million dollars on transporting an old oak.

A 250-year-old burr oak tree, the oldest on Michigan's campus, will cost $400,000 to move just 100 feet to a new home in a couple of weeks.

There's a 20 to 30 per cent the tree won't survive during the move but school officials are still willing to take a chance, reports Mlive.com.

Expensive by nature: The costly, months-long process of uprooting a 65-foot-tall, 250-year-old tree will culminate later this month as the University of Michigan has set a move day sometime in the coming weeks 

The move: A crew began the $400,000 process of excavating and moving the legacy burr oak tree in July in order to make way for the school's $135 million, donor-funded expansion at the school

Large cargo:  Crews have already placed pipes beneath the 700,000 pound tree's roots and will lift the tree from the center of the ground and then transport it  to a new home 

The burr oak tree stands at 65-feet tall and carries with it 250 years of history.

The incentive to move the tree came after it stood in the way of expanding the M. Ross School of Business as part of a $135 million donor funded project, reports The Washington Post.

Funding was made possible in part by real estate tycoon Stephen M. Ross for whom the business school was named.  

291 students and faculty signed a petition to save the oak.

'As I see it, the rationale for preserving the (legacy burr oak) tree is about history, tradition, pride and respect,' petition signer Jenny Cooper told the Ann Arbor News.

'The tree is a symbol of strength and resilience and far predates the university as part of the landscape.'

The University of Michigan hired specialists from a company called Environmental Design to oversee the project to increase the chances the tree will survive.

A piece of cake: Crews are planning to isolate the ground where the tree stands and remove it like the center of a piece of cake onto another plot of land on campus 

Moving land plots: The plan is to move it from its place in a courtyard at the north side of the Ross complex, facing the School of Education, to a lawn area off Tappan Street on University of Michigan's campus 

History:  A 250-year-old oak tree, the oldest on Michigan's campus, will cost $400,000 to move just 100 feet to a new home in a couple of weeks after students and faculty signed a petition to keep the tree alive 

Expanding: Tree is being moved in order to make way for the school's $135 million, donor-funded expansion at the school , specifically the M. Ross School of Business

Crews have already placed pipes beneath the 700,000 pound tree's roots and will lift the tree from the center of the ground.

Once they've isolated the tree, workers will transport the tree to a rolling platform and they will then place the tree in its final destination on October 25.

Despite some critics saying $400,000 is a waste of money to move a tree that may not survive, more people than not are happy the campus appreciates trees and the nature surrounding the school.

The University of Michigan released a press release describing announcing the endeavour.

'The transporter has approximately 100 wheels, which all operate independently. This gives us the flexibility to turn the tree as many different directions as needed to safely relocate the tree,' said Paul Cox, vice president of Environmental Design in the release.

'We expect the process of relocating the tree to take all day Saturday, again, weather permitting.' he added.

Cox explains that the cost has less to do with the act of moving the tree and more with keeping it alive.

'It’s very much like the Egyptians moved the blocks for the pyramids,' Cox told Fox News.

'The driver of the cost is the amount of weight being moved. When you move things that are 700,000 pounds — which is equivalent to moving 300 average size cars at the same time — that’s what’s driving the cost of it.'
