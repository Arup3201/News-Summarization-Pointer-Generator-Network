Police are hunting for this beggar who is suspected of stabbing a diner after he refused to give him money

A diner was blinded after a beggar stabbed him in the eye in a busy takeaway.

The 25-year-old man had been enjoying a meal with a friend at Spices in Winson Green, Birmingham, when he was hassled by the man.

After asking for a cigarette in the street, the beggar followed the man into the kebab house and began asking for money.

After the man, who was with a friend, refused to hand over any money for the sixth time, he had a weapon plunged into his eye.

The victim was rushed to Birmingham’s City Hospital but was blinded in his right eye.

Police are now appealing for witnesses to the horrific attack, which took place at around 7pm on December 5.

Detective
 Constable Sharon Duncan, from West Midlands Police, said: ‘The beggar 
approached the two men on five or six occasions and, even though they 
offered to buy him food, he kept asking for cash.

‘Finally he struck one of the men in his left eye with an unknown object.'

She added: ‘The young man was rushed to hospital, where he had to undergo surgery.

‘His eye was saved, but unfortunately he has lost the sight in it.

‘This is a devastating loss to a young man, who just appeared to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.’

The suspect is described as mixed race and 5ft 6ins tall. He was wearing a light grey hooded top with white writing on it.

The victim, 25, had been enjoying a meal with friends in Spices in Winson Green, Birmingham earlier this month
