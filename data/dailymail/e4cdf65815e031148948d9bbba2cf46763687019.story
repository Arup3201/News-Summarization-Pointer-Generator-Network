Family doctors will be forced to publish details of their earnings online, it was announced yesterday.

Each practice will be told to reveal the average earnings of its GPs by March 2016. Although individual salaries will not be published, it will give patients a much better idea of how much their doctor is taking home.

Family doctors who are partners in their surgeries earn an average of £102,000 a year – and one in ten earns more than the Prime Minister’s salary of £142,500.

Each GP practice will be told to reveal the average earnings of its doctors by March 2016 to give patients a better idea of how much their doctor is taking home 

The measure is part of a major revision of GPs’ official working conditions, to iron out a series of problems which came out of Labour’s botched 2004 contract, which saw GPs’ salaries soar by a third – even though most ended up opting out of responsibility for their patients outside office hours.

The new GP contract, unveiled by NHS England yesterday, also confirmed that every NHS patient in England will be able to access their medical record online free of charge from next year. At the moment, it costs them £10.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the measures would be brought in by April, and insisted England would be the first country in the world to ‘take this huge step’.

Speaking at the conference, Mr Hunt said: ‘It means you will no longer have to pay to access your medical record. You will be able to see it and show it to anyone you choose. You will find it easier to do detailed research about your condition and easier to challenge decisions.’

Mr Hunt used his speech to attack Labour, saying the party was ‘not fit to run our NHS’. He said: ‘Don’t you dare talk to us about running down the NHS. I simply say this to a Labour Party that still refuses to learn the lessons of poor care – until you do, you are not fit to run our NHS and if you won’t put patients first we will.

‘It will be the Conservative Party that completes Nye Bevan’s vision for an NHS that treats every patient with dignity and respect. We will finish the job.’

But doctors said yesterday that David Cameron’s plans for everyone to have access to a GP seven days a week were unworkable because of a chronic shortage of staff.

The Prime Minister has pledged £400million over the next five years to pay for extended evening and weekend openings for GP surgeries. The Family Doctors Association said the plans had no basis in reality and the funding provided was ‘chicken feed’. And the Royal College of GPs said promises to employ another 5,000 GPs by 2020 would be nowhere near enough.

Dr Peter Swinyard, chairman of the Family Doctors Association, said: ‘The problem with just making announcements like this is that there is no backing of reality. The general practice service is at the moment in the biggest crisis I’ve known in 30 years.’

Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ‘The Prime Minister has pledged that there are 5,000 more GPs in the pipeline. That is a good start, but we estimate that we will need at least 8,000 by 2020 just to continue to deliver services on the basis of the existing hours GPs are contracted to provide.’

Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham said: ‘David Cameron made an almost identical announcement this time last year but, in the 12 months since, he has made it harder – not easier – to get a GP appointment.’
