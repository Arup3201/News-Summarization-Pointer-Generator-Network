Georgia May Jagger and boyfriend Josh McLennan are making their real-life chemistry pay as they star in a sexy new campaign for fashion brand Sisley.

The 21-year-old strikes an array of sultry poses as her beau Josh McLellan, 22 gazes on adoringly.

The pair are pictured lounging in bed, dining out and generally looking loved-up as they model the Italian label's Autumn Winter 2013/14 collection, which features rich fabrics, unexpected details and vibrant colours.

British model and musician Josh started his career as a model thanks to photographer Alasdair McLellan who shot his band Turbogeist. He then did his first Topman campaign and was picked up by Select.

He has since appeared on the pages of the world's most famous fashion magazines, including i-D, British Vogue, Vogue Japan and L’Officiel Hommes.

Georgia has featured in campaigns for Hudson, Rimmel, Chanel, Versace and most recently Sunglass Hut and Madonna’s collection Material Girl. She's just shot with Mario Sorrenti for Cavalli’s new fragrance.

The couple were pictured together last month as the opening of the Longchamp flagship store on London's Regent Street.
