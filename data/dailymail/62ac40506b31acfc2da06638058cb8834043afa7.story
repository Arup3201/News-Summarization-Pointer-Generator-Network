The number of British adults with diabetes has risen to more than 3.2 million – up by a million in just  seven years.

New figures show 163,000 people were diagnosed with the condition last year, the biggest total in a year since 2008.

This brings the total to 3,208,014 adults with diabetes – or one in 17 of the population. In 2006, the figure was 2.2 million.

A further 850,000 are thought to have undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes, according to charity Diabetes UK, which blames the ‘unfolding public health disaster’ on the country’s obesity crisis.

Nine out of ten people with diabetes have Type 2, which occurs when the body gradually loses the ability to process blood sugar, leading to high levels which can damage organs.

It is strongly linked to being overweight and unhealthy diets.

The NHS spends £14 billion a year – 10 per cent of its budget – treating diabetes and its complications.

Every year in England and Wales, 24,000 people with diabetes die earlier than expected, a situation that is expected to get even worse without urgent action.

Diabetes UK wants local NHS organisations to fully implement the NHS Health Check, which should be offered to everyone aged 40 to 74, to help identify people at high risk of Type 2 diabetes.

Chief executive Barbara Young said: ‘The big increase in the number of people with diabetes confirms that we are in the middle of an unfolding public health disaster that demands urgent action. It is frightening to think that one in 17 people has been diagnosed.

‘Firstly, we need more focus on preventing Type 2 diabetes, as this is the only way we can bring the rapid rise in diabetes cases under control. This means properly implementing the NHS Health Check so we can identify more people at high risk, and then making sure they get the support they need to reduce that risk.

‘We also need to address the obesity crisis, which is what is fuelling the increase in Type 2, by making healthy food cheaper and more accessible and by making it easier for people to build physical activity into their daily lives.

‘But as well as doing more to prevent Type 2, we need to get much better at treating diabetes because the level of priority the NHS gives the condition does not reflect the size of the shadow it is casting over our nation’s health.

‘The result is that while diabetes is hugely expensive, accounting for 10p of every pound the NHS spends, what we are getting in return for that money is healthcare that is patchy and inconsistent.

‘From access to education when people are diagnosed right the way through to the care they receive in hospital, there are too many people getting a raw deal and this is fuelling high rates of diabetes-related complications and early death.’
