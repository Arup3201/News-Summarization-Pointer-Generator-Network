She has already taken prizes for having the best hair, style and body.

And now Cheryl Cole can add another string to her bow because she has been voted as having the world's best smile - even outshining the Duchess of Cambridge and Hollywood A-lister Angelina Jolie.

The former Girls Aloud singer's dazzling white teeth and wide, confident smile see her top a poll of our favourite celebrity grins.

Say cheese: Cheryl Cole has been voted as having the world's best smile

The 29 year old's mega-watt red carpet beam has won the hearts of one in five Britons (18 per cent), a study found.

The Duchess of Cambridge and This Morning's Holly Willoughby finished second (14 per cent) and third (13 per cent) in the poll for their pearly white grins.

The beautiful Brits beat hot Hollywood actresses Julia Roberts, Angelina Jolie and Cameron Diaz.

Psychologist Emma Kenny reveals how Cheryl's broad smile proves especially popular because it looks so welcoming and open.

She said: 'We all make very fast judgements of each other based on a smile - we know from research that clean, white teeth are an integral part of that.

'Cheryl Cole is likely to have achieved a high score here because she has a wide, confident smile.

'In human communication terms, this suggests openness and confidence.'

Although the census highlights how important healthy teeth and gums are to Brits, it also uncovered flaws in the way we care for them.

Three-quarters of us don't brush for the recommended two minutes twice a day (75 per cent) and the same amount don't floss daily (73 per cent).

Sugar is one of the main causes of tooth decay, yet one in five Brits (21 per cent) confess they eat more sugary snacks when feeling stressed.

An unhealthy nine per cent turn to alcohol, six per cent drink more caffeine and seven per cent smoke more than usual under pressure, figures show.

Cheryl Cole (18 per cent)Kate Middleton (14 per cent)Holly Willoughby (13 per cent)Julia Roberts (12 per cent)Angelina Jolie (five per cent)Cameron Diaz (four per cent)Emma Watson (four per cent)Tulisa Contostavlos (two per cent)

All these factors are bad for our teeth and could stop us matching Cheryl's smile, found the study by Listerine.

Nutritionist Amanda Hamilton added: 'It seems sugar is our crutch of choice, especially when we're stressed and because we lead increasingly stressful lives, we're eating more of it than ever before.

'This has an obvious impact on your teeth.

'Just like other crutches we have for stress such as alcohol, caffeine and nicotine, it's worth remembering that a short-term boost can have a long-term impact - in this case, on your smile.'

It has also been discovered that it’s not wobbly body parts gnawing at a quarter of the nation’s confidence, but their crooked smiles – resoundingly beating concerns about bottoms, legs, hair and chests.

And it seems that a healthy set of teeth is important because, according to a study by Invisalign, three quarters of Brits rated a person’s smile as important when first considering going on a date with them.

They also found that crooked teeth would put over a quarter of people off dating someone, a much bigger turnoff than wrinkles and 50 per cent of people surveyed believe that straight teeth reflect how much pride you take in your overall personal hygiene.
