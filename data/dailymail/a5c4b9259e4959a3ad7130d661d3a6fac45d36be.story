Forget chasing mice - this athletic kitten's more interested in brushing up on his ball skills.

Two-month-old Zeke was filmed as he excitedly batted a miniature plush basketball around his pen at the Cincinnati Zoo in Ohio.

The spotted youngster, who is a Serval breed, didn't let the cameras distract him from his sporty antics and he continued to play away.

On a roll: Two-month-old Zeke was filmed as he excitedly batted a miniature plush basketball around his pen at the Cincinnati Zoo in Ohio

Lost in the moment: The spotted youngster who is a Serval breed, didn't let the cameras distract him from his sporty antics and he continued to play away 

Footage shows him rolling around as he scoops the ball between his paws. 

Zeke was born at the Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville, Texas, before being transferred to his new home.

He is currently in quarantine at Cincinnati Zoo’s nursery to ensure he is healthy before being introduced to the other animals.

He will eventually be part of the park's Cat Ambassador Program which allows visitors - by special arrangement - to see some of the  cats up-close and without bars.

Serval cats are native to the grasslands of Africa. They have the longest legs of any cat, relative to body size.

Weighing an average of 40 pounds they can grow 24 inches in height and up to 36 inches in length. 

The Serval is currently classified as 'least concern' on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List, but they do face threats, in the wild, from larger cats. 

They are also hunted for their pelts.

Despite being wild, the Serval cat has been kept as a pet by Europeans for hundreds of years.

On show: He will eventually be part of the park's Cat Ambassador Program, which allows visitors, by special arrangement, to see some of the beautiful cats, up-close and without bars
