Britain sent a laser weapon to the Falklands to 'dazzle' low-flying Argentine pilots as they attacked Royal Navy ships, secret government papers revealed today.

The secret device was developed quickly and secretly but was never used in action during the 1982 conflict.

Its existence was revealed a year later to Margaret Thatcher in a January 1983 letter, marked 'Top Secret and UK Eyes A,' from Michael Heseltine.

Attack: An Argentine jet flies in to attack British ships, but it was revealed today Britain developed a laser to dazzle them and sent it across to the Falklands

Tragedy: HMS Antelope sinking in San Carlos Water after it was hit on May 24, 1982 by an Argentinian bomb

The then newly-appointed defence secretary was briefing the Iron lady about the Soviet Union's laser weaponry, and told the Conservative leader Britain already had one.

Flashback: Then defence secretary Michael Heseltine revealed the device existed in a top secret memo to Margaret Thatcher released today

Mr Heseltine wrote: 'We developed and deployed with very great urgency a naval laser weapon, designed to dazzle low flying Argentine pilots attacking ships, to the Task Force in the South Atlantic. This weapon was not used in action and knowledge of it has been kept to a very restricted level.'

His briefing on military capabilities also touches on the laser weapon research and development programmes called Raker and Shingle which were 'proceeding at high priority,' according to the papers.

He claims the Soviet Union could field laser weapons by the mid-1980s but it was uncertain whether owning such offensive laser weapons was useful.

By the end of 1979 British interests were in using medium power laser directed against relatively softer targets such as eyes, optic and electro-optic sensors.

His note said: 'the Russians could be in a position to field such weapons by the mid-1980s (in fact, the Russians may already have deployed a laser weapon on the cruiser Kirov)'.

British researchers concentrated on countermeasures. Programmes that were under way included Raker, which aimed to think up every possible way of protecting sensors. There was also the development programme known as Shingle which sought to capitalise on any practical solutions arising out of the Raker work.

Meanwhile new documents reveal that when Margaret Thatcher visited the Falklands to mark the 150th anniversary of the establishment of a permanent British settlement, it took six months to plan and cost  £209,867.

Victory: Lady Thatcher and Denis met soldiers and civil leaders on a trip that cost £209,000

The Iron Lady flew with the RAF to Ascension Island and then by Hercules to Port Stanley for the four-day trip.

There was intense secrecy surrounding her visit as they feared the Argentinians might still be a threat, as it came eight months after the war ended.

The press were told Lady Thatcher was off to Chequers for the weekend, but instead she and Denis went to RAf Brize Norton to start the journey.

Her trip was only announced when she arrived.

Duty clerk Alan Logan wrote in a top secret note the importance 'of maintaining total secrecy of the visit.

'The very fact that it was Friday night lended itself readily to the pretence that the Prime Minister and Mr Thatcher would be going to Chequers and, therefore, it would be normal for their luggage to be in the front hall, albeit slightly more than normal'.

The notes also reveal more mundane details about the trip, where the Prime Minister decided not to take 'a good Stilton' for civil and military leaders on the island and that she would lay a wreath of synthetic poppies because  real ones would not survive the long trip from Britain.
