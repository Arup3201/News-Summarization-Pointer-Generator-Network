Chuka Umunna yesterday refused five times to say Labour would hand back money if a donor was found to have used aggressive tax avoidance.

The party’s business spokesman dodged the question repeatedly by insisting he was ‘not aware’ of any such donation.

He even refused to rule out Labour accepting the money if it knew in advance that a donor was aggressively avoiding tax, saying only that the party would ‘think twice’ before saying yes.

His comments came as details emerged of how unions which handed millions to Labour pay no corporation tax on millions of pounds of investment income.

Despite criticising tax avoidance by corporations and wealthy individuals, trade unions exploited a little-known loophole to avoid paying millions in corporation tax last year.

Tory MPs seized on the revelations to accuse the unions of ‘financial trickery’ and demand Ed Miliband return the union donations.

Between them, the Labour-affiliated unions Unite, UNISON, GMB and USDAW made nearly £15million on investments worth a total of £223million last year.

But they paid no tax on this income, which if it was taxed at the main corporation tax rate of 21 per cent would have netted the Exchequer some £3.1million.

Unions insisted they were not liable for corporation tax because of a legal exemption for unions.

But Tory MP Charlie Elphicke said: ‘This is yet more straight-up hypocrisy from Ed Miliband. He tried to sound tough on tax, now it turns out his biggest donors are tax avoiders.

This is an edited transcript of Chuka Umunna’s interview by James Naughtie:

JN: Can we take it that if you discover that anyone who’s given money to the Labour Party has been involved in aggressive tax avoidance, you give the money back?

CU: I think the Labour Party would think twice about accepting money from people who fit the description you give...

JN: No, simple question: If you’ve taken it, will you give the money back?

CU: Well I’m not aware that we have taken money from anybody who’s engaged...

JN: No, but if it emerged, would you give that money back?

CU: Well as I said, I think if Labour found out somebody was engaged in aggressive tax avoidance, it would think twice before taking the money...

JN: But if you had taken the money, you’d give it back?

CU: I’m not aware that we have taken it...

JN: Answer the question. If the money came from a tax dodger, would you give it back?

CU: Well I’m not aware that it has, that we have received any monies from people engaging in aggressive tax avoidance.

‘Hardworking taxpayers can’t get away with this financial trickery, so why should Ed Miliband and his donors?’

Last week Mr Miliband attacked David Cameron as ‘dodgy’ over donations to the Tories from alleged tax avoiders. But since then questions have emerged about the tax affairs of a string of Labour donors.

Mr Umunna was quizzed by Jim Naughtie on Radio 4’s Today programme yesterday. He was asked if it was an ‘absolute given’ that if party bosses were to discover that a donor was involved in aggressive tax avoidance they would give the money back.

Mr Umunna repeatedly avoided answering the ‘hypothetical question’, saying he was ‘not aware’ of anyone who was accused of tax avoidance.

Details of unions’ investment income and tax payments are based on figures provided to the Certification Officer, who audits union affairs. Figures for 2013 show Unite made £2.8million on an investment of £51.3million but its return states that corporation tax is payable only on investment income which exceeds ‘expenditure on provident benefits’.

Unison made £298,000 on an investment of £114.2million, but its annual return said no corporation tax was payable ‘because of relief available’.

USDAW made nearly £10million on an investment of £40.2million and the GMB £1.7million on £17.3million.

Since Mr Miliband became Labour leader the same four unions have donated a total of £30.6million to the party.

The union tax loophole is contained within the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, which allows them to offset costs such as sick pay, accident compensation and employment tribunal costs against income.

Ed Miliband suffered a fresh blow yesterday – after ‘staunchly Labour’ TV stars Ant and Dec (pictured) attacked his leadership and questioned whether they could vote for him.

Declan Donnelly, 39, said he had always voted Labour but was unimpressed with Mr Miliband. He said: ‘I’m not sure I could picture him [Ed Miliband] as prime minister.’

Ant McPartlin, also 39, said the pair were ‘staunchly Labour’ but didn’t know if they could vote Labour under Mr Miliband.

They also told The Times that they followed politics ‘keenly’ but were disillusioned with both Labour and the Coalition.
