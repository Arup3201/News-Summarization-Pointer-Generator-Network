What turns you off most when it comes to the opposite sex? Looks? Bad dress sense? Bad manners?

No, in fact the nation’s top turn off is bad smells.

Almost 80% of women said that if a man smells bad, it is their biggest no-no, and unkempt John McCririck was awarded the status of 'most smelly celebrity' by fragrance-conscious voters.

The Duchess of Cambridge was voted the nicest smelling celebrity whilst John McCririck the most smelly

Bad smell was rated a bigger turn off than a poor sense of humour (14%) and bad dress sense (1%).

It seems like the best advice for people looking for love is to keep on top of their washing with clean, fresh-smelling clothes after laundry-fresh smells came top in a poll of the most attractive smells (48%), followed by perfume or aftershave (32%).

The pristine Duchess of Cambridge was the celebrity that voters believed would smell the nicest, with her sister coming in third position below David Beckham.

The poll, which was carried out by Surf liquid detergent,  also revealed both men and women find bad breath (38%) and the smell of cigarettes (37%) highly unattractive. 

David Beckham and Pippa Middleton came in second and third place respectively for their perceived great smell

One man who will be taking this advice is heartthrob and star of The Only Way Is Essex, Joey Essex, who has teamed up with Surf to create the new limited edition scent Surf Summer D’reem.

Joey Essex said: 'It’s important to always smell good for the ladies so I’ve created this reem scent, to make my clothes always smell amazing, even after a night out with the lads at Sugar Hut.'

Fragrance training consultant, John Ayres added: 'A fragrance or scent on another person that reminds you of a past occasion can evoke incredibly strong and immediate emotions.

'You can form positive or negative opinions of a person almost instantly and if you suddenly smell a fragrance that reminds you of a good or bad time; it can have an effect on your mood too.

By surrounding yourself with things that smell nice or that remind you of a happy occasion, you get little lifts whenever you come across them.'

According to the research, one in four (26%) Brits wait until they have worn their clothes at least four times before washing them.

Brits also said that the scent of sun cream is the most reminiscent of summer holidays (32%), while over a quarter of Brits (26%) said that the smell of the seaside evokes the strongest memories of great summer holidays.
