The tennis dress from one of the world's most famous posters is to be auctioned - and is valued at  £1,000.

The little white-lacy number is recognisable from the Athena tennis picture where a blonde model shows her bare bottom.

Taken on a court at the University of Birmingham in 1976, it has now sold more than two million copies internationally.

Remember this? A dress from one of the world's most famous posters, the Athena tennis picture, is going under the hammer in the Midlands

Despite its fame, the teenage star wasn't identified until 35 years later, when she was named as freelance illustrator Fiona Walker.

The dress, made by Fiona's friend Carol Knotts, has been hidden away in a cupboard until now.

Carol, now a barrister, said: 'I used to get an allowance from my parents but to make it stretch further, I made my own clothes.

'As I played tennis at the local club, I bought a "Simplicity" pattern and made my own dress, complete with lace trim.

'Fiona one day asked if she could borrow my dress and racquet and when she returned them, she gave me a big box of chocolates as a thank you.

'It's a little piece of tennis history and I hope someone might find it an interesting novelty item to buy.'

Fiona, a freelance illustrator, was the girlfriend of unknown 29-year-old commercial photographer Martin Elliot when the picture was taken and she had never played tennis before.

Guess who? The snap of Fiona holding her buttocks was taken on a tennis court at the University of Birmingham in 1976 and has now sold more than two million copies internationally

Unsurprisingly the photograph, since recreated by superstars such as Kylie Minogue and Ricky Gervais, shot Martin to fame.

The couple split in 1979, three years after the photo was taken. Fiona was never officially paid for the shot, but Martin always said: 'I looked after her.'

The dress, racquet and two posters are estimated to fetch £1,000 to £2,000 at Fieldings Auctioneers in Stourbridge, West Midlands.

The lot will be auctioned on July 5 - Wimbledon ladies' finals day next month - and is valued at between £1,000 and £2,000.

Fieldings' director Nick Davies said: 'A generation of people will remember this poster so it's a good time to put it up for auction. This is the most famous tennis dress of all time, yet it has never graced Centre Court.

'It's an unknown quantity in terms of value but we are sure will create plenty of interest.'
