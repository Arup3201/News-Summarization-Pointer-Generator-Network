Germany's economy slipped into reverse in the last quarter of 2011, despite showing strong overall growth of 3 per cent for the year.

The country's Federal Statistics Office said the economy was likely to contract by 0.25 per cent in the fourth quarter, although that figure will not be confirmed until next month.

Joerg Kraemer, chief economist for Commerzbank, said he expected the economy to shrink in the first quarter of 2012 as well - technically putting Germany in a recession.

The most recent economic indicators suggest 2012 will be a tough year, both for Germany and the rest of Europe.

Ferdinand Fichtner, head of the DIW economic institute, said: 'While the German economy grew very strongly in the last two years, this year's growth will be much lower, especially because of the crisis in the eurozone.'

Germany's annual growth rate was achieved in spite of the financial crisis besetting Europe, which has other economies including Greece, Spain and Italy struggling with huge debts and slumping output.

The country's 2011 growth puts it in a small group of strongly performing eurozone countries, including Finland, Austria, Slovakia and Luxembourg.

France will see more moderate growth of around 1.7 per cent for the year, according to the International Monetary Fund, while output stagnates amid high unemployment in Spain and Italy.

Britain's economy went from a 0.5 per cent contraction in the final quarter of 2010, to 0.5 per cent growth in the third quarter of 2011, suggesting the economy will have grown slightly.

Greece and Portugal, bailed out to avoid default, are both in deep recession.

Germany is expected to outperform the U.S., which announces its 2011 GDP data on January 27 and is expected to have grown by 1.6 per cent for the year.

But that figure remains far short of emerging economies like China - at an estimated 9.5 per cent - or India, with 7.8 per cent.

Its performance means Germany's deficit is down to only 1 per cent of GDP - well below the 3 per cent limit enshrined in the eurozone's rules.

In 2010, the German economy grew by 3.7 per cent after a painful contraction of 5.1 per cent in 2009.

Simon Junker, an expert with the DIW institute, warned expectations for the economy in 2012 were dampened by the eurozone crisis and both exports and imports would slow down.

'Germany's strongly export-driven economy will not be able to elude the slowdown of the global economy,' he said.

'Especially German exports will suffer from the eurozone crisis.'

But the DIW said there was reason to be optimistic if eurozone governments 'manage to quickly and believably contain the crisis'.
