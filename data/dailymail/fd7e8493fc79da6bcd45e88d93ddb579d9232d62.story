Arjen Robben looked as if he was embarrassing Sergio Ramos when beating the hapless Spaniard in a straight foot race as Holland humiliated the world champions.

The Real Madrid defender was left trailing in his wake as Robben stormed through; it appeared Ramos was leggy, only for FIFA statistics to later reveal that the 37km per hour sprint was the fastest ever recorded by a footballer.

Iker Casillas could then only watch as the Dutchman danced beyond him to score his second sumptuous goal of the night.

On his way: Holland's Arjen Robben recorded the world's fastest ever sprint during a game

And gone! The Dutchman set a world record speed of 37km/h as he breezed beyond Sergio Ramos

Blowing: Ramos (and defender Jordi Alba, back) couldn't keep up with Robben as he scored his second

What a shot: Spanish daily AS splashed on the news that Robben is the fastest in the world

But while the finish was perfect in its execution, the foot race preceding it was even more impressive.

Robben chased on to a ball from his own half, always half a yard ahead of Ramos, before finessing to slot beyond the goalkeeper.

The incident summed up the gulf in class between Louis van Gaal and Vicente Del Bosque's sides during their opening game.

Spanish daily AS were understandably fuming the morning after, but tempered the mood when they chose to splash on the news that Robben could rival some of the best in athletics on Tuesday morning as his peak speed is just seven km/h slower than Usain Bolt.

They also claim that the 30-year-old has surpassed Theo Walcott's previous record of 35.7kmph, while Cristiano Ronaldo is only sixth in the list of the fastest ever.

Antonio Valencia is fractions quicker than Gareth Bale, with Wayne Rooney in the top eight with a top speed of 32.1km/h.

Lionel Messi is just ahead of the England striker, with Aaron Lennon the fifth quickest at 33.8km/h.

Arjen Robben: 37 km/h, Theo Walcott 35.7, Antonio Valencia 35.2, Gareth Bale 34.7, Aaron Lennon 33.8, Cristiano Ronaldo 33.6, Lionel Messi 32.5, Wayne Rooney 32.1

Made them look stupid! The 30-year-old checked back to beat Iker Casillas to notch Holland's fifth of the night
