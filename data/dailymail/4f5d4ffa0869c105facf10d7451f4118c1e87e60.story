Pictures of Sofia Vergara's teen wedding to her childhood sweetheart have emerged for the first time, and she doesn't seem to have aged much since that time. 

The Modern Family star, who got engaged to Joe Manganiello on Christmas Day after a whirlwind six-month romance, was previously married to her high school love Joe Gonzalez. 

The pair married in her hometown of Barranquilla, Colombia, in 1991 when she was just 18 and MailOnline has unearthed exclusive photographs of the nuptials.

The brunette beauty wore a dramatic long-sleeve cream gown that featured elaborate pearl beading, gloves, a matching head piece and long veil.

Her hair was pulled back and she wore heavy make-up including lashings of red lipstick. 

Sofia was a fledgling model at the time, having been scouted by an agency while on a Colombian beach at 17. 

She is seen walking down the aisle with her proud father Julio Enrique Vergara Robayo, who worked in the meat industry. (Her mother Margarita was a homemaker.)

She shared romantic kisses with her new husband in the snaps and toasted their marriage with a glass of champagne at the reception.

Beauty: Sofia's good looks were first spotted by a modeling scout on a Colombian beach a year before this wedding 

The couple welcomed a son, Manolo, a year after saying 'I do' but split in 1993 shortly after his birth. 

Sofia was briefly linked to Tom Cruise in 2005 after finding success in the US. She was engaged to her on-again off-again beau Nick Loeb for several years but the pair never married. 

The relationship was called off for good in May 2014 and she started dating Joe just two months later. 

The Magic Mike actor proposed to the Modern Family actress in Kauai over Christmas.

Short lived: The couple split in 1993 just two years after saying 'I do'

He was 'genuinely nervous', according to source, and didn't want to pop the question in a public setting at the St. Regis Hotel in Princeville just in case she said no.

An insider told People: 'He said he wanted to keep it private just in case she didn't say yes. It actually didn't seem like he was joking about that. He did seem genuinely nervous that maybe this wasn't going to go well. He said this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity with a one-in-a-million woman.'

The 38-year-old heartthrob spent weeks planning how he would ask the 42-year-old beauty to be his wife and got down on bended knee at sunset in the palatial suite at the five-star hotel in Hawaii.

The insider added: 'This wasn't spontaneous. Joe definitely planned ahead and contacted the hotel weeks in advance to discuss certain things he wanted to do.

'He didn't want to propose in a public setting, even though there are so many beautiful spots on the hotel grounds that have spectacular views and are well-known as places where people pop the question. But Joe said he didn't want to risk anyone walking by and witnessing it, and he didn't want to tip off Sofia by having security there shooing people away.'

The couple immediately toasted their engagement with champagne and 'desserts were sent later on.'
