The bodies of a father and son from Minnesota, who went missing while hiking in the Rockies in April, were found Thursday.

Damian McManus and his son Evan disappeared on April 2 while on a spring break hike in Colorado, in a week when the state experienced deep snowfall and sub-zero temperatures.

The search for the men had been resumed by volunteer firefighters, and their bodies were found in Mount Evans at about 10am Thursday.

The Alpine and Rocky Mountain Rescue retrieved the bodies from the mountain, and a coroner is expected to officially identify them and investigate what caused their death.

'It appears the agonizing search is over,' Suzy Goldstein Lewis, a spokeswoman for the family, told the Star Tribune.

McManus, 51, and his son, 18, had embarked on the impromptu trip while his wife Katherine, and Evan's twin sister Lauren were enjoying a vacation in Mexico.

At first the women blamed poor cell phone reception on the lack of contact from their family, but once they arrived home in Minnesota they realized both men's phones were dead and that they were missing.

Early search efforts were hampered by wintry conditions, with rescue teams having to use snowshoes and snowmobiles to try to find the pair.

It snowed every day for a week after the father and son were last heard from, covering their tracks and leading search teams to conclude that there was no way they could have survived the freezing temperatures.

Their car was found early on by a lake popular with tourists, but snowfall had already covered their tracks.

After the initial rescue attempt firefighters with mountaineering experience continued the search in their own time.

Their expenses were covered by a private donation fund, Twin Cities reported.

In a recent post on Facebook before her 
husband and son were found, Ms McManus thanked the volunteers for trying
 to bring closure to the family. 

'Even though we have been cut in half by snow and by this mountain, we are WHOLE in spirit, love, faith and a lifetime of memories,' she said.

A fund has been started to help the family cover costs.Donations can be sent to Citizens Independent Bank, c/o McManus Family Fund, 5000 W. 36th St., St. Louis Park, MN 55416.
