Space experts are trying to solve the mystery of ‘a UFO fragment’ which crashed close to a village in Siberia.

Locals insist the metallic object – which resembles a large rubbish bin – fell from the skies but initial checks by experts have concluded it is neither from a rocket nor a missile.

It is now under police guard as interest in the ‘visitor’ intensifies.

The 'fragment' does not appear to come from any known missile or space technology. Russian space experts will make an announcement shortly

The six-foot metal object is now under police guard as the Russian space agency prepares to examine it

Weighing 200 kilograms and around two 
metres in height, locals fixed it onto a trailer and took across the 
snow to the village where local inspectors checked it. 

‘The object found is not related to 
space technology. A final conclusion can be made after a detailed study 
of the object by experts,' said the Russian space agency Roscosmos.

Locals insist the metallic object - resembling a large shiny rubbish bin - fell from the skies. The object is six feet long and is at least partially made of titanium steel.

It's now under police guard as interest in the 'visitor' intensifies.

It was found near a village called Otradnensky some two thousand miles and three time zones east of Moscow.

The Russian media immediately claimed ‘fragments of a UFO’ were discovered in the remote forest.

Locals had heard strange sounds in the thick woodland in December, it was claimed. 

But it was only on Sunday that the find was reported to local police who then alerted Moscow.

Yuri Bornyakov, head of rescue service department of Kuibyshevski district of Novosibirsk region, said: ‘We measured the radiation level near and inside the object. We found no radiation here.’ 

The 200-kilo metal fragment was examined for radiation. A theory that it's a remnant from a rocket launch in Kazakhstan also appears to be mistaken

Initial theories that it was part of a space rocket or a satellite form a failed launch in Kazakhstan have been denied.

Head of Department for Civil Defence and Emergency Situations of the Kuibyshevski, Valery Vasiliev, said part of the fragment was made of ultra strong titanium.

Finder Sergey Bobrov undertook in an official statement that he would keep the UFO safe, but locals reported that  ‘police came during the night and secretly removed it’.

A local police spokesman confirmed the object was now under guard by the force on orders from unspecified authorities.

‘You can see inside it, all is open, it's empty, no danger here. We were asked to take and store it. We brought it here. And now we are going to wait until they come to take it if they need it’ said Sergei Sulein.
