A dim-witted thief appears to have led the cops straight to his door after using the back of a grocery receipt to write a note that he handed over to bank teller during a robbery two weeks ago.

The scrap of the receipt, which the robber left at the Home Federal Bank in Bend, Oregon, had the last four digits of a food stamp account and the account balance on it.

That was enough information for police to track down Robert Short, 54, who has been arrested on theft and robbery charges.

Robert Short, 54, has denied that he carried out the robbery even though the information on the receipt led police directly to him and his DNA was found on a stocking cap left at the crime scene

Short denies the charges. He told police he never keeps receipts and would have thrown it in the trash, where anyone could have picked it up.

He also said that a hitchhiker must have stolen a black stocking cap that police kept as evidence after it was knocked off when the robber and a bank client struggled during the April 24 holdup, the affidavit said.

Police told Short his DNA was on the cap.

In an affidavit, Detective Jeff Frickey said he was able to track Short down by checked the digits on the receipt against state records which provided a name to go with the account number.Â

An online search of the name then turned up a pawn shop transaction with a telephone number and a service provider then came up with the coordinates of the phone, the Stillwater Campground in Central Oregon.

Further investigation revealed Short has 36 arrests in Oregon, including six felony convictions, according to the affidavit. He also has 17 arrests in Washington, including one for a bank robbery in 1989.

Short was arrested on suspicion of first-degree theft, second-degree robbery and harassment. He is being held without bail at the Deschutes County jail. A plea hearing is scheduled May 27.
