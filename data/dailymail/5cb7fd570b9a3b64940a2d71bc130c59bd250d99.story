A senior police officer accused of selling inside information about the phone-hacking inquiry yesterday said she acted out of anger at the ‘palpable excitement’ of her colleagues over interviewing actress Sienna Miller.

Detective Chief Inspector April Casburn added that working in the Metropolitan Police’s ‘male-dominated’ counter-terrorism unit was like working in a ‘21st-century Life on Mars’, referring to the BBC drama that depicted the police’s sexist attitudes in the Seventies.

Casburn, 53, rang the now-defunct News of the World after the Met launched a new investigation into journalists intercepting mobile phone messages.

DCI April Casburn, who is accused of trying to sell information to the News of the World, said fellow Met officers were 'excited' about meeting Sienna Miller

Southwark Crown Court heard she spoke
about hacking probe Operation Varec, and told journalist Tim Wood that 
six people were under suspicion, including the News of the World’s 
former editor, then Downing Street communications chief Andy Coulson.

She added that detectives were under 
pressure from Lord Prescott to pursue the inquiry, and that the 
operation was a waste of resources that should be spent fighting 
terrorism.

Mr Wood told the hearing that he 
wrote an email to two colleagues after the call on September 11, 2010, 
stating that a ‘senior policewoman’ wanted to ‘sell inside information’.

Casburn tearfully denied asking for 
money, and said she had been angry at resources being taken away from 
battling terrorism on the anniversary of the September 11 attacks.

The officer, who carried out work for
both MI5 and MI6, told the court that during a meeting of senior 
counter-terrorism officers the day before she made the call ‘there was a
palpable excitement regarding who would get to go and see Sienna 
Miller’, a victim of phone-hacking.

She added: ‘I felt very strongly that
we shouldn’t be doing hacking. Our function was to prevent terrorist 
attacks and I was particularly worried that the behaviour of my 
colleagues was such that they thought it was a bit of a jolly. It made 
me really angry.

April Casburn arrives at Southwark Crown Court in London where she told the jury she had been angry resources were being diverted away from counter-terrorism

‘I spoke to a female colleague and we said it’s like a 21st-century Life on Mars. Very male-dominated.’

Casburn is the first person to face 
trial as part of Operation Elveden – the investigation into journalists 
paying public officials for information – following dozens of arrests.

The mother of two said going to the 
News of the World, which was closed in July 2011 due to its involvement 
in phone-hacking, was a ‘foolish decision’.

However, she added: ‘I think in some 
circumstances it’s right to go to the Press because they do expose 
wrongdoing and they expose poor decisions.’

The newspaper did not publish any of the information from the DCI, nor was any payment made.

Casburn, who lives in Essex, denies one count of misconduct in public office.

The trial continues.
