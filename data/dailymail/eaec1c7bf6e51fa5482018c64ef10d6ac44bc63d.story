A holiday cottage called 'Best view in Britain' is the latest beauty spot at risk of being blighted by a wind turbine.

The property near Macclesfield, Cheshire, was christened after its uninterrupted panorama on the edge of the Peak District National Park.

But plans for a 40metre wind turbine to be built just 300 metres away could soon prompt a name change.

Best view in Britain: A holiday cottage overlooking the Cheshire countryside may have its view blighted by a wind turbine

Panorama: The owners boast of sunsets like the Caribbean, but are worried business will be spoilt by the eyesore

Owner Miranda Rijks says the planning application, if successful, will damage her business as well as the view.

She is among dozens of residents who have joined Sutton Parish Council in opposing the plan for a wind turbine on Sutton Common.

The Sutton Common fightback is just one of many battles being waged by local campaigners up and down the country, and comes days after Scottish tourism chiefs warned that wind farms could drive holidaymakers away.

Submitted by local farmer Marshall Waller, the Sutton Common turbine is aimed at cutting power costs and providing clean energy.

Objectors claim it will be unsightly and noisy. But, like so many others, they find current planning law, with its presumption in favour of renewable energy schemes, stacked against them.

The law states that the adverse effects of a turbine can be proved to ‘significantly and demonstrably’ outweigh its supposed carbon-reduction benefits, then the application may approved regardless of how strongly the local community objects.

Plans under consideration could leave the cottage (circled) sandwiched between a communications tower (left) and a 40metre wind turbine (in red)

Mrs Rijks, who lives at Upton Fold Farm, where the cottage is based, has run the business for three years. She said: 'I run a holiday let called Best View in Britain - it’s clearly not going to be that anymore, not with a wind turbine in the way.

'It will ruin our beautiful open views.'

If the turbine is built, her farm will be sandwiched between it and Bosley Tower - a reinforced concrete telecommunications mast owned by BT which will be powered by the turbine.

Mrs Rijks added: 'They say they can’t put the turbine within a 300 metre radius of the tower because of the electromagnetic interference, but they are happy to put it within 300 metres of us.'

On a national scale, concerns have been raised over the health impact of living near a wind turbine, with those affected claiming to suffer from dizziness, increased blood pressure, and depression.

Mr Waller says the electricity will be sold to BT or put back in the National Grid, and the development is part of ongoing efforts to improve energy efficiency and sustainability.

He said: 'We have been researching and discussing, exhaustively, the possibilities of generating our own electricity for nearly four years.'

It emerged earlier this month that energy suppliers were paid over £34million over 12 months to switch turbines off in high winds.

The arrangement compensates them for the National Grid's inability to cope with the extra energy produced during high winds.

Nevertheless, up to 32,000 wind turbines could be built in England and Wales over the next 40 years to meet carbon reduction targets. Many of the existing sites are owned by foreign firms which have made record profits in recent years.
