A British chef has died after inhaling a lethal dose of laughing gas at his home it France, it was revealed today.

Jordan Guise, 21, was found dead at his flat in Beziers, south west France, after experimenting with nitrous oxide - a legal high used as an anaesthetic and an aerosol propellant.

His body was found by the boss of the La Charniere restaurant where he was head chef, after he failed to turn up for work.

laughing gas

A verdict of accidental death had now been recorded by a French coroner after the tragedy on February 6, a French judicial spokesman confirmed.

His family from Kidderminster, West Midlands, said Jordan has recently discovered he and his girlfriend were expecting their first baby in September.

His mother Leesa Malpas said Jordan had called just two days before his death to say he was due to become a father.

She told their local paper the Halesowen News: ‘We were laughing and joking with him. He phoned and told us on the Tuesday and died on the Thursday.

‘Jordan didn't turn up for work on Thursday so Jordan's boss went round and found him in his flat. We do know that he died painlessly. He was very relaxed.

The chef, originally from Kidderminster, West Midlands, had just told his family his girlfriend was pregnant

Mr Guise had just been named head chef at this British-French restaurant in Beziers when he died

‘The cause of Jordan's sudden demise is ironic - it was a substance that is freely available and a legal high - laughing gas - that actually took his life.’

‘Jordan loved his new life and career and although away from friends and family was determined to make something of himself.

Jordan moved to work in France after training as a chef at The Granary Hotel restaurant in Shenstone.

Ms Malpas added: ‘He lived his dream - to be a head chef in France. He was passionate about his work and was very proud of himself, as were his family, friends and work colleagues.’

The mother of his unborn baby had now moved back to England, and a Facebook page had now been set up to raise the 3,500 pounds needed to return his body to Britain, his father Michael Guise said.

An inquest in England has been opened and adjourned.
