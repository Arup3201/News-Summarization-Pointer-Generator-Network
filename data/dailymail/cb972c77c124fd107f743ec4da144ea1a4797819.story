Northern Ireland's Jonathan Rea claimed back-to-back race victories at the inaugural Thailand leg of the World Superbike Championship on Sunday.

Rea, on his Kawasaki ZX-10R, enjoyed a dominant weekend in Buriram, firstly taking pole positions and then clinching consecutive lights-to-flag victories on race day.

The wins lifted Rea 10 points clear of nearest rival Leon Haslam at the top of the early-season standings, with 95 points from a possible 100 following this weekend's masterclass and a first and second place in Australia four weeks ago.

A pair of second-place finishes for English rider Haslam at the Chang International Circuit kept him in close contact with Rea in the championship table.

Rea, 28, fended off first team-mate Tom Sykes and then Haslam (Aprilia Racing Team - Red Devils) to take victory by over six seconds in the opening 20-lap race.

It was a similar story in the second race, as Rea was again never headed in claiming his 18th career race win. Haslam was once more his nearest rival, with English rider Alex Lowes (Voltcom Crescent Suzuki) third.

Defending world champion Sylvain Guintoli (Pata Honda) finished the races in fifth and sixth places, looking for more from his bike when the series continues in Spain in three weeks.
