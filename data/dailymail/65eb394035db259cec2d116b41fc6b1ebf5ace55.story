A Pulitzer Prize-winning TV reporter has been arrested for urinating in public and biting a security guard during a St Patrick's Day parade.

Charlie LeDuff is also alleged to have called three policewomen 'whores' before becoming involved in a fight at a private party.

The 54-year-old, who reports for Fox 2 News in Detroit, Michigan, allegedly got into a brawl after urinating in the street.

An arrest report said LeDuff, a New York Times best-selling author, bit the finger of security guard Sunny Miller during the booze-fueled brawl.

Miller, 54, said he saw LeDuff urinating in the street and brought him back into the tent where the private party was being held.

He said three women, who were off duty Detroit police officers, walked by and LeDuff called the 'whores'.

When friends of the women took offense at LeDuff, a huge brawl broke out during which Miller's finger was bitten. LeDuff was cited for aggravated assault.

When asked about the incident he said: 'I was invited to come in and have a drink and it turned into a fight.

'I was trying to get guys off me and my brother. That's the way it is. No hard feelings on my end.'

Asked about the public urination, LeDuff added: 'No, I think I was behind the tent, possibly, I don’t know. I’ll have to see a picture. I don’t think so. No reason to get your head stomped.'

LeDuff, whose most recent book is Detroit: An American Autopsy, is known for his eccentric reporting for Fox 2.

In the past, he has eaten cat food live on air and taken a shower next to Detroit political figure Sam Riddle while interviewing him at a gym.
