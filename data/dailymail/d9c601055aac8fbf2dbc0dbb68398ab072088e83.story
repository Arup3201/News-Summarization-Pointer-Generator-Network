Senior Conservatives are insisting that Scottish MPs should be banned from voting on tax, welfare and the NHS if more powers are handed to Edinburgh after a No vote.

There is growing unrest in Westminster over the rapid timetable for ‘devo max’, which would see Scotland handed new powers over income tax and finance.

The move – proposed by former prime minister Gordon Brown – was rapidly agreed by all Westminster parties last week in an attempt to counter a surge in support for independence.

Former Tory Cabinet minister John Redwood said ‘palming England off’ with devolution to cities or regional government would not be enough if Scotland was granted 'devo max'

But MPs are angry that their leaders signed up to the plan, insisting that it should only go ahead if Scottish MPs are thrown out of Westminster or if their voting rights are curtailed. 

The Tories are expected to propose a ‘grand committee’ of English MPs for matters only affecting England. 

A poll found 47 per cent of English voters support the idea, with nine per cent opposed, and there have been calls for a vote to settle the issue before next year’s General Election.

Former Tory Cabinet minister John Redwood said ‘palming England off’ with devolution to cities or regional government would not be enough – and that only an English Parliament would do. Senior Tories including Chancellor George Osborne are said to be sympathetic to the idea.

Ex-Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell told Sky News that letting Scottish and Welsh MPs continue to vote on England-only issues would probably be unsustainable under devo max.

Labour politicians are also concerned about a Yes vote, as 40 of 59 Scottish MPs are Labour. If they were barred from finance votes, then a Labour government could struggle to pass legislation.

Both former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls have concerns over the future of a UK Parliament if Scotland is granted 'devo max' after a No vote

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls is said to have told his shadow Cabinet colleagues: ‘If we give the whole tax-raising power to the Scottish Parliament, how can Scottish Labour MPs vote for a Labour budget in England?’

David Cameron faces a fight to stay in Downing Street if the Scots vote for independence.

A group of Tory MPs are planning to gather the 46 names necessary to trigger a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister, and colleagues claim he would take defeat so keenly that he would step down after a Yes vote.
