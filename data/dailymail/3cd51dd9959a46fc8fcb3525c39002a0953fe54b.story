Rodney Brossart has been jailed for six months thanks in part to evidence from a Predator drone

A U.S. citizen has been jailed thanks to evidence from a Predator drone for the first time.

Police deployed the drone, ordinarily used to track down and assassinate terrorists and militants in countries such as Pakistan and Afghanistan, following a stand-off between officers and farmer Rodney Brossart, who has now been jailed for six months.

Brossart was initially accused - and subsequently cleared - of stealing six cows worth $6,000 (£3,625) from a neighbour. But the drone was used when he refused to allow officers on to his 3,600-acre farm in Lakota, North Dakota - despite them having a warrant.

When police went to collect the lost cattle in the summer of 2011, three of Brossart's sons - Alex, Jacob and Thomas - allegedly confronted Nelson County Sheriff Kelly Janke with rifles and shotguns.

That's when the sheriff summoned a $154 million MQ-9 Predator B drone from nearby Grand Forks Air Force Base, where it was patrolling the US-Canada border for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

Using a handheld device that picked up the video camera footage from the spy plane, Sheriff Janke was able to watch the movements of everyone on the farm.

During a 16-hour standoff, the sheriff and his deputies waited until they could see the remaining Brossarts put down their weapons.

Brossart got a three-year sentence – all but six months of it suspended – for refusing to allow officers on to his land to investigate the cattle theft complaint, according to Fox News.

Meanwhile, charges were dropped against Brossart’s wife and daughter for their alleged involvement. Charges against his three sons are still pending.

Then, dressed in SWAT gear, they stormed the compound and arrested the three Brossart sons. No shots were fired.

It is not known how long it was deployed for or whether it got evidence of the alleged cattle crime.

But the exercise did obtain enough evidence for Brossart and four family members to be arrested ion terrorising charges in November 2011.

Brossart was found not guilty of stealing the cows, but was jailed for six months because of the armed stand-off with police.
