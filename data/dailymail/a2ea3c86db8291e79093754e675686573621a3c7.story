Google has revolutionised the way we use the Internet, quickly rising to almost complete dominance over the search market.

But for all its unerring ability to find what you are looking for, it has - up to now - still used a fairly 'dumb' comparison program to match your search terms to pages stored in its database.

But now, Google has unleashed its latest technology on the world - a 'Knowledge Graph' which can understand the relationships between real-world objects, and bring all this information back to the user.

Instead of simply matching your keywords, Google's technology will try to understand your query, and bring back the information you are looking for on the right-hand-side of the traditional results.

Google says this is a 'critical first step towards building the next generation of search, which taps into the collective intelligence of the web and understands the world a bit more like people do.'

A search for 'Marie Curie' brings up this kind of search box, with suggested follow-up searches suggested in blue

Searching 'Taj Mahal' brings up a map of the Taj Mahal, while also offering other alternatives which the user may be looking for

Google said the search engine pulls the facts, figures and images from across the web - so it is not relying on the traditional search engine trick of pulling data from Wikipedia.

Amit Singhal, Google's senior vice president of engineering, said: 'Search is a lot about discovery - the basic human need to learn and broaden your horizons.

'But searching still requires a lot of hard work by you, the user. So today I’m really excited to launch the Knowledge Graph, which will help you discover new information quickly and easily.'

The redesign, which for now affects only U.S.-based English language users, is gradually being rolled starting Wednesday on desktop, mobile and tablet platforms.

Google plans to eventually expand the new search features outside the U.S. - and many UK users have reported seeing the feature in the last few days.

Many of the results will carry more graphical elements, compared to standard lists of search results, such as maps and pictures of related results.

The offering is the latest example of search companies moving away from offering a list of text-based links as search results.

Google is by far the leader in search, with 66 percent of the U.S. market, according to comScore.

But it sees other sites such as Facebook as competition, as users there can poll their friends and acquaintances for information on various topics without leaving the Facebook ecosystem.

Under the new system, many users will end their Internet search without leaving Google's pages, when in the past they might have continued to a site such as Wikipedia, which is collaborating with Google on the new search features.    

Google said it could actually drive more traffic to Wikipedia, which will be prominently linked to in the summary boxes.

The new techniques are based in large part on work done at online data collection Freebase, Singhal said. Freebase was developed by Metaweb, a company Google acquired in 2010.

Google is also working on being able to better answer more complex questions such as 'What are the ten deepest lakes in Africa?' that require its algorithms to factor in several different criteria.

But it may never be able to crack some users' toughest questions, such as 'Does my hairstyle make me look fat?' which Singhal said was a real user query.

He said: 'We are not magicians - we are just computer science geeks.'

Similarly, Google yesterday revealed the 'Research Pane', which provides a similar service while writing in Google Documents

Explaining the concept, Singhal said: 'Take a query like [taj mahal]. For more than four decades, search has essentially been about matching keywords to queries. To a search engine the words [taj mahal] have been just that - two words.

'But we all know that [taj mahal] has a much richer meaning. You might think of one of the world’s most beautiful monuments, or a Grammy Award-winning musician, or possibly even a casino in Atlantic City, NJ. Or, depending on when you last ate, the nearest Indian restaurant.

'It’s why we’ve been working on an intelligent model - in geek-speak, a 'graph' - that understands real-world entities and their relationships to one another: things, not strings.

'The Knowledge Graph enables you to search for things, people or places that Google knows about - landmarks, celebrities, cities, sports teams, buildings, geographical features, movies, celestial objects, works of art and more - and instantly get information that’s relevant to your query.

'This is a critical first step towards building the next generation of search, which taps into the collective intelligence of the web and understands the world a bit more like people do.'

He continued: 'Google’s Knowledge Graph isn’t just rooted in public sources such as Freebase, Wikipedia and the CIA World Factbook. It’s also augmented at a much larger scale - because we’re focused on comprehensive breadth and depth.

'It currently contains more than 500million objects, as well as more than 3.5billion facts about and relationships between these different objects. And it's tuned based on what people search for, and what we find out on the web.

'How do we know which facts are most likely to be needed for each item? For that, we go back to our users and study in aggregate what they’ve been asking Google about each item.

'For example, people are interested in knowing what books Charles Dickens wrote, whereas they’re less interested in what books Frank Lloyd Wright wrote, and more in what buildings he designed.

Google Documents - which has now been re-christened Google Drive - got a similar 'knowledge treatment' this week.

As you type into Google's online word processor, Google can return facts and images about your subject.

Users can specify if they want Docs - which has recently been re-christened as Drive by Google - to search all of Google, or just keep searches restricted to images and quotes.

Google software engineer Sarveshwar Dudd said: 'If you find something you like, you can add it by clicking the insert button or, for images, by dragging them directly into your document.

'From the research pane, you can search for whatever info you need to help you write your document. With just a couple clicks you can look up maps, quotes, images, and much more.

'If appropriate we'll automatically add a footnote citation so there's a record of where you found the info.'

'The Knowledge Graph also helps us understand the relationships between things. Marie Curie is a person in the Knowledge Graph, and she had two children, one of whom also won a Nobel Prize, as well as a husband, Pierre Curie, who claimed a third Nobel Prize for the family. All of these are linked in our graph. It’s not just a catalog of objects; it also models all these inter-relationships. It’s the intelligence between these different entities that’s the key.

'We’ve always believed that the perfect search engine should understand exactly what you mean and give you back exactly what you want. And we can now sometimes help answer your next question before you’ve asked it, because the facts we show are informed by what other people have searched for.

'For example, the information we show for Tom Cruise answers 37 percent of next queries that people ask about him.

'We’ve begun to gradually roll out this view of the Knowledge Graph to U.S. English users. It’s also going to be available on smartphones and tablets.

'We’re proud of our first baby step - the Knowledge Graph - which will enable us to make search more intelligent, moving us closer to the "Star Trek computer" that I've always dreamed of building.

'Enjoy your lifelong journey of discovery, made easier by Google Search, so you can spend less time searching and more time doing what you love.'
