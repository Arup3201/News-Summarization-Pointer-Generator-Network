Bayern Munich ended their Bundesliga season in style, claiming victory against Stuttgart thanks to a 92nd minute Claudio Pizarro goal before collecting the Bundesliga shield.

Pizarro, a 64th minute substitute for Mario Mandzukic, is out of contract this summer but if he has played his last game for the club he has ensured he leaves on a high.

Pep Guardiola named a strong side for the final league game of the season, including Javi Martinez who has been linked with a summer move to Arsenal, and Manchester United target Thomas Muller.

Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger limped out of the game in the 37th minute after picking up a knock, days after being named in Joachim Low's squad for the 2014 World Cup.

The injury was not sufficiently bad for the midfielder to miss out on the post-match celebrations which saw the players celebrate in front of 71,000 fans at the Allianz Arena.

And Guardiola also showed a different side to his personality, soaking his players in champagne before they returned the favour and left the former Barcelona manager drenched as he posed for pictures with his side's silverware.
