Luiz Felipe
 Scolari and Thiago Silva, once safely ensconced in the city whose name 
means ‘Fortress’, started to fight back after a bruising few days.

Silva
 responded to claims that his tears during the penalty shootout win 
against Chile proved he was too emotional to captain Brazil with a 
reminder of his successful battles on and off the pitch, which include 
fighting for his life when he spent six months in hospital with TB.

Scolari,
 in his own inimitable bar-room style, told Brazilian reporters to ‘go 
to hell’ if they didn’t like the fact that he leaked information to a 
select group of friends in the media.

That was the mood here before Friday's World Cup quarter-final against Colombia.

Brazil
 have been under intense scrutiny since the nailbiting win against 
Chile, when they scraped into the last eight with good fortune, 
penalties and the lucky religious charm of the reserve goalkeeper, while
 the press officer has been charged by FIFA for attacking one of the 
Chilean team.

No-one
 took more flak than Silva. He seemed to be an emotional wreck during 
the shootout in Belo Horizonte but his bond with Scolari is strong.

‘He
 is my commander and he never went against me,’ said Silva. ‘I don’t 
care what people think because no one knows me. I just think about my 
job. This is the way I am. I am emotional and it’s a natural thing for a
 human being to be emotional.

‘It
 doesn’t affect me at any time on the pitch. I think it helps me. People
 are saying silly things. I don’t think it makes any difference. I have 
overcome many things in life. I overcame tuberculosis. I fought for my 
life.’

Perhaps
 it was the Fortaleza factor which stiffened their resolve. It was in 
this northern city of 2.5 million that the extended a cappella national 
anthem was born during last year’s Confederations Cup.

Outside
 the stadium, 30,000 protesters were clashing in the streets with riot 
police as public opinion was turning against World Cup largesse.

Inside,
 Scolari’s players locked arms and sang the anthem as they had never 
sung it before and, when the music stopped after the FIFA-regulation 90 
seconds, they sang some more, led by Silva and David Luiz. They 
roared on, into the second stanza which includes the words: Thou wilt 
see a son of thine flees not from battle. And the Fortaleza fans, proud
 to have the team back in their city for the first time in more than a 
decade, went with them.

It
 stirred the soul and soon became an established element of Scolari’s 
team. Through the rest of the Confederations Cup, which they won, and 
into this World Cup, the Brazilians sang the second verse of their 
national anthem without music.

Others
 followed, notably South American nations with meandering anthems. It is
 a token of resistance to the 90-second limit, another unnecessary FIFA 
rule squeezing identity from the game, like the guidelines on team 
colours which have England and Germany playing in all-white and Spain in
 all-red.

For
 Brazil, however, the anthem is special: their very own haka; a 
goose-pimpling pre-match ritual and display of unity; a nation together 
behind the Selecao in spite of everything; a nation willing this flawed 
team to a sixth world title.

Whether it actually helps has been the 
subject of heated debate, fuelled when Scolari summoned his trusted 
sports psychologist Regina Brandao to the team’s mountain retreat in 
Teresopolis. ‘She isn’t paid,’ rapped Big Phil. ‘They love going to talk
 to her, in a meeting or on the phone.’

Support
 gathered for the idea of taking the captaincy from Silva and giving it 
to Luiz. ‘Crying is normal, but he needs to stop,’ said Cafu, the last 
Brazilian to lift the World Cup.

Fabio
 Capello talked about the weight of the England shirt but it cannot 
compare to a nation of more than 200 million who will not be satisfied 
until the Maracanazo defeat by Uruguay in 1950 is exorcised.

The
 pressure is intense and no-one is under more than Neymar, who spent 90 
minutes fielding media questions. He also told Brazil what it wanted to 
hear: a knee injury will not stop him playing.

Colombia have been in fluent form but they have beaten Brazil only twice and not for 23 years and never on Brazilian soil.

Brazil
 have won seven of 12 since Colombia’s last win in the Copa America in 
Chile. The last four matches have been drawn and Scolari told how he 
expects a more even game against a team committed to open and attacking 
football.

‘Does Brazil continue with a hand on the cup?’ asked Big Phil, before answering his own question.

‘Yes. We are on the fifth step. There are seven steps. Our supporters don’t expect anything different. We continue.’

It was fighting talk in Brazil’s fortress city.
