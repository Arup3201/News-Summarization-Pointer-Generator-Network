Eurostar has banned Daniel Confino for life after he was kicked off a train for complaining about the strength of his cup of tea

Eurostar has banned a passenger for life after kicking him off a train for complaining about the strength of his cup of tea.

Daniel Confino, a financial expert who was instrumental in saving the foundering Eurotunnel project in the Nineties, now intends to have the ban ruled illegal at the High Court.

The 56-year-old was furious to be told by email that he will never be allowed back on a Eurostar train unless he proves he can be ‘courteous and polite’.

Last night the father of four described the ban as ‘ridiculous, repugnant and ‘draconian’ after trying to buy another ticket and having it cancelled.

The row began when he was returning with a colleague to St Pancras on September 6 after a conference in Paris. In the buffet car he ordered two teas at £2.20 each – and asked for an extra bag so he could have a strong cuppa. 

However, when he was charged £2.20 just for the third tea bag, he complained.

Staff refused to back down and after a heated row he left the untouched teas and extra Duchy Organic tea bag on the counter and walked off mouthing the words ‘idiotic bitches’.

But the buffet car staff said they felt threatened and the train made an unscheduled stop at Ebbsfleet in Kent where Mr Confino was bundled off by police, accused of trying to steal a tea bag. 

Mr Confino, of Brockley, south-east London, only found out he had been banned for life after buying a single to Calais to pick up his car from a house he owns in northern France on December 3.

Two days before travelling, he received an email from Eurostar telling him the ticket had been cancelled and he was banned.

After calling Marc Noaro, Eurostar’s service and people director, Mr Confino emailed him to claim he was being punished for complaining about service. An hour later, he received a reply stating: ‘We have decided you should not be permitted to travel on Eurostar services. Any other booking made by you will be cancelled. The above decision is final.’

The email added that the firm would only reconsider if Mr Confino apologised in writing to the staff he rowed with and can convince them his behaviour will be ‘courteous and polite’ in future.

Mr Confino had already threatened Eurostar with legal action over the original row, claiming he had suffered ‘degrading treatment, mental distress and anxiety’.

Last night he said: ‘I am being blackmailed into making an apology and dropping my case. They are just bullies, abusing their monopoly and using brute force to require me to drop my claims. And despite all this they haven’t even changed their policy on their tea.’

Ironically, Mr Confino helped to keep the Eurotunnel dream alive when it looked as if it might fail. In 1993, when he worked at the bank Hill Samuel, the Department for Transport called him in to advise on the project as costs spiralled.

He and his team managed to get extra bank funding to keep it on track. 

Last night, Mr Confino, who part owns the tea firm Yumchaa, said: ‘When I have a builder’s tea I like a proper stand-up job.

‘In every other situation where I have asked for an extra bag everyone has agreed – apart from Eurostar. Now they ban me. Anyone who believes in the rule of law will see this is repugnant.’

Eurostar declined to comment last night.

This is an extract from the email sent to Mr Confino on December 1 by Marc Noaro, Eurostar director of service and people:

Dear Mr Confino, following our telephone conversation earlier today I confirm Eurostar’s decision not to permit you to travel on Wednesday 3 December.

Eurostar will not in any way tolerate abuse of its staff. As a result of your behaviour on 6 September and your subsequent emails we have decided that, in accordance with Eurostar’s Conditions of Carriage, you should not be permitted to travel on Eurostar services.

Any other booking made by you will be cancelled. We will review our decision when:

1. You provide a written apology to the members of crew working on the 20:13 train from Paris on 6 September; and

2. We are confident that your behaviour towards Eurostar personnel will be appropriately courteous and polite.

The above decision is final.
