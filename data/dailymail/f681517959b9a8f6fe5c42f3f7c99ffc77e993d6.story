A mother is claiming she was duped under false pretenses into giving up her child for adoption to the son of the former mayor of Oklahoma City and now wants her baby back.

Heather Bazzle says she gave up her son, Max, to Lance Norick and his wife Darcy in September, but before the adoption was finalized she discovered the couple were getting a divorce.

The couple have since split to live in Arizona and Oklahoma while Max is now living with former mayor Ron Norick - a situation which Bazzle calls a 'failed adoption'.

Teary: Heather Bazzle wants her son Max back from Lance and Darcy Norick because they divorced and did not tell her their marriage was in trouble during the adoption process

Bazzle, who is already the mother of three, decided to give up her unborn son because she could not financially support him.

She told KFOR.com that she remembers thinking, 'How am I going to give this child everything I can?'

A meeting with an adoption attorney led to the recommendation of Lance and Darcy Norck, who then both lived in Arizona.

Bazzle said, 'They seemed like the perfect couple', and they were both present for Max's birth.

However, before the final paperwork went through, Bazzle discovered they were to split and she filed her emergency custody application because she believes the couple misrepresented themselves.

'That’s my baby. I love him,' Bazzle said.

'I’m trying to do what’s best for him, and even though I may have made a mistake placing him for adoption, I feel like God’s giving me a chance now to fix that and to be there for him.'

However, an adoption expert in Oklahoma City told KFOR.com that the process Bazzle would have gone through would have been very specific.

'The judge asks, 'you understand that forever is a long time?' said Jim Ikard,

'The mothers say, 'Yes, I do.'

He added that it would be up to Bazzle to prove fraud had taken place - which he said would be very difficult.

In addition, the fact that they had legally declared their custody originally to not be in the 'best interests' of the child would hinder any future claims.

'And so the question gets to be, if you don’t like this couple, it’s not a matter of you getting the child back. It’s finding another couple,' Ikard said.

Bazzle said, 'I don’t feel like I can give my son to anybody and trust anybody with him anymore.'
