It's looks set to be a 'bark humbug' Christmas for these two dogs as they peer forlornly into the camera wearing a range of festive hats.

Travis, 10, and Gus, four, couldn't look less enthusiastic about the holiday season in these pictures taken by Canadian photographer, and their owner, Steph McCombie, 33, from Vancouver.

And if they weren't embarrassing enough, the images have been plastered all over an Instagram account dedicated to the German Shorthaired Pointers.

Sick to the back wreath: The festive pictures were taken by Canadian photographer, and their owner, Steph McCombie, 33, from Vancouver

But the truth is the patient pets are consummate professionals and have posed for dozens of photos for their owner in other items of clothing from Parker coats to balaclavas and birthday hats to Batman masks.

Steph says: 'Gus took a few weeks to warm to Travis. He just kind of pretended Travis wasn't here. Now they're like brothers.

Big ears: Steph adopted Gus (left) after falling in love with him on the website Pet Finder. She says it was love ever since

Lucky escape: She says Gus had 48 hours left before he was put down before she 'busted him out'

Snug as a dog in a rug: From their Instagram account, Travis and Gus share their cute friendship with the world, and despite coming from different countries, they act like brothers, says Steph (left, holding Gus)

Bow-wow tie: Travis and Gus have only been friends for a year

'I adopted Gus after falling in love with him on the website Pet Finder. He was only a nine month old puppy.

'They told me he had 48 hours left before they put him down, so I busted him out.

'I bought him a one way plane ticket to Vancouver and it's been true love ever since.

'For a budding photographer they're the best models a girl could hope for, and there's lots of treats involved, so they're very tolerant.'
