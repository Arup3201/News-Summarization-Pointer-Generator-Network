A coroner has critised television programmes for trivialising the condition of compulsive hoarding after a pensioner died in a fire at her home which was filled floor to ceiling with rubbish.

Firefighters had to spend 30 minutes tunneling through stacks of rubbish in a desperate bid to rescue Ann Bradshaw, 65.

Her inquest heard that she might have survived the blaze had emergency services got to her sooner.

'Dangerous circumstances': The coroner said firefighters had to battle through a 'staggering' amount of stuff to try to rescue Ann Bradshaw

Firefighter Glen Crookes said getting up the stairs to reach Mrs Bradshaw was like 'swimming in shale'

County Durham and Darlington Coroner 
Andrew Tweddle said the stack of belongings was so deep the firefighters
 could also have died during the rescue.

He
 hit out at the prime-time shows - such as Channel 4's 'The Hoarder Next
 Door' and 'Obsessive Compulsive Hoarder, and the BBC documentary 'My 
Hoarder Mum And Me' - which have 'made light' of the most extreme cases 
of compulsive hoarding for purposes of entertainment.

He is calling for more to be done to highlight the dangers and consequences of hoarding.

Mr
 Tweddle added that the inquest strongly emphasised the risks that 
hoarders pose to themselves, and also others, including members of the 
fire service, who may be called to try and affect a rescue in the most 
difficult of circumstances.

He said: 'Hoarding has even reached the TV and it is almost made light of and obviously makes good TV.'

'However, this shows that 
people are at grave risk to themselves, potentially their neighbours, 
but equally to those who try to save lives.'

When
 fire crews arrived at Mrs Bradshaw’s home in Newton Aycliffe, County 
Durham, on May 14 last year neighbours warned them they would struggle 
to get inside because of her hoarding.

Mr Tweddle said: 'The conditions were quite extreme on a number of levels.'

'The
 physical state of the property with the amount of stuff is quite 
staggering and made the job of the firefighters quite difficult and 
dangerous.

'It would have been so easy to have two dead firefighters on the day.

'Therefore
 there should be significant praise for the firefighters for their 
determination in the face of extreme and dangerous circumstances to try 
and rescue Ann Bradshaw.'

It was so bad that her 37-year-old son Ian, who lived with her, would spend two hours moving items each time he wanted to leave.

Having
 rescued Mr Bradshaw from an upstairs bathroom window, firefighters were
 unable to reach his mother, despite repeated attempts.

When
 they finally got through the front door, they reported there was little
 space to carry out a search and the staircase was like a tunnel due to 
all the belongings.

The 
blaze was caused by an electrical fault after an extension cable running
 under the clutter was rubbed down to the bare wire by people walking 
past the items.

It was one of the hottest blazes fire crews reported having ever faced.

Firefighter Glen Crookes said getting up the stairs to reach Mrs Bradshaw was like 'swimming in shale'.

He had to use his hands to provide his colleague Graeme Norman with a platform to reach the first floor.

Crew manager Andrew Ellison said: 'We 
smashed a back window and the stuff in the house was about a foot from 
the top of the room. It was too dangerous. It was impossible to get in.

'I
 had hold of her arm when I was up the ladder but I couldn’t reach her 
enough to pull her out. I did fear for my own safety. The smoke was so 
thick and black.'

Mrs Bradshaw died at the scene from smoke inhalation.

She
 had been in discussions with social housing provider livin, which 
managed the house, weeks before the incident over her hoarding problem.

Mr Tweddle plans to write to social housing providers about hoarding in the hope it will reduce the risk to both individuals and the emergency services.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, Mr Tweddle also called into question the radios used by firefighters after a malfunction believed to have been caused when climbing the stairs left them unable to confirm any change of plan with the rescue.

He said although it did not contribute to Mrs Bradshaw’s death, he would be writing to the fire brigade to see if new measures could be put in place.

Alan Boddy, livin’s executive director for people and communities, said: 'As the tenant was clearly overwhelmed by the amount of items that had accumulated in her home, livin’s community co-ordinator was working closely with the family and making good progress in supporting them to clear the vast amount of items being hoarded.

'We have also run articles in our tenants magazine and on our website to highlight the dangers of hoarding.'
