A Medicare call centre worker jailed for possessing a haul of 22,000 child porn images kept his job while he was behind bars - by using his annual leave and leave without pay while in prison.

Samuel James Lawless, 31, from Brisbane, is still employed by the Human Services Department despite admitting possessing and transmitting the child pornography between September 2006 and June 2013, The Courier Mail reports. 

Samuel James Lawless has been convicted of collecting child porn and is currently serving time in prison

The Department of Human Services has told Daily Mail Australia that it 'cannot discuss matters relating to individual staff'.

But a spokesman added: 'Generally speaking, the department will consider appropriate disciplinary action as soon as it becomes aware that an employee has been convicted of a criminal offence.

'Where any matter is identified as possibly breaching the APS Code of Conduct, it is referred to the department’s Conduct Standards Team for consideration.

'Serious breaches generally result in termination of employment.' 

Lawless is due to be released from Wolston Correctional Centre within a matter of weeks and authorities are investigating whether his employment should end, reports Channel 9. 

Marise Payne, Human Services Minister, told Channel 9 all government employees were expected to abide by the Australian Public Service code of conduct.

He pleaded guilty to possessing and transmitting the child pornography between September 2006 and June 2013 and is in prison weeks away from finishing his jail sentence

A department spokeswoman said paid leave is not normally agreed when the department is aware that the employee is serving a jail sentence.

A spokesman for Queensland Police told Daily Mail Australia they could not comment on the case.
