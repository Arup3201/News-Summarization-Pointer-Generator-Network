Circumcision is becoming less common is the United States and there is a direct correlation between uncircumcised males and increased risk for diseases such as HIV and HPV, says a new study by Mayo Clinic.

Brian Morris, coauthor of the new report and professor emeritus in the School of Medical Sciences at the University of Sydney said that 'Infancy circumcision should be regarded as equivalent to childhood vaccination.'

CBS News reports that the American Academy of Pediatrics came out with a public statement in 2012 that supported education and access to infant male circumcision.

Doctors argue that circumcision should be as commonplace as childhood vaccination because of it's ability to prevent sexually transmitted infections

Circumcision among newborns has declined from 83 per cent in the 1960s to 77 per cent in 2010.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that the circumcision rates of US males aged 14 to 89 is 81 per cent.

There is also a racial disparity of those receiving circumcision with those who did not that's based around cultural and educational factors.

In the last decade 91 per cent of white Americans are circumcised, 76 per cent of black men are circumcised and 44 per cent of Hispanic men are circumcised.

The authors of the paper hypothesize that as the Hispanic population in the U.S. starts tp rise, families within that demographic are less familiar with circumcision and its health benefits.

A gap in Health Insurance access for Americans has resulted in families opting out of circumcision procedures in order to save money.

Circumcision boasts an array of health benefits including UTI prevention in infants and adults.

Circumcision is also known to lower one's risk for contracting HIV and HPV, the latter of which can cause genital warts and even some cancers.

CBS reports that a study published in the Journal of American medicine found reviewed more than 500 studies and found that circumcision reduces risk for HIV in straight males by 60 per cent, genital her4pes by 30 per cent, and cancer causing HPV by 35 per cent.

Those who oopose circumcision argue that removing the foreskin at any age decreases sensitivity during sexual activity.

Others argue that circumcision is a human rights issue and should be the choice of the child.
