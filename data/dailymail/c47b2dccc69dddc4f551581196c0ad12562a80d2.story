Sleeping pills: Last week Kerry Kennedy blamed a July 11 car accident on a seizure but now blood tests show she was on the sleeping pill, Ambien

Kerry Kennedy pleaded not guilty in court tonight and blamed Friday’s car accident, where she careered into a truck and was later found slumped over the wheel, on a seizure.

Speaking outside court, JFK's daughter claimed numerous neurological tests show that she suffered a 'partial seizure' which was the result of a previous head injury.

'I want to apologise to the driver of the truck who I apparently hit and all those who I apparently endangered,’ she told reporters outside North Castle court in Amonk, New York, this evening.

The 52-year-old twice repeated that no drugs or alcohol were found in her system after the crash.

On Friday, the ex-wife of Governor Cuomo, was 
found by police slumped over her wheel of her 2008 silver-white Lexus RX
 350 at one of the exits of the highway and charged with driving while 
ability impaired by drugs.

Surrounded by relatives this evening, Kennedy also detailed how she underwent an MRI and 'a comprehensive battery of neurological tests' at Mount Sinai medical center after the crash.

‘A MRI showed an area of hypo-density which appears to be the result of a head injury sustained some time ago,' she said. Kennedy concluded that doctors believe the accident was caused by a partial seizure.

She added that this was the only seizure she had ever suffered and would continue to get treatment over 'the months ahead and, perhaps, indefinitely.'

Recalling Friday's accident she said, 'I remember getting onto the highway and then I have no memory until I was at a traffic light and a police officer was at my car door.'

'I have never had any history of drug or alcohol abuse and in my discussion with the police officer I was confused and erratic,' she continued.

She told the officers that she had possibly mixed up two prescription drugs before getting behind the wheel and taken the sleeping pill Ambien instead of a daily prescription that she takes for a thyroid problem.

The driver of the truck Kerry Kennedy 
crashed into on Friday spoke about the accident and recalled how RFK's 
daughter's was driving erratically for more than three miles on the 
Westchester highway before the Lexus slammed into his rig and careered 
off the interstate.

He told 
the New York Post: 'My first impression was that she was really, really 
drunk. She's very lucky she didn't kill somebody.

'I’ve been a truck driver for 22 years. I’m pretty sure she was half-asleep or very, very intoxicated.

'She scared the heck out of a lot of people. She was completely out of it.'

He told the Post that right before the crash, he saw Kennedy's head drop down to the steering wheel before snapping up again and nodding off again, all while veering in and out of lanes.

'She started 
coming at me, like she didn’t see me. She was starting to nod off,
 her head was bobbing toward the steering wheel,' he said.

'I hit the horn. I couldn’t go back into
 the breakdown lane because there was a disabled truck up ahead. I could
 either hit that truck or let her do whatever she was going to do.

'I hit the brakes, but she hit the brakes at the same time and veered right into me.

'When she hit me, my left tire tore up 
her passenger-side door. She woke up a little bit, not a lot — not the way you’d wake up if you’d just hit a 6,000-pound truck.'

Arrested: Kerry Kennedy has been charged with driving while impaired with drugs in New York

One of the tires on her car came free and shot into oncoming traffic and smoke was pouring out of the Lexus, the truck driver said.

Mr Scuitello told the Post he first thought she must be 'really, really 
drunk' and recalled when he saw her she looked like she had just rolled 
out of bed.

Kennedy gave blood and urine samples at a nearby police barracks, which she said Tuesday evening showed that she had no alcohol or drugs in her system.

On Sunday, one of Kennedy's family claimed she had had a seizure behind the wheel, which caused her to crash. 

Friday's collision came just two months
 after her best friend and sister-in-law Mary committed suicide after 
struggling with alcoholism and drug abuse.

Ms Kennedy, 52, crashed into the big rig 
about 8am om Friday then drove off the highway. The collision damaged 
her car and left it with a flat tire.

Police arrived at the scene after a 911 call reported erratic driving on the freeway.

They then discovered Ms Kennedy passed out at the wheel of the white 2008 Lexus RS 350. There were no passengers.

Ken Sunshine told the New York Times: 'Kerry Kennedy voluntarily took breathalyzer, blood and urine tests – all of which showed no drugs or alcohol whatsoever in her system.

Ambien: Ms Kennedy said she was 'confused and erratic' when she told officers she may have taken the sleeping pill Ambien, which has been known in rare cases to cause 'sleep-driving'. But on Wednesday she said her 'first instinct' appears to be right after tests showed it WAS in her system the day of the crash

The 'Ambien defense' is a relatively new strategy that has been successfully used to clear drivers who had taken the medication before being arrested for operating a vehicle while intoxicated.

Doctors have recorded rare cases of the drug causing people to eat, walk and even get behind the wheel of a car while under the effects of the popular sedative. In those cases, the patients claimed to have no memory of their actions. As a result, courts have found they are not criminally liable for their actions.

However, most successful uses of the defense argument have come in cases where the defendants were found during normal sleeping times and often when they were discovered wearing pajamas.

Ms Kennedy, one of the most prominent members of the legendary Kennedy family, is the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy and the niece of President John F. Kennedy.

Celebration: Ms Kennedy with Mr Cuomo during his first New York gubernatorial campaign in 2002

Her father was Senator for New York then U.S. Attorney General before being assassinated during his 1968 presidential campaign.

She re-entered the public eye as the wife of Mr Cuomo, a member of Bill Clinton's cabinet who was elected as Governor of New York in 2010.

The couple have three children but divorced in 2005 after 13 years of marriage.

Ms Kennedy was best friends with her sister-in-law Mary Richardson Kennedy, who killed herself at her New York home in May after her marriage to Robert F. Kennedy Jr disintegrated.

Kerry delivered an emotional eulogy at Mary's funeral, describing her friend as an 'angel' who had been destroyed by her own 'forces of evil'.
