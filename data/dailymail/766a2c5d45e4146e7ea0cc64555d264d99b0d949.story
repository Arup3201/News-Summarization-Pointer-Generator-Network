Samantha Cherry's baby son was handed a bottle of bleach by a complete stranger in a fast food restaurant in 2011

Jonjo Freed's grandmother looked away from his pram for just a second or two as she waited for her daughter to buy ice cream in their local McDonald's.

But it's an act that still haunts her, as in those few seconds her precious 11-month-old grandson had been handed a baby bottle filled with bleach by a complete stranger.

After drinking from the bottle Jonjo choked and vomited violently but survived thanks to the swift reactions of grandmother Mandy Cherry and his mother Samantha Cherry.

Elaine Joyner, 53, from Deptford in south-east London, has since been found to have committed the act and detained in a mental health hospital. As well as attempting to poison Jonjo she has committed several other acts of violence against young children.

Recently the order protecting Jonjo's identity has been lifted and today Mandy and Samantha appeared on This Morning to talk about the ordeal, and explain that they don't feel any anger towards the boy's attacker, but ask why she was allowed to remain free when she was obviously a risk to the public.

Mandy described how a quick family lunch to McDonald's on Eltham High Street, September 13, 2011, almost turned to tragedy: 'It was just a normal everyday situation. Nothing out of the ordinary at all. Jonjo was in the aisle in a big pram because he was quite young.

'My one mistake was glancing out the window, or maybe I drank my coffee and took my eye off him. It's something that I'll regret forever.

'I heard him coughing and choking so immediately my eyes were back on him. I thought he was choking on a chip.Â

'But he was white and he was frothing and he was scared. He was frothing and retching as I picked him up and a bottle dropped on to the floor - the type he drinks out of all of the time.

'It was an orange liquid, wheras he normally drinks milk or water.

'When Sam retruned she said "What have you done?", so I said "What have YOU done? What have you given him in this bottle?".'

Samantha added: 'I knew straight away that it wasn't his bottle. I took the lid off but I didn't need to taste it I could smell it.

'Mum screamed "Has anybody seen somebody give this baby a bottle?".'

Mandy added: 'It was only at that point that we realised something had taken place.

'You don't think anyone is going to poison a child. It's the last thing you actually think of.'

Two customers - who became vital 
witnesses in the case against Elaine Joyner - revealed that they had 
seen a woman drop a bottle into the pram. CCTV later confirmed that it 
took just three to five seconds for the dangerous bottle to be within the baby's grasp.

Jonjo was taken into hospital and survived without any serious injury. The 
liquid in the bottle was tested and found to be acid but not pure bleach,
 which could have burnt his trachea, and meant long-term damage 
or even death.

Today Jonjo, now three years old, is perfectly well and appeared unfazed by the incident as he joined his 
mother and grandmother on the sofa at the end of the interview.

His attacker, who has a history of wanting to harm children, remains indefinitely in a mental health hospital. When asked about her Jonjo's mother Samantha told Philip Schofield: 'She needed help 
and she needed to be put away somewhere safe where she couldn't harm 
anybody else.'

Mandy added: 'I
 don't feel anger towards her, because if it's a mental issue you can't 
help that anymore than you can help having anything, but she should have 
been dealt with before she got to danger point.'
