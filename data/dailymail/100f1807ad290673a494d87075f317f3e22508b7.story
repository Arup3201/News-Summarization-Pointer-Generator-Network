The international airline pilot who was carrying almost $900,000 in cash when he and his wife were arrested has told a Melbourne court he must clear his name.

Finnish national Lauri Metsaranta, 35, said a conviction on the charge of handling the proceeds of crime would end his career as a Finnair pilot on long-haul routes.

Failing to appear at his trial would effectively do the same, he said, as Interpol would declare him a fugitive, making passage though airports impossible.

'I must have my name cleared because as a fugitive, or a convicted felon, it would be very difficult to continue my job,' Metsaranta told the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Thursday.

'I know the company policies - just getting the security clearance to go through the airport would be very unlikely if I am convicted.'

Magistrate Ann Collins agreed and granted bail, allowing Metsaranta to return to Finland.

He must also pay a $100,000 surety to be forfeited should Metsaranta fail to return to Australia for his trial expected in early 2015.

Metsaranta had spent five months in custody, after he and his Chinese wife Changchen Chen were arrested outside a Melbourne hotel.

Lauri Metsaranta is now trying to clear his name in the Melbourne Magistrates Court so he can continue to work as a Finnair pilot on long-haul flights

Cash totalling $899,460 was found in two bags, according to an Australian Federal Police statement tended to the court.

The court was also told Ms Chen, and another Asian man involved in handing over the cash, had pleaded guilty to proceeds of crime charges.

'There is no evidence (Metsaranta) had any knowledge of the money before he got to the hotel room,' his lawyer Michael Gleeson also told the court.

The date for Metsaranta's trial will be set at a hearing in the Victorian County Court on Friday.
