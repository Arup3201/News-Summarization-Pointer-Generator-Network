From Zoe Jordan to Holly Fulton, John Rocha and Julien Macdonald, there's been no shortage of talented designers taking to the catwalk at Somerset House over the last two days.

But one of the world's biggest fashion names chose to give proceedings a miss - in favour of attending a film screening.

Vogue editor Anna Wintour joined Colin Firth's eco-warrior wife Livia and Karl Lagerfeld's former muse Amanda Harlech for the premiere of environmental fashion film Handprint at the W London hotel in Leicester Square.

The film, which was directed by Mary Nighy and stars American actress and model Elettra Wiedemann, aims to promote awareness of the conditions endured by third world garment workers.

Clothing factories in countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia and Cambodia are used by numerous high street and designer names, and until recently, many were also reported to use child labour.

The squalid conditions faced by workers made headlines earlier this year, when eight-storey garment factory Rana Plaza in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, collapsed, killing 1,129 people and injuring more than 2,500.

Others involved in making Handprint included Net-a-Porter founder, Natalie Massanet, and Caroline Rush, chairman of the British Fashion Council.

Wintour, resplendent in a classic trench coat with bright yellow cuffs, appeared to enjoy the short film, although it seems the British weather failed to meet with her approval.

'I enjoyed the film and felt proud of
 the accomplishment of Mary (Nighy),' said the Vogue supremo, before adding: 'Despite the rain I am 
enjoying London so far.'

While the eco film was the main topic of post-screening conversation, Amanda Harlech was overheard discussing her daughter Tallulah's career prospects, telling friends she hoped she would become an actress.

And despite her passion for fashion, Harlech, who wore a typically chic Dior Homme jacket, a Prada jumper and 
a Balenciaga dress, said she would be missing fashion week this time - with the exception of hotly tipped Northern Irish designer JW Anderson.
