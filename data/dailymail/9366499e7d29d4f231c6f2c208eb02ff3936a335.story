It’s never too late to teach your dog how to act more humanlike – with the right device.

One man’s greyhound kept scratching at his doors to get outside, so he invented a 'doggy doorbell’ to keep it from ruining the wooden doors around his home.

Keith Jin of Eugene, Oregon, invented the device to allow his dog Pebble to better let him know when it needs to go outside and get back in, KVAL-TV reports.

No more door scratching: See Pebble ring the doorbell to get outside

The portable, mountable device, which Jin named ‘Pebble Smart,’ rests on the inside and outside walls by his front door at about the same height as Pebble’s elongated snout.

It has a big yellow pad with a space behind it to insert treats.

That is how Jin trained Pebble to use the doorbell.

Now Pebble knows the best way to get her owner’s attention when she needs to go outside.

The ‘Pebble Smart’ doorbell has been so successful, Jin told KVAL that he is looking to create doorbells for other domesticated animals.

‘Cats can use this,’ he said. ‘I think eventually we’ll make a version especially for cats.’
