Police in Nevada have arrested a man suspected of tying a bowling ball to a dog and drowning it in a Northern California river.

William Meek, 47, was on the run for nearly five months before police in Reno, Nevada finally tracked him down on Tuesday, The Sacramento Bee reports. 

Officials say the border collie was found floating in the American River in Sacramento on June 16. The dog had a leash on its collar that was tied to a bag containing a bowling ball and large rock.

City animal care manager Gina Knepp says the dog had a microchip that officials traced to a Sacramento woman, who turned out to be Meek's girlfriend. 

The woman, who was remained unidentified, told authorities that she gave the 12-year-old dog named Zelda to Meeks to drop off at a shelter after the dog bit someone. 

Instead, Meeks took the dog to a stretch of the American River and drowned the poor animal. 

A necropsy revealed that there was water in Zelda's lungs and that the dog was alive and struggled to breathe in its last moments. 

The dog's carcass was found several days later by someone walking along the river. 

Meek is currently being held on charges of malicious maiming of animals and possession of a controlled substance. Arrest records show he has a history of using methamphetamine.

Sacramento authorities are seeking Meek's extradition to California. It wasn't immediately known if he has a lawyer.
