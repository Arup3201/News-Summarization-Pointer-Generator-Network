A lesbian couple who found themselves seated near an anti-LGBT politician on an airplane in Russia staged a loving protest in front of him.

The pair posed for a selfie while kissing in front of Vitaly Milonov, who was seated on the row behind them on an domestic flight from Moscow to St Petersburg. 

The loving protest infuriated the St. Petersburg city councilman, who later called the women 'animals' and threatened to 'call the Cossacks' on them.

The photographer, who goes by the name Kseniya Infinity, said Milonov, famous for attacking the LGBT community, hid behind his tablet.

The kissing selfies, posted by Kseniya Infinity on her Instagram and VKontakte, has since gone viral in Russia and started to spread around the globe.

Vitaly Milonov is well-known for his discriminating anti-LGBT stance, and threatened openly gay athletes and visitors with arrest ahead of the 2014 Sochi Olympics.

After the lesbian kissing selfie went viral, Milonov confirmed the incident to a local news website and threatened to find the women and have Cossacks 'whip and torch' them. 

'This animal offended all the passengers on the plane with its extravagant, terrible, inhuman antics,' he said according to Zaks.ru, as reported by Buzzfeed.

Anger: The selfies did not please Milonov, who hid behind his tablet, and later told a local newspaper that he would  'call the Cossacks' on the two women

'I can call the Cossacks … they're already on their way, with whips and torches. We will expel all the perverts from St. Petersburg.' 

Last year he said  Apple CEO Tim Cook 'should be banned' from entering Russia after he came out as gay for the first time.

Milonov reportedly suggested that Cook could bring 'the Ebola virus, Aids or gonorrhoea',and wanted to ban him from Russia 'for life'.

In the past he has also called Stephen Fry 'a sick person', during an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, during which he also likened homosexuality to beastiality.

Speaking to a local paper, Milonov called the women's kissing 'extravagant, terrible, inhuman antics' and referred to Kseniya Infinity as 'this animal'

In December last year he staged a raid on a St Petersburg gay club where he entered the venue with riot police and arrested anyone under 18.

Following last year's Eurovision Song Contest, which he branded a 'Europe-wide gay parade', Milonov tweeted that Russia should boycott the 'Sodom show'. 

Milonov co-sponsored Russia's controversial 'gay propaganda' law bans displays of 'non-traditional sexual behaviour' in public or in front of under-18s.

The law allows the government to detain 'homosexual or sympathetic foreigners' for up to 14 days, after which they could face expulsion from the country.
