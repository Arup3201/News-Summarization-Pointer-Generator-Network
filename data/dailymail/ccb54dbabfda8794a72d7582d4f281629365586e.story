Walking just a quarter of a mile a day could save ageing adults from potential disabilities in old age

A 20-minute walk in the park every day could keep older people active and stave off disability, say researchers.

The first study of its kind shows daily walking for about a quarter of a mile may mean the difference between staying mobile or becoming housebound.

It found moderate physical activity helped ageing adults keep their ability to walk at a rate 18 per cent higher than older adults who did not exercise.

The US-based LIFE study from Yale School of Medicine, coordinated at the University of Florida, also showed regular walkers were a quarter less likely to become permanently disabled.

Researchers presented the results yesterday at the annual meeting of the American College of Sports Medicine in Orlando and it was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

They recruited 1,635 sedentary men and women ages 70 to 89 for the study.

The volunteers could walk a quarter mile within 15 minutes but were at risk of losing that ability.

The participants were randomly separated into two groups and followed for more than two years.

The first group walked 150 minutes per week and did strength, flexibility and balance training, and were regularly monitored.

The second group attended health education classes and performed stretching exercises.

Staff assessed participants every six months, checking their ability to walk, their body weight, blood pressure and pulse rate, among other measurements. They were not told who was assigned to physical activity or to the education classes.

Researchers showed that prescribed daily physical activity can prevent older adults’ loss of mobility, defined in the study as the ability to walk 400 meters, or about a quarter of a mile.

Co-principal investigator Jack Guralnik, professor of epidemiology and public health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, said the distance was an important figure for older adults.

He said: ‘Four hundred metres is once around the track, or from the parking lot to the store, or two or three blocks around your neighbourhood.

‘It’s an important distance in maintaining an independent life.’

Moderate activity helped volunteers maintain their ability to walk at a rate 18 per cent higher than older adults who did not exercise and there was a 28 per cent reduction in people permanently losing the ability to walk easily.

Prof Guralnik said ‘The fact that we had an even bigger impact on persistent disability is very good.

‘It implies that a greater percentage of the adults who had physical activity intervention recovered when they did develop mobility disability.’

Wendy Kohrt, professor of medicine in the division of geriatric medicine at the University of Colorado, who helped review the scientific merit of the study, said ‘There is a general belief among the public and the scientific and medical communities that we know exercise is good for you, so why do we need to do more research in this area?

‘However, we still do not know whether certain types or doses of exercise are better than others, particularly for specific health conditions or diseases.

‘The LIFE trial demonstrated that a modest increase in physical activity has the potential to help older adults maintain functional independence.’
