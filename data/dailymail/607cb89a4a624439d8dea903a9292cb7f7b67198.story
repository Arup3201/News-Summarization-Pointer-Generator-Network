Critic: Author and educator Camille Paglia wrote a column for Time arguing that college-age women often become victims of rape because they are naive about men's true evil nature 

Self-described 'dissident feminist' Camille Paglia has written an op-ed piece for Time Magazine arguing that female college students are naive and careless about the true nature of men as sexual predators.

Paglia, 67, a professor at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, penned the column this week in reaction to the recent abduction of University of Virginia sophomore Hannah Graham, 18, who was last seen two weeks ago in the company of a 32-year-old nursing assistant.

Jesse Matthew was captured in Texas last week and charged with abduction with intent to defile, but so far there is no sign of Graham.

In her provocative opinion piece, Paglia builds her argument on the premise that young, college-age women often become victims of sexual assault because they have a false sense of security and do not keep their guard up in public places.

Dismissing claims about an epidemic of sex assaults on campuses as 'wildly overblown,' the well-respected social critic writes that the true danger to female students is 'the ancient sex crime of abduction and murder.'

She goes so far as to say that colleges should stick to academics instead of lecturing students about sex assault, which in her mind is an exercise in futility.

Paglia essentially says that on a biological level, men are wild beasts driven by atavistic desires, and that our society has done women a great disservice by leading them to believe otherwise.

'Too many young middleclass women, raised far from the urban streets, seem to expect adult life to be an extension of their comfortable, overprotected homes,' Paglia says. 'But the world remains a wilderness. The price of women’s modern freedoms is personal responsibility for vigilance and self-defense.'

Paglia also takes a swipe at the American education system, accusing teachers and schoolbook authors of sanitizing history by removing any mention of ‘horrors and atrocities’ stemming from evil that it part and parcel of human nature.  

Case in point: The op-ed piece was written in reaction to the abduction of 18-year-old college sophomore Hannah Graham, who went missing two weeks ago in Virginia after being last seen with an older man 

In her article for the Time titled 'The Modern Campus Cannot Comprehend Evil,' Paglia argues that both the liberal and conservative worldviews are lacking a profound sense of evil because it is much easier to blame an outside force for all our troubles.

Paglia's possibly most controversial point is that critics and thinkers debating gender ideology erroneously think that the fundamental nature of man can be changed for the better, and that their violent instincts can somehow be tamed with the help of campus initiative and well-meaning speeches. 

‘But extreme sex crimes like rape-murder emanate from a primitive level that even practical psychology no longer has a language for,’ she states.

According to the renowned feminist author, an 'alienated loser' motivated by an ancient hunting reflex would prey on an unsuspecting, random woman simply to live out a sexual fantasy, or to punish the female sex for his own failures.

Paglia concludes: ‘young women do not see the animal eyes glowing at them in the dark. 

Controversial: Paglia, 67, argued that America's educators of every stripe are doing womne a disservice by making them believe that man's sexual desires can be tamed 

‘They assume that bared flesh and sexy clothes are just a fashion statement containing no messages that might be misread and twisted by a psychotic.’

Paglia is the author of the much-talked-about 1990 bestseller Sexual Personae, in which she argues that the human nature has an inherently dangerous aspect to it, especially when it comes to sexuality.

In 2005, she was named as one of the top 100 public intellectuals by the journals Foreign Policy and Prospect.
