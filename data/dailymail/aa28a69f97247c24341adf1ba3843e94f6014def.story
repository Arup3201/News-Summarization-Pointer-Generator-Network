A defendant turned away from court for wearing shorts during this week's sweltering temperatures stunned magistrates by strolling back for his hearing dressed in a blouse and skirt.

David Jeffries-Tipton, 47, was told by ushers at Cannock Magistrates Court his summer attire of shorts and a vest top were not appropriate clothing and was turned away from the building.

But disgruntled Mr Jeffries-Tipton, who was due to face magistrates for a minor criminal damage charge, reappeared at court soon after in a red floral skirt and light-coloured silk blouse.

Skirting the law: David Jeffries-Tipton donned a floral skirt and blouse in court after being told by ushers his shorts and vest top were not 'appropriate clothing'

And after returning 30 minutes later in a full set of ladies clothes from a charity shop, court staff did not bat an eye-lid at his new ensemble and his case went ahead as normal.

Mr Jeffries-Tipton had been due before magistrates on a criminal damage charge after admitting urinating on his ex-girlfriend's £48 dog basket.

Speaking after the case, in which magistrates made no reference to his cross-dressing, Jeffries-Tipton, from Stafford, said he was not happy that he could not wear shorts and his vest top.

He said: 'I am not allowed to wear shorts even though it’s one of the hottest summer days.

'There were loads of women walking around with vest tops on inside the court - so I thought I’d be OK.

'I had to go to a charity shop to get these clothes and I shall now be making a complaint.'

'When I returned I got a few funny looks but they couldn’t stop me from wearing it - and I was allowed into court.

'It’s ridiculous that it came to that in order for me to get my case heard.

A spokesperson at Cannock Crown Court said defendants must 'dress in a manner that will respect the dignity of the court.'

'The other people there thought it was quite amusing - after they found out I wasn’t a transvestite.

'Even one of the solicitors seemed to see the funny side.'

Jeffries-Tipton, from Stafford, was also charged with criminal damage to his ex-girlfriend’s flat-screen television.

He had denied damaging the television set which cost £583.80 - but admitted damaging the £48 dog basket owned by his ex, Karen Griggs, by urinating on it.

Jeffries-Tipton was acquitted of the damage to the TV as it could not be proved that the television had been damaged by the defendant as there had been no witnesses.

Chairwoman of the bench, Mrs Leonora Wilson-Weaver said his actions were of a 'disgusting nature' and had a domestic violence nature to them.

Jeffries-Tipton is to have a probation report compiled and will reappear in court on June 20.

He was released on conditional bail.

After the case a court spokesman said: 'People attending court are expected to dress in a manner that will respect the dignity of the court.

'Court staff may request that more appropriate clothing is worn.'
