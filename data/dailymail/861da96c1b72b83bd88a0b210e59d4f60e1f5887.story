It was a rare yet magnificently shocking sight, witnessed by tourists in a boat nearby one of Papua New Guinea's most active and dangerous volcanoes.

A plume of ash and smoke spewed into the air from Mount Tavurvur close to the town of Rabaul in eastern PNG.

Newly emerged footage captured the incredible moment, followed by a thundering boom which visibly shook the boat and its occupants.

Smoke and ash fills the air as Mount Tavurvur erupts near the town of Rabaul in eastern Papua New Guinea on August 29

Queensland resident Linda McNamara recently uploaded video of the eruption which was filmed on August 29, reports Ninemsn.

'Watch out for the shock, it's coming,' someone warns in the footage.

Sure enough, a few seconds later a shockwave startles everyone including a man who shouts: 'Holy smoking Toledo!'

But Ms McNamara wasn't the only one to document the volcanic explosion as others shared their extraordinary images on social media.

Pictures and satellite imagery also showed the plume reaching up to a height of about 18 kilometres, indicating a significant eruption.

The giant ash cloud over PNG forced Qantas to re-route international flights out of Sydney.

It followed an advisory issued by The Bureau of Meteorology which warned airlines the cloud was likely to spread.

Residents from Rabaul - the nearby city of the Tavurvur volcano which began erupting at 3.30am on a Friday morning - were advised to remain indoors to avoid falling ash while some communities were evacuated, Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in a statement.

The volcano, which is one of the most active in the region, destroyed the town of Rabaul in 1994 when it erupted simultaneously with nearby Mount Vulcan.
