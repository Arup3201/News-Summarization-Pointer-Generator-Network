A third year of drought in California has meant farmers have become increasinglyÂ  dependent on ground water for their crops - and now the land is sinking beneath their feet.

A USGS study found that land sinking had been measured at nearly one-foot per year in one area in the San Joaqin Valley, and that it is reducing the flow capacity of the Delta-Mendota Canal and the California Aqueduct, two key sources of water.

Increased pumping of groundwater is damaging vital water infrastructure, the U.S. Geological Survey says.

No end: Houseboats and boat docks on Digger Bay Marina in Shasta Lake City, California on 24 July 2014. Water levels show below the reddish banks which is 41 meters (135 ft) from crest and 36 per cent of capacity as California goes through its third straight year of dry weather

'We were surprised at the amount of land being affected,' Michelle Sneed, a USGS hydrologist and the report's lead author.

'We were also surprised by the rapid rate of (sinking).'

Case Vlot, a farmer who uses groundwater to keep his crops of corn and alfalfa alive says the ground at his Central Valley farm is sinking between six and eight inches a year.

Chase Hurley runs a water company nearby that sells river water to farmers who don't have groundwater to depends on.

Now, reports SF Gate, Vlot's underground wells are collapsing and the dam Hurley depends on has sunk so far that the river is threatening to spill over.

The two, along with other California farmers, are trying to brainstorm ways to curb the heavy reliance on groundwater and that resulting damage.

And farms aren't the only ones suffering from the sinking land.

Railways, roads and pipelines - things that extend over a long distance - are also under threat from an increase in the rate of ground sinking, Sneed said.

For California's bullet train project, which would speed through the Central Valley, the sinking ground is being taken into account for the system's design, Frank Vacca, the chief program manager for the California High Speed Rail Authority.

He said the rail system will be made of a flexible material that can give into movement.

'This is just one more box to check on our list of engineering considerations,' Vacca said.

Woodley said the issue has already affected construction projects on the massive San Joaquin River restoration, already projected to cost $1 billion.

The issue of sinking land in the San Joaquin Valley is not new, but had slowed in recent decades after the construction of the California Aqueduct and Delta-Mendota Canal.

But the sinking problem in the two years studied 2008-2010 was exacerbated by drought, the report found.

In those dry years, there was less rain, but also limits placed by water regulators on surface water use. This caused farmers and others to increase the amount of water pumped from underground; there are no restrictions on groundwater pumping in California.
