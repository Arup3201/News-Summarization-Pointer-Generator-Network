Jailed: Melissa Reid will appear in a TV campaign to warm about the risks of drug smuggling

Drug mule Melissa Reid is set to be the face of a national television campaign to warn young people against getting caught up in crime abroad.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is joining forces with the 21-year-old Scot’s family to highlight the risks of smuggling illegal substances, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Miss Reid’s story will be used as a cautionary tale as part of the multi-million pound nationwide campaign to be launched next month.

It will include hardhitting billboard posters, TV and cinema adverts, as well as Facebook and Twitter.

Miss Reid, from Lenzie, Dunbartonshire, was convicted of trying to smuggle £1.5 million of cocaine out of Peru in August last year with Michaella McCollum, 20, from County Tyrone.

The pair had been staying on the holiday island of Ibiza when they became involved with a drug cartel and travelled to Lima, where they were caught with the Class A drug in their suitcases.

They were jailed there in December for eight years each, reduced to six years and eight months because of their guilty pleas. 

Miss Reid is waiting to transfer to a prison in her home country. Last week Miss Reid’s father Billy said he was unable to comment on his involvement in the FCO campaign.

However the 54-year-old told The Mail on Sunday earlier this year of his plans to visit airports to speak to young travellers face-to-face, saying: ‘I have to do something – I can’t sit at home knowing vulnerable teenagers are heading to these destinations unaware they may be targeted.

‘Young people need to know there may be people out there actively looking to recruit and entrap them. When you’re on holiday your guard is down.’

According to the 2014 British Behaviour Abroad report, drug arrests involving British nationals abroad rose by six per cent to more than 700 last year. 

The FCO said: ‘The focus of the campaign is to reduce the number of drug related consular cases and raise awareness of the risks.’
