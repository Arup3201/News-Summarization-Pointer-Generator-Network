Manchester United have named more homegrown players in their 25-man squad than Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City - despite losing five British first-team players during the summer.

Louis van Gaal has included 12 homegrown stars, with the likes of Phil Jones, Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney predicted to play a major role in the Dutchman's side this season.

British players Rio Ferdinand, Danny Welbeck, Wilfried Zaha and Tom Cleverley have all moved on this summer - while Ryan Giggs decided to hang up his boots to become the club's assistant manager.

Best of British: Wayne Rooney and Darren Fletcher rose through the ranks of Everton and Manchester United respectively

Foreign talent: Midfielders Angel di Maria and Ander Herrera joined  United this summer

Van Gaal forked out more than £125million on world-class foreign quintet Angel di Maria, Radamel Falcao, Daley Blind, Ander Herrera and Marcos Rojo, however nearly half of his senior squad were educated on British shores.

Chelsea have the least amount of homegrown players over the age of 21, with just three members of their current squad having risen through a British academy - and one of those is Cesc Fabregas, who joined Arsenal at 15.

The Premier League explain on their website: 'A homegrown player will be defined as one who, irrespective of his nationality or age, has been registered with any club affiliated to the Football Association or the Football Association of Wales for a period, continuous or not, of three entire seasons or 36 months prior to his 21st birthday (or the end of the season during which he turns 21).'

All Premier League clubs must include at least eight homegrown stars - which can be supplemented with players under the age of 21 - in their respective 25-man squads in order to comply with the competition's rules.

Exception to the rule: Cesc Fabregas is classed as a homegrown player because he spent the majority of his teenage years at Arsenal

The Premier League's three promoted teams Burnley, Leicester and Queens Park Rangers have the most homegrown players with Sean Dyche's side leading the way with 19.
