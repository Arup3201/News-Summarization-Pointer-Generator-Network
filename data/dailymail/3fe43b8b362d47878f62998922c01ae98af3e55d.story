England were condemned to a Black-wash at the end of a shattering season as a searing first-half blitz from New Zealand left them in a state of disarray and there was no way back.

Julian Savea was the executioner-in-chief with a glorious hat-trick of tries, but his exploits were aided by the visitors’ failings. This was a game too far. This was the occasion when the wheels came off for an extended spell and a tour that had given such cause for long-term optimism appeared in danger of ending in humiliation. Ultimately, their fate was not as grisly as it may have been, but it was a miserable occasion nonetheless.

At half-time, England were 23 points adrift on the scoreboard. They had conceded four tries as their defence was systematically dismantled by the rampant world champions. Such was the extent of the carnage; it looked as if the tourists’ fabled collective spirit had been left utterly broken.

That notion was dispelled by a 
determined revival after half-time, but the improvement in the 
performance did not equate to enough points to turn the contest on its 
head. The All Blacks were not able to maintain their imperious 
standards, but they had already re-asserted their supremacy en route to 
claiming a 3-0 series win.

England
 will point to the close results in Auckland and Dunedin as evidence 
that they have made strides on this trip, but in truth they will fly 
home with more confusion than clarity. There is still no sign of the 
coaches being absolutely certain about their best line-up – with 
particular doubts about the midfield and wing selections.

The
 first half was arguably the worst 40-minute period of Stuart 
Lancaster’s tenure – perhaps even more abject than the second-half 
collapse in Cardiff last year. Rarely have his England team so meekly 
succumbed to an avalanche of pressure. Even when they were pounded by 
the Springboks in Johannesburg two years ago, the brutal mis-match 
didn’t last so long. Four tries before the break wasn’t even a 
sufficient illustration of New Zealand’s utter dominance.

Savea
 is becoming the man focal point for English nightmares with his scoring
 feats in this fixture. The All Black wing had touched down five times 
in three previous matches against Lancaster’s side and he continued his 
solo onslaught within four minutes here.

From
 a lineout on the right, the hosts sent the ball in-field at pace to 
Cruden, who passed on to Ben Smith – the hero of the victory in Dunedin 
last weekend. The full back twisted past an isolated Chris Ashton and 
released Savea, who charged over in the corner.

A
 Freddie Burns penalty reduced the arrears, but it was fleeting respite.
 New Zealand’s second try was a near-replica of the first, as they 
circumvented the visitors’ narrow defence with alarming ease. Again it 
came from a lineout on their right flank and when Cruden received the 
ball from Richie McCaw he burst between Kyle Eastmond and Manu Tuilagi 
to go clear in midfield.

His
 long pass fell in front of Savea but, despite the wet conditions, he 
picked it up on the bounce and carved inside to score. That act of 
individual brilliance was another stark indication of the continued gap 
between these nations – these are the moments of ball-playing Kiwi 
quality which their English rivals are simply unable to match at 
present.

Astonishingly, 
Savea should have had a hat-trick within 14 minutes when he took a pass 
on the overlap to cross the line again, but the ball had travelled 
forward. It was a fortunate let-off for England as the chance should 
have been taken, but there were plenty more such openings to come.

After
 a penalty by Cruden, Billy Vunipola was sin-binned – somewhat dubiously
 – for a high tackle on the home No 10 and the All Blacks made hay 
against their depleted opponents. Dane Coles went close on the left, 
then Malakai Fekitoa’s midfield break created mayhem, Cory Jane swerved 
around Marland Yarde on the right and sent Aaron Smith in from close 
range.

The fourth Kiwi try 
came five minutes before the break as Ma’a Nonu fed the ball to Ben 
Smith and he left Burns and Yarde trailing in his wake before 
off-loading for Aaron Smith to score his second try. Cruden’s conversion
 made it 29-6 – and game, set and match – at half-time.

When
 England re-emerged for the second half, there was a change in 
personnel, with Luther Burrell on for Eastmond, and a change in 
intensity levels too. The interval had evidently led to the dishing out 
of a few home truths and the tourists suddenly dredged up the will for 
the fight.

In the 43rd 
minute, the wounded defiance led to a try. Joe Launchbury rampaged into 
space in midfield and from his off-load, Ben Youngs scorched away before
 passing on to Tuilagi. The Leicester centre drove strongly towards the 
line, despite three defenders attempting to bring him down and from the 
ruck, Yarde darted over to score for the second successive week. The 
wing so nearly struck again two minutes later, when he exploded through 
from the back of a lineout, but he was well held up over the line by 
Jane.

England’s spirited 
rally stalled and they were forced to absorb a sustained period of New 
Zealand pressure, but they did so with far greater conviction than in 
the disastrous first half. When they re-emerged into enemy territory, 
Yarde was once again the primary threat as his arcing run took him past 
Nonu and into the home 22, before Burrell knocked on to squander a 
scoring position.

The 
visitors continued to strive for a grandstand finish, but there was one 
more indignity to come. The clock had reached 80 minutes when one last 
All Black assault saw Jane audaciously off-load from the right to send 
Savea clear to gleefully notch his third try of the night. It was 
fitting that he was the one to have the last word.
