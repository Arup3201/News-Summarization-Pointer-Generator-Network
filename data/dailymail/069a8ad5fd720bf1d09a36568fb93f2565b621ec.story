Tottenham welcome Arsenal to White Hart Lane on Saturday and both teams have already got the competitive juices flowing with derby 'throwbacks' being posted on their youtube accounts.

The in-form teams go head-to-head in the north London derby with only two points separating the sides.

Sportsmail looks at these 'throwbacks' and discusses some of the best goals.

 

Tottenham

Jermain Defoe v Arsenal (November 2004) - White Hart Lane

The Sunderland striker scored a memorable individual goal when the home side were 3-1 down, as he glided past Cesc Fabregas and Patrick Vieira and curled a shot past the helpless Jens Lehmann and into the to corner.

Danny Rose v Arsenal (April 2007) - White Hart Lane

The left back had a debut he would never forget after scoring thunderous 30-yard volley. Gunners keeper Manuel Almunia cleared the ball from a corner and Rose hit it first time - giving Almunia or his defence no chance of stopping it.

Gareth Bale v Arsenal (November 2010) - Emirates Stadium

The Real Madrid star burst through from a devastating counter-attack involving Defoe and Rafael van der Vaart before slotting home past Lukas Fabianski and helping Tottenham fight back from 2-0 down to come away with all three points from the Emirates.

Kyle Walker v Arsenal (October 2011) - White Hart Lane

Walker scored a spectacular winner at White Hart Lane back in 2011, when he picked up a loose ball from Luka Modric's blocked shot and his swerving drive deceiving the helpless Wojciech Szczesny. 

England international Kyle Walker has since scored a number of long range efforts for Tottenham

 

 

Arsenal

Thierry Henry v Tottenham (November 2002) - Highbury

The Arsenal legend scored arguably the greatest ever goal in the north London derby when he picked the ball up in his own half, beat three Spurs defenders and slotted the ball into the bottom corner to give the home side the lead.

Theo Walcott v Tottenham (November 2012) - Emirates Stadium 

Arsenal fought from 2-0 down to beat Spurs 5-2 and winger Theo Walcott sealed the victory after controlling an Alex Song through ball and slotting home past the helpless Hugo Lloris.

Tomas Rosicky v Tottenham (March 2014) - White Hart Lane

The Czech midfielder scored the only goal in a tense affair but it was one he is unlikely to ever forget, after arrowing a shot from the corner of the box into the top corner, following a swift counter attack.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain v Tottenham (September 2014) 

The England international scored a late equaliser at the Emirates Stadium to hand Arsenal a deserved draw. The winger smashed home from close range after the ball fell to him from a goalmouth scramble.
