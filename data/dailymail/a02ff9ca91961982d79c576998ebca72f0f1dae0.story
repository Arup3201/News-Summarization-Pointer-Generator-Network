A 36-year-old woman who had sex with a 12-year old-boy has been jailed for 10 years.

Joy Leaann McCall, from Ocala, Florida, had sex three times with the young boy who was the same age as her own children.

She was given 10 years in prison for each charge of lewd or lascivious battery on a child between 12 and 15 but told the sentence would run concurrently.

McCall pleaded guilty to the second degree felony charges and was given a 134 day credit for time already spent in jail.

The court heard that the 12-year-old, who has not been named, told police that he received Facebook messages from the woman.

He said the messages 'continued to get more heated' and he later received photos of her posing in underwear.

McCall arranged to meet the boy at a local shopping mall where she picked him up and ended up having sex in the back seat of her car.

The boy claimed he contacted her again five days later.

She collected him and drove him to some woods, where they had sex again.

He claimed they met for a third time on February 16th and had sex in the same wooded area.

McCall, a shop worker, later admitted to police she had sex with the boy.

The affair leaked out after the young boy confided in a friend who told the victim's mother, according to the Ocala Star Banner.

Police were called after the boy's mom read some of the text messages sent by McCall to her son.

'She was able to see through the different text messaging that had occurred between McCall and the juvenile. And determine the dates that the incidents had occurred,' Sergeant Angy Scroble told WCJB back in February.
