They appear more at home in the world of Jeeves and Wooster.

But the butler is back in modern Britain - and now it's been revealed they can earn up to £300,000 for attending to their charges.

Being able to juggle wardrobe management and silver service while running a house has proved to be a lucrative career for those willing to serve the super-wealthy.

In demand: Former royal butlers with the right pedigree and long service can command up to £100,000 a year in the private sector

Elegant: Downton Abbey's Mr Carson, pictured with Mrs Hughes, embodies old-fashioned British elegance

According to the International Guild of Professional Butlers, around 10,000 professional heads of household are working in the UK today, The Times reported.

A number of agencies and butler training centres has boomed, meaning that Britain is exporting butlers like never before.

And it would appear that this breed of butler is not unlike Downton's serious Mr Carson, who serves as the Crawley family's butler in the award-winning period drama.

Loyal service: A common stipulation among the super-rich is that the butler should be British

They earn, on average, between £60,000 and £150,000 a year, although some can command £300,000 or more.

And it is particularly British butlers who are the most in demand, according to the The British Butler Academy.

A common stipulation among the international super-rich is that the butler should be British, or have learnt the British way of serving.

And while they may take home a pretty pay packet, the duties of a butler are varied and complex - so a butler can be expected to work around the clock to serve his client.

A butler will be trained in the arts of silver service, etiquette and even British Accent training.

There is also laundry and wardrobe management, VIP service, yacht interior crew elite training and cabin crew service skills that must be mastered.

Former royal butlers with the right pedigree and long service can command up to £100,000 a year in the private sector.

The word 'butler' comes from Anglo-Norman buteler, a version of the Old French botellier 'officer in charge of the king's wine bottles', derived of boteille 'bottle', Modern French bouteille, itself from Gallo-Romance buticula 'bottle'.

The role of the butler, for centuries, has been that of the chief steward of a household, the attendant entrusted with the care and serving of wine and other bottled beverages which in ancient times might have represented a considerable portion of the household's assets.
