Stuart Broad will play in the final Test against India at The Oval — despite this shocking image revealing the damage caused by breaking his nose in the last game.

Broad is set to wear facial protection as he looks to help England seal a series they lead 2-1. Captain Alastair Cook said: ‘We think he’s going to be absolutely fine. He batted and bowled his six or seven overs in practice and didn’t get any pain from it.’

Broad top-edged a delivery through the gap between his helmet and grille last week.

The fast bowler tweeted earlier this week: 'Just browsing 
the web for a mask to wear at the Oval. Couple of early favourites....' 
with pictures of Batman and supervillain Bane. A follower later posted 
the suggestion of a Hannibal Lecter mask.

Broad will follow the example of footballers such as Paul Gascoigne and wear a protective face mask to ensure that he can play in the final Test at The Oval.

The nasty blow Broad took when he top-edged a bouncer from Varun Aaron into the gap between the peak of his helmet and grille during England’s thumping fourth Test win looked to have ruled him out.

But he emerged from a Manchester hospital and ruled out reconstructive surgery before insisting he will be fit to play, complete with a mask, on Friday.  

‘It was a big impact but if there’s no risk we will play him, no doubt about that,’ said England coach Peter Moores. ‘It is a big game at The Oval and we want him there. If that means playing with a football face mask so be it. He will have panda eyes. He will look lovely.’
