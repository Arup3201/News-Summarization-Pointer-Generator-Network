Stress-free Christmas: Justine Pattinson recommends making the most of your freezer

If you're feeling stressed about the thought of cooking Christmas dinner for the family on Wednesday than fear not. Food writer Justine Pattison can help you get a head start with her time-saving tips.

Justine, author of recipe book Freeze, told MailOnline that with a little bit of forward planning, you can freeze your way to Christmas - so you can then relax and enjoy the day.

From roast potatoes to stuffing and desserts, here she explains how you can prepare then freeze food for minimal fuss on Christmas Day...

Cranberry sauce and bread sauce freeze beautifully for at least three months and can be thawed in the fridge overnight or reheated very gently from frozen, adding a little milk to the bread sauce if needed. Flat-freeze them both in zip-seal bags and you'll save heaps of space in the freezer.

If you are worried that your Christmas bird won't give enough juice for a decent gravy, make a rich home-made stock with fresh chicken wings, onion, carrot, bay and thyme. Add a couple of rashers of smoked bacon, 3 tbsp redcurrant jelly and a glass of wine or port. Cover with cold water then simmer very gently for 45 minutes. After straining, pour into a rigid container and freeze for up to six months. Use as a base on the day and you’ll have a rich tasting gravy in no time.

A slightly stale loaf can be whizzed into crumbs and made into a fabulous home-made stuffing. I add pork sausage meat – or squeeze the sausage meat out of my favourite herby sausages - sautéed  onions and leeks, ready-to-eat dried apricots, fresh cranberries and flaked almonds to mine.

Freeze in a small roasting tin lined with foil then, once solid, take out of the tin, wrap in a second layer of foil and freeze for up to three months. Return to the tin and bake, uncovered, from frozen or thawed until nicely browned and piping hot throughout. Pigs in blankets can also be frozen ahead of time and cooked on the day.

Roast potatoes can be frozen for up to three months while doing a large batch of braised red cabbage and freezing it means you'll have enough for the whole of the festive season

Forget the bought kind. Homemade roasties taste so much better. Peel, cut into large chunks and par-boil in a large pan of water for four minutes. Drain well in a colander, then return to the pan and add around 5 tbsp sunflower oil or melted goose fat, flaked sea salt and lots of ground black pepper.

Shake about a bit to roughen up the edges then tip onto a large baking tray and leave to cool.

Open-freeze (without covering) until solid. Transfer to a large freezer bag, press out as much air as possible, seal and freeze for up to three months. Roast from frozen in a hot oven for 50-60 minutes.

You can do the same thing with parsnips or carrots too. And if you prefer mash to roast potatoes, you can freeze in bags and thaw overnight before reheating on the hob or in the microwave.

Freezer essentials: Justine recommends always keeping milk, bread and butter on ice for emergencies

Braised red cabbage freezes very well, so make a large batch and it will see you through the whole of the festive season and beyond. I like to add star anise, a cinnamon stick and chunks of apple to mine - don't use cooking apples though or they'll turn to mush. Flat-freeze in zip-seal bags and thaw for three to four hours at room temperature before reheating.

Frozen brussels sprouts can be heated from frozen in a large pan with lightly fried pancetta and chestnuts. I use the frozen diced pancetta and vacuum-packed chestnuts, which I break into pieces with my fingers as I drop them into the pan. A sprinkle of sea salt, a grind of black pepper and a knob of butter is all that’s needed to season and glaze at the end.

Make an alternative to Christmas pudding, such as my Tutti-frutti ice cream pudding or try a chocolate torte or meringue pavlova. Whipped cream freezes quite well but you're better off keeping pouring creams in the fridge. Stash a box or two of mince pies, some brandy butter and good vanilla ice cream in the freezer and you'll never be short of a festive pud.

Keep a couple of pints of milk in cartons, butter and a small loaf of bread to hand in the freezer. They all freeze well and can prevent a last minute panic. Cheese, bacon and sliced ham can be frozen for a month or two without spoiling and don't take up too much space either. Unbaked French pastries make a handy breakfast when you have family or friends staying and taste fantastic cooked from frozen and served hot from the oven.
