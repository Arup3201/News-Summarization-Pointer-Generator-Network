Emotional plea: Kathleen Ferrier from Circular San Diego, a nonprofit working to stop traffic fatalities, spent 30 seconds trying to compose herself while speaking about Junniper Avang

Tragic: The seven-month-old girl was killed when an SUV hit her while she was in her stroller crossing the road with her father in San Diego earlier this month

Junniper did not survive the crash and her father is still in a critical condition in hospital.  

Given two minutes to make her case to the meeting, Ferrier said: 'I'm having trouble this morning. (I have a) 9- and an 11-year-old and this really hits home.'

She finished by saying: 'Please prioritize street improvements throughout our city where people are dying time and time again.'

According to ABC 10 a friend of the Avang family Marisa Smith, also spoke.

She said: 'Action better be taken because there are so many families in that area right now who now fear for their children's lives.' 

Councilwoman Lorie Zapf said they are making street safety a top priority and handing the information to the traffic engineering division. 

She said: 'Action better be taken because there are so many families in that area right now who now fear for their children's lives.' 

Family and residents near where the youngster was hit have proposed to close off the section of the road and turn it into a memorial park.  

Scene: The remains of the stroller Junniper was being pushed in when she was struck
