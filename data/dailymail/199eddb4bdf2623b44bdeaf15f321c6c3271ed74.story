Rounding off the top five was Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind from 1977, and the Alien sequel, Aliens from 1986.

Contributors included scientist Sir Robert Winston, Nobel prize winner Sir Paul Nurse, and The Sky at Night presenter Maggie Aderin Pocock and epidemiologist Dr Suzanne Gage.

It also featured directors such as Guillermo Del Toro, Edgar Wright, Roland Emmerich and Alfonso Cuaron - whose 2013 Oscar-winning film Gravity came in at number 59.

The 1970s and 1980s stood out as the golden age of sci-fi, with 43 films in the top 100, and eight in the top ten from these decades.

Small budget films also performed better than blockbusters, with Moon, in 14th and the original Solaris in 17th ranking higher than Avatar in 77th place and Pacific Rim in 82nd.
