Lynne Hansen, 58, did not sleep well last night. 

She was disturbed by the deadly crash that yesterday claimed the life of Aneri Patel, 16, at the exact same spot where her daughter, Emma, 20, was killed by a car seven years ago.

The similarities were 'eerie'. Both young women were hit by inexperienced drivers near the bus stop on the corner of Railway Parade in Kogarah, in Sydney's south, around the same time of the morning.  

Mrs Hansen's first reaction to Monday's horrible news was to feel sorrow for Ms Patel's mother and father.

'(I was thinking about) the poor parents, really, because we're the ones that live with it,' Mrs Hansen told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday. 

'The other drivers, they go home eventually, they grow up,' she said. But for the parents, 'it's horrible, you never get over it.'

Tragedy: In March 2007 pedestrian Emma Hanson, 20, was struck by a car at the exact same intersection where Aneri Patel, 16 was killed on Monday

CCTV footage showed the moment Emma and other bystanders were struck.

Learner driver Rose Deng was behind the wheel of this red Toyota Echo which ploughed into pedestrians in Kogarah in March 2007. 

Aneri Patel, a 16-year-old student at Kogarah High School, was killed when she was struck by a 4WD driven by an unlicensed 26-year-old driver on Monday morning. 

Police arrested Puipuimaota Galuvao, 26, who was driving the car that struck and killed Ms Patel. It's believed the car mounted a footpath and hit the student outside a Kogarah chemist on Monday morning.

Galuvao is the sister of former NRL star Joe Galuvao, a two-time premiership winner for Many Sea Eagles and Penrith Panthers. She has been charged with a number of driving offences including dangerous driving occasioning death and driving without a licence. She has been granted bail and will appear in Kogarah Local Court on October 14.

Friends gather where Aneri Patel was killed yesterday, singing songs and lighting candles. 

The crash site in Kogarah yesterday. 

The scene in Kogarah on Monday. Two others were severely injured by the crash.

An unlicensed driver was behind the wheel of the 4WD that killed the Kogarah High student and severely injured two others, a 51-year-old woman and an 84-year-old man, about 11:30am yesterday. 

The driver, a 26-year-old woman, was granted bail.

According to Nine News, the sister of former NRL star Joe Galuvao was charged over the crash.

Ms Hansen was killed in March 2007 when learner driver Rose Deng accidentally drove a red Toyota Echo into a waiting bus queue.

No changes have been made to the intersection since the incident. The speed limit on Railway Parade was reduced from 60km/h to 50km/h. 

Kogarah mayor Stephen Agius told Daily Mail Australia that NSW police, Roads and Maritimes Services, police and council agreed  'no feasible engineering solutions would have prevented that (2007) crash occuring'. 

Mrs Hansen, whose family is from Orange, said bollards should be installed as a safety measure at the 'very tricky' intersection where both Emma and Aneri were hit.

'It is a tricky intersection. I think anyone who has driven there would agree with me,' Mrs Hansen said. 'You've really got to stop and think at that intersection.' 

She said inexperienced drivers would 'definitely' struggle with the intersection. 

Mum Lynne Hansen said the similarities between the crashes were 'eerie'.

Kogarah Chamber of Commerce president Megan Barker told Daily Mail Australia bollards should be put up to protect pedestrians.

'We definitely need some bollards there to protect pedestrians,' she said. 'We just need those lights looked at and the bus stop... moved down the road. 

'It's right on the bend. It's in a bit of a bad spot, there, actually.' 

Mr Agius said Kogarah Council will act immediately should police and RMS investigations into Monday's accident make any recommendations.  

The driver who allegedly struck Ms Patel with a 4WD will face offences including dangerous driving occasioning death, negligent driving occasioning death, and driving a vehicle on the road without a licence.

She will face Kogarah Local Court on October 14.

Mrs Hansen said Emma was 'the most gorgeous girl, inside and out' who was loved by all'. She had been studying fashion design at Kogarah TAFE around the time of her death.

Mrs Hansen said she had forgiven the driver, Ms Deng, for the accident which killed her daughter. But she still thinks about Emma everyday.  

'I just feel so sorry for the (Aneri's) parents because you never get over it,' Mrs Hansen said.

'Really, you just look at what your child was like.. and how much you're going to miss your child and love them. 

Emma Hansen was a studying to become telephone counsellor to help people in need. Lifeline's Sutherland office set up a scholarship fund in her name - the Emma Hansen Memorial Fund - for people who want to study Telephone Counselling but cannot afford it.
