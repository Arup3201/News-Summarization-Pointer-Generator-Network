If at first you don't succeed; try, try again.

That's the lesson Timo the Ragdoll cat has been teaching thousands of online fans after spending months of training to be able to get into his hammock.

The cat clearly had initial difficulties getting into the hammock when his owners first brought it home.

A series of videos posted online show him falling out of the hammock and even trying a running jump in a desperate attempt to get into it.

But after four months of trying, Timo is now finally able to sit back and relax in his favourite resting place.

The latest video, posted on to YouTube, shows the cat lying back in the hammock quite contentedly, seemingly without a care in the world.
