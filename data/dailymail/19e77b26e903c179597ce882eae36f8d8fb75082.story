As he proudly places his oil painting on a small easel at his parents' home, ten-year-old Felix Chadwick-Histed still can't believe he will soon be looking at his work on the walls of the Royal Academy of Arts.

The schoolboy is set to become the youngest ever exhibitor in the 244-year history of the Royal Academy of Arts, when his creation entitled Trees goes on display at the summer exhibition.

'I thought that I was dreaming and the next day there would be a letter saying sorry, we got it wrong,' he said.

Young talent: Ten-year-old Felix Chadwick-Histed's oil painting entitled Trees will be on display this summer - he will become the youngest ever exhibitor in the 244-year history of the Royal Academy of Arts

The talented youngster, from Teddington, Surrey, said he could not wait to see his work at the world’s largest open submission contemporary art show.

Felix has enjoyed drawing and painting since he was very young and attends after-school workshops.

He enjoys doing still life and wildlife pictures and said he hoped to be an architect.

Felix's parents could not believe it when the prestigious Royal Academy of Arts took a particular liking to one of his pictures and decided to hang it at this year’s exhibition.

Labour of love: Felix has enjoyed drawing and painting since he was very young and attends after-school workshops. He enjoys doing still life and wildlife pictures and said he hoped to be an architect

His
father Chris Histed, a publisher, said: 'His painting is his vision 
looking at trees in Hampton. He painted it about six to eight weeks ago.

He said Felix's attendance at after-school clubs 'has massively nurtured his art making.'

'He
has literally got the Royal Academy of Arts, saying ‘That’s all right’,
and now he is in the exhibition. It’s extraordinary.'

He has always enjoyed painting trees in his garden or at the park.

Prestigious honour: Both emerging and established artists from around the world entered more than 11,000 works this year, but the academy picked only 1,200 entrants to display

More than 150,000 visitors are expected to see the exhibition between June and August.

Both emerging and established artists from around the world entered more than 11,000 works this year, but the academy picked only 1,200 entrants to display.

A spokeswoman for the Royal Academy of Arts, based in Piccadilly, said: 'The summer exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts has been running for 244 years so we are unable to check all our archives, but we are happy to say that Felix is certainly one of the youngest exhibitors ever.'

The BBC, which will cover the exhibition, aired a special Culture Show programme on the event last year.

Last November Kieron Williamson, nine, earned an impressive £106,260 for his paintings.

The boy known as Mini Monet beamed as buyers from around the world queued to be first in line when his watercolours, pastels and oils went on sale at a Norfolk gallery.
