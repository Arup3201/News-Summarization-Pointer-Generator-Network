Cats have nine lives, so the old adage goes.

Which perhaps explains how this adorable kitten managed to find safety under the axle of a Range Rover - despite dodging through rush-hour traffic on a busy dual carriage way.

The black cat was found shoehorned into the narrow space above the vehicle's wheel arch after dicing with death on the A40 near Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire.

This black kitten, now nicknamed Axle, caused a ten-minute standstill on a busy A-road after having to be rescued from under the axle of a Range Rover

The adorable cat, pictured left and right, had climbed into the narrow space after dodging across the A40 in rush-hour traffic this morning

Motorists watched in amazement as the cat - now dubbed 'Axle' - darted across four lines of road, weaving in and out of the traffic, at 9am today. 

The young cat was found cowering in the narrow space - and prompted a ten-minute delay as police launched a rescue. The cat  is now looking for a new home.

A spokesman for the Central Motorway Police Group (CMPG) said: 'At 9am the kitten ran onto the busy dual carriageway of the A40 near the Ross services and hid underneath a Range Rover where he had to be rescued by officers from West Mercia Police and CMPG.

'They've dubbed him Axle given that he was found hiding in the rear differential.

'It ran across the dual track at about 9am bringing traffic to a halt before hiding in another vehicle.

'The road was blocked for about 10 minutes whilst officers, including PC Karl Lacey, rescued the kitten from underneath the Range Rover.'

Pc Lacey, of CMPG, said: 'It is possible the cat had crawled into another car which had then pulled onto the garage forecourt at the services.

'It was then seen running across the forecourt onto the dual carriageway where it hid under the axle of the Range Rover which had stopped in traffic.'

Motorist Alan Redding, 23, was driving to work when he saw the kitten come within inches of being mown down.

He said: 'I saw a flash of black and realised it was a tiny kitten darting between the cars. It is a miracle it wasn't flattened.

'Thankfully, it had a happy ending but no doubt used up a bulk of its nine lives.

'Luckily the car it hid under wasn't moving otherwise it could have been a different story.'

The kitten was taken to nearby Chaseview Vets while attempts were being made to find its owners.
