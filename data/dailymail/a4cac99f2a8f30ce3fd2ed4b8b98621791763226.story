The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has announced a multimillion-pound contract to buy 51 new light patrol vehicles for soldiers in Afghanistan.

Defence Minister Philip Dunne announced the £46 million deal for the extra Foxhound vehicles during a visit to the British company that makes them.

The Foxhound replaced the Army’s Snatch Land Rover, which proved highly vulnerable to roadside bombs used by insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Kitted out: The Foxhound Light Protected Patrol Vehicle offers more protection to passengers from roadside bombs

It has enhancements including a V-shaped hull to give protection against the bombs which have been a common tactic of Taliban fighters in Afghanistan.

The Army’s most agile protected vehicle, it uses cutting-edge Formula 1 technology to provide unparalleled protection for its weight and class.

It can reach speeds of up to 80mph and drive away from an improvised explosive device (IED) strike on just three wheels, while its engine is so advanced it can be changed in 30 minutes and put back on the road.

Costly: The MoD has announced that it is spending £46 million on 51 new Foxhound vehicles

Ready to go: Defence Minister Philip Dunne said it has taken 40 months from the design stage ton get the vehicles ready for deployment in Afghanistan

The first Foxhounds were deployed to 
Afghanistan earlier this year and are now being used by soldiers who are
mentoring and partnering with the Afghan National Security Forces.

Mr Dunne announced details of the new contract during a visit to General Dynamics Land Systems: Force Protection Europe’s spares facility in Telford, which provides spares for the Foxhound vehicle.

During the visit, Mr Dunne and Major 
Chris Thoms, requirements manager for protected mobility at the MoD, met
with staff who are also providing logistical support to the army in 
Afghanistan.

Mr Dunne, 
Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology, said: 'I was 
pleased to meet with employees at General Dynamics: Force Protection who
have helped make Foxhound a real procurement success story, taking only
40 months to develop it from the initial design to deployment in 
Afghanistan.

'The work being done by staff here in Telford is ensuring the vehicles can stay on the road and helping our soldiers do the vital job of engaging with Afghan forces and protecting the local population.

'Balancing the MoD’s budget means we can now confidently invest in equipment like Foxhound, which has the flexibility and adaptability to operate in a wide variety of environments, providing capability for the Army well into the future.

'This investment shows the MoD playing its part in delivering growth and sustaining jobs in the West Midlands industrial base.'

The contract is part of an overall investment of £340 million by the MoD in Foxhound since 2010, and the 51 extra vehicles take the Army’s total fleet to 376 vehicles.

The contract is also expected to sustain jobs at the company’s Telford facility, its headquarters in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, and throughout the UK in its supply chain.

Speaking in September when Foxhound was first operational in Afghanistan, chief of staff for the Bastion Force Protection Wing Squadron Leader Jim Stewart said: 'Foxhound is an enormous leap forward in capability.

'The off-road mobility, enhanced protection and night-vision systems that it offers to the troops on the ground are unmatched in a vehicle of this size.'

In action: The first Foxhounds have already been deployed in Afghanistan

Advanced: The vehicles can get away from roadside bombs on three wheels and its engine can be replaced in just half an hour
