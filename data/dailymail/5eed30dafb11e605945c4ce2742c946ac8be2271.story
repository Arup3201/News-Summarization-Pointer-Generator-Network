A thief who stole a collection of military medals awarded to a medic in the First World War and then sold them to a pawnbroker for just £25 walked free from court yesterday.

Gary Williams told the court his behaviour was the result of his own sense of 'loss' following two bereavements.

The 49-year-old said the death of his father and brother in 2013 had clouded his judgement and left him feeling depressed. 

Williams was handed a 12-month sentence, suspended for 18 months, and was ordered to carry out 100 hours unpaid work.

The medic, Thomas Henry Lord's granddaughter, Jean Sanderson, 66, last night condemned the lenient sentence and Williams' justification for committing the crime.

The retired night care assistant said: 'I have had bereavements in my family, I've had a horrible year, these things happen but it doesn't turn me into a criminal.

'It makes me so angry that people get a clever lawyer in order to wriggle get out of things. In Tudor times they would have been hung for less and my grandfather would have been disgusted at the kid gloves treatment this man got.'

She said her grandfather had volunteered to fight in the war, but because of his age he had to join the ambulance service. 

Mrs Sanderson said: 'He must have seen a lot and it must have affected him.

'What loss Williams has suffered does not even compare to the suffering my grandfather saw during the war. What that man did to us was damn right cruel. I feel violated that he had been rummaging about especially after I'd trusted him to do work on my house.'

The court was told the military medals had been awarded to Mr Lord for serving in the Middle East.

Joining up as the war in 1914, Mr Lord helped tend to the wounded on the battlefields and recover the bodies of the dead.

He served as a medic in the horrific Mesopotamian campaign against the Ottoman Empire and in Alexandria in Egypt.

Mr Lord died in 1940 and his solid-silver medals - a 1914/15 Star, British War Medal and Allied Victory Medal – eventually ended up with Mrs Sanderson.

But Williams, a builder, spotted the medals through a bedroom window as he was fixing her roof in Burnley. He then stole them after he asked to use the toilet.

Williams sold them to a pawnbroker for £25 and they were subsequently sold on for £50. They were returned when the pawnbroker read a public appeal about the theft and tipped off police.

Philip Holden, mitigating, said: 'The offence was out of character. Mr Williams has experienced life events that have affected his ability to think clearly. The loss of his father and brother impacted on him. The bereavements took place at the end of 2013 some months before the commission of these offences.

Passing sentence, Recorder Michael Blakey told him: 'I accept this was impulsive. This clearly crosses the custodial threshold - but for reasons outlined it needn't be an immediate custodial sentence.

'You have had bereavements during your life but people in similar circumstances do not resort to what you did. Ordinarily I would have no hesitation sending you to prison.

'But I am mindful of your early guilty plea, this offence is out of character, clinically you have a depressive illness and are receiving counselling, you have lost your reasonably good character. As a consequence your life has changed, you are on benefits. A great deal of these are punishments in themselves.' 

Mrs Sanderson, a grandmother-of-three, said: 'People like him are the lowest of the low and thanks to him, I don't trust anyone to come to my house anymore - and that's not fair on the honest people.

'It's sad that we live in this sort of world. I'm sure my grandfather would have never have suspected this sort of callous betrayal back home when he was serving his country.'
