Sales of Ebola 'survival packs' are soaring amid fears the pandemic will soon spread further around the world. 

Some of the packs on sale online include everything from boiler suits and face masks to hand santisers and information books.

Scores of companies and sellers are now advertising the kits for sale - with some products being offered for as little as £2.99.

'Recommended': A spokesman for the firm selling the masks said they had sold 'hundreds' since the outbreak

Products for sale include a £37.50 'liquid-tight coverall' and a £2 book on how to survive the outbreak

The spending spree has been fuelled by fears the virus could soon come to the UK. Above, staff at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle, take part in a drill to practise treating suspected ebola cases

Face masks are among the many products people are  buying in a bid to protect themselves from the virus

One of the packs, including a 'Honeywell liquid tight safety coverall with integrated gloves', is being sold for £37.50 on Amazon.co.uk in medium, large and extra-large.

Another 'personal protection kit' is advertised for £9 on eBay as being able to defend against Ebola.

It includes a hooded coverall, face masks, gloves, a hair net, heavy duty PVC shoe covers, protective glasses, disinfectant wipes and a clinical waste bag.

Amazon users can also buy a pack of 10 face masks 'recommended' by the World Health Organisation for 'protection against Ebola'.

The £2.99 product is being sold by a Rochdale-based seller named Nightingale Nursing Supplies.

A spokesman for the firm said: 'We have sold hundreds since the Ebola outbreak, they are selling quite well, sales are increasing.' 

British firms have reported a surge in demand after a similar products, like the ones above, were sold in the US

But others are trying to cash on the outbreak with sick T-shirts making fun of the killer virus

The spokesman added: 'They are going out to people across the country, some nurses, but mainly members of the public.' 

Other masks sold on the two websites include one which comes with a visor and another described as a gas mask costing £149.90.

A book by author Steven King called Ebola Survival Guide 2015: 10 Things You Must Know To Survive The Coming Ebola Outbreak!, is also being offered on Amazon as a Kindle download.

The Ebola outbreak is thought to have started in Guinea in December last year. Deaths from the virus then rose rapidly in West Africa this summer and now top 4,000.

World Health Organisation director-general Margaret Chan said the Ebola outbreak has proved 'the world is ill-prepared to respond to any severe, sustained, and threatening public health emergency'. 

In a statement to a regional health conference in the Philippines, she said: 'I have never seen a health event threaten the very survival of societies and governments in already very poor countries.' 

Hand sanitisers and disinfectant sprays citing Ebola in the product descriptions are also on sale.

But other suppliers are selling sick products which mock the disease, which has already claimed 4,000 lives.

They include a T-shirt which reads 'Ask me about Ebola' but can then be pulled over the person's head to reveal an image of a gas mask.

Another sick t-shirt states 'keep calm it's only Ebola' and a car sticker featuring a 'hazardous' sign with the words 'Ebola is coming' printed on it is also on sale.

News of the boom in sales comes after London mayor Boris Johnson said he fears the disease will soon move to Britain, with the capital the first city hit.

The World Health Organization today called the Ebola outbreak 'the most severe, acute health emergency seen in modern times'.

It added that economic disruption can be curbed if people are educated so they don't make any irrational moves to dodge infection.

WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, citing World Bank figures, said 90 per cent of economic costs of any outbreak 'come from irrational and disorganised efforts of the public to avoid infection.'

'We are seeing, right now, how this virus can disrupt economies and societies around the world,' she said, but added that adequately educating the public was a 'good defense strategy' and would allow governments to prevent economic disruptions.
