If you are scared of spiders, it might be an idea to go on a long holiday abroad.

For the mild spring and long, warm summer has created a perfect storm for arachnids to thrive.

The scuttling insects are at their most prevalent at the moment during the key mating season.

A Red Kneed Spider. This one lives at London Zoo. Zoologist Tim Cockerill says 'This is the time of year when the males mature and start wandering about looking for a mate'

Zoologist Tim Cockerill, who presents BBC Four documentary Spider House next Wednesday, said: ‘Lots of fruit on the trees meant lots of flying insects, which in turn has meant lots of spiders.’

He told the Radio Times: ‘This is the time of year when the males mature and start wandering about looking for a mate. So if you see them scurrying around, that’s what’s on their mind.’

This false black widow spider, steatoda grossa, was found in Hampshire, England

Dr Cockerill insists there is no need to fear the insects.

‘Is it something deep within our evolutionary consciousness that we’ve inherited, or is it just something that we’ve learned from our parents? Personally, I don’t understand it.

‘There is no reason why we should be afraid. They’re things of great fascination and ingenuity. They just make you gasp with amazement.’

Is arachnophobia inherited from our parents or in evolutionary consciousness asks Dr Cockerill
