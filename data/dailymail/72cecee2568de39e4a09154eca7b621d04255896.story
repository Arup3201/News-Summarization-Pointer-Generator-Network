Gary Neville has backed Saido Berahino to break into Roy Hodgson's England squad.

The West Brom striker struck his seventh goal of the season in Monday night's 2-2 draw with Manchester United.

Berahino missed out on a call-up for last month's Euro 2016 qualifiers and featured for the Under-21s in their play-off against Croatia instead. 

However, Three Lions coach Neville believes it's only a matter of time before Berahino gets full recognition.

Speaking as a pundit on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football show, Neville said: 'If you're English and you score goals you've got a good chance. We haven't got many forwards that can play in the Premier League. There aren't a great deal of options.

'He's already in the system because he's playing for the U21s, so it's inevitable if he continues to score goals and play like he is he will come into the thoughts.'

Berahino put the Baggies 2-1 up against United, only for Daley Blind to score late on to rescue a point for the visitors.

While the result was disappointing, it was yet another goal for the 21-year-old hotshot.

'I felt like today I was focused and when that chance came I backed myself to take it and I was happy it went in today,' he said.

'I'm just enjoying my football, letting my football do the talking. If the goals keep coming that's great that I'm contributing to the team.'

Despite their disappointment at conceding late on, Craig Dawson said West Brom would be able to take the positives out of the performance.

'It was a great team performance,' he said. 'It was very difficult. They are a great side with great players. The team played very well and we need to take that to the next game.

'We can take positives from it and move on to the weekend.'
