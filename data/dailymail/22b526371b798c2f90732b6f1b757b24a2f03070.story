A woman in her 80s met her 94-year-old half-sister over the Memorial Day weekend — the first time the siblings had ever set eyes on each other.

KOTV reports that 85-year-old Zelda Gates didn't even know she had a half-sister until she read her father's will.

'It was a shock. My brothers and I looked at each other,' Gates said.

On Monday, Gates finally met Reta Knight, her older half-sister, in Jenks, about 12 miles south of Tulsa.

Knight says her father left her and her mother and she always wondered why.

She says her mother was evasive when she asked, so she didn't push the subject.

In the time after Knight's father left, he met Gates' mother and had Zelda.

Family members used old pictures and online genealogy resources to make sure of the connection.

'I just wondered what he was like and wondered how come he never tried to find mother or mother try to find him,' Knight said. 

'I don't know what the connection was, or what happened between them. I often wondered but I didn't know, and when I asked mother she was rather evasive, so I didn't push it.'

Now the two are catching up on quite a bit.

'I think it's wonderful, and we look so much alike, it's unbelievable,' Gates said.

'No I didn't say she looked like me, I just said she looked good, and I mean that,' Knight said with a laugh.

Gates says meeting her sister for the first time was wonderful.

She noted that the two look alike too.
