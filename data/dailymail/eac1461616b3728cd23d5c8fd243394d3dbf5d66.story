We’ve all wished someone from the future could send us tomorrow’s lottery ticket numbers.

While it may seem wishful thinking, a physicist from Cambridge University believes that, in theory, it could be possible.

He argues that if a thin wormhole stays open long enough, people might send messages instantly through time using pulses of light.

Wormholes are theoretical tunnels that create shortcuts in space-time. A study in May from Dr Luke Butcher at Cambridge University argued that if a thin wormhole stayed open long enough, people could send messages through time using pulses of light, or photons

Space-time can be warped and distorted. It takes an enormous amount of matter or energy to create such distortions, but theoretically, distortions are possible.

In the case of the wormhole, a shortcut is made by warping the fabric of space-time. Imagine folding a piece of paper with two pencil marks drawn on it to represent two points in space-time.

The line between them shows the distance from one point to the other in normal space-time.

If the paper is now bent and folded over almost double - the equivalent to warping space-time -  then poking the pencil through the paper provides a much shorter way of linking the two points, in the same way a wormhole would create a shortcut.

The problem with using wormholes to travel in space or time is that they are inherently unstable.  When a particle enters a wormhole, it also creates fluctuations that cause the structure to collapse in on it.

The latest study suggests there are unusual-shaped wormholes than may be able to stay open longer than normal.

It sounds like the stuff of science fiction, but the theory of wormholes being used to send objects through time was first suggested by Albert Einstein's calculations.

Wormholes are theoretical tunnels through the fabric of space-time that can create shortcuts for long journeys across the universe.

The problem with his theory is that, if wormholes exist, they don’t stay open long enough for a human, or even a single particle of light, to pass through them.

But a new study at Cambridge University suggests that some wormholes are capable of staying open long enough to send messages backwards and forwards through time.

In 1988, physicist Kip Thorne at the California Institute of Technology suggested that wormholes might be kept open through the use of a negative energy, known as Casimir energy.

According to modern physics, the vacuum is full of fluctuating electromagnetic waves of different possible wavelengths which creates a vast amount of energy, normally invisible to humans.

Between two parallel plates in a vacuum, some energy waves would be too large to fit through creating a negative Casimir energy. 

Einstein believed worm holes could open up a window into a different era. The problem with his theory is that, if worm holes exist, they don't stay open long enough for anything to pass through them. But a new study at Cambridge University suggests unusually-shaped wormholes could stay open longer than normal

Professor Luke Butcher’s recent paper builds on that theory by suggesting that if a wormhole is a lot longer than it is wide, the amount of Casimir energy naturally present inside it would be enough to allow it to stay open longer than normal.

‘My approach was to see if the wormhole itself – because it has a tube-like structure - could create the same effect as the plates,’ Dr Butcher told MailOnline.

‘My calculations showed that if a wormhole is very long compared to how wide it is, you can get negative energy created in the centre of the wormhole.

‘It’s not quite the right sort to keep the wormhole stable – which is what I’d hoped - but it does mean the wormhole collapses very slowly.'

The wormhole would be open just long enough, Dr Butcher suggests, to send a photon through to the centre.

The worm hole would be open just long enough, Dr Butcher suggests, to send a photon through to the other side. Because the ends of a wormhole can exist at different points in time, if Professor Butcher's theory proves correct, a message could be sent through time

Because the ends of a wormhole can exist at different points in time, if Professor Butcher’s theory proves correct, a message could be sent through time.

Dr Butcher warned a lot more work needs to be down to confirm his theory.

For instance, scientists still need to find out whether a pulse of light large enough to transmit a meaningful message can get through a collapsing wormhole and whether the pulse can actually escape the wormhole completely.

‘More calculations need to be done away from centre closer to mouths to see if the theory holds true,’ added Dr Butcher.

‘I would also like to look at the opposite case.

'Could a very short and fat worm hole be able to send messages through time?

‘This is all very much theoretical, but the possibilities are intriguing.’

If a message entered a wormhole, it could reach the future or the past

But wormholes are thought to collapse before a message could get out

Long enough, he claims, to carry a single particle of light through time

In theory, this photon could carry a message to a distant past or future
