New York City design boutique Sagmeister & Walsh has found a nude way to attract clients.

All six employees of the agency, which creates commercials, photos, apps, websites and other objects for clients, posed naked for their official staff photo, according to Business Insider.

The tradition began 19 years ago when Stefan Sagmeister founded the company, according to Sandbox Studios' video series The Creative Influence.

After leaving his job designing for big firms like Leo Burnett and TBWA, Sagmeister needed a good way to promote Sagmeister Inc.

He sent out a picture of himself naked with socks and a tasteful redaction bar, according to Sandbox Studios.

Now some of the firm’s high-profile clients include Universal Music/Jay-Z, Levi’s, the Rolling Stones and BMW.

When Jessica Walsh became a partner in the company a year ago, they did it again.

'We decided to make a re-make of that original mailer,’ Walsh told The Creative Influence. ‘Within an hour of sending out that email blast we were getting thousands of blogs and retweets.’

‘In that aspect it was quite a functional piece of design,’ Walsh added.
