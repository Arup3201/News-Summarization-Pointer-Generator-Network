A 14-year-old girl has been indecently assaulted in a Perth cinema, police say.

The teenager was watching a film in Cannington, south of the city, at 1.30pm on December 20 when a man seated nearby allegedly leant over and tried to talk to her. 

He then began grabbing her.

Police want to speak to this man, believed to be aged in his early 50s, after the indecent assault of a 14-year-old girl at the cinemas this month

The man left the theatre before the credits began to roll.

Police have released a photo of a man they believe may be able to help with their investigation.

He is described as being in his early to late 50s with fair skin, short black hair, a solid build and about 170cm tall.
