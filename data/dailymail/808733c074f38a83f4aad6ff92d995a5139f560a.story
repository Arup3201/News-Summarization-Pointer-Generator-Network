The record-breaking chill across the U.S. and Canada was so frigid it literally stopped Niagara Falls in its tracks.

A collection of spectacular photographs have shown the moment the U.S. side of the famous falls froze before they could reach the bottom.

Thankfully, the freezing air and 'polar vortex' that turned the cascading water to ice - and affected about 240 million people in the U.S. and southern Canada - will depart during the second half of this week, and a far-reaching January thaw will begin, according to AccuWeather.com.

In the incredible pictures, the Rainbow Bridge is seen with solid ice below it

The 'polar vortex' affected about 240 million people in the United States and southern Canada this week

The incredible pictures show frozen 
mist coating the landscape around Prospect Point at Niagara Falls State 
Park and the Rainbow Bridge is seen with solid ice below it.

Tuesday
 was a day of record-setting cold in Niagara, with the mercury bottoming
 out at a chilling -2F. Combined with the wind chills, it felt like 
-20F.

One
 would think the icy cold would keep tourists away, but those who 
enjoy taking photos rugged up to snap the conditions, producing 
exceptional images they wouldn't otherwise have an opportunity to capture.

The
 natural wonder should be looking more like itself come Saturday when 
temperatures are forecast to be in the 50s, according to Environment 
Canada.

But the record-breaking temperature didn't deter visitors

Tourists still visited the landmark to take pictures overlooking the falls in Ontario

The 'unprecedented' amounts of ice in the upper Niagara River, caused by the freezing conditions, caused a so-called ice jam and in turn flooding on Grand Island and Cayuga Island in Niagara Falls.

According to historical records, during only one year, 1848, has freezing weather caused the thousands of cubic feet of water per second flowing over the Niagara Falls to run dry, an event thought to have been caused by ice jamming and damming upriver, according to environmentalgraffiti.com.

Ice bridges spanning the Niagara River from bank to bank have formed as a result of various other chilly winters. In 1936, the American Falls, the shallower of the three waterfalls, are said to have frozen over completely.

One of the earliest images showing the frozen falls, in sepia tones, is believed to be from 1911 or 1912, though skeptics have questioned its authenticity because its photographer is unknown. In 1912, an ice bridge broke apart as several people were crossing it, sending three to their deaths.
