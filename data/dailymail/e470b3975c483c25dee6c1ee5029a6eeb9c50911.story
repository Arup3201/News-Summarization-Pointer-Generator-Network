Professor Anne Glover, pictured, claimed that opposition to genetically modified crops was a form of madness

Campaigners claimed a victory in their fight against genetically modified food last night after the EU scrapped the job of a controversial British scientist.

Professor Anne Glover, who served as chief scientific adviser to the EU from 2012, had argued that opposition to GM crops is ‘a form of madness’.

Groups worried about so-called ‘Frankenfoods’ wanted her position abolished, saying one adviser should not have so much influence on EU policy.

The EU Commission confirmed last night that her position was being abolished along with the Bureau of European Policy Advisers under which it fell.

The commission denied it had anything to do with her views on GM, but campaigners who had urged EU president Jean-Claude Juncker to scrap the role welcomed the decision.

A number of groups wrote to the commission this summer saying Professor Glover, a former chief scientist for Scotland, had presented ‘one-sided, partial opinions in the debate on the use of genetically modified organisms in agriculture, repeatedly claiming that there was a scientific consensus about their safety’.

Last night Liz O’Neill, of GM Freeze, one of the groups that wrote to the commission, said: ‘A single scientific viewpoint is a dangerous fallacy, so I very much hope that we can now look forward to a more widely informed dialogue.’

Dr Helen Wallace, of GeneWatch UK, said: ‘A single scientific adviser cannot possibly represent all the evidence and opinions relevant to the science policy debate.

‘There is a danger that chief scientific advisers become mere lobbyists for science funding, often in partnership with industry, and downplay scientific uncertainties and risks.’

Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, said: ‘Scientific advice is the cornerstone of sound policy making.

Campaigners hailed the scrapping of Prof Glover's important position at the heart of the EU Commission 

‘But the role of chief scientific adviser to the commission ended up hindering this process instead of helping it.’

While critics fear genetic modification of crops may pose ecological and health risks, farmers, scientists and multinational companies insist it is essential to boost agricultural productivity.

Last night supporters accused anti-GM groups of ‘shooting the messenger’. The National Farmers’ Union said abolishing Professor Glover’s role ‘appears to be a backward step for science’.

The European Commission said Mr Juncker believed in independent scientific advice but had not yet decided how to ‘institutionalise’ it.

Professor Glover, who was chief scientist for Scotland before she moved to the EU, said last year: ‘I am 99.99 per cent certain from the scientific evidence that there are no health issues with food produced from GM crops.

‘Opposition to GM, and the benefits it can bring, is a form of madness I don’t understand.’

Scientific bodies accused anti-GM groups of ‘shooting the messenger’, and had pleaded with the EU not to pander to green campaigners’ demands.

The National Farmers Union last night said the move was ‘deeply troubling’.

It said in a statement: ‘This appears to be a backward step for science. At a time when we need to address serious concerns around food security, energy security and the collective EU response to the threat of climate change, it is deeply concerning that the voice of science should be stifled.’

Nick von Westenholz, CEO of the Crop Protection Association, added: ‘This is troubling at a time when scientific endeavour should have a more important role than ever in tackling many European policy issues, not least in response to the food security challenge.’

And Sir Paul Nurse, president of The Royal Society, said: ‘Scientific advice must be central to EU policy making, otherwise you run the risk of having important decisions being unduly influenced by those with mixed motives.

Prof Colin Blakemore of the University of London, added: ‘It’s a sad day for science, policy, politics and the public in Europe.’

Julie Girling, Conservative MEP for South-West England, said: ‘I fear Mr Juncker has caved in to the green lobby.’

Professor Glover had been based within the Bureau of European Policy Advisers, which has now been scrapped.

It will be replaced by the European Political Strategy Centre, which will give scientific advice to the commission but will not include a single scientific adviser
