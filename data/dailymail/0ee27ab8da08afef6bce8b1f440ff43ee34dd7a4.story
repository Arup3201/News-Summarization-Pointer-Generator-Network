The BBC suppressed an independent review of its executive pay which found its top brass were paid up to three times more than their public sector counterparts.

Despite being warned four years ago that the pay of the director general and his lieutenants far outstripped what they might earn in equivalent jobs in the civil service, corporation bosses failed to take immediate action to curb top-level pay.

A study by accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) for the BBC Trust in 2009 found their basic salaries were instead on a par with the chiefs of aggressively profit-making FTSE 100 companies, despite the fact they are paid with licence fee payers’ money.

No action: Despite warnings, Corporation bosses failed to take action to curb top salaries

Instead of risking embarrassment by publishing it in full, BBC bosses kept the report under wraps until it was released under Freedom of Information laws.

Last night, MPs condemned the BBC for failing to publish the explosive findings earlier and said it illustrated a ‘fill your boots at public expense’ culture at the top of the corporation.

Laying bare the true extent of BBC largesse, the newly released documents reveal:

Last night Conservative MP Stephen Barclay, who sits on the influential public accounts committee of MPs, said executives would be asked to explain why the report was suppressed at its next hearing in September.

The PwC report was commissioned by former BBC Trust chairman Sir Michael Lyons in April 2009 in response to widespread dismay at senior staff bonuses that year.

Instead of publishing the report, the BBC’s executive remuneration committee – including Mr Thompson – discussed its findings in private and never published it in full.

Review: The PwC report was commissioned by former BBC Trust chairman Sir Michael Lyons in April 2009

At a meeting in July 2009, the committee decided BBC pay should be aligned with executives in the commercial public sector meaning the BBC could justify paying its executives far higher salaries.

Yesterday a BBC spokesman justified the decision to benchmark its pay against the commercial public sector by saying the corporation needed to compete for talent with commercial media rivals.

But Tory MP Stewart Jackson, who also sits on the public accounts committee, said: ‘There seems to have been a culture under the previous director general of “fill your boots at public expense and the expense of the licence fee payer”. The gravy train has finally hit the buffers. Those responsible must be held fully accountable for it.’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘A great deal has been done since 2009 to address issues around executive remuneration at the BBC.

‘Following this review, the senior management paybill has been reduced by more than 30 per cent, the director general’s salary has come down almost 33 per cent, while the ratio of director-general’s salary to median pay has fallen from 16.8 to 11 and bonuses have been permanently withdrawn from executive directors.’

The BBC’s executive remuneration committee was warned former director general Mark Thompson’s £651,000 basic salary was more than three times what he would be able to earn in an equivalent role in the civil service, Army or judiciary.

The corporation’s top ten earners, including former deputy director general Mark Byford on £609,000 and former chief operating officer Caroline Thomson on £430,000, were paid on average more than twice their public sector counterparts. On average, basic salaries were only 4 per cent lower than the private sector.

The BBC’s executive remuneration committee decided to use high-paying ‘commercial public sector’ institutions – such as Network Rail or the Tote – as a benchmark for pay rather than more frugal ‘core’ public sector examples, such as the civil service. Minutes show they realised the decision was ‘likely to be contentious’.

@highlight

Similar reviews have been carried out every year since 2009. They show executive salaries still exceed the agreed benchmark, but the BBC has redacted the documents to prevent the public from knowing by how much.
