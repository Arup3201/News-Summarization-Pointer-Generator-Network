A year on from the lowest moment of his career, Marin Cilic defeated Tomas Berdych to reach his second grand slam semi-final at the US Open.

Cilic dominated the match against sixth seed Berdych to win 6-2, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4) and set up a last-four clash with either Roger Federer or Gael Monfils.

The Croatian was not in New York 12 months ago. Instead he was serving a provisional ban after failing a drugs test.

The news had leaked out but the International Tennis Federation, who run the anti-doping programme, would not confirm it until Cilic had been found guilty of an offence.

That came in September and he was banned for nine months.

Cilic protested his innocence, his explanation that his mother had brought him tablets over the counter that he thought were the same as ones he knew to be clean.

His ban was reduced to four months on appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport last October and Cilic has been making up for lost time ever since.

Earlier this summer he beat Berdych on the way to the quarter-finals at Wimbledon, where he led Novak Djokovic by two sets to one before losing.

Now he has gone one better and it was thoroughly deserved against a lacklustre Berdych, who has had a disappointing summer.

Cilic won five of the first six games on his way to taking the first set and was quickly a break up in the second.

Berdych led 3-0 in the third but lost his break after becoming involved in an argument with umpire Louise Engzell over a double bounce call and was outplayed in the tie-break.

Cilic, whose previous slam semi-final came in Australia in 2010, is the first Croatian man to reach the last four at the US Open since his coach Goran Ivanisevic in 2006.

Outplayed: Czech player Berdych simply could not handle Cilic who was in magnificent form on Thursday
