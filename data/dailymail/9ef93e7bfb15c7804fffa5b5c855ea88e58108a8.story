The recent spate of White House fence jumpers represents just a fraction of the total number of people who breached barricades at the White House throughout the last five years, the Secret Service says.

A total of 40 people have illegally crossed into restricted areas outside the White House in fiscal years 2009 through 2014 the agency told Congress on Friday, according to The Washington Examiner.

That's more than twice as many as ex-Secret Service Director Julia Pierson intimated in testimony before Congress in late September.

This September 29 photo depicts an extra layer of barricades outside the White House that was set up after fence-jumper Omar Gonzalez was revealed to have forged deeper into the government building than what it was previously reported

A total of 40 people have illegally crossed into restricted areas outside the White House in fiscal years 2009 through 2014 the Secret Service reportedly told Congress on Friday

And that number doesn't include the seven people who made it into restricted areas inside the White House, including party crashing Real Housewives of D.C. stars Tareq and Michaele Salahi, the Examiner's report claims.

Of the 40 barrier-jumping incidents that the Secret Service says occurred, just 10 involved individuals hopping the permanent fencing outside the White House, acting Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in a letter on Friday.

The other 30 bypassed temporary blockades surrounding the complex such as police tape or movable metal barricades. 

The Examiner says most of those people were under the influence of drugs or alcohol or both. Several claimed to taking a shortcut to the D.C. Metro and a handful of others were out of towners who reportedly told police they didn't realize they were breaking the law.

Still the Secret Service arrests all but two of those individuals, the Examiner says.

One law-breaker violated a barrier to get a 'better view of the White House.' Two scaled Treasury to 'better display their signs during an anti-war demonstration.' 

A more serious breach in 2010 involved a person 'rambling religious references' and having 'hallucinations' as he charged the White House, threatening to assassinate the president.

On Independence Day in 2011 a man dressed up as Uncle Sam skirted a barrier at Blair House after having proclaimed at the White House earlier that day that the president owed him a significant amount of money.

Also included in the Secret Service's report to Congress, according to the Examiner, is a February 2013 episode in which a mentally ill man ignored security measures and stormed the White House trying to validate the president's existence.

'He believed he was no longer a real person and felt that the president possessed the ability to reinstate him,' the report stated. 

Of the 40 incident, 30 bypassed temporary blockades surrounding the complex such as police tape or movable metal barricades like the ones seen here in front of the White House on September 22

Four individuals have jumped the permanent fencing at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave this year alone. That number does not include mentally ill man, Dominic Adesanya, who assaulted two dogs on the White House lawn. Because that episode took place in October, after the end of the 2014 fiscal year, it will be counted as part of next year's stats

Just this year four people made it over the permanent barrier outside of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave and onto the lawn of the White House. 

That includes Omar Gonzales - the man who evaded multiple security officers and ran through the government building until he was tackled by an off-duty agent - but not the  mentally ill man, Dominic Adesanya, who assaulted two dogs while attempting to make his way into the building several weeks ago.

Because that episode took place in October, it will be counted as part of next year's stats. The government fiscal year ends on September 30, therefore the Secret Service report only includes incidents through that date.

The other three instances this year occurred in March, July and September.

Few details were released at the time about the March 30 intrusion other than to confirm that it happened and charges were being pressed against the unidentified male jumper. The Examiner says that he was stopped by a K-9 unit, however, and was subsequently treated at a hospital.

The news publication says that another mentally ill man jumped the fence sometime in July in hopes of giving his musical recordings to the president. He was arrested and ordered not to return to the premises.

In September two men, Gonzales, and a hardcore Pokemon fan scaled the White House fencing.

The affair with Gonzales took place on September 19. The other intrusion came days prior on September 11. 

White House reporters who witnessed the first incident snapped photos of Secret Service tackling a man wearing a yellow hat bearing the image of Pokemon character Pikachu. He was also carrying a stuffed replica of video game character.

The report obtained by the Washington Examiner and released on Monday night calls into question the congressional testimony of former Secret Service Director Pierson, who told a committee during a September 30 hearing that 16 people had jumped the fence since the fall of 2009.

'In addition to fence-jumpers, over the last five years hundreds of individuals have approached the White House perimeter, verbalizing threats to our protectees or acting in a suspicious manner,' Pierson said that the time. 'Officers and agents routinely leverage their experience and training to make decisions to either arrest or transfer these individuals to appropriate facilities for mental health evaluations.'

Pierson, who resigned the following day amid intense political pressure, did not detail every incident she considered to be a true barricade breach. However, the numbers provided in her testimony do not align with the Secret Service's latest report to Congress in which the agency listed 40 cases of barrier-jumping.
