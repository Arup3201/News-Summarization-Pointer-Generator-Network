Meet the newly appointed foreign minister of the self-proclaimed Republic of Lugansk.

Irina Filatova has been given the ministerial position in the region of eastern Ukraine where Russian nationalists are trying to forge states independent of Kiev.

Her appointment follows on from Natalia Voronina, who was recently declared the new Minister of Culture of Donetsk People's Republic, another self-proclaimed state in eastern Ukraine.

However, while Ms Voronina has appeared to try to avoid the focus on her looks, Ms Filatova seems to be a little less concerned.

Scarcely a day goes by without new pictures appearing of her from her life before her rise to the political heights of the new state.

Ms Filatova's page on the Russian social network VKontakte, welcomes the users with a profile picture of the foreign minister in her swimsuit and with a beer in the right hand. Although the account may be fake, the pictures are not.

A video of her shows her speaking in one of the 'press conferences' of the Lugansk People's Republic. She has spoken in the Rovenki City Hall.

Irina Filatova has been appointed foreign minister of the self-proclaimed Republic of Lugansk - one of two regions in south eastern Ukraine that pro-Russian forces have declared 'independent'.

The other self-declared 'nation' is the Donetsk People's Republic - which shares a border with Lugansk. Neither are recognised by any country.

Throughout April, a number government buildings in Lugansk were occupied by pro-Kremlin forces demanding the region be allowed to join the Russian Federation.

On April 27 protesters gathered outside the Regional Administration building to declare independence. They also unveiled plans for referendums to decide the region's future.

Two days later, with the Ukrainian government not responding to the protesters demands, up to 3,000 insurgents stormed and occupied the administration building.

Police officers guarding the building allegedly defected at this point and local flags were raised alongside those of the Russian Federation and of the Donetsk People's Republic.

A referendum held on May 11 asked voters whether or not they 'supported declaration of state independence of the Lugansk People's Republic?'.

Organisers claim 96.2 per voted in favour, although neither that figure nor claims of an 81 per cent turnout can be independently verified.

Both women follow in the footsteps of Natalia Poklonskaya, the Prosecutor General of the Republic of Crimea.

A video of Poklonskaya at a press conference on 11 March this year was uploaded to YouTube and went viral among Japanese and Chinese internet users. Within a month, the press conference was viewed over 1.7 million times.

Many fans even created anime-style images of her which were uploaded to the internet.
