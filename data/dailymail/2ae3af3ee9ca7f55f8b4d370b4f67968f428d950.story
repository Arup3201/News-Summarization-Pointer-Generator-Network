A former teacher was found guilty Monday of six felonies for bashing his wife on the head with a rock and pushing her off a cliff because of a dispute over an affair and a $4million inheritance.

Charles Black and his wife Lisa Zahn, both retired teachers from Kansas, had moved to the coastal Maine community of Camden - but argued over an affair Black had with an Arizona woman and how he spent money from the inheritance, which was from her father.

Prosecutors said the dispute culminated when Black, 71, hit his wife on the head with a rock before pushing her off 800-foot Maiden Cliff in April 2011.

Both Zahn and Black tumbled down the mountainside, and both were hospitalized for more than a week. Zahn said she believed he was pursuing her down the mountain, while Black told investigators that he had no memory of hitting her or pushing her off the cliff.

Black told police that he'd collected two rocks while they were on the mountaintop with the thinking that they'd toss them over the cliff, symbolizing getting rid of baggage and hoping for a fresh start.

The couple divorced in 2013 after nine years of marriage.

Zahn, 55, embraced prosecutor Geoff Rushlau on Monday after the jury convicted Black.

Rushlau said Black's punishment, which is pending, 'could represent a life sentence' for the defendant, who now lives in Salt Lake City.

'It's an absolute miracle that she's alive,' Rushlau said, adding that Black 'was trying to kill his wife — he failed in that effort.'

Black showed little emotion as the jury read its verdict. His attorney, Walter McKee, said he believed he had established a reasonable doubt, in part because there was none of Zahn's blood on Black's pants after the fall. But Rushlau argued in his closing statement that Zahn's blood was found on Black's shoes and jacket.

During the trial, Zahn testified that Black had an affair and spent inheritance money without seeking her permission. She said she recalled being hit three times on the head before being pulled to the cliff's edge. She landed on a ledge and made her way to the bottom to get help.

The Camden Herald reported the Black's mistress - and former high school girlfriend - Candice Carter earlier testified that their affair started after she reached out to him on Facebook.

After Zahn suffered a perforated bladder in January 2011, Carter testified Black told her his wife's death 'will be the easy way out,' the newspaper reported.

In court, Rushau said that Black's nighstand held a book with Carter's signature, according to Bangor Daily News.

An estate lawyer also testified in court that Black 'was much more active in the [estate planning] meetings than Lisa,' the Daily News reported.

Black did not testify during the trial.

During the trial, Black was barred from staying in Camden, where his former wife continues to live, because he was deemed to be a threat.

He was held without bail pending sentencing, which has not been set.
