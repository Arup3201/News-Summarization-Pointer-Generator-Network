A pensioner was arrested last night after allegedly throwing a banana at the referee during AFC Wimbledon's 2-2 draw with Port Vale.

The 74-year-old Dons fan was interviewed by police before being released on bail.

The incident harks back to the days when black footballers regularly had bananas thrown at them, but it is not thought to have been racially motivated.

'We saw the banana thrown on to the pitch and then reviewed television coverage,' football intelligence officer Sam Cunningham told This Is Staffordshire.

'It appears a supporter was angered by a decision by the referee and aimed a banana at him. It was not aimed anywhere near any player.'

The League Two game at Kingsmeadow in Kingston-upon-Thames finished 2-2, leaving the host club at the top of the table in the division.

Wimbledon fans took to the internet to blast the pensioner's actions.

Shameful: Liverpool winger John Barnes pictured in 1987 kicking away a banana which was thrown at him

'Hopefully the stupid person who 
threw the item onto the pitch gets a lifetime ban from the Club,' one 
supporter wrote on an online fan forum. 'We do not want you back.'

Another added: 'Not sure what's 
worse, the fact that some t*** threw something on the pitch or the fact 
that he wasn't immediately pointed out or given a good kicking by those 
around him.'

Bananas being thrown on to the pitch has long been associated with the racism that blighted football in the 1980s.

A
famous image shows England legend John Barnes flicking a banana off the
pitch after it was thrown at him while playing for Liverpool.

Thankfully,
racism is now only a rare occurrence in the stands, although the 
football authorities and police continue to work together to combat any 
incidents.
