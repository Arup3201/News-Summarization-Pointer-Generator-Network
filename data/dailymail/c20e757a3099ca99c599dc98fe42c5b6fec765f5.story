Harry Redknapp confirmed he will remain at QPR next season after leading the club back to the Premier League at the first attempt.

There has been speculation surrounding Redknapp's future with talk that the 67-year-old may be ready to retire from the dug out.

But less than 24-hours after winning promotion to the top flight, Redknapp confirmed he will be at the club next season.

QPR celebrated with their fans at Loftus Road following their dramatic play-off final win over Derby at Wembley on Saturday.

Bobby Zamora was the match winner as his last-minute strike was dubbed the £134million goal due to the value of being in the Premier League next season.

Redknapp was joined on the pitch by chairman Tony Fernandes and posed alongside a personalised Caterham car.

Captain Clint Hill lead the squad in a lap of honour as the players, including Joey Barton, mingled with fans and signed autographs.

Redknapp added: 'It's great that the people have turned up and that's what it's all about, they love their club and have got their colours on - that's what you do it for. We made their year and we are looking forward to the Premier League.

'Being back in the Premier League is fantastic, playing all those teams and bringing them down here to Loftus Road. We will have a go and try and stay in the division.'

Plenty of names have already been mentioned as possible incomings to Loftus Road for next season, but Redknapp says he has not thought about it yet and was waiting on the outcome of Saturday's play-off final.

He said: 'I haven't even thought about a player for next year - honestly, everything depended on yesterday, the result was key to the whole football club. We got that result and are in the Premier League so now we can start looking forward to next year.

'It's going to be a busy time, we haven't started to organise anything. We need to organise a pre-season, where we are going for a training camp, pre-season games, players out of contract, players you are looking to bring in. It's going to be a busy month or so.

'We got rid of 18 players in the summer and a lot of them were very good players. The squad got decimated because we had to cut the wage bill so I never felt that it was a team certain to go up. At the start of the year I would have took the play-offs.'
