Ever wonder what your pets are up to when you're out of the house? One Ukrainian developer has taken the concept of keeping tabs on his pet one step further and incorporated robotic controls into a camera so he can watch, talk to and play with his dog when he's out of the house.

Petcube is a robotic camera and laser created by Alex Neskin after he moved to a new apartment and heard from neighbors that his dog, Rocky, was making a lot of noise when Alex had left the house.

Alex set up a controlled web cam to see what Rocky was up to in his absence.

Prototype: Alex has 'always been interested in robotics' and created this camera and laser set-up to keep his dog Rocky entertained while Alex was out

'What I saw wasn't so pleasant,' says Alex, describing the dog barking at the front door of his apartment for hours on end.

'Then I understood that I needed some kind of interaction with Rocky,' Alex says. 'The solution came out of Rocky's favorite toy - laser stick [laser pointer].'

Alex attached a laser pointer to the controlled webcam, 'And every time I moved the camera, the laser moved too,' he says, which sent Rocky off in wild pursuit and kept him away from the front door.

Creator: Petcube creator Alex Neskin and his girlfriend moved to a new apartment with their dog Rocky and quickly discovered Rocky was making a lot of noise when they were out

Alex says the device meant he could play
with Rocky when he wasn't at home, just like they would if they were 
together. But it wasn't just Alex playing with Rocky - he made a website
so that his friends could go and play with Rocky too.

'All of them wanted to have such a robot to play with their pets,' says Alex.

That's when Alex had the idea to develop Petcube on a larger scale, and gathered a small team about him to put the concept into production.

Petcube: This is the Petcube that's going into production, which is made of aluminum and glass and has changeable 'skins' to match your decor

'Our goal is to develop a really nice looking robot that can fit any interior,' he says. The prototype is a sleek aluminum and glass box that need only be connected to WiFi and it's ready to go.

Users simply go to the Petcube website or connect through iOS or Android to begin playing with their pets, meaning they can be entertaining Fido from virtually anywhere.

According to the Petcube website, the first Petcubes will be ready to ship by fall.

The Petcube has a 160-degree wide-angle camera that streams 720 pixel video, a low-intensity laser pointer on a moveable platform, a microphone and speakers.

Users can share access to their Petcube with family and friends, and even make it public so that anyone can play with their pets. People without a Petcube can go online and play with pets whose owners have made their Petcube public.
