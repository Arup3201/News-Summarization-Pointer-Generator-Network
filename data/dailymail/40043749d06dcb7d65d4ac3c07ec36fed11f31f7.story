David Cameron was embarrassed last night after he was caught on film telling Angela Merkel that it was ‘good’ that John Terry was disqualified from playing in last night’s Champions League final in Munich.

It is not clear what the Prime Minister was referring to, but the England captain will stand trial in July on a charge of racially abusing Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand during a game last October.

Terry denies the charge. Ferdinand, who has told officers he did not hear the alleged comments, is expected to give evidence during the trial.

The Prime Minister’s comments, picked up by a microphone on a television camera as he made small talk with the German leader during the G8 summit at Camp David in the US, were described by legal experts as ‘poorly judged if he thought he could be overheard’.

Terry was one of four Chelsea players banned for the Champions League final against Bayern Munich after being sent off in Chelsea’s semi-final victory over Barcelona for an off-the-ball knee in the back of  Alexis Sanchez.

According to ITV News, Ms Merkel said to Mr Cameron: ‘John Terry is not there,’ to which Mr Cameron replied: ‘That’s good.’

Meanwhile, Labour yesterday seized on revelations about David Cameron’s leisure habits, claiming it explained why ‘the economy is in such a mess’.

The Prime Minister was reported to ‘chillax’ by enjoying karaoke, snooker, tennis, several glasses of wine with lunch and an addictive iPad game,  Fruit Ninja, which requires the player to slice fast-moving fruit with a  cartoon sword.

Labour said it confirmed the image of a ‘DVD Dave’ who is ‘always relaxing’.

According to a biography, Mr Cameron has even installed a machine at his Chequers country retreat that fires tennis balls, which he has nicknamed ‘the Clegger’ in tribute to Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg’s aptitude for the game.
