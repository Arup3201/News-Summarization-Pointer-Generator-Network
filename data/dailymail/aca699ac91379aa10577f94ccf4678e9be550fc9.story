Thousands of elderly patients are at risk of going blind because of long NHS waiting times, eye specialists warn.

Nearly three-quarters of doctors say patients suffering with the aggressive wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) had to wait more than the recommended two weeks for their first sight-saving injection.

Many also wait too long for follow up treatment, according to the survey by the Royal College of Ophthalmologists and the Macular Society charity.

Thousands of elderly patients are at risk of going blind due to long NHS waiting times according to eye specialists 

Rising demand from an ageing population and financial pressures mean patients suffering from conditions such as AMD – which can cause blindness if left untreated – are not getting the help they need in time, it is claimed.

AMD is the biggest cause of sight loss in the UK, with the wet form affecting about 40,000 new patients each year. The dry type of AMD is more common but less severe and slower in affecting vision.

If caught in time, the wet form can be treated using a drug injected into the eye every few weeks. 

But untreated wet AMD can rob a person of their central vision in a few weeks, while delayed treatment is also less effective.

People at risk of going blind from glaucoma can be identified by looking at how their eyes move when they are watching TV, claim scientists at City University London.

They used a tracking device to map eye movements, which identified lost peripheral vision, says a report in the journal Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience.

It is hoped the discovery will lead to quicker treatment.

Other similar diseases of the retina caused by diabetes and blocked blood vessels are now treatable in the same way for tens of thousands of new patients every year, and clinics are struggling to cope, say doctors.

The survey of 226 consultant ophthalmologists found more than three-quarters blamed medical staff shortages for the delays.

More than half also said that NHS managers do not give wet AMD a high enough priority.

Staff shortages mean non-medical workers are being drafted in to give sight-saving treatment in many hospitals. 

Bernie Chang, chairman of professional standards at the Royal College of Ophthalmologists, said: ‘Most ophthalmic departments are finding it difficult to cope with demand for this treatment and a third are now using non-medical staff to give injections.

‘We need a significant increase in capacity to be able to deliver services that are sufficient, as well as efficient. It is essential not to give this treatment late as vision will be lost unnecessarily.’ 

Tony Rucinski, chief executive of the Macular Society, said: ‘We know many areas of the NHS are struggling, but elderly people with AMD need and deserve proper care. It is devastating to lose your vision.

Rising demand from an ageing population and financial pressures mean patients suffering from conditions such as AMD are not getting the help they need in time, it is claimed

‘There will be hundreds of thousands of patients with wet AMD in the coming years. The cost to individuals and to society of not treating them properly will be enormous.’

Bev Langton, 61, from Wem in Shropshire, has been helping her mother battle to get her appointments for wet AMD treatment within the time limits recommended by her consultant.

She said: ‘My mother is in her 90th year. The clinical care at Shrewsbury Hospital has been excellent, but there has been a constant frustration that the appointment waiting times are consistently much longer than the consultant recommends.

‘It is frustrating, and we have to question whether the constant delays have caused my mum any avoidable sight loss.’
