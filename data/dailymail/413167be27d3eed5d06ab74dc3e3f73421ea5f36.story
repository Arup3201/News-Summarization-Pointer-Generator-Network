Clive Woodward's big match analysis 

There was no hiding place from the giant new Twickenham screens. There it all was: incorrect decisions, revealed close up with replays, slow motion with HD quality and booed widely around the stadium. The new, almost shadow-free floodlights cast further light on other mistakes by the referee.

When is a try not a try? When it’s shown on scoreboards that look as big as cinema screens for everyone else to see what the referee has missed.

In football, they aren’t allowed to expose contentious decisions inside the stadium for fear of increasing pressure on the referee or starting a riot of idiots. 

The new giant screens at Twickenham were used for the first time during England's defeat by New Zealand

The screens - each measuring 169sq metres - were hung from the roof behind both posts

Replays on the big screen cast doubt on Aaron Cruden's try - which was awarded by referee Nigel Owens

Inside Twickenham, they have a different class of audience and so they showed those moments again and again to a cascade of boos, although the chap from the Sunday Times wrote that official Nigel Owens had ‘an excellent’ game in his report. 

I guess he had the advantage of seeing all of the game and didn’t have to queue for his refreshments.

I missed three minutes at the of the first first half to try to get ahead of the stampede, the entire half time and another five minutes of the second half before I was served. A total of 23 minutes for two pints of Guinness, costing £6 each (in a 'fan cup'). Enough time for a Scandinavian chap in the queue to remark: ‘We could have gone to Dublin and got this quicker.’

Chris Foy’s match report, published instantly to MailOnline on the final whistle, informed me what I had missed, but when you’ve paid £89 each for two tickets high up in the East Stand, you are entitled to think you might get to see the whole game for yourself.

Surely, for all their impressive £76m revamp at rugby’s HQ, there has to be a way of getting served in less than 23 minutes.
