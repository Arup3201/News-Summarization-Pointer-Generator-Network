An official portrait of New York mayor Michael Bloomberg was unveiled at City Hall on Monday to commemorate the end of his third and final term in office.

The portrait shows Bloomberg standing over his bullpen at City Hall, the infamous open-plan office that was at the epicenter of his mayoral organization for the past 12 years.

Artist Jon Friedman has captured a good likeness of Bloomberg’s favored stoic pose with his lips pursed in his trademark half-smirk/half-frown expression.

In the oil on canvas painting, Bloomberg wears a dark suit and an unusual purple tie. A badge on his lapel and his cufflinks feature an apple-shaped design that looks uncannily like the Applebee’s logo.

The city's 108th mayor, Bloomberg imported the bullpit concept from his Wall Street days and has spent a large part of the past 12 years seated at a desk the same size as the 51 others.

He donated the computers and paid for breakfast and light lunch for his entire staff every day - a cost of about $890,000 over the course of his tenure.

Critics are divided with regards to Bloomberg's legacy. While many New Yorkers found him arrogant and insensitive to the needs of the poor, he has been at the helm during a period of tremendous growth and prosperity for the city.

The painting, which will be displayed outside City Hall's Blue Room, ‘was privately funded and is a gift to the city,’ according to NYC.gov.

Enclosed in a gilt frame, it measures 50" by 36" and will have pride of place next to Rudy Giuliani in a chronological procession of portraits of his predecessors.

By way of a comparison, Giuliani’s portrait showed him leaning on a railing.

Friedman, whose work is also displayed at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, paints from photographs. This portrait was based on an image taken on June 27.

On January 1, Democratic Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio will be sworn in by Bill Clinton.
